3,Last less than 3 years,"It died today. Kept trying to reboot it's self. Wouldn't take a charge. Then later it stopped all that and the charge light went off. But the charger still works on my iphone so I know it's good. I used this product about one week every two months. It just didn't work when I went to use it today. It did sit in my car a couple of days when the temp in the car might have hit 100 degrees. Up until today, it was flawless! I did make sure to never drop it. Reading on my iphone is okay for a back up. But not crazy about it. It was 5 stars while it worked. Just thought for $189.oo it should have lasted longer. I'll go for the cheapest one next time (today). Although my family is pressuring me for the 'fire' version. Not crazy about the back-lighted screen though. Owned this model for 2 years and 8 months."
1,Replacement Device,Purchased 12/13/09.Returned requesting replacement 1/7/10.Have not received replacement or explanation by 1/31/10.
2,Not worth it,"Everything about the Kindle screams overpriced. This technology will be antiquated within the year - two at the most. The Kindle is definitely on to something, but it's not worth $260 plus the price of books. There's no reason the books should be priced so high for new/newer books."
2,Bigger Screen for Me,"I tried for months to convince myself to get a Kindle 2 but always came back to the same conclusion....screen is too small for my tastes (smaller than a paperback). However, I decided to order one and actually see and touch the real thing (how could all these reviewers be wrong). I loved the look, feel and finish of the Kindle 2 but still could not see using it long term with such a small screen (I plan to use on vacations, business trips to read newspapers as well as novels)I returned it and now have to decide now if I want to spend $489 for the DX which seems to have what I consider the correct size screen....along with the other same great attributes of the Kindle 2."
5,Why don't you allow Kindle to handle .Epub ebooks as well???,Well... since this is one of the best e-readers... why not making it THE BEST by allowing it to read .epub files .....?NOW THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING !!! RIGHT??
1,Not a safe place for your ebooks,"Was really looking forward to picking up one of these, especially since Amazon is making it easier to put PDFs and regular ebooks on it. The Kindle looks like it would be great for long plane trips, train rides, vacations, etc.However what changed my mind was reading about how Amazon remotely connected to every Kindle and deleted purchased copies of 1984 and Animal Farm, and gave customers a credit. Turns out the publisher decided they didn't want to sell the books afterall. Those were LEGAL, PAID FOR EBOOKS PURCHASED BY AMAZON CUSTOMERS.Would you accept Barnes and Noble breaking into your house and stealing your purchased paper copy of 1984 and leaving money on your dresser along with a note that the publisher decided they didn't want to sell the book afterall?If you're a book lover, avoid buying one of these at all costs. Your books may just disappear in the night!"
3,It just can't replace a book,"For as much as i was excited about this nice little gadget, the excitement wore off about a week after i had it. I got it in november and i haven't used it in a while. It's great but it just does not replace a book.I tried reading the Bible on it and it's definitely not ideal because the Bible is usually not read as a normal book but skipping back and forth through different books and chapters. i can't just go to the verse i want to, and the highlighting and notes features are great but i find it easier to find a verse through the real highlighting on a real book, especially when you have many highlights. And it's just not convenient if you read a book and want to read again a specific part, i can remember easily where it was in a real book but on a kindle it's hard to identify. But i like the kindle because it definitely saves a lot of trees which is always a great thing. So I'd recommend it to read stories on it but not a study book"
4,Simplicity,My Kindle arrived user friendly and ready to use right out of the box. I was engrossed in a book in about 45 seconds.
5,LOVE IT,"I am an avid reader and I love it. No more moving boxes, no more packing 2-3 books for one trip for vacation. Whatever I want to read, whenever I want to read it. Awesome!"
5,Maybe a little too good...,"It is hard to express how much I enjoy my kindle 2. The biggest problem is that it has rekindled the desire to read for my wife. Now we have to share it, and she is extremely stingy.I have just a few criticisms. I think it might be kind of nice if there was a next page button on the top where the ""Amazon Kindle"" tag is because sometimes I like to rest my hand on the top of the device when I'm reading in bed. Second, the cursor response is also a tad slow when navigating through a page to look up a word. Finally, the next page buttons seem a bit unresponsive if pressed on either the upper or lower edge."
3,It's Really Nice But The Grayish Screen Makes It Hard To Read!,"I love my kindle and it's nice to be able to download books so quickly.My issue is the grayish reading screen. The book covers in the bookstore are almost impossible to read against the gray screen and the text fades into background after reading for a while. I keep wanting to adjust the screen.I got the kindle app for my iphone. I find it more pleasant to read my books on the iphone because the iphone background is white. I literally have to turn off my kindle and continue reading on my iphone.The ability to switch the screen from grayish to white should be a part of the kindle settings. Other than this major problem, the other kindle features are great."
4,Cool gift for my sister,I gifted this for my sister for this thanksgiving!!She loves it and making use of all options available.Worthy gift!!
4,Great concept,"I purchased the Kindle about 3 weeks ago and am very happy with it. I have read 4 books since. I also purchased the kindle case after owning the reader for a few days because I found it needed a cover and a bit more steadiness. The cover needs a more secure fastening on the right side to prevent the Kindle from torquing off and damaging the locking pins.As to the Kindle itself, the only thing I feel needs real improvement is the on/off switch. I would prefer that it be a simple slide switch as opposed to the ""slide it to the right and hold for a few seconds"" type. I invariably put it into sleep mode as opposed to just shutting it off. Other than that 1 minor flaw it is a great device."
5,"Love, Love Kindle 2","Where was I before Kindle came along? I am an avid reader - books all throughout the house - and now there is Kindle 2. Extremely easy to read, operate and navigate. For anyone wondering whether or not to make this purchase, my answer would be to go ahead it make it. Kindle 2 is definitely worth the money."
3,"Good, but room for improvement","If you just want to read books on the kindle, then it's fantastic. The quality of type is second to none. The only place the kindle really falls down is usability for me. I found myself having to consult the manual on a number of occasions to get simple features going. The other disappointing thing is the lack of pictures. I have read several articles from newspapers that are referring to the 'picture above', but on the kindle, there is no picture. Also, in Andre Agassi book Open, a friend asked what i thought of the pictures in the book, which i had to reply that my kindle version of the book contained no images :(Another note, I found that the internet browser didn't work for me in the UK, however it does in Sydney. Although, I would strongly not recommend this as not an internet surfing device."
3,Device is nice..book text is terrible,"I have been enjoying my new device. The ease of use makes reading better.My problem is that the assembly of the book contents of a book that I currently have in ""hard bound' reflects a lack of professonal editing. Comparing Andrew Greeley's Irish Whiskey in book form with the Kindle version shows many typos and scrambled sentences. If I was the good Father, I would sue!!!!!!!!"
3,Kindle Books,"I purchased this product on the back of recommendations from work colleagues that have already bought one. I agree that it is simple to use, easy to read, looks good etc, etc. Basically does what it says on the box. However the big drawback for me, a UK resident, is the choice, or lack of choice of books to download. The advertising blurb said thousands available, but very few by the authors that interest me, my mistake, I should have made proper enquiries before buying. In fact, I am so disappointed in this aspect of Kindle that I'm going to ask for a refund on the basis that, due to no fault of mine I am unable to use it to its full capability."
4,registered kindle but....,"I love my kindle but I ordered a book from the amazon.ca site and it came by post and the next day it was downloaded to my kindle so I had to pay twice for it..2 different charges! Now I have a pre-order in for another book due the end of April . Can't I switch it so it only comes into my kindle.Is pre-order not an option? I looked for answers on the amazon.ca site for help, but couldn't find an answer."
3,K,"Impossible to introduce in Kindle files,books not from Amazon,edtc.Not yet familiarized with the item.Your instruccions ""Transferring,Downloading,etc"" difficult to uderstand and apply.Few books in Spanish."
2,Needs backlight!,The Kindle is a great product except that it lacks a backlight. Wish I would've known that before I purchased but that is my fault. I thought I had found a great solution to keeping my husband up with my reading light. Oh well...
5,Awesome,"Great product, ideal for reading, nice slim design; only one problem, it only works wirelessly to download books on the US, in other parts of the world you need to plug it in to the computer."
1,"Great for Big Brother, not so great for you","Given that Amazon has taken to deleting books that people have legally purchased (Orwell's 1984 and Animal Farm - God the irony is almost too thick to cut!) I cannot recommend this product. At least with dead tree versions of books I can be fairly certain nobody will enter my house at night, remove books from my shelf, and leave me ten dollars on my nightstand.Amazon, you violated your customer's trust. I hope you pay dearly for this very bad decision."
1,Beware.,"Such high hopes and significant expense. I began a true believer, and in a short time, the glitches came, and then - no kidding folks - a two foot drop (sitting in a chair), from the ridiculous carrying case onto a PADDED GYM FLOOR.And that was it. I'm a frequent traveler, looked forward to the convenience, and now just feel ripped off for a significant amount of money. Beware."
5,Best item on Amazon,I love my kindle! I carried the one kindle on vacation while my mother-in-law hauled along 5 books. It was a great space saver and you never will run out of books when you need one!
5,Klassy Konvenient Kindle,"I love my Kindle. It's lightweight; the battery lasts and lasts; being able to increase the font size is fantastic; and I never lose my place. Being able to buy a new book any time of the day or night, without going to the book shop or waiting for delivery, is also superbly convenient."
5,I love my Kindle,"I received the Kindle for my birthday on June 14 from my husband. I have already read several books and have it loaded with several more books for a cruise next week. The books are so very easy to download and inexpensive. One charge lasts a long time, and it is the most convenient way to enjoy reading. Love it and my husband for getting it for me."
4,Loving it!,"I have been waiting for my Kindle since before Oprah made it famous. My very generous family gave me enough gift cards for Christmas to buy the Kindle. I swore I'd never give up a real live book but the Kindle almost makes me want to. I've had it for several hours now (a day early THANK YOU Amazon) and I absolutely love it. It was worth the wait! You truly forget you are reading on an e-device. The gray background takes a little getting used to but it doesn't take that long. Turning the pages is easy and fast. I love the fact you can browse and buy from Kindle store right from the device. The dictionary is so simple to use while you are reading, it's ingenious. Why four stars? I wish the display was a little bigger i.e., not so much white border. Other than that-I am a tried and true Kindle lover already."
1,Amazon can delete your books at any time.,Amazon has incorporated DRM features into the Kindle which allows Amazon to delete any title you purchase at any time. Amazon has already used this feature to delete books that were purchased from users Kindle readers.
1,Amazon-1984 Prime reason not to by a Kindle,"I was planning to buy a Kindle this week, but this event - Amazon's ability and willingness to erase, at will, content from a Kindle - has changed my mind. I will not buy a Kindle,and will greatly limit my purchases on Amazon. This action by Amazon is outrageous, what is to stop them from deleting other material?You spend $300 for a Kindle, you presume it's yours, but is it yours if the seller has the ability to alter it's contents at will? Sorry Amazon, you just showed your true nature... you have this power that most Kindle owners never imagined you have, and you used the power to steal. A decision was made, and yes, to take a legally owned possession away from someone is stealing. It would appear that Amazon is just another corporate thief."
4,Cool! Even for an old lady!,"This is so exciting for a 70-year-old non-techie! I love books, but it is so amazing to click a button and have a whole book, and then another, in a tiny tablet. I can travel w/ so many books and not have it weigh more than I do. And I can read in the bathtub as Jeff Bezos did. One of these days, I'll even read the instructions. Who knows what I'll find out?"
1,Kindle system can remotely erase books,I found out recently from the New York Times that the Kindle system can remotely erase your books. The Digital Rights Management system prevents you from reading your books on other systems and now the remote erasing system prevents you from reading your books on your Kindle. I don't really think any of this makes any sense.[...]
2,No Public Library support through Adobe Digital,If there is one good reason to own a e-book reader its the ability to go to your public library's website and borrow the latest books for free. Unfortunately Kindle does not let you do this. Sony PRS-505 wins in this category.
4,I've Used the Kindle 2,"I was fortunate enough to get to try the Kindle 2 for a week. Yes, I'm in the video testimonial.It appeared to me that Amazon addressed most of the issues conveyed by Kindle 1 customers. What jumped out at me were better navigation and layout, more secure back plate and the text to voice translator. Very cool. You can pick a male or female voice and adjust the rate of translation. The voice does not sound robotic and even has some inflection.I rated it four stars because I think the cover should be included.All said it's great and getting better. My Kindle 1 works fine, so I'll stick with it a while longer.To all those who ordered. Enjoy. It's amazing to get a book in 60 seconds."
4,one thing that is missing,The kindle is very easy to use and I have been able to read a lot more books because it is so easy to download an interesting book. It would be useful to have a clock at the top of the page as I sometimes get so engrossed reading a book I forget to check the time and sometimes stay up too late.
5,I can't believe I waited so long!,"A friend of mine got a Kindle when they first came out and I kept telling myself I was going to get one. I kept finding other things to spend the money on, but finally decided I worked hard for that money, I was going to reward myself. I absolutely love my Kindle, and can't believe I waited so long to buy one!!!"
4,"Kindle 6"" reader","I just got the Kindle in December, but it has been great. I've recommended to several others. The one concern I have is that twice it has ""lost its mind"". the first time it lost all the books I had already purchased. When I turned it on and off again they finally returned. The second time I had read way into a book and it forgot the last page read. It never did remember it, I had to laboriously page through to the last page read.Aside from those issues, it is a great traveling companion for someone who reads a lot."
3,good job,the reader is a good way to read the books but needs better connection to amazon than att they do not give very good service in southern oregon.
2,Love My Kindle!!,"I had heard about the Kindle before Christmas 2009. I thought it was too pricey for me. I love to read, but couldn't justify the purchase. This Spring I knew I was going to have surgery and would be off work for two weeks. I told my husband about the Kindle, and as always he said - Buy It!! I read reviews from other customers and convinced myself to buy one. I was interested to know that there are free books, along with new releases for under $10.00. I am so happy that I bought one and love, love, love it. I have read four free books in the last several weeks. The instructions are easy and operation has been wonderful. I would recommend a Kindle to all readers."
4,"Good, but a little lacking in PDF support","The Kindle 2 is good, but it is a bit lacking in PDF support. I don't like the fact that if you don't have good eyesight you have to read them in landscape mode.For everything else, I love the Kindle. I have already saved a lot of money on college books. I live in Norway, so Amazon books usually comes with some shipping costs. But that is eliminated on the Kindle.So; I love most of it, but they should improve PDF support in the future."
3,Problem with All Kindles,"First, I have nothing against the 6 inch kindle now that the price is dropping. In fact I almost bought one, until I started looking at the e-book prices. I thought that $9.99 was a little high, but now I see the prices going up to $14.99. I know that some are lower, but I also see recently published books at $12.99 up to 14.99. I don't know where it will stop, and I do not want to buy a kindle and not use it because of the price of e-books. By buying the physical book at the same or lower price, check Cosco prices. There are also lots of used book stores. I can loan them out or donate them to places that get them to people that do not have good access to books.It is not the Kindle that gets the low rating, but the ever increasing price of the e-books.Chuck"
1,Kindle wouldn't work,"Received Kindle in a timely manner, as with all my Amazon purchases, however it would never power up. Plugged it in and got a yellow light, which was supposed to turn green and never did. It also stated that you could use the Kindle while it was charging, but could not. Did all the troubleshooting examples but nothing worked. Ended up returning it. Can't decide whether to give it another try or not."
3,hoping for more!,"I love the convenience of carrying something that fits so easily into my purse that I can pull it out and into my book in a flash. I am desperately hoping that more professional books, ie, mental health in particular, and newspapers--National Catholic Reporter--will belong to the Kindle Library soon!!"
1,No help with problem,"I got my Kindle for my birhday 13 Feb 2010.I loved it.Now I have a problem everything goes to archives and I can get it out of there.I have emailed ,phone begged them to help me.They promise to phone back but only did once to tell me they are working on the problem but now the problem is still not solved and I dont hear from them.After sale service??? No very bad"
2,Lousy as a PDF reader,"Lousy as a PDF reader because there is no scroll / slider button. What it does is cut the PDF file at random into chunks of page (according to the zoom setting used). Thus, zoom too small and you cannot read, too big and the text gets chopped in the middle of a line. My reading interest is Gutenberg / Googlebooks / National Library scans of out of copyright old books, not buying new books from Amazon. The text ones work OK, but there is not enough memory available to store a ""library"" like advertised. Mine is the ""Pocket"" version. I guess the whole page one would solve the viewing problems because it is A4 size, but I could probably get better value out of a ""Comic Reader"" type machine for PDF use."
5,I was really skeptical... I love books!,"I was skeptical at first. I love to read, and love traditional books, so I thought I would give it a try. The Kindle is fantastic! I have read several books on it so far - and I have only had it for about 3 weeks. It is so much more comfortable to hold and read that holding open a paperback or a heavy hard cover. I commute to work, and it always seemed that I did not have the book that I was in the mood to read. Now, I have all the books that I am reading with me at all times without having to carry several books that weigh my bag down.I love the built in dictionary as well.I do have to say I do not care for the magazine or newspaper feature. I rather read the paper for free online and see all the graphics.The final bonus - I don't need to get a bigger bookshelf to house books that I am only going to read once."
5,Wonderful product,"I just received my Kindle 2 and had some concerns about the viewing area and size of the text. I have an ""eye issue"" and noticed it was getting harder to read books. The Kindle solved that problem in a flash. It is so much easier to read than a paper page and you can adjust the font size as needed. For older readers, I think this would be the answer to any reading problems. Great item!!"
4,"Kindle=Awesome, Shipping=Miserable!!","Ok. My Kindle is scheduled to come tomorrow by 7 pm. This morning I woke up and tracked my package. It said it was in Charlotte, NC, where I live. Then, at 4 pm today, it was magically in Greensboro, NC, 3 hours from my house!!! My question is simple, how does a big package like that go from being thirty minutes away, to three hours away??? I can't wait to get my Kindle. I seems so awesome. I tried out a family member's, and loved it. The next day I ordered one of my own. I can't wait, but seriously, does that make sense?"
4,Park bench,"Sure the Kindle seems to be good, although I don't own one. I just wanted to make the observation that you can't put a Kindle in your back pocket (for men). Some men still do this. Maybe they should make a Kindle with hinges."
2,Will Wait for Kindle # 3 or maybe #4!,"At first glance this seemed like a fantastic product; however, it seems to have a lot of negative attributes. I have arthritic hands and find tiny cell phone buttons a challenge. Perhaps there will be a ""Baby Boomer"" version in the future. Guess I'll pass for now."
1,Very Dissapointed!,"My huband bought me a Kindle as a gift in December. I used it several times and it worked quite well. Then, I got busy and didn't really have time to read for pleasure. Today, the day before we are going to Mexico on 7 day vacation, I attempted to charge it so I could order some books and use it while away. It was dead! I called customer service and they said that they would send me a new one--however, it would not arrive until we were already on vacation. I asked them to send it to our resort in Mexico and apparently that cannot be done either. My husband bought it so I could use a large font and read easily. Sadly, now I won't have it for the duration of our vacation. I would think Amazon could do better than this..."
3,Kindle for Kindle,"When I first heard about the Kindle, I knew that I wanted one. I asked for one for Christmas -- but was given the Sony eReader. Needless to say I was disappointed...I thought that I'd ask Amazon to give discounts to all people named Kindle. Well that didn't work, so I'm dealing with the Sony.A couple of weeks ago, I was traveling to DFW. My seatmate had never heard of eReaders, and was thoroughly impressed with the Sony. As a matter of fact, he was so impressed that he and his business associate purchased the Sony eReader.The moral of the story....if Kindle had received a Kindle -- I could have sold some Kindles. :-) Yes, it's a blatant attempt to get a Kindle --- and donate my Sony eReader. Are you listening AMAZON?"
4,"GOOD for text only books, BAD for technical books and UGLY for non English books",GOOD for text only books.BAD for technical books.UGLY for non English books.I don't regret buying it but I wish the international customers could purchase Kindle DX.
2,No good for Europe,"Kindle is a wonderful device, but is quite frustrating when you try to buy some of the already limited number of books edited in this format, and you received the message that this title can not be delivered in your area (Europe!!).If you only want to read the last bestseller or the classics, then everything is ok, but if not, probably you will have to continue shopping the paper versions."
5,sweetpea,"I Love the Amazon Kindle. Very easy to use,easy to see. Easy to download books or mags. Great for traveling. Don't have to go to a book store. Saves alot of time. I very strongly recommend this product. Contradulation's Amazon on a great product!!!!!!!"
5,Love My Kindle!,"I really thought I would hate the Kindle. I love books. The feel of a book in my hands, the smell, the artwork, paper, everything. I purchase books all the time. A friend got a Kindle and I was curious. I did my research asked lots of questions before deciding to buy it. I take it everywhere. Its great to have something so light weight and easy to use. Getting a book in a matter of seconds anytime I want it is nothing short of amazing. I'm not saying I won't still buy books. Some books are meant to have. Having a Kindle is awesome, I love it.Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)"
4,My Kindle 2,"I just got my new Kindle 2, after researching and comparing, and overall deciding to go with the Kindle 2. I love the screen, it doesn't reflect anything, no matter where I sit.The only thing I have a problem with is the text-to-speech, its very ""grainy"" sounding. And it doesn't read the book, it only reads the words, so you don't really know where one sentence ends and another starts. Which also means that dialog is hard to follow. Its also very umm... mechanical? Which, if you don't plan on listening to it a whole lot wouldn't be a problem, but i have to use text-to-speech 50% of the time, so i have to figure out how to fix this.Even with the text-to-speech issue, I LOVE my new Kindle 2. Its really portable and with it being so small, I can take it anywhere. Its perfect for me, and I would definatly reccomend this product to all my friends."
5,Love Kindle 2,"I bought my kindle in April and now the price has been reduced drastically. A little upset about that... However, I love my kindle 2 and I use it all the time."
2,Too many Books not available in UK,"Before you buy this product and you live in the UK, make sure you signin on your account from amazon.co.uk and then check the books that are available.ALL of the 20 or so books I wanted to buy from the Fantasy section were not available for UK readers due to copyright issues.ALL of these books are available in the UK for the Sony Ereader, which does not have the number of books that the Kindle has, but at least in the UK they are more up to date and books you might actually want to read.The device itself has a sold feel and the 3G access is average but works reasonably quickly. The one book I did buy to actually read some thing, was well formatted and easy to read on the screen, even under glaring lights.BUT until the Kindle book store caters for UK residents properly, I would not recommend this expensive paper weight to anyone in the UK."
3,not for rural areas,"I'm disappointed that a week after I bought this item, the price went down significantly. Not to mention that you cannot get wireless delivery with the provider you carry in my area that other wireless providers do cover. I would have to drive at least 30 miles to get the wireless benefit, and I live in upstate New York. As far as the product goes I really like how it works. It is very easy to read, everything that is described in the product summary, is absolutely accurate. Would only reccomend this product in big city areas to get the full benefit of this product."
5,Improving Kindle reader for low vision readers,"I have used the Kindle reader for about one month and I find it a wonderful product. Because I have low vision I would like to see some modifications in the reader. It would be easier to read the text if the reader were back-lit I know that would increase the price and battery strength, but for low vision readers, it would worth it."
3,Book downloads only as good as your Sprint signal,"Although I love my kindle, it is frustrating that I can""t download any purchases from my home as the Sprint signal is too weak. Amazon needs to use a company with better signal coverage. Because of this, I can't get magazines or newspaper downloads on a timely basis. For book downloads, I need to drive to an area that has a stronger signal which is very annoying."
4,Kindle love,"Got the Kindle for Christmas! It has been awesome to read with. I particularly like the ability to download and read samples of books I am interested in!One downside to the Kindle is the lack of features that are available for pdfs. If you're looking to used the Kindle to read many pdfs, you are not able to zoom, meaning the printing is pretty small. Rotating the page does increase the size of font but is not as convienient to use.Other than the lack of pdf features, the Kindle is well worth ordering."
3,Extensive Library?,"Just got the Kindle for Christmas, so really can't review it properly yet, but I was surprised to see that the first two books I looked up (The Godfather of Poker-The Doyle Burnson Story, and Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas) are not on Kindle. I just hope this is not a sign of things to come."
3,Great but..,"Great product, but the book selection is very limited...This is great if you like to read the ""new in paperback"" section, but not much else."
4,New Kindle owner,"I'm a new user. So far I like it and I'm enthused with all the features. I looked at the Sony reader and was not impressed with what it had to offer. I would recommend they put an optional back light on the kindle so, if the need arises, it could be read in an area that was not well lit."
4,kindle wireless reading device,"I haven't used the kindle before, but I had this idea at church awhile back before I heard of the kindle. I thought someone should invent a screen that people can hold in church with the songs that people are singing in church and the bulletin of the day. That way we could eliminate heavy hymnbooks and the use of alot of paper. Does the kindle do this?"
2,Kindle fell from holder..................,I love my Kindle!!!!! However.....The case/ cover of my Gen 1 Kindle has never held the book safely and now after 18 months it finally fell out one too many times. The book hit the ground and the screen went out. Just shows lines and after resetting and restarting I feel it is toast. I am disappointed in the original cover design and and myself for tempting fate too often. 359.00 bucks well spent until now. Is the new case any better at holding the book in place? I won't spend 300.00 to find out.
3,kindle review,Kindle is perfect if all you want to is read books!! If you are buying it for any of it's other features you will be disappointed. Battery lasts a long time if you keep the wireless shut off. Great book selection!!
5,My New Kindle,I am well pleased with my new Kindle Reader. Now that I have my burgundy cover it feels much more like a real book and is easier held and read. Ease of adding books is a huge plus and the battery holds its charge for several days of use.
5,Love my Kindle!,"If you haven't tried the 6"" Display Kindle Wireless Global, Latest Generation Reading Device, you don't know what you are missing. It is smaller than a paperback to carry in your purse wherever you go. I love having the ability to enlarge the print as I really need this feature. Also, the lightness in weight of the device itself is another reason I bought the 6"" over the larger unit. It is so much easier to hold. The screen lighting is perfect in both daylight and nightlight. Although, I did buy a clip on light for my night time reading. It goes with me wherever I go and everyone asks me what it is, and of course I sing its praises! I received mine as a Christmas present. It came charged and ready to go. I have already read 4 books from it and have ordered three more. It is easy to order your books online and they are right there on your device in a few seconds. It is so convenient. You don't have to run out to be bookstore anymore! Order it and you will love it, too!"
5,I love It,It's great. I take it everywhere so I am never bored anymore. Connects to the internet quickly. Very easy to use and lots of fun.
2,KIndle- Kindle Edition Vs soft cover price not that different,I have had my Kindle for a while and I enjoy it and like having the NYT sent with out the ads. I have noticed lately that the difference in price between the Kindle Edition and the hard copy have become miniscule. I was looking for a book to improve my putting and the price difference between the Kindle edition and the new soft cover sent to my house in two days (which I could then pass around or sell) was eighteen cents. Just doesn't seem right.5/17/10 It seems the blush has come off this rose. I have previously recommended the kindle to friends and colleagues. As I mentioned earlier I liked to read the NYT on the Kindle. The $13.99 subscription just went up 43% to 19.99 a month. Seems like this good idea is starting to become a bait and switch.
4,na,"The product works as advertised. It is a big step forward with the wireless, over my edition one Kindle which will not pick up wireless in my area (mid-Wyoming). The down side from the first edition is the lack of sd card function which I make great use of with version one. Otherwise it has a clear crisp screen, syncs wirelessly and is very comfortable to hold."
5,Awesome!,"I got this from my dad on my birthday. I have been enjoying it for 9 months. I love have there are so many cheap or free books my tiny allowance can afford. I love the fast internet and how the kindle feels great in your hand. I would recommend buying the leather cover for protection though. There are so many books in the store. If you want free books, find a pre 1923 book or just search ""free"". The built-in dictionary is cool, and I use it when playing Scrabble. I like paperbacks, but I take the kindle most places with me. For vision-impaired customer, I would buy the DX(see link). The kindle is a wonderful gadget and I haven't run into ANY problems with it.Kindle DX Wireless Reading Device (9.7"" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)"
4,Recommendations for next generation Kindle,I hope the next generation Kindle keeps the page turner on both sides of the device so you can control it with both hands with no trouble. Also...make the screen background lighter instead of a mid tone grey. Hopefully the screen itself will get 10% wider and 10% longer. And one more...don't try to compete with the ipad. Just make it a light weight compact reading device for people who like to read.
1,Crippled by DRM,"This should be a fantastic product, but is totally ruined by the addition of DRM. You do not own the books that you keep on this device, you are merely permitted to read them at the pleasure of the publisher and Amazon. If they decide you may no longer read the book, they can (and will) take it away from you without your consent. And they have so many other deeply unpleasant properties that I can't be bothered to list. Deeply immoral. How can such an advance in technology be so astonishingly inferior to a paperback? Don't buy one, they suck."
1,Amazon fails to mention what their DRM system can do,"Amazon refuses to clarify what exactly their DRM system can do, or how they will or won't use it. Deceptive advertising practices like this are currently being looked into by the Federal Trade Commission. Notice that there is no mention or warning of DRM on the Kindle page."
1,Never Ever,"I will never get a Kindle unless they change one thing. You own the content you purchase. Either that, or a small monthly fee to access a wide range of content. Either solution is fine, but I'm not ""leasing"" their book when I could buy a copy and have it as long as I want."
1,NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AFTER 1 YEAR,I HAVE A KINDLE THAT I BOUGHT 1 YEAR AND 21 DAYS AGO. I ALSO HAVE LOTS OF BOOKS THAT I BOUGHT THAT I HAVEN'T YET READ. THE KINDLE DIED AND THE KINDLE REPRESENTATIVE OFFERED ME A REBUILT KINDLE FOR $180. NOW I AM OUT THE $400 I PAID AND ALL THE MONEY THAT I SPENT ON BOOKS FOR THE KINDLE. BE CAREFUL BEFORE BUYING THIS PRODUCT AS THERE IS NO SUPPORT.
4,Almost perfect,"I've got it for my wife who is an addicted reader. It's almost perfect. The contrast, as many reviewers mentioned, can be a problem for sensitive people but she is happy. Interface still needs some improvement - for example pausing the reader should be more simple. Other than that it's a cool thing. It's light, convenient, it can read text, play mp3's and audio books (she already had plenty of them), you can download your pdf's, buying new books is very simple. The speaker volume and reading quality are good, battery life is more than adequate. Leather cover and a clip-on light are highly recommended."
5,The Apple of my eye,"I own a Kindle 1. From day one I thought"" the concept is great, the device is the limitation. If only they had asked Apple to design and build the device"". Well 90% of the fixes are in the new version. The 3g connection works flawlessly. The text to speech engine is great for road trips. The new power source is small and allows powering from the USB of my Mac. The text is easy to read. The buttons click in the correct direction. The device feels like it is worth the price. That may seem like a small thing but the machine itself feels like it is of high quality. If they added the click wheel navigation all of my concerns would be fixed. If they really are going to add browsing capabilities they'd better put the WiFi back as well as the 3G."
3,kindle,Like the convenience and speed of downloading books. The dictionary feature for looking up definitions is a handy feature. Don't like the fact that the battery life is limited (not good for east to west coast flights) and that the background can't be lite for ease of reading in low light (although I recognize this would use up the already limited battery life quicker)
3,I like it but irritated at Amazon,"This was our third Kindle; the first was inadvertently damaged, so the wife got a new one, I opted for a refurbished model because the cost of two new ones was daunting. The re-furb arrived and looked brand new and worked beautifully... for two weeks and the battery has diminished ever since. I now get about an hours use out of each recharge. Two letters to Kindle support have gone unanswered, I am out of the country so I cannot call in to gripe. I understand that the re-furb models are ""sold as-is"", but I'd hope that Amazon would be decent to a repeat customer (who's wife has spent over a thousand $ on books) and replace a battery that started failing immediately after purchase. It's not too late Amazon - do you read these reviews?"
1,kindle has no staying power - and the web site stinks,"I got my Kindle for Christmas 2009. I quite liked it at first - but - it has dropped the last 3 books in the middle of my reading them - suddenly says go to beginning - and who wants to do 500 clicks to get to 67% of the book?? Not me. And I have tried to ""contact Us"" to get a new one...but lo and behold can't find it anywhere Finally last complaint - new issue books aren't available - why are they not negotiating Kindle rights at the same time as things are published? My recommendation: go to your local book store. I won't be using my kindle again -call it the Betamax of book readers!!"
1,?????,"I did like the reader when it worked. Did not even last a year and the battery would mot charge, no place to e-mail with this problem. So I am out $300.00. TAmazon Kindle Buyer's Guide: Is the AmazonKindle Digital Wireless eBook Reader for You? (includes cover device kindel 1 new 2) (> same as the free report at [...] <)his also happen to my son and it land up buying a dirrent reader which he is very happy with."
3,I LOVE IT... BUT...,"I bought my Kindle two weeks ago, so far I love the product and I love to be able to buy the books online. But I am dissappointed about the price. A day after I bought my first book I noticed the Kindle suddenly dropped its price $70. I waited many months to afford one and it makes me upset that I could have waited two more weeks to buy it. So unfair."
2,Love the kindle but .....,"I like my new kindle that i just got a little over a WEEK ago, however, I bought the kindle for $259.00 and the price now went down to only $189.00 since then! If i knew it would have gone that much down in price i would have waited a week longer until i bought one! >:["
3,I want more,"I like the instant gratification that my Kindle DX provides. I read a review in the Sunday NY Times Book Review and can download the book instantly. But as I read about new e-readers and tablets that will be coming to the market soon, I feel the Kindle could quickly become a legacy system. I'd like a real Web browser with fast networking; dual technology screen that supports color; I want to see the graphics in magazines; I want to book cover art in color; I want to be able to add apps just like my smartphone."
2,Why I don't / can't own one ...,"Until Kindle can do true color photographs, it will not be able to meet my needs. Among other issues, I am a birder and need decent photographs in many of the items I read. I suppose you can get color in the software versions for PCs, but I run Linux for a variety of reasons - and they don't have a version for Linux.There's no feedback directly to Amazon about this product, at least that I can find, so I'm posting it here. Obviously this is a review of the Kindle by someone who's never touched one. However, if they round out their offerings to cover the gaps I mentioned, then I'll reconsider seriously. My one concern then would be - what do I do with my investment in Kindle books if that product is ever dropped? (As it someday will be.) Real books don't have any compatibility issues over time, generations even. Kindle books ... ?Two stars for a great technological idea. Three missing due to the failure to complete the implementation."
1,Rip-off! Book prices jacked up over 50% right after major promotion,My decision to buy a Kindle was based largely on a calculation of the cost of paperbacks versus Kindle books. There is something incredibly sleazy about jacking the prices of books up over 50% right after a massive promotional campaign. Why should I trust a company that would do that in the future.
3,Needs major improvements/wait for Apple Ebook,"Returning the kindle for the following reasonsPages black out when turning a pageNo contrast adjustmentPage is not white with black type, it is gray with almost black typeI hate hearing a click turning the pageThe web interface is clunkyThe toggle seems a dated technologyI get as much content on my iphone than I do on the kindle screenI love the kindle on my iphone ....a perfect interfac and will stick with that, plusI can turn the pages with a swipe of my finger,I can adjustment the contrast of the screen.sad about the return..had high hopes for this."
5,"Thanks, Amazon","Even though there are hundreds of reviews about the Kindle 2, I wanted to add my own two cents. I have wanted an ebook for more than 15 years, but I never found the right match for me until now. There are too many cool features on it to describe them all, so I'll just say, ""Thanks, Amazon, for making exactly what I wanted."" The dictionary is great; I don't need it often, but it hardly interrupts being carried away in the plot to look up that pesky, errant word which occasionally befuddles me. I look forward to many, many more books being added to the list of offerings. As I can afford them, I will be purchasing my old favorites on Kindle and passing my cherished tomes on for others to enjoy. I can't say enough about it. I love it! I love it! I love it!!!"
4,Very Happy with my Purchase,"Kindle 2 was my first e-book reader although I have been researching both Sony and Kindle for some time. I am very satisfied with my purchase and I take it everywhere I go.I was concerned about the small screen size before the purchase. Turns out it is really not an issue for most books. Pretty soon, you forget that you are reading it on a kindle and get immersed in the content.What would I like to see improved? There are a few things:- Larger screen would be useful for Large format content like Magazines- Native PDF Support- More Books! Most of the technical books (Software, Internet) are not yet available on the kindle"
5,I love my Kindle 2,"This is the first time I have ever tried an e-reader of any kind. I just love the Kindle 2. It is so easy to use! I am a user of bifocal lenses, so it is nice to be able to adjust the font size to fit my vision with or without glasses.Downloading a book is quite fast and simple. I am very grateful to not have to go to a store for my reading material. This is a great bonus!I bought the leather cover for 29.99. It is very sturdy and protects the Kindle 2 well. It is definitely a must have.I also got the protective skin for the back of the Kindle 2 and the screen saver. I want my Kindle 2 to last forever!Reading with the Kindle 2 is a pure joy! The page turning is quite fast. I have found the book selections to be more than adequate for my reading preferences.It is such a ease to take the Kindle 2 anywhere. It can slip into a purse or a tote easily.I highly recommend it to anyone who is into reading. You will not regret this purchase!"
5,Amazing!,"I got this as a Christmas gift this year and absolutely love it! It is so easy to use and handle, especially with a cover, that I'm not sure I'll ever be able to go back to regular books. I can sip my coffee with one hand while changing the page with the other. I use a slightly larger size font and readability is superb. I've ordered the attachable light, but have no problem seeing the screen. Purchased (and free) books download in seconds -- I'm never without reading material. And it's so small and lightweight, I don't even know it's in my purse. I was straddling the fence as to whether or not I wanted to try this, but now that I have, I'm thrilled. Great job, Amazon!"
4,beware,"I bought this a few weeks ago, my wife tried using it. Needless to say my time on the device is non-existent, and the attention my wife pays to me had dramatically dropped. Its a wonderful gift, best get 2."
4,Reading by Kindle,I love my kindle. I've had it for a week and a half and find myself carrying it everywhere I go. I've read 2 books already and several samples.
4,Kindle,At the time I purchased it this was set of the art. I loved using it but found that the battery life was disappointing. Extra chargers to carry around we're annoying. Now use my iPad.
3,Could be so much better.,"Easy to read and operate. Everything I expected 20 years ago when I thought newspapers were a huge waste and should be replaced with something electronic with downloadable data instead of destroying forests (that was before the intenet and widespread use of wireless). Just one problem; Amazon are greedy; they want too much from the Australian newspaper publishers (60-70%, depending on who you believe). So I just read books instead. Very disappointing."
4,Great device,"I think that Kindle is very useful to practice English for European people,of course.I would prefer to have more magazines to choose. In particular the Economist or other European magazines."
1,Doesn't Come With a Case,"I purchased an original Kindle which arrived with a very poorly designed case, but at least it had a case. I've now purchased two other units as gifts. I had the second unit (a Kindle 2)sent directly to the recipient and didn't see how it arrived to realize that it didn't come with any case at all. I've now purchased a 3rd unit and have learned that Amazon, somewhere along the line, decided to eliminate the case to increase their profits. Much like the airline industry that now charges to check your first bag when traveling, Amazon had decided to charge separately for a necessary component of a product that everyone expects to be part of the purchase price when ordering. It will be the last Kindle I purchase, and depending on whether I get over the anger of being cheated by a company I trusted, may be my last purchase of anything from Amazon. Add $30 to $50 dollars to the price before deciding to purchase a Kindle. You will not want one without a case."
1,Kindle & DRM,"As both an Amazon customer and member of the Free Software Foundation I ask you to please consider the FSF suggestion to drop the use of DRM from this device as well as building an eReader solution around free software. Amazon.com as a company is a great success story. However, in fullness of honesty could Amazon have even been possible, if it were not for the free exchange of information the pioneers of the Internet so valued and enabled? According [...] www.amazon.com is hosted using GNU/Linux. Supporting the ideals of the community that supports your business is not only the right thing to do morally and ethically, it is also good business.Yours sincerely,Randy Galbraith"
3,So So,"I own both the Kindle 2 and Sony's Digital Reader PRS-505, the only advantage I see with the Kindle 2 is the better resolution and the abilty to get books quick. However Sony's version is much better, it's more durable, built better, not as fragile and not as thin as the kindle."
1,WOW,"This is my first e-reader. I love it. I love it. I love it. The lightness, easy on the eyes screen, easy download, button positions, dictionary, bookmarks, etc...... I have no complaints!!!!!"
5,Love It,I love it. It is great not to have to carry several books. It is easy on the eyes and easy to use. I wish there were even more books that were kindled.It would be nice if the page back was opposite the page forward but a minor thing really. I have had no difficulty whisperneting the books to the kindle except for once and I just downloaded to the computer and moved it to the kindle.I especially appreciate the variable font size. If lighting is bad or I am tired I move to a larger font for easier reading.I would recommend it to anyone.
4,Audio,"Very nice machine. Would prefer power plug on side, small nit. Do I get a partial refund if Amazon restricts audio?"
1,They can take what's yours.,"I love the idea of the Kindle, and have been waiting a long time for the production of an e-reader so that I could carry my whole library around. However, since the events with the Orwell books being unlawfully removed from their owners' Kindles, I will not be purchasing this device until clearer laws have been established."
1,Amazon deletes your content at will!,Beware of the Big Brother! Amazon deleted Big Brother books from everyone who already paid for it and purchased it from Amazon without any input from the owners of Kindle.
2,So disappointed - dark gray screen display,"Finally having ordered a Kindle I am floored at how bad the display contrast is - the 'paper' background of my particular kindle is several shades grayer than in the advertising pictures. What is up with that??? I spent a good hour trying to figure out how to adjust contrast. When I couldn't find it in settings or the manual, I finally googled it and found out there is no contrast adjustment! I couldn't believe it. I am finding it difficult to read the black type on medium gray, and I also find it ugly. Is my particular Kindle display particularly bad, or are they all so gray? Kindle developers, what on earth are you thinking? I am looking for a book-like experience, not a dirty looking, hard to read, ugly so-so gadget. Anyhow, I am thinking of returning this one and buying a later model when and if they fix the contrast/ background. I am so very disappointed."
3,product in development,"Reading books from the Kindle store is satisfying. The screen is allright and the device as a whole is easy to handle. Buying books from the Kindlestore is easy as well, although not cheap.However, Texts that I downloaded with my laptop from Googlebooks en put over via USB to the Kindle can hardly be read, because the characters are to small and you cannot change that on the Kindle device.The (experimental) MP3-feature does not work at all."
2,Beware of Amazon,"My friend lost her Kindle and found out the ""new owner"" was already downloading books for their new find. We called Amazon and they would not help identify the new owner though they probably knew who it was. All they would do is shut the unit down. It's quite a bummer that they won't assist in retrieving the lost Kindle. I assumed they would assist which they will not!"
3,"Nice, but not if you have big fingers","In general, I like the Kindle 2. I bought it for my mom so she could utilize the large font option and expand her potential reading material. But the small joystick button that navigates as well as selects is too small and she can't use it consistently. Even for the nimble, it takes a gentle touch to get it to do what you want. Unfortunately, the larger Kindle DX uses the same controller, so I'll be looking for a different platform next time around."
5,Absolutely the best!,"I wasn't sure if I was going to like reading from an electronic device, I like the look and feel of an actual book. I received the Kindle as a Christmas gift from my husband and I have never looked back. It is so easy to read, no glare and I don't have to pack multiple books when traveling. I can't say enough as to how much I love it. I do use the leather cover as I carry it in my purse and take it just about everywhere."
4,Best Christmas present I got!!,"I love that I can carry this in my purse so I have it to read during down time at doctors offices, or waiting for anything. I am reluctant to carry a book every where, but this is perfect. I like that if I finish a book and still have down time I can just buy another book from my Kindle and continue to be productive. The selection of books is good and they are a great savings from the hard back books I used to puchase. But, I find it hard to justify purchasing many books this way, as I usually share books with family members and now I can't do that, somekind of sharing program needs to be implemented like the Nook has. In fact if I could share books it would prompt me to purchase Kindles for some of my family members, so that we could share books, but we don't each want to have to purchase the same books."
4,Kindle,"I absolutely love my Kindle. It's an easy way to go green. It allows me to carry a book (or books), a magazine, a newspaper in one light weight devise. My purse weighs so much less and my back thanks the kindle. I recommend it to everyone."
4,Kindle2 The beginning....or the end,"I have had my kindle2 for a little over 2 months now in that time I have not bought one paper book, I have only been to the library once to do some research. I find the kindle2 a very useful, extremely easy to use tool. Everything is very straight forward from reading to downloading. I find myself wondering though, will the e-reader eventually take over the the new and used book stores? perhaps even the library? some of my most favorite places to be.Phil"
5,Love my Kindle,Enoy the kindle very much---very convenient- love that a book is transfered within a minute and I haven't left my chair.
3,Won't replace the written word,"The Kindle 2 is small, slim, & compact. It feels good in the palm but it won't replace the feel of a real book.The extensive library can be downloaded in an actual minute; most books are $9.99 or cheaper. The type can be adjusted for any eye.But, a book has a ceretain gravitas; each page turned is part of the reading experience. The Kindle 2 turns pages well but because of the size of the page, some paragraphs are cut off.All in all, it can save the clutter of stacking books on your coffee table but will not replace the feel and experience of a real book"
1,Quickly becoming finanically non-viable,"Got my Kindle about 2 years ago. Back then new releases were being offered at $9.99. They are now $12.99 - a 30% increase! I love the fact that I can carry a book in my briefcase at less than half the size but it's becoming more expensive to do so and not worth the savings on weight. Here's an example: I wanted to read Dean Koontz's new book - $12.99 + tax on my Kindle. I went to Sam's Club and paid $14.99 + tax, read the book and sold it on Amazon for $10.50 + shipping. Bottom line - reading the hardcover edition cost me around $5.90. If the person who bought my book reads it and turns around and sells it for $5.00 then that person GIVES it to someone else and on and on . . . .It might make a difference if I could share books I bought with other people. I'm back to buying books the old fashioned way!"
1,Nice looking but not functional,"The device looks very nice but say if you are planning to read pdfs do not buy Kindle. One column pdfs could be read with a powerful lens but two columns are impossible to read. If you insist on buying it, just read the book format created for kindle. There are many books for USA but not for Europe. Also the shipment is like 70$ to Europe and if you don't like it (or if you want to send it back because it was delivered broken) you still need to pay the shipment yourself. This is of course not a disadvantage of Kindle but Amazon return policy."
2,Might as well buy actual books now!,Now that Amazon has raised Kindle prices for books it seems that I may just buy actual books rather the Kindle type. The savings offered with my first Kindle account were good but now very poor. I haven't purchased a Kindle book in many weeks but have purchased several actual books lately.With the IPad and other products coming I would not buy a Kindle but wait to see what works best.
1,International fees are a ripoff,"We purchased a new Kindle for our daughter, who is living abroad, specifically because of the advertised ability for international users to download content wirelessly. When Amazon ballyhooed the international features of the new Kindle, we immediately purchased one as a gift for her. Instead of a great gift, we unintentionally saddled her with download fees every time she buys a book or wants to read a newspaper. In the fine print, Amazon tells you about all these extra charges, which can amount to hundreds of extra dollars a year for someone living abroad who is an avid reader. So, we wasted our money buying the new global Kindle because she has had to revert to using the cumbersome USB method of downloading. Amazon should make the extra fees crystal clear to potential buyers. Instead, the marketing for this product says no fees for downloading, and then they hide the fees for international users in the fine print. We couldn't be more disappointed with this product."
4,Great!,"I absolutely LOVE my kindle, but it would great to be able to share books or rent books for a period of time like the Barnes and Noble Nook does."
5,Awesome!,"Well, I received it for Christmas. I gave it some time, read almost 14 book on it already. Feel I have used it enough to give an honest, experienced review.I love it. It is easy to take with me everywhere. I can enlarge the text. If I go into another book, like my recipe book I downloaded, my place is saved when I go back.Some have said they with it lit up, but I disagree. I have never had a book 'light' up from within and so am used to this. The reading plane looks like a book page. I would find it lighting up a nuisance. I live in an out of the way town, and have had no problems receiving or browsing item from the Kindle store on my Kindle.I do like some 'racy' books and it is nice to be able to sit and not worry about people looking at the cover of my book. I bought my mother a Kindle and she loves hers also."
5,Great Product,"I think this product is GREAT. I am an avid reader that travels every other week. I used to buy several books a month and lug them around with me from airport to airport. Now that I have the Kindle 2, I can just download any book that looks interesting on the spot for $9.99. I was considering giving it 4 stars for it's web browser, but then thought, I bought this for one reason, to read books. I am one that likes to separate my electronics. For instance, I do not have an iPhone due to the fact that if my phone goes bad, I need a new ipod as well. So I would rather a reader just be a reader.The EVDO wireless on this is very fast and download times, even for large books, is in the seconds. I think the only way it could be improved is by having a stylus to underline and take notes rather than the keyboard."
1,Sorry I got into eBooks,"Since I'm new to eBooks I thought Kindle would save me money. First edition hard cover books (discounted) run about $15.00 or $16.00. With eBooks at Kindle they were running $9.99 this past fall when I purchased my Kindle. NOW first edition hard cover books on Kindle are running between $13.00 and $15.00 so any savings using a Kindle are now gone. Additionally many book publishers are not supporting eBooks with a new release which could take up to 90 days before you can get it on Kindle (i.e. James Patterson, plus others) and then you still will pay about the same price if you just ordered the hard cover book when it was first released. I think my Kindle will be available on Amazon very soon for a discounted price.John QuinnSorry I bought a Kindle"
2,DISAPPOINTED - NEW Releases NOT available,"I have a kindle 2. I have had it about 6 months and have absolutely loved it. Although right now, I am greatly disappointed with the availability of new releases. Rumor has it that there is some kind of fighting going on between Amazon and the publishers - although Amazon has yet to say anything about it. All I know is the books that I want, that just released, are not available in the kindle format... yet they ARE available in the Barnes and Noble's Nook format.The kindle itself is awesome. I could go on and on about the kindle, and all the cool things I like about it. But not being able to get the books you want to get... well, that is a problem. It almost makes me wish that I bought the Nook instead! And that just makes me sad...."
2,Content Issues,"I bought this 2 weeks ago, I was so excited to get it, and so excited to begin using it! I pored over ""samples"" and looked at tons of different content and downloaded some free, and kept thinking about a particular book, ""Wolf Hall"" and finally decided to purchase it after reading a sample. I had seen it for sale on the Kindle for 8.80. When I went to purchase it last night, it was gone. Seems that Amazon is in a dispute with publishers, and that a LOT of previously available content is gone.Heres the thing, Im in this to be able to read what I want, when I want, not be in the middle of Amazons fights with Publishers. Sorry Amazon, I love you, but this has been a seriously lousy user experience . This device is getting returned."
2,too vulnerable,"I first purchased a kindle in May 2011 for a year of teaching abroad. Having steady access to electronic books was a lifesaver, and I never went anywhere without it. However it has a fatal flaw: a complete lack of durability. in one year in Thailand and traveling, I broke three kindles; each time, Amazon sent a replacement, and a family member who happened to be visiting brought it along. I finally just broke my fourth kindle, and am out of warranty.I may be especially hard on my kindle- travel tends to be difficult- but travel is precisely when I need it. My macbook has lasted 6 years, my iphone has lasted roughly 4 times my average kindle's lifespan,and now, I am going to have to purchase something more durable. this product was a huge disappointment because its promise was so great, because it's so laughably fragile."
3,Ok,"This was purchased when Kindle just came out. My husband works so hard that he hardly finds time to read a book, so it hasn't gotten much use, but it was a good buy back then...."
5,Must Have!,"This should be on everyone's ""must have"" list if you do any reading at all. Absolutely LOVE IT! I read twice as much now as I did before and the books seem to go so much faster on the Kindle. It is convenient anywhere, anytime and wonderful for travel. Pencil it in on your Christmas list if you haven't already."
5,Love My Kindle,"I am absolutely thrilled that I decided to buy the Kindle. I very rarely by myself anything of this caliber but after hearing a few of my friends rave about their Kindles and seeing the different things it does I knew I had to do it. I am amazed at the clarity in the reading and how much faster I am reading. It seems to take me no time to get through 500 pages, and I always read every word. I find it so much fun to read on the Kindle. I chose a great book cover and feel just like I am reading a regular book that is also very sleek and high-tech. I manage to make time for myself to do this every day because I miss it when I don't. This was a fabulous invention. I don't want to read books any other way and on the rare occasion that I can't find a book there I will find something else."
1,Do NOT BUY if you Live in PUERTO RICO,They will not let you buy books unless you have a Continental U.S. Addressyou will not be able to buy books. This is awful. I hate Amazon.
1,Proprietary wireless is a step in the wrong direction,"Amazon says ""you never have to hunt for a wireless connection"".. provided you're in Sprint's network area. If you're not, you're SOL. One of my family brought their Kindle up to my place where Sprint service doesn't work but most other major providers do. I have 802.11 wireless connectivity available but the Kindle uses a private network for its wireless communication. In this modern age, to not include standard WiFi access is a total deal-breaker. And the new Kindle DX suffers from the same problem. I hear Sony's product doesn't have these deficiencies. I would not recommend a product that is crippled and employs proprietary technology - it was obsolete the day it was released."
3,Big Step Backwards for the Kindle,"I bought the original a month ago on ebay as they weren't available from amazon any longer and thought I had died and gone to heaven. On the original, I thought the designers could have put the power and wireless buttons on the front of the device for ease of use. I correctly assumed that would be corrected with the new version. Although Kindle 2 is smaller, thinner, etc., the ""next page"" button which is the most frequently used is now a third of the size of the original and requires effort to activate whereas the old one had two huge buttons to advance the text which required almost no effort and could be found without even looking because they were so big. Also Kindle 2 doesn't come with a leather folio (which was included with the original) so you have to buy one which . In short, had I physically seen the new version, I would have surely waited for Kindle 3."
2,whispernet-silentnet,"Could not register Kindle from my home, despite being in the good area on the amazon coverage map. Upon calling help line, they explain that ATT is the service they use. Interesting, that Amazon map says there is coverage here when ATT does not sell a cellphone plan in the area. Wonder whose is kidding who? Also quite upset that I bought the kindle within 1 week of price war. guess I should have sent it back and just ordered another one or maybe gotten an ipad which at least has wifi connectivity unlike the kindle."
4,i like it,Its very easy to use and I seem to do more reading with this device. Its very easy to order a book and I like that I can change the size of the letters. I just wish that it had a back light and also color on the pictures and stuff would be nice. It will probably be there in future ones. Overall I am happy with it.
5,Absolutely the best!,"I had been considering buying a Kindle since the first version came out, but decided to wait until the ""bugs"" were worked out. I'm glad I waited even longer since the price also came down. I'm an avid reader and have collected a lot of books over the years. I would usually wait for a book to come out in paperback before purchasing, and would then try to find it at a discount store -- my point being that in terms of cost, the Kindle version seems to be about the same. BUT, I can now buy a book sooner, AND I'm not accumulating all those print version books that I have no place to store. Good for me and good for the environment!The Kindle is the perfect size for holding and reading. Downloading books is a snap, and I love the dictionary feature. I really have no complaints."
5,kindle review,"hi have my kindle now for a month as soon as it was avilable for australia i order it only took about a week to get here, and cant say enough about it. I have rave about it to every body that i know a few of my freinds and family are going to purchased them as christmas gifts . The kindle is so easy to use. I read a lot and it was costing alot now i get them a lot cheaper and within 1 min i can start reading without going to a book store . Thanks Amazon it was a great buy ivana Australia"
5,unbelievable,"While I wish I had researched this purchase first to find out about the newest version coming out at the end of August 2010, I absolutely love my Kindle and don't know how I ever managed without it. I love to read and love printed books. But I have a physical disability that makes it hard for me to manage holding big books for long amounts of time. The Kindle has improved my life so much in this way. Now I read any time I want!"
5,I Love My Kindle!!,"I've had my Kindle for a year now and just love it. Traveling is great; now I only have to download all my books to one medium and have a variety to travel with, much easier!"
5,My Christmas present,"I received my Kindle for Christmas.My husband and I are missionaries in Guatemala.I used to bring books back with me in our suitcases,but due to the recent changes of the airlines pertaining to luggage weight,I had to stop bringing them.This Kindle is perfect for my reading needs!I couldn't be happier."

5,Amazing!,"I am loving the Kindle. Have wanted one for a while now and wished that I had pulled the trigger to purchase one back when I first saw it so that all the books I have bought lately were in digital and not cluttering up my house. I also feel like I am doing my part to go green. I was first worried that the digital library did not cover all the books I wanted, but while it does not cover them all (yet, I am sure), I do feel like there is more than plenty of material to keep me busy. I love the device so much that I am avoiding books in paperback and will just wait for those to come out on the kindle. The battery is great. The device is light and very portable. Could not have made a better purchase this summer."
5,Best Thing Ever!,I am a very busy person but love books and learning! I never get to sit down anymore and just read like I use to. I always considered books as my friend. Now I can just turn on the audio feature and let it read to me. It even turns the pages and keeps up with where I left off. This has made my life so much easier and I have my friends back!
5,Gift from the gods,"The kindle is a device that Leonardo Da Vinci would be proud to have called his own. It is elegant, it is artistic, it is functional. It is clearly superior to the classic ""book"" or ""newspaper."" There is no doubt in my mind that it will become a device owned by just about everyone--like the t.v. or cell phone. This is just the beginning"
2,No service in Canada?,"So the kindle service is offered in the Falkland Islands but not in Canada, makes no sense to me."
4,Merianne's Review,"I am enjoying my new Kindle alot, but was sure bummed out to find that 4 weeks after I purchased mine you lowered the price.Two suggestions I would have are some way to light up the screen without having to put a separate light on it.Also, would it be possible to place the plug in on one of the sides. I often read with mine plugged in to save the battery and with the plug being on the bottom it makes it kind of cumbersome."
5,A terrific Buy,"If you are debating whether to buy a Kindle or not, don't hesitate another second. GO FOR IT! I purchased my Kindle expressly to download books and have enjoyed it tremendously. I've had it a little over a month now and wouldn't trade it for anything. I'm not a ""tekkie"" by any means but it serves my purpose beautifully. I'm just sorry I took so long to decide to take the plunge. I also bought the leather case and I would definitely suggest it to protect the screen, especially if you're going to be carrying it in a book bag or back pack.Go ahead and get youself one -- they're GREAT!"
4,Kindle Reading Device Review & Why this IS NOT a 5-star product,"Love the Kindle - Not only for the books, but for the subscriptions you can buy. No more magazines taking up room in my house! My only issue with this generation or model, why isn't it backlit?? My Laptop is backlit. Along with my cell phone and digital camara. Yes, it would use more battery power, but if you are able to be plugged in, a backlit screen would be amazing! Making this a 5-star product! Use the optional light attatchment when you can't be plugged in.I feel this backlighting would be helpful to all users. Otherwise, I love it!Kindle Wireless Reading DeviceKindle Reading Device Light - (Optional)"
4,Kindle Reader,"This device is so very readable because of the paperlike screen. I feel like I am reading a ""real"" book. The other nice thing is the speed with which I can purchase new books."
3,Janet's Kindle,I was disappointed in the text to voice feature. Very computerized sounding and mispronounces words. I find I must follow along as it reads or I am very confused. I bought for the purpose of listening to books whie driving. Size is nice and for reading only it would be great just not what I hoped for.
5,It lives up to all the hype!,"I have had the Kindle for almost a month now and I can truly say that it is one of the best electronic devices I have ever owned. I find myself reading 2-3 hours each day and Kindle makes the experience so enjoyable! I also am exploring content that I might have passed up previously thanks to the free previews.If you are debating about getting a Kindle, just buy one! I promise you won't be dissapointed."
4,Thanks for the Amazing Kindle,I bought my Kindle in two months ago to use in Australia. I use the Kindle when I travel. Now I have ready access to my library of favourite literature and reference books in one accessible device. The reading experience is excellent; the display is pleasant to use and the page turns are superb. Better than dead-tree books in fact.The wireless access system works very well in both Melbourne and Sydney. I I wish Amazon had a referral scheme because at least three of my fellow travelers have asked me how to buy their own Kindle.This is an environment friendly device. Maybe a green case would be a plus!
4,Thoughts of the device,"Thoughts of the device (Kindle) go like this. First off I did not see the need for the larger kindle since that would have defeated my purpose of transport in my lg purse. I absolutely love my Kindle for this. The reading is everything they say it would be. I give it a ""5"" on a scale of 1-5. I have hooked it up to the computer where I have a study guide (copied from a book) and review it and mark it where I need. It is great all around for MY needs, especially the dictionary and markers that allows me to take notes. I even purchase a newspaper when ever I want. I also got the cover for it that allows me to stand it up while I read and my hands are free. When I am baking or my hands are too busy to hold a book I turn it on audio. It is so nice to have. The only concern is that we are subject to only one place to buy books."
3,Wish had bought it one year later for half the price,I like my kindle- great for newspaper and paperback reading. Favorite feature is perfect visibility under direct sunlight. The reason for the rating has to do with Amazon's price policy: I bought the device in March 2009 for almost $400 - now it sells for less than half that price. Why was the original price so inflated?
1,Missing something?,"I've purchased a book that downloaded through Kindle on my laptop. You can't highlight, you can't place bookmark, the interface does not have a page number. it is impossible to properly quote the book, since there are no pages. Lack of highlighting forces me to re-read text multiple times, trying to locate what's needed.Perhaps the physical version of Kindle is better - that i can't judge, but the PC version lacks some BASIC functionality. Well, to be correct, it has NONE. It would have been better to provide the copy in ADOBE-friendly format, at least there I would've been able to highlight and locate pages :("
2,Price too high for that simple device,$260 is way too much for static grayscale screen! It was also hard to navigate on that screen using 5-way control. Touch sceen would be better.

3,First few hours with the Kindle 2: basic operation,"Length:: 4:13 MinsThis is not really a review, but just an initial tryout of the basic functions.Later, I give my full impression of this device."
3,Feel in love with Kindle but Jilted by a Defective Screen,"I purchased six Kindles as for Christmas gifts (and one for myself). I found myself reading more than I have in years; the pages and time just flew by. So, on my first transpacific flight, I settled in looking forward to many hours of enjoyable reading. Alas, there was a screen defect (only half the screen saver disappeared when waking up the Kindle). Many people had warned me about this problem so I knew all the potential fixes but none worked. After advising customer service of all I had tried, I requested a replacement, but received an email suggesting all the fixes I had already tried and reported in my original replacement request. If I have to wait more than a few more days for a replacement, I am going to be looking seriously at the Apple Tablet."
3,Good but could be better.,"I have only had my Kindle for about 2 months and have enjoyed reading my first book. It is easy to use and I am pleased with the size and handling of the unit. I do believe Amozon missed the boat in not having a backlight on the screen-I find myself reading on my iPhone at night vs the Kindle because my iPhone has a backlight. By the way, the ability to read the same book on my iPhone or computer is a very neat feature.I have had to get a replacement already for the Kindle as the screen went dead-customer service was very helpful and sent a replacement unit the day I called for receipt the next day.Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)"
1,Kindles Break After 1.5 years / not long term durable,"This is my second kindle, and I loved it while I had it. But, the kindle screen broke on this one -- it's permanently frozen. I'm not even sure how that could happen. I leave the Kindle at home, and I never rough it up.Amazon has offered to replace it, but for a cost. My first generation kindle broke too, and they offered me the same deal: replacement for a cost. I'm kind of annoyed that this happened a second time around. So, use these things knowing they have about a 1.5 year life (based on my experience). And I think the warranty is only a year.How frustrating.EDIT:To make matters worse, Amazon customer service sent me mixed messages. They sent me an email a few hours ago saying, essentially, that they would replace the kindle for free. Then, after I wasted another hour with their customer service, they said I would still have to pay a ""fee"" which was rather large. I just don't get it amazon."
2,Does not last long,"i got a kindle February 2010 and it broke in August 2011. then im asked to pay an equivalent amount to purchase the same model and i receive it in September 2011 and it breaks again in 2012. again i'm asked to make another payment. also, amazon does not even give the option of upgrading the model even though i was willing to pay - how's that customer service?i would advice against purchasing this item - maybe the rest of the models are better? not too sure but really not happy with this. i am now hoping to shift to another ebook reader. with so many in the market i can easily purchase something for cheaper.please be careful when you purchase this as replacement cost is crazy!"
3,"Died after a couple of years, and nothing to be done about it","I was a bit disappointed when my Kindle 2 died after only a couple of years for no obvious reason (I bought it new when it was announced). Always liked the Kindle and bought one of the new Touch ones for my wife. I spoke to Amazon but they couldn't help me repair it. They offered to let me buy a 3rd generation Kindle to replace it for $60, but it's not clear to me why I'd not buy a 4th generation for only $19 more than that. If they'd offered me a discount on any Kindle of my choice to replace it I'd have been more tempted.Oh well, off to the Apple Store instead."
3,great but temporary product,"I love(d) this Kindle device! I took it with me everywhere- it was my ""baby"". I kept it in a case and took very good care of it. I used it everyday for a long time with out any problems.However, one day it was sitting on my coffee table.. I turned it on and part of the screen saver ""stuck"" to the main screen / it looked as though it was cracked. I was very upset that my device randomly broke. I called Amazon and they offered an upgrade / replacement for 60$...I just wanted a working product. After googling this it seems that this happens a lot with 2nd gens."
4,Dyslexic tutor review of the Kindle,"As a tutor of dyslexic students who resist reading I love the potential for my students. The features allow a student to customize the page to his or her reading style- bigger font, less words on a page and for some books text to speech.As for myself a person over 60, I love the size and weight. Easier to hold, no more hand cramps from holding a book,easier to carry in my purse and wireless internet allows fast access to a new book anywhere any time."
4,An excellent e-book reader,"This Kindle device offers a text view just slightly smaller than the text on a page of a paperback book, while coming in a handy size for taking along when commuting or travelling.The e-ink gives a sharp, unwavering picture in grey tones that an actively lit screen cannot match.Too bad that Amazon's deal with various non-US cell phone network operators doesn't allow for internet browsing with the device, nor for the transmissing of pictures in newspapers and magazines.International buyers should beware that Amazon's repertoire of non-English e-books is very small and the Kindle doesn't support the most common open e-book standards, so you can't make up for it by buying your non-English e-books elsewhere. If most of your reading is in English anyway, the Kindle is a good buy - but beware of customs and VAT, the Kindle is shipped from USA."
2,Great item plagued by poor quality build,"I received a Kindle2 3/25/09. I love it, but the screen died within the week. Amazon was great, and sent me a replacement ASAP, which I received a week later. Then that one died within two weeks. Again, Amazon was great about replacing product, but I am wondering how long that device will last (I havent received it yet).Super concept, great looking hardware, but I have concerns about the quality of this device, especially in light of the $350+ price-tag. If the product were more reliable (in my opinion) I would post more stars."
2,OK but not completely there,"I've been using a Kindle 2 for a couple of weeks now. I love the convenience of carrying a variety of reading information in one small package and the instant availability of new material, but the device is still nowhere near as satisfying as the real thing. Browsing and leafing through in the book is somewhat awkward. The biggest negative, and it is a big one, is the dingy gray screen. It is much closer to a gloomy winter sky than ""crisp black and white"" as advertised. That gloom seriously detracts from the reading experience, at least for me."
4,You will LOVE LOVE LOVE your Kindle.,The only thing preventing me from giving this 5 stars is the price. I think the price I paid (359) should be more in line with other electronic readers. I love the ability to download wirelessly and to also have access to the Kindle store.
5,Brand new to Kindle!,"I've never seen or handled a Kindle before mine came, or even seen an e-book. However, being an avid reader I could see immediately how this could be the best purchase I've made in a long time. It didn't disappoint me in the least. I love to re-read books, so I'm in the habit of keeping all the books I've ever purchased. You can imagine what my bookshelves look like. The appeal of having all your books on one device (much like an ipod) was seductive at the very least. I absolutely love the built-in dictionary. The device itself it well designed and easy to use. I'm amazed at how many things it can do besides reading a book. Of course it's primarily a reader, but what a great toy as well! I consider the money very well spent and highly recommend this to others."
5,KINDLE GIFT,"I have not actually used or even seen this Kindle purchased for my goddaughter, but she has written me rave reviews and has been using it constantly since she received it. It was supposed to be for Christmas but neither of us could wait. She is delighted with it and a most enthusiast user."
5,Good Reading,"Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)A great idea and great product; takes up no space in luggage or on a trip."
4,Love my new Kindle!,"After talking for over a year about obtaining a Kindle, my husband purchased one for me. I absolutely love it! I often wait for the paperback version of books to come out but no more - the cost of a hardcover book allows me to purchase my favorite author's book right away. I have a 1 1/2 hour commute to work each way, so the ""read to me"" is wonderful! It makes my drive much more enjoyable. I have only 3 ""complaints"":1. It's great that the font can be changed for the books, but my sister has vision problems. She needs the menus to be changed to larger font, too. Maybe we just haven't figured out how to do that.2. The publishers who don't allow the read-to-me function are not thinking clearly. There are books that I already own that I would repurchase for my Kindle if that function was available. I won't purchase audio books because the cost is too high and they are usually abridged.3. I have to purchase one for my daughter; we share too many books for us not to both have a Kindle."
5,Love my Kindle,I have wanted a Kindle for 2 years. I finally broke down and got myself an early christmas present. It's worth every penny. I take it with me on long car trips and can read the paper or a book or listen to books and downloaded radio programs. I got a cheap clip-on light so that I can read late at night without disturbing my hubby. It is my new favorite toy. Great product.
4,Chinese Kindle,"I hope Chinese Kindle would be available in China soon, at the same weight and same size but cheaper. China is a vast country with most of its people now travel with public transport. Chinese also like reading. So I think Chinese Kindle would be successful."
2,Great when it works,I've had my Kindle for about half a year now. It's great when it works but I have had to return it two time already and now I'm going to have to return the one I have.I've read some reviews that said people weren't able to return their broken Kindles. I've never had a problem with that. Kindle has always been quick with sending me a replacement and taking care of the postage for the return.
4,Love the Kindle but...,"All in all it's a very well-made, solid device. About the only bad thing I can say about it is that I can't figure out why Amazon can spend bazillions of dollars developing and marketing a device, and then ship the international version with a US plug. AND then have the audacity to list it as a ""feature"" in the product description.Come on guys, it's a $2 part, but it's exclusion mars what would otherwise be an absolutely fantastic product."
5,Kindle Global Rules,"I live overseas and have been waiting for an international version. I quickly jump on the board when the kindle was available. As I love hard cover books and own a pretty big collection, I look forward to complimenting it with my Kindle. Downloads are as fast as advertised. The only problem I have RIGHT now is how do I stop buying so many books :-)I take it everywhere I go. 2 thumbs up and a SWING!!!!"
1,Rating for International Version (used in Germany),"This review is just for the international Version used in Germany.The Kindle itself (used in the US) is a very good device. In Germany it has several downsides described here:1. Magazines and Newspapers do not have Images and Photos included in Germany (That is for me the biggest downside)2. Newspapers are more expensive (even German ones) and this without Photos!! Example FAZ U.S. price 14.99$ --> German price 27$ Thats insane3. Wikipedia does not load images in Germany4. Browser is deactivated (well this is something I knew in advance)5. Blog are deactivated. (well this is something I knew in advance)6. More expensive due to taxes delivery ... (this of course, I knew in advance, too)Overall a not very satisfactory package. I think I will return the reader. For people who really only read books it would perhaps be nice even with these downsides."
1,Kindle2 product not durable,"My less than a week old Kindle2 fell from my nightstand onto carpet and no longer works. Apparently the little video promo of it falling doesn't really tell the whole story. Amazon says it will cost me $200 to have it replaced. I don't dare because what if it falls or gets bumped again? I had already downloaded books, purchased the cover and nightlight and now my ""cool"" Birthday present is not usable. I am extremely disappointed to say the least."
1,Huge disappointment,"I wouldnt recommend a kindle to anybody. I purchased a 3g kindle for my step daughter in Tennesee for christmas and trying to send her books is ridiculous. It charged me $3.30 and almost 24 hours later they all still havent even made it to the kindle. I paid extra for ""free"" 3g because she has no internet or wifi where she lives yet it still charges me to send documents. I tried to send via email but that dont work, you can only send to the @kindle address. It would just be a nuisance and not a problem if she had internet access, I could send to email then she could transfer from computer to kindle.I also found out Amazon can and does delete books that you rightfully bought from them when they decide you have had it long enough.My cell phone is more useful than this kindle, at least it can save email attachments and I dont get charged every time i get an attachment.DO YOUR RESEARCH BRFORE BUYING. THERE ARE A LOT OF DEVICES LIKE THIS AND IM SURE THERE ARE BETTER OPTIONS."
1,AWFUL EXPERIENCE.,This is not working. It says it is automatically registered if purchased through Amazon. Wrong. Won't accept network password and won't set up another network. Unable to register at Amazon.com. No video instructions posted for the latest generation Kindle. First headache I have had in 20 years.
2,Very poor quality,"I bought this Kindle in February 2010. I purchased a cover and never take the kindle anywhere without packing it securely. Over six months later I was given the option of purchasing insurance for the kindle. Of course, you couldn't buy it after six months. So nice that they sent it over six months later. My Kindle has now developed black lines across the screen. The corner that shows battery level and signal strength is black. The lines are gradually getting thicker and blocking more and more of my page. With the care I take with this product and the amount of time I have had the kindle, I feel it is very poor quality. I love the ease of purchasing on Amazon, but other products do the same. I will not be replacing my Kindle with a Kindle."
3,Ayurveda: A Practical Guide: The Science of Self Healing.... By Vasant Lad,"Reading book on Kindle is a nice experience but having a big big problem in reading ""Charts and Tables"". Tried all different ways to enlarge Font size but no avail. Talked to Amazon Rep and he could not help either. He suggested to review and let Publisher know your problem. According to him the publisher supplies the book with tables and charts unreadable. This book has tons of charts and tables and book loses its value because of this persistance problem. I wish I was told about this problem before I bought this book. I am totally surprised that no one has bothered to rectify this problem. If this is not resolved it is worthless to buy a book with Kindle format.Suggestion: Publisher should SCAN all tables and charts and provide them via E-mail to purchaser.I would appreciate a response by Publisher or Amazon.E-mail: kcs.houston@comcast.netThanksKC"
3,Size matters!,"First gripe.....Why can't they make the new devices the same size so you can re-use what you bought for your original product! Iphone... guilty, and now Kindle... guilty! You are insisting we buy buy buy instead of recycling! We don't need more book covers and more cables! We need compatibility.....Second gripe! I cannot even use my Kindle 2 because the serial number doesn't match what was registered in my name, therefore I cannot connect and register. Talk about high-tech! I have called twice and while they are helpful, this matter has not been solved yet....."
4,"Nice device, but why not go Solar?","It's a nice device, nice features and so on. I wonder how much more it would cost, or how hard it would be to add some solar panels to allow recharge and use without having to EVER plug it in? This would lend to to be even more useful in situations where you wouldn't have otherwise access.Get the most out of it's low batter consumption!"
5,"I <3 you Amazon, and your customer service is awesome!","Correction to post:I purchased two Kindle's one on Mothers day for my mom, and one about 2 weeks later for myself. When I saw the price drop I was a little upset. However I called Amazon and explained that I was 34 days out and since I purchased two I would really think it is fair the reimburse 1 of those 70 dollars. The lady was so nice and agreed right away to drop my price of the last one I purchased. So even though I was not within the 30 days she was more than happy to do it since I was so close.I <3 you Amazon. And you always go above and beyond in your customer service!"
2,returning my kindle,"yes kindle is good for what it is;namely an electronic reading device that can have so many books, newspapers, magazines and more at your finger tips. if you are thinking about buying this product you should consider all the positives the kindle has to offer and ask yourself DO I REALLY NEED THIS. for me an avid reader i felt the tactile sensation of reading with the kindle to be horrible, bad bad bad. i wonder why there are mostly positive reviews for this product? maybe the reviewers helped design the kindle or work for amazon."
2,useless for PC,I spent around 50 dollars on a book expecting to be able to view it as I would a PDF in the Kindle PC client version that I recently downloaded. There isn't even a scrollbar. waste of money. I'll buy the physical book next time since it will be easier to navigate than via kindle.
5,"If you love reading, buy this device.","I received the Kindle 2 for my birthday and it has been my constant companion ever since. Its light weight makes it easy to hold without my arms becoming fatigued. I recommend Amazon incorporate a lighted screen with a switch to turn the light on and off. This wouldn't add weight and wouldn't necessitate ording a seperate clip-on light from Amazon, which I'm waiting to receive. Ordering books from Amazon via my PC or Kindle is extremely easy and instantaneousness. The free Whispernet is a great feature. I highly recommend Kindle 2 to anyone who enjoys reading."
5,VERY HAPPY,Simply delighted with Kindle! Strongly recommend buying the cover as well as AC adapter and car adapter.I use Kindle daily and love it!
1,Steals already-bought products,"Unbelievable, not only does it make you give up the printed version, but amazon deletes your books (YOUR, as in, you paid for) for no reason. I'd better wait for a reader that doesn't rip you off"
1,Buyer Beware,"What could be a great product and is certainly a growing trend in paper-book alternatives, Kindle is unfortunately mired in DRM. Kindles software can delete your books without your permission, it happened to hundreds of users where Kindle deleted their George Orwell books 1984 and Animal Farm.Kindle could one day be a great alternative to numerous books, but for George Orwell fans and anyone else who doesn't like having their books stolen, stick to the paper-bound versions for now."
3,"Good tech, overpriced books","I've had a Kindle for more than 8 months. At first I was able to find inexpensive or free books and was quite happy. Now, it's become much harder and I can't help feeling slightly betrayed when a Kindle price is simple a dollar or two off the paperback price.Until Amazon gets more reasonable in their pricing structure, I'd recommend against the Kindle."
2,Watch The Book Prices Accelerate!,"The product was good, but Amazon promised, and I believed, that they would hold the line on best seller prices, but they have shot up over fifty per cent in six months! A pulp fiction book, in e form, which you cannot loan, sell, or give away, can NEVER be worth as much as a hard copy. Back to paperbacks, libraries, and used book stores like Powell's for me. My Nook has not started this price jacking yet, as far as I have seen."
3,"Amazon, you need to learn from SONY","I've had my Kindle2 for about a month now. I use it daily, and so far I enjoy it very much.However I don't know if I will be able to stay as a loyal customer for much longer... Amazon seems to dominate the market for now, but I think if they don't improve, sooner or later they will lose the market to other e-reader devises, and here are the top three reasons:1. No open book source2. No open book source3. No open book sourceSony is coming out with its new e-reader this December which also has the free wifi function and unlike Kindle, it is suppose to support millions of free digital books from Google and epub and many other open sources.Amazon, I hate to say this, but you need to act soon! or you'll loose all the potential customers and eventually all the existing customers as well."
4,Love This!,"I received the Kindle today and it is fantastic. I have to admit that I have never tried an electronic book so I do have anything to compare it with. It is very easy and simple to purchase books. I was concerned that I would not like reading something that is not actually a book in book form, but it is easy to read and I hope to enjoy it for a long time. I will post more after I have used it for a while."
4,former skeptic,"I was not expecting to like my first Kindle, a gift from a close relative, because I have always been a lover of books. To my amazement, i find myself purchasing more books than ever before, signing up for e-periodicals, and downloading out-of-copyright classics that i've never read before. Definitely worth the price, especially the new lower one."
1,Pay your money -- lose your book,WHY would anyone purchase a book reader from a company who disables what you buy? Its beyond me.
1,Kindle Swindle!,The recent deletion of legitimately purchased content has encouraged me never to buy a product like this. Why do the corporations feel the need to control content even after it is purchased? I want my tech with no strings attached..
2,The contrast is too low to read,The contrast between the text and background is too low. I have to strain my eyes to recognize the text. After a few minutes of reading my eyes get weary. A regular book has 2-3 times better contrast.
4,Newer and better,"A much improved Kindle over the Kindle 1. However, I did like the wheel verus the button to navigate the screen. The wheel was quicker and easier to highlight and use the dictionary.The page turners, home, menu and back buttons are a vast improvement in that you don't accidently activate by holding and or movibng the Kindle from hand to hand.The key board is far better to utilize and the navigate button has more functons than the wheel.Of course the battery is a vast improvement and the abillity to listen to the books being read is wonderful, especially when one's eyes start to tire.Bottom line is the Kindle 2 is far better than its predecesser."
5,Fabulous!,I already had a first generation Kindle so when my husband bought me a K2 for my birthday I was thrilled. It is just a fabulous device. EVERY reader needs a Kindle! Thank you honey!
4,Kindle 3G,The Kindle 3G works well and downloads books very fast. I found the online Q & A most helpful and have used the kindle at the beach and and their is no sun glare. The Kindle has everything you could want and I am most pleased with the ease of operation.
2,No hyperlinks in some books,"Amazon apparently sells some books without hyperlinks to chapters. I recently bought a technical book, which one doesn't read cover to cover, and spent an hour trying to navigate to the chapter I wanted.When I asked Amazon customer support, the reply was ""thank you for your feedback."" I wasn't giving feedback. I was asking if they knew that something was wrong with this book when they sold it. I wanted to know if there was some secret trick their user gudide didn't cover. I wanted to know how to get my money back for a useless purchase. They didn't respond to any of those needs.If they want to charge $350 for an electronic reading device, they have to make the product more useful than a paper book. They haven't done that.This kind of thoughtless customer service is inexcusable for a product in this price range.If you read anything other than romance novels, think twice about buying a Kindle 2."
1,can delete your books overnight,these people think they own your kindle even after you pay for it (and your books). woke up to a deleted series of books.
4,"Leanda's Kindle 6""","Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)I recieved the 6"" Kindle as a gift. After charging it up, Wow was I ever surprised when I started to look at it . It's easy to read and easy to navigate around on. I was a bit disappointed that you can't download directly from your computer to the Kindle and that you have to submit anything you have through Kindle and the they charge you for that privilage? Overall though I love it"
5,love it love it love it,"Love it, love it, love it. I have not had a single problem with it, the battery last just the right amount of time, it is so portable, it is so dependable, and totally awesome!"
5,KINDLE 2,I PURCHASED A KINDLE 2 AND MY WIFE AND I LOVED IT. WE PURCHASED ANOTHER FOR HER. GREAT PRODUCT.
1,Terrible experience. Its a headache to use it outside the US.,"If you are traveling outside the US and try to buy your first book with your new Kindle, you will receive a message saying that you need to Amazon customer support. When you click on the customer support link, it gives you the option of downloading the Kindle's Manual which is completely useless for your problem or gives you the number to call customer support. It also blocks your Kindle so you cant buy anything.They have copied from Apple the feel and look. The white front design, the aluminum on the back, but the first experience using that device if you are outside of the US its opposite to using an apple device for the first time. Its just a big headache."
3,I liked Kindle 1 better,"I love my Kindle 1, and figured my new K2 would be a nice step up, and give me and my wife two Kindles in the house.1. It comes without a cover. No kidding. Nothing. I guess I'm supposed to just carry this $350 item around without any protection whatsoever. They want $25 for a plastic one, $30 for leather, $10 shipping. Kindle 1 had a useful cover right out of the box. Shame on Amazon.2. It's just clunky to use. Generally the interface is just non-intuitive, at least for me. I got around my K1 quickly and effortlessly, without reading the entire manual. Not so with K2. I have to look up EVERYTHING. This is another example of a design team trying to fix something that isn't broken."
2,Jacob Nielsen's Review,"As a usability professional, I thought you might find this article in Jacob Nielsen's Alert Box on the Kindle 2: http://www.useit.com/alertbox/kindle-usability-review.htmlDr. Nielsen is an author, researcher, and consultant on user interfaces, especially Web usability."
2,Downloading outside the USA,"I really enjoyed using my new Kindle2 in the USA but since I travel overseas much of the time I am disappointed to be unable to download from the Kindle Store to my computer, and then from my computer to the Kindle2 using the USB connection. Also, the so-called Customer Service people will not respond to my emails!Take 2. In view of the comments, I unreservedly retract my unkind remarks and award 5*s! Thanks to those who helped. I have now figured out how to do what I need to do. However, I still believe Customer Service should respond to emails and not expect me to make expensive phone calls from outside the USA!"
3,Too expensive,"The Kindle was great, till I returned it because the cost was too high. I am a graduate student and had intended to use it to carry all my pdf documents to class, but the conversion of photo copied pdfs to the Kindle was just not worth the money. I figure once I have a real salary I'll get one, but for now the price tag is just too high."
3,Very disappointed with battery life.,"I am extremely disappointed with the battery life of my Kindle 2.Twice now I've had it powered off (standby?) in my briefcase and twice now, after three days, the battery has become depleted. What's the point in having an eBook reader that must be charged every single day whether you're using it or not?With all due respect to Amazon: my iPhone gets better battery life on standby!---Update:First, for those wondering: WhisperNet is off, and there's only one book in the device.Sorry fellas. My review stands."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I struggled for months about going to an electronic book. I am always looking for the newest technology and consider my self a new adaptor but for some reason the idea of looking at a computer screen to read just bothered me.After hearing from numerous Kindle owners how much they enjoyed it and noticing Amazon lowered the price, i took the plunge and made the purchase.I love it! easy to read, easy to navigate, purchase books,and its convenient size are all positive!Only frustration i have experienced is trying to find specific pages in a book that i have read before. I knew the page numbers i was looking for but had to scroll thru electronic version to find. Maybe there's a way to do this and i just haven't figured it out.All and all it was a great choice for me and would do it again."
4,"Amazing, but only if you have the right formats","Im a pretty heavy reader, and have wanted to get a Kindle for a very long time. After finally buying one, i haven't been disappointed. I was expecting the page turn refresh to get annoying, but i barely even noticed it. So far my only wish is that it supported more formats. Over the years i have accumulated a good sized library of ebooks and mangas on my computer. They are all in various different formats, and as such only a few were ready to immediately be loaded on the Kindle. After searching the web i found the Mobipocket Creator. Its a free download that allowed me to easily convert my books into .prc files, which the Kindle handles easily. It even converted the mangas, which were only folders of pictures. Its too bad that this extra step is needed, but after doing so it has made the Kindle completly worth the cost"
5,I LOVE IT,"I love my Kindle & recommend it for anyone who is a book freak. It's easy to take with you in case you find a dull spot in your day.It took a few days to get used to it because it doesn't handle like a ""real"" book, but after I got used to it, I was hooked. One of the weird things about it is that it has no page numbers on the bottom of the pages, but states what percent of the book you have read instead. It's also remarkable how you can choose a book from Amazon & it's practically in your Kindle immediately. Maybe that part's a bit TOO easy. All-in-all, I find it amazing."
3,Software updated,">> Your Kindle can now display PDF documents without losing the formatting of the original file.This is great!>> Some features are not currently supported, including annotations, Text-to-Speech, and zooming and panning.Although, need several more stretch. Zooming and Panning is must."
3,My Amazon Kindle,The Kindle should come with an instuction booklet already printed out instead of asking the user to print out over 100 pages of instructions. In addition I find that every now and then after closing the kindle at a specific page the kindle reopens to another page - not the last one I was reading. In addition ther is not way to know what page you are on - all you get is a % notation. In my opinion the Kindle needs work!
2,Does not support any other language,"The kindle is a nice product and provides an unique capability that no other product can. But as a foreign student, I love to read some books in my native language, which is Korean. For the fact that the Kindle does not support multi-language package, it is a huge turn-off point. I am sure the Kindle supports unicode, so I am not sure why they can't support multi-language font package in their product as an option."
1,International Kindle,The device itself is great and if I could use all functionalities it would get a 5 star.But a lot (if not all) popular books are not available for sale in several countries in Europe. Also the internet browser is not available in Europe. The lack of available books is not mentioned by Amazon and I hope they will make them available as soon as possible.
3,Generally satisfied,"I was quite surprised how quickly I got to love reading on the Kindle. The screen is very easy on the eyes and the general operation of the machine is easy and smooth. I have just started using the device because it just became operational in my country. Although the machine is fine, I was not impressed with the first book I read. I downloaded ""Too Big To Fail"". There were a number of typos in the book and at least one place where a short range of text was repeated. I also did not like that the notes were not linked to the text. I didn't even discover the reems of notes until I had finished reading the book. Not very helpful. Why can't the notes be noted properly in the text and linked? Overall, impressed with the reading experience, but the downloads could use work. Not perfect yet."
5,New diabetic reader,"I just got my Kindle 2 for my birthday in September. I have read a book a day since discovering Nancy Drew in 2nd grade. Last year when I turned fifty I got the American adult booby prize; diabetes adult onset and insulin dependent. My Kindle first started out as a fun toy, then as my vision got a little blurry I found the Aa key where you can adjust the size of the print. On bad days, it will read out loud to me. I have used it to stay preoccupied and distracted while undergoing diet and exercise and insulin therapy and it has kept my spirits high and and allowed me to keep reading. Not to mention saving all those trees that are no longer turning to dust in my basement with all my other old books. Congratulations to the genius that thought this up."
4,I love my new kindle,"I love my new kindle. It makes my life so much easier and I can be more efficient and waste less paper. A few things I wish it was able to do like get journal articles from different medical and social science journals. I thought it had this feature but I don't think it has the capabilities. Also had a little trouble one day and it sort of froze and then restarted itself but it was fine after that. Other than a few limited capabilities and the minor glitch, I am very happy with it and all it's features. Also, was somewhat frustrated that amazon came out with a newer and both cheaper versions two weeks after I got it but Amazon's customer service has been very helpful with the situation and exploring my options. Overall, I am so excited about my new toy!"
3,Joining the Kindle Club,"Several friends showed me their Kindles - raving about the convenience and ease of use. So far, I love my Kindle!! The feature I like best is the page turner. No more pages flapping back, especially while I'm reading while walking on a treadmill.On a recent vacation, I used it on the plane and in the hotel. It is so compact and easy to use. I finished one book and started another with a click of the Kindle. Living in a condo with limited storage for books, I find the Kindle allows me to purchase books for less than hardback or even paperback prices and keep them handy without clutter. I like being able to highlight and add notes throughout the book. I belong to several book clubs and can refer to my notes easily.I purchased a leather cover for my Kindle. Not only does it protect the Kindle, but has a strap which forms an easel-like platform to stand the Kindle while reading.I think e-books are the future of reading."
1,What a scam - DO NOT BUY!!!,"Anyone who pays Amazon for the ""privilege"" of being able to rent a book from them is crazy. These things are ridiculously over priced - they should be free. Amazon should give one to anybody who is willing to pay for the rental content.Someday, somebody will make one of these e-books that has a screen the size of a magazine with color and a transparent (to the user) interface. It will sell for a fair price and the content will be DRM and Big Brother-free. This device is nothing of the sort and anybody who buys one is paying an ""early adopter"" tax while Amazon figures out it's business model..."
1,not as advertised,"Cool toy but there are not all the authors the advertisers want you to believe there are. I have two favorite authors, one has published 78 books, Kindle has 4 books available, another author has published 50 some and Kindle has a grand total of 3 available.I was totally disappointed.Kindle is a nice concept but perhaps in the future when more authors works are available but right now the choice of books to download are not as complete as advertised.On the other hand, the company was a pleasure to do business with. Quick delivery with a quick, cheerful refund when I was unsatisfied with the product"
1,Faulty Drop test,"I have had a Kindle about two months. It fell off my car seat (10 inches) on a double carpet car floor. Kindle broken and cost charged to repair is $206.00. If so prone to breaking, why not a case furnished at purchase-loved using it, but would be hesitant to purchase again!"
4,Very Good but one significant drawback,"I've been using the Kindle 2 for six weeks or so and while it is wonderful in many ways there is one major drawback in my opinion. The good news is Amazon has truly enhanced the user navigation via the five way button. Book and periodical purchasing via wireless transfer is easy and incredibly fast. The screen is superb.The only complaint I have, and this is a significant one, is that the Kindle handles illustrations very poorly. While the typeface in a book can be enlarged nothing in an illustration can be adjusted in size. The result is many and I do mean many illustrations are illegible.Overall Kindle is wonderful for reading novels and periodicals, but if you like to buy educational type books that generally have illustrations for reference, the Kindle is less than ideal and just can't handle them very well. Perhaps this will be fixed in future software releases for the device but for now it's a drawback."
1,Buyer Beware -- Serious design failure,"While the Kindle works well enough, the device has a serious design failure. Should your kindle be lost or stolen, Amazon claims that it can not/will not disable the stolen device. As a consequence, every book downloaded, any personal information within page clippins, notes can be freely accessed. This failure not only puts personal and financial security at risk but, in effect, serves as an incentive to be stolen. An inability to deactivate a stolen Kindle is highly suspect if not downright unethical. Come on, think about it -- for every Kindle in a consumer's hand (stolen or othewise), Amazon makes money. In essence, Amazon seems to be saying, ""sorry you got robbed but it's not our problem"" even worse the customer's misfortune becomes Amazon gain. A lousy way to do business.Shame on you Amazon."
3,Read the fine print if you travel,"I bought the Kindle because it is now ""global"" and had ""no monthly fees"", so I could use it continue reading the NY Times and Economist when I'm outside the US traveling. Silly me, I didn't read the fine print. If you travel, then there are either individual charges of $1.99, or a weekly charge of $4.99, to download content. No ""monthly fees"", they're weekly!So that's $20/month to have content delivered, versus the $30 that Apple has quoted for unlimited 3G data (domestically of course). Sounds like Amazon needs a new negotiator for their communications services.The bottom line is that ""global"" and ""no monthly fees"" should not be in the same product description because if you take advantage of the ""global"" you will definitely be paying fees!"
3,nice but not quite what we had hoped for,"We purchased a Kindle for our adult son with a form of dyslexia. He lives alone. He has always enjoyed being read to. The ""read it aloud"" feature was what prompted us to buy it. Unfortunately it has a ""tinny"" voice and mispronounces/ stumbles over words. We should have checked to make sure more books we thought he would enjoy would be available with that feature. He has figured out how to go back to where he was in a book and does say he likes having it. Hopefully soon there will be more of the books we were hoping for with that feature. I would love to see an upgrade to a better voice."
4,great product-slowest shipping.,"The Kindle latest generation is an excellent product, but Amazon continues to have the slowest free shipping on the internet. The accessory products I purchased through Amazon at the same time arrived a full week earlier."
1,Amazon International Kindle,"I am not happy with the international kindle. I tried to purchase Dan Brown's latest bestseller - Lost Symbols - and it wasn't available. I know the Amazon bookstore has this book but for some reason I can't buy it on my Kindle. What's going on? Also I tried to browse the web and wasn't allowed to. When will you offer a touch screen, colour reader?"
2,Veyr Disappopinted,The Kindle did not work. We spent many hours on the telephone without getting any meaningful help or satisfaction from Amazon. Then Amazon refused to replace it. I was hoping for a better product (but recognize electronic equipment doesn't always work) and better service (recognizing Amazon has a lot to learn).
3,Will the Kindle ever come to Canada?,"Finally the Kindle is available internationally for instance Berundi, it is not however yet available in Canada, that far off strange place to the north. What is truly galling is you can't even buy it in Canada, never mind worrying about loading content. A great idea but a failure in marketing."
2,display not as good as K1,"I really like the Kindle 1, and was excited to get the K2, but it's going back. Side by side, the K1's print is blacker; the K2 is more of a gray. Customer support said that it depends on the book (?), and has to do with the 16 levels of gray scale. And there is no adjustment. Pretty dumb, since 99.9% of the time you want black-on-white.I suppose it would have looked okay if I didnt have a K1 to compare it to, but contrast is more important than the other new features considering the price. Oh well, maybe when the 3 comes out...."
2,Disappointed with book selection and periodical prices,"I have had a DX for 2 months. I have quickly learned the downside of doing Kindle business with Amazon. No matter what book I see in any newspaper's book review, I can be assured it isn't available on Kindle. Examples include Michael Lewis's very popular new book, ""Panic"", and a book reviewed today in the Wash Post, ""Germania"" by Simon Winder. You can have any book you want as long as it's been out for a year, I guess. Also, the price of newspapers on this thing are very high. I can understand paying a fee for a periodical, even though it may be free on the web, to cover the cost of whispernet. But, $10.99 a month for the NYT? Are they out of their mind? I also was not aware that all material in periodicals not included in articles is removed. Want to see that full page ad from some PAC everyone is talking about? By a dead tree copy of the Times. I am beginning to hate this thing."
1,3G Coverage :(,"I do own a K2 and a DX. Both were purchased before the international version. Be warned, the international version uses ATT and not Sprint. ATT coverage is spotty focusing mostly around interstates and cities. Living in rural areas usually means no coverage. ATT also has a history of poor call quality. If the Kindle had always used ATT, I would have never purchased them. Now I wonder if Amazon is going to leave me unable to use 3G"
5,It's reignited my love of reading,"After months & months of fighting the urge to get myself a kindle I finally gave in and ordered one. All I can say is WOW! Best $300 I've spent all year. In the 2 months since it arrived I've already read more books than in the past 2 years. If you're thinking about getting one just give in to temptation and click on ""Add to Cart"" now, I can't see how any lover of literature could possibly not fall in love with it once they've given it a fair chance to impress."
3,Font size is not big enough,"I am giving this a 4 because I had baught this for my father ,who has scaring in his eyes. He could just make out the words on my sony's highest font which only has 3 font sizes, so I baught the kindle 2, which has 6 different fonts. Unfortunately , the highist font size on the kindle is smaller then my sony. Don't get me wrong I will keep it for myself because it is a great little reader but I still need to find something for my father."
5,great product!,"I purchased my Kindle 2 about a month ago and I have been quite impressed with it. It is easy to use and downloading books is a snap! With limited storage space for books, the Kindle is the only way for me to hold on to more of the books I love. I just came back from vacation and everyone I showed it to was going to go out and buy one."
5,Kindle purchase,"I love this product. It is amazing. If you are a reader, you will never leave home without it!"
3,WARNING TO UK BUYERS,"I received the international Kindle this week. Buyers of the Kindle for UK use should be made aware that, contrary to the advertising:(1) UK users cannot read blogs(2) Some key publications cannot be downloaded in the UK e.g. The Economist(3) Newspaper subscriptions do not download first thing in the morning, when you want to read the paper!I am happy with the Kindle and its basic use, reading books. BUT i feel cheated that I spend the same money on buying the product as US users but do not get any of the peripheral features and services that US users receive.I chose the Kindle over Sony because it came with 3G. But whats the point if there is little benefit?!Amazon, sort it out!"
2,INCREDIBLY FRAGILE,"I loved my Kindle 2 for the first two months I had it. But one night it slipped from my hands and fell about 2 feet. (about the height shown in the very misleading drop test video). It did not survive. I had received the Kindle as a gift and hadn't realized that the extended warranty was an option. Without it, I was told I could pay $200 to replace my Kindle with a refurbished Kindle that could not be covered by the warranty. I just can't afford to pay that much for an ebook. Amazon really needs to work on the durability of the Kindle. It's really a shame."
2,Not Ready for Prime Time,"The new Kindle is regarded as an improvement over the first version. In my opinion it is still a long way from being a desirable product.The screen is small - smaller than a paperback - and lacks contrast, which makes it harder to read than a book. The one book I downloaded, a Robert B. Parker novel, had wide spaces between paragraph and thus required about twice as many pages. Which means you have to push the button to flip pages every 10 seconds or so. And the pages flip with an odd, jerky movement.The Kindle now lets you display Adobe Acrobat and Microsoft Word files. You have to e-mail them first to a web-site, which converts them to the Kindle format and sends them back to you. The result is less than impressive. The two files I tried were badly mangled, with illustrations in the wrong places or blacked out and text with special characters unreadable.I am returning my Kindle and I'm going to stick to reading books for a while longer."
1,BEWARE: Great device - Terrible construction - Horrible customer service!,"I received the Kindle 2 as a birthday gift and had it for less than a week.It was dropped from a height of about 12-14 inches.And now the display is completely unreadable.I called customer service and they want $200 to replace (they can't fix).Now I'm not sure I even want one if they break like glass.Unless you live in a hermetically sealed house filled with down pillows and bubble wrap, I cannot recommend the device to anyone."
1,DRM encumbered,"The theory of EBooks is great, but the Kindle is DRM encumbered, like the Ipod and the Windows 7 why bother with the intrusion on ""Fair Use"" that was established by the lawsuits over the VCR. I prefer a cheaper Palm or Linux-based small netbook by which I can load PDF's or better OpenDoc format books onto to read from the likes of Project Gutenberg and other legal sources. If the Kindle (like the iPod) entertains removal of this fundamental mistrust of the user, I'll entertain buying one, until then I'll pass."
4,Two weeks with Kindle 2,"I've had my Kindle 2 for two weeks now, having never had any other electronic reader. First the pluses: has worked flawlessly, both the unit itself and the wireless downloading; love the convenience and capacity of the unit, and there's no doubt my reading has increased; the minuses: I wish the screen were larger (many more page turnings are required even when using smallest font than when reading a paper book), I wish the screen could be lighter in color (thus giving better contrast between text and page), and finally, I wish the buttons could be silent (the clicking can disturb others nearby in a very quiet environment). On balance, the pluses outweigh the minuses; I'm sold and will keep my Kindle and will always be an electronic reader. If Amazon listens to its customers, Kindle 3 in a year or two will approach perfection. But its not worth waiting for it."
5,Love my Kindle 2,"The Kindle 2 is the best book reader going. I take me Kindle everywhere I go. If Im not reading the Kindle, it is reading to me. Thanks Amazon."
5,Excellent upgrade to the K1,"The Kindle2 is much more of an upgrade than I had previously thought it was going to be. The buttons seem to be in better locations. The side buttons now hinge towards the screen, so pressing on the outter edges of the kindle while holding or moving it won't accidentally change the page. This was a constant problem with the K1.The device is slimmer, has a better screen, and the keyboard is much nicer. My one complaint is that it doesn't come with a cover. A device like this should come with one.I hear some people complaining about the lack of expandable memory, and replaceable battery. I honestly don't think it's a big deal. I buy plenty of books and haven't had an issue with space. Even with a few albums worth of MP3's.The battery can be charged by USB as well, so that adds to the versatility of charging the battery. Anywhere you have a PC or laptop, you can charge your K2.In my opinion, it's a great upgrade from the K1."
4,kindle 2,Amazing product I love it!!!!! Just wish there were graphic novels and/or manga avalable. Because I would buy TONS!!!!!
5,Kindle,"I ordered the Kindle as a birthday present and it arrived within 5 days, earlier than expected. My husband loves it and I am wondering how he managed beforehand."
4,Easy reader!,"Bought my Kindle (2nd generation) about 1 month ago. VERY happy with it so far. The screen is very easy on your eyes. Haven't tried all the rest of the features yet, to busy reading. Biggest complaint I have is that it is not backlit. Not sure why this is. Why put all that work into something so nice and then leave out an important feature. Bought a clip on light that works fine, but a pain to remember to bring along on trips. Also bought the Kindle cover to protect my investment and it is working out great. I would recomend the Kindle to anyone who loves to read!"
4,Needed Improvements,"1) Too easy to accidentally click the ""Home"" key instead of ""Next Page"" just beneath it.2)Should have touch-screen capability for bringing up word meaning.3)Should have the FULL definition,in larger font, not requiring clicking on the left-arrow key.4)Left arrow key WAY too tiny. Should be placed separate from keyboard.5)Next Page buttons should be set higher up on sides."
1,Nice to have but don't buy one,"It's a nice gadget and I'd like to have one but... It's not the list full of features that breaks this deal. It's what Amazon can do with your files if he decides you should not have them. And he can do plenty, including deleting them without your permission. For me this is enough to never consider spending money on it."
5,Better than Sony,Wow! beats the Sony Reader hands down! Fantastic! The remote access to new books makes all the difference. We need access to more European titles though!
2,Too pricey,"I'll consider a Kindle when the price comes down to $150 and Kindle books are offered at $6.99. Like hardware companies selling dirt-cheap ink-jet printers so they can charge $5000 a gallon for ink-jet cartridges, Amazon is laughing all the way to the bank by charging $9.99 for mass-audience electronic books. Advice: hold off on purchasing a Kindle till they offer rational pricing!"
3,"Great, if you want Amazon repossessing your purchases","I was charitable and gave this device 3 stars for its technological accomplishments.However, look at the news today and you will see that Amazon has stricken Orwell's 1984 and Animal Farm from it's collection because of a publisher dispute. (ok, that happens and is understandable.)However, they also went as far as to delete ALREADY PURCHASED copies from users' digital lockers and EVEN THEIR OWN KINDLES. (To be fair, they refunded the money.)However, this is s STRANGE concept of ownership and dare I say, a tad Orwellian? So any book you buy can and will be deleted by Amazon at any time, for any reason they see fit.How many stars is it really worth if you can't have the confidence that once you buy something, it is yours?Buy it or don't buy it. But buyer, you were warned."
1,Not worth the cost,"Very disappointed! The overall layout is clunky. Screen refresh and flashing is annoying. The device is not intuitive. Not sure I understand the hype surrounding this product. I purchased it for competitive analysis thinking there would be something novel. Not impressed. I read through some of the 5 star ratings and just do not get their enthusiasm considering we have these interesting devices called ""smart phones""."
1,Free the printed word don't buy kindle,"I just couldn't get excited about this device and then a friend told me Amazon deleted purchased books from users' kindles. Unfortunate that Amazon bought into the copy protection myth. Pay for what you use, but no reason to let Big Brother into the act!"
1,Screen is messed up after one year!,"To be frankly, I didn't use it very intensively. But from several weeks ago, the screen was messed up and I can only see several scratches of lines on the screen. The quality is so bad and I won't buy kindle any more. iPad should be a better choice for me."
5,Wireless Kindle makes for good reading,"This is a great ebook, fantastic to download books or just newspapers from a menu, could not be easier. Arrived very quickly and fully ocnfigured as promised. Fantastic to read, and so light, cetainly more than a book. Hoping this saves having lots of books at home storing on the shelf.The pages are easy on the eye and battery has lasted over 3 weeks before needing recharging. Also links to the iPhone for a few ages."
4,The Kindle Experience,It is mainly for my wife & it is a learning experience at present. We're still trying to get comfortable with it. It is a convenient size & quite portable
4,"Love it, love it, love it","I LOVE the kindle! It is the greatest thing since sliced bread - except for one one little thing..... I really do wish it had an optional back light so that I could read on an dark airplane without having to have a reading light on - or in bed, etc.... Otherwise it is perfect!"
3,Text to Speech Function,"I love my Kindle except I'm really disappointed that the ""text to speech"" function is disabled on so many books. Part of the reason I bought the Kindle was for this feature. I realize that many of the authors have said ""No"" to allowing this feature and I think that Amazon should keep an on-going discussion with authors and work to convince them to allow this feature. Authors - I would buy more of your books if you allowed for the text-to-speech option because there are many times and circumstances where this feature is the difference between ""reading"" or doing something else. With the feature enabled ... I can do both."
5,I love to read!,I love to read and the Kindle is perfect. I can carry it with me in my purse everywhere. It is just right when I travel or go to the beach. I love it.
4,"Solid peformance, great future promise",Performs basic buying of books and reading very well. Search feature is snappy and a definite advantage over paper books. Book selection is good and getting better every day. To top it off prices are competitive and less than what you would pay for paper books which is the way it should be (unlike digital movie downloads that can cost more than DVDs).Looking forward to improvements in the web browser over time so reading blogs with an rss reader like Google reader will work faster.Would also like to see the web browser do a better job with services like Remember the Milk (to-do list site) and Anki (flash card memory site) since we have that great persistent wireless data connection. Eventually it would be great to easily clip information from books to Anki for important points you want to memorize.Overall quite happy with the device and service and looking forward to improvements in the browser over time as new firmware comes out.
5,Kindle,"Fantastic move into new age technology. I held out for a long time, but now I am certainly hooked. I will have difficulty picking up a book now."
3,Kindle some what dissapponted,"I purchased a Kindle for my wife's birthday, because she loves to read, espically old books. To my supprise much of the old books she wanted, to Kill a Mockingbrid, could not be found. This did not make me happy. I just spent $500.00 on some thing for her birthday, and the first two books we tried to find could not. Unit work fine, just cannot find the books needed. A little mis-leading."
4,Competition Reads Free Library Books,"Kindle's competition has to ability to read other electronic files such as what you can check out at the library. If you buy a kindle, it works wonderfully except you need to pay for all your books. Gone is the day of free library check out. If you purchase the Kindle's competitors, however you can still check out free electronic formats thru your local library."
1,Waste of Money,"This thing is a joke. It will not connect via the wireless option so I was not able to download the books I purchased. I then connected it to my pc and attempted to download my books via that connection. While it appeared it downloaded the book, when I attempted to read either book, the only thing on the screen was a warning dialog that said ""Unexpected Error"".So I have spent nearly $350 all told and have absolutely nothing to show for it other then possibly using the Kindle for a mouse pad."
1,NEVER buy one of these becasue they can delete your books,"At least when I buy a paper book, I own it. But when I buy an eBook on a Kindle - who knows? They can come in and delete it at any time."
1,Closed platform!,"Kindle 2 is a great piece of engineering. It is aesthetically pleasing, works wonderfully, and is durable. The problem is it's content.Users need to know - just like for a long time the only place your could legally buy music for your ipod was the itunes store (leading apple to dominate the market to this day), for kindle, the only place you can legally buy most e-books is from amazon!It's not like this for all e-book readers. The sony reader, for instance, is an open platform, enabling booksellers anywhere to sell books for it. Amazon is trying to corner the market for ebooks early in the game using the apple business model, and YOU, THE USER, SHOULD NOT LET IT HAPPEN.The future is ebooks, like it or not, and if amazon is the only one that can sell them, that means that every small bookseller is out of business. Just think of all the music stores in your town that have closed because of mp3's.DEMAND THAT AMAZON MAKE THE KINDLE AN OPEN PLATFORM! or buy the sony reader instead."
1,Usless rubbish to clutter up your life,Why would you buy something that needs batteries to read books?Why would you buy something that costs $300 to read a $3 paperback?Why would you pay and buy a book only to have amazon delete it from your kindle?This is useless rubbish for people with too much money and not much sense.Think how much food and clean water you can buy for some starving child with this money.
1,This device is fragile and Amazon does not support it at all!,"The device is VERY fragile! Mine broke after putting it in a laptop bag and just carried it around and I have no idea how the screen cracked. Amazon DOES NOT CARE about any cracked screen and will not even discuss the issue with me. Horrible customer support. Arrogant and rude on the phone.Also, when you buy a real book you Own it and can lend it to other people and donate it to a school or hospital. Not so with a ebook. For example the Lost Symbol is $16.00 for the book and $10.00 for the Kindle book. You only save $6 and that is for a book no one else can read and no one else can borrow. And the Kindle costs $250. If you save $6 per book then you could buy 41 books before you pay for the Kindle. And if the kindle screen breaks before you buy 41 books then you are in the hole already.And magazines on it are a bigger ripoff!"
1,The Kindle should drop DRM and support software freedom,"Dear Jeff Bezos,Don't push proprietary software on society. Instead, encourage Amazon to drop DRM and align itself with freedom. Your deletion of Orwell's 1984 should be a wake-up call.Jeff, please take responsibility for the harm the Kindle might inflict upon society if it remains a proprietary and untrustworthy device.peterbFree Software Foundation"
5,Turn the page,"My new kindle is really nice, easy to hold and easy to read. This thing is so book like, I keep trying to turn the page rather than push the next page button. The internet is pretty basic but having a free 3g connection is really nice. I do quite a bit of traveling in Europe, but refuse to pay the outrageous roaming charges for data, so this is quite a bonus. Overall the Kindle is an excellent value."
5,great buy,"I just love the Kindle! I started using it as soon as I got it. Books seem to be cheaper then regular hard backs with classics free. The screen is easy to read and there is no sun glare when in direct sunlight. Only drawback, if reading at night, need a book light or a lamp. Have started recommonding this to my friends."
3,Watch what you buy,"I like the Kindle, but don't love it. I have ordered a couple books that have charts printed smaller than the normal book print and cannot read them- even on the largest type setting. Part of the problem is the grayscale doesnt permit enough contrast on the small print. I can see this would be a big problem with any textbook application. I am also a browser-- like to leaf through books at random which is nearly impossible with the Kindle. I do like the portability- I like to travel with books and this will make my luggage lots lighter, and it is good for beach reading. Still getting used to not having the paper in my hands!"
1,drm,"The DRM on this is annoying. I buy a book and I don't like it, I sell it. I buy a eBook and I have to sell the kindle. I want to share a good book, I let my friends borrow the book. I want to share a eBook, I share the kindle and lose it. I don't like the possibility of my books being deleted."
5,I wish I would have invented this!!!,"Easy to use, easy to download books, easier than lugging 4 books while on vacation."
4,"9.7"" is better for me","this is great one. but 9.7"" is better for me.i returned it, bought 9.7"" again."
3,RECREATE THE KINDLE FOR LOW VISION READERS!,I am the mother of a low-vision child who loves to read. The gray on gray contrast of the Kindle is hard for her to see. If the Kindle had a white background with black letters this would create a greater contrast. A 24 size font is ideal for her. I hope Kindle thinks of what an amazing tool their product could be for visuallly impared people and seniors who have lost their site to macular degeneration.
3,Preexisting eye floaters and the Kindle 2,"I really looked forward to receiving the Kindle 2. Unfortunately, after I began reading on it, I experienced pretty significant eye strain in my left eye where I have 'floaters' -- black spots which float through the field of vision. I've had them for many years. I don't have as many in my right eye and did not experience eye strain in that eye when reading on the Kindle. It appears that the combination of the gray background on the Kindle and the floaters in my left eye caused the strain. So, the product was returned and I'm back reading books on paper.If I didn't have the floaters I would have spent a lot of time with the Kindle -- an amazing device."
3,Review of Kindle 2 and cover,"I love the Kindle 2. Its everything advertised and more....Its comfortable to hold and easy to read.The ""leather"" cover is another story. Its cheap leather. At $30.00 its a rip off. The first one arrived damaged in two places on the back. Amazon quickly send a replacement,which arrived damaged in two places on the front cover. That one was returned. Since I am now traveling and wanted protection for the Kindle I kept the original, with the 2 marks on the back cover. Both covers probably would have been fine if the leather was a better quality and the Amazon packaging was better when the covers were sent. So its 5 stars for the Kindle 2. Maybe two stars for the cover since it does protect the screen and holds the Kindle 2 safely."
1,BAIT AND SWITCH!!!!! BEWARE !!!!,"Kindle screen froze and Amazon sent a clearly NOT new kindle to me overnight. NOT NEW.Refurbished.Clearly.they call it a 'replacement' but it's not. mine was in pristine condition!And because i had the item over 30 days, (55) they said it's within their rights!!I loved my old (practically brand new) kindle. but beware -- if your kindle freezes and they have to replace it, and more than 30 days have passed since you bought it, you're in trouble!"
1,Kindle should be renamed Brittle,"Really disappointed in the Kindle. I got it as a gift for my wife who is a big reader. She had it for about 2 weeks when she pulled it out of her bag and found the screen to be broken. It was not subjected to any drops or anything like that. In fact, it was next to her iPhone which she has had for a year with no problems. Our option is to send it in and they will fix it for $200. Still debating whether I want to spend more money on it. Disappointed that they couldn't develop a more durable screen."
5,greastest invention ever,I like to read and to carry a book was hard I'm 75 and take and pick up my godchild from school and read while I wait and the Kindle is the greatest thing so light and compact and you never have to run out of books. I keep my next book on hold till I finish one and then I can go right on to the next one. THANK YOU FOR SUCH A GREAT INVENTION.Dolores M Johnson
4,Great With One Exception,"I think this e-reader is great with one exception - the noisy navigation keys, especially the 'next page' keys. If one reads in bed, as I do with someone else trying to sleep or just in any quiet room, the clicking noise the keys make are very disturbing. Silence the keys and swap the new one for my clicking one."
3,Two Kindles - Two Screens Gone Bad,"I was an original Kindle user - ordered even before it was on the cover of Newsweek Magazine. While I love the Kindle when it works, the screen seems to be very sensitive. I turn it off. Set it aside. Turn it back on and the screen is shot. First one was within warranty so they replaced it and Customer Service was very nice. Second one was within a year outside of warranty, but they refused to replace it or give me a discount or any assistance at all. Clearly, the Kindle is more popular and the original customers are not quite as important. I'm now evaluating the Sony Reader, now that it has wireless and can download library books. The wireless was always the differentiating feature for me. Love the Kindle, but get the screen issue fixed. I know I'm not the only one..."
3,Limited availability of books a problem,"My wife and I each have a Kindle (one original and one Kindle 2). For the most part we are happy with them except for one big problem. About half of the books I want to read are not available on the Kindle. I'm not talking about obscure books. These are featured in Barnes and Nobel, NY Times book review, local book reviews, etc., frequently on the best seller lists. I consider this a serious limitation. Is it caused by copyright issues with the publishers or Amazon's lack of resources applied to getting new books prepared for Kindle or something else? I don't know but it sure is frustrating."
2,My Kindle in Italy,I bought my kindle to take on a 10 day trip to Italy. It was great to have more books along than I could read. I love its size and low weight. And the ability to change font size when the light was bad.
1,Screen Problems,"I love the product, but have had to return 2 of them due to the screen failing. This defect needs to be corrected in the next generation of the product so that it travels better and is more versatile."
5,Our 2nd Kindle and Love It!,"We purchased our first Kindle (a DL) last August and loved it from the start. In addition to the on-line book purchases, we love the web browser capability especially while traveling. In order to keep both members of the household happy, we now have purchased the 6"" Kindle. It is certainly more compact than our original purchase but meets our needs perfectly. We have made numerous referrals to our neighbors."
4,My new baby,"I love my new kindle 2 just like it is a new born baby. I have purchased a the M=Edge to protect it, a silcone skin to protect it and to change outfits, and a reversible sleeve. I purchasaed a very pretty adhesive skin for it to make it look pretty and the colors of the skin and the M-edge complement one another. I have also purchased the light, and other accessories. I feel as if my new baby arrived and I have prepared for it to come home. It is very user friendly especially during my daily commute on NYC subways. The battery life is amazing especially when the wireless is turned off.LOVE IT"
5,Best Purchase Ever,"I love my Kindle. Book space is no longer a storage issue. I can download a book in seconds...no wait time. You can also order a sample of a book for free before purchasing to see if you want to purchase it BEFORE buying it (also it takes just a few seconds to download). I already ordered all my books from Amazon before. No shipping costs anymore. Huge cost savings and I can ""carry"" all my books on one small device. I really hope more magazines will be available though as I enjoy reading magazines, too. I purchased a great leather cover for my Kindle at a reasonable price right here on amazon.com. You really cannot go wrong. It is extremely user friendly and you do not have to be tech savvy at all to use it. The screen is sharp and clear, nothing like a computer screen. Recommend to anyone thinking of purchasing. I see they have the newer version at a lower price now. Love the dictionary and ability to highlight also."
5,kindle 2,I absolutely love the kindle. I believe I can read even faster with the kindle than I can with a hardcover book. I love the look and lightweight feeling of the kindle also. I tell all my friends and relatives how great this little kindle is.
2,Very fragile product,"My kindle worked fine for about 9 months then it completely stopped working after the second time it went through the x-ray machines at the airport in Paris. The device is supposed to handle x-ray machines just fine. Since it was under warranty, Amazon sent me a replacement, which was of course, refurbished. This one has not worked consistently at all. It constantly freezes up. When I called Amazon to report this problem, I was told to restart it. Once I did, it worked for another couple of days and now I can't go one day without having to restart it, which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. When it does restart, it loses my page. For as much money as Amazon charges for the kindle, I would expect much fewer issues."
3,Don't drop it!,"The device itself is amazing! However, it is somewhat delicate. I bought the patagonia case as soon as I received my kindle. It slipped out, 45 days after I purchased it, and the screen cracked. Amazon will give you a new or refurbished one for about half of what it costs for a new one. But assuming I break one of these every 45 days, I think I'm in big trouble. . .Be very careful.PJS"
3,Delightful experience,I owned Kindle 2 for a week now and I must say that I am impressed. I can at last read e-books while seating by the pool!
5,New owner loves it!,"I'll just add my two cents. I bought the Nook and returned it after a day. I bought a Sony Reader and returned it after a week. The Kindle is not going back.Sincerely,Phillip Dubov"
4,Love my Kindle!,I love my kindle!Things I love: It was shipped very quickly...easy to use...so many books available at my fingertips...very easy to read...charge lasts a long time...easy to order new books...good prices on books...love managing my kindle on my PC.Things I hope for the future: More magazine options (not enough womens magazines such as Oprah and craft magazines)...more freebies...I was not impressed with the cover choices- I had to have one made...wish I could get on the internet- there is a keyboard after all!
5,Constant Companion,"I am very seldom without my Kindle. I like to read in bed and have found over the years that the books get too heavy, and the Kindle is so light weight. I also am delighted with taking it with me to the doctor's office, as you know, your appointment is likely not on time. You don't even notice the time slipping by if you are reading a good book."
4,Two Things,"I love my Kindle. It is light, convienient and I love being able to download anywhere any time. I have two complaints. One of the reasons I purchased my kindle was to assist my children who both have reading disibilities. That is where the text-to-speach comes in. (This is great) I am however disapointed in how many of the books do not have this enabled..especially in the way of boys books. I would also like to see the text highlighted as it is read. There is research now that proves highlighted speach to text can assist non readers learn to read. This would probably increase your customer base as 20% of the population has a reading disibility. Most of these people are of normal or gifted intelligence. Now after six months I have one more suggestion some sort of back lighting would be a great idea so I can read it anywhere anytime."
4,review,"i read a lot before buying it about different models of e-readers and decided Kindle was the best, I wasn't desaponinted at all, on the contrary, I'm still amazed.I tried the e-shopping and was delivered instantly.I'm not at all satisfied with different conversions of files for my Kindle I've done but that's also my fault. Ipm looking forward for an online conversion utility.Bye"
4,"great, except for the stupid connector","Amazon, why couldn't you use a standard Mini-USB connector like everybody else? Now whenever I travel I have to pack a special Micro-USB cable JUST for my kindle. So lame!"
3,My Kindle Review,"Your advertisement for the Kindle is correct, it is an amazing device. That books and subscriptions can be ordered so easily and that so many different books can be carried around is such a compact form is eye-opening. Its controls are easy to learn and to use, its dictionary is a snap to employ and the font size adjustment is impressive.So why only three stars? It is not the fault of the Kindle that a pleasant looking well laid-out page cannot remain readable when forced to fit on its screen, but charts, graphs, tables and diagrams are necessay when understanding technical books. And pictures are important to me in subscriptions. Consequently, my Kindle must be devoted to the reading of non-technical materials only.Will Cowan"
3,Reselling books,"I will be very interested in the Kindle when I have the ability to re-sell the books I have read. I read a lot of books and I either pass them on to friends or sell them. There is no way to do this with books loaded on a Kindle. With the initial cost so high and the inability to re-sell the books, I will have to keep reading the paper ones."
4,Genius,"I do love my Kindle. It is so convenient and efficient! I haven't got a case yet, so it hasn't left the house and I can't read it around my son because he is just too curious, poking at it and stuff. But it's all fine. I really enjoy the ease of use. And I can read it for HOURS without my eyes getting tired! I would absolutely recommend this product to dedicated readers and even the occasional ones. It is fantastic. Only four stars because of a MINOR flaw or two, but all-in-all - GREAT investment."
2,still too expensive,"The i-pad can perform many more functions than the Kindle and is still only a few hundred dollars more. If you reduced the Kindle price down to $150.00, I think it would sell better and be worth the purchase."
1,Wow factor missing for the price,"Received as a gift and couldn't return.I really tried to love it but with the new technology around it's equivalent to a B&W; TV! For all the bells and whistles, it's dated. Font is small, locked into Amazon unless you want to hunt & nav through other channels. In all, an Expensive One Trick Pony."
1,Don't know,"I ordered this unit as a gift. What a fiasco! Had to give out my yahoo password to receipiant so she could reregister her Kindle. And this is after I already unregistered it from my Amazaon account. The ordering process needs improvement here. As far as the actual unit goes, this request for a review should have gone to the person who owns it! ARG!"
1,Not a review but a question,"Have long wanted a kindle as my home is a mega book facility. However, I have heard that one cannot add a product from a non-amazon source. Is this so???Thank you, Nita Jones"
1,Kindle a major disappointment as travel tool,"I bought the Kindle for my husband because we were taking a long trip overseas and I didn't want to run out of reading material. It was a major disappointment that we could not connect online overseas to download material we purchased while traveling-- and we tried several times in places with free wifi. We were able to purchase materials on a computer, but kept getting ""unable to connect at this time"" and the device never downloaded the books and everything we bought was a complete waste. The whole reason we got the Kindle was for this trip and it was a total waste of money."
5,Perfect for people with Book Acquisition Disease,"Some people probably walk into bookstores and buy one book, which they read completely before returning and buying one more book. Some people probably never have library fines. I am not one of those people.I'm the type that can't leave a bookstore without an armload of books. Used bookstores are even worse, and my ""books to read someday"" pile can get pretty big.Enter Kindle. The best button in the built-in store menu is ""save for later."" Now I can not only sample a generous portion of each book, I can defer paying for it until I'm actually ready to read it. Then I just scan my ""saved for later"" folder and pay for a book at the moment I'm actually going to read it.So if you suffer from B.A.D. (Book Acquisition Disease) as I do, do yourself a favor and get yourself a Kindle. It will pay for itself pretty quickly."
3,Getting there,I have owned a 2nd Generation Kindle for almost a year. I have been happy with the reading experience and I find it a great way to read periodicals while traveling.However when it comes to books it takes away the more social aspects of reading - gifting and sharing. That is there is no way to purchase a kindle edition book for a friend - you can only send them a generic gift certificate. And there is no way to share a book you have purchased with other kindle owners the way you would lend a book to a friend. You'd have to give them your kindle.
3,Disappointed,"Got my Kindle 2 yesterday. I really enjoy it; however, the one I got has some issues, and Amazon cannot resolve them!1. After I pressed ""enter"" to read more explaination in the dictionary, I can't go back to the page of the book I was reading with ""BACK"". I can only press ""HOME"" and select the book again to read.2. I cannot close the notes tab or press ""BACK"" to go back to the page directly. I also had to go to HOME first then re-select the book.The issues don't happen all the time. After I turned it off and then on again, the issues would go away for a while until next time it happens again. It has already happened three time since yesterday after I got it.I called the Kindle Support and was told that they have never heard these problems.They just asked me to reboot, and nothing else can be done.Feeling pretty disappointed now...:("
3,4th Kindle,"Do not like the five button replacement for the stalk, like the longer battery life and smaller size, like the placement of the home button near the menu and the back and forward page turn buttons on both sides. Miss the numbers."
5,Amazon Kindle,"I was reluctant to purchase the Amazon Kindle. It was a lot of money and I had heard some horror stories about these E-Books. However I took a chance and I am most happy that I did. It is amazingly simple to use and ordering books is a snap. The only objection I have is occasionally the price of an e-book is higher than a paperback book, especially one from Wal-Mart. Outside of that I thoroughly enjoy my Kindle. I have read 4 novels so far and have been extremely happy with the ease of reading. I can enlarge the type so I can read without my glasses and narrow the number of words per line making reading faster than with a standard book. The selection of books is very large and I have had no problem with finding different books by different authors.Kindle 3G Wireless Reading Device, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 6"" Display, Graphite, 3G Works Globally - Latest Generation"
2,Amazon bowing to pressure,"Kindle 2: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)This is a great product, especially for those who face disabilities which interfere with seeing the page or turning the page and holding the book/paper. But, be forewarned that Amazon is bowing to pressure from the Writers Guild to allow writers and publishers to disable the ""text to speech"" feature on books in flagrant disregard to equal access for persons with disabilities. Tell Amazon that you have serious misgivings about buying this product if the user is impaired and won't have the same access to published materials that non-impaired Kindle 2 users have !!!!!!!!!"
1,Buyer Beware,"The concept of this device is wonderful!! My daughter got one for her birthday and used it daily. It was a great way to get her into reading more. However...I would really do research into other devices like this. The Nook as an example. If you look online you will find many ppl have the same problem we started having with our Kindle. The screen becomes black at the top of the screen with lines across it. It eventually works down the screen. Our Kindle has about the top third completely white with black lines now. It makes for very difficult reading. She is in high school and has summer reading assignments that she will have to purchase actual books to read now. I totally feel like I have wasted 300 dollars and in this economy, spending another 89.99 on a refurbished replacement for something that is clearly defective just not appeal to me. I will do research on other units."
1,BEWARE OF WARRANTY ISSUE,"If you buy a Kindle 2 you should beware of what they do if you have warranty issue. They replace your Kindle with a refirbished one. Paid 259 for my Kindle. Now it has a major electronic issue and they are replacing it with a REFIRBISHED Kindle. They call it a ""highly tested unit"". What a joke. If a new item breaks it should be replaced with a new item. Period. Could not even get the customer service rep to let me talk to a supervisor. Rotten deal BEWARE!!!"
2,Misleading pricing of Kindle books,"I have had my Kindle for several months and am perfectly happy with it, with one exception: The sales pitch is ""buy most books for $9.99."" This is true UNLESS it is a very popular author and/or a new release. Today in my email from Amazon is a new book of James Patterson and the Kindle price is .16 cents MORE than the hardback. This has been true for about half of the new releases and I am very disappointed. I will go back to my bookshelf until the prices come down, hopefully when they are no longer new releases. Meanwhile, I will call Amazon and register my complaint. Maybe it will help - maybe not."
1,BIG disappointment,"I was very excited to buy my kindle and even purchased three books to be on it when it arrived. The unit came on just fine but I could not see any of the content I purchased, even though I had paid for it. I called the help number and spoke to a very nice man who tried for over an hour but did not know how to fix it. He said he would have some ""development people look into it"" but I have not heard anything. While I was waiting for the man to help me, I was reading the book that I had already started. It made me wonder why I was bothering. In any case, it was disappointing because I fell for the advertisement about it being simple and easy but it was nothing of the sort. They need to make help more available and they need to respond much more quickly to people who have problems or they will lose a lot of business."
1,Too Outdated,"I feel that this product is too outdated. Currently there are cell phones that are touch screen, and the keyboard is on that touch screen. (such as the 'Dare'. So why does the Kindle have to have actual buttons? This device also is in black & white. During the 1900s television was in black & white, we have moved on into the 21st century! We have color Tv's now! The Kindle needs to have color, especially for using the web browser. There are many other features that can be added to this electronic such as a camera, touch screen, adding a stylus to write with, etc. I think that Amazon should takes these ideas into consideration for their new Kindle 3."
1,Extremely Limited Selection Of Fiction Books,"Despite Amazon's misleading claims of a huge selection from which to chose when it comes to books, I found maybe 3 or 4 listed with authors I recognized and with titles I would chose to read. The rest are divided among non-fiction; self-help; business, etc. I am sure that technically Kindle is quite satisfactory - I wouldn't know since I returned it unopened, after I perused the book selections. My feeling was what good is the best television, if there are no decent programs to watch on it and, similarly, what good is a state-of-the-art reader, if there are no books to read on it? Amazon, I am surprised at your duplicity."
1,"Hardware good, software too expensive","All of the hardware reviews of this device are great. I read free (public domain) ebooks regularly on my smartphone, and would love to own a Kindle for more conemporary book choices and larger screen. But as long as Amazon is selling ebooks for as much, or more, than paperbacks, forget it. With ZERO materials and shipping costs, I can't see any reason to pay more than a couple of bucks for an ebook. There is a price point that will tip ebooks into the main stream, just like 99c per song did for music. But $9.99 for an ebook isn't that price. Drop that down, and you'll have me as a customer."
3,Punish the customers,"First, I love my Kindle. However, the recent price drops is infuriating. Thousands of loyal Amazon customers are getting a raw deal.Amazon knows who we are and as a courtesy should offer free books, Amazon gift certificates or some option so we are not being punished. I would have a very hard time recommending the purchase of a Kindle now, it is far better to wait until the next price cutI would recommend using a Kindle, but not purchasing one at this time"
2,Really dissappointed,"I bought the Kindle for my wife as a present after seeing it touted on Oprah. My wife loved it with the exception of some things that still needed to be worked out with it. Now, I've learned of a new and improved Kindle, with changes that I told Amazon about as soon as I received it. I was dissappointed to find out that I could not return the Kindle 1, with the ""bugs"", for the more improved version. So, I wanted people to know that when you purchase a proprietary item from a company, in this case Amazon, be sure and wait long enough until all the ""bugs"" are worked out with it first. Or, better yet, if you notice anything that needs to be put into the development of it, return it and then wait for those changes before purchasing."
2,Text to Speech Disabled?,"My wife was considering ordering me a kindle 2, but I just read that Amazon will be enabling authors to turn off the ability of the kindle to read books aloud. I have poor vision and this feature was one of the primary reasons my wife was going to get a kindle for me. We are now re-thinking that decison. If we do decide to purchase a kindle, I can say absolutely that I will never purchase any book for the kindle that has the text to speech feature disabled. I am only one person, but perhaps if others feel strongly about this and let their concerns be known to Amazon,we can stop this from actually ocurring."
1,POOF - dead after 18 months and no hope from Amazon,After 18 months of loving this thing it died - poof - no warning - no accidents - poof - halfway thru good book - poof - died.Called AMazon and to make long story short they will notify me of the price for a refurbished model in the next two weeks. That's it - two weeks before i will know how much more money I have to pay - and the time lost - no money for that. Looking at other options. You should also.
2,THE DOWNSIDE TO THIS WHOLE CONCEPT,"Okay, first, I don't like the idea of paying $10.00 (about two-thirds the book price at ""Costco"") for a virtual book, that once read, is useless to me. Who cares if it can be stored in memory, I don't want to read it again. Not being an actual book, I can't display it on a bookshelf, I can't lend it to a friend to read, I can't sell it back to a Used Book Store, or donate it to a School or Library. It seems to me, that $1.00 a book would be much more reasonable, like downloading a song from iTunes. What would make much more sense, would be to run this service like ""Netflix"", whereby you subscribe to a monthly service, download one book at a time to read, then when finished, send it back electronically, while uploading another. Much the same way it's done with movies downloaded to your computer. Merely choose from a list of book titles and reviews of books, found on-line. This to me, would be a far better way of doing it."
1,Don't buy--the warranty is bogus!,Do not buy this product! I have two Kindles. On one Kindle the screen developed problems--Amazon does not stand behind the product. I've had it less than three months and now have to pay a $200 fee to have it fixed. This is a HUGE rip-off!!!!!
2,Not worth it,"I bought a Kindle I a couple of months ago --got a deal- after the Kindle IIs came out. Then I sent it back and bought a Kindle II. I sent it back too after about a week of comparing it to Sony's Ebook. Over the last several months, I tried all three.The Kindle I is more solid and works better; however, the II is more supported, etc. The bottom line is that the Sony is slightly better with its back lights, solid construction, etc.Even more frustrating, is that the next generations are almost here with COLOR and other enhancements. I would hate to invest now and in a few months could have had a better unit.(I even sent the Sony back too and decided to just wait a couple of months)My bottom, bottom line is that I will wait; the market will change drastically in a couple of months and the competition from B&N;, etc., will drive the prices down, too."
1,Spoiled by Digital Restrictions Management,"Kindle is fettered by DRM (Digital Restrictions Management) -- a set of restrictions designed to control when, how, and what you can use it for. Read the reviews and see how much time and money this has cost other users who cannot restore backups of content they have lawfully purchased. This is only the tip of the digital iceberg. The ethical choice is to insist on a device that is free of restrictions, which runs Free Software that's under your control, with content that is similarly free of DRM. Amazon has done it with their DRM-free music downloads, why not with ebooks?"
5,Review for Kindle,I love this product!The only thing that would improve it would be a built in back light for reading in dark areas.
4,Kindle 2 and Travel,"I broke down to get the Kindle 2 as I travel weekly, airplanes mostly. It's great to be able to read and have so many books available without all the luggage room. My first accessory purchase was to get a HandStands.com leather grain sticky pad for the back of the Kindle. My biggest issue is the slick back surface of the Kindle 2 and it's ability to basically do the ""luge"" without notice. This helped alot and now I can grab the Kindle 2 better, lay it down and move around without wondering where it went when I get back. Why didn't they make the back of this so sleek?"
4,"It's worth it to overcome your fear of ""not holding an actual book in your hands""","When you have a Kindle you get used to people stopping you all the time to say, ""wow, how do you like it?"" The most common comment/question after that is, ""I couldn't give up my books."" I felt the same way ... even after buying the Kindle my plan was to use it for newspapers and copies of business and reference books I use often.I have found, however, that the ability to search, highlight, and copy text in the books I buy is a game-changing experience. I think you'll feel the same way."
5,The Kindle A Joy to Have IF Yu Enjoy Reading,"This is the best invention since sliced bread. It's very easy to use and as soon as yu receive it you are able to get started and read your first book. The step by step directions are included with your kindle and it's very easy to download a book etc. from the Amazon Kindle Store. Best of all yu read faster and read more books with this little beauty. You can also make the text as large or small as you want to your liking. The print is crystal clear and yu can even go outside to a park, beach or outside your house to read. I highly recommend this piece of technology to all who love to pick up a good book once in a while or a magazine,or newspaper."
5,Kindle 2 Review,I have thoroughly enjoyed my Kindle and may never buy another hardback or paperback book again!!! It is small enough to fit in a purse/bag but still large enough to see the screen. There are so many options that I haven't even used them all. They make it very easy and quick to order and download materials too. I would recommend this for any reader.
4,Kindle 2 a great machine but very fragile,"Don't take your Kindle 2 to the gym because if it falls off the elliptical trainer it is toast! And Amazon is not set up to fix them. They give you ""a deal"" so that you can buy a new one at $200.00 plus shipping and then they charge you a ""restocking fee"" on the broken item that is not fixable. So instead of $350 you end up paying about $300.However, you want to replace it, as it is such an amazing item and if you love to read, it's worth it."
4,My Kindle 2,"I am really enjoying My Kindle 2. I love the freedom that I have to download books at anytime, have so many books on my device at one time and to enjoy reading outside on a sunny day since the screen is so easy to read. The other great feature is that I am not carrying around heavy books which will hurt my wrists over time.My concern is that my on/off switch is not working properly so my battery is running down sooner than expected. I have learned to be patient as my device may have to reboot up to 4 times before it will turn off. This is really annoying and unacceptable to me. Overall, I am very pleased and I am reading for longer periods of time since this is so light weight."
5,Now an everyday reader,"Grant it, the Kindle does not have the bells and whistles of the Ipad. But that's never been what it set out to do. This is simply the best ereader available. It doesn't need to be anything else.Truth be told, I would read less than 1 book per year before I bought a Kindle. Now I average about a book per month. This is one of the best investments I've ever made."
5,suggestions,I wish that I would have been upgraded to the latest version. I am hoping that kindle comes out with a back light. It would make a great add on for late night readers such as myself. I love the kindle. All school should go green with the kindle.
1,Price Cut So Soon?,"I love my kindle, no doubt. I am just so disappointed that barely 10 months after I bought the Kindle 2, the price has dropped about $100, almost 30%. I understand that electronics become obsolete and older versions really go 'on sale'....but 10 months? The IPOD can maintain their pricing and still launch new products..."
2,NEEDS A BACKLIT SCREEN,WE NEVER BOTHERED TO USE THE PRODUCT BECAUSE WE LEARNED AFTER ORDERING IT THAT NONE OF AMAZON'S KINDLE'S HAVE BACKLIT SCREENS.WE READ A NEWSPAPER REVIEW SAYING ANOTHER RECENTLY INTRODUCED BRAND DOES HAVE A BACKLIGHT SO WE WILL ORDER IT INSTEAD OF THE KINDLE.
3,Kindle is great - keyboard is bad - lack of books bad,"I love reading books on my kindle. I think it's great, but the keyboard was a waste of real estate. This could have been made smaller or omitted (since I seldom if every use it) and provide more room for a full paper back page size screen. Lame attempt at a web device Amazon!I also need you to keep pressure on the publisher to get more titles on the kindle. Too many of my favorite authors have spotty coverage."
2,Original Kindle owners lose services,"If you live in rural areas not covered by whispernet, then you know kindle has taken away sample book services. I used to be able to download free samples of books I might be interested in reading to my computer then transfer to my kindle since whispernet is not provided in my area. NOW kindle decided the sample books are ONLY available via whispernet. So now, my choice is to purchase the book without review. They do bring it to your attention that you can certainly BUY a NEW kindle--Gee thanks, my first one cost enough!!"
4,Kindle Book Reader,"Works well for downloaded books. It does have some typographical errors, (incomplete letters). I haven't used all of its functions. I just use it for reading books. Graphics such as scanned documents in the book are too small to read. Overall a good product."
5,LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT,"I absolutely LOVE my Kindle! I have it with me everywhere I go and have not had a single problem downloading books. It is a great conversation piece as well. I have been stopped numerous times being asked what it is and how do I like it! Best of all, I am no longer ""book poor"", the costs of downloading a book versus going to the bookstore is huge! Thanks Amazon for my new ""girls best friend""."
4,Love my Kindle,"I was unsure how I would feel about reading about electronically. Let's say that it turned out being much better than I imagined. The feeling of having a virtual library at my instantaneous disposal is very enpowering!My only reservation is that the kindle is not capable of either color or, more importantly, pictures. I have tried a trial subscription to the newspaper but I am still unsure if I want to give up the concept of pictures. Also, if I were to read a biography, for example, I would probably still buy the book because I like to look at the pictures.Otherwise, it is great!"
4,Kindle Review,I really enjoy this device. Beta text to voice feature is weak and I look forward to upgrades to the monotone - computer generated voice. The scroll to dictionary function is great.I would like to see a better way to categorize books in the library. For example - when reading a series - it would be beneficial to have the ability to group them together.
5,The gift that keeps on giving!,I purchased the Kindle2 for a birthday gift and I think it was one of the best received gifts I have ever given. The Kindle2 is a constant companion to the person I purchased it for and this makes me very happy.
5,I Forgot I Was Waiting to See the Doctor,"My name is Victoria. my Kindle2 was an anniversary gift from my husband. I started getting acquainted with it on Saturday April 25, 2009. I was so excited I telephoned a friend in Cape Cod and told her to buy one for her husband who is an avid reader.I had a routine MD appointment today. While waiting, which I do not like to do in a doctor's office, I read the Wall Street Journal on my Kindle. When my name was called, I was reading and had forgotten where I was. I went to the exam room to wait for the doctor. I continued reading. When he entered, he said, ""I just got one of those"" and asked me to show him how to order books, which I did.I am thrilled to have this instrument. Thank you, Amazon, for its creation. It is definitely revolutionary. I think you are going to sell millions of them!!"
1,Do NOT Buy!,"When I purchased my Kindle in April I was a little uneasy about the whole DRM concept and the vagueness of the user agreement. Then Amazon promptly engaged in a classic bait and switch, raising the monthly cost of a Wall Street Journal subscription by 50%. Now Amazon is remotely raiding our Kindles! Why would I EVER ""purchase"" another title? How can any Kindle owner have any confidence that his or her purchase is safe and/or valid? Now I just have to accept the fact that I'm stuck with a $400 paperweight. Nice job, Amazon."
1,Willl Not Buy!,"I would have given this device zero stars if that were an option. After hearing that Amazon can and does delete books that have already been purchased, I have decided not to buy the Kindle. It doesn't matter how good the technology is if it takes away our rights and freedoms. Shame on you, Amazon!"
5,actually worth it,I dont read as much as many and only decided to buy one after playing with a friends. I do not regret it at all. The dictionary comes in handy when reading older litaratuer with old slang. After playing with mine my mother decided she wanted one and we got one for her birthday. She uses hers daily (she likes to read before she goes to bed). Neither one of us have ever had a problem with either.
1,Very poor service,"When my Kindle worked, I loved it, but since a product is only as good as the back-up service, I have to give Amazon only 1 star. I'd give it less if it were possible.My five month old Kindle crashed. After two phone calls and speaking to four people, the bottom line is that I will be getting a refurbished Kindle with no history as to why the unit was sent back to Amazon and only the remainder of my warranty (until December 25, 2009).I checked their warranty and it is Amazon's 'option' to do one of three things: replace the unit with a new or refurbished one; repair it; or refund my money. I've been told by two service reps that they have been given hardline orders from their ""business team"" that they are only allowed to replace with refurbished units.In my opinion their warranty is misleading. It speaks of options that Amazon is not willing to take.I am a very unhappy customer and will no longer spend money with these folks."
3,bad replacement policy,"I love my kindle and happily sang its praises when anyone asked - I don't like Amazon too much. OK, so they didn't lie and it's all there in plain print in the warranty, and I didn't read it.My kindle froze and died and Amazon quickly sent a replacement - but it's not a new one and the warranty says it can be a refurbished one. That doesn't make it right - if something breaks, you should get a new one - oh and by the way - your warranty will still run out at the end of the original 12 month period.So in response, I won't buy another kindle when this one dies - and given the fact it's refurbished could be anytime soon.I'm going to get an iPad which has a better and bigger screen and my kindle praises will be more muted too.Amazon, you let me down"
1,Very disappointing - in Australia there many titles are unavailable,"I returned my Kindle for a refund. I had been so excited, but when I found how many titles in the self-help, psychology and business genres were unavailable in Australia I was very disappointed. These titles were available on Kindle for US customers.I was advised to read 6 titles for a new job I have started. All were unavailable. So I returned the Kindle and paid for the actual books to be delivered instead. Great books though! Wouldn't waste your time with the Kindle if you are interested in the genres I have mentioned above."
3,Publications not always adequate,"I received my Kindle as a gift and like the device.My first book purchase had poor formatting - spaces in the middle of words and lines endings in the middle of unhyphenated words. It was a small book to try out the Kindle. A quick read so the formatting was just an irritation. My second book, today's 700+ pages, non fiction buy, at $9.95 does not have a table of contents. The kind of book one needs to be able to dip into and skim for items of interest. Is one supposed to print out a hard copy of the TOC to carry around with the Kindle in order to search on the title text? I can't see myself investing any time to plow sequentially through this book. If there is no indication when buying a Kindle publication that it lacks such minimal characteristics of a book as a TOC or normal word formation, how is one to gain confidence in the medium?"
4,Kindle V2,"Very good little device. Newspaper's are too expensive at $22 per month for my taste. Plus no pictures apart from the International Herald Tribune which has one or two. I think it's a good start for an e-reader, and will have a look at the iPad and Microsoft/HP offerings to see if they fare better. Plus marks are it's size and battery life. Negatives are it's lack of free wireless support in Europe, allowing access to only Wikipedia. Otherwise I think it's a great concept. A backlight option would be a useful addition if possible, but suspect e-ink may not be suited"
2,UK Buyers Beware,"The idea behind the Kindle is great, I love the notion I can download books and be reading them in just a minute.However, for the UK Kindle owner this is not the case. Many, and yes I mean many, of the latest books are not available for UK Kindle owners.I wish I could just use a USA address but fear there are other barriers to doing this.Now I know this is most probably due to copyrights and not Amazons fault BUT.It stinks, it really does.Amazon could help by showing when the UK versions will be available."
5,KINDLE 2,i BOUGHT THIS ITEM FOR MY WIFE. SHE IS THRILLED WITH IT. ESPECIALLY THAT YOU CAN ADJUST THE PRINT SIZE. AFTER CHECKING IT OUT I AM AMAZED WITH THE OPERATION AND QUALITY OF THE KINDLE. FOR PROLIFIC READERS THIS IS A MUST HAVE.
5,Best Investment I have made,I love my Kindle2. Best investment I have made in a long time for pleasure.
4,Next best thing since sliced bread,"I was planning on purchasing the Kindle 1 this past Christmas, but my husband informed me of the rumors of the Kindle 2 launch and it was well worth the wait. It shipped super fast and already had the books I purchased on it when it arrived.It is saving me the gas money and time browsing the library and local book stores.I am also broadening my vocabulary with its dictionary look-up tool.No regrets with this purchase ... are there elements to improve upon with the Kindle 3? Sure, but this Kindle is more than I've asked for in a ""book."" ~Meghan Mahaffey"
4,Book Lover Loves Kindle,"I have been collecting and enjoying books since a wonderful 5th-grade teacher infected me with the reading bug. That was over 50 years ago. I thought the Kindle would save me money on book purchases but I didn't realize just how much I would appreciate its speed and ease of downloading books. And the free ones are both classics or some exciting adventure stories. Some lines don't align the way intended and hyphens aren't always where they should be, but it's a small nit in this electronic age ... and the software is currently being updated. Being able to look up words in the OED and to install notes is great, though I'm not sure how to use capital letters or special characters other than the period. If that nit gets picked, my rating will immediately jump from 4 to 5 stars."
4,waited long enough,"I've been waiting for my kindle for a month now, I got it today. I couldn't put it down, it's my first and I love it."
4,Ipod of reading,I received my Kindle a few weeks ago and have finished almost 5 books already !Reading books are effortless and an absolute pleasure..There are some things that could be better but nothing that detracts from the pleasure of using the device.Only thing that Amazon need to look at is pricing of kindle books I have seen books change prices daily and even different prices from different links.... i dont wanna feel like i am being ripped off.but overall well done a brilliant device this will do for reading what Ipod did for music !
4,Unlimited entertainment and enlightenment,"I received my Kindle as a gift. I cannot believe its ease of use. I have newspapers and books on it that, had I had to buy then by conventional means, they would still be at the Amazon warehouse.I do want to confirm what an other reviewer said. The Kindle itself, is awkward to hold. I am always trying to avoid pressing buttons. Perhaps a little pull out handle of one side would be helpful. Another small problem is lighting it. The gray background sometimes makes it hard to read.But these are small matters in relationship to the power one feels being able to read anywhere, anytime from a limitless library.We travel to Mexico just about every year and now I will no longer have to take an extra suitcase for the books I want to read while on the beach.I am so grateful to those who thought I would enjoy this device. I am thrilled to own it. It is a fabulous resource."
3,Check to make sure you have Sprint 3G access at home,"I love my Kindle 1 so much that I paid the price for my Kindle 2. I was one of the first Kindle 1 buyers (and Kindle 2) and have gladly provided exciting reviews to those people who have asked ""What is that?"". But, I am very disappointed that you can ONLY download using Sprint's 3G network. Unfortunately, I do not live in a Sprint 3G network so I CANNOT download anything to my Kindle at home except through my computer. This was not the case with the Kindle 1 as I could download easily at home.This is very disappointing and had I known, I would not have purchased this. Amazon needs to be very upfront about this. While I'm sure I could have found this out before I purchased it, I had no idea to even look for it.All in all, I do love the Kindle but I really should have returned the Kindle 2 for this reason."
3,not all that one may hope for,"yes, it is the power of a pile of books in a hand. Cool... Now - PDF, DOC and others are NOT directly readable - must E-mail to conversion service. After conversion files are not always up to par. the most important problem - some of my DOCs and PDFs are not entirely in English - I have lots of foreign texts. All of them are read just fine by MS Word and Acrobat but after conversion all it shows are Question Marks and black squares. Do not be fooled - consider it if and only if English is your only language of interest. Question to developers - was it so had to install other fonts? If you just can't, why not convert my files into a Black and White GIF or whatever they store pictures in? Bigger, yes, but READABLE!!! If anyone over there is working on a BIOS update - do this! BTW after paying all these money for that device I would consider even some extra fee to be able to read my files. Say $15 per foreign font pack?[...]"
5,Best invention after the book itself,"excellent invention after the book, roku media player and Apple 3G.There're shortcoming though :-difficulty to read PDF directly without converting-sometimes the copy-to-notes button doesn't work when the note is large enough.-no book categorization.-we should have similar like ""page"" rather than ""location"""
3,Still too expensive 4 me,"I do not own a Kindle as of yet. I am an avid reader and love the idea of the Kindle. However, I think it is too expensive and the price of the books are a bit high. I can go buy my books at Costco and or Sam's Club for under [...] or for new, hardback releases around [...] I can also share my books with my friends and visa versa. At the price of [...] or more, and the fact that I cannot share my books, I will hold off on buying the Kindle. I also read A LOT at night in bed and would love to see the Kindle with a backlight like a phone so that I can read without keeping my husband awake. I don't like the idea of a clip on light. I have tried several for reading books in print and the do not work well and the batteries run out too quickly. If they can put a backlight on the Kindle that would greatly increase my desire to purchase one. I will continue to wait on the sidelines until the price comes down and they work on some of the other options I have discussed."
1,BAD PRACTICE,I will never buy a Kindle as long as Amazon has the capability of deleting a book from it. This is absolutely unacceptable. Shame on you Amazon.
5,Love it!,"Best birthday present that I have ever received. Thanks, Mom!I have been using it for a year and have only bought 2 hard copy books since receiving it. This is contrast to reading 60 books on the Kindle."
2,poor quality on ac adaptor,"I am updating my review on this product with a warning about the ac adaptor also thinking of contacting consumers report, call amazon got me a ten dollar certificate but wouldnt replace the ac adaptor, I am trying how to post a pic of the adaptor. the whole wire of the adaptor has disenergrated and only the silver wiring is exposed through out. this wire has never let my nightstand since i have owned this product. never had a wire do this, if anyone knows how i can post a pic on here please let me know"
5,EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS,"My Wife is an avid reader to the point that the Den is almost exploding with books she's read. She hinted that she would love a Kindle 2 for her birthday. Well, I got her one and she couldn't wait to use it. Excellent purchase, and she loves using it. Funny thing is that, we live in a 55+ community in Florida. Well, when she goes to the pool to sit and read her Kingle Books, there is hardly a time when someone doesn't come up to her and ask what that thing is. She explains what it is, and all they can say is ""WOW""!! Most never heard of a Kindle. High ""Cool"" factor in our community.The Kindle is easy to use, handy, convenient, just a fabulous devise. I love it too. Easy to read even on a sunny Florida day. Hopefully, my Den will stop receiving bulky books that we need to find a place to stash.I also got her the leather cover for Kindle. a good idea since it protects it from getting dirty, and I would think pads it in case of a drop incident. God Forbid!!"
5,Kindle by Helen,We have been using the Sony Readers since they come into Canada and have enjoyed them no end but always had to get to the computer to buy another book....with the Kindle it is so easy being able to download directly....the display is excellent and it is very easy to turn to the next page. I have not used any other features so will write another review when I do......
4,Kindle enjoyment,"Whilst it has always been nice to hold a real book in ones hands the kindle certainly does not disapoint. The kindle is a welcome addition tothe reading experience and although I have only been using it for a very short time I have the feeling that I am really going to like using it. The easy and immediate access to new reading material is a real advantage. the Australian kindle needs a power plug and should be fully enabled. The ability to share or even give away books bought is needed. The ability to transfer the kindle library to another reader in the future is also a necessity. My CD collection is currently on an Ipod but because I also have the physical CDs I can change to any brandof MP3 player at any time without loosing access to any of my material, what happens if I no longer want to remain with a kindle reader, do I loose my library of purchased material?"
3,No Buyer's Remorse At All,"I love gadgets so it stands to reason that I would love the Kindle. I am impressed by the amount of books and publications available. I like how it feels in my hands and I like the fact that it fits easily into my purse so that I can pull it out when I find I have an unexpected ""wait"" somewhere.I still like the feel of a real book, though. I like seeing how far I have read and how many pages until the end. I also wish Kindle had a backlight and the ability to change background and font colors.All that being said, I definately have no ""buyer's remorse."""
2,Kindle,The product is an absolutely wonderful and amazing device. I think I would like it better if I did not have to down load my books from the computer although it is not hard to do. I love it as I carry it at all time like my wallet . I can pick it up and read while at a Dr's office on a plane or just parked . I am an avid reader with many friends who never saw the kindle. All that have seen it now own them.
3,"Kindle device OK, but better to use software on iPod iTouch","In our home we have both a Kindle 2 and an iPod Touch with Amazon's free Kindle application on iPod. Quite frankly, the iTouch's smaller screen is not a problem -- the backlighting more than makes up for it. And, the iTouch fits in my pocket and does so much more."
3,Kindle 2 - Ho-Hum,"Good idea, and I'm still in a re-learning curve with it, but tough to find my last read page when turning it back on. Customer support has given me a round-about way to get it back, but it should be automatic. I'll use it because I bought it, but don't see a great advantage over good old books!Sharon"
3,Switch on/off problems,"Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)This is my third Kindle and I love the product and concept.I live outside US most of the time(Italy), so was thrilled by the new Global Wireless model. However, since receiving it, I am having difficulty to get it to switch on/off. The responses are quite sluggish even when switched on. I have tried all the suggested ways of overcoming this problem but as yet, have been singularly unsuccessful in doing so.I had no difficulty with the other two kindles that I purchased, so perhaps it is just a quirk of the particular device I now own, but it is teh reality I have encountered in my ""Global Wireless"" Kindle.J. A. McDaid"
4,My new Amazon Kindle,"I have now read one book on my new Kindle. It works quite all right. The download went without any kind of problems. I look very much forward to continue reading books on this device, which, in my opinion, is not just a gadget, but a really useful device for reading. At least for me, who don't read any book more than once and is not particularly happy to store too much in shelves:)I bought the 6 "" (smallest) version, not the 9,7 "". I was a bit anxious that the display would be too small, but this is not the case. The font size can be adjusted in 6 different fonts, so it's ""customizable"" for most readers' needs. Furthermore, turning pages is very easy, easier than with an ordinary book."
5,Love My Kindle,"I read ALOT and I didn't even know such an item existed. I got the Kindle for Christmas. I love being able to take it anywhere with me and it fits right in my purse (I also bought a case for it). I read alot of books that are in a series. When I am done with one book, I go to the kindle store on my Kindle and download the next book in seconds and continue reading. The prices are wonderful too. Newer releases (hardcover)can be expensive but I purchased one for my Kindle and it was only $9.99. I have a closet full of books and I like the idea of keeping them in the Kindle. I wish I would have had one years aago."
3,lots of positives,"There are some super great things about this kindle. The screen is just as easy on the eyes as paper and nice and sharp. Some times I honestly reach up and try to flip a page before I remember. I also really like the dictionary function where you can scroll down to a word an instantly get a definition (it's great for class assigned readings!). A few things I didn't like however were that some of my books came out in crazy formats that made them a little difficult to follow, and some books I can't find at all in this format. Also just as a warning if you live outside America there may be extra charges for any books you buy or data you want to convert,in Canada I think its something like a $2 charge extra on each book which took me off guard. Other then those things though I like the product over all."
1,Techno-centric,Are we really that eccentric a culture that we need 1500 books at the touch of our fingers?! Why don't we just pick up a book we want to read and bring it with us? Stop being so lazy and lame America.
1,if you buy one of these,you're a complete tool. you should just use your money to hire somebody to feed you
5,Kindle,Couldn't live without it. Saving money and the environment one book at a time. At the airport or the BIG bookstores I look to see what's new and their best sellers and then head back to the gate to download.
3,Kindle's Barrier to Being an Academic Resource,"I love my Kindle. It is great for reading books and I love that I can search across my entire library. However Amazon has been so delighted with the ability to change font size on the fly, that they have not provided any work around for Kindle users who need to have page numbers for academic citations. I have written multiple messages to customer support about this issue and have even talked with a support staff person. Currently I have a Kindle 1 and am considering upgrading. Since I am an academic and need page numbers for citations, I will likely be considering a competitor's product."
4,Great product!,I bought the kindle as a gift for my mother. She absolutely loves it and uses it multiple hours each day. The only problem she has is that we live in an area where there is no AT&T service so a computer is needed to download ebooks. Great visibility in the sun. I recommend this as a gift for anyone or to enjoy yourself.
1,Qualms of a scholar,How do other scholars deal with the lack of page numbers? I would this an insuperable obstacle for citations.
1,iPad is Better,"I just bought my iPad, and my friend has both a Kindle, and a Kindle DX. And in my opinion, when you buy a product as heavy in price in this, why would you spend $300-$500 for JUST BOOKS? Why not spend $500 on something that allows you to do music, applications, internet access, notes, computer document processing, and even let's you watch Television via ABC Application? iPad is more practical, Sorry Amazon, but unless you drop your prices to like $80-$200 Your device just isn't worth it. Once again, Apple Has Created the ""Perfect,"" some might claim ""Godlike"" device, because one thing is for sure, it's made for the gods."
2,Absolutely BS Product !,"The Kindle Is a waist of Hard earned $.Wish I could leave feedback to Amazon Service, wonder why its impossible ?Only to other seller you can, Right !Anyways, very dissapointed with Amazon Service and product, would highly recommend EBAY !!!At least you can leave feedback to anyone !All I have to say is Absolute MONOPOLY !Happy Holidays !"
1,Sucks that they dropped the price. Many of us paid much more!!!!,"I've enjoyed my Kindle. Had I known that Amazon would chase a bookseller for best price against an 'Ereader' I would have waited. It is terrible that those of us being early adopters paid so much more. I can understand a gradual price drop over time. I can't understand a price drop like just happened unless Amazon is really NERVOUS! With that being the case, wait. Heck! Maybe it will be free next month! Bad Vibe!"
4,Enjoy the Kindle!,"We bought the Kindle for our 12 year old daughter for Christmas this year. She has always loved to read, but now we can't keep up. She is going through books like crazy! She had no problem figuring out how to use the Kindle. Purchasing books can be done in a snap. One feature that she loves is the ease in which she can get definitions for words. Before, she would carry a pocket dictionary around with her, now there is no need. The only thing that is missing is a built in light. It would be more convenient for night reading. The other feature that we would appreciate is the ability to trade books with friends and family members. She and her friends frequently share their novels. With the Kindle, each person has to purchase the same book. It would also be nice if you could pre-buy the ebooks and have them just download when they are released. All in all, it is an incredible product."
2,Kindle not ready for our family!,"After anxiously awaiting, the Kindle arrived. I read all the reviews. I was starry eyed in anticipation of the newest addition to our family. I downloaded 100 free ebooks...only to find out there is no way to sort or file all my books...the Kindle directory was a mess. Pages and pages of book titles...yikes! I confirmed with Kindle support that no filing system existed and this made my decision easy...the Kindle was returned the next day.Why have 1500 titles on your Kindle if you can't somehow file them?Kindle..is a great little device...but it is not ready for use by my family.The reason Amazon will forever have my business...is that I returned the Kindle with little hassle or aggravation. Amazon is a pleasure..and Kindle gets two stars just because Amazon stands behind their products!"
3,Display not as clear as Kindle 1,"I've had the Kindle 2 for almost three weeks. Having been an avid fan of Kindle 1, I expected an even better user experience. when I received my Kindle 2 I was very impressed with the design, especially the improved button design.The one serious disappointment has been the display. I noticed this almost immediately but thought it was due to my poor eyesight. Eventually I realized ( and read alot of blogs about the problem) it was not my eysight.The Kindle is an amazing overall product. But I'm reverting to Kindle 1 until amazon can fix the display on Kindle 2."
2,A devoted Kindle 1 user is disappointed with Kindle 2,"I absolutely loved my Kindle 1 and couldn't wait for K2, thinking it would solve the awkward key design of K1. K2 does do that but unfortunately has a significant defect that the Kindle forums are raging about. The text clarity and screen sharpness of K2 is severely disappointing and produces eye fatigue. Unless Amazon provides a software patch to fix the problem, I'll be returning my K2. Unfortunately, I've already sold my K1! I would suggest all K1 devices owners to wait until this problem is solved."
5,I cannot imagine life without my Kindle,I LOVE my Kindle!!!! I am a person who reads several books at a time. This has been an amazing product to use...all of my books with me in one little device. I can switch between books without hauling around a huge bag anymore!
5,Kindle satisfaction,"I was really hesitant to use a Kindle because I really liked the idea of holding a book and turning pages. When I finally decided to order a Kindle, I ordered the leather case with it so that it would feel more like a book, and it does. I find I can read much faster because the print size is adjustable and very clear unlike a printed book where you get variances in type clearity. Also, being able to download a sample of the book (without cost) so that you can read the first chapter or two, is great. I am sorry I waited so long to buy one. I love it!!!!"
4,I really like my kindle,I debated a long time about purchasing a Kindle. Then I had a little extra money and decided to do it. It took me a little while to get used to reading from it but I do love it. Sometimes it is a little harder than a book to see in low light but it more than makes up for that with its lack of glare and ease of reading in bright sunlight. I do wish there were more books for it that were a little cheaper.
4,Great but needs work,I have both the kindle 2 and the iPhone kindle. Both of them are great products. The only down sides I can find are with the kindle 2. The first would be with it not having a back light. I'm the kind of person that likes to read before I go to bed and it's just a hassle to have to turn on the light in order to read. Your already paying over 300 dollars for the product and I don't like the fact that you have to pay even more money to get the light attachment.The second downside is the voice reading feature. It sounds very robotic and monotone. It doesn't pick up on punctuation well and in my opinon is the worst feature for the kindle.Besides that I really would reccomend the product to anyone. The upsides and convince of the kindle far out weigh any of the things that still need work.
4,"Kindle2 the ""Tipping Point"" for reading is here","The Kindle2 takes 30 minutes of reading a great book to get used to. After that, reading habits are changed forever. The Kindle disappears and it is just you, the author and the story.If you love books but also love the environment, it does not take very long with a Kindle before cutting down trees to make books and burning oil to distribute them starts making a big fat book look a lot like a Hummer.I am not yet comfortable with newspapers and magazines on Kindle but I am trying because I really prefer to read on the Kindle. But, when the navigation is non-linear as opposed to a book, and you are trying to pick just the articles that are right for you, the Kindle navigation is not yet as intuitive for me as the old paper versions. I'll get there but this is a slightly more challenging adjustment."
4,"Excellent product, but still room for small improvements",Length:: 2:35 MinsA quick 2 minute review of the ups and downs of the Kindle 2
5,I'm worth it.,"I thought I was being frivolous in upgrading from Kindle1, but quickly decided that I'm worth it. Some of the improvements are small, but made a good product awesome. I really prefer new joystick over old roller selector. Much easier to find or go to pages, words, bookmarks, definitions, etc. No more accidental page turns. Love speech to text feature, though I hear this is threatened! Don't use it often, but when I do it's great for a book you can't keep reading but just can't put down. I appreciate all the free books, though you do have to sift through them."
4,good even better when you add deKindle,"One of the reasons I like Kindle so much is the ability to get my own documents, publications, reference and the stuff I need to my Kindle. To get the most out of your Kindle use deKindle (free tool). Download Link: http://www.ekwintools.com/kndl.exe (Web Site: http://www.ekwintools.com)deKindle was designed to create publications for Amazon's Kindle devices page by page from scratch or to import your publications from another source and to convert it to Kindle in a matter of minutes. If you create a publication with images, deKindle will package all your images for you. Another benefit is that all publications you create with deKindle can be posted on the web and viewed with any web browser.deKindle also comes with Built-in 256-bit Blowfish encryption, compression and e-mail.Create your own digital library with your own content."
4,Limited books avaiable on Kindle,Let me make this clear - I LOVE my kindle. I have recommended the Kindle to many people who have since purchased one. I can no longer recommend it because there are so many books I want to download which are not available.
4,Great Device,"Overall I am very happy with the Kindle. I love it! Sounds minor but easier to read than a book since you don't have to work about folding it or messing with a hardback if you want to lie down reading etc, makes for a much more pleasant reading experience.Also - I have been reading quicker and going through books like crazy!Well worth the money and you do save in the long run by the discounted price from the books! Highly recommend."
1,Amazon has deleted digital books from customers' Kindles after they've already bought them.,How's this for irony:Amazon has deleted digital books from customers' Kindles after they've already bought them. The kicker? The books were Orwell's 1984 and Animal Farm. - Seattlest 7/17/09
4,"Great for kids, too!","I ordered a kindle for my husband's Christmas present, but then I realized I'd ordered 2 by mistake. I didn't know what to give to my 12 year old daughter yet, so I gave her the kindle. And she LOVES it. She's had it for about 2 months now, and she's read 18 books. It's also great because she can get any book she'd like to read, and it's really broadened her reading area. The only problem is that some of the authors haven't published their book to kindle yet, but it's still a great device."
5,Fantastic little device,"I bought this as a gift for my husband and he really loves it. It's so light, easy to read, and handy to just simply buy a book and there it is ready for you to read. The audio for the books is great too. I find myself wanting to sneak it away from him as much as possible."
3,Proof Read Books Converted from Text to Kindle!!!!!,"Amazon needs to edit books formatted to/into kindle from paperback. Grammatical errors abound! Misspelling, syntax and missing punctuation. After attempting to read ""Sea of Thunder"" [...] I was so frustrated that I asked for and received a refund. Might be something to do with the way the books are scanned, or just the College intern doing the scanning. Someone needs to proofread converted books. How often over the years have you encountered a problem with print? Really, completely unacceptable."
2,Mine broke in a week!,I put the kindle down on my coffee table when my 11 year old touches the screen thinking it was touchscreen. The screen caved in with ease and now im out 369$
1,"On my third kindle, still doesn't work","I was so excited to finally get the kindle Christmas of 2009 after hearing all about it. I love to read, and dug the fact I could quickly download books. Plus, the ability to only take a small device on trips that was able to provide many books for entertainment.CAN YOU SAY DISAPPOINTED?????While the device functions well, except for newspaper downloads, which were too much of a pain to read, I am unable to recharge the dang thing using an a/c outlet. I'm currently on my THIRD kindle (in 6 months) and guess what, it doesn't recharge either, only via the USB computer connection.I am getting ready to call, yet again, and see what happens.I will say, customer service is great, as I had a replacement fedexed by the next day (twice so far). Over the phone support has been concientious and helpful, BUT.....The IPAD is looking better and better.I am infuriated that I may now be on my FOURTH kindle in 6 months!"
3,"Kindle is just ""OK""","My husband gave me a Kindle for Christmas and I immediately fell in love with it at first. Then the magic spell began to wear off:Pros:Portable; Convenient; Relatively long battery life; Can download books for preview prior to purchasing.Cons:(1) No backlight. Can purchase separate light, but that's additional battery expense and something else to carry and keep track of. A backlight would be much more convenient and practical.(2) How about a wriststrap for device? I accidentally dropped mine while I was reading it and now the screen is frozen and I have to send it in for repair. The design makes it very easy to accidentally drop.(3) Device does become completely illegible when used outdoors in sunlight, thereby limiting where it can be read. I like to sit out on my patio and read but it's pretty hard to do when display fades."
4,DON'T PANIC,"I feel like maybe the only thing it's missing is a cover that says ""DON'T PANIC"" in big, friendly letters."
2,Disappointed,"While I just received my $259.00 Kindle which I really enjoy, it would have been much more enjoyable if I had bought from Amazon at the new price of $189.00. Not even two weeks old the company drops the price $70.00 and offers me nothing in return. They have a monoply on the book prices as you can not purchase them anywhere else but Amazon then they stick it to you with a price reduction right after you buy the unit from them. Thanks Amazon I will be very particular on what I purchase from you if anything.Very, Very disappointed in Amazon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Please do not buy,"Technical and book appreciation issues aside, the Kindle is a device designed to help Amazon.com and not to help you read books. Please do not buy one until Amazon corrects its behavior. Speak with your wallet."
1,Too pricey,"A friend of mine bought the Kindle and I was intrigued by the idea of having such portability without the bulk. I'm one of those people that can't travel anywhere without a bunch of books. But when I heard the price...forget about it. I'll consider it when there's more competition that forces Amazon to reduce its price. There's sure to be evolution in the technology and at $359, that's a bit too expensive to have to replace in a year."
3,Interesting Tool,"I'm a wealthy man fortunately, and I found the Kindle DX to be an interesting tool to purchase. I have one in my Jaguar, one right next to my sterling silver lavatory, and another on the bedstand next to my $30,000 california king. I don't know how I ever lived without them. I encourage anyone of means to invest in one. For everyone else, you really should consider foregoing food, gasoline, and clothing for several months so you can get your hands on one, or you could consider financing....it's worth the sacrifice!!! If you're an avid reader, the Kindle will pay for itself in less than a decade!"
1,Buy an Ipad...soooooo much better in every way,"Why would someone buy a device that has only one function when they can get the whole package with an iPad????? even though people might argue that the kindle is ""cheaper"" (although they are right, t is a cheap product in comparison to an iPad!!!!!....it eaven looks cheap!), the iPad offers almost an infinite number of possibilities. It's like comparing a typewriter (Kindle) Vs. a modern computer (iPad) it's not a smart buy!"
5,Love It,"I love my Kindle! I have six bookcases full of books in my home! I love to read and to share my books with others, however, I was running out of space to store more. So I decided to try a Kindle. It is wonderful! The downloads are easy and quick. I can change the font size with the touch of a button, so as I get older, my Kindle print can change with my eyesight. Also, I really like having the dictionary included in the Kindle. Too often I have read a word of which I was not sure of the definition. It is so easy to move the cursor to the word and have the definition immediately! I even like the word to text for when I have to stop reading to fix dinner - I can keep reading! I have told many friends and complete strangers I have seen in restaurants and Starbucks about the Kindle. I know I have at least three friends who have purchased the Kindle following my demo. They all love it!"
4,Kindle,"Love the product, but after using approximately 3 times, the screen malfunctioned. Only lines showed up, I have returned the Kindle and have not received a replacement yet, hope to use this for a long time. Really enjoyed the size and how easy it was to read. I was a skeptic."
4,Page Turn Placement - How do YOU hold the Kindle 2?,I love my Kindle 2. The only thing I would improve is the page turn button placement. I haven't figured out how to hold the reader comfortably while having my thumb on the page turn. How do you hold your Kindle 2 while reading?
4,Raymac Kindle Review,"Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)This is a fantastic concept. I love the simplicity and speed of the onc click download of books.My only rservation is that the Australian version does not have electric power recharge."
5,Best Reading Device Ever,"When I saw that Kindle 2 would read to me, I ordered it right then. I have been visually impaired for many years, used a lot of different means of reading, but Kindle 2 takes the prize and the wireless capability, the prices at the Kindle store and much more makes this a great product. I do wish the letters/numbers on the keyboard were black or at least have better contrast with the key itself. I need, too, a magnifier that would just fit over the text screen so I could better read the little I need to read before starting Text to Speech. I use a hand magnifier now,but need both hands free."
4,This is a refurbished 2nd Generation Kindle,"The ad for this Kindle is not very clear, so I thought I'd try to provide some clarification. The CS people at Amazon informed me this ad is for the KINDLE SECOND GENERATION, not the first generation.This seems to be a good deal, and a cheaper alternative to the 3rd Generation, 3G+Wifi. I also wanted to clarify that the 2nd Generation does NOT have Wifi, it connects over 3G only. That may be common knowledge, but I thought I'd add it in there."
3,1st generation refurb,Be aware! After speaking with Amazon cs I found out the refurb Kindle is Version 1-Not such a great deal when you can get a brand new Version 2 for $30 more.
2,If the screen worked it would be a good reader,This is the second time I have had to replace this reader. It would be a nice product if (big IF) the screen didn't fail so often. The first on went blank and the second one has horizontal and vertical lines making it impossible to read... The product has a lot going for it... when it works.
5,*GOT BOOKS?*,"*GOT BOOKS?*Hi Everyone! I'm not an electronic book owner, but I am asking you, those of you who do use it, to help me collect old books that can be reused and distributed among depleted libraries across the nation. Do you have old books you could share? Something you haven't read in a while? Even one book would mean a lot. Something old for you can be new for someone else!If you've an old books sitting on your shelves, not being used, please share the knowledge!Thank you.passingtheknowledge@yahoo.com420 McKinley Street, Suite 111-367, Corona, CA 92879"
3,Kindle use in the UK,The Kindle is an excellant item for carrying around Europe. The weight being the main factor for me.The downside to this is that you cannot use Amazon.co.uk to purchase books.This increases the price of the books by adding currency exchange commission on purchases.We also lose out by not being able to collect Nectar points as Amazon.com is a seperate company to Amazon.co.uk.
4,Simply Superb!,"Being very brief, here are is a testimony to the highlights of the Kindle -Pros -a) Eye strain is actually ZERO. I have read a book for 12 hours straight on an international flight, and felt no strain on my eyes. Reading off the iphone / laptop would have reduced my vision a couple of points!b) Works beautifully internationally - tried it in India and Kuwait... worked well, downloaded fairly fast.c) Intuitive controls, excellent keypad.d) Great battery life.e) Beautiful aesthetics.Cons -a) There is a delivery charge for 2 bucks per book, and 5 bucks per week for periodicals if delivered internationally.b) You cannot easily see it before buying. There is the kindle owners society or whatever where owners can show you their device, but it is not easy. You can see the Sony reader / Barnes $ Noble Nook everywhere. They need to fix this - and show off the fact that the Kindle is better than the other two by far."
1,Can I highlight an area?,"a)When I read technical books, I first read them, pick all the important sections, highlight them with different colors (rank of importance) and then I go back and read the highlighted sections. Can this be done with device?b) Let's say you have bought several hundred dollars of kindle format books and one day, you drop it or somehow gets smashed in a trip or falls in the water. What's going to happen to all the books on the device?c) Amazon needs to either give this device away for selling more books, or cut the price of the Kndle books in half."
1,Hosed,"BE VERY CAREFUL. Just bought this as a birthday gift for a friend about two weeks ago, now Amazon drops the price by about $70 with no recourse other than return and reorder (not feasible since it was given as a gift).I've been using Amazon as my 'go to place' for almost any shopping for years and loved the Prime service, but that just came to a halt. I'll probably still use Amazon for small purchases but nothing of any significant cost in the future."
1,Get an Ipad dummie!,The Ipad will make this obsolete. Don't waste your money. Buy an Ipad. The backlight is better on the Ipad and a ton of other features are better. Check out the specs if u get a chance. Two thumbs down for the Kindle.
1,Touch Touch,I will never buy any electronic device any more if it do not have touch option. pushing buttons and using keyboard is in the past now.Please make things easy for us. ADD TOUCH OPTION.....
5,Love It,"This is a 2nd Kindle. I raved so much about the Kindle I received forChristmas my brother in law asked me to get his wife one for her birthday (for him). I absolutely love my Kindle. Just returned from a vacation in Jamaica took my kindle, so simple to pack, battery lasts two weeks or so. So easy to take to the beach or pool, I can't say enough nice things about it. Many people have asked about what I was doing and I am happy to show them. I was surprised that I could get on line in Jamaica and it wasn't a problem. I had loaded it with a few books thinking I would not be able to get more...but I could.I just love this....Sandy"
4,New Kindle,"I travel to Europe several times a year and as an avid reader I am always lugging around books as once you get away from the airports there are very few english books. With the kindle I can download a new book almost anywhere I want. Even in the middle of the night when I can't sleep.They are not kidding. 60 sec to download. Great for airplanes except you have nowhere to stuff your ticket when you get up to deplane.The Cons: It would be nice if it had in a small light for reading after dark and a strap on the back you could slip you hand in to keep it from sliding off.It will never replace cuddling up with a good book on a cold afternoon nor in bed at night, but it is a good product that I will get a lot of use out off.Oh it really cuts down on the need for bookcases."
2,Frozen-can't use,"I was enjoying using the Kindle until......I was in the middle of a move and had ignored the Kindle for a few days. When I went back to it, it was frozen with a picture on the screen-partly obscured. I thought it was because it needed to be recharged. When I finally found the plug (remember I was moving!) and charged it, it still does not work--can't access through any of the buttons, menu, on-off button, toggle button. I have just found a phone number to call Amazon. Hopefully they will make it right."
5,GREAT,Great concept....I live and work in Afghanistan so that means I spend a lot of time in airports and on planes. The use of the Kindle has been a great way to past the time and stay in touch with the rest of the world.
5,Ann's new toy,"Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, U.S. Wireless)What can I say. I did a lot of research on the wireless reading devices and always came back to the Kindle. I saw my first one on the beach in the Bahamas and said I need one of those. I am an avid reader and always carrying lots of books is bothersome. It is easy to operate and you can very easily down load new books from where you are.For the best get Kingle.Ann"
5,time = money,"Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, U.S. Wireless)Ok, I just have to say I love my kindle! It reads to me on the metro (I use head phones), books cost me a lot less and are delivered in less than a minute, and all kinds of books I am interested in (programming books mostly and classics like Lord of the Rings) are available from a multitude of sources. It's a great tool that will pay for itself in less than a year for me."
5,Essential for Travelers!!,"My husband and I travel frequently and have a boat that we spend much time on and this was one of the best investments I have made in a long time!!! Waiting time in the airport? No problem. Don't have to buy trash mags, just download a book. Better yet, I like to download several samples (free) for my next read. I have found I am reading much more than I have. I can also wake up anywhere and have my home newspaper at the touch of a finger for reading with my coffee. Much easier to run the treadmill without having to hold the page down; both hands are free. One problem is that I have to keep ripping it away from my husband! Get your own!!"
5,Absolutely Amazing!,"I love my Kindle 2. Now, imagine my horror. I had an emergency last night and had to rush my son to the ER. Being completely panicked and out of my mind, I managed to leave my Kindle 2 with the leather Amazon cover on the top of my van. Off I went. I realized my mistake upon reaching the hospital. My son turned out to be just fine after a bit of a scare. Five hours later, I drove home and scanned the streets. Lo and behold, I find the cover butterflyed and face down in the middle of the street about half way to the hospital. The Kindle had popped right out of the cover and landed on the side of the road. After a rough night, I was exhausted and sad to pick up my poor Kindle. Now, imagine my utter shock and surprise! It was in perfect working order."
2,NO POINT TO A KNDLE NOW,"I've owned my kindle for about two years now. I used to love my kindle, instant books at a much cheaper price than getting them at the bookstore. Used it all the time, one book after another. No more. When I bought my (very expensive) kindle, books were 9.99. Kindle was big time advertising that new, just released books, would be 9.99. And they were until recently. The last book I purchased, just a few weeks ago, was only 1.50 less than it would have been at the bookstore. New releases are no longer 9.99, they are barely better than going to the bookstore. So why bother. Kindle says its out of their hands, its the publishers. But it was kindle who advertised ""new releases for 9.99"" when I purchased mine. Since the publishers don't have to print, store, ship, etc etc,....why should their books cost so much now on the kindle. I feel a bit ripped off."
1,Kindle 2 and PDF,I was given the Kindle 2 as a Birthday present. I did want it to read books and PDF technical manuals. The Amazon web site says it will read a PDF.After I received the Kindle2 I loaded a PDF but could not read it. After spending an hour on the Amazon site to find out why I could not read a PDF I had to do a Google search. I did find that you have to E-mail the PDF to Amazon and they cover it for the Kindle2.No place in the Kindle2 sale literature does it say that PDF have to be sent for converting. I feel Amazon drop the ball on this and should have stated that the Kindle2 CAN'T read a PDF directly.Robert
3,Still needs some refinements,"Yup, it's thin. Yup, you can download books fast. It's definitely cool But these are the things I'd work on:1. There's no good way to hold it. Some shallow indentations in the front bottom corners for your thumbs would help.2. The page turning buttons are awkwardly placed. I'd put them lower, where your thumb most logically sits.3. The page turning buttons click. I don't think we need the noise.4. There's no option to backlight the screen. So, you almost have to buy a clip-on light/cover.5. I wish there were more travel guides available. What better use for the Kindle?I find myself preferring my iPhone app, which is easy to hold, backlit, and allows you to swish the screen to the next page silently.Still, it's a pretty incredible machine overall."
5,"Truly wonderful,","My Kindle was delivered on time and in top notch condition. Firstly the packing was really wonderful. As I buy a lot of Apple products it is always a good experience to open the box, and you have that spot on, the whole family gathered around to view the proceedings :) It worked seamlessly form the moment I started to use it, really impressed with the speed of whispernet and the choice of books. It will never stop me adding to my large library but it works so well for travel. On a fun note, I dropped it on my head when I fell asleep in bed and it did hurt! I wonder if it had a back light, to turn on and off,would it drain the battery too much? Would it be possible to have folders on the home page to drag and drop? I would recommend Kindle to every one, good experience and it works with my mac:D"
4,Take it with you,"I recently purchased the 6"" Kindle wireless reading device. I chose the size for its weight and comfort. I wanted something I could take along with me, and felt the 10"" Kindle would be too unwieldy. The display is quite readable. As claimed, the charge lasts a long time with the wireless feature turned off. I subscribed to a newspaper and was able to get ""delivery"" while on vacation. I found this to ba a wonderful feature. Reading a book would be a similar experience on a Kindle as on paper. I find, however, that reading a newspaper does not have the same feel. Although one can see a menu of articles in each section, navigating from the section list to the article list to the article, itself, and back again becomes tedious. In a traditional newspaper, one can easily skim the headlines and turn the pages. The rest of the Kindle navigating features are pretty intuitive and simple to learn.Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)"
5,kindle is awsome,I have trouble with holding large hard bound books or big soft cover books.now its all the same. and i like the idea of any types of books.. and that you can even get books for 99 cents. i can take it in the car too. with the attachment to charge it
5,"Fantastic, just love it , after only 3 days","Having finally waited until an international version was available I am truly amazed with its capabilities, ease of reading , speed of download , even to australia.My wife who is really is a luddite with technology even found reading a book on it very easy and captivating.I love all the features."
4,Kindle 2 Review,I like the Kindle 2. I have a few things that I would change but for the most part its a very good product and I'm happy I purchased it. I wrote a blog at http://davidkbarker.wordpress.com/ if you want a deeper review.
3,Disappointed Canadian Kindle owner,I purchased my Kindle the moment it became available in Canada. Much to my disappointment many of the books that interest me are not available to Canadians. i am purchasing books I would never consider reading. I am hoping the Canadian market will catch up to the American market quickly so I can enjoy this wonderful product.
4,I expected more,"Pros. Easy to read under any light. Quick access to a lot of fiction and nonfiction books. Comfortable to handle.Cons. Despite what is written in the user guide, you have to charge it every week, even when you don't use it. Small print passages are difficult to read. Lots of interesting books are not available."
4,Canadians Beware,I love my kindle. But I am so disappointed that after waiting so long for it to come to Canada that I can't get all the titles. I wanted to download one of Alice Munro's books and it is not available for kindle accounts originating in Canada. This is totally bizarre considering that the author is Canadian!
4,kindle,I am very pleased with my new Kindle. I am still learning how to use it as with all new products.
4,"Good, but there is area for improvement","This device is great for reading, but it should support native PDFs and other formats directly.The catalgo should also include more medical books and foreign language (spanish books). Nevertheless I think it is great not to be carrying 2-4 kg of books from here to there, but just carrying this nice item."
4,Can't put it down,"I've had the kindle 2 for a few weeks now and I can't put it down. I have read several books and my daily paper on it. The wireless delivery of the paper every morning is great and much more reliable than the local delivery, particularly when I'm catching the early train.I find, particularly when reading a book, that the device disapears and you foget about it, just like you forget about the paper pages in a book. The next page and back page are easy to press but not so easy I accidentally press them.The only reasons I'm not giving 5 stars is it's a bit pricey and while there are plenty of kindle versions of books I wish there were a few more magazines available. I also wish the device could read .pdf files without having to go through a conversion process that doesn't work all that well.Overall I definitely recommend this device for anyone who loves to read and commuters looking to read the paper without getting their hands covered in newsprint."
5,Best choice of the Ebooks on the market,"This is an additional Kindle for my wife and I. We had the DX for about 5 months and have added this so we can both read and share. Best purchases we have made this year. I enjoy the larger DX and my wife loves the smaller 6"" display. The only thing we can't seem to figure out is if we can share our mag and newspapers between our two Kindles. If you love reading and you want to take many options with you this is the way to go. We both have the M Edge lights which solved any lack of light problems we experienced. Actually purchased this second Kindle after researching the new Barns and Noble reader. We are convinced the Kindle is the better choice."
3,"Great, but lacks privacy of content","Okay, let me start by saying I love my Kindle. However what irks me A LOT is that there is no way to permanently remove content once purchased, either on the device or on the computer. Kindle is unlike a regular book that once you've purchased, read and decided it's not something you want to keep, you can get rid of it. Sure, you can ""archive"" items so they're no longer on the home page, but all you have to do is click on the Archive section of the Menu and all the ""removed"" items are clearly listed and can be recalled with one touch of the button. So if you want to lend it to someone else, they have access to ALL of your content, which you may or may not want them to have. If Amazon had only forseen this ONE thing, which is a basic privacy issue - and really, just how hard would that have been? - I'd be singing out on rooftops about this thing rating it 5+++++ stars. Amazon, please fix this!"
5,Ending,"It is an easy and interesting way to read. Although you can go to the last page read, there is no way to go to the end of the book. The last page of the book I read said that it was 99% completed. Being unable to check whether I was at the actual end of the book, and it being a Tom Wolfe book - I was not sure.It also is a little disappointing that the dedication pages are not included, they often provide and interesting insight."
4,Almost there,"I own the original kindle and I love it. I have one complaint only: the font. Would it be possible to have a sans serif font choice? When you make this change, I will buy a new one."
4,"great device, should have waited.","great device, but when i tried to order the new lighted cover - hey! it won't fit. sent it back, waiting on the ""latest generation""."
3,"Kindle 3G, 6"" 2nd Generation","Reading a novel by using the Kindle is easy and clean. However, holding the Kindle comfortably is less easy. The design isn't exactly ergonomically correct - due to the placement of the buttons. It's a good thing it's so lightweight. The fact that while on a trip you don't have to bring reading materials with you is convenient. There is library of over 600,000 titles to choose from and many are free. All in all if I had to make the purchase again - having experienced it - I probably wouldn't bother."
3,Disappointed,"I received a new generation Kindle as a gift. I've found that contrary to what is advertised the books are much more than the $9+ price. I can wait and buy the books in paperback for much less at Target. Also, many times it takes a long time for a page to connect. I wish I had tried the Nook to compare the two."
2,product returned,"it seemed silly to me to offer the 2nd generation when the 3rd was about to come out with the same price. As soon as I heard about the 3rd, I returned the 2nd generation which I had just that day received, to wait for the 3rd with more features. so the 2nd generation one received was returned unopened. Still waiting for the 3rd generation delivery."
1,Defective,Less then 1 month had to send it back because of lock up issues. Amazon should have held off selling until the newer model was available for the same price
4,Not as impressed now,"I have had my Kindle 2 for a year. I had no problems with it until I left it in screen saver mode for about a month during the Christmas holidays. Now every time I click to awake it, I have this annoying background image like it's burned into my display. It does mostly go away once I open a book, but still.... Amazon says that the Kindle never goes to a blank (white) screen on its own. So, be sure to close yours completely out if you aren't going to be using it for an extended time."
5,awesome Technology,My wife bought me one for Christmas and its amazing. She did her homework on e readers and I believe she chose the best! Easy to use and Amazon has a large selection to make everyone happy!
4,Kindle Travels Well,"I have had many friends tell me about this product, Amazon Kindle, and have to say - they were right. This is really easy to get set up and use. Within minutes of receiving my Kindle - I had our local news already streaming. Next up was my first book. This book was one of my work related books and it was so nice not to have to carry the book around. My Kindle is so much lighter. Less weight within my backpack was awesome.I still like to turn pages from time to time. Traveling - the Kindle has made packing easy and simple. If I forget to get a book - download in minutes. Finish on a plane ride. Download another one - in minutes. Fast, easy and light..."
4,Kindle II Gift Idea,"I really like the Kindle II, I received this as a birthday present. I am an avid book reader. One of my favorite features is being able to look up words as you are reading a book. I also like to be able to down load books on demand. I found that it is easy to read on the paper like screen, this was something I was worried about when I got it. I do wish it had an internal light of some kind, although I bought the mighty bright light accessory and a cover for it, so it feels more like a real book. Also you can have books read to you just like a book on CD with or without speakers. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking to unclutter their space or who has a very small living space. The other nice thing is that you can take an entire library worth of books with you on any trip."
3,Text is not dark enough,"The text comes out gray and there isn't an option to change to bold. It get hard on the eyes after a while. Also folders would an excellent addition (MP3, Books, etc.)"
3,Kindle gets International or not ?!?!,The feeling I get it is stable and solid but not sexy.First impression really good to read on and also it is nice to even read computer books that always are thick as a brick. So it is a big step for mankind BUT .....a) Taking notes in Swedish where are my swedish characters ÄÖäö its like in the 80:ies when we used VT100 or the first PCb) You can download/buy and search in Wiki great but read email etc. then you have to use your Iphone....c) No touchscreen its like before Iphone was released you have to press some buttons you never really understand the function of when you are used just to move on the screend) Home page where you display the first 23 characters of the title and the title is Professional Microsoft S.....give me a break we have a full screen and I should 1500 books on it. And this is the third generation. Hire some people form Apple [...].I like it BUT..ThanksMagnus Sälgö
4,Great device and service for all readers,I've bought Kindle 2 after selling my old Kindle DX which was to big for me. Kindle 2 is the best reading experience I have ever had. Read when and where you want - battery won't drain in less then 2 weeks. Buying books from Amazon is as easy as sending SMS from my mobile. I love it. Occasionally you can access any websites on internet from your book - it's really cool feature.Reading books on Kindle is like reading paperback books. The only difference is the weight - Kindle is very light but not to much so it's almost ideal device.Cons:- poor internet browser (but it's not so important)- clicks when switching page
5,Great screensaver,"The Kindle is everything it claims to be. It's a bit heavier than I imagined, and the refresh rate takes a bit time to used to, but overall it's a great device. Very easy on the eye.The most impressive part for me is the screensavers. Every time the kindle is turned off, it shows a different screensaver. It's usually is either a portrait of a famous author or a classical drawing. They look great on the kindle screen."
4,Love mine but.....limited connection.,I love my kindle but in my area the connection is everything called limited!! I live in an area that has only few cellular services. I knew it might be hard to get kindle connection but never thought I would not be able to connect at all. Well I cannot. Can drive to a little town 20 minutes away and connect perfectly but not at all in my town. I can connect to my computer and download any book I want so it's not a serious problem but the convenience is limited. I was needless to say very dissapointed and went through two kindles to make sure it wasn't a product problem. I still love the ability to read my books like this. It's just not what I expected.
4,My New Kindle,"I love my new Kindle. Took it on a cruise and it was fantastic, especially on the long plane ride to the cruise ship. The only thing that disappointed me was that you can't see it with the lights off, so I can't read in bed. However, a night light should be perfect and I plan to get one. Would highly recommend it to anyone who reads a lot."
4,Love this product!,"I purchased the Kindle 2 about one month ago and I absolutely love it. I have read four books on it already and it is very easy to use. I had a concern about connectivity because I live in an area with a lot of cell phone dead zones, but the wireless works flawlessly - in fact, it takes less time to download a book than it does to download one piece of music on my computer from itunes.My only complaint (minor one) is the price of books. The thought of improving the environment is a positive (not having to get rid of all the paper) but joining a book club with the specials still beats the Amazon price - Jeff, you need to work on this. Maybe with time, this will change. All in all though this is a great concept.."
3,Fun while it lasted....,"I enjoyed it in the brief time it worked. I found that some of the criticisms I've read were unwarranted. Unfortunately, it would not recharge. I had to return it. I'm sure Amazon is going to improve the Kindle. There are other players entering the market and the Kindle is going to have to meet the challenge presented by competitor's offerings. If my experience is at all typical, there are reliablity issues to address. I will consider buying the next version. I don't want to lay out $259.00 only to have the devise fail shortly after the warranty expires."
2,Kindle versus IPAD,"At this early stage, I think I made a serious error in judgment by purchasing the Kindle when i did. I should have waited a few months to compare it to the IPAD before making a decision. I've already investigated selling my Kindle after the IPAD goes on the market. In my early investigation of the IPAD it has many more features which interest me. However, I will continue to use my Kindle for the next few months and then make a decision. I'll keep you posted.Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, U.S. Wireless)"
3,Kindle,"I'm completing the second book I've purchased for my kindle. My wife and I share the Kindle but read different books.Things I like: 1) Great battery life 2) Easy on eyes. Things I don't like: 1) page turn button should be used for both back and forward on both sides. Separate ""page back"" button only on left side results in accidentally paging forward. 2) Difficult to determine size of book because progress is primarily measured in percent of completion. 3) Start-up and close time is too slow. With traditional books I may pick them up to read while my shower water warms, totally unpractical with Kindle. 4) Needs proper internet interface i.e. too many devices, PC, notebook, iphone & kindle...what next 5) Symbols & Pictures don't enlarge even when font is changed, makes some reading more difficult 6) Button organization is not as intuitive as could be"
4,Fantastic,This is fantastic! I love how you can purchase books on amazon and on the kindle. The font looks like real ink and the device has a real air of quality to it. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is that it has frozen on me twice since I got it (3 days ago) and seems to only want to turn off only some of the time after holding the switch for 4 seconds. Otherwise a fantastic piece of kit. Already got tons of compliments on it!
4,"The new ""collection"" function is great!","At first I'd thought this change was cumbersome but having used it for a few days setting up my ""collection"" I find this improvement is very useful because it works like library bookshelves that the user can name her own collection."
5,Kindle,Love my Kindle. In the beginning it was a little hard to get used to since I missed feeling the weight of a book in my hand and turning the pages myself.
4,Kindle 2 review,"The Kindle 2 is a wonderful device but I have a few recommendations to make it better.Learning to use is a bit more involved than I anticipated. I think you should send a printed version of the ""how to use"" when you ship the Kindle instead of asking purchaser to read from kindle or print it out - it is very long.I also think it would be very helpful for owners to know that when Kindle is ""sleeping"" if the wireless is on then the battery is being drained. Mine drained completely and would not recharge.My last recommendation is that if a book has photos then those should be included in the download of the book. I was disappointed that they were not included."
3,Fraidy Scared to buy one,"After going back and forth for weeks about a purchase of this item, I decided on the SONY PRS-505. The books on the Sony website are $11.99. The reader was $258.88 @ VANNS with no tax and free shipping. The SONY comes with a leather case. This is the justification: I will still read paper because I have many many stacks of books at home which I have not yet read (probably one year's worth). I do not read pop fiction (James Patterson, Dean Koontz, etal.)so the Sony library is just fine. The pdf file reader is appealing as is the card slot (up to another 2 gig) so it seems like a nice package. The removal of books from the Kindle made me queasy but that was not the reason for my ultimate decision. I hope you find this helpful."
1,What you buy is not your own,"The recent deletion of PURCHASED items, as I'm sure many others here have stated, shows just how flawed this device and the model surrounding it is.Until this device is released as a Free Software device, free from control and restrictions of a manipulating corporation that maintains power over the literary works held therin, this is a flawed technology."
1,Deleting books is not nice,"I saw it at a friend, I liked it for a while and I even wanted to buy one, but in the end I didn't like that Amazon decided to delete some books..."
2,Big Brother?,As long as Amazon has the power to reach into my private property and delete what they wish (or what the government may order them to) I will postpone buying a Kindle.
1,Defective by design,"It's unacceptable that Amazon can delete books from your Kindle any time they like, and even cripple it. For example, they recently deleted hundreds of readers' copies of 1984 without their permission. Amazon's advertising is deceptive, because it doesn't specify exactly what they can do to your Kindle or to the books you've purchased. This might be a good product if the purchaser really had control over it."
3,Handy knowledge improver,"I feel thrilled in having a kindle. It has more than what I expected like Dictionary, Music listening ,and notes writing. It is easy to carry and you are forced to read when you have little time in between jobs also.It would be great if the display is in color. Love to have pictures since it is not available in countries like INDIA. New experience coming with little more cost. Expecting some more features to be loaded quickly like allowing browsing in INDIA. Definitely feel great and it is a good buy."
4,A great product with some room for improvement,"I have had the Kindle 2 for about 3 weeks and have completely enjoyed it! Reading from it is easy and navigation a snap once you get the hang of it. I am a pastor, so I have started using the Kindle from which to read my sermon notes when I preach! Again, I have had no problem reading from the Kindle as I speak and have found it most useful in this context. Thanks, Amazon!Improvements would include the option of low-level backlighting, the addition of color and a touch screen."
4,Kindle coming along,I love the new Kindle. I just wish it had a touch screen so I could write on it and make notes on pages without having to type them out.
5,My Kindle,"I did lots of research on the internet and in stores looking at different e-book readers. I even bought the wife one to see how she would like it before buying one for me. I gave her Kindle as a Christmas present and within in a week after working with it, I decided to buy my own. Its easy to use. Features are great. I travel all over the U.S. and have never had a problem with the signal or abilty to download books. The electronic print clarity is truly amazing. When on an airplane, passengers next to me always ask how I like it and I tell them without hesitation that this was the best purchase I've made in a while. I'm able to download and read business books as well as pleasure books. I really like the highlighting feature as it lets me go back and review key points in the book. I would definitely recommend this to my family and friends."
5,Kindle Review,I received my Kindle as a Christmas present. I do not know much about computers and was a little worried that I would not be able to operate the Kindle. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use! I have read more books since it is so easy to buy the books. I love how you get to sample a good amount of the book too. I just ordered a cover for it since I plan on taking it on my next vacation.I would highly recommend the Kindle to any book lover and even people like me who are not tech savvy!!
4,I love this product!,"I first heard about the Kindle on the 'View' when Whoopi Goldberg spoke about it; I have been wanting to buy it since then. I waited over a year to decide if I really wanted it and when the Kindle 2 came out, I just couldn't resist. It's been a month now that I have been using the Kindle 2 and I have to say that I am very impressed with the device! It's not only convenient and easy to use but makes reading a lot more fun! It's worth every penny I spent on it and I highly recommend it to anyone that's still making up their mind about buying it."
4,I love it!,"I wanted Kindle but talked myself out of it....then Kindle 2 came along and I could not wait any longer.It is even more than I had expected. I have read inside, outside, in the car, in bed; it is wonderful. I find I can read longer as it is so light. The Kindle 2 is remarkably easy to use. I was too anxious to read the directions and was able to use it without any instruction. (I might read the instructions now as there might be more in store for me I don't know about yet.)If you have been putting off your purchase.....don't! You need to order it today."
1,poor service,I liked the kindle well enough but when I was showing it to some friends one of them ordered 2 books I did not want so I sent an e-mail to the department the instructions told me to - of course I never got a reply from anyone but you people sure don't hesitate to send me e-mails almost daily as to what I should purchase. Since then we have not purchased any more books and probably won't - the whole experiance speaks volumes about your business.
1,very NOT friendly WORLD EDITION...,can amazon explain to me if you plan to sell a WORLD EDITION.. and myself living on the WORLD.. besides USA.. !!!cant get the latest book because of my IP (in other word.. and world.. )?????!!
3,Possible product improvement,This product has the framework for unlimited potential. I fail to however to enjoy the crinkly paper feel of books and the sound the paper makes when you turn the page.
2,Focus Groups on page turning buttons?,Why haven't they moved the buttons so that unintended page turning isn't a problem when lying in bed or holding the kindle in a comfortable position. Other than this major design flaw I can zip through books on a kindle. Speed reading is much easier for me on this device.
5,Kindle Unit,Received as promised ! Love the Kindle as it is more versitile than I first thought. I bought it for my wife's Birthday present and she is so happy with it. Thank You!!
1,DRM is so 20th century,"I refuse to buy this product until it removes DRM. I will not ""rent"" the books I purchase. Thanks for listening!"
3,Connectivity,"I bought the k1 almost 2 years ago. I loved the idea of the whispernet. Being able to browse a bookstore like amazon from my home.Of course, if you live in a small town you do not actually get this. The whispernet coverage was non existent. I had to drive 10 miles into larger town to connect. May as well drive to the bookstore.I do not know if the kindle 2 has a different level of coverage but I have not used my K1 in about a year."
5,Great Product,I have never seen such a wonderfull product. You can pack all your subscriptions and books on a single platform and carry them away to every place you go.
5,very pleased.,I purchased the kindle for my husband's birthday after seeing a special on it from Amazon.com. The purchase was easy and quick and he loves it!
1,Kindle 2 picked the worst of the 3G's to ride on,I purchased the Kindle 2 for my husband's birthday. He spent a whole day trying to get it to connect and after speaking with tech support for many hours discovered that the 3G is Sprint which does not work in the area we live in. I don't why Amazon didn't make an agreement with ATT or Verizon for this e-book reader - most likely could have sold many more units. So beware - check the coverage map for Sprint before you buy. I was fortunate in that I was able to regift this item to someone who does have coverage where they live.
1,Returned it Immediately,"If you are used to refined design and a great user experience, don't buy this product. I returned mine an hour after I got it. An ebook with no back light? no touch sensitive screen, HORRIBLE tiny keyboard. Small display - It simply sucks. It could have been so great.I'm very disappointed. I really wanted to stop buying paper books. Whoever designed this obviously has never used an iPhone. I guess I'm once again back to waiting for Apple to do this right."
1,Really poor design,"I had the first-generation Kindle, which unfortunately died in a water accident. I put off buying the new generation Kindle (not DX) for a long time, but finally succumbed, since I had so many books stored already in my archive and didn't want to lose them.I got the new Kindle today and its navigation feature -- one button -- sucks. You have to press in just the right zone, with the tip of your fingernail, on a tiny square button to get it to go in the direction you want. After five minutes of pressing and hitting the ""back"" button, I finally got to my archive of books. Worth it? Totally not.I wish I'd gotten an iPad."
4,"Pretty nice reader, could use a couple tweaks","Overall, pretty nice. Positives:- Easy / fast downloads- E-mailing my own PDFs & docs to it works well- Good text viewabilityNegatives:- It ***REALLY*** needs a concept of folders for organizing materials- Downloaded images can be difficult to view- On the right side, it's easy to press home when you want page up- A tiny bit slow (but not bad)"
4,Love It,"I have been wanting a e-book reader for a few years. I am glad that I waited. I love my Kindle 2. It is just the right size to go into my purse and to carry around. My daughter and all my friends want one now. I wish that you could do more in organizing the way I would like to organize the authors last name first. I also have a book list of the books I own on my home computer, and yes I know I could put them on my Kindle, but I would not be able to update it on the Kindle."
4,Cool device,"Pretty cool toy. Easy to read, downloads are a snap. Tempting to buy all sorts of books while browsing the bookstore. This will definitely increase my reading of books but may decrease my use of books from the library so: more money spent on reading. My kids want to use it all the time."
4,Pretty Darn Good,"I have owned this Kindle for just a couple of weeks but have read 2 books on it already and it has been great for using while commuting. Downloading books seems flawlessly easy. If it continues living up to the way it has started out, I'll be most pleased with this product."
4,Kindle Book Reader,"Nicely packaged item, with a simple 'Getting Started' guide. A nice change from the huge manuals shipped with other devices.The supplied cable comes with a USB to US mains adapter, so recharging in the UK can only initally be done by connecting to a USB socket on a PC. I bought a UK charger for about 5 from EBay.The device can also play talking books and read existing e-books in a synthetic voice with dubious internation. The Kindle can also play mp3 files, but only in the order which they are loaded and without showing which files are present.The online Kindle store looks fairly extensive, although not obviously easy to browse the range of books."
5,nana_sewing's new love,"I got the Kindle for myself. I just love it. It really has given me so much joy. It is sooo easy to use. Downloading books is so simple. Just a click of the mouse. If you like to read, this is for you. My husband thought that I would get rid of the books that I already have, and I said ""are you kidding??"". Nothing will ever replace the feel of a book in your hands, but the Kindle sure comes close. We went to the beach and I took it out and started reading exactly where I had left off. I only wish I had more money to get all the books I want. I hope Amazon keeps offering free and inexpensive books. The $9.99 price for new books is fair, but when you go to purchase older books, it would be nice if the price would come down.The best thing is that if everyone used a Kindle, it would save the Earth alot of trees. That alone is a wonderful reason to get the Kindle!"
5,Everyone needs a Kindle!,"I never thought I would love the Kindle as much as I do. I thought I would miss the feel of a book, but the kindle is so light, thin and easy to hold, I am a convert. Being able to adjust text size is great too - I can leave my reading glasses off. I find myself reading more than ever. Only fault so far is that I cannot get Barbara Pym books yet. But I keep hoping they will be added soon."
5,Nimble Kindle,"I LOVE my Kindle. I treated myself for Mother's Day this year!My DIL loaned me hers for a few weeks, and when I had to return it, I was bereft, and was going into serious withdrawal.The BEST thing about my Kindle is the ""download-books-anywhere"" feature. My friends that have other brands have to be tethered to a computer to get something, and they envy my freedom.I also really appreciate the text size change capability; after sitting in front of a computer all day, my eyes are tired, and I can just bump up the point size and get on with it!Also, when I travel, I don't have to carry all those dead trees with me!! What could be better?Thank you, Amazon!"
3,Price should come down,I agree with the reviewer who said that it is about time for the price to come down. It has not gotten lower since it was first released a few years ago. It does seem as though the price should be under $300 by now.
4,Beware on the replacement insurance,They will promise next day replacement but it has been two weeks and no new kindle nor any updates.It is a third party company so take notes on who you talk with and their promises.
5,Encourages Me To Read More,I got the Kindle because I need to read quite a few .pdf files for work. Now I convert the .pdf's into the Kindle format using Calibre and scan through them without having to be in front of the computer monitor. That alone makes the Kindle worth the money for me.The interface felt comfortable to me quickly and the build quality seems high.
5,"LOVE, LOVE LOVE...",THIS IS THE BEST PURCHASE I HAVE MADE FOR MYSELF I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED READING AND MY NEW KINDLE IT HAS TAKED MY READING TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL...I LOVE IT SO I HAVE NOW PURCHASED E-BOOKS AFTER I HAVE THE ACTUAL BOOKS.... I AM PLANNING ON PRUCHASING TWO FOR MY GIRLS FOR CHRISTMAS IT I CAN WAIT THAT LONG TO GIVE IT TO THEM....THANK YOU!!!!
5,Kindle is Great,The KINDLE is unquestionably the best new product since sliced bread...and whatever preceded sliced bread...It makes reading a pleasure.The only negative is we keep buying Kindle books.
5,Six Stars!!!,"I knew that I would love the Kindle when it was originally introduced, but I decided to wait for the inevitable Version 2. This is an incredible device! I already possess a library containing over 1500 bound volumes and certainly don't need any more hard or soft cover books! Now I can carry a digital library with me wherever I go.I've noticed that I could read for hours and my eyes don't fatigue as quickly as when I read on paper, there's also less eye strain. When I travel I can bring scores of publications with me, with a combined weight of only a mere 10 ounces. Additionally, I'm thrilled that I'm able conserve by not adding to the continual degradation to the environment.The technology is amazing with features I never thought possible. Great job Amazon, five stars just didn't seem adequate enough to express the enthusiasm I have for my Kindle.Dr. Glenn GeroHolistic Naturopathic CenterClifton, NJ"
3,The end of Kindle....1/27/10,Ipad is on it's way for a minimum of 499.00 with Ibooks. Sorry Kindle you better pack up your bags and ride into the sunset.
3,$70 Less Two Months After I Get Mine?!?!,I received my Kindle for my birthday mid-April and now they drop the price $70 within two months? I guess it's clear they were overcharging by a ridiculous margin. I like the Kindle. I've read a lot of books on it in the last two months and it performs as it should. But I have to admit I'm a bit peeved by the price drop so soon after receiving mine.
2,no back-light-,"It is hard to believe that in 2009, anyone would make an electronic device without a back-lighted screen. This is the only one that I know of."
3,Tell me when the price is below $200,Tell me when the price is below $200. $150 would be better. But three hundred is too much for a single purpose device. I really like the kindle I think it will do wonders for global literacy. But I am sure that your working on it but the price needs to come down. Moore's law isn't working fast enough for me...
3,Just OK ...,"I was so looking forward to the Kindle and I am just not that crazy about it ... It is not that easy to work with, as I often move ahead inadvertently to the next page and then I have to put it in reverse. I have read one book and I would love to sell it. It is in perfect condition - I got it for Christmas 2009, I then purchased a nice ""protec"" case for it, etc. But it just is not all that for me. It is a lukewarm toy but really not very satisfying. A book has a lot more personality to me for some reason ... Maybe when they add color it will be much more interesting. The large print option is nice for tired eyes. If you want to purchase my Kindle please email me -I threw out the original packaging but I have all of the components and it's new case where it is currently living - [...]"
1,Nice -- While It Worked,"Kindle was great while it worked (several months). Sadly, it spazzed out yesterday -- the battery was dead, so I recharged. Instead of coming back-- as it had always done in the past -- only about half the screen was visible (or, more accurately, semi-visible); the other half was a mess of horizontal and vertical lines (what others with the same problem have called a plaid-like pattern). Re-setting, re-charging, r-buttoning doesn't do a thing. It's essentially dead. And I don't recall dropping it any time recently. It was in my car for a while, so maybe it got jostled to death. Anyway, it's way too fragile. My next step, I think, is the iPad."
3,kindle,Love the portability and ease of downloading books. The buttons are not very sensitive and sometimes it is difficult to get the action button to work.
3,Kindle Review JAP,"I've enjoyed using my Kindle but have some serious reservations about it which would stop me recommending it to anyone else:1. The non-availablity of books I want to read - seems to be mainly US publishers of not very serious works.2. The proliferation of competing products all signing exclusive deals with different publishers limits availability from any one product supplier (eg, Amazon) - in effect creating a standards war.3. The keyboard is a bit of a joke4. I had expected to be able search the web(googleand wikipedia). The non-availability of this service was not highlighted when I was purchasing for South African delivery.J Pearce"
5,kindle review,I love my kindle it is the best. I love being able to just download a book instead of going to the store to buy them. It takes up a lot less space then all those books. It is a great product.
4,much better then kindle 1,my wife took my kindle so i got this one for her instead. the menu structure is pretty non-sensical but the thing works well. i havent tried the sony but it looks a lot cooler. i wonder what the new apple tablet will do in this category. functional and that's all i need it for.... for now
5,Kindle - AMAZING,"I bought this for my daughter in college who loves to read. Perfect gift in two ways. She can get titles at a fraction of the cost instantly using nationwide network. She can get her textbooks from U of Wisconsin right on her kindle at a greatly reduced price. It pays for itself in the first semester.The size and feel of the Kindle is ""Apple-like."" Even the cover makes you just want to hold it. Wow. What a technical addition and a personal gift/tool for anyone."
4,I love my Kindle,"I love the ease of shopping and downloading new books. Also, having control of font size, allows me to read books with or without reading glasses.Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)"
4,My Wife's Kindle,"I gave the Kindle to my wife as a late idea Christmas gift not being sure how she's like it. She very ""low-tech"" and tends to shy away from gadgets. Well once I did the easy setup and loaded a book she picked, it's never far from her favorite reading spot. She says it's her favorite gift ever. It really does seem low-tech in spite of how high-tech it really is. Only one suggestion I'd make- add a backlight feature so reading in the dark could be an option. Otherwise, great product!"
4,Almost perfect,"This gadget is awesome, it has almost everything:- Ease to use.- Great autonomy (~ 4 days with the wireless ON, and more than 7 days in OFF)- Very compact (I can even carry on my pants, it is not recommended but is possible).- The wireless coverture is excellent, I live in Guadalajara, México and from time to time I travel to another towns in Jalisco, I have service in those places.But, there are two missing things:- Home really, really should have a way to separate the books; I mean, it is not practical to have hundred of books and navigate with next and previous page. Maybe there is something that i need to investigate about, but if there is, it is not easy to find.- It doesn't read PDF nativelly, you should send your documents to Amazon and then transfer it to the kindle. But not always the conversion is good, I have done it a couple of times and most of them the documents were un-readable."
4,no back light,"I really DO love this Kindle of mine. I didn't think I would because I love to hold my physically books and turn the pages, keep them and reread them. But this is wonderful and I use it everyday, everywhere. It's slim enough and light enough to fit right into my purse. The ONLY reason I did not give it a 5 star rating was because I wish there was a ""night time"" option on it. I love to curl up in bed and read, however usually my husband is trying to sleep and no matter how 'dim' a book light I use it's still bothersome for both of us. I really do with there was a back light button available."
3,Kindle,There are significant shortcomings in the reduced functionality of the internet connection which are frustrating.The release of many books without an index is just poor publishing and amazon should be setting minimum standards before accepting books in this format.The presentation of tables in a reduced intensity makes reading them very difficult a bolder type face is required or a different method of display.The reading time is ok but i am unable to plug the USB connection into the standard usb wall plug outlet as it does not charge. Subscribing to a universal standard would be nice.
3,Disappointing UK content,"Having waited eagerly while all my American friends raved about their Kindles, I bought one as soon as Global Wireless became available. Silly me, I figured that since the device is only available from amazon.com in the US, and since downloads are priced in US$, I must have available the same downloads at the same prices as you would have in the US. I don't think so. At least so far, book selection is uneven and a bit weird and pricing is all over the map. I am hoping this improves, but for now am a bit disappointed with my purchase as only about one in four books that I had in mind to download was actually available.Love the device though. Easy to use, easy to carry around in my briefcase. In that respect, just what I was hoping for."
4,"Kindle 6"", Global","Received the Kindle for Christmas 2009. Very excited and downloaded a couple books that day. The navigation is somewhat hokie, but overall it is a great product. A major improvement would be the clarity of pictures and drawings. These do not resize with the font change. However, love the device."
4,electric book,"I was able to buy a book same day as I received the kindle .So ,the initial reaction was very favourable .Till I found that I couldnt transfer my ""personal documents down through the computer to my kindle .I managed one photo jpeg but nowt else .Am still trying without success at putting little pieces of documents onto the kindle .I use an imac computer10.5.8. Also the reception isnt all that great in my rural area which I accept will never be as good as the ""dark brown ""areas around big cities (Melbourne/Geelong in Australia).Otherwise I look forward to a long relationship with my Kindle .Great invention"
5,I am a convert!!,"I never thought I would say this but I love my Kindle 2 electronic reader. I am a dyded in the wool book-a-holic and thought I would never give up hard and paperbacks. My hubby bought me my Kindle for Christmas and I am converted. It is so easy to use, I love everything about it, even the instructions were easy to read!! The pink leather case is the finishing touch. I have downloaded 3 books so far and find it great for reading in bed as it is light and page turning at the press of a thumb is easy. I want it to me available in the UK as soon as possible in order to get some of my favourite authors on Kindle.Couple of things; can't seem to find a backlight for night reading? Not sure how to archive books I have read but will carry on learning as I go on. Great gift, I love my Kindle!!!"
4,Kindle,"Love it, it is so easy to use and holds HEAPS of books.Wish it had a backlight function that you could turn on when reading in bed at night but I havent put it down since I bought it."
4,Good for reading in large print,"I use the Kindle because I have limited vision. I wanted to be able to read books that aren't available in large print. The Kindle allows me to increase the font size of any book available through the Kindle store. My children are helping me learn to use it. I need some help from people with better eyesight. I'm looking forward to the software upgrade that will offer two larger font sizes. Unfortunately, the keys are very small and the menus are not in large font sizes. One real plus is the light weight and the large number of titles available."
5,Fantastic way to read; especially when you are on the road.,It is easy to use; I like the way you can make the font bigger and that you can have the book read to you if you don't feel like reading.Just wish there were color pictures instead of the black and white but I realize that that would take up too much memory. But I really love it and chose it over the Nook because of the way it felt and looked.
5,Kindle,"I am very happy with my Kindle, so far. I really like being able to get a book whenever I want, or wherever I am. I do wish I'd bought a cover for it, but that can come later.Thanks!"
5,First time Kindle user - but experienced ebook user,"I was a very early adopter of ebooks - having several PDAs with ebook software and a heavy user of the Rocket eBook. I had the Kindle software on my iPhone and iTouch, so for my birthday gift - I was thrilled to move to the Kindle 2.My initial impression is I love it. I was happy with the iPhone/Touch - but the larger screen is invaluable. Especially as I am a knitter, I love being able to send patterns to it to carry with my reading.There are some quirks I would like to see addressed in a future version -- even my old Rocket eBook was backlit - nice for all of the nights I was up late with my babies!- the screen refresh is a bit blinky- they green/grey background is a little distracting - the option for white would be nice- put some of the common symboles on the keyboard like @ and -.I may have more overtime, but I can tell this will quickly be a device that I will always have with me. I'm extremly please with my new Kindle."
1,My Kindle,"My husband bought me my Kindle for my birthday. I've been wanting one for the longest time. I mainly wanted it for work, so I could listen to books while I worked at the same time. Dissapointed when I started listing to the books. I couldn't keep up with the electronic reader. I also couldn't download books in spanish and I usually like to read before I go to sleep, but this Kindle doesn't have a back light. So I end up returning my Kindle and bought an Ipod touch instead."
5,I don't like it...I LOVE it!!!!,"I didn't think I'd like the Kindle. I'm an avid reader who loves the feel of a book in my hands. I never really thought of portability as a problem. My husband got me the Kindle for Christmas and I am SO HOOKED!! I have found that because of the font and color of the screen you forget that you aren't holding a paperback in your hand. And never again will I go on a plane with a sore back because I have six paperbacks weighing me down! I have well over 70 books on my Kindle, and I add more daily! Really a wonderful device!!!"
5,kindle reader is new to me,"I can put this kindle reader in my pocket book for on the go reading. I am not a advid reader but with this kindle, i have read more this December 2009 than i have all year.Kindle is easier to carry than a paper back. global 6inch kindle is great, buy it you may like it as much as i do."
1,"I love electronic books, but . . .","How could they have such a Rube Goldberg system for attaching a cover? The Kindle concept is great. The design, from an electronic technology standpoint, is great. The image and readability of the screen is great. The method for attaching the Kindle to the Kindle cover sucks!The design of the system is so poor that they sent me an email explaining how to avoid cracking the case of the Kindle if I use a Kindle cover! I hope that the cover design and attachment system was created by a high school industrial arts class. It would be a shame if someone actually got paid for this design.I'm returning both the Kindle and the cover. Even if I am careful, I know that the case of the Kindle is going to crack eventually. I'm not taking any chances.But, I am sold on electronic books, so I am going to find one that has a better design."
3,Global NOT,I purchased the Global Kindle with the download anywhere feature. I love the product so far but Im really upset that I can see Kindle books available by my favorite British authors but when I try to download it not allowed outside of the UK. How can it be global when you can only download from USA! If the books are available in Kindle why cant we get them? I can purchase the printed version so what is the problem? I feel it false advertising to call something global and you can download anywhere when you really can't.One other point would be a lit up screen ability instead of having to purchase a light.
3,A Great item pity about the charging system,"A great unit, does exactly what it should, whisper net not contacting in Newcastle, Australia but the charging system here in Australia is not much good, a wall charger should have been supplied as not all wall chargers or computers will charge up this unit."
1,CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!! as well as the customer service.,"I bought 2 Kindles, as gifts, during their first year, paid over $700. My husband's crapped out after about 13 months, my mother's actually lasted 1 yr. and 7 months when it crapped out. Amazon told me the best they could do for me was a $25 credit towards a new one. They said that to get a replacement I should have requested one during the whomping 1 year warranty. I said: ""are you telling me that you EXPECTED them to crap out and that I was unlucky that mine crapped out outside the warranty?"" GARBAGE PRODUCT, GARBAGE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Hello Sony Reader!"
5,BEST EVER,"I love, love and love my Kindle. I listen to books while a drive to and from work. I listen while I walk.I read on the beach. I read in bed late at night. I am so happy I have my Kindle!"
4,Great EReader!,"I bought the Kindle about 6 months ago and have very much enjoyed it so far. I think it's a terrific product which allows me to read several books at once without having to carry several things around all the time. I carry it with me to/from work and anywhere else I go. Because it is so small, I can read during almost any commute without worrying about bookmarks, etc. Additionally, the screen is exactly like a traditional paperback which allows for long reading sessions without any eye strain (unlike a computer monitor/tv, etc.)The one area I wish it was better was online reading. It does not render webpages well, thus not allowing for easy reading on nytimes or rss sites. I assume Amazon wants you to pay for the news subscriptions for the kindle but given that they are free online, I do not want to pay for them!Overall, I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys reading, especially several books at once. I have bought one as a gift as well and the person loved it."
3,"So far, so good .....","After 3 weeks, I'm enjoying my Kindle. In particular, I like the portability, and the ablity to order a book when I want it - not when I can get to the store. (I travel weekly on business). Two observations -- I miss the ""feel"" of where you are in the book - almost finished, one third through, etc. You get no sense of that.- I am disappointed in the ""voice"" feature. The computer that reads the text (I understand that necessity) mispronounces words and names - It's the ""Hyze-man"" trophy, not the ""Heezman"", for Pete's sake .... You'd think that a human could enter some common names or keys for the computer or something.Anyway, I'll keep at it, and hope to get more comfortable with the features over time. One more plus - I like being able to easily adjust the font size for my fifty-something eyes. Well done!"
5,Miracle Kindle,"This has been a MIRACLE for me, as I am slowly going blind and love to read. I adjusted the size of type and voila, I can see the printed word. The light weight and slim KINDLE is absolutely the easiest ""book"" to enjoy that you could ever imagine - it's an absolute delight to read. I own a travel agency and am constantly on the move, so reading on trips is now not only possible, but a joy! The KINDLE help desk is always available to answer any questions and I can purchase new books whenever I feel like it. When my eyes tire I simply let KINDLE read to me. It's the best invention ever with more titles to browse thru than my library; who can ignore this go everywhere little phenom. Thank you AMAZON! I never leave home without my KINDLE... wanda"
5,The Amazing Amazon Kindle,"I work all over the world consulting to thr oil industry. As an avid reader it has always been a burden for me to carry enough books to last the length my trips, which are often up to one month. The weight saving on my flight baggage allowance alone, speaks for itself.For the past year I had been thinking about buying a electronic reader and had reviewed several others on the market. However when I read about the Kindle and the very fact that it can download hundreds of books, papers and magazines wirelessly, I knew there was no comparison and that this was the one for me.What I like about the Kindle is it's easy to use, fairly light, thin and can store hundreds of books at normally half the price you would pay in the book stores..I am curently working in Ghana and can still download from the thousands of Amazon books on offer.Thank you Amazon."
4,Barbara,"It would be nice if the kindle had back lighting for reading at night or airplane. Otherwise the product is very nice, easy to use, easy to download books. Very happy with the product."
5,So far so good!,"I received this as a christmas gift, and also mistakenly ordered it for myself (happy un-birthday to my daughter) I am enjoying this soo much. Haven't mastered the go/get arounds. Having had three shoulder surgerys, a bulge and bone spur in my neck, this 2nd generation Kindle is just the best thing."
1,Carefully read the TOS before purchasing,"Before you consider buying this product make sure to carefully review the terms of service. Amazon can (and in the past has) remotely disabled advertised features and deleted bought and paid for books from customer's Kindles without permission. Under the terms of service (which you must agree to in order to use the Kindle, Amazon reserves the right to remove purchased functionality and content at any time and for any or no reason without prior notification or customer consent. Just because a feature is advertised or a book is available now doesn't mean it won't disappear after you've paid for it."
1,"Really nifty, but highly restrictive",Ebook readers are an amazing technology and they are no doubt increasing in popularity. What I don't like about Kindle is that you don't actually own the content that you pay for. I'd rather own physical books that are owned by me and on my shelf! Amazon recently deleted all copies of Animal Farm and 1984. This technology is not trust worthy - it allows Amazon to delete your virtual books!
3,Wish I knew,"The Kindle was given to me as a gift by my husband. He knew how much I want an eReader, didn't know I wanted a specific one. What I wish I knew about the kindle, was that the free title they boast are classics that have been read and analyzed by us in high school and college. I also wish I knew that the kindle isn't compatible with a lot of the ebooks sites that offer free books with local libraries that have a program for ebook borrowing. I read quite alot so purchasing a book every time I want another read gets expensive. I read about 3 books a week, and was very excited to find out my local library has a virtual library so I can download bestsellers, and new releases; only to find out that Kindle is not compatible. However, the sony readers, ipods, ipads, pcs,android phones, and the barnes and noble nook are compatible."
3,Disappointment,"I was so excited to purchase the Kindle for my husband for Christmas. When I received the Kindle I was going to download a couple of books by my husbands favorite Author, and I soon learned I couldn't. If you are a John Grisham fan, you can't buy any of his books for your kindle. This is a very big disappointment and I think Amazon needs to let people know that certain Authors won't be available. I do think it's a very neat item and I do think my husband will enjoy it.I would like to know why certain Authors aren't available?Sincerely,Barbara"
1,Very dissappointed in Amazon!,"I bought my Kindle and have used it with great joy for several months. Last month the screen became disfigured. I have no idea how or why so I call Amazon, tell them about the problem and they REFUSE to even look at my device. According to them, based on my description it is ""broken not defective"" WHAT??? They offer to send me a refurbished devise for $99. No way..I asked Amazon to at least LOOK at my device, no they said ""we do this for a living and it is not covered under warranty."" Mechanics fix cars for a living but they still look at the engine to diagnose the problem.I was such a supporter of the Kindle - have told everyone they should buy one, now I will discourage anyone from this purchase. For a product that was $359 I expected better customer service.Sadly I cannot remain an Amazon customer and will take my business elsewhere. I think target has a compatible product...Farewell Amazon!"
5,Well worth the money,If you love to read books this will make your life so much easier. If you travel or are always out of the house and dont want to lug a bunch of books around this is for you. I absolutely love mine I just hope they get more books for the kindle!
4,Love my Kindle,"It's all I can do not to make out with my Kindle because I love it so much! I am amazed at how much I am using my Kindle. The battery life is astounding - I have only charged it once, and have read upwards of 15 hours with virtually no drain. The *only* thing I'm not liking is that I can't pass books on to friends after I read them."
3,speaker froze and the light not that great,"I just got my kindle a week ago I like it, but I can't said I love it, one reason when I turn my speaker on sometimes is froze and I have to turn the kindle off and try again, I really don""t like that, and the light is not that great to read at night time if you don't have a light that is really bright forget it, so now I have to spend more money on a light for Kindle."
5,kindle reader,"Good decision to buy. Am enjoying reading even more than usual, plus planning some ""must reads"" I've not gotten to over the years. No glare problems at all and the portability is wonderful. Sorry I waited so long to purchase it. Holds its charge incredibly long and recharges very quickly...definitely a must."
4,scratched but great,My kindle showed up finally and it's everything I wanted it to be and more! The only problem I found is there are two scratches on the top left corner after it just came out of the box! Its not worth waiting another few weeks to return but other then that. A MUST HAVE
5,Pricing,"I love my Kindle 2nd generation. I can't imagine being without it. Having said that, I must tell you that when I purchased my first Kindle it was weeks before the first price reduction. I have had my new Kindle a few short weeks and now there has been another huge price reduction. I called and asked for a credit and was told no. Too bad, but there would be no credits by Amazon for recent purchases prior to the price reduction.With more competition coming from other sources this policy by Amazon will cause me to look long and hard at other products the next time I purchase a new device.Sincerely,Richard Greenlawpspdick@dc.rr.com"
5,electronic reader,I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who is seriously in the market for this type of item. This is the best thing that is on the market. I love to read constantly & do to temporary medical problems I am not able to get to the library.Having this product puts reading right at my fingertips. You can search for any book you are looking for plus there are subscriptions to newspapers & magazines. The nice feature is that before you purchase the book you can sample the first 3 chapters to see whether you actually want to purchase the book.If you make this purchase I can definitely say that you will not be sorry.
3,kindle 2 international not ready for european market,"I got the international version of the kindle yesterday.It works fine in IrelandHowever I went to buy 6 books in the kindle store. All of them were available as kindle books but only 1 is currently available for the european market!!!I then discovered that the range of magazines and newspapers available is very poor.This is not good enough,Amazon. You are misleading your customers by releasing this product in this manner."
2,Repair Needed,"I ordered my Kindle in January and it worked just fine until July when I got the message: ""Kindle needs repair"" when I turned it on.I called the customer service department and was told that there was no repair for this error message, and that would be sending me another one since it is within in warranty period. Needless to say, I was very disappointed because I was on vacation. The replacement is supposed to arrive today at my home."
3,It is what it is,it is what it is and it does what it says it will do. what else do you need to know?
2,"I had more expectation about this device, it's simple on nowadays basic technological options...","I'm a Doctor. It will be an useful device, but... Why just 1.4 - 2 Gb on internal memory? Where is the SD card Reader? Can I change the operational language(multilanguage option)? Why it's not an Touch Screen Device? Why can't I take notes with a digital pen? Why only Black and White colors on the screen? Give us more, please... We will be grateful!"
1,Bad practice,"Love the Kindle 2. Excellent product. Bought two just last month and we love them.However, I can't help but be frustrated by a company that sold them to me a month ago for $140 more than they will sell it to a customer today. No warning of a drastic reduction in price, no offer of rebates or discounts for the loyal customer who paid much more, no communication of any kind.Sour grapes, sure. Lesson learned, hopefully. My fault.Great product, bad company practice. Frustrating.Dr. Alan Wimberley"
3,Can't get the books I want!,"I like the idea of having a library that I can put in my hand bag - but I find it frustrating that the books that I would like to down load are not available. Ie - Love reading Julian May (a Sci Fi author) ""Many Coloured Land"" series, or Robin Hobb books. Will more books be made available ?"
5,Completely Satisfied with my Kindle,"I am satisfied with my Kindle. It does everything it is advertised to do,and does it well. I hope in future software updates it permits the Kindle to read epub format directly instead of going through an additional step with Calibre on the PC.Hats off to Amazon."
4,Yes but.... International buyers read on,"Liebe Interessenten aus Deutschland,ein schönes Gerät, tolle Features, erfüllt seinen Zweck mehr als gut. Also: go get it! But do it while in the States!Beim Versand nach Deutschland kassiert Amazon zum Preis weitere ca. 55 Dollar, der deutsche Zoll möchte zusätzlich noch sage und Schreibe 63 Euro! Also überlege man sich die internationale Bestellung gut.And now for all the rest of us: it is indeed the reading device one has been waiting for, if only for the opportunity to donload books wirelessly. However, shipping charges to Europe are way too high, and customs demand about one third of the original price. So buy it only while in the US, or keep on dreaming :-)"
5,A Total Convert,"I have been a lover of books and big reader for years. I am in 2 book clubs and never thought I could give up that wonderful feeling of a book in your hands. I am completely converted by the Kindle. It's light, hold tons of books, has an incredible dictionary feature that is very easy to use, and simulates book reading beautifully. I am so surprised, I find myself convincing others to make the switch, especially if you travel a lot and love to read. Many classics are only $0.99! I love it."
4,Easy to use,"Easy to use interface, easy to download books too. Have recommended the Kindle to several of my friends. It is a great product if you like to read books, otherwise it makes a nice gadget to collect dust."
4,"great gift, says dd!",Bought for daughter - at her request. She loves it but thinks it requires too-often recharge.
4,One minor problem.........,"First of all, I want to say this device is fantastic!!! It definitely lives up to it's specs.The only drawback I have seen is that there is no form of password protection for the K2. Anyone can pick it up, turn it on, and see what's in there.I have nothing to hide, mind you, but it is very disturbing to know that someone could go into the Kindle Store through my K2 and download anything they wanted into my Kindle. All they would have to do is select which credit card I want it charged to (conveniently displayed by Amazon.com on the Kindle). There is nothing to ensure that I am indeed the one who is ordering the downloads, and understandably disputing such downloads would be difficult.This needs to be addressed as soon as possible!"
5,great invention,purchased this for my daughter who buys around 10 books a month and she loves it. It is the best invention and not to have to carry several books with you is a plus by its self.The Kindle is really easy to use even young children can use it. I was so impressed with it I want to purchase one for myself
4,clarity,"It would be easier to read if the background of the text was whiter.Especially for older readers don't need larger print, but more contrast and light."
5,miraculous,"the kindle speaks for itself. we have never had anything like it before. i am 75 years old and have beencollecting books since i was 10 with a little over 2000 books, all old friends, treasures each. my sleeklittle kindle is capable of containing 3500 ! ! ! books. my goal is to fill it BEFORE i am shelved."
5,What A Product!!!,I purchased the Kindle as a gift for my wife who is a voracious reader.She and I are absolutley thrilled with it!A technology gadget that meets all the hype and expectations anyone could have.
4,bookmark problem,"I have enjoyed the Kindle, but I'm am not pleased with the bookmark feature. It never seems to go back to the correct place.When I am finished reading, I now write the location numbers down on a separate piece of paper. It is kind of a pain as Idon't always have my same piece of paper handy. Jeanie"
3,"6"" is not enough for reading.","I have recently bought Kindle and i must say that i was not completely satisfied from the 6"" inches display.It was too small. You could say that it was my choice.Yes but when i find out that i cannot change the font size in PDF documents or even zoom, ... i just couldn't read.If they could fix those two drawbacks, i realy don't mind the small display.A very good product at purchasing a new ebook, very simple and easy."
3,kindle,"I love reading on the Kindle, however, I now realize that I should have bought the nook. Kindle does not get a lot on new books when they first come out. I am very disapointed especially when I go to the nook website and they have the books. With this in mind I recomend the nook over the kindle.Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)"
3,Its cool but i've already had trouble with the kindle,"i totally enjoyed it first but soon after i had it for like a week i had problems. the music stopped working, the alt k did not work and i hate the fact that your not able to go back to a previous song or able to pick and choose. now when i plug it in i have to jiggle the cord so that the light turns on. i also don't like the fact that it only comes in white. but still i enjoy it because i don't have to bring like 10 books with me all the time. i have it all conveniently in one small package. i also wish that the screen had the ability to light up so that you could read in the dark."
4,kindle is great,"Kindle was given to me as a birthday gift and i absolutely love it. it feels great in my hands and i can read for hours. i love the adjustable text size and the text to speech function. i do however miss the lack of the indicator dots on the F and J keys that I've been used to having on all keyboards. i would also like the screen to be slightly larger. i love the overall size of the Kindle and think that Amazon should take full advantage of the real estate available to them. i know I'm being nit-picky,but other then that kindle is great. It's super easy to use and i would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an e-reader."
5,Exceptional Technology,"This device surpassed my expectations. It is as close to reading a book, magazine, or newspaper as I have ever found. I find that it is less cumbersome than other tablet computers, due to it's unique design which is completely dedicated to reading. This is truly the most user-friendly device for people who like to read. Personally, my favorite feature is having any newspaper, magazine, or book delivered to my kindle whenever I want. I just read the NY Times and the Irish Times today."
5,This Kindle is amazing,"The Kindle reader is an amazing device I find that with it's small size and low weight with a long battery life it's easy to take with you everywhere you go. I use it everywhere, from on the bus ride to and from work everyday, on the train or plane when going on a business trip or away for the weekend it's small enought to fit in the carry on. The fact you can read the kindle in direct sunlight makes it even more wonderful. The books I've downloaded were all downloaded very quickly and are easy to read.Over all this product was a great purchase and going forward I'll be using it alot more."
5,Great gift,This is a gift for my daughter. She reads books frequently and I wasn't sure if she would like this. But as it turns out she loves the Kindle. It works just as advertised!
4,The only way to read,The kindle reader is the only way to read. Easy to use and cheaper than buying books from a retailer.
4,Awesome & Innovative eReader,"I received my 2nd Generation Amazon Kindle just prior to Christmas. I absolutely love it. I have always enjoyed reading. The Kindle makes reading such an awesome experience. I read more now than ever, which as a nurse I know will help me keep my mind sharp. I enjoy being able to have my new book in under a minute but I especially love the ability to be able to sample a few chapters prior to making my purchase. You are able to change the font size or have the ereader read aloud to you either with a male or female voice, if the book offers speech to text. You can search the web and send and receive emails all with 3G capability. I NEVER have trouble connecting. There is no monthly fee or subscription to access the internet. It's comfortable to hold and easy on the eyes and it's portablility makes it perfect to take with you anytime, anywhere! I am on my way to the beach with my Kindle in hand to have my perfect day!"
5,I love this,This is the best e-reader on the market! I have looked into others and this one makes it the most like reading a book.
4,Kindle 2,"Like it a lot. Easy to read, easy to download new selections. Hope the next page buttons are long lived since they get used a lot. Since I travel a lot, it saves lots of space and weight. No need to pack a dozen paperbacks for a two week trip.One big minus - no place to put your name or contact info. Assuming an honest person finds a lost Kindle there is nothing to tell them who it belongs to or how to contact them.The only clue is the name of the book when it is turned on and a first name is not much help at all."
3,Great Device except for tiny screen,"The screen is 6 inches diagonally. To put in perspective it's the height of an iphone and 50% wider. I felt like I was constantly turning the page with the font set to the smallest available. I really like the concept and how it works, I just think the screen should be the size of a normal paper back. I have no desire to read a book on an iphone or anything close."
2,After looking at both Ipad and Kindle,I decided to buy Ipad. It is a multipurpose device that is light weight and had long battery> I enjoy the nice color screen that Kindle does not provide. And if you really want to buy an ebook from amazon you can do still do so on Ipad but not the other way around.
1,"good idea, bad implementation","Kindle could be a great product. But for that to happen it should display books as they were meant to be displayed, that is, with the original page design, colors, typography and original page numbers. Until that happens I will choose to read Google Books online, or Safari Books online, and the like."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"Although I like the Kindle2, I highly disapprove of the way Amazon has marketed this product...I updated from Kindle 1 to Kindle2 and was never told that the new Kindle DX was just 6 weeks away from being marketed...In less than 6 wks of purchase, my ""new"" Kindle2 is now obsolete! Because it's over 30 days from purchase, I can't trade-in and update to the new Kindle DX....SHAME ON YOU, AMAZON....I feel that your company has let down a good customer and I will hesitate ordering from you again!!"
5,Never thought I would love it so much!,"I am in love with Kindle. I used to poo-poo it, saying I prefer turning pages, blah blah blah. It turns out turning pages and holding up heavy novels, especially in bed where I do much of my reading, was actually just a pain-in-the-you-know-what, I just didn't realize it. I now know better. Kindle is lightweight, easy to read, and addictive. I read much faster on the Kindle (which could turn out to cost me more money in the amount of books I'll be ordering). I always hated the material waste of traditional books and I'm not a bookshelf person; I hate clutter, so this feels right for my personality.The only drawback to Kindle I've noticed thus far is the lack of foreign language titles. I really want to read some Isabelle Allende in Spanish; I think it would be great to be able to click on any words I'm not sure about and get a translation. This isn't a big enough drawback that I would knock a star off the rating, but it is a bit of a bummer."
1,Buy a book instead,"I find it indefensible that Amazon can remotely delete the contents of your Kindle. Stand up against proprietary software, programs and devices. It's yours. Use it. Buy a book.Amazon - you should be ashamed."
5,John & Elizabeth's Review,Elizabeth took the kindle on our trip to Egypt for 3 weeks. It was ideal as it fitted in hand luggage and was easily accessible at all times - on the plane and in the hotels. We had pre-loaded 4 books so there was no shortage of reading material. We had a laptop computer with us so it was easy to keep the battery charged.We found the Kindle to be a great alternative to carrying a supply of books which in the past had taken up space and increased our baggage weight.
5,Great Experimental Feature,"After receiving my Kindle for Christmas this year, I found that I really like tolisten to music while I read. Although this feature is experimental, it worksgreat for me when using my Kindle is noisy environments such as Bob Evan's onSaturday mornings or at home in the living room in the evenings.I can't wait for my favorite book author's next book to hit the market in Kindle formatso I can read it on my new Kindle. At this time, I am reading the Detroit News paper.This is my way of staying current, even though, they no longer offer a hard copyof this newspaper to my home on a daily basis.Please consider keeping this device simple. This device is not in competition withother devices like the Hero phone. It does not need GPS, e-mail, etc.....Thanks, Gail"
5,A reader's dream come true !!!,I absolutely love my Kindle. I recommend it to everyone I know. Now if only the books could be a little less expensive ...
3,Wireless NOT,"After receiving my KInlde I couldn't wait to get to reading. Low and behold I happen to be in the non wispernet area. Meaning I had to use my computer to transfer my books to the Kindle. Our house is wireless. Laptops/SONOS, all things electronic that could be wireless. Had no idea that the Kindle would not have an option to use a current wireless environment as an option in case their coverage was not available! Who would have thunk???Next generation.... this is almost like going back to dial up! Time to get a techie on this asap. I'll keep the Kindle, but I'm not overyly excited about it anymore. Hope there's an update soon to fix the a very big technology gap."
4,"It's Great, yeah - but","I have had my Kindle for about 5 months now. And my initial crush is about over. I do still love it for the things that it can do - hold tons of books - go into my purse - slim and light - get new books quickly anytime and anywhere over the wireless. But you have already heard all this.What I want to tell you about are some drawbacks. I have spent more money on books lately - and we know prices will most likely increase. Oh well, that's life. Another issue for me - a bibliophile - is I do sometimes miss the feel of a book - of being able to flip through pages looking for a particular passage - of sneaking ahead a few chapters and then going back. It's just not the same as holding a book.But my biggest complaint - are you listening Amazon? - is I can't share the wonderful book I just read with a friend! What a shame!"
3,Still love my Kindle 1,First let me say that I love my Kindle and do not know how I survived without one! Now for the bad news. I am a senior and have found that the type on the Kindle 2 is way too light. It also washes out in the sunlight which the Kindle 1 does not do. I also like to be able to replace my own battery so I do not have to go without my Kindle while it is being shipped to Amazon. I borrowed a friends Kindle 2 before buying it and am glad I did because as great as some of the upgrades are I am happy to stick with my Kindle 1 until Kindle 3. Hopefully the screen will be comparable to Kindle 1 if not I will keep waiting as long as my Kindle 1 survives.
1,How delightfully Orwellian,"Removing books you've purchased? I was intrigued by the Kindle, but in one swift move Amazon and their publishing partners have made me a believer in the paperback. Well, as long as they don't come into my house at night and take that back, too."
1,"Apparently, they can just reach in and delete your books.","I was reading the Complete Works of Orwell, and they reached in and DELETED the book over ""rights issues."" Thanks a lot, Kindle. It seems crazy to buy a book through this system if they can just delete it any time they want, and, in this case, you can't even buy it again.Apparently something similar happens with magazine subscriptions if you change devices - they are just gone forever."
1,"Bad move, Amazon.","I'm a Kindle 2 owner, I bough mine as soon as it came out last year and really love it from the start. My complaint is with Amazon policies regarding the Kindle, I'm really disappointed in Amazon for the bone headed decision to pull ebooks already paid for and loaded into the kindles without the owners consent, that is invasion of privacy last time I check. Shame on you Amazon."
5,My Kindle,"I couldn't be happier with my Kindle. I purchased it right after the new year and was delighted with the speed of it's delivery. I was able to load my first book on to it while it was still in transit so when it arrived, I was ready to read. I take it with me everywhere. I read as often as possible - waiting for my granddaughter at her gymnastics lessons, doctors or dentists offices and anywhere else I haven't got something to do. I choose often to read it at night instead of TV. I find it easy to use and have demonstrated it's capabilities to numerous people who have inquired. I've been approached at places like the airports while waiting for flights, in waiting rooms and by friends who are aware that I have it. I have 5 grown children and each of them is saving to buy their own because I won't lend mine. I also enjoy the selection of books available to me and the fact that I can order a book anywhere I am. I don't have to wait to read a sequel or a new book. I love my Kindle!"
4,21st century books,"It takes a little more getting used to so I can get around on the Kindle. Reading book works fine and I really appreciate tht I can make the print larger. Where I have some difficulty is picking books to buy. If I know what I want to get, no problem. But, if I want to browse it doesn't work as easily s I would like."
5,Best thing ever!,"Wow. I spent months and months researching this product and I have to admit that I was a bit scared about some of the reviews that I was reading. I, a full time college student, doesn't have 260 dollars to blow on just anything. But, I love to read and I purchased this item over a month ago. I LOVE IT! I use it almost every day. I take it to work with me and read on my lunch breaks. It has taken a new spot right next to my cell phone!!! I have had absolutly NO issues with my Kindle 2 and so far it has been the best purchase that i've made this year. I'm so happy that I bought it!"
5,Love it,"This is my second Kindle,The frist one was stolen..I ran ad offering a reward,but no one call me.I was really upset with myself,over being careless and losing it.KindlePC did easy the pain a little.Then for my birthday and Dad's Day,this year my kids and their spouses,went together and got me another one.I love it,use it everyday."
5,Great Product!,If you want a device for reading books so you dont have to lug have books around this is your device. Great screen for reading and very light weight for travel. I would recommend this product.
4,Kindle latest generation,"Bought this for my wife two months ago and she loves it. The only drawback for now is that you have to buy external light source, and on several occassions, some of the words disapear. Tech support said to reset it, but same issue happened again. She will give it another couple months and if this keeps happening, then she will send it in for service."
1,I would never buy this product because. . .,"Although the product is a GREAT idea, and it may be well executed, the fact that all your ""downloads"" or information can be deleted is too big of a risk. The fact that Amazon recently sent the delete command becasue of a product they ""offered"" was improperly secured is enough to turn me OFF on this product FOREVER.When I purchase a product, I expect to use that product. I expect to have some modicum of control over the product. I do not expect the seller to surreptitiously creep into my electronic devices and delete things. If you can delete your products, what is to stop a command from deletingall products, including those I did NOT secure from Amazon.What happens if the device goes belly up? Am I going to have to repurchase everything again? This would be like giving the RIAA control over your computer and ipod just to make sure that everything is ""legit.""Sorry, too many risks, to little benefit."
1,Even with price reduced to $299 is not worth it.,Imagine paying $300 for a device to download Amazon books which you pay. Not only that these books can be removed by Amazon anytime. You don't own it but it cost $300. Beside it is in monotone B/W. For the same price you can get a Net-book which offers full color and more...I still don't get why people are paying for these price inflated Amazon devices so you can pay more to buy books from them. Obviously these B/W technology below to the 60's. not this 21st Century!!!
1,Do not buy a Kindle!,"Don't buy a Kindle because they don't tell you everything when you order one. I bought one thinking it would be great. Well, I was so wrong. I'll tell you about some things that was wrong with mine. It would not turn off, it kept flipping from the page with the amazonkindle on it and flip back to the home page. This was continous. They said they had never heard of this before. Well, if you want my opinion, they knew all along. If I tried to turn it off, it came right back on.There is more I could say about it, but won't bore you any longer. Just don't buy it. They also will not give me a refund because it was exchanged. I will soon get my refund back even if I have to hire a lawyer to do so. I just think it would be cheaper to refund my money and make me a happy customer, but I don't think they want to make me a happy customer.I don't think they would waste their time trying to make me a happy customer. Therefore, I will NEVER buy anything from amazon again."
1,Awful Customer Service,"I can't believe I overpaid $70 for this thing and customer service wouldn't let me return it cause I missed the 30 day return window by 1 day. How they can afford to lose a lifelong customer over such a minor technicality is beyond me. If your expecting loyalty from Amazon in return from your business, don't hold your breath."
1,What else does it do?,"As a reading teacher, I was so excited to receive the Kindle for Mother's Day. My husband was excited because he was under the impression it had a light, so no more sleeping wih a book light or end table lamp. The Kandle light was $20.00 , the covers are outrageous-$34.00 and up.When I showed my middel and high school students, they were like,"" Well, what does it do?"" I couldn't find a book at their reading level with the audio feature. So basically, nothing! Half of the books published do not come in Kindle version. So, I bought books to read for next years curriculm. Tons of the books do not have the audio feature.If you upgrade your not far from the I-pad price. I found it to be a disappointment- it definitely is not for reading teachers!"
2,"Semi-cool, but definitely not worth the price","the fact that it has NO blacklight is reason enough NOT to get the kindle, especially when others have it. The other major draw back (at least if you want to use it for citing purposes), it has no page numbers so it makes it impossible to cite any references through the kindle. The only notable feature is that you can perform a word search on an entire text."
2,Disappointing discovery when it comes to its only purpose: Content,"I was in awe when I held it in my hands for the first time. I got it on the Hallowing day and showed to/told everyone I knew how incredible it is. Nevertheless once I starting loading it, the disappointments started. To begin with, I live in Brazil. And that's a big deal for Amazon. Some of the titles that I was looking for has a 'kind' note that reads: ""Due to copyright restrictions, certain Kindle Titles are not available to Latin America"". Does it mean that it maybe cracked or the device is not that secure to hold a book, let say, Brazil? I pass the question to AMAZON, because to me it does not make sense that only some titles are available (electronically) to certain countries. If some authors can make such restrictions, so they shouldn't be available in any other format."
5,My Kindle,"The Kindle is a fantastic reading experience, no pages in the wind, don't have to carry multiple books at one time, and able to enlarge the print to help with older eyes. Document compatability is a great Plus.MylesKurdistan, Iraq"
5,Almost like the real thing!,"I fell in love with my Kindle2 immediately. I read the entire Twilight series in three weeks. I knew I was hooked when I put my index finger to the top corner of the Kindle to ""turn the page"". I love it. Just wish I had waited for the DX."
5,My best buddy,I got my kindle 2 for an early Christmas present. I read it every day and into the night. How I ever went without one for this long is beyond me. I am not a winter person so I do a lot of reading. I love not having to run to the store to buy a new book. It saves time and money. I absolutely love it.
5,Book Readers Dream,"My son had the original kindle and loved it. I read several books a month and didn't know if the cost was worth it. Well, it was. Even though some of my favorite authors are not available on the Kindle and some of the kindle books are the same price that I can buy the book at a discount warehouse, it's the convenience. I also like the sample book feature. I would have purchased these books but after reading the sample I determined I couldn't get into them. Money saved!!! I recommend that you buy the kindle cover it makes it seem more like a book and a book light. I also purchased the extended warranty just to be on the safe side. If you're on the fence just go for it you won't be disappointed."
5,Kindle's Kindness,"I love my Kindle! It was so easy to load books & to use!BrendaKindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, U.S. Wireless)"
4,Ecstatic with Reservations,I had the first Kindle for almost a year and was very pleased except for a couple of things. Page turning was too easy and deleting was rather difficult. Not so with Kindle 2. I find it greatly improved over the first Kindle. But I was astounded when I found out I couldn't purchase and replace the battery myself. When I discovered that I would have to send in my Kindle 2 for a battery replacement you can understand the panic and disappointment that I felt. (This being the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5.) Thank goodness that I decided to keep my first Kindle as backup for such instances. I am totally spoiled and can barely stand to read a regular book now (the type size is never adequate in a regular book). I live in a rural area without the advantage of using the WhisperNet. I must travel at least 10 miles to get reception. I really wish that I could download samples to my computer. That would supply all the reading needs that I require.
5,Love the Kindle2,"Great product. Brilliant delivery system (whispersync). I read more than I did before because it's easy to get books. I love that I can get new releases (NYT Best Sellers) for 9.99 instead of $15-$30 for the hard cover books. I can have multiple books going at once.Cons: Keyboard - don't need it often, why would it need to take up so much space? I'd rather have bigger screen; I wish it was waterproof...beach or poolside reading is a potentially dangerous situation."
4,I love my Kindle!!!!!,"I love my Kindle!!!! I'm a book junkie & have gotten used to buying books, but this is a great invention!!!!!"
5,fantastic,"I love my kindle. I read all the time.I love the fact that I can order a book and in seconds it's on my kindle,ready to read."
5,Kindle 2,"Due to a mishap with my Kindle 1 (which I loved dearly), I purchased the Kindle 2.Before I made up my mind, I decided to check out the competition. After viewing the iPad, I found it too big and heavy. Then I checked out the Nook. I didn't like the feel of the cover or the way in which you have to maneuver around the touch pad. It was too cumbersome.I learned basically what I knew from the beginning: that the Kindle is just right for me."
2,Kindle is available FREE on the iPhone,"I was given a Kindle 2 for Christmas and thought it looked great. But, the first thing I did was load Kindle onto my iPhone, so I could sync my two devices. Once I had downloaded my first book I realised that there were practically no occasions where I would rather be reading my Kindle than my iPhone! The iPhone is far more portable for everyday use, but most importantly has a backlight so I can read wherever I am regardless of the lighting around me. Vital when my other half is asleep and I can't have the light on without waking him up! If the Kindle had cost much less, then it may have stayed with me as an alternative to the iPhone when in ideal conditions, but unfortunately it was way too expensive for that so it was sent back. Kindle on the iPhone is fab!"
3,No Security,"Take care: these are stolen all the time and surprisingly there is NO WAY to track them. Amazon knows, of course, when the device is dergistered and re-registered but they DO NOT email the owner of such a change nor do they make that information available to the owner or the police when it happens, so theives get away scott free (and know it).I purchased a Kindle for my grandson for Christmas and had it snatched from my car. I called the police in Boston and Amazon quickly - the police said let us know who registers it and Amazon said we don't do that. Other readers at least email you when you are the registered owner and someone tries to re-register it. I suggest buying something else or, at least, having your name and address inscribed in the device in an indelible way."
3,A few points to improve,The page number of the book is not shown on Kindle. I hope that can be improved. Many of the titles do not have a Kindle version; I hope the authors or publishers should be persuaded to join the Kindle platform so we can all help to save a few trees of this world.
2,A lot of money for a short life,"My kindle was a gift two years ago. An avid reader, I was skeptical, but soon converted and loved, loved, loved my kindle. I waxed romantically whenever I spoke of it. I know at least five people who purchased a kindle after talking with me about how much I loved it. Well, almost two years later, it started to get scratchy lines and now I cannot read the text. Amazon will sell me a refurbished original for $99, but no discount on Kindle 2 or the DX. . . . I think hardware should last longer than just about two years, especially given the cost. Since it is a fault of their design and product, I think they should reward customers who willingly tried the first edition (especially when it cost so much) and at least provide a discount on the new technology. I am disappointed and going to investigate other readers and things like the iTouch. . . maybe they will not break so quickly."
5,"I still love paper books, but I love trees and writers more","I am loving the new Kindle. It reads like a paperback, but one with adjustable font size. The weight is easy enough to handle in one hand. Page flipping is easier than with a book. The instant dictionary feature is perfect. I read three books (with illustrations) in the first week and a half. I like owning books, being able to revisit them later if I like them. But I can't store all I read and I'm personally responsible for the deaths of trees for my paper consumption. So I want a greener alternative. ""Use the library"" they say, but the authors don't get paid every time you check out a book and I burn a gallon of gas from my house to the library and back."
5,"Yes, Please","The Kindle is one of the most convient revolutions to the written word. It puts an entire library in your purse, bookbag, suitcase, briefcase, etc. The convience of the Kindle is like no other ereader available. Amazon brings you global wireless to purchase a book at your convience anywhere. Other readers force you to find a wi-fi hotspot or download online but the Kindle connects to the best supplier of books available-Amazon.com. With countless books available at a lower cost, it's worth it already. But not only can you read books but you can have them read to you, adjust the font size to your eyes, define words at the touch of a button, add notes, and bookmark and highlight sections. It's a great tool for any college student and a fantastic toy for every person that loves to read."
5,I LOVE my Kindle!!!!,"I love my kindle! I first was introduced to it by my roommate who got one. At first I did not like the concept. I loved the feeling of the book, turning the pages ect ect. However, when she let me borrow her kindle to read Breaking Dawn, I feel in love with it. The ability to change the font size is one of the features I love best, as it is very difficult for me to read the smaller print books, also the fact that I can be anywhere(car,house,work) and be able to download a book. Which is great when you are reading a series and can't wait to start the next book. The weight and slim design allows me to take my kindle where ever I go, it fits perfectly into my purse.I never leave home without it. It is so easy just to pull it out and read while you are in line waiting at a store and things like that. The kindle was the best purchase I have ever made. I totally recommend one to anyone who is an avid reader. I have no complaints about it."
5,amazon warehouse!,"i got this kindle for half of what i would have had to pay for a 3g kindle with 3g connection. i didnt even know amazon warehouse existed! its a little tricky to find but you get great product for a low price. amazon really stands behind their product and service. i am a very loyal customer and now so is my fiance, she loves the e-reader more than me now!"
4,Kindle 2 gift,"I received a Kindle 2 a couple of years ago for my birthday from my family. I had been downloading books to my PDA which was very satisfactory, and, it was back lit. Although I purchased a light for reading in the dark, I miss that back lit feature. After almost a year after my actual birthday I noticed a crack in the case and the functions were not operating as they should. I was in touch with Amazon and although it was technically out of warranty, they replaced it at no charge. This 2nd one has been working fine. Only one issue: I charged it overnight a few days ago using the USB cable and wall charger adapter and when I went to unplug it the next morning the plastic insulation on the cable was brittle and flaking off. There was actually bare wire exposed at many locations along the cable. I've ordered a new aftermarket one (they're not very expensive) and I hope that one will last longer than the original."
5,Excellent reader. I think the best available.,"I bought this reader after my Sony reader broke. I wanted to get a Kindle, but couldn't justify it. I love the ability to get books either via wireless or Amazon. The onboard features (Google, Wikipedia, etc) are what really make this exceptional.I find I'm reading more and there is virtually no eye strain!I LOVE MY KINDLE.I'm looking forward to more books becoming available."
2,pdf file support lacking,"I finally purchased a kindle when they added native pdf support to the 6 inch version. Unfortunately the kindle, while it CAN display pdf files, DOES NOT allow adjustment of the font size on the device. The display of pdf ebooks on the kindle is so small it's unreadable.If you plan to purchase your ebooks solely from amazon, it's a great device. If you already own a bunch of ebooks in pdf format, the Kindle (at least the 6 inch version) is useless.too bad."
3,Kindle in Canada,"I bought the 2nd generation 6"" screen Kindle and am satisfied with its readability. Title selections are limited as many new books have copyright protection that prohibits purchase by international customers. had I known this in advance I would not have purchased it. Even screen protectors can't be shipped here due to warranty issues. I also find the highlighting tool limited in utility."
2,Kindle Wireless,"The product seems to be good. We live in an area where the AT&T; wireless service is inadequate. We had to drive 25 miles to get to an AT&T; wireless service area.Before purchase, be sure you are in an AT&T; wireless service area."
3,Kindle 2nd generation,"I was so excited to finally get a Kindle...however, the day after I unpacked it from its wrapping and recycled the packing material ..literally one day mind you...the NEW Kindle was announced with 50% better definition and smaller too! I tried to return it for the new model ...but alas, without the original packing stuff I was unable to do that.that being said I do enjoy using it and will take it with me on trips for sure....but geez...one day? really? talk about bad timing.sort of puts a bad taste in your mouth:("
2,Poor assistance from Amazon,"I bought this item 1 week prior to the release of the new improved version (that came with the same price), Amazon didn't mention the upcoming release.It's a shame Amazon sells obsolete things for the same price with no warning"
3,Needs page numbers!,The kindle is great but I'd like to be able to buy more books for school on my kindle. I can't do this because I can't site my sources properly. Please add the proper page numbers to the kindle!!
2,CHECK. THE. COVERAGE. MAP.,"""Global"" isn't GLOBAL. I live in southern MN and it was my mistake to not check the maps before buying. Southern MN does not get service...anywhere...even the places the map says it gets coverage. I will be returning the Kindle and buying a Barns and Noble Nook but not before checking the coverage map. So if you live in a small rural area, think twice about buying the Amazon Kindle!!"
5,LOVE MY KINDLE,"I received my kindle for a Christmas gift. Prior to having it, I thought I really would enjoy it but worried about it just being another electronic gadget. I found that to be the farthest thing from the truth. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. So convenient and handy to take with you. Easy to navigate. Since getting mine, I have purchased 2 more for gifts. I would highly recommend a kindle."
5,Love the Kindle,"I recently bought a Kindle. For anyone that loves to read this is the way to go. The money you will save buying books will pay for the Kindle and the books are at your finger tips. It's light weight, very easy to hold, unlike some books. Since i got mine, three of my friends have bought a Kindle and they also love it. Can't go wrong with a Kindle."
5,International Travel.....,"I was saved by the Kindle! We were flying to Europe for our daughter's wedding & I was wondering what to bring....not clothes, but books! How could I possibly bring enough books for the long flights as well as those down times that might occur? I am a commiteed book addict you see. Problem solved when my husband & another daughter gave me a Kindle...how cool! I downloaded 6 books for the trip & actually read about 4 of them while away. While at the pool at our hotel on Corfu, I had people stop to see this wonderous device....& I haven't stopped talking about it since. I thought I would just put it away when I returned home, but when I've read all my books from the library, back I go to my Kindle. I think you can tell I love this device & thank those who invented it!"
5,Great Gift,Bought this for my wife as a Birthday gift and I am now certain diamonds are no longer a girls best friend.
2,"Kindle is a good device, but content needs work","Kindle 2 (6"") is a good device. The interface is smooth, the device is light, but it has no backlighting: this should have been a feature. I understand that this would mean some loss on battery life, but nevertheless - it would be a small addition to make this a user controled function.The content, outside the NYT Bestsellers Lists, is either non-existant, or outrageously over-priced. I've seen Digital books at $100.00 or more.That is silly.Until Amazon decide to make more content available at a reasonable price, I think I'll be returning mine."
3,Fantastic but too much wasted space,"I write this review wishing I could be more positive as the technology is simply fantastic, however, where the kindle has failed for me is that there is far too much technology or should I say wasted space around the main screen and an unnecessary clutter. When you pick up a book you don't have a thick boarder around it, a keyboard and buttons. I felt the screen should be larger and the keyboard should be hidden or retractable. There should be a very slim boarder so you are immersed in the content on the page not felt you are holding a computer gadget.Its disappointing and this could have been so much more particularly as the page technology is simply fantastic. Maybe the 3rd generation will get it right or maybe if Mac bring out a version it will hit the spot but for me, enlarge the screen, lose the wasted space and technology surrounding the page."
2,Kindle,"I thought this would be a great Christmas present. What they don't tell you is that the wireless system is AT&T which is great if you live in or near areas serviced by them. Unfortunately they don't service rural areas here in Southern Oregon where I reside, (we have to use US Cellular for cell phone service), so the unit can't be used at home which is where it was intended to be used. Customer service was appologetic, and said some time in the future services may be expanded (couldn't say when). So I either have to drive to an area where I can get reception, or return the unit & pay shipping back. If it was disclosed that AT&T was the service carrier, I would have known not to order it and save the $25. shipping for both ways. They need to do a better job of disclosure. For those of you that are lucky enough to have service, I am sure it is a wonderful item & you should enjoy."
2,The Problems With Kindle,"I bought my kindle because I was going on vacation in Europe, ""I also thought it would be fun to have one"", but my kindle broke three days into my vacation. It just stopped working. I'm fine with that because kindle feels nothing like reading a real book. + A LOT OF BOOKS STILL ARENT ON KINDLE LIKE TWILIGHT AND 39 CLUES AND SKELETON CREEK!!!"
4,Kindle and a Kindle Bag,"The Kindle is becoming a great friend of mine and I have enjoyed the transportability so much. I was looking for a cool bag to carry it in and googled Kindle Bags and found the cutest bags. Look for an Italian name, starting with a ""B."" If you have a Kindle and want to keep it protected, you should look them up. Love my Kindle!!!"
4,"Great, but you can't share books","The look and feel of the device is very good. Of course, epaper doesn't have the contrast and resolution of real paper, but the conveniences of small size, excellent ergonomics, and quick order of new books more than make up for this. It's easy to get used to the format and it's great to have books ""bookmarked"" across multiple devices including iphone and ipod touch. The selection is good, but could be better.The big problem is the inability to share a book you have finished. The price of the book is significantly discounted for new books, but not for books out in paperback. Considering the negligible cost of distribution, Amazon is making a killing on older books and still doesn't let you share them. If you can't share a book, you don't really own it."
3,Good but no Cigar,"Its a good gadget, the screen is to small for scientific books, but good enough for normal reading.The main problem is; that residing in Europe there is a lot of books which I do not have access to. Some of it I can understand, New books, not yet released in Europe, but that I am not allowed to buy Arthur Rimbaud - A Season in Hell and The Illuminations I do not get ?"
5,Great Instrument But Missing a Needed Feature,"I bought a Kindle for my wife and she love's it. We just took it with us on a 3 week trip to Thailand, Viet Nam and Cambodia. She read 3 books on the trip.Her only complaint and that of others: No way to read the Kindle at night without an external light source illuminating it. Kindle needs a built in light source to enable night reading without exterior lighting.Again, what a great device!"
2,"Great Hardware, Lacking content","The kindle hardware is excellent. The screen is easy on the eyes. My problem is that now that I have it and I go to get a book I want, I come to realize that the title is not available for the kindle. It happens frequently. Amazon is good about having new titles for the kindle, but older books might not be available. Check before you buy. Also I have purchased a few books now and most of them have been poorly formatted. They are missing a table of contents, chapter titles are inline with the text. I suppose that that issue is one with the publisher and not amazon, but the shoddy formatting can take me out of my reading."
4,Convenience!,"I admit that I have not read as much as I should the last few years. A friend's wife showed us her Kindle, and I bought a Kindle 2 for my wife. Well, guess who has been using it? I haven't read this much in a long time. It is amazingly convenient to just push a button and read the book. It is a revelation, almost like my first time in a library.I do have some suggestions:1) It would be nice if you could brighten the screen, so that you did not have to turn a light on behind you to read in the dark.2) Maps are very difficult to read, and I have not seen any photographs on it yet. This is a bummer for reading military books.3) I find it burdensome to use the Kindle book store to find great books. I know they are there, but I have not figured out how to screen for the ones I want.I bought the Kindle leather cover, and like that, too.All in all, a revolutionary product, like the GPS mapper in my car."
4,Satisfied,"The Kindle is great for reading books. In fact, I'd say it's easier to read a novel with the Kindle than to real a real book. If you plan to read reference materials where you have to flip back and forth often, it's more of a pain but it can be done using notes and bookmarks. The web browsing functionality isn't worth using at all. The Kindle is definitely not a substitute for a laptop, but, as I've said, it is very good for reading books and it's the only way that I read books now. It's so small and convenient, I don't have the same tolerance for carrying normal books anymore!"
1,Kindle done after 19 months,"I haven't turned on my Kindle for a few weeks, was about to purchase a new book and the screen is completely crapped out. It has lines, and a partial screen saver of ""love to hear about your Kindle Experience"" and i can't even read the url to provide my disappointment . I can't believe with such moderate use, that I only got 19 months out of it. I was raving about it when i first got it, but now I will have to take it all back. I paid $139 for it and didn't even last 2 years."
1,only lasts 2 years,Worked great with moderate usage for 2 years. After that black lines on screen. No more Kindle. Enjoy it while it lasts
4,KINDEL 2,"I LIKE THE KINDEL, IT IS EASY TO NAVIGATE AND TO READ. IS THERE A SKIN THAT CAN BE PUT OVER IT, LIKE ON A BLACKBERRY TO MAKE IT EASIER TO HOLD? I WAS DISAPPOINTED IT THE QUALITY OF THE VOICE ACTIVATED PART FOR 3 REASONS: 1. COULDN'T GET VOLUME HIGH ENOUGH. 2.COMPUTER MISPRONOUNCED NAMES AND WORDS, AND 3. THE VOICE DOESN'T PAUSE FOR PERIODS OR COMMAS AND IT MAKES IT HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE COMPLETE THOUGHT IS. CAN THEY IMPROVE THE VOICE ACTIVATION?MIRIAM BAKER"
4,Walk in the Park,"The kindle 2 is absolutely wonderful. We should have two, since we both are avid readers (something to think about).The kindle is like bringing your child or dog to the park. The remarks are always: Isn't that nice!; How long have you had it?; It is so ""cute;""I'm thinking seriously of owning one, etc.The kindle has been so much better than carrying a number of books with us, as we always did prior to owning one.The technology and ease of operation is great!We've also had occasion to contact your techical service people whom we have found to be extremely courteous and quite knowledgeable.Best of luck with future products."
2,KINDLE WOULD NOT DOWNLOAD THE NY TIMES,YOUR CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVE LEAD ME TO BELIEVE THAT MY KINDLE WAS NOT WORKING AND THAT IS WHY A NEW ONE WAS ORDERED. AFTER RECEIVING THE NEW ONE I WAS SSTILL HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. YOUR CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVE INDICATED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS IN NOST RECEIVING A STRONG ENOUGH SIGNAL IN MY HOUSE WHICH WAS CAUSINSG MY KINDLE NOT TO DOWNLOAD STHE NY TIMES. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE WAS CORRECT THIS TIME AND I NOW KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THE PROBLEM.YOUR OTHER CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVE CAUSED YOU TO SEND ME A NEW ONE AND FOR ME TO PAY SHIPPING FOR SOMETHING I DID NOT NEED.
1,Bad unit received and can not exchange when applying return,"I bought this kindle as a v'day gift for my husband. It was delivered on time but it's a bad unit. The unit can not be powered on and the screen just showed some blackout areas. I applied exchange online and I did see the options of getting refund or getting replacement. I chose replacement and sent the bad unit back. However, I didn't get any shipment information about the replacement and then I called the customer service, they told me it's impossible to apply exchange online, and I had to call them to make it. That's totally unacceptable. Never mind, I will just get the refund and turn to Barnes&Noble's nook."
1,Bought it for my wife and she hates it,Bought it for her for Christmas and she really hates it. Her eyes are poor and she was hoping for something that was backlit. The black text on a gray background just doesn't work for her. It didn't even make it through Christmas day.
4,Kindle for Travel,I purchased the Kindle to use for ease of travel. With today's restriction on luggage carrying books is impossible. The Kindle works great. It is light weight and easy to read and I have access to books anywhere.
4,Disappointed,"I have found the usage features of the Kindle fine, but the battery life is deficient. I am only getting 3 hours life instead of 7 days. It has never charged up to a green light. I started travelling in Vietnam straight after purchase and am having trouble trying to do the fixes that Amazon suggest, but I do not expect to have a problem like this on a brand new productLindsay Tennyson"
3,The Screen...,"This review is solely about the Kindle screen. Here are my problems with the screen:1. Not bright enough. On average the Kindle is about 2 times darker than your average book page.A lot more if the paper happens to be white. Kindle screen is a light gray and because of thisthe contrast is low. Even with a reading light, its still dark for me.2. Low resolution. The Kindle resolution is 600x800. Just not sharp enough to compare with printedmaterial which has a resolution greater than 300x300 per inch. The need to at least double theresolution of the kindle.If they could double the resolution, use a lighter gray, and make the device black (this helps)it would probably be ok then.On the plus side, its pretty easy on the eye, so you can read for a long time without straining youreyes too much.Then there are the weird stuff. No Zoom! You cannot zoom into a photo or diagram in a book or PDF."
4,Kindle,"It's nice. I tried to wait as long as I could, for the latest version/features, but lo and behold. Got it about 2 weeks before the international service came out. Oh well. I am active duty Army and go overseas frequently, so it would have been nice.Maybe the international service part can be bought as an upgrade for the $20 difference.Curious why there is not backlight, even one that you can turn off and on. I like to read in bed and my husband refuses to have the light on, maybe the problem lies in my husband and not the Kindle. Ha ha."
4,Happy with my Kindle2,"This is my first ebook reader, and I was somewhat skeptical prior to getting my Kindle2, but I am very happy with it!It's very intuitive, so I am comfortable with the basics, but I may need to actually read the instructions to find out if there is a quick way to get back to my last page read if I don't set a bookmark. A couple of observations:1. I find that my right thumb cramps sometimes due to the position of the ""next page"" button - when I am holding my Kindle my thumb naturally lies over the bottom edge of the screen a little bit, so it would help if the button were a little wider to more closely accommodate that position.2. I would like to see a shift key on the right hand side of the keyboard as well as the left - trying to capitalize a letter on the left side of the keyboard is very awkward.I would love to know what constitues a ""location"" - is it a paragraph?"
4,kindle II,"Takes some getting used to. In general I like it, but it's no way to read a newspaper--at least for me. Can't imagine the new version would be that much better."
4,page turn,"great device!!only one comment... it would be easier to hold if the page turner buttons were higher up, about an inch."
4,Good and bad,"Don't get me wrong, I like my kindle. No more books to get rid of laying all over the house. No more trips to the book store to find a book to read. All of that is great. Here is what I don't like!I can't share the good books I read with my friends unless I let them use my kindle to read them and thats not going to happen. Is this the beginning of the end of the used book store? Will paperbacks go the same route as the newspapers, out of business? Has Amazon found a way to increase sales by eliminating the paperback book with this device? Has Amazon thought about this during the development of this product? You bet they have, its one of the objectives that drive the future developement of the device. Think about it."
5,All I could have hoped and waited for . . .,"I got my new Kindle a few weeks ago and have become very attached to it. I bought it primarily to get and read my newspapers during my commute, and it has worked out extremey well for me. All news waiting for me when I get up at the right price. Easy to read except for the most low light environments, and super easy to navigate around a newspaper or magazine. No scrolling from one of end the paper to the other to get to the stories of interest. Just jump to the paper section from the directory and then toggle from one story to the next, or page up and down for continuous reading.Also receives Word and pdf files (pdf still hit or miss but experimental - hoping for fimrware update on that soon), which is nice for bringing work reading home without printing and humping 200 pages of paper along. Hell, I might even buy some books on it for when I travel.Great product!"
5,What Can I Say?,"What can I say that has not already been said by the thousands of other people whom have written reviews for the Kindle 2?It is simply a must have, this is a device that I actually find as useful and portable as my blackberry. I could not be happier - I am even looking forward to the release of the kindle 3 - what will they do next?"
4,Beginning User of the Kindle 2,The experience has been very positive for me. I am not a computer wizard and yet have found the ability to do all necessary to enjoy the reading.
4,kindle,this kindle is fine. 2nd one I purchased. BUt now I see a new one is going to be available for $50 less with new features. Wish I had known and wish I had waited
2,"Love the device, hate the service","Love the device itself, easy to use, clear screen and synching with the PC and online at amozon.com is great. Being able to download books almost anywhere is brilliant (and a major factor in my buying decision), what a shame more books aren't available.Hate the service. I have to pay in US dollars and effectively purchasse items from the US yet I have to pay more than US residents. The library of books is miniscule compared with the likes of Waterstone's in the UK. Books available to US residents are not available to me allegedly because of copyright reasons. Yet I can buy the same ebooks from other retailers in the UK. The Kindle app for the iPod is not available on the UK Apple Store. Access to the web is restricted, I can't even use Google.This is not an International Edition, it's an updated edition for US residents travelling abroad. I feel misled and very let down. Amazon should get this sorted very soon."
4,"Good, but time for a software update.","1) First impression is that the biggest drawback is the inability to organize books into folders by Genre, Author, etc to make finding the book you want easier. It can hold over a thousand books, but all appear in the top menu and you would have to flip through 100 pages of titles to find what you want. So only practical to store a few titles at a time on it.2) Next major drawback.........please, please add native PDF file support.Overall....the user interface is really primitive and desperately needs an update - hopefully through software or firmware update only."
3,A little hard getting used to.,"After spending my whole life reading printed books, this one was a little hard getting used to. There are some things that you'll need to learn to give up in order to enjoy a Kindle. However, it is the way of the future and is the most economical and ecological solution to books. Go Amazon!"
5,a new show,"The item was fed ex promptly and showed no wear , would do it again! has never failed so far ?"
1,No ties for me,I returned it upon discovering that I was being tied down to Amazon and having to ONLY buy/read certain types of e-books.
3,Not worth the price,Been looking at the different readers available. Son convinced us this was the one to buy. The kindle itself would be very nice if the background was white instead of a shade of gray. Makes reading from it more difficult. Wish we would have waited for the new one coming out. Looks to have a much brighter background.Not worth the price. Can get hard covered books much cheaper then they are offered at Amazon.
3,"Okay, but not for me yet.","The Kindle arrived and it was nice but I returned it. My only problem is that many of the books I wanted weren't available yet for Kindle. The 6"" screen finally was just too small, but I'm not about to pay for the DX. Buttons were cheap and plasticky and the next page buttons seemed to creak a lot.I did expect books to be cheaper as well. They are cheaper than the list price, but rarely much cheaper than how much you could get them from Amazon in hardcopy.It is neat and if money is just to burn it is a great toy, but until pricing is more competitive I think I'll try my local library and not spend a cent."
2,tricky amazon,"I don't know if the Wireless Kindle unit worked fine or not ,for it got send to us. We had to pay for it without knowing that we ordered it. So we[[ASIN:B0015TCML0 Kindle DX Wireless Reading Device (9.7"" Display, U.S. Wireless)] send it back unopened. We are waiting for the money being refunded yet. We never had this problem with DVDs from the same site."
3,ok but over priced,"its ok i dont like amazon on the web site as i mistake and its yours put on your c c card, takes a phone call to Amecaria to cancal the order, three days a go i bought a book i did not want too late its mine. Amazon need a check out where you have to confurm your order ,thats why i have switch off wireless part from that its ok"
3,excited then a big disappointment,"i bought kindle 2 and was so excited to be able to read any book i want at anytime, but it only lasted for two weeks before its screen got black strips at the menu scroll part making it difficult to make a choice of what i want to do. i got so annoyed. i send it back and still waiting to hear from kindle. i also troubleshoot online and discovered that it is a common problem. hopefully they will refund me or replace it. it is so useful though. i am just wondering why kindle are unable to deal with that problem? anyway, good luck if you decide to buy one. i still recommend it over ipad."
2,Poor selection of books for Canada,"I bought a Kindle DX. The device performs well enough, screen refresh could be better. But the biggest problem is the poor selection of books for Canadian readers. A lot of books aren't available to Canadian Kindle users. For example a lot of John Updike and Yukio Mishima novels are not for sale to Canadian customers, only Americans. And since this device doessn't support epub. I can't buy the books from other sellers.Not recomended for Canadian readers."
4,Kindle Time,"I have had my Kindle for about a month. I am very impressed with the speed of downloads, the selection of avail. books, and all the features of the Kindle. I really enjoy be able to put music on my Kindle to read by."
3,Kindle 2: very impressive but not for everybody,"I liked the different features of the Kindle. Especially the ability to buy books, etc. fast and easy. I do not like hard-bound books, though, and I found the Kindle too stiff. I like books that are easy to flex. I found the interface quite good but it needs some additional work. Reading a newspaper or a magazine proved inefficient on a small, black and white only, scree.I do salute Amazon's innovation and do not doubt that future generations will improve."
5,The Best Thing Ever!,"The Kindle is the best purchase i've made in a long time! I LOVE it!! It's very user friendly and very simple to use! It's so lightweight I carry around in my purse wherever I go. I've been able to read much more now that I can take hundreds of books with me wherever I am. I bought my kindle before I flew over seas to Australia and it was a life saver on the plane! I finished three books just on the way there! I never would of brought that many books with me if I would of had to pack the actual books around with me. If you love to read, this is the thing for you!"
2,Third one to die,"I have to say, that I am very happy with the product....when it works, however I just went on a trip and for the third time...when I went to fire up my Kindle it was dead. Now it is the original Kindle 1 so maybe they have gotten better but it is pretty disappointing when you get on a three hour flight and find that you don't have a book to read."
3,Kindle 2,"The powercord is defective in that without external support to power up the power up the unit. Wish engineers would look to the Apple Notebook power cord for the right solution to defective powering mechanisms for electronic devices. Roy Hanson, Long Beach, California,"
1,Keep Looking...,"Froze within 3 days of purchase. They offered to ""fix"" it of course, but how reliable is a ""fixed"" reader that was only 3 days old???Why don't you make one without issues to begin with?Get a Nook!"
3,Depends,"You have to get used to the features on this model. It takes time to get your mind used to reading off of a computer screen, rather than the feel of pages that we are so used to. But I think this is the next generation of readers....I imagine the future will show the fading away of using paper for books...seems ecologically sound and smart...but this needs a bit of work."
3,there should a prepaid amazon book purchase card to enhace the kindle,I gave the kindle to my grandson but was very disappointed that there was no way to also give him the means to purchase books through kindle. You should offer a prepaid credit card that is reloadable from Amazon.
5,LOVE MY KINDLE 2,WONDERFUL. JUST LIKE READING A BOOK. PERFECT FOR COMMUTERS LIKE MYSELF MUCH EASIER THAN HAULING A BOOK WITH ME EVERYWHERE. PLUS YOU NEVER RUN OUT OF READING MATERIAL. IF I FINISH THE BOOK I'M READING I JUST DOWNLOAD A NEW ONE.
5,changes,only changes i would make are: (1) put the a/c recharger port on the top or right side that it would still be comfortable to hold with the cord plugged in; and (2) the page forward bottons should be higher so that they are not inadvertently hit causing the page to go forward when holding to read.
5,No more wasted paper.,"I am sorry to say I recently tried to give all our families hardback books to a local bookstore, they would not take them. I thought that once our family finished reading them, wouldn't it be nice to have someone else read these perfect used books for less money. The bookstore would not take them for free and resell. They told us that people by the paperbacks now and would not buy the hardbacks. Well from this point on, our family vows never to buy a book in print. It amazed us what a waste it has been to purchase these books in print. We will be donating to a local nursing home and hospital. Look forward to many years of kindle use. Thanks Amazon."
3,Frustrated Brazilian User. No Wireless.,"I just bought the Kindle 2 (US & International) and received yesterday. My expectations were high. The problem is that wireless is not working when it was supposed to be working. I live in Curitiba, Brazil, and based on the coverage area for Brazil, I should be getting 3G coverage. So far I can transfer my books only using the USB cable. Could be some issue between Amazon and the mobile operators in Brazil? Go figure.The Kindle itself is great.Joster"
4,Made a great gft!,"Opened on Christmas morning and was pleased as can be. Charged the battery and downloaded the first book in no time!Only little item is that it was purchased as a gift, and even when registered with the new owner, it still ""welcomes"" my name. I guess they will always know who gave them their Kindle!"
3,kindle 2,"it is small and very managable. the device it self is very well made. the one and very big draw back is that not all contemorary authors are included in the library for this reader. and when asked, amazon tell you to write to the author or publishing company. i feel if they want to sell this product its up to them to get books. an example of a missing author is grisham...you won't find any of his books for kindle."
1,This Product Uses DRM and Some Users Have Had Legitimate Content Deleted,"This product comes with DRM (Digital Rights Management) Technology which means you do not necessarily have control of the content you purchase for this device. For example, recently hundreds of owners of this product found their purchased copies of George Orwell's 1984 deleted from the device. Google for the full story that appeared in the New York Times."
1,"Didn't work in my area,Maine",I had to return the Kindle because there was no connection in my areaSORRY I should have called and asked about that first. My mistake!I will always call first for things like that.
4,Amazing Device!,The Kindle 2 is honestly a great device. It's new slim design and keyboard make carrying it and using it a breeze. The menus are easy to navigate and all the functions you can perform on any piece of reading material are helpful. The only gripe I would have to say I have with the Kindle 2 is it's catalog selection. As an avid reader I enjoy being able to experience a variety of literature types. With the Kindle 2 it seems that they focus on mainly what are bestsellers or mainstream. Once the Kindle acquires a larger reading selection I would say it has truly reached perfection.
4,MY KINDLE,I recently purchased a Kindle after checking out various reviews. I have MS which has affected my eyesight. The fact that it is easy to handle and the font can be changed has made it possible for me to read again .You have no idea how much this has meant. Thank you!
4,MAKE SENIOR LIVING MORE PLEASURABLE,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my Kindle especially being able toset print size on any book. Book selection is good & pricereasonable - weight better than book. I.Baker, Marietta, GA"
5,just love the KIndle,"Well I have wonted one of these for years & my daughter got me one for Xmas 2009 well I am hooked run out of space at home for more books now on this little divice I can now have 1500 books ""wow"" is all I can say I have had three friends get one as well, the one complaint I have is not all books from Amazon are for sale to Australia, and its rather frustrating to read an Author who has many books out in a series but not all available in Australia no one seems to be able to explain that issue to me other than to say its an copy write issue, but if some of her books are out on kindle for Australia why not all of them. Otherwise I love the kindle as specially when traveling not having to carry heavy books or leave behind when bags to heavy to bring home due to weight restrictions .."
1,VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER!,"I feel very betrayed. I have waited to buy a kindle 2 for some time now. I purchased one and in less than 2wks. it slid off the 1 1/2ft. tall stool. I can no longer see the top part of my screen. I watched the ""drop test"" before purchasing, which leads you to believe that it's durable enough to withstand a 30"" fall and still work. Not the case.I called customer support and was shocked to find out that you can't have it repaired. You send your broken one in and they sell you a refurbished one for $200! To top it off the team leader was not very friendly. We ended the conversation with him telling me he would call me back to tell me when I would be hearing from someone in a different department. That was 3 days ago.I had no idea customer support would be so bad with a company that I thought was so good. Still waiting to hear from someone to get the problem resolved. Wish me luck."
5,Show Macmillan who's boss,Macmillan Publishing negotiated higher prices for its books on the Kindle. You will now pay up to 15 bucks for an electronic copy of a book. Give me a break - while everyone else is getting hit in a bad economy these guys shoehorned a 50% price hike to Kindle owners.Show Macmillan they don't have pricing power by avoiding their products on the Kindle.
3,Company should make right!,I purchased this device in late October 2008 after watching a big promotional show on the Ophra show. Four months later they come out with a second model??? I was very upset when I found this out and call Amazon for an upgrade or replacement. I was told that there are no upgrades and if I wanted the newer model to sell my old one on there website - which was only four months old on Amazon and then buy the new one???? For an expensive item such as this you would think the manufacture would appreciate its customers and provide them with the updated model.
1,Returned due to high book prices,"Amazon has started pricing new books close to hardcover price levels, but one cannot pass the Kindle version on to others or resell it. I returned my new Kindle II when I discovered this. High cost device, but exposes one to predatory pricing by Amazon at any time, especially as installed base increases."
2,"Not quite, there yet...","Close, but ... When this device shows color, and can run PIM applications, let me know and I will buy one. Many of the books and magazines I read contain color photos."
5,Everything it said it would be and more,"The Kindle is everything it said it would be. Unexpected upsides - the ability to email word or PDF files, and the number of totally free books available (either through Amazon or other services). Unexpected downside - 3G service to my area is nil or spotty, so I have to go elsewhere to actually download sometimes. The real test will be crammed into a small coach seat on a cross-country flight."
1,Shame on Amazon,"If I could give a zero star, I would. No one should buy a product that allows anyone else to steal the content - even the seller of the e-book.Sorry Amazon, you lost a potential Kindle fan."
1,Paying to own nothing,"You're paying to own nothing, not even a quality of experience... Bad deal in my book, no pun intended.My suggestion is use the library, while they're still able to exist with the ever increasing copyright laws and ownership periods."
1,Glad my cousin's summer reading was deleted.,"Some of my cousin's summer reading was deleted off his Kindle. I've lost all interest in buying a device which lets a company invade the user's privacy to the extent of literally stealing purchased products off the reader.Sorry, Amazon. It's your fault for not doing due diligence on the books you sell, not the buyers. Stealing books people are in the middle of reading is not only wrong, it's frightening.I usually like you guys, but I'm going with a competitor when I get an e-book for my vacation this fall."
1,Haven't purchased and definitely won't now with recent developments,"I am not currently a Kindle owner, but with the recent events of Amazon revoking purchased e-books (George Orwell's 1984 & Animal Farm) this is the reason I won't be a Kindle owner anytime soon. DRM allowed Amazon to remove these purchased books from owner's that purchased them instead of doing their research and making sure that the publisher had the rights to sell these titles through Amazon's online marketplace. I've already gotten stiffed with DRM'ed music tracks on iTunes, I won't be giving into the possibility of loosing anything I've purchased because of another party's inability to do their part. Thanks, but no thanks, Amazon. Maybe when you make changes that I actually OWN the digital content that I've purchased then I'll become a ""Kindler""."
1,disillusioned.,"I understand the concept of only owning a license to material purchased through the Kindle service, but the idea that Amazon may at any time remotely delete information that I paid for from the device leaves me rather disinclined to purchase one of these. What's next? Will amazon also be deleting my own PDFs that I upload to the device? I think I'll be sticking with my trusty paperbacks for the time being. Perhaps one day Amazon will get a clue."
1,Great if they don't change their mind!,"Amazon removed all the George Orwell books from customers' Kindles who'd ALREADY PURCHASED AND DOWNLOADED the book(s)!If you want to buy the Kindle for ease of use, etc, perhaps you don't mind. But the idea that AMAZON gets to decide if you can keep it....well, that's a deal breaker for me. I'd like to know after I purchase a book that I get to keep it as long as I want....refund or no."
1,DRM abuse,"Amazon uses the DRM on the kindle to delete books that its users have paid for and remove features which they once had. This is a perfect example of how the users are tricked into thinking that they own the products and the software but really they don't. They are simply borrowing these things from Amazon and can have them taken away at any time. Its unfortunate that users don't understand what rights they have. But this is the nature of DRM and proprietary software. You are essentially signing an agreement that you don't actually own any of it. But you are led to believe that you do own it.If you do decide to buy a kindle understand that you may have your books deleted with no warning and there is nothing you can do about it. I encourage people to google words like DRM and open source software if they want to learn more. Learn about what free software really means, the freedom to have control over your own devices rather than signing that freedom away in an end user agreement."
1,DRM - Had a Kindle in my cart - Thank goodness I didn't purchase yet.,"I've been drooling over a Kindle for nearly a year. With the recent price drop, I had budgeted to purchase in August. Thank goodness that the 1984 fiasco happened now. If I had known a year ago that Amazon would resort to deleting content remotely, no way would I have wasted any time dreaming of a Kindle. I'm thinking e-book readers with no wireless hooks into my files and with no DRM are the way to go. Bye Bye Kindle. My desire for you has been completely dissolved."
2,I love kindle conceptually,"Kindle is a great concept but implementation fails in many ways. I got one 6 months ago and I can hardly find books I would like to read on Kindle. For example, you cant find single title from Hertha Muller (this years' Nobel laureate). I am not interested in mainstream bestsellers. Kindle file format is closed and by all means inferior to pdf. Kindle does not support pdf and conversion from pdf to kindle is very often poor. (small) Kindle is not suitable for technical books. Getting content from websites is not easy as it can be, probably due to the closed API. There are many reasons why kindle concept is great, but it deserves better implementation. I will probably skip next several versions of Kindle before getting new one."
3,Fantastic concept flawed by small screen due to useless keyboard,"The Kindle was revolutionary as it was a simple concept, easy to use, hassle free (no fees, no passwords, it works) and its screen invariably causes a Wow factor even today. It is crisp, your eyes love it. I own two iPads and several computers, but for long reading the kindle is perfect. Unfortunately, the version we have (second generation) has a too small screen due to the fact that the keyboard (pretty much useless) occupies a huge space. This was solved in the later generations."
1,Not working in little over 1 year!!,"Bought this one last July , suddenly the screen darkened and shows lines all over. called the service, ask me to pay $ 40 for the same one. what if it go bad again, Do not trust this product anymore!"
4,A Good read,"Nice type, easy to read, easy to hold. Only problem has been new book orders which sometimes take up to 12 hours to come through, rather than the 12 seconds or so that is implied."
5,Love My Kindle,I love my Kindle. My husband give it to me for Christmas and I have to say it was the best Christmas present he could have given me. We are military overseas and the new international downloads make our lives so much easier. I love the fact most of the books are cheaper on the Kindle then if I bought the printed book. As they should be for the fact they don't have the cost of printing a book. (Sadly some publishers are looking out for themselves and not the authors think they should get the same price as a printed book.) I have already started to replace my books that I read most often and plan to buy all my new books on Kindle. I also love the fact I can carry so many books with me everywhere I go. No worries that I don't have room for the 1000 page book I was reading.
5,Just got it!,"I am so excited to get my Kindle2 right on release day!! It was ready to go out of the box, already registered to me and the on screen walk through complete and easy to follow. I have already downloaded several free books and a few samples I am anxious to start reading!! Its light and the screen is great to view. Looking forward to using this daily!"
1,"Quickly, hide! The Book Fairy cometh.","I wanted to love the Kindle 2--the intuitive design alone had me sold, the convenience of having a virtual library in the palm of my hand being the icing on the cake.And then the Book Fairy struck, taking back my relative's copy of '1984'.Needless to say, I was tormented once again by memories long past--the dark days when words would inexplicably and randomly disappear from my word processing document, dare I take my eyes off my computer for even a minute (an IBM PS/1 [I believe that was the model], back in 1984).I've waited patiently to see if and WHEN a dilemma of this sort would arise--a book from my valued personal collection disappearing into thin air. I anguish to say one of my most feared horrors has become a reality--the Book Fairy, like the Grim Reaper, has stricken.No Kindle 2, DX, or whatever the version, for me. (I actually like to collect and KEEP books, PERMANENTLY.)"
3,Purchases are NOT permanent,"I am amazed to learn that books we buy may be taken away from our Kindle. If you have purchased 1984 (George Orwell), take a look at your Kindle. It is now longer there and you have received a refund. Amazon has taken it back. NOT GOOD!"
5,The Perfect Library,"This item was given to me as a birthday gift. It is the BEST gift I have ever received because it is essentially a personalized library for you to fill to your liking! Because the Kindle can hold 1,500 books I know that it will keep me busy for years to come. I love the fact that books are so much cheaper via the Kindle and that it helps the environment as well. Within this year I will save at the very least what the Kindle had cost. Lastly I adore the dictionary included in this spectacular device for I have strengthened my vocabulary immensely. Thank you Amazon for another amazing product!"
1,Too delicate. Cracked screen. Amazon says too bad.,"I loved my Kindle 2. However, the device is much too delicate. In regular usage the screen cracked, rendering the Kindle useless. Amazon will only fix the problem for $200 - most of the price of the product. Sadly, I can't afford to run through devices this easily, and the company doesn't stand behind its product quality."
3,Not Good For Money savers on books,"Tried the Kindle 2 and decided to return int...Pros1. Free internet access to email2. Free electronic books3. I can see potential for on the road RV'ers with access to lost of books and free email accessCons1. You can buy a lot of used books for $4 versus the common $9 price for Kindle books.2. You can't abuse it like a book and my books get messed up from highlighting, marking, side notes, bathroom reading, reading on a sandy beach or by a wet pool.3. You cant sell your Kindle books or give them to friends when your done with them."
1,Buyer Beware: Defective Device and Warranty,"Buyers Beware.Read the warranty before purchasing. When your Kindle breaks (mine lasted nine months), Amazon will only send you a refurbished device. Amazon will not repair your Kindle or replace it with a new device. So you will be getting a Kindle that was defective for some other reason as your replacement.That's not the ""customer centric"" approach I expected. So, you get one defective Kindle replaced with another provided you are in the one-year warranty period. If your Kindle breaks on the 13th month, I guess you will have not recourse whatsoever.And think about it...if Amazon has an inventory of refurbished devices, what does that tell us? It tells us that there are quality problems with the device."
1,Poor contrast is a dealbreaker,"It's with a very heavy heart that I'm returning my Kindle. I thought, mistakenly, that eink would be comparable to a regular dead-tree book. It isn't. Of course it's going to be a different experience for different people but for me the dark grey text on a light grey background was really hard to read & after 15 mins I would have eye strain and the beginnings of a headache. Surprisingly a bigger front made little difference. A crying shame as it would have been a fabulous product otherwise. I'll be keeping an eye out for the next generation with colour screens and hoping that the contrast will be closer to paper."
1,No Digital Restrictions Management!,"I don't want Amazon to control which books I read.I don't want Amazon to change or delete my library.I don't want to pay the price of a book for the mere right to read an ebook. I don't want to pay for my right to read at all.I want to own the books I paid for.I want to read the books I paid for wherever I want, to whomever I want, whenever I want. And I don't want Amazon or anybody else to watch me read their books, unless I invite them to.I want to read ebooks. But I don't want Kindle, because what Amazon and the industry calls ""Digital Rights Management"" in fact is a ""Digital Usage Control"". And I don't want to be controlled. I want the freedom of read, as much as I want the freedom of thought and the freedom of speech."
1,To Amazon: Please Steal My Money!,"To be able trust any party of Amazon ever again remains to be seen...but definitely not the Kindle, for sure!There's a class action lawsuit against Amazon for stealing/deleting books from people's Kindles (AND contrary to their contractual guarantee of providing a ""PERMANENT"" digital copy). Amazon thinks so little of its customers, it didn't bother to notify those affected, give them an explanation, OR a plan for how they'd fix it. Amazon ONLY published a generic ""apology"" after being taken to court.I'm no Luddite, and I think digital books have a place in human knowledge sharing, but be wary of a product like this which a corporation (or individual) can access & change without your awareness, review, & consent.I'm not sure how Sony's digital book reader was affected by Amazon's shoddy policies, but that may be a possible alternative...as long as it's not associated with the same book-buying (and DELETING) network."
2,Slick but NOT slick enough,"1)I am holding the future in my hands yet it is not where it needs to be.2) Pricey3) No Contrast controls: the contrast ratio's are poor at best. Reading in low light situations is difficult. Gray text on gray'ish background doesn't work.3) No night light: Can't read in bed while a partner sleeps nor low light situations.4) Hopefully Amazon rushes a ""hot fix"" to improve the readability; If not I will return the unit and wait for the next round.Future Wants:5) Reliance on documents is to heavy. I would have preferred a media rich device with MP3, MPEG (movie), Color and Cell phone bundle. Rumors infer that Apple ""may"" bring one to market soon. Not an Apple fanatic but go Apple.6) Cell phone with bluetooth would have been sweet. The capabilities obviously are there with ATT's Kindle/internet link.7) As with the iPhone, true operating systems in these devices may make them more useful as they ""right size"" for media accessibility/portability."
2,Not what i expected,"I own the original Kindle My friend purchased the new Kindle 2. I would've thought adding a inner light was in the works but I was wrong! Needs a inner light bad. Original Kindle has the option of having a SD card to further expand your library to 4,000 titles. Not so with the new Kindle. There is no SD card so the Kindle is maxed out to 1,500 titles. Hmmmm. The power button is annoying.Its a hold for a few seconds kinda thing. I like my simple on/off switch.Yes there are new features; the ""cursor"" is better for highlighting a word for definition or an annotation.The outer buttons such as page turner is moved for a better grip and unneccessary page turning. But over all, I like my original better. Just SCREAMING for a inner light! The clip on lights just don't do the trick."
1,Today 1984 Tomorrow the World!!,"The Kindle One had an SD card slot, the Kindle Two does not, meaning there is no way to safeguard yourself, or your purchases from Amazon coming in and deleting it; doubleungood.This truly is a DRM nightmare come to life, and I suspect a publicity nightmare for Amazon. What happens if other books disappear, they did it once, and they can do it again."
5,Where is the back light?,"I love it. As a librarian I have always been in love with the printed page. I always have at least one, if not two or three books in my bag where ever I go. My bag has been heavy, but is lightened considerably now by my new Kindle 2.I look forward to taking my Kindle traveling with me.I seem to read faster and there are many obscure and odd books that I like to read that I can get for pennies.The only thing I don't like, is there is no way to back-light the text for a dark room or airplane. Oh well, my book light still works.In the next incarnation, I would prefer a backlight option rather than a vocal option. Don't like listening, love reading."
5,Efficiency and fun,"I truly find the Kindle to be an efficient and fun product to use ..Not only is the book selection awesome , but I didn`t realize how many were `free`.The speed of the downloads are are very fast . I need to explore further..Kudos to you guys!"
4,kindle 2,the kindle 2 is awesome!!!! i read so much more than a regular book. the pages go by so fast i forget what time it is sometime. i would recommend this book to people who have lots of time on their hands and LOVE TO READ!!!
5,KRAZY ABOUT KINDLE 2!!,"I love it. It's very small with a perfect size screen. It's a perfect travel companion. Downloads are fast. The payment system is ""seemless"" with Amazon. I LOVE IT!!GMG"
4,Listening to audio,"I've only had my Kindle for a few days but I love most of it. However, I tried listening to two different books. Well, either there is a six-year-old with a deep voice, or a computer generated voice, or someone who has never read a book in his life is doing the reading. This reader has never heard of punctuation or inflection. He mispronounces words and ignores commas, periods, and even beginnings of chapters -- just keeps on reading ""words."" I like listening to books on tape when I'm driving, but about a half hour of this was more than I could tolerate -- or barely understand. I think the audio feature should be downplayed -- it sure isn't one of the better points.I do really like being able to look up words. I really like the desktop pics, too."
4,Love the Kindle,"I have been an owner of the Kindle 1 and the Kindle 2. I was very pleased with the Kindle 1 but I often found that when I put it down or went to speek to someone, I often lost my place or the page I was on. This does not happen witht the Kindle 2 and the slimmer design is much easier to hold. I bought the Kindle 2 because of the audio option. My daughter is just getting into books but has a difficulity reading large kids books. I figured this would be a great option and I would save on audio books. It is okay. Much more computer generated than the audio books and tends to sound ""run on"".I know the idea is to have the Kindle read just like a book and not a computer but it would be excellent if they could incorporate a light. I would be off buying the kindle 3.Michelle"
3,three stars,"The only reasons I give the Kindle 3 star as opposed to 5 are the screen (i wish it were just a bit lighter) and the book options. I love this thing. I really do. I recommend it, but it just simply doesn't offer the books I really want.So, as a device for travel and reading, yes, get this thing. But if you want to read anything from the beat writers, hunter s thompson etc, stick with your books. Just 4 out of 5 times I have look for a specific book the Kindle fails to offer it.it will get better, I hope. I love the thing, I just want better choices."
5,My Kindle,"I love it. It is the perfect travel companion, and actually saves me money in the long run with the volume of books I read. Truly an excellent value"
1,1984 is the object of itself,"So, I buy a book about how the powers running the world can change history by simply re-writing it. And it turns out that the powers running amazon.com can do just that. By deleting the book.It is not scandalous that amazon.com did delete books that people had bought and paid for. (Although it is incredible irony that they picked 1984 and Animal House.)What is frightening is that they can.I'm going to stick to hard copies. Nobody has yet come knocking at my door to claim any bootleg copies I might have.Dave Hay"
1,"Stick With Physical Books, They Can't Be Deleted !","I was thinking of getting this. Since It saves space.But, upon hearing the news that Amazon can remotely deletea book purchased, and the only consolation is a refund, I decidedotherwise. Stay away from this. (Physically)own the book instead.Yup, it certainly saved space, remote deletion WILL DO that !"
4,"I've Test Driven Them Both, Kindle By a Landslide","I've had my Kindle for 3 months, and I couldn't be happier. A relative got me a Nook for Christmas not knowing that I had a Kindle. I decided to try out the Nook for the heck of it and to say the least I was stunned. It kept locking up and was dreadfully slow. You almost need a club for the touchscreen. Every time I tried to search the B&N store, the screen would flash and take me back to the start-up page. The button for turning the page was stiff, turning pages on the Nook was much slower,there was no web browser on the Nook, and the keyboard was so small that I couldn't touch just one letter at a time, they really need to include a stylus if they're going to continue selling these. I've never written a review before, but after my experience with the Nook, it is a long way off to even coming close to my Kindle. If you are considering an e-reader, save your time researching the Nook, it is just not nearly as good and friendly as the Kindle."
4,Love my Kindle,"Have had my kindle for about a week and am becoming addicted to it. We travel a lot and I can never leave home without at least three books, so this saves a lot of space and weight in my suitcase. It's comfortable to use and to hold. I like the fact that the manual is built right in so I can look up another feature as I get to it. The best feature of all is the built in dictionary! I can look up any word in less than a second and go right on reading!!! I also like to highlight passages and make notes, especially for my book club selections. This toy was made for me! My only complaint is that the 5 way button does so much and I seem to touch it the wrong way and lose my place. For some reason it doesn't always go back to where I was reading and I have to stop and search a little. I'm sure this is my fault and not my Kindle's but I can't seem to find a solution - yet."
5,OUTSTANDING,"Like I said in my review of the black leather cover, this was a birthday gift. I have talked to many people about the KINDLE and everyone has praised it highly. I wasn't sure that I would like reading a book like this, but I will probably never buy another book. The real truth is I am reading faster than ever before because I was able to increase the size of the font. The battery really last a long time and it has been perfect for all the traveling I do. People on the planes are always asking me about it. I plan on getting one for each of my daughters and husband for their birthdays this year.Amazon, you really have a hit. Please see if you can do something like the NOOK is doing as far as getting to share books with others who have the KINDLE. This would be another great marketing tool.LOVE, LOVE MY KINDLE!!!!!"
4,Kindle Wireless,I am enjoying the Kindle and the opportunity to preview books and even carry around multiple books at once without breaking my arms. My only issue is I forget to charge it and have had occasion to not have enough power to read when there was no alternate source--but that is really my bad.
5,A senior with RA that needed help holding a book.,"At 73 years of age, with RA, it was difficult for me to hold a book. I received my Kindle for my birthday, and now, I am never without it. I have found it to be exactly as advertised and more. I have read some of the other reviews and I can't believe any one that has read the instructions could have any problems with this product. I recently had eye surgery which only improved my ability to read without eye strain or glasses. So. keep adding more books to Kindle, I love the convenience of ordering, buying, receiving and reading all within the same five minutes. THANKS AMAZON."
1,censorship is not ok,I simply can't accept a product that is loaded with DRM and that can be used to revoke purchases after they are made. Books are at the center of free speech and expression-- the future of books can't be built on censorship and control. We need open ebook readers.
1,1984,"You can buy a Kindle, but you can't buy books on it. Amazon can take away what you have at any time. And they've shown numerous times that they will."
2,I loved my kindle BUT.....,I have had my Kindle1 for over 3 years and have loved it. I almost upgraded to a Kindle2 recently and am I glad that I did not waste my money. All of a sudden new books are not available in ebook format- they say the publishers are squabbling with Amazon over how much of a profit they can squeeze out of the customer. Penquin books are not available- as are several other publishers. They were offered for pre sale but as soon as the book is published the ebook is pulled. Do not buy a kindle or nook or any other ebook reader unless you are willing to wait until they decide how much to take you for. I will not be buying these books in print either. Boycot these publishers- don't buy there products- sorry authors.
1,Too Delicate,"Owned less than 6 months, worked as described until I dropped it on my bedroom floor, (less than 4 feet onto thick padded carpet) hasn't worked since. No warranty. In my opinion this device should be designed to withstand this type of daily wear and tear."
5,Kindle 2,"I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this item and many of them cried about all the things it didn't do.The Kindle2 is a portable library. It is light-weight and compact. The screen is supposed to be similar to looking at the paper pages in a book and therefore easier than staring at a backlit computer screen which I certainly do enough of each day. It is all of these things. And in all the complaints I read about the things it didn't do.. well, those people just need a regular computer. That's what they are looking for and there are plenty of tiny little computers out there. You want apps? Can't live without twittering and updating facebook? Then get an I phone you can download books on that too.I wanted something to carry with me where ever I went and not to have to choose which book to bring along. I needed to stop collecting shelves and shelves of books that are collecting dust and taking up space.The kindle2 is everything I thought it would be and then some."
1,Buy a book - Save your money,"I owned my Kindle for about a year when it died completely. We found out from Amazon that you must send the unit back to have it checked, and/or have the battery replaced. You cannot buy a battery and insert it. You MUST send the unit back.I don't know about you, but I find that ridiculous. Bottom line? None of my books have ever 'broken' and/or required a new battery. I don't mind hefting a good book, nor do I mind packing 3 or 4 to take on a trip.Nothing reads like a book, nothing feels like a book, nothing smells like a book.Forget buying the Kindle - save your money and frustration and buy a book instead. In fact, buy ten! You'll still save money in the long run."
4,Question on choice,I am contemplating between a Kindle 2 and a Nook from B&N. Can anyone give me insight as to why you prefer one over the other?
2,Save your money buy an iPAD,"The Kindle is okay, BUT why buy one when the iPAD is 200 times better, and cheaper !!"
2,It may have a bright future,"I have just read reviews with the rating 1. It is clear that there is still lots of hard work to impress people. And it is very expensive to download foreign newspapers, like Zurich Zeitung or similar one from Frankfurt. Yes, Guys, it is very expensive!!! I do not mention highly specialized technical books. Good luck in your business - it is only easy to make money out of ""spice girls"" or out of ""below average personality""!!!"
1,Customer Service,"The Kindle is a great product. However, after I purchased the device on a Friday, Amazon lowered the cost on Monday. I sent an inquiry to Amazon about a credit from a customer service perspective, ie, grandfather the cost decrease. Amazon did not say no they simply did not reply to my inquiry. So much for customer service."
3,Not Quite There Yet,"I'm an audio book guy [...], but I cannot get all the books I have on audio. Right now, I listen on my ipod touch. Kindle is not quite right for me yet. I'm going to wait for a larger hard drive (or at least the ability to plug in a flash drive to add more memory) and likely the price to come down. I'm just not convinced that it is worth [...] yet."
4,The Earths most Customer-centric Company,Bought the Kindle 2 at the end of June 2010. The device performs well and does all it says on the box. I would have liked Amazon to tell me at the time of ordering that the new Kindle was about to be launched but they took my money in the sure knowledge that the device was about to be upgraded to a higher specification at a lower price and also available from Amazon UK. Amazon claim to be the Earths most Customer-centric Company. Make up your own mind on that! By the time I found out about the launch of the new Kindle my 30 day return period was over and I was told to take a hike.
5,A Kindle Blessing,"The Kindle was purchased for my wife. She is having a problem with her eyes. Understand that she is 75 years old and is not a computer user. I mentioned this to her and she said no because it would be too hard to learn. I decided to look in to e-readers a little more and found that most required the use of a wi-fi system in the home. I was shocked that the Kindle did not. I went ahead and ordered it and am so very pleased that I did. Now with the larger print available through the Kindle she is now able to enjoy reading again. She goes no where with out the Kindle. She know how to use it as far as basics go (turning it on, and off, bringing up the book she wants to read and turning pages). Somtimes she get stuck and then I help but she loves it. It's easy to use, easy to download a book and light enough to take anywhere. I highly recommend this product."
1,Screen freeze,"I would never buy another kindle. Just look at their own site on the problem of screens freezing. When I called customer service the answer was "" too bad you're out of warrantee."" Wrote to CEO who also does not care that this product has a serious defect. If it were a car it would be recalled. Not worth taking a chance when there is a free app on I-pad and other good purchase choices."
5,Kindle,A great way to surprise my husband with a gift. He loves his Kindle and has beeb kind enough to share it with out eleven year old daughter too! It was received and packaged very well.
5,Sweet,"I am very happy with the purchase, delivery, and quality of my purchase. Amazon has it all at a great price."
2,Disappointed in the Netherlands,"When I saw that it was now possible to buy a Kindle outside the US, I jumped on it and bought one immediately. The product itself is pretty good, no complaints here, but then I think there are too many restrictions for non-US buyers to make the choice worthwhile.- Kindle books are generally more expensive than printed books, I did not expect that at all.- Magazines are very expensive too, and no pictures. What is a magazine without pictures?- I really wanted to read some new books, from Dan Brown or Zafon for example. But these are unavailable here. I still have to buy a paper edition if I want to stay up-to-date. But the whole point of buying the Kindle is to travel lighter and to save a tree or two.- I wanted to easily read a load of technical e-books I have, in PDF format. The Kindle is not good at displaying them, and you have to go through an awkward conversion process.- Books in Dutch? Magazines in Dutch?Maybe I should have bought a Sony."
5,Exactly what I wanted...,"I'm currently going to college out of state... I also read about 7 books a week. It's extremely hard to move ALL my books from home to dorm and back. I have exactly what I want in the Kindle. All my books in one place. I don't really care about where the next page button is or the functionality of the keyboard. I can read any book in my collection anywhere! I just pull it out of my backpack! I have had a Sony Reader before. The Kindle is just as good, but the Kindle also has a spank keyboard and internet access. Internet access that, might I add, allows me to go onto almost any website (mangafox & onemanga) and read books. I <3 the Kindle. It does everything I want it to."
5,Kindle Klub,I bought the Kindle for my wife's birthday and she loves it! Two of her friends are each getting one and they agreed to download different books and swap Kindles around. A Kindle Klub!
2,No backlight....,"How can such a modern electronic product, meant to be read, meant to not encroach on those near by not have a backlight? For $259 it should be a no brainer..."
2,Global Wireless Review???,"So many people are reviewing the Kindle device with U.S. Whispernet that is NO LONGER AVAILABLE!Enough already! We're glad that you love what you bought --- but we newbies can't buy it.PLEASE comment on your U.S experience with the Global Wireless 6"" Kindle that was shipped after Christmas. This is what is available now! What's your experience??"
2,Disappointing Content Availability,"I was all ready to purchase this, but then I found out that a lot of content is not available outside of the US. Seriously. I can go to any bookstore in Canada and buy Pirate Latitudes, but it is not available for download in Canada? It made me realize just how immature the format is. I'm not sure when the US will wake up and stop excluding Canada from it's market for digital media, but until it does, you won't be seeing any of my $$."
1,gray screen hard to read,"When I first turned on the Kindle, I was shocked at how difficult it was to SEE with the gray background.I have an iPod and ASSUMED the Kindle screen would be as easy to read as that, but it's not the case. Even when I adjust the font, it's not the SIZE of the print, but the color of the background that makes it so difficult to read.I LOVE the ease of ordering books, magazines, newspapers, etc but ""if I had it to do over again"" would NOT have purchased it. At night, I find it's easier just to grab a regular book (that doesn't need to be held so close to the light) as it's brighter and MUCH easier to read.Oh, well.Just read in the New Yorker that there are places where you can go to SEE one before purchasing, but I wasn't aware of that option before.File under ""live and learn.""LOVE the concept, but HATE the gray difficult-to-read background."
3,Slightly Dissapointed,"The biggest complaint is that you cannot clear a book title from your purchased list once you have bought it.It is on your list forever! An aggravating feature or dumb oversight? Buying the ""Kama Sutra"" might be embarrassing if you ever plan to let the kids or Mom use the Kindle. The ""Next Page"" transition is a bit slow too. Expected it to be faster."
5,Compact & comfortable,"The Kindle 2 is a phenomenal way to read. The slimness of the Kindle makes it easy to hold while the screen allows for a large amount of text to be visible. With the 6 varying font sizes, almost everyone should find a range that is comfortable. The battery seems to hold a charge for a fair amount of time. The Kindle is fairly user friendly and you can begin reading within a short time span."
5,"Kindle - 6""","Absolutely fabulous invention, particularly considering our overly full library. Now I can continue to collect books without worrying about how to store them - and it is lightweight and easy to read. I am very, very pleased."
5,Time Saver,Great product for those of us who live in rural America and want more reading options than Wal-Mart allows. I really appreciate the book sample option and the instant availablilty of books.
5,This is the future,"Absolute genius. Easy to read in any position. I can now read in public whatever I like without anyone interrupting for my opinion of the book! No more guilt about what to do with the book when I'm finished because my bookshelves are overflowing, Easy to shop and easy to download. Even tho I give this 5 stars, there are some needed improvements. Perhaps a non slip back with a clear hard plastic case instead of a leather carrying case would better serve everyday use. A great benefit to the working community if books like National Underwriters were available to download. What about text books for college? All in all, this product will change how we live. I can't wait until everyone is on board."
4,"Neat device, but needs graphic ability!","I'm very pleased with our Kindle, except for the ability to show pictures. The range of available literature is huge, though some is more expensive than I think necessary. I especially like the ability to change the type size and also the International coverage which permits downloading almost everywhere without a computer! I'd recommend this to my friends - and have done so!"
4,Kindle Birthday Gift,Purchased this Kindle as a gift for my wife. She seems very please with all of the features of the Kindle. She purchased a Sony reader for me for Christmas which does not have the same features as the Kindle. I whis she had purchased the Kindle for me.
1,Why bother?,"Why bother buying a Kindle? When it first came out, fine, but now? It is simply not worth the money. How many of us have I-Pods or ""smart"" phones? How many people have computers? Exactly. Now that Amazon has made Kindle books available for literally everyone why should anyone consider buying a Kindle? I really have no idea. If I could return mine I certainly would as my entire reason for purchasing it (ease of download, ready availability of books at reasonable price) has vanished now that Amazon has seen fit to make the Kindle redundant by offering Kindle Books to anything with an internet connection. I simply do not need it. In fact, even though small at least my I-Touch is backlit!!! DO NOT BOTHER BUYING THIS PRODUCT. Amazon has really made us who have for suckers."
3,Bill's Kindle review,"What happens when the Kindle's battery loses its ability to hold a charge? I didn't see anything in the documentation about that.How does one replace it?How much will it cost?The documentation is excellent.Reading on it is easy.I like the fact that it uses reflected light, like a book, rather than having it backlit. I'm told that it also prolongs battery life between recharging.You did not have the first 3 books I tried to order.You charge almost full price for a book, yet I cannot give it away or re-sell it.It is excellent for travel.I'd like to see more serious textbooks, especially in math and the sciences.Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, U.S. Wireless)"
4,"Kindle, Latest Generation","I love my Kindle. Convienient, easy to read. Only thing it is missing is a backlit light for dim rooms."
4,Audio Enabled??,"I traveled for a trip and had used my audio book and thought it would be great to download an audio enabled book on my new Kindle. First, the good. Downloading the audio enabled text was quick. I pulled over on the I-5 and had it in about 1.5 minutes. Now the bad, the selection of audio enabled books is limited. Next, the ""voice"" sounds a bit robotic and without inflection. Then, the speakers are located in the back and I was unable to locate a volume control. Finally, if you want an audio book, purchase an audio book, this is not the Kindle's strong point. The Kindle is great for what it is an electronic book."
5,Kindle 2nd Generation!,I love my Kindle 2nd Generation! It has the same size screen that a regular paperback and you can turn pages from either side and it's light and easy to carry everywhere you go. It fits easily into your purse or tote. I found the 9 inch screen to be heavy. I would highly recommend it.
5,Kindle 2,"This is the best thing ever made. I have purchased 2 units for wife and I and they go every place with us. Easy on the eye screen, light weight, fast downloads. Why carry anything else. No more box of books while traveling, kids and operate while on the road. Don't leave home without it."
1,DRM is 1984. 1984 got pulled. We don't want anyone dictating what to read,"This product is infected with Digital Restriction Management. It is a disease and can very easily be abused to control what people should read and not read. These are steps towards pure dictatorship. Read the book 1984, and understand what DRM is all about. Please fight it with all your might. It may sound small, but every step is small, but combined, they make a extremely scary road.This whole product is defective by design and might well remove your books if Amazon doesn't find them politically correct."
1,"Cannot buy Kindle books as I only use non-US credit card, which is the same card I used to purchase Kindle 2!!","I think Amazon needs to make the restriction related to overseas credit card very clear to all customers. I am vacationing with my family in the States and decided to buy a Kindle 2 for my husband as anniversary present. I purchased the Kindle 2 with my visa issued by a bank in China WITH NO DIFFICULTY. However, when I tried to buy a book using the same credit card, I was rejected for geographic reason. Later, browsing through more info, I read about the restriction of using non-US credit card. I am still in the US but I cannot use an overseas card to make a purchase to try out the Kindle!! WHY DOES AMAZON LET ME PURCHASE THE KINDLE WITH AN OVERSEAS CREDIT CARD AND THEN REFUSE TO LET ME BUY ANY KINDLE BOOKS! [ASIN:B00154JDAI Kindle: Amazon's 6"" Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)]]"
1,Kindle 2,"-Not including a case. = 1 star-Holding the on/off button for 4 seconds to turn off. = 1 star-Not disclosing the fact that the dx was coming out this summer when i boughtit in february. = (minus 3 stars)-Being able to download books, newspapers, magazines, blogs without a pc onthis very good reader. = 4 stars= Average: 1 star"
3,Kindle ok - Case/Cover Disgusting,The kindle came in a leather Amazon case/cover. The case/cover was disgusting! It was covered in what looked like bird poop. I put gloves on to take the cover off. I then disinfeced the Kindle. The Kindle itself looks & works great. This was a Christmas present so I'm very glad I had it shipped here instead of to the gift recepient. I would have been VERY EMBARASSED if they had opened this and saw the nasty cover!!!
4,Happy,It was a great gift. The kindle is cool to read from. Didn't think I would like not having a book.
1,Useless in Canada.,Can't stream anything in Canada. That says it all. I never knew fiction books were classified reading. This is a silly rule for content.
5,The Greatest,"I love my Kindle 2. I had been interested on getting one ever since they first came out. However, I decided to wait. I'm so excited to own it. It's the greatest."
5,love my kindle,I just love my Kindle. I took it to the beach and was able to read in the brightest sun without any problem. It so great to travel with. I highly recommend it.
5,The Kindle is Brilliant!,"It's very easy to read, its easy to use, the keyboard is handy, and it's light and very stylish. I even managed to upload a PDF commic and it was pretty good for that too. Plus I get to feel all Star Trek on the train commute :)I love my Kindle!"
2,poor service,"I purchased a Kindle ( which I am very happy with) just two weeks before Amazon lowered the price from $359 to $299. I asked Amazon to make a price adjustment for the difference since it was within the 30 days of purchase, now a fairly normal business practice. Amazon was difficult to get a hold of and when I finally made contact with them they outright refused to make the price adjustment. I rank Amazon as VERY poor customer service. J.M."
4,Kindle,"I'm very happy with my Kindle. Unfortunately, the price was reduced $60 1 week after I ordered it, which reduced the enjoyment."
3,"No more used books, loaning to a friend, etc.","This device, if pervasive, would kill the used book market.You also can't pass a book on to a friend when you are finished, can't donate it to charity, etc."
1,"Revoking ""permission"" to books?","I'm going to stick with printed books, that way Amazon can't decide to withdraw my ability to read it. [...]I find it rather ironic that Amazon have recently deleted Kindle copies of George Orwell's 1984.Stick with printed books: you buy them, they're yours."
1,"save your money, make room for more books","I was so excited, a constant reader and living in our down-sized home, finding a way to reduce the space my books and periodicals takes up was so high on my list of ""gotta haves.""That was three months ago. So far I have not been able to transfer content from my computer to the Kindle3 and sitting right in front of my laptop with the broadband on, it does not recognize my connectivity. Several calls to Kindle customer service have been wothless, and forget ""whispernet"" anywhere outside of major metropolitan areas. The thing just doesn't work and I want my money back. The entire experience has made me give a second thought to the money I spend with Amazon. This is a piece of junk. I wish I could give it negative stars because it would be ""negative"" five."
5,Love it!,I love my Kindle! It's so easy to use and very easy to take along on a trip. We travel a lot and I constantly have to have my husband take me to a bookstore when I run out of reading material. I am currently building my Kindle library to take with me on a trip in April. Don't know what I ever did without it!
4,kindle 2 review,just spent flights back and forth to Tokyo with it. Easy to learn to operate. Has the feel of a paperback. Really liked dictionary and reference lookups. Tried accessing internet in Sea-Tac it's not easy to navigate. After 5 to 6 hours reading became a strain but I guess a paperback would also. Would like to do it with a Sony to see the difference.
5,"Excellent, but","I bought the kindle and it works just fine and infact is excellent. But the problem is that a number of books that I wanted to read are not available in kindle. Effectively making it less useful. And even after buying the kindle, I kept on buying books.To me it is like having a computer without a software. I hope Amazon will work on this problem.Thus unless you plan to read only those books that are released recently, I would not recommend it as a best buy."
3,Kindle Reader,I am enjoying the Kindle very much. I like the ease of use and downloading reading matter. My one fault would be that it does not contain a backlight for night reading.
5,Best Reading Device Ever,"I have been reading books for years.I'm so glad that I bought the kindle it makes reading so much better. You can change the font so that the print is larger which is better for the eyes as ones gets older. I have over 100 books on my shelf to read, So unfortunately I have to go back in forth between kindle and paper back. But all my new books to buy are kindle editions. Buy one you'll love it."
3,Overseas and disappointed,"I am somewhat disappointed that the overseas rights for purchasing books on my Kindle is not what I expected it to be. The device itself works great and I really love using it, but I've found the material available in Australia is very limited compared to what is available in the US. There are still some decent titles available but not nearly as many as I was led to believe from the Amazon web site there would be. I can only hope that over time more titles will be added so that those of us living overseas can access a bigger selection."
3,Gift Idea,"I purchased this item for my sister as a X'mas gift. This is probably the best and most practical gift I ever purchased, but it is only for Real Readers."
2,kindle UK model,"I love the Kindle, but the lack of web access is a real let down,This could be a very exciting tool it it was availible in the UK, I will still use my Kindle daily but it would be so usefull if it was internet enabled.The future I hope, will bring this service to the UK."
1,News broke just in time,"As a teacher, I really wanted this machine and have been waiting for the price to drop so that I could give myself the excuse to purchase it.Wow. All of the reasons that I was thinking of not purchasing became prescient today. Amazon steals back and will delete the books and erase the notes that you purchase and create on the Kindle. My other concern was that they would read or reveal your notes that you keep on the Kindle. I guess their actions prove that they will.Today, Amazon just killed off their product with great potential. Can you imagine a corporation erasing a file from a machine that YOU own and paid a huge sum for?Trust is now dead."
5,Love My Kindle 3G 2nd generration refurbished,I am very happy and feel that I got a great deal on this kindle. A freind suggested a certain type and model and I have not been dissatisfied at all. I love it and am happy with the shipping and quality of the product!!
1,Kindle2 disadvantages,"The kindle 2 has no page numbers so you can follow your reading, It has spaces in the text where a letter or word should be thus disrupting your reading. the dictionary defines a word (sometimes) with the word itself. That cannot happen. There may or maynot be an index, bibliography, etc. at the end of the book. the captions underneath the pictures, maps, charts, graphs, etc. have very tiny printing and thus a very large magnifying glass is required to read underneath. Most times one cannot read it. You cannot enhance the image whatsoever, There is no light to read in the background at night. The leather case is essential and needed for the Kindle 2. The bookmarks appear to be useless."
4,An excellent E-reader,"The Kindle works rather well. You can send a book to your Kindle via Amazon's web site or log on to the Kindle store right on the unit itself. The electronic delivery is fast. Readability is easy. It is just like reading a printed page. I enjoy reading outside, and the display does not wash out in the sunlight as my Palm e-reader does. I have already downloaded several books to my Kindle. I am a bit dissapointed though, that there are still some books not available on the Kindle that I would like to read."
5,Kindles are Great,I love my Kindle. I do a lot of reading and it is nice to carry a Kindle when traveling rather than a pile of books. One of my favorite features on the kindle is being able to adjust font size. This comes in handy for me when I read while running on a treadmill. The small font in most books make them difficult to read while running on a treadmill when running faster than 5 miles per hour.I wish it had a back light on the screen. This would make it easier to read in low light conditions.
5,My wife loves it,This was the second Kindle I have purchsed for her. Several years ago my wife saw all of these people reading Kindles by the pool in Mexico and she really wanted one. I bought her one for Christmas that year and this last year I bought her this new one. She loves being able to down load books from the library with it.
5,Love it,I loved my kindle. Fast service from this seller. I would buy from this seller again. I love my kindle.
4,"""an old friend""","And 3 years later...I still think its the best e-reader out there. I have spent countless sleepless nights reading books through this little gadget. I now have an ipad with the kindle app but for some reason, I still prefer using my kindle when reading e-books. It has also accompanied me on numerous road trips. Just consider it an old friend you want to keep while making new friends (like the ipad)."
1,Fantastic hardware attached to abusive terms of service,"I have been reading ebooks for a number of years now, sometimes off a computer screen, sometimes on my Palm, more recently on my netbook. I must say that the Kindle has been truly tempting me since it's release. The idea of an e-ink device coupled with the wireless store and some of the other fantastic features of the Kindle are truly luscious.Unfortunately Amazon's terms of services basically reduce ""buying"" books from them to ""renting on sufferance"". You can keep the books for a time (if we don't decide to delete them). You can only read them on this one device. Oh, and don't even think about having our text-to-speech engine read you robotic bedtime stories (screw you vision impaired people!) You can re-download them (until we tell you you can't - but we won't tell you how downloads is too many!).Amazon, why don't you want my money? Why can't you just provide good hardware and software and allow me to *buy* books from you?"
2,Not with current DRM Restrictions,"I was very interested in the Kindle 2 until I read Amazons Digital Rights Management (DRM) restrictions for e-books. I'll never ever buy a Kindle of any kind until I am able to purchase an e-book, export and use it on any another device or lend or give it to someone else like any other paper book I own. Being forced to keep your library of e-books on Amazon and not being able to keep or use your own purchased copies of e-books except on other Kindle devices is bad news. By purchasing Kindle, you are accepting loss of freedom and it's just a damn greedy shame."
1,Beware of Defective Kindles!!,"I bought a refurbished unit through Amazon's Warehouse Deals. It arrived DOA, would not charge, would not turn on. I called customer service and the helpful rep said they'd send a new one. They promptly sent a confirming email about the replacement and then never shipped it. Called back to find out why and after multiple holds this time they sheepishly said they would not send a replacement out for a refurbished unit. So I was told to send it back and they'd refund my money once they received it and, then, I could order a new one. Would have been nice if they stood by their products that they claim to have refurbished, or at least replaced them when they said they would.A disappointment."
1,The Kindle Drop Test is Fiction. Do Not Believe That the Kindle can withstand a gentle drop.,"I recently purchased my Kindle and was more than pleased with it. Yesterday, I dropped it from a height less than the ""Drop Test""height(used in sales promotion) and the upper right corner will not display. I spoke to a tech in Costa Rica and we attempted to reboot. That did not work. My only other option is to purchase another Kindle for $135.00. There are no warnings as to the fragility of the Kindle. I never expected that such a slight accident would result in the need to purchase a completely new reader. I had a ployeurathane M-Edge protector on my Kindle to protect it from just such accidents. I feel very bad about the product but like the concept and the portaility so much that I am spending the additional money but do so feeling duped and treated unfairly by Amazon. I will handle my reader with great care as I really don't want to purchse another one at the $135.00 price."
4,Gift for the wife,Bought this for my wife for christmas and she absolutely loved it. She uses it everyday. Easy to get and load new books and saves shelf space since all the books are on this little tablet.
5,Old is often best,"I love my ""old"" Kindle: it is lighter, easier to hold, simpler to operate, and holds a charge longer than the Kindle Fire. Also, you don't need WiFi to download books. I have a Kindle Fire which I tolerate but rarely use. It was a gift so I'm stuck with it. It turned out to be complex to operate and very sensitive to any touch -- pages flying ahead; and it doesn't keep my place in the book. My ""old"" Kindle has everything I need and is very satisfactory. Thanks for letting me sound off! Sally D."
4,where is the light?,"i'm in love with my kindle except for the fact that the keyboard cannot be lighted. i trust that the new edition will feature the option to light the keyboard from an internal source rather than an external source. charge extra, and most of us will pay for that feature. allow those of us who want the ""light"" feature to trade our used kindles in for the newer lighted kindles. looking forward!"
2,Wireless is Sporadic..,Wireless is Sporadic. I gave the Kindle as a Christmas Gift. I should have checked to see who the wireless carrier was before buying. In Tennessee where the present went is only served by AT&T; and Verizon Wireless correctly all the other wireless companies pretend to provide coverage and only in the larger cities.When the stars align and the wireless gods are smiling then it's great. Wireless coverage comes and goes and Amazon would by wise to change it to AT&T; or Verizon. I will take this a step further. Amazon should ask when purchasing this product what wireless company would you prefer because we all know what cell phone companies work in our area of the country.
3,"Easily Broken, No Warranty, Very Fragile","Was given the Kindle as a gift in December. In January, it fell off a shelf and dangled from its cord briefly. The Kindle is ruined. The plug, which is fine, no longer will plug into the Kindle, thus rendering it useless. I talked to Amazon, NO WARRANTY, they offered to sell me a new one at a reduced price! If this thing is that delicate, they should warn you, or they should have a real warranty, or at least a way to repair it. Now I have to send the damaged one back in (so they can repair it no double for five cents) in order to get the lower price replacement.The man I spoke with was very nice, but not helpful. He wanted to charge the full shipping and handling although I have Amazon Prime. I had to be very insistent to get it shipped free and fast.I also agree with those of you complaining about mis-spelled words in the text of books. It drives me bonkers.Otherwise, this gizmo is handy and interesting. I just wish it had lasted longer than six weeks."
1,Killing the Golden Goose,I love going to used book stores and yard sales and looking for paperback books that interest me. I was delighted to receive a Kindle for Christmas knowing that I could find my favorite authors for under $10. Quite a bit more than yard sale prices but within my budget. Now I am disappointed to learn that you have caved into publishers and will be raising the prices for books significantly. You will be losing my business and I'm sure many others as well. My Kindle will turn into an expensive paperweight. Another great idea ruined by greed. The goose is dead.
5,kindle2,"I love this product. My wife has the first generation Kindle and it has some button issues. This Kindle is a lot better. The only thing that would improve the Kindles is the ability to share books from one Kindle to another, but in the same family, that way Amazon still makes a profit but customers in the same house hold could share their books."
5,gift for my husband,What a great gift. I bought the Kindle for my husband for his birthday and he absolutely loved it. Best gift ever. It was something out of the ordinary. Great for traveling.
4,Suggestions for Kindle,"I received the Kindle 2 as a birthday present. My vision is failing, and I find the Kindle much easier to read than a printed book. A few suggestions:1) offering even larger font sizes would be great. I use the largest font now, but it would be good if there were options for even larger font sizes.2) it would be great if the screen lit up --- eg, a backlight so that we could read even when lighting conditions are not ideal3) the text-to-speech is AWFUL -- the intonations are all wrong, sentences are broden up in the wrong places etc.4) the Kindle makes a 'click' each time you turn a page. This has proved distracting to the people right next to me. Can the switch be made quieter?"
5,I take it everywhere with me.,"I have the K2 (US version) and I love it. I am an avid reader and take it everywhere with me because you never know when you can read a chapter. I thought it was going to be amazing before I bought it, but was even more amazed after. The amount of Free, cheap, and even the price of the bestsellers is wonderful. I have discovered so many new great Authors and found so many new genre's of books it is unbelievable. Indie Authors, who knew, and the amount of savings I have had and 3 times the books. The wireless download is great and I love that I can read without my reading glasses by upping the font. If you are or know a reader, then this is the best device out there. I received mine as a gift, but would not hesitate to buy another for my Hubby. Amazon has nailed it and I plan on being a customer for a long time."
1,Corporate Controlled Delivery Device,"Two things - I'm sure you're all familiar with how Amazon will take books you *thought* you owned and yank them off your Kindle whenever they want to. They refund your money - but that's not the point. If you bought a paper book, this would be a non-starter.Item #2 - I'd mostly use this as an aggregated collection of my reference works - but I already own 95% of the reference books I'd want on the kindle (HTML lookup, JavaScript references, web language references, CSS references, etc.) If I could send in my books and pay a nominal ($2? $5?) fee to get the electronic equivalents, that'd be great. However, that option doesn't exist, and who is to say O'Reilly won't yank all my licensed reference books on a whim? (about 50% of my stuff is O'Reilly).Let me know when the Kindle becomes a consumer-friendly device I can trust - right now it kind of reminds me of the CDs that shipped with anti-RIPping technology - another thing Amazon refused to disclose."
1,DRM (when everyone else has ditched it),"If I go to a bookstore and buy a book, it's mine.If I go to Amazon & buy an e-book it's theirs.I was VERY seriously considering buying a Kindle until they withdrew books that people had paid for. Imagine Sunday afternoon, my son goes to complete his school project on a famous book, turns on the Kindle and its not there.Now I know it's crippled by DRM (when everyone else has ditched it) why should I throw my money away?"
1,"Yes, It Matters","It is rare for me to deliver a one-star review solely on principle, but Amazon has set an incredibly dangerous precedent in developing the functionality to delete ""owned"" e-books after a purchase has been made.To quote Slate.com and Harvard law professor Jonathan Zittrain:""Amazon deleted books that were already available in print, but in our paperless future -- when all books exist as files on servers -- courts would have the power to make works vanish completely. Imagine a world in which all copies of once-censored books like Candide, The Call of the Wild, and Ulysses had been permanently destroyed at the time of the censoring and could not be studied or enjoyed after subsequent decision-makers lifted the ban.""I'm hoping that future versions of the Kindle (and the iPhone!) don't have this feature."
1,Not Happy - False Advertising,"I was given a kindle as a christmas present, of which I knew nothing about. Went about setting it up and charging etc and low and behold I find that all the books that I would like to read (download) are not available in Australia. The search facility in the bookstore is very hit and miss. You find a book that looks like it might be a good read and guess what, it's not downloadable in Australia. Doesn't seem to do a consistant author or book search."
5,Kindle 2,"A very unique product. A bit hard to get used to with out specific directions that I understand were included witht he first Kindle & not incuded with the second edition, but I'm plugging along, as long as I can get my books, I'm okay I guess, & since I finally found your support #."
4,new kindle,"I really enjoy using my new kindle; much easier than holding a book while lying in bed and reading. It is very easy to add items to the library, and the print is quite clear even in bright light. The only down side is that the ""click"" sound when advancing the page is annoying to those close by."
5,Avid readers should have this!,I have had my kindle for a bit over a year now and absolutely love it! Books download quickly and ebook selection is great! I read every night before I go to bed...so convenient and easy to use! You cannot go wrong owning one of these items.
5,Loving my Kindle,"I just received my Kindle and downloaded my 1st book. Text is so easy to read. I seem to read much faster with the Kindle. (I can see the text much better than a book)I recommend this for anyone who loves to read.Kindle 3G Wireless Reading Device, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 3G Works Globally, Graphite, 6"" Display with New E Ink Pearl TechnologyIt gets 5 stars from me. I also bought the leather case with the reading light. A great protector for your Kindle."
3,One Major Flaw,"I just got a Kindle for Christmas and am adapting to reading on an e-book much more easily that I thought. It has many great features, but has one important drawback that may cause me to exchange it for a NOOK. It will not accept e-books from the NYPL, my locaL upstate library or my college library. In each case , e-books can be loaned to a Nook or the SONY e-reader. I don't mind buying some books, but I read a lot of fiction which could become an economic disadvantage. If you want to download books from your local library, check before buying the Kindle."
4,Kindle review,I love my kindle and take it everywhere I go. The downloads are cheap and easy. I think the only thing I do not like is the on and off switch. Sometimes it refuses to turn off and I just get frustrated with it.
5,Newspapers - Delivered without going outside,"I read a few newspapers. I 1st got them delivered but hate folding newspapers. Then I read them online which is not convenient, not always near a computer. I like to read my papers on the couch.But now I have the Kindle 2!!! Greatest device for reading the news. Not too many pictures, but I don't mind that. Battery life is great. Easy to pick up where I left off. Easy to browse the news and select the articles I want to read.I love it."
5,2nd Generation Works,"I waited for the 2.0 version expecting Amazon to make many improvements. It was worth it. The hardware is much improved. It's easy to use, fits in my hand and after a while feels like a book.Here is my quick take on various elements:Price - little too high but I wanted one!Design - very good! Should include the cover but the one they offer works. Big improvement over 1.0 cover.Screen navigation is easy with a little practice. Already wonder about ease of organizing things as I accumulate more books.Experimental stuff - not sure yet. A little slow and awkward.Oxford Dictionary - this is great to quickly look up words as you read.Book selections good but want more access to recent releases by favorite authors.Terrific travel companion! Easy to download quick versions of the stuff I normally read without paying for the full edition. This could be a fight with my wife on who gets to use it.Overall this is a great device. I look forward to new generations!"
4,Totally Amazed at Kindle's Capabilities,"I was on a Fall Foliage bus trip to New England and one of the members had a Kindle. I had seen the ads on Amazon but after actuallly holding one in my hand, knew this was for me. I have been enjoying my Kindle for approximately a month and everyday I discover something to ""brag"" about to my friends. I am especially impressed that it remembers where I closed the book and returns me to that page. I am still a beginner and have a lot to learn but am looking forward to the fabulous opportunities that Kindle presents. I recommend it for all ages and all professions."
5,The BEST warranty!,"My Mother-In-Law (78) recieved a Kindle for her birthday, and loves it. Just the other day, it slipped out of her hands and the screen is now damaged. We did not buy the extra warranty. However, when I called customer service I was shocked to hear they would Next Day Air out a new one to her today!! Because it is still under the 1 year warranty.Great, great, GREAT warranty service!!! Thank you!"
5,Don't leave home without it,"I love my Kindle. I take it everywhere - very portable, easy to read, easy to use - keeps me entertained.Although not all books from Amazon are in the Kindle format. You can request the publisher to allow Amazon to put it into Kindle format, but it takes a long time and many requests. That's the only downside. But there are lots of Kindle books to choose from and a lot of them are free.Happy reading."
3,Kindle e-reader,"Once I got the Kindle going, it was great, I really liked it. However, within a week, Kindle ""died"". It won't start, reset or charge, customer service said it was a dead battery, and a replacement Kindle was order.The replacement came the next day and it has been working like a charm and I absolutely love it. I've been able to download books everywhere I go with the global wireless system. To be able to increase the font size means I do not have to go in search of my glasses when I want to read. :)The only minor annoyance is that Amazon kept wanted to charge me for free books that I have downloaded a month later. They do refund the cost, but it's annoying that I have to call them every month to have the charge removed. Take note Amazon."
5,AWESOME PRESENT,I bought the Kindle for my Mom for Christmas. It was such a big hit. She had no idea what it was or that this even existed. She has not put it down. She has learned to navigate it well. All of her favorite authors are on Amazon. She is an avid reader and always has been. Thank you! I was the hit of our Christmas Party
5,Love this device!,"I love to read, but the Kindle has made me love it more. I love being able to pre-view books before I purchase them too. What a great invention!"
1,so close... but no,"Was one click away from buying, but than found out that most books have the read-to-me disabled. The read-to-me feature (I can be lazy sometimes and just want to listen) was making it so I could over look the DRM thing. I will just keep on buying the books that way I know I own them and can do what ever I want with them. And as far as text-to-speech, well you can find just about anything for free on the net. Way to lose out on my money publishers."
4,Chilean Customer,"So far so good..I received it in Chile 1 month ago already and I love this invention.It has made my travels a lot shorter since you can use your kindle anywhere you are. The battery life is great(I think I just charged it a couple of times during this first month)3G network connection works perfect in Chile. The only complaint I have is that some content of the kindle store is not available for south america (maybe more than some...a lot!). No free kindle books for Chile either. I don't know the reason, but I feel very dissapointed and discriminated abut it.Sooo not 5 stars, just 4 because of that."
3,Kindle Review,I love this Kindle but I wish the screen was lighted. This would make for easier viewing at night!
4,amazon kindle review,needs a light (back light)many books are not available on audiocan not access library sources
5,Kindle,This was given to me as a gift. It is an amazing product with good quality viewing screen. It's very lightweight and easy to manage. The option of listening and/or reading alone is great.
3,Fragility an issue,"I bought this for my 13 year old daughter who really likes to read. I got it in the mail and tried it out myself a little and liked it. However, I kept reading reviews and became concerned about the fragility. More than a few reported that even a small drop could break the screen. I knew that NOT dropping it wasn't going to happen so reluctantly I sent it back. I will get one when it can survive 'normal' clumsiness."
3,Future Kindle,"I bought a Kindle 2, and had to return it for the reason that it cannot zoom in PDF documents and cannot show pages numbers of books for reference. Simply speaking, it is not designed for academic readers. I just want to emphasize that there are many users like me who want to use kindle to READ, instead of using it as another computer. The e-ink technology is what makes Kindle special, and future Kindles should improve its features for READING different documents, taking notes and filing documents, instead of imitating computer functions and losing its own advantage."
3,Difficult to figure out what is going on,"I have had many problems getting this to download from my area because of no signal or low signal. I have tried to download on computer but sometimes it does not work. And I have somehow pushed wrong button and deleted novel, took quite a while to get it figured out and back on. then when you do something wrong it is difficult to get back to page you were reading. Maybe after many tries I will be able to use it better but the cost of books is kind of high for most books and finding my favorite authors is not easy on your website."
1,Slim line stuff that doesn't work,Bought it for my wife in December. Managed a few downloads (very weak signal with the wireless router despite it being less than a metre away) and then it gave up connecting altogether.Anticipating the sheer joy of sending it back from the UK to the US and waiting for another one....
1,Beware Kindle Buyers,"Shame on you, Amazon! I bought a Kindle 1, just over a year ago and it stopped working. Amazon said I could pay $50 for a refurbished model. No special deal on buying the new, ""substantially upgraded"" one that Amazon is now touting. Sad to spend this kind of money ($350 for the original) and have Amazon NOT stand behind their products. Rude customer service manager spoke to me as if I should have expected the product to fail after one year. Gonna wait for the iPad. :-("
5,I love my Kindle,I received my Kindle for Mother's Day - it was one of my best gifts ever. I am able to enjoy reading without having to juggle books in my bag (I normally read two books at a time). I recommend that you get one.
5,Fantastic,"I am amazed how easy the kindle has made my life. Within 30 seconds i have the book i want and can sit and read it at my leisure. No more hunting book stores or waiting on deliveries. It arrived within 3 days from Amazon, and since i am in another country was very impressed by their service.I would recommend a Kindle to everyone and have done so to my friends be it as a gift or something for yourself you won't regret it.Yours sincerelyLeonie Rios"
1,Loved it but no coverage,"We bought for our folks for Christmas because they were desperate for daily national newspapers. It worked great in Tampa over Christmas. But sadly, when they returned home to south central South Carolina, they had Zero coverage. They live in an area of South Carolina that supposedly has AT&T 3G coverage but no-go said the Amazon/Kindle customer service rep from somewhere in South America. The service rep told our folks that they could spend an hour every morning and download to their computer then transfer it over to the Kindle. ""Kind of defeats the purpose of waking up and having coffee with the morning paper,"" said my folks but the statement was lost in the translation."
1,Doesn't ship two-day like the Kindle 1 did,"How do customers actually review the item prior to the 24th if it only launches today?Sorry if this review isn't helpful because I don't yet have the product. It's really more of a warning.I am a happy Kindle 1 owner who was invited to ""buy"" the Kindle 2 (no discount, just priorty pre-order opportunity). I pre-ordered it and it shipped on the 22nd - but USPS ground (e.g., the ""slow boat""). Why? Amazon says because I am not a Prime member.I thought that all Kindles were shipping with free two-day. Not so - Amazon is just using deceptive banners for Prime. Isn't Amazon trying to own the e-book market with the Kindle. I thought the were doing a bang-up job, but the customer service is just not good enough to support it.Beware of the bullying to buy into the Prime program. And I'll tell you about the Kindle 2 if and when it actually arrives."
1,"Yes, I'm a dinosaur","I not only like the feel of books and paper better than metal, but I also like to highlight and add tabs so I can go back to my books and quickly find that phrase that really struck a cord with me.Until the Kindle -- no strike that -- a machine will never replace the joy of reading a book for me. So?"
5,Kindle 2 fulfills a reading experience,"I am a first time user of Kindle device. I have utilized my PDA/ computer as an electronic reader in the past. Kindle 2 is a well design product and fulfills the basic intention of a reading experience and more. Although available technology offers touch color screen, storage card slot, music/video program, etc., these items would distract from the main focus of a good reading experience. I enjoy reading with Kindle 2. The beauty of this device is its clear intention of offering a simple reading experience."
1,Too Fragile - Don't Buy!!!!!,"I've owned my Kindle for less than 2 weeks when it was dropped in the cover, less than a 2 feet fall. You guessed it - it's damaged and Amazon states it wants $200.00 to replace it. That would mean I'll have paid $559 for something that's not made worth the $359.00. It's not strudy at all. I own laptops, phones, gps and I'm not a careless person and everyone can experience an accident, however, this product stipulates no accicidents! It's a great idea, but they haven't built it to last."
1,Low contrast screen a real dealbreaker,"the Kindle 2 has low contrast. The screen background is very dark. Why the background is gray and not white is puzzling to me. The text is also not black, but light black. To me it looks like gray on gray and is completely not acceptable. I was further shocked to find that there is no way to adjust the contrast. That is really messed up. BTW, those nice photos on the right side of the product description page is NOT what it looks like. Those are not honest photos. When I read a piece of paper, I'm reading black on white, and that is easy for my 40+ year old eyes. I could never use a K2, as this issue is to bothersome. The low contrast is shockingly bad. What were they thinking?"
1,Kindle,"I find the idea of the Kindle (and now Kindle 2) to be an excellent one. With a capability to store around 1,500 books on one device is certainly a space saver, and is a blessing if you move often :-).I still cannot get my head around the price of the device though. They started at $399, and you can find them now advertised for $359. I still think this is a bit steep for a device that merely downloads and digitally displays textual material for reading. Mini computers sell for this much too. If Kindles would suddenly go on sale for $150 I would probably buy one the next day, but in the meantime I'll just order my books the old fashioned way :-)."
1,##### THIS PRODUCT IS HORRIBLE ######## DO NOT BUY,"I really hate this product , the Screen is sub-par the wireless rarely works and books opens really slow ... there are much better readers like Sony and Barnes & Noble ... do yourself a favour don't buy this at all ... I just hate it but am stuck with it.##### DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT ###########"
2,Potential Buyer Waiting For Next Version,"I was ready to order the Kindle 2 as a gift for someone who reads a lot of books until I read the 2&3 star reviews. There are problems with this product that do not justify spending close to or more than $400. Sounds like the next version better correct the problems before Sony finds a way to solve its own problem with its reader. I would like to see Amazon be the market leader; but, if it does not get better reviews, the Kindle will become just like GM products have vs Honda etc.Andrew in Lompoc CA"
2,A Disappointment,"Just prior to Christmas, I bought Kindle 1; Two months later Kindle 2 is on the market. Evidently, there is no discount for trading in Kindle 1 for the upgrade Kindle 2. Why no discount and why was I not told in December that an upgrade was due out in two months?Bill Braun"
1,Question for Kindle2 users,Can any of you Kindle users tell me if you are able to download textbooks?
1,No more books!,"This is great! No more books! No more pretty covers, no more beautiful book shelves, just pure black and white digital . . . hey . . . wait a minute . . . :("
1,2nd Kindle broken - screen went out on both of them just after the warranty ended,"I've had 2 Kindles. The first one, the screen all of a sudden turned into an etch-a-sketch board and was not able to be fixed and yesterday the 2nd one did too. Has anyone had their screen bomb out on them like this???"
2,Beware the inadequate warranty,"Much as we like the reading quality on the Kindle, it is much too fragile and Amazon's inadequate warranty offers no relief. Our Kindle fell off a step stool on to carpet -- a pretty minor ""bump"". Thereafter, the screen was about 1/3 unreadable. When we checked with Amazon, we were told that they would replace the unit for $200 -- more than 1/2 its cost -- despite having been received only two months earlier.We have subjected personal computers, GPSs, cell phones, Blackberrys, etc. to much tougher falls and no damage has resulted. The Kindle is just too fragile....and, given that, Amazon should improve its warranty."
2,Not happy,"I have had Amazon send me a second Kindle, a replacement for the first one, as it would not hold a charge for more than 3 hours. I am finding the same issue with the second one. I also live in the country and am having an issue accessing the Whispernet in order to download items. We no longer get a daily newspaper and that was the primary reason for buying a Kindle but I cannot download it unless I go to town, a 30 minute drive. I am not happy with the Kindle, even though I do like the concept."
2,Not that great for periodicals.,"Length:: 2:57 MinsThe Kindle seems to have a lot of good features, like long battery life, and the free download wireless connection, however, those benefits don't offset the practical experience of how I've read a newspaper and collect my news. I'd rather read it on a web page format, than scroll through all the articles. With so many various tools available to the end user today, including Zinio for Magazines, and audio books, I can't see this being the future of how I might choose to receive my reading material."
3,Love Hate relationship,"My reviews are generally short and sweet, or sour depending on the product. This is sort of in between.Here are the loves. It reads to me, it is light weight, it can hold many books. I can take it anywhere. I can do a task with my hands while listening to the kindle 2 and then when I can read I can switch it off and read.Here are the hates. It does not have a back light so you can not read in the dark,(I mean really Amazon ... Even my watch in the 80's had a back light!!!!) the text to speech is not so great, very digital sounding. My GPS has better speech. Even in the best light it is difficult to see images in the books. It is not in color. It is over priced and does not come with full instructions, you have to pay for that separately. (called a cook book)I guess some of these will be in the kindle 3."
2,not the advertised display,"Don't expect the crisp black-and-white, just-like-the-printed-page display that is advertised. It's actually a dull gray--easy enough to read in strong light, but definitely takes some getting used to. I've had the kindle 2 for about a week now, and still find myself wishing it could be brighter and crisper."
1,Kindle is not durable at all...........,I fell asleep reading my Kindle book. Common? Probably. Rolled over on my kindle and the screen is ruined. Only two months old. Amazon said no coverage. They will replace it for $200 but why would you want something so sensitive?
1,"Buying this is a colossally ""disadvantageous contract""!!!","Purchasing this can best be summed up by the Brehon legal term ""dochor"", or ""disadvantageous contract"". Being scammed into surrending your property rights to a corporation with nothing in return is the height of ignorance. Doing so leads to a slippery slope in which the user surrenders all her digital rights. There are plenty of lies people parrot that encourage this, such as ""if you're not doing anything wrong, then why should you care"". By that reasoning, all state secrets should be divulged anon. Be sure to keep yourself on an equal footing and do not harm your own condition by giving away your rights. Do not buy this device, buy a different device. Only by standing up for your rights will they be respected."
4,very cool,"I really like my Kindle. Ordering your e-books is easy as pie. Accidentally order a title, getting a refund is also just as easy. I sampled a few books before purchasing. I think there needs to be a delete sample button on the Kindle itself rather than trying to delete it from the data folder. All in all I enjoy reading via the Kindle. The display is darker than I anticipated. I guess I thought it (the paper substitute) would be whiter or creamier in that there isn't a back-light. I guess I thought there would be page numbers rather than locations. I do like the fact that the Kindle keeps track of where you are do you don't lose your place.That's about it. I bought it for ease of use in traveling; I will no longer have to lug my paperbacks with me on vacation."
5,Best Purchase I Have Made in Years,"If you read newspapers and magazines this product is the way to go. Books are good too, but I like to keep up with events. It is so much cheaper not to mention a greener alternative to paper.This is without a doubt one of the best purchases made in years."
2,5-way button is impossible!,"I was very frustrated by the tiny, tiny little 5-way button on the 6"" Kindle. It is extremely hard to use when I could get it to work, and someone w/ arthritis in their fingers (like my poor mom) cannot use it at all."
1,Not for Canadians,Bought the Kindle 6 weeks ago. I live in Canada. First thing I learned with my Kindle is that it is a lousy product in Canada. Many of its features are disabled. Prices of the e-books are much higher in Canada. My Kindle died after5 weeks. Got a replacement under warranty. Would have liked to have purchased an extended warranty but only available for American residents. Canadians should avoid this Kindle piece of garbage.
1,Not for technologically challenged people,"I bought this for my husband as a Christmas, against my better judgement. I just had to deregister it in order to keep him from inadvertently ordering a book when he thought he was just reading a synopsis. Amazon needs to create another way to order a book that does not include 1-click. If they are lucky, I will not include this piece of junk in the next garbage pickup. I hate it."
5,Kindle purchase,I purchased the Kindle for my husband for father's day.He is very happy with the kindle although I must say that I am using it as much as he is.I would make one recommendation however for the next version and that is to add backlighting to the page.I plan to purchase the light and the leather cover for our Kindle.We love it.
5,Love My Kindle 2,I did not know that the Kindle reader existed until a co worker of mine brought hers to work and introduced me to it. I knew right away I had to have one. I do some travel and I liked the idea that I can basically take multiple books to read without the weight of carrying the actual books. I also like the fact that I can buy them while on the road electronically or even order the free books offered by Amazon. It's just a great product. It very user friendly. I have no complaints about my Kindle. I am 100% a Kindle girl and would recommend it to anyone!
3,Best Seller Availability,"I just checked off Sunday's list of the New York Times Bestsellers. Out of 20 books, 3 were not available on Kindle. My ratio is worse. Out of the last ten books I wanted to download, four to five of them were not available. I truly LOVE my Kindle, but I don't enjoy carrying it and printed copy when I travel....sort of defeats the purpose. I'm asked about my Kindle often and I have started telling people to wait and check out the competition before they commit to Amazon."
4,Kindle,"A superb product by and large. So superior to other devices ( ie Sony Reader) in its downloading ability.Within a few seconds of buying a new book voila it is on my Kindle. No computer needed, no fuss.I love the clear (read in sunlight if you wish) text, and text to speech can be very useful when drifting off to sleep.Two changes I would make:1. The Home menu is cluttered, and would benefit from sub-menus2. I am annoyed that any earphones I use do not fit properly in the socket, such that getting sound is very fiddly, and stereo impossible. This gripe drops one star.Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)"
4,Kindle,"The kindle is great - I travel a lot and usually read at least 6 books or more when traveling. Having the Kindle makes this so much easier. I can read what I want, when I want, where ever I want. I love it."
4,Wave of the future..,I love my Kindle 2. I got it for my birthday and I really have been enjoying it. I would suggest a few enhancements for the next version like an attachable LED light designed with the Kindle 3. I would also suggest a center next page button for easier 1 handed using. Over all this is an awesome product and I would tell anyone to rush out and buy one. I did find an awesome light that slides into the 3.5mm jack on the top beside the on-off switch. It is a great accessory. A must for any Kindle owner.http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item;=150329796735&ru;=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.ebay.com%3A80%2F%3F_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dm38%26_nkw%3D%2B150329796735%26_sacat%3DSee-All-Categories%26_fvi%3D1&_rdc=1
4,Kindle convert,"I had doubts when I first saw the Kindle, but now I love it. I have some eye probvlems and the Kindle has alowed me to read comfortably again. I highly recommend it."
5,quick fix,"it arrived, two weeks later it crapped out on me, called Amazon, replacement arrived the next day, couldn't have been easier. ok, you could say, it should have had more staying power, but epaper is still in its early days.so what i REALLY like about it is (1) the sense i'm always in touch, online. i don't use a cellphone, so when i travel--including Mexico, where i live part time, i can just about check email for any emergency; (2) i download a lot of articles for reading later (i'm a science writer), so i save as text in the docs folder on my kindle, and catch up reading them anytime, anywhere. love it.i tried the original kindle, sent it back (main issue, well known to anyone who had one, the crazy way you'd touch it and the page would turn--poor design of side switches), also a bit bulky. this time, kindle 2, they got it right. price ($259) is right, too, considering i've paid for eternal online service."
3,internatonal not working internationally!,"Kindle is great, but beware that the coverage map does not reflect reality. Kindle International is not functioning well in some countries where it should be functioning. The whispernet is not available. Therefore you have no access to Kindle store via your Kindle. Amazon says they are working on it, but for $250+ you expect them to have it working."
4,Amazing Kindle,"Kindle is something that happened to me by chance. I have never seen this product before until my client CEO showed it to me. That was the turning point. Amazon would have increased its sales manyfold had they been able to physically demo it in malls, etc. Big mistake!I also love the service quality of Amazon. Quite a fan really. The only thing missing in Kindle is the availability of a print option for some pages of the book just as we do with physical books. Perhaps Amazon should being in this feature: Either one can scan and use charts and some pages in a book to be converted into pdf and use for sending colleagues or friends."
4,"Product is great, service is great!!","I was fully attracted by Kindle's appearance when it was taken out from the courier package. It is easy to operate, text display is sharp and excellent for reading. Its battery is very long running(it can almost be used up to 2 weeks if I turn off the wireless). With its compact size, I can enjoy reading any place, anytime. I actually read more books after I purchased it. Amazon's good customer services is one of my appreciation. It seems prefect except the followings:- Maganize reading is limited and no good. (lack of picture and poor format..)- No support in Chinese/Asian language (and no co-operation with Chinese book publishers)However, I still highly recommend it to anybody who likes reading... I give it 4 stars plus rating..James"
2,Reliability issues are a major problem,"I'm on my 3rd Kindle in under a year. The first had a software lockup at about 9 months that couldn't be resolved. The second has a screen failure after about 2 months. Amazon has replaced both Kindles free of charge, but my year warranty is almost up and I'm not looking forward to the next failure. (By the way, Amazon says each replacement is warranted for 3 months).I love the convenience, but I can't say anything good about reliability. Amazon needs to either improve the product, or improve the warranty."
3,six inch kindle screen too small for technical manuals,"I just sent my Kindle back to Amazon for a refund. I loved certain features: quick download, an easy on the eyes font, search capability, etc. However, I purchased the Kindle mainly to read technical publications--the types of publications that have pictures, diagrams and formatted lists. The Kindle's six inch screen is too small to display a complete page and therefore graphic content which occupies a full page, or even most of a page, was often displayed in a less than ideal (sometimes, even less than a usable) fashion."
4,Kindle Reader,"I bought a Nook and was disappointed with the Font Size and need to charge the battery every day. My husband surprised me with a Kindle and I have been delighted with it, although I do miss the color pictures in Nook (even though I realize they are part of the battery problem.) I am visually impaired and the the large font size has allowed me to read again. I would have liked a smidgen more font size but when the largest size doesn't work, I can listen to lots of books. I only have two other disappointments. It seems like the next page feature should be at the bottom of the Kindle not half way up. Also, the larger font size only affects the books, not the Kindle Shop. I don't understand why the large font isn't avaiable when shopping.f"
5,kindle,"Love it! I love paperbacks, BUT, this is lighter, takes up much less room while travelling, AND, I can make the print nice and large. Only suggest to Kindle is to make the power on and off button on tip easier to manipulate, access, move."
5,Kindle me Happy!,I love this Kindle its amazing the only drawback to it is that there is no backlight so if its dark i have to have a lamp to read
1,Censorship on Kindle,"I had thought that kindle would be a great thing to have but now that I realize that Amazon can censor my reading with the click of a mouse i would not dare to buy one. If our fredom to read what we want when we want to is diminished and eventually eliminated then what does America stand for!! My opinion don't buy a kindle, buy books instead!!"
2,kindle review,"I was very happy when i got the news for kindle 2. I think it is very good for who only get their books from Amazon. Apparently, people like me who have many many pdf files on my PC that I want to add to my kindle to read, cannot use this. Since I cannot directly load my files to kindle from my PC, without them , first going to the Kindle translator site to get formatted and then sent, and some require costs...etc...etc.Even if free, I do not want my private pdf documents and files or books get anywhere else. So this is not a good choice for people who are not dedicated to only purchase from Amazon. And have many strings attached...In time.I wish we could have direct pc to kindle link and download our purchased books on our PC, to actually own it."
1,Kindle is lame.,"Kindle is lame... Why you say, storing books digitally is a real drag. You have nothing tangible but an electric device. Not for me. I like bookshelves filled with books, not files that I cannot see.Until Kindle is updated with that new, or old book smell and is bundled with grips the texture of paper, and real tangible books are no longer for sale(God forbid) then I will be buying real books made out of pulp."
2,Use caution before buying a kindle,"I don't own a kindle 2, yet. I would caution anyone who is interested in buying one to do your research so you aren't disappointed. I think the technology of the kindle is great but I'm disappointed that the battery can't be changed on your own. You have to send it to the Amazon factory and pay 59.00 plus shipping to have them replace it. This means that you will be without your kindle for 1 - 2 months. It would be easier if you could change out the rechargeable battery yourself. There are plenty of e-books out there and the technology is improving all the time so I'll wait and see before I purchase a kindle."
3,Book prices,"I love the idea of an electronic library, I already have a paper one at home, the main and HUGE drawback to me is the price of the electronic books, when the prices are quoted they are given for hardback not paperback, which most people read and the price of some $9 is MORE than a paperback will cost, so until there is a more realistic pricing policy I will have to stick with paper, that I can afford."
2,Would have rated 5 stars except for DRM and Writers Guild decision,"The Kindle 2 corrects all of the hardware issues that were so prominent in the original version. It works and it works well.However, we all need to be aware that the DRM added to these ""books"" makes them unusable except by the buyer and except on a Kindle. We can't sell them or lend them unless we lend the hardware as well as the file. This new world that Bezos and Amazon are building is going to trample on the end-users' rights like nothing has before.The decision to cave to the Writer's Guild on the text-to-speech is both a form of ""bait-and-switch"" selling and an indication that end-users are secondary to Bezos' plans.Furthermore, the lack of a user changeable battery is bad engineering.Think carefully before buying into this concept of reading."
3,Love using my Kindle but the connection speed and reliability has something to be desired,"I love using my new Kindle, it's lightweight design makes it a perfect travel companion. The connection issues are aggravating though. It's spotty at best with all bars indicating that I am receiving the strongest signal. It many times fails to hook up and I get a message that ""I should try again later"" The 60 second downloads that are advertised have not occurred for me as of yet."
4,cathymac,"I in love with thing, I carry it with me all the time.If you love to read this a wonderful companion. Every day I learn something new about it's versatility."
4,Kindle 2- Excellent of kind,I recently purchased a new Kindle 2. So far it has worked quite well. Even the robot reading function is accepteable and useful when I am interested in continuing a book and have to drive or engage in other activity where I can't read- I can still listen. I am still checking out the experimental stuff and so far whenever I pick a website from the preset ones I can't get back to make a different selection without resetting the entire Kindle 2. I am still learning and will have more to report after taking it on a 30 day cruise -- and leaving behind the weight of many books.
4,Kindle,"I love this device, the only thing that I would like better is if it lit up for night reading"
1,People who rated Kindle 5 stars must not of had Kindle for over a year,"The Kindle breaks easily!! If you do not have an extended warranty, you will just hear, ""Sorry we can not do anything to help you. Your warranty has expired."" They should just have an automated recording that repeats those two sentences because that is all I heared. Customer service either doesn't listen or doesn't understand English. I feel like I have been scammed and will NEVER buy from Amazon again.Just weird to me that Kindles cannot be fixed; they can only be replaced. Why does it have to be all or nothing? Either way, without the warranty you get nothing!!! Still sick to my stomach that I wasted so much money and have nothing to show for it after a year."
2,Low Contrast Surrounded by Bright Border,"I wish the contrast between the text and screen background were better, and that the dark grey screen were not surrounded by a bright off-white border, which creates a distraction making reading that much less enjoyable. I returned the device but will be on the lookout for a subsequent version that solves these problems, and no doubt will be one of the first customers for it."
4,"Kindle 6""","I love the product - Functionality is good, sometimes internet connection is a little slow- it would be good to have back light for night reading since similar products at the same price point have this feature. It would also be good if you could automatically archive books as apposed to having them all on home page. Voice and sound quality is good but sometimes not well read."
3,Good device but still to improve,It's pretty easy to use as ebook reader but i think still to improve as mp3 player.
5,Great item,"Had the Kindle for about 3 weeks now. I have never read so many books in such a short period of time. I have read at least 5 books,, 3 of which were novels, 1 (long) short story and 1 long narrative. I love it, it is easy to download and is great fun."
5,The best eBook on the Market!,"I recently purchased a Kindle. I have to say the device exceeded my expectations. There isn't a huge number of devices on the market in Australia and the Kindle is by far the most superior available.The Kindle is easy to use, has text to speech functionality (making learning a new language that much easier) and the wireless access to amazon.com is surprisingly fast. You are also able to load any ebooks that you may have already stored on your computer onto your Kindle.In addition, the buttons/keys for the Kindle are sterdy (unlike other devices on the market where the buttons need to be pushed hard and the device feels like it will fall apart when this is done).I would highly recommend purchasing the Kindle!"
5,Reading more than ever!,My kindle has made reading so convenient that I read a book a week! I've had to alternate between free and not-so-free because I was spending so much! Best birthday present ever...thanks hubby!!!
4,Kindle Reading Device,"I purchased the Kindle for my wife who reads a lot of Christian fiction. We took it on vacation to help avoid weight on our luggage and carryon items. She is really enjoying the device. She read two books and ordered another, it rained a lot. She is very satisfied. The only problem is reading a Bible. One cannot see chapter and verse. And no notes at the bottom of a page, so we have not put our Bibles on the device.We are looking forward to learning more functions on the device. We are both over 60 and not technological so the Kindle is easy to use.Jim Farley"
5,My 78 year old dad is so happy,I gave the Kindle to my dad so he wouldn't have to carry around books when he travels. He is so pleased and comments on it often.
1,Defective by design,"Be careful when you buy this, you are not really buying a reader, but a subscription to a service, which if Amazon decides to cancel, will leave you with a big brick. This also includes the books you buy, you don't BUY them you RENT them, so Amazon can decide when to take them away from you. Google George Orwell + Kindle, to see what happened to so many people when Amazon decided to delete this book remotely through there Kindle, not to mention other's who's Amazon account was cancelled, leaving there kindle useless(all book's and device unusable)...so think again what 400 buys you."
1,No Kindle for me,"Now that we know Amazon can manipulate your Kindle in any way it sees fit, why would anyone want to get one? It turns out you only rent the ebooks for the Kindle, and if Amazon decides to change the rental period, tough.No Kindle for me. Not as long as DRM exists."
5,Kindle much better than IPAD,"I purchased a Kindle and a new IPAD to see which one I would prefer!!! The KINDLE won!! Sent the IPAD back after one day... The kindle is light, the e-ink is awesome and does not strain my eyes. The ipad was heavy in my arms, I cannot imagine holding that for an extended period of time while reading. I was not fond of reading with a backlit screen on the ipad and it was difficult to read outside. The KINDLE is great even in bright sunlight and is so light compared to the ipad. Absolutely love the Kindle 3G!"
4,My new best friend,"I read. A lot. And I take a book with me pretty much everywhere I go. The Kindle makes this much easier, and I can take SEVERAL books wherever I go! My Kindle has been to the beach, to the mountains, and to the pool. I got a lovely pouch for it on Etsy, so it's protected from scratches and drops (yeah, it's been dropped a few times, but no problems).As long as the wireless is turned off, the battery lasts for weeks. The wireless eats it up faster, but only turn it on to download books.I suppose this would be better if it had a touch screen, and you didn't have to scroll with the menu button to highlight or access the dictionary. But if you really want that, get an iPad. If you only want a great reader (book replacement), at a great price, the Kindle is the way to go!"
1,Customers outside U. S. BEWARE,I am rating one star for the following reason: I live in Puerto Rico and recently purchased the Kindle Global Wireless. I was hoping to start purchasing my favorite titles before the arrival of my kindle device only to find out that not all kindle editions of my favorite books are available to all countries. I wrote an email to amazon.com customer support about this issue and was told that I would have to contact the publishers of a book of my interest and request not only to make the title available in its kindle edition but also request availability for my country. What's the point of a GLOBAL wireless device if not all titles are available to all countries? This means that everytime a title pops into my mind I would have to cross my fingers and pray it will be available for purchase in my country. What a let down. I was hoping never to step into a bookstore again. I hope the Kindle Support Team addresses this issue PRONTO!!!
3,when do you use Kindle?,"I like the idea of Kindle but am wondering when people use it.I don't have a commute to the office but often travel - so could reviewers please give me an idea of when and why they use a Kindle over a paper book/magazine, which I read all the time."
1,Where can I get Whisper Net in order to work my Kindle 2?,I ordered a Kindle 2 last week and was so excited to show it to my book club where everyone is wanting one. I was never so disappointed when I found out that Whisper Net (the internet wireless service that the Kindle uses) is not available in my area (area code 76931). I live in a small resort community where people have money and who read. Where can I make a formal complaint about this? I understand that Sprint owns Whisper Net. Does anyone know if there is a way to use the Kindle any other way? The Kindle is worthless without having Whisper Net. You better check on this before you order one. Please help.
3,Technology Great - Book availability VERY LIMITED,"The Kindle2 does everything Amazon.com claims it does. Beware: the book availability is very, very limited right now. Newer/popular publications seem to be available, but at no significant savings. If you are thinking about saving money using this, it's a bad investment considering the cost of the hardware. If you're interested in the way it enables one to read and like the Best Sellers, this is definately for you.My recommendation for researchers and serious readers is to wait a year and see how Amazon.com builds their internal library."
4,Great Product,"I am a voracious book reader. I find the Kindle the answer to my needs. Of all the negative reviews I've read they all seem petty and nit picking. The Kindle is: easy to read, easy to operate, light weight, and very economical. I could easily spend $150.00 a month purchasing books at a discount center, never mind a book store. The price of $9.99 is extremely reasonable, some titles are free. If you take care of it, IE a cover, and don't throw it around you won't damage it. As with any purchase, If you take good care of it, it will take good care of you. If you read at night or on an aircraft, and do not want to disturb your bed or seat mate get a book light. They are available for less than $10.00. The only reason that I did not give a 5 star review is that you cannot download a book to a PC. The formatting is not compatible."
5,Kindle Review,"I wasn't sure how I would acclimate to reading the Kindle rather than a book. Surprisingly, I had no problem. I am an avid reader and have enjoyed the Kindle on a recent plane trip and especially having the Kindle with me while travelling, rather than two or three books. Also, I love knowing that I can order books or newspapers or magazines anytime, especially when I am away from home."
4,Kindle 2 Progress,"The Kindle1 was fantastic. Kindle2 advanced light years. There are still some imporvements awaiting. The ""search"" lacks muscle. Others have written well regarding other perfomance enhancements that will bring it out of the the very, very good e-reader to GREAAAT!"
4,Easy to use and wonderful to travel with!,"I love my new Kindle! It is easy to read on it and convenient for carrying with me everywhere! It is easy to download content. Battery life appears to be good with whispernet off.I am a little disappointed in the number of magazines available for downloading but there appears to be new content added all the time. The book list is awesome but somewhat difficult to navigate at times.It is easy to use right out of the box. Love the adjustable print - I can enlarge it while on the treadmill for easier reading. I was a little disappointed in the text to speech feature - no intonation, very flat, hard to understand.Overall, I love it and would recommend it to people who love to read!"
2,it's not a book,it's not a book and doesen't feel the least bit cozy. at $350+ I can buy an awful lot of books before I would ever feel I'd received my money's worth not to mention each book/magazine download costs nearly much as the physical item.Unless you travel extensively save your money & head to the library..
2,What credit card # is being used for subsequent purchases.???,I recently purchased the Kindle 2 for my wife's 60th birthday. She has already purchased a book. I just want to confirm what the credit card # is being used?
5,Reading Made Easy,"I love it! My wife keeps telling me she would rather have a book she can put on a shelf, but she keeps borrowing my Kindle. I wouldn't be surprised if we become a 2-Kindle family soon. It is especially handy while traveling. I don't have to lug a pile of books around the airport. I can purchase and download a book anywhere in less than 30 seconds. My daughter gave me a Kindle gift certificate recently. Man, it's even easier to spend money now. As I said before, I love it!"
1,Won't buy one,"Great idea but not as long as Amazon (or anyone else) plays the Big Brother role and retains the right to delete the books I have bought. It would be unthinkable for Barnes & Noble to come into my home and repossess a book I bought from them and I see no difference. Despite the recent scandal, Amazon retains the right to do so in their terms of service so I will wait for an enlightened competitor to come along with a similar product."
3,"if you like to hold books,this isn't for you","I was very excited when I read about this product.due to Diabetic retinopothy I need large print books.A lot of things i like to read are not in large print,so when I read about this I thought,problem solved.I was extremely disappointed in it.I only kept it 2 days and maybe didn't give it enough time to learn it.I originaly purchased a magazine and a book.I could not find a table of contents for the magazine and I did find one in the book but was not able to jump to another chapter from itI guess I'm a book person. a real book person, I like to flip through go back and forth checking facts or characters.I didn't like doing it on the kindle 2.It's not that intuitiveI have a bunch of other reasons but my main complaint is that it's not a book.I love booksI'm sure millions of people will love it,just not me"
2,Kindle Customer Service Poor Quality,"I just purchased a Kindle and am very excited to use it. Unfortunately my first experience with the Customer Service line was pretty horrible. The customer service guy just kept on repeating instructions without listening and then ended up hanging up on me. He was impatient and sounded like he really did not want to be helping in the least bit. I did end up figuring out the problem on my own but wow...it makes me wonder about value of the Kindle. I hope my experiences improve because, honestly, there are too many other competing products out there for me to waste my time on rude customer service."
5,Kindle,I just love the Amazon Kindle. I read alot of books and this is the best way ever. I can take it with me where ever I go. It's so easy to buy new or old books at the Kindle store.You can make the print smaller or larger depending on your reading prefrence.The pages in the book seem to read faster and the ease of turning the pages are Great.....
3,Book selection lacking!,"Very few if any of the popular titles are avalable. Out of the NY bestseller list, they only have one in kindle format. Wait till the selection improves."
2,Much better than Kindle?,"I had problems with my original Kindle freezing up and eventually the screen gave up while I was on vacation. (I had to buy more hard back books to read while on vacation.) Amazon replaced the Kindle with a Kindle, but I wish they had sent me the Kindle2 instead as I am concerned about the kindle stability. The old kindle is slow and was unstable. Is the new Kindle more stable?"
1,Stay away from the kindle!!,Protect your local economy and shop at your local bookstore!! The kindle does nothing to support your neighbors - SHOP LOCAL!!
1,I feel so sorry for myself with kindle,"oh, man. kindle seems to be great on ads, but suck in real. It is useless to me. Now it supports PDF file, but It doesnt work at all. if I have to send pdf file to somewhere, I dont know what would be with my stuff. I had better buy a small notebook (about $200) which supports most types of file. I just want to it put in the trash. It costs my time n energy for this stuff.Im sorry, but this is absolutely true."
5,Personal Traveling Library,"Because my husband and I travel overseas quite often, reading is a great way to pass those hours on the plane and for quiet times when in the foreign countries. We have taken up precious space and weight before with several heavy books in our luggage. Now we can just load up our Kindles (yes, he has one as well) with tons of books to read on our frequent trips. The convenience of changing the font to our older eyes is a plus as well. I could almost be a Kindle salesperson!"
5,Best reading device ever,"Best reading device ever and best device since psion revo :)Like it very much.Sadly, bu audiobooks by audible didn't work in my country."
5,Loved it,I was expecting an adaptation period for my switch from paper to e-book. I was pleasantly surprised by the seemless transition.
1,It has to be returned,"Hi,I have to return my kindle as it is not working properly. There is a dark stripe going down the middle of it and I can't read the writing and I will be sending it back to amazon.ThanksChristine Severtson"
1,Kindle,"Actually I gave the Kindle with applicance to my daughter for Christmas and she didn't want it so it has never been used and I wish I could return it but I didn't save the box and return slip, can you help me with this issue??? I would appreciate it, thank you, Sabine Pietri"
3,no reading lite,"My wife bought this for me as a xmas present, it is very light, the directions are difficult, as you have to turn item on and proceed through the instructions. For a tech person, not a problem, for a non tech person, cumbersome ,but not real difficult. The real problem I have is that there is no light for reading at night, or in low light areea, using a reading light with the kindle is difficult with the glae making you long for a book.So far I've been abl to download 50% of the books I ordered, the others are unavailable at this time. typical downloads have taken about 2-3 minutes in a medium reception areaAs all new items these problems will be ironed out, its a great idea, will help immensley when I travel as I always bring 3-5 books with me, the reading light is the biggest whoops I have encountered I would wait a year to buy, more older books wil then be available and hopefully, as most new tech toys, the price will go down.mahalo"
3,Great...except for PDF support.,"I love many things about this product, the feel, the screen, the paper I save, the amount of material I can store on it. However - and this is a big however for me - the PDF support is absolutely not up to par.The primary reason I bought this was to carry the large volume of material I have to read for work - largely scripts and manuscripts. When I sent them to the Kindle, the formatting was completely different and some of the characters were symbols, rendering it almost unreadable.In Amazon's defense, they do list this as an ""experimental feature."" But I feel a little misled nonetheless and would rather they had not advertised it as a function. This feature is clearly still very unrefined and problematic. If you are like me and want to carry your own material on Kindle, I would not recommend this product. Because the Kindle is not cheap, I returned it and will wait to see what competitors come up with or what the next generation is like."
4,Kindle 2,Corrects 90% of the design errors of the horribly designed Kindle 1I believe I will like Kindle 2 and be happy with it.
4,Thank you for reintroducing my love for reading!,"The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that there is sooo much that can be done with the Kendle, I had to purchase two other books to learn how to use all the features the Kendle has to offer. Shouldnt this information come with the Kendle? Its like buying a DVD player and having to buy the instruction manual to learn how to use it! Not right Amazon, you dropped the ball on that one but the product is excellent!"
5,Love my Kindle,"I recieved this as a birthday gift and it's by far one of the best gifts i've ever been given. I take my Kindle with me everywhere. I love being able to have many books with me without all the bulk of carrying them. I also love the text to speech function. Yes, it sounds slightly robotic and pronounces some words incorrectly but overall I love it. I listen to it when driving to work and back. You can't beat the prices of the books and i've discovered some books that I never would have had I not been searching the Kindle Book Store. The battery life is great and it has far more features than the B&N Nook which a friend of mine has. I have about twice the battery life and the time it takes for the page to turn is about half the time on the Kindle compared to the Nook. There are so many other things I could say about it but the bottom line is that i'm very happy and I highly recommend it."
3,Convenient Device,"The kindle has made reading more convenient. Two things that I really like: 1)reading materials download very quickly 2)device is light weight and saves space. I would recommend having the screen light up when in the dark, and have more Canadian content available to Canadian users. The buttons (i.e. Next, Previous, Back) can sometimes be annoying to press. Also, when I choose a category and go further to sub-category, the same choices from category popup. A sub-category should function as a advanced feature to narrow down your search and this does not happen. But overall, I'm happy with the device."
3,Gisele Brandt and battery problem,"I am pleased with my Kindle, but I am not satisfied with the fact that it runs out of battery very fast. I am also worried with the fact that several books that may be purchased through Amazon.com are not available at the Kindle bookstore."
4,Excellent,"The product is great, but ""global wireless"" is a bit misleading. I was in the UK and found that to download a book directly to my Kindle there was a $1.99 extra charge. I would think global wireless would be more...global."
2,No case? Wrong Decision Amazon,"The Kindle2 is a good product and provides a pleasurable reading experience. However, Amazon missed the mark by not including a protective case and not including a reading light. The light is understandable but the fact that I'm spending $350 on a device and wouldn't want to protect it makes no sense. Amazon should capitalize on the fact that electronics prices are consistently falling and they can include the case while maintaining the same profit margin or they can increase the price. But to force a consumer to purchase a case for an additional fee after including the case on the original Kindle is the wrong decision."
1,Kindle DX durability,"I bought the new Kindle and really loved it. Downloaded books and really got into carrying it with me. I bought the patagonia cover for it, but then accidently dropped it while in the case. Half the screen went totally unreadable and it no longer functioned plus it didn't reset. Called Amazon and because I dropped it, they said the 1 year warranty wouldn't cover it. Lesson learned is to buy the extended warranty. I am extremely disappointment that the new Kindle isn't more durable and able to survive dropping it...."
5,Great,"easy to use, screen is very easy on the eyes, it becomes so natural that once I tried to manually turn the page as though it was a real book. Excellent product!"
5,Great reader and space saver,"I absolutely love the Kindle. I have access to so many books for a much cheaper price and my books are not taking up any space on my already quite filled bookshelves. I can I can travel with it in my purse taking up much less space that my other books and far lighter. I can even download some books like classics for free, enter notes as I am reading and adjust the font size. It's a great device."
5,This thing is amazing!,"I finally got around to buying a Kindle. I had my doubts at first, that is until I bought my first book. It was amazing! When I was younger and more carefree, I used to love reading. I couldn't get enjoy books to read. Now that I'm older I find that I don't have much time. I have a bookshelf full of books but I haven't touched most of them in years. I needed something more convenient like my MP3 player. Having an entire collection at a click of a button is cool. Then I heard of this device. Needless to say, I'm glad Amazon made this device. Now I can renew my interest in reading. Thank you Amazon."
4,"Great, but can we brighten the screen?","I just got my Kindle, not having used the previous version. It's very cool. The only thing about it I'm not sure about is the brightness of the screen. Perhaps it will be easy on the eyes, but right now it feels like the ability to brighten the screen would be useful. But it is very sleek, easy to use, and arrived out of the box with the books I'd order already downloaded."
1,Can't use it!,Arrived password protected with no note letting me know what the password is so I could get into it to see if it even works! Was very dirty and nasty looking. I would not have rated it as good like the seller did. The least she could have done is clean it and the power cord and removed the password!!! Was one of the very first editions of the Kindle and so not worth the $68 I paid for it. Amazon was selling those for $25 when the Fire first came out. I bought it for a student who has been unable to learn to read due to a severe learning disability and it still sits unused because I can't get into it.
1,Very expensive for no color and mostly single use item -- get an iPad,"I think that given the fact that it doesn't have color, and is basically a single use item, that it is way to expensive!I know that I am going to get an iPad instead... I think it is a must more cost efficient purchase."
1,Don't touch with anything hard - even your fingernails!,"Horribly fragile - do not place anything on the upper surface! I got a Kindle 2 for my wife's BD and was reading on it when the doorbell rang. I set it down on the sofa and placed the headphones on top of the open Kindle. When I returned, the screen had a huge (1/6 of the display) that was black, with the rest of the screen being white. I turned it off and back on. The screen flickered on-off-on-off with the useless part of the screen staying black. The text to speech still works, but it is a useless paperweight now.I'm returning it."
1,George Orwell would be... Proud?,"Amazon can now remotely delete ANY book you have purchased for the Kindle, using its wireless capabilities:[...]Sure they give you your money back for any books deleted but the book is still gone forever. This is a *major* design flaw that I am compelled to point out NO OTHER eBook readers share. As much as I like the keyboard and the ability to purchase eBooks from Amazon's formidable selection, this one gigantic flaw means I cannot in good conscience recommend the Kindle over any other eBook reader on the market. You would be better served going with Sony even."
1,"Attractive look, but what a crippling software","And so, without your approval, consent, or knowing, Amazon can delete, un-delete, and change the content of your Kindle. Should a company decide what stays in my library? No."
1,All ebooks are equal...,"Imagine your (paper) books could evaporate from you home during the night if the publisher and the bookshop you bought them from decided so. That's exactly what's happened (ironically) to George Orwell's Kindle ebooks '1984' and 'Animal Farm'. No, thanks!"
1,never going to replace the real stuff,"For those who are thinking that when they buy a book for Kindle that they are actually going to own the book... think again! Amazon recently deleted copies of 1984 and Animal Farm off people's Kindle, arguing that the books were not supposed to be published for Kindle. This is extremely disturbing because now you are no longer in charge of the books you pay money for. As a matter of fact, you don't even own a single page of it. You are paying for a ""service."" In essence, Amazon could conceivably tell you what book you are able or not able to read. Amazon could dictate what book you read. Think about it.If you truly want a book, buy the real thing. At least you will own it for good."
3,"love the reader, not happy with the poor spelling of some e books","Great way to read!! easy to use, 'specially after I printed out the full file!. used a LOT of paper & ink, but at 72yrsI prefer papers to look through rather than scrolling through my 'pooter. The reader is ""cool"" and classics are a bargain! Amazon is always a good source for anything! Notedthough, that whoever is putting some books in reader format, can not spell! my copy of The boy captain, a Jules Verne classic, is lousy with ???????? through-out!I hope that ALL books not so infected"
5,Kindle 2,"This product is everyhing I expected and more. I am very pleased with the purchase. The Kindle 2 provides easy reading in all light. The added feature of audio is an excellent addition. I always read with a dictionary, and having that right on the page is another feature I love.I share the Kindle 2 with everyone and many of my friends have made the purchase."
2,Not so pleased with my Kindle 2,I received my Kindle two days ago as a gift and so far have had it crash or freeze no less than six times. It refuses to turn a page sometimes for several minutes and sometimes just plain freezes. I have wanted one of these for about a year and now when I get it I am totally disappointed.Knowing what I know about Kindle 2 I would not purchase. too buggy and unreliable!
3,Worthless For Reference Books,"The Kindle 2 is great for reading books in general and I love that. Unfortunately, although you can buy Kindle versions of reference books, it is worthless for reference. The Kindle will not allow you to go to a specific page in a book, nor does the ""Table of Contents"" function work on many reference books. The Kindle is intended for reading books from beginning to end. Don't waste your money buying reference books."
2,Kindle,"I gave my wife the Kindle Wireless 6"" Reader for Christmas. It lasted a week and then went completely dead. She reported the failure on-line where she was promised a new one would be sent immediately. She ,in turn, was to send the unworking model back within a month or be charged for the second one as well. Its been a week without a new Kindle or a word from Amazon.I know two other Kindle users--one is completely satisfied, the other is in a similar situation as us. My limited past dealings with Amazon have been flawless. What's up with the Kindle??"
