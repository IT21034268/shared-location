5,Buy it!,"If all the republicans went and saw this movie, most of their outlooks on Bush would probably change. This movie is a great wrapup on the past 4 years with George Bush as a preisident. Although there are some boring and confusing parts in this movie, overall it's the best movie this year."
5,Fahrenheit 9/11,If this is anything like bowling for columbine or any of his other excellent documentarys im sure im going to love it. I think this one will be his best yet because it is discussing some current issues and everything george bush trys to keep secret and the events after 911. Everyone should see this film as well as his others. Micheal is very talented and creates unique films with a message.
1,PROPAGANDA!!!,"This movie is atrociously horrible. I'm neither a Bush nor a Kerry fan, but I must say that if you value our own opinion at all do not watch Michael Moore's lastest pile of lies and trash. This man has such a vendeta against the current President that he doesn't care about ethics, morals, or anything else that America values. Having Michael Moore think for you is worse than having GW think for you. Make your own decisions, do your own research. Of course that means you'll have to watch this movie to understand why Moore is easily the largest (literally and figuratively) propagandist since Hitler. But when November comes, make your own choice. Don't let this blowhard decide for you."
3,Good but bias movie: And still voting for Bush...,"Mr. Moore's movie Fahrenheit 9/11, was technically good.I found to be very interesting, and I believe it will go down as one of those films that could change the world or at least the views on America.When tackling this type of subject matter, Moore should acknowledge his role for making more inner-hate within our county and around the world. I think people should see this movie, But should also know how much propaganda went into making it.Before and after the movie I was on the fence on who I was voting for. But after present events, new findings, the GOP convention, and not relying solely on bias broadcast news (CNN), I have decided to go with BUSH for president."
1,Trash,"Make no mistake. This trash is about Michael Moore making money for Michael Moore. Another trash film. What's disturbing is not that idiots like Moore make these films, but that other idiots who watch it, believe the distortions."
1,Minus One Star Equals Zero Stars,"Michael Moore, put down the doughnut, quiet your senseless, biased opinions, jump on a treadmill, and get a real job. We are in the midst of a war against terrorism where Islamic fundamentalits seek to erase our western culture from existence. Over the next few centuries, it is either going to be us or them. If it means blowing up the Holy Land, we're gonna do it! If it means invading and liberating Iraq, which is the epitome of Arabic militarism, we're gonna do it! Thank God Bush was re-elected, because if Kerry pulled us out and Iran became nuclearized...it would be a tremendous victory for global terrorism. Moore doesn't realize that the best defense is usually an aggressive offense!!"
3,Not bad...for propaganda.,"Moore's film, while funny and intertaining, should not be called a DOCUMENTARY. I am sorry to break it to everyone, but this film was so slanted it was teetering on fiction. Facts, soundbites and footage were arranged with dramatic flair to wage war on Moore's sworn enemy--George W Bush and our government's policies. It's great we live in a country that someone can make millions bashing the government that is actually fighting for that very RIGHT. I applaud Michael Moore for his guts and creativity but I believehe has irresponsibly taken advantage of the public's Hollywood-induced gullibility; in an effort to weaken this country's already questionable solidarity. With this movie's fiscal success, Michael Moore can REALLY afford to hate this country. Unfortunately the rest of us can not."
1,Brain Washing,"Fahrenheit 9/11 was a major disappointment to me. I have been a fan of Michael Moore's for several years and have found his other films to be excellent (Roger & Me, Bowling for Culumbine). I found this film to go way beyond the boundries of a documentary. Being in the motion picture industry myself, it was fairly easy for me to see the subtle manipulations he used to get the audience to feel the way he wanted. I think it's very sad when someone uses their talent & influence for their own personal desires without any regard for the truth. I wish people would keep art & politics separate from each other. You lost a fan on this one Michael."
1,Want the real truth... check out FAHRENHYPE 911,"Forget all this propoganda and misleading information. Get the truth, check out www.fahrenhype911.com. Get the FACTS, forget the Fictional Documentary."
1,The truth would set you free,"Let's face it, Moore's only reason for making this film was to get Bush voted out of office. So much for artistic credibility and nonbias.If you're willing to subject yourself to BOTH sides of the story you should watch ""Farenhype 9/11 as well. You can find it at overstock.com I have little hope that Moore's fans will do this since all they want is to unseat President Bush. If they were concerned about the truth they wouldn't bother with Michael Moore, who has NEVER let the truth bother him."
5,Put it on television,This shows the truly ugly underbelly of this administration. U.S. citizens all need to see it. I say put this film on primetime television.
5,Everyone should see this,I think that this is a very important film for our time. It is a must see for everyone.It made me want to get off my butt and do something to help fix this messed up world we live in.
1,Great reviews,"You know going in to this that there would be a ton of reviews, but I thought that more than one would be a critique of the movie. Granted I only read the first twenty or so reviews but you people have to go to a chat room to get out your political gripes. I realize that I'm griping here but you would expect to see more than one out of twenty that give you an idea about the movie. Even the damn Amazon review was bias.Bad reviews= ""Bush is great and Micheal Moore is fat."" Wow, that tells me a lot about the movie.Good reviews= ""Everyone should see this because Bush is bad for or country."" Again, thanks for all the help.Amazon review= ""Micheal Moore shows how under Bush things are worse."" Gotta hand it Amazon for that beauty.Don't you people realize that you are whats wrong. Yes that's the entire thought. YOU ARE WHAT'S WRONG."
1,A great big lie,"For those of you not too informed about politics, let me start by saying this movie is one big fabrication. Michael Moore is a liar. Plain and simple. There is no other way to describe him. Please do not be fooled by his blatently ignorant misrepresentation of our great country. I cant think of one part of the film that was actually true. His mocking of 9/11 and our men and women in uniform is disgusting and disrespectful. I urge anyone not enlightened into the whole political scene to not watch this movie, as it will give you the absolute wrong idea about our soldiers, our country, and our great leader George W Bush. If you are in the know about politics, and can sit through 2 hours of BS, go for it. You wont be impressed."
5,Eye opener,"Over the weekend my mother and I went and seen this movie. I have to say it is a real eye-opener on what really has been going on the last 4 years. Every woman that was a mother, sister, grandmother or there wise didn't have a dry eye. I am pleased someone has chosen to use their voice and show others what they have been missing. We talked about this film all afternoon, and can't wait to see it again!!"
3,Ignorance,"I think it's funny how most of the individuals that write commentary on political subjects are biased toward one side or the other. I'm neither and I'm going to stay that way. Those those of you that haven't seen 'Truth and Lies about 9/11' by Mr. Ruppert are in a rude awakening. Just from watching the trailer it looks as though this movie and the one I just mentioned have similar information and proof to back it up. For all those that are blinded by being on one side you should look at the larger picture instead of just your area of influence (which is pretty small) and face the reality that the government is corrupt.Just to let you all know, I'm a third generation Air Force and I don't see the liberal side nor do I see the conservative side. It is unfortunate these occurances happen to serve a petty goal of just oil and drugs."
5,Every American Should see this before they vote!,To even consider voting without all the facts is irresponsible. See this movie and make an informed decision as to the future of our country! The video of Bush sitting for 7 minutes knowing we were under attack and the heartwrenching loss of Ms. Lipscomb's son are powerful realities that simply must be faced!
5,Not a question of Democrat vs. Republican,"Just came back from seeing this movie; my wife and I thought it was outstanding! Those people who would argue the merits of the Iraq war based upon political affiliation are way off base. This is a question or right versus wrong, not liberal versus conservative. I strongly urge everyone to go see this movie. If you take only one thing with you as you leave the theatre, let it be the idea that you can't always believe what you read in the newspaper or what you see on the t.v. news shows. While I don't think that the movie connects all of the dots correctly, it magnifies enough of the dots where the viewer can than do a little investigating themselves. Don't simply believe the critics in the media who say this movie is a waste of time. See the movie, then check the facts yourself. Most of the information is easily found on the internet."
5,Must See movie,This may be the only place you will ever see the whole corrupt picture called the Bush Administration painted so clearly with startling facts and emotions. Thank you Michael - God bless
5,"Facts, anyone?","Please, dear future reviewers, if you're going to claim that ""Fahrenheit 9/ll"" misrepresents the facts, have the decency to state *what* facts are misrepresented. (Hint: it does not logically follow that if you disagree with someone they're telling lies.)"
2,expected more from Michael Moore,"I had to shut off Farenheight 9/11 because it was so terrible and unbalanced. I'm not a fan of Bush, but I didn't think the movie was fair or accurate in many ways. It was just too petty."
4,Sure is food for thought,"I hear a lot of static about this, as with all Moore's movies, but I don't see anyone presenting the opposing side with any real meat. I'm not particularly a Moore fan, but I have to admit that he asks some real questions.This movie was really good. It was entertaining, funny, sad, and scary and eye opening. I don't think it matters what side you're on, if you're not willing to ask the questions and demand answers, then you're just the puppet ""they're"" expecting you to be. This movie is definitely worth your time and money. Whether or not it opens any doors for you or not, depends on how open your mind is, I guess. It made me go back and watch some of his other movies. The ones I avoided because of all the skeptical hype about the man. I'm glad I did. I'm not saying I agree with everything he's trying to say, but I would like to see someone show the other side."
5,Great Job by M. Moore,"Ofcourse this is a film made before it's time. The American people were not ready for such shocking truth in 2004. However as time passes, some of those voices of hate and anger at this film and it's truth telling will soon diminish. Great insite into the the morning of 9-11 and why Bush did nothing with the warnings he received from his PDB's. Why Norad stood down instead of following normal protocol... Why the air traffic control tapes were destroyed... The personal story of a lady who loved Bush had a military family and had a son who went to Iraq for Bush. She later comes to grip with the death of her son and makes a 180 degree turn in her thoughts about war and Bush after not getting answers from the Pentagon. Great insite as well into the thoughts of some of our young boys over there who have fun like a video game spraying down ""ragheads"". I don't blame them, but it's the culture we have created of fear, hate, and ultra patriotism (jingoism)."
1,false editing,"We really liked ""bowling for columbine"", My husband and I watched this and were soooooo drawn in .......then right after we watched another docu. called FAREN""HYPE"" 911. in which almost everyone from the original M. Moore film were interviewed. Most were angered by how their comments were edited and put in this film. I was blown away by how many of those interviewed were misrepresented in this film. Leading me to believe if Moore chip chopped and edited their interviews to suit his own viewpoint, how much else of the film was actually true? I am sure a lot but now I do not trust him and I am certainly second guessing the info he provided in B-F-COLUMBINE. SEE BOTH FILMS JUDGE FOR YOURSELF"
5,See for yourself!,"Being an ""independent"" I was on the fence about the war and the elections. I was curious to see if this film was fiction or truth, or maybe a little of both. All I can say is ""see it"" and then decide. The personal aspect brought out by the soldiers and their families brought it all home to me. War was always something we had to fight to defend our freedom, but this time it seems we choose to fight! Hmmm..was Osama in that hole with Saddam? Nope! Bad intelligence I guess!"
5,Switched this Card Carring Republican,"I'm a card carrying Republican, and it's helped to convince me to vote for John and John. I'm afraid if we don't, the next country to fall will be Iran, then Pakistan, ... it's the old Domino Theory from the days of Vietnam, only in reverse. WE are the one's trying to conquer the world."
1,Call It Like It Is,"For this to be deemed a ""documentary"" is an absolute joke. It is a blending of fact, fiction, half-truths, and one-man's opinion. If Moore were any more desperate for the attention he is so clearly seeking, he'd strap a webcam on the bill of his cap and webcast himself ranting 24-7. Just because someone says it doesn't mean it's so, and this movie is no exception. If Moore told you that the gravel in his front yard was actually moon rocks, would you believe him? Based on box office figures, I hate to say that it looks like plenty of you would. Wake up, sheep. The mainstream media may not be telling the whole truth, the White House may not be telling the whole truth, but this blowhard sure isn't doing it either."
1,A fictional movie ment to look like a documentry...,"If you want the hard facts, do yourself a favor and watch fahrenHYPE9/11. Some of Moore's conspiracies are just outragous."
1,Manipulating Jerk,"This movie is a load of crap. All he does is distort the truth, and edits the movie to make it seem bad when it really isn't. For example when President Bush is playing golf and he says ""We're going to get these terroists, now watch me hit this ball"" Their is 19 minutes of him talking about other stuff between ""We're going to get these terroists"" and ""Now watch me hit this ball"". Oh the magic of editing. Don't give this lying fat piece of lard your money."
1,What a joke,"This tripe is supposed to sway people's opinions? Right. This is a political ad for the Democratic Party. If you hate the military, corporations and President Bush, you'll love it. Otherwise save your $$."
1,this film helped me vote for the right guy,"I was going to vote for John Kerry until about 2 months before the presidential election. After putting it off for some time, I finally watched this film and was disgusted by how contrived it is. Bowling for Columbine is interesting except for the parts where he uses fake camera angles and all. This is just a big pack of one-sided distortions. Like I said, I was all for Kerry, but it was a bunch of little things like the Michael Moores and all the other libs going nuts and pumping lies into the tv that really turned me off. I look forward to his next film. It'll push me to vote republican again probably."
1,Whats wrong with the US,"I've been sitting here reading the reviews of this movie and am sooo disapointed with my countrymen. The only group of people who could possibly fall for this piece of left wing propoganda are those who get the news from Hollywood. If you want to know whats going on in Iraq talk to the hero's who have fought there. In this war or the last. If you want to get all the ""facts"" dont go to the fools that live in Hollywood. Try watching more than just your local news. Watch all news programs CNN, FOX, BBC or for those out there who can read pick up some newspapers. Bush is'nt God but, Moore is'nt either. Please start using YOUR brains and stop buying into whats shown to you."
1,Not a Documentary,"Although the film does create discussion, the problem (as with all Moore ""documentary"" films) is it is a one-sided account where most of his allegations are either not true or they lack sufficient evidence. Thus, this film is not a documentary because it is not an honest account but a misleading political piece aimed to bolster Moore's own political views."
4,Pretty good.,"Obviously slanted to fit Moore's far left ideas, but the information presented is quite interesting. It doesn't necessarily blame Bush for 9/11, but it shows his past connections and actions after 9/11. You have to take certain things with a grain of salt, but I thoroughly enjoyed the film."
1,Don't make complaining americans rich!!!!!!!!,I can't believe americans would pay to see some american complain and make fun about his own country. It's like if I were to make a movie about how little I get paid and then get rich off of it. I think if someone would like to see this movie it should be a bootleg version.
1,Anti-American Trash,"Moore is about as anti-American as it gets. His work is dangerous to the common public. He distorts and twists so many views and takes too many things out of context. Moore is self centered and money hungry. He cares nothing about this country or the people in it. If you are quick to jump on the band waggen with Moores views, then at least know the facts. Research both sides without bias. Then make your decision about what is closer to the truth. Extreamist on either side are close minded and blind to better good of the people."
3,How is your Family doing in the USA?,"Hi,My name is Mike also. I like the way you handled the work you did in this video. During the time the Twin Towers were being destroyed, the President of the US was sitting and playing around with children in Sarasota Fl. (I hated that!)I have a brother and a sister they both want to be writers and journalists,,me too!Write us,,""the people of the USA"",,tell us if you need body guards...Is your family safe? (brothers,sisters,etc)YOUR COOL! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK! THE US NEEDS PEOPLE LIKE YOU!!!"
1,A minupulator trying his best,"Michael Moore is a lying idiot. He creates lies and puts them into a highly advertised movie. Once the television previews lure young people into the theatres, his lies manipulate the minds of these poor young children. His so called ""documentaries"" are used to brainwash people my age. I am only 17 and I know that a few of my friends went to watch this film and came back just believing that the U.S.A was a terrible place to live because of President Bush. President Bush is a great man with great morals and beliefs. I cannot believe some one would have the nerve to publicly try to humiliate our President. Michael Moore is an idiot. He just needs to tell the truth before making a film and making a fool of himself. I love the U.S.A and hate Michael Moore. If you are a patriot to this great country, I advise you not to support this fool buy watching and listening to his lies."
1,"The boy who cries ""wolf""","People keep paying for movies made by a person who has wasted his ""talent"" on partial truths to flat out lies. What type of a person would waste his life on lies? Oh, yeah...a person who wants to make money off of ignorant people(I say this with no intentions to insult).It is ashame that people, like Mr. Moore, are not held accountable for their deceit. Well, eventually they will be. I actually feel sorry for him and for those who believe that he is telling them the truth.People like Mr. Moore actually hold back the truth and belittle and attack those who hold truth and honor as being important."
1,Michael Moore,I think Michael Moore is a giant wuss whom is mad at the US for not giving him everything in life. To fat and overweight to do anything include going the military to comprehend how the world really works outside of his house and from behind him Television. I rate this 1 star because it was poorly put together and missing a lot of important information. Only a quarter of the information is presented to the viewer.
1,When the truth is found.....to be lies,"I was one of many to be fooled by Mike Moore. Origionally, I thought Mean Mike had one heck of a masterpiece, until I heard the real story that is explained in the new blockbuster Fahrenhype 911. I am not an ardent Bush supporter, and I am angry because Moore allowed the rug to be pulled out from under him BECAUSE HE DID NOT STICK TO THE FACTS!! Dad Burnitt!! Moore could blow this election for Kerry yet!!"
1,michael's maddness,"i suggest you do some research. for example, go to about any encyclopedia website, download the timeline that is sure to be there, and look up things like bin laden, uss cole, dar es sallaam tanzania, nirobi kenya, bill clinton, cold-war terrorism, and whatever you deem neccessary. I hear this 'crokumentary' makes you think that bush, of all people, is responsible for the terror attack of 9-11, so i am here to rescue you from certain misinformation."
1,Dishonest,Let's get real. Why support or promote a documentary that is neither honest or straight-forward? Michael Moore is a self-serving hypocrite that is bad for politics and bad for America. Shame on the naive who view this trash as the gospel truth.
1,True Crap,"This is so biased it's nothing but B.S. It gets one star because zero stars was not an option. This is so one-sided politically. People who had a different opinion, the truth, were edited out of this. Michael Moore is a big fat liar. And this is released right before the election. Coincidence? Let's hope Americans are not duped by this horse manure."
1,used in propaganda class as prime example,"Used in propaganda class as prime example. As an example of pure manipulated propaganda it rates a 5, but if marketed as factual rate this less than a 1."
1,Roger S. was wrong,My friend Roger is my biggest democrat friend Roger insists that GW is Satan reincarnated and I am sure that's what he puts into his comments of his code (he even voted for Mondale)... maybe that's why he said I would like the movie...but I didn't.
1,Crap,"Very one-sided and a poor excuse for a ""documentary."" Intelligent people of all politcal backgrounds should save their money and time."
3,911 in an interesting movie,"OK, so maybe I don't believe it all, but it sure does make you think. After watching this movie I started internet searching some of the information and topics in this flick. YIKES!!!The Sweet Smell of ASH in the Morning: The Pocket EditionThe Legacy Of George W Bush: (A Collection Of Conflicting Opinions)Descendents of the Pantheons: A Graphic Novel"
5,God Bless Moore,"I am amazed at the thorough defense Michael Moore's web site, michaelmoore.com, gives the facts in this movie! I enjoyed the movie, even though I was nauseated by the truth about the Bush administration- Some things I almost wish I didn't know.This movie has effected me deeply. My mind has been completely changed on a number of issues. It has to be watched.You have to see the ending of this movie!"
2,A well-made film that should have stuck to the facts.,"Michael Moore's film style is solid and engaging, and Fahrenheit 9/11 is an excellent example of that style. Seeing this movie I was shocked, so I did some research to find out more. Instead of finding out more, though, I discovered that much of this movie is highly inaccurate and designed to decieve. Were the film based on fact I'd be extremely impressed, but as it's not I'm extremely disappointed."
3,"Still worth viewing, but flawed","For all the hate he garners, I still say God Bless Micheal Moore for going against the tide when that was a very dangerous thing to do. He does probably merit some criticism for being manipulative and sometimes, he arranges information in a decontextualized way that can come off as conspiratorial. By I really don't think this is a ""Truther"" documentary, just a scathing indictment of the laxity of the Bush Administration, that rightly had it coming. For him to accomplish this in the eye of the mainstream, at the time that he did, before everyone else was parroting it, took a lot of nerve."
4,ignore the right wing slander machine,"whatever your political ideology farenheit 9/11 is worth seeing. Yes sure mike is biased but would he be effective if he sat on the fence? would anyone bother to listen to him? probably not. He is sensational to get the message out there, what you make of it is your own PERSONAL opinion. Ignore the declarations that the movie is ahem ""excrement"" those are low blows from individuals who don't bother to come up with adequete hypothesis' as to WHY one shouldn't see the film. It is NOT a hoard of lies, and it is NOT an unbiased glance at the Bush Administration but niether of those things is really a surprise.Personally I was moved not by the idiocy of Bush which everyone has come to accept but by the images of broken and bloodied children who have lost their homes and families and likely their futures."
1,Moore has no credibility,"This work has already been shown to be full of deliberate misrepresentations, distortions, and outright lies. Moore admitted his bias up front, and people that were included in some of the scenes have complained that their viewpoints were totally distorted. The liberal Hollywood community pointedly failed to even nominate this turkey for anything such as a Golden Globe or an Oscar. The effect of this silly mish mash is to reduce Moore's credibility on his other projects rather than to say something real. Alhough he may look like the proverbial 800 pound gorilla, all he can produce is minor monkey shines."
1,NOT A DOCUMENTARY,"This film is not factual, but merely over 90 minutes of Moore's take on things in his twisted viewpoints. This movie is complete crap! and should not influence anyone because it is an op/ed and NOT a documentary."
3,Fahrenheit 9/11,Truly great example of how to take half truths and try to present them as having some basis in truth. A great piece of radical left propaganda. Now I know why Mr. Moore helped the Republicans to sweep into office. Well worth watching to understand how out of touch the left is with people in the red counties.
1,This is garbage,I must admit that I did have preconceived notions about this piece of fiction; despite this I did try to watch the film with an open mind.This is truly garbage. It is full of out and out lies.
1,Excrement,"Cinematic excrement from a man who loathes America. He makes Oliver Stone look like a historian. He makes Leni Riefenstahl look like a journalist. He makes D.W. Griffith look fair and balanced. He should have made a film like ""Super Size Me,"" sticking with material that he knows."
4,9/11 Thoughts,"I thought that a few spots were overly long, but all in all I thought there were some very good items to think about. A few spots may have been over the top, but not as bad as some newspaper reviews have been. Some times it takes a shock to get the thinking going. Generally, it was a good film."
3,Documentary or Propaganda.. you decide,"Documentary Film = motion picture that shapes and interprets factual material for purposes of education or entertainment.Propaganda Film = The term is usually restricted, however, to pictures made deliberately to influence opinion or to argue a point.Propaganda = the spreading of ideas, information, or rumor for the purpose of helping or injuring an institution, a cause, or a person.. Ideas, facts, or allegations spread deliberately to further one's cause or to damage an opposing cause; also : a public action having such an effect.Think for yourself or let Michale Moore do your thinkng for you.If you watch with a critical eye, there will be value, whatever your political persuasion. But the 5 stars thing is a case of wishful thinking."
1,Don't Bother,[...]. There are young men fighting in Iraq and afganistan to assure the freedom for michael moore to spew this bile disguised as the truth. I do not recommend this to anyone.
5,Dare to be honest,"Mr. Moore shows a great deal of honesty and sincerity. The film has trully opened some people eyes of what's been going on in US, at least, after watching the movie my mind got opened to a larger extent. I'm not American but I deeply emphatized with the people who's lost their loved ones in the war or from the terrorist attack. Whether or not the pictures were juxtaposed so that it looks as ""real"" as a propaganda, salute for Mr.Moore's bravery and confidence to create such film. Hats off! Sometimes the real truth hurts, but it's better knowing than never knowing at all."
1,Absolutly atrociuos,To call something this biased a documentary is appalling. This movie is so poorly done it discredits everything Michael Moore is attempting to acheive.
1,Just Pandering to Anti-Bush Crowd,"This crockumentary just panders to the anti-bush crowd. I have to hand it to Michael Moore, he knows how to make a buck off of stupid people.There are so many dead-ends and lies in this movie.Read 59 Deceits of Fahrenhiet 9/11 and actually learn something instead of letting your brain atrophy to Moore's piece of garbage."
1,A propaganda film for the ages,"I'm giving this movie 1 star because Michael Moore presents this movie as fact. This it is not, Moore takes footage without the concent of the person hes interviewing on several occasions, and takes the footage out of context. A number of other things in the movie just arent true, and have been disproven by the 9/11 commission. Watch it if you want but do not take it all for fact, do your own research to form opinions on this country and administration. Dont take an extremists opinion"
1,Ineffective,"Ah yes, I remember Moore's statements on how no one who saw his movie could vote for Bush. The bloated liar was so convinced that Bush would lose, and his film would have a hand in it. It appears that the American people are not as gullible as Moore thinks. In the movie Moore makes fun of and villifies Bush... a lot. But on this day after the election I have just one question for michael moore. Who is laughing now?"
1,THIS MOVE IS A HORRIBLY BIAS AND UNACURATE,This movie is the most liberally bias movie that i have ever seen. It is unacurate and filled with enough liberal bias to make the most liberal of people to see this is overly bias and unacurate. It is filled with made up information and he is constatly controdicting himself. Micheal Moore is just a little man trying to voice his opinion on a mute point.
2,"If you don't read the news daily, steer clear","Although I was entertained by this film (though not to the tune of $9), I went into it with the belief that it would be more of a documentary-style film.Michael Moore has it in for the Bush administration, a position I personally respect. But my BIG fear now is that many who view this film coming from a like perspective will see it for something it isn't - an unbiased documentary (i.e., the whole truth).My advice: if you get your political ""news"" from the Daily Show and Late Night with David Letterman, stay away from this movie like the plague. You get just one side in this movie and anything that doesn't ""fit"" has clearly been edited out.3 stars as entertainment. 1 star for masquerading as a documentary."
2,Why let us down?,"Michael, Michael, Michael. Who are you really? An overblown American icon who has figured out a lucrrative niche and exploits it to the max? A true believer who wants a better world? You hype one thing and do another. Do you help the cause of peace or do you merely use it for your own benefit. You are angry at Bush but you wouldn''t mind us fighting the ""right"" war! You find a soft spot and make a big movie out of it while stuffing your belly and your pockets. I am so upset at you.You aren't sincere. You are an entertainer, No different than any of the Right Wing clowns who dance on the media stage. Stop pretending to be the real thing while making millions with the ""oh poor me"" publicity stunts. You have so much access, do something truthful with it!"
2,BUSH WON!,"""How can you possibly discuss foreign policies in the middle east without mentioning Israel and its ties with the US ??""So one of these reviewers asked. How can you... well, USA exterior policy gives a huge S**T to Israel and whatever happen there between palestins and Israel. Let them blow themselves UP! All the money is going to Iraque War and let me know why they're still there. Sadam isnt there anymore. Mass Destruction Weapons werent there at any time. Probably Osama isnt. So Why? Vietnam didnt want USA provisory government and neither Iraque people will accept it."
2,Leftist opinions,"This film is based on Michael Moore's oppinion of President George Walker ""Dubeau"" Bush and nothing more. While it does have some truths in it, there are scenes in which he blames Bush for doing something that was all opinional. Example. It you asked five hundred people whether Bush should have stayed in the classroom for the time he did after he received the news that America was under attack, half the people would say that what he did was right, and and the other half will agree with Moore and say that he should have left immediatey because Richard Cheney can't run a country. It is purely a manner of oppinion, and because Bush stayed in the classroom doesn't make him a bad person (...).So, if you are a leftist who hates Bush and likes Michael Moore's oppinion of Bush, this is a great video to get. However, if you want a non biased view of the Bush administration, ask Ralph Nader."
1,America is in BIG trouble,"The USA is in for some very rough times as long as weak minded people continue to rely on propaganda and misinformation to make important decisions. The likes of Michael Moore and Sean Hannity pose the same threat, just from opposite directions. Here's a suggestion for you . . . if you'd truly like to know what happened on 9/11, read the 9/11 commission report. If you just want to see someone make fun of Bush, thereby propping up your self esteem, by all means, this movie is for you and the rest of the lazy masses."
1,Moore and his trador followers,"This movie is so full of BS i only watched a little over a half hour. This Trador moore tells lies and half truths and takes advantage of morning parents. Another thing that pissed me off, they didn't give me a refund at the movie theatre. A movie as horrible as this one, you should get a refund. I can't believe that there are morons in this country that no only think this piece of crap was good, but also believe all the BS in this movie.. I guess if he made a movie about how there really is an easter bunny those morons would believe it."
1,WHY WOULD YOU WATCH SOMETHING YOU KNOW TO BE UNTRUE?,"Michael Moore holds himself up as a paragon of truth, but there are known lies in this movie that film-goers should be aware of going in. They have been well documented and broadcast.This movie is brought to you by the same Anti-Bush folks who sponsor CBS/Dan Rather hate and bias. People who have taught us time and again it is OK to forge documents and edit film events no matter what the FACTS are. Contrary to Moore's belief system, things were not all kite-flying and wonderful with Saddam Hussein. Check out the book SADDAM: KING OF TERROR by Con Coughlin for a reality check. Coughlin did his research on Saddam Hussein before the war.Michael Moore is a lying hate-monger. Don't let him polute your mind."
3,Wasted opportunity,"I watched this film last night, and having sympathy with many of Michael Moores views, I was expecting to enjoy it. I was in the end a little dissapointed. I felt the movie would have had a much stronger impact had it adopted a more neutral tone.Michael Moore's self-righteous pushing of his own agenda quickly became irritating, clouding many of the issue's he raised. Anyone with a reasonable knowledge of world events will have noticed him being economical with the truth (e.g. the omission of Britain from the coallition) with the sole purpose of manipulating emotions. I found this a little rich considering his scathing attacks on the US government's fear promotion tactics.Nonetheless, this is an important film. These issues needed to be raised, it's just a shame a greater focus was'nt place on the facts in hand rather than Moore's own anger."
5,GO SEE IT!,"Do yourself a favor and go see this eye-opening movie. If it doesn't make you question the decisions your elected officials make about foreign policy, there is nothing else I can say."
2,I prefer a Documentary that presents the facts accurately,"The title sums, it up. Michael Moore has been called on so many of the bogus, unfounded, or flat out untrue ""information"" that i makes wonder why people still praise his movie if it does nothing but buff their political feelings, even if its not true. Michael Moore aside from being the wealthiest socialist (which in itself is hypocritical), continues to push political propoganda which condemns those who work for their money and makes those who dont out to be victims.This man makes me sick to have to recognize him as a fellow american."
1,"Lies, lies and more lies","The subtle deviations from reality and the outright lies in this movie are so plentiful and are now so well documented that I don't see why anyone still talks about this ""documentary"" (as far as documentaries go This Is Spinal Tap had a firmer foundation in the truth than does Moore's film). This is nothing more than an irrational ""I hate Bush and I don't care if I'm logical about my argument because my hatred is enough to make my feelings valid"" vehicle for people who don't want to think and prefer to just surrender their minds to any popular demogogue. Read Dave Kopel's (a 2000 Nader supporter like Moore was) ""Fifty-nine Deceits in Fahrenheit 9/11"" article to see just how baseless and devoid of any real facts this movie is."
1,Trash,"This movie is a trashed view of the Bush administration. It is one sided and very derogatory towards our leaders in the government. Moore takes no responsibility for his actions, always seeing that it is the other side who fault it is. Don't waste your money or time watching this movie. This is bad."
1,Total Bologne,"What a joke. This documentary is full of lies and half truthes. Form the fake headlines that Michelle Moore used to the incorrect facts about ties between the Bin Laden family and the Bush family. This movie has one purpose-make people dislike Bush. I can't believe that a movie is going to help determine the outcome of a Presidential election. Michelle Moore will say anything to get people to dislike President Bush. Michelle Moore harasses people in all of his documentaries. Everyone is upset at the Swift Boat veterans for running the ads trying to discredit John Kerry. This piece of junk movie had the same purpose towards President Bush. I wish Americans would listen to the facts instead of listening to people like Michelle Moore, P. Diddy, Whoopi Goldberg, adn Dave Matthews. Watch this movie if you want, but don't belive anything you hear or see............."
1,Not worth your time.,This is like paying money to see a political ad. This kind of movie could have been made for Bush or Kerry. It's simply politicaly motivated hollywood hype.
5,Fahrenheit 9/11,A truly great movie. Full of facts every American should know.Michael Moore is a great patriot and a brave man. He is wealthy and doesn't need to care about anyone else but he cares enough to tell us the truth. He has backed everything in the movie up with facts that can't be disputed. I am deeply grateful to him.I recommend this to everyone who loves their country and wants to know the truth.
1,Documentary or Propaganda?,"Clearly this film is not a documentary. It is a well-edited propaganda piece based on a particular point of view. Moore does a good job of making his points, not significantly different points than the typical Sunday news program, with the exception that there is no attempt to show both sides. As a one-sided view, this appears to be a ninety minute advertisement for the Democratic party. As a documentary, there is little of value, that has not been claimed or asserted on other media outlets."
1,more propaganda...,"from the neo-goebbels himself, michael moore. witness the farce that was 'bowling for columbine', a film with good intentions but little else...and now this piece of manipulative garbage. moore admitted in an interview with stephanopoulos that this 'was not a documentary, but more of a political action piece.' he also admitted that his only real goal was to unseat pres. bush. what a joke. either you drink the kool-aid or you don't people. if you think this film is a documentary, you're already lost."
1,filled with distortion,enough has been said about this movie but if you believe his presentation you are not looking at the real facts. don't be blinded by sensationalism and prejudice
3,Do you really believe...?,"Go and watch Zeitgeist (zeitgeistmovie dot com)for a real objective point of view.Farenheit is very well done, but lacks political detachment."
4,Moore Takes Liberties But Asks Good Questions,"I can see why conservatives, especially religious right conservatives would be very angry at this film. Moore is clearly not playing by the rules. He does ask some very good questions, even though he goes overboard on several issues like the possible Bush/Saudi connection, the congressmen who don't put their kids in the military or Bush's military friend who later represented the Bin Ladens.He does ask questions that many of us are afraid to ask and to ask those questions, I think, makes a democracy healthier and stronger. Michael is clearly worried about the health of our democracy and what vision this president has in sending our troops to Iraq, when there may not be a solid plan in place, or a plan not based on solid evidence.The movie didn't always make logical sense but the movie made me feel, and that is what GREAT movies do, they make you feel deeply."
5,A Mind Blower!,"Fahrenheit 9/11 just blew my mind when I saw it. It gives a complete new perspective on the politics of the US and on Bush's administration. The film's objectivity is not to be questioned, cause Michael Moore gives clear evidence on everything. This movie really shows what America is like in this new era and how innocent people die for its welfare. I am amazed that this film was actually released for the open public and that the author wasn't hanged on the street. I wouldn't be surprised if that happened."
1,Documentary NOT,"My one-star review for this tall tale was deleted, removed - poof! Gone. No wonder there are mostly 5 star reviews for this movie. Either Moore or his comrades are complaining to Amazon about negative reviews, for one reason or another, and they are being removed. That is typical of the Left. Only positive reviews will be tolerated, eh comrade?What was it that made someone demand my one-star review be removed? Was it my pointing how how Moore didn't show the responses of the congressmen he approached about signing their children up for the war? Was it my pointing out that Richard Clarke has contradicted Michael Moore regarding his portrayal of the bin laden family leaving America after 9/11/01? Was it my stating that we should be united, and that Moore should be charged with treason? That is my opinion. I think his movie is a disgrace. It is a farce disguised as a serious piece. It is a sinister farce - to borrow words from Christopher Hitchens."
1,"""Documentaries"" are supposed to contain facts!","As stated in my title line...documentaries are supposed to be based on facts...but then, John Kerry would probably agree with my review before he disagrees with it (sound familiar?).Don't you just love how Moore has such a rabid need to bash Pres. Bush at any & all costs to the truth, when Clinton was the pres. for the previous 8 years and turned down chances to both ""aquire"" Osama bin-Laden as well chances to kill him? But, no...the entire culture of America's intelligence community falls upon the shoulders of a man who was president for less than 8 months!Liberals take note: wanting something to be the truth doesn't make it facts! Michael Moore has given us in 2004 a ""documentary"" just as Orson Welles gave us a ""documentary"" in 1938 (The War of the Worlds!)"
1,All you need to know about this movie is this single thing:,"...Every Islamic terrorist organization in the world has come out and not only openly endorsed this movie, but have publicly stated that they would do their best to help Michael Moore get this movie shown in as many countries as possible. Do you honestly need to know anything more than that? If so, then you're a bigger genetic misfire than Michael Moore is, because even HE knows this. You can look this up on both CNN and Fox News web sites. He continually AIDS AND COMFORTS THE ENEMY with this movie and his speeches. This stupid, fat white man is laughing all the way to the bank. Not only is this sedition, but U.S. Constitution Article 3, Section 3 defines his propaganda as ""treason""."
3,Moore does what he does best,"The film needs to be seen. by all parties. Say what you will about Moore, whether he's a sensationalist, propagandist or a patriot, this movie (look at all the reviews) have done what I really enjoy about all his movies. It makes you think about issues and it tugs at your emotions; whether hatred, disgust, admiration, disbelief.I don't always agree with Mr. Moore, (especially in this movie)but I really admire him for putting the issues out into the open. I don't remember the last time I had a political conversation with my friends except after this movie.So I give it a neutral 3 stars."
1,Michael Less,"9/11 is not even mediocre fiction. Moore is nothing but a bitter fat kid looking to strike back for being consistently chosen last in gym class. As an individual, wholly lacking in talent,integrity,and substance, he has succeeded, at one level,in demonstrating that America is truly the land of opportunity. Where else would a charlatan, creating his own version of reality, meet with such astonishing success? Simply put, he is a creative, unscrupulous,liar, with a curiously gullible following."
5,MORE THEN EXPECTED,"The service on this item was great especially it was Xmas the turn around was great.The item itself was much better than expected. Most items appear nice online but usually fall a bit in actual view in hand. This was wonderful as it was a gift for my daughter-in-law she loves Angels and was totally pleased.Will shop this persons items again.Milt LaneMoyock, NC US"
3,I Agree with the last person!,"How can I purchase this book when I know nothing about it? If anyone has read this book, a real review would be greatly appreciated!"
4,Great Price!,"These were double the price on another site! My little girl LOVES these speakers! She is using them with her pc.my ONLY complaint and it's my complaint and not my lil girl's...is that the sound quality is poor. Obviously, not the speakers to get for real sound quality...but kids love them!"
2,Seems used!!,"To be honest, when I first saw this caliper it seemed used...it was in good shape but definitely seemed used... I then noticed it doesn't really fit in the plastic box it was sent in and the box was broken. Some may think the latter could have happened in the trip from the store to my hands but the box was fixed using transparent tape which makes me think it was fixed in the store. Its a hassle for me to return it because I'm far from the US so I guess I'll keep it (and it works after all...)"
4,an exciting book,"The novel is suitable for the ages from 11-15/16. ""how to survive Summer camp"" is a teenage book, especially for girls. It's good for these ages, because the author wrote about problems which are solved at the end of the story. It's a good example of how to handle problems for teenage-girls.The story is about Stella, who can't stand the summer camp she has to attend while her mother and her new husband go on honeymoon a lot of exciting things happen, which make the book very good. One of my favourite events from that book is how Stella wants to make friends and be nice, while other girls are treating her badly and giving her names like ""BALDY"". I like the way she handels it all by herself and without her relatives or any other friends. I also like her ignorance when the other girls annoye her. The book is very exciting and shows a lot of feelings."
5,Cute socks,"Perfect trouser sock - made of good, high quality material, washes well and the color looks just like the photo. Very happy with them!"
4,A Small Town Novel,"After receiving a new copy of Tom Drury's The End of Vandalism as a gift, I evaluated the interesting and colorful cover, a picture of a barn's hayloft in orange twilight, and read the short summary on the back. My first thought was, ""a novel about a Midwestern town?"" But, after reading the first chapter, I realized that the novel is really about the connections and relationships in small towns--lives, not so different in their basic form from our own--and the funny and tragic things that happen within them. Drury treats his characters, despite their sometimes misguided lives, with a gentle hand. If we met many of them in person we would think they were small-minded, of limited intelligence or aspirations, and provincial (""hicks""). Through his illumination of their idiosyncrasies, which are often comical, he makes his characters more interesting and more real (rounded). The novel is sometimes a meandering and languid read, but ultimately it's very rewarding."
2,Light and forgettable,"This book is full of detail and description, but is somehow still flat and unsatisfying. It comes across as a fantasy view of small town life--which I don't think was intentional. The characters are varied and posessing a variety of personal problems, but the edges are all rounded and comfortable. There are obvious attempts at being quirky and keeping loose ends from being neatly trimmed, both of which get in the way of the story. I found myself thinking ""I expect such and such to happen, but I know it won't because the author doesn't want to be predicatable."" In the end, very light and forgettable."
4,This or nothing?,"I'm one of the faithful who watched 'Roseanne' from day one. THIS is one DVD set I've been waiting for. Of course, we all know about the ""issue""... but I don't think its awful enough to make me not buy it.First off, who says they'll even release more if this set sells poorly? Second, WHY do they have edited episodes? What if they never release the full ones for some reason? No one knows exactly what's going on, it's all speculation at this point. Maybe everyone should email Anchor Bay Entertainment (google it) instead of just writing reviews on here. Somehow I doubt the execs are browsing Amazon to see what everyone thinks.The show is AWESOME and I would rather have this than absolutely nothing. I'm giving it 4 stars because of the edit only, the show itself is 5."
1,Ridiculous,"This DVD is edited! How could some people just not care. If I'm never going to be able to watch Roseanne on television again in 2012, then I'm going to want to buy the DVD's, but if I'm going to buy them, I want to buy them if they're not unedited. I have written many complaints to AnchorBay about the edited episodes, and they said there is nothing thy can do. That is bullcrap. I just will not buy the set if the episodes are edited.Why would someone want to buy a DVD for $40 if the episodes are edited!? It's a waste of money, and if the sets are continuously edited, I will not buy, and I say that no one should buy to show Anchor bay and Carsey-Werner a lesson.I'm only a kid, and Roseanne is my all-time favorite show, but I still won't buy an edited Roseanne DVD, even if I willl never be able to see it again on Cable TV.ALso, I was just wondering if someone could tell me the email address for Carsey-Werner."
1,"Good News, But An Awful Set","I think the other reviewers have all said it very well. Roseanne is a queen of comedy and her show remains unriviled in quality, especially those brilliant first six seasons. If ever a show deserved a totally ultimate edition, way too many special features, UNCUT high def presentation, it's Roseanne.Well, as we all know by now, these episodes are totally cut, not uncut at all, which makes the title ""Complete First Season"" completely false. If material is edited out of an episode, it is not complete, and if two-three minutes of material are edited out of 23 episodes, that renders the whole set incomplete.Anyway, I do have good news. The fans have spoken and the company has listened. The next eight seasons are being planned for uncut releases. We can only hope that the first season is fixed sometime and returned to its proper form. Until that happens, I will never waste a single penny on this worthless, lazy set of a great show that deserves better."
1,Edited Episodes -- this set is NOT complete!,"According to Anchor Bay (the studio releasing this set), these will be the SYNDICATED versions of the episodes rather than the UNCUT originally aired episodes. This means that there are 2 to 3 minutes of footage CUT from each episode so the syndicators could cram more commercials into 30 minutes. These EDITED episodes were provided to Anchor Bay by Carsey-Werner -- Anchor Bay has no control over the content of the release, but A MESSAGE MUST BE SENT TO THESE STUDIOS! First ""The Cosby Show"" released syndicated episodes, now ""Roseanne"". Two of the most popular, best-loved shows of the last 15 years DESERVE better treatment than this! Cancel your pre-orders NOW!!"
1,Roseanne deserves better,"The studio that is releasing this must think we're completely stupid. To serve up an edited release of this show, and expect us to lap it up like salivating dogs is offensive. I have been waiting for this show for years, but what's the purpose of having a second-rate version?"
1,Beware...EDITED/CUT episodes !!!,"It is getting ridiculous how often studios are released EDITED, CUT versions of TV shows instead of the full versions as seen on network TV. Why pay money for edited content? Each show is cut by 2 minutes or so, so you miss about 10% of the episode. If you think it isn't a big deal, feel free to send me 10% of your paycheck each week....AVOID this set, write a polite letter to the studio telling them why you won't buy it and maybe they'll get the message that consumers want the full version on DVD, not edited junk. If you taped these off the original ABC airing, hold on to the the tapes!Sorry to say THE COSBY SHOW DVD is the same situation, as is the first season of THAT'S MY MAMA."
1,Should Be 5 Stars--But Not For Syndicated Cuts,"Well, there goes another great show off my list because of syndicated cuts. I don't mind one or two syndicated versions in a season set, but not the entire season. Sorry. Anchor Bay and Carsey Werner messed up on this. I won't be buying this set unless it is the complete uncut episodes. I can watch the butchered epidsodes for free on TV. Poor, poor, poor release of such a great show."
1,Will not support edited dvd's,"As much as I love this show, I will not spend money on edited episodes. BIG mistake Carsey Werner."
1,Edited Versions,"I would have given this 5 stars for great features and a great first season, except Carsey-Werner (I don't think Anchor Bay had a say in this) have released edited versions of this show.I won't pay $40 for missing material. What is the point? I should just tape them off the TV."
3,"Good, but packaging is kind of flimsy",The discs were in good condition even though the prongs on the plastic circle that holds one of the discs in was broken when it arrived so I had to use tape to hold it into the case. This has happened with other Roseanne boxed sets that I have purchased. The distributer should look into making the packaging more durable so that it isn't so inconvenient to find a way to keep the discs in the package and so that the discs do not get damaged.
1,i will not buy either,"I was looking forward to this dvd for a long time. In fact i was planning to go buy it tonight. I was so excited, because I think the first season of Roseanne was definitely the best. Then I come here and find out that the episodes are edited. So like the many other people whose reviews i read, even though I am extremely disappointed i will not buy it. I guess I will save my money and keep watching Nick at night and oxygen. i just went to Anchor Bay website and sent them an email. When they release the full unedited episodes, then I will buy it."
1,"Great show, but I won't be buying Season 1","EDITED?!?!? No thanks. I'd GLADLY pay for the original, uncut episodes on DVD (along with the ""Golden Girls"", ""Roseanne"" was/is one of my all time favorite TV series), but there is no way I'm going to buy this set.Someone at Anchor Bay should lose their job over this snafu. Seriously."
1,Syndicated episdoes = no $$$ from me,"I have tons of blank DVDRs and VHS tapes laying around the house. I can just record syndicated episodes off of cable TV. Why buy them? I wouldn't buy a book that is missing pages. Studios often re-release movies with ""extra footage"" or ""director's cut"" or ""extended edition"". How many do you think they would sell if they released a shortened version...like a Gone With the Wind that is only 2 hours long. I will no longer buy any DVD set with syndicated episodes. If the message is not sent to the studios right now, then they will ocntinue to take the cheap and easy path."
1,Edited Versions??,"If these are the edited versions, I will not purchase them. Chances are they will come out with a special edition or anniversary edition with the restored original versions. Why buy twice??"
5,Roseanne,I love Roseanne... I cannot wait until they release it!!!! I watch the show 4 times a day..it's on Nick @ Nite thank GOD!!! I just love this show I have watched it for years.. I laugh so much no matter HOW many times I watch the same show over and over.. :)
4,I Love Roseanne BUT...,"I Love Roseanne But These Are The Same Episodes I Watched On Nick At Night,Then I Started To Read All These Messages..The Episodes Are CUT?!?! Well I Wanted To See Uncut Episodes!! But I Didnt Buy My Copy Of Roseanne So The Company Didnt Get Any Money From Me! :D (lol)"
5,The Best Show Ever.,"This show had everything. Great acting from Roseann/Roseanne Barr/Roseanne Arnold/Roseanne Thomas/Roseanne Barr Pentland Arnold Thomas, John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf, Sara Gilbert, Lecy Goranson, Sarah Chalke, and Michael Fishman. The storylines were realistic and groundbreaking (particularly the episodes with Darlene's first period, Becky's birth control and DJ's masterbation) but always funny. Also, the ending was one of the most original, touching, and just plain great of any show before or since."
1,I hate it when this happens!,I just bought the DVD and it's the same with the Alf DVD. Sure it maybe a good menu of Rosanne but still it looks it has been edited. Wait till the official DVD comes out. This is not the official it's just an edited version of Rosanne that looks like it's been taped off TV probably a bootleg Rosanne.
5,FINALLY!!!!!!!,It is about time!!! I have been waiting years for this to be out. I got it the first day it came out and went home and watched it. There is hardly anything great on tv anymore I am just glad to know I can watch the smart mouth roseanne again! Can't wait to the Second season comes out.
2,Rossanne Season 1,it was shipped fast and the disc played well but it was missing one of the disc out of the set.
1,This show should've never been put on the air!,"I can't believe a whole lot of people on here like this show. To me, it's just a huge waste of time. All this show is is cussing, fighting, slamming doors, and screaming, which I consider very disrespectful behavior. If you're looking for good TV shows, don't waste your money on this DVD."
1,Mean spirited.,"I too saw Roseanne on the Carson(R.I.P. Johnny, we miss you)show and I thought she was the most abrasive,bitter and mean spirited comic I had ever seen. I hoped I would never see her again, but she got her own show and guess what? More of the same, bitter,mean spirited and abrasive junk. And people ate it up! I've never understood it and I doubt I ever will, my only explanation is their the same people who made that brainless piece of crap ""Fear Factor"" such a huge hit. Thank you for reading my review."
1,I wish I could give this the score ZERO Stars,I have watched this show a couple of times. But I hate it because Rosanne and Dan get in an argument just about every episode is the same. They get mad and cuss. I would definitley not buy this dvd if you paid me to buy it.
1,Edited=NOT Complete=Let it collect dust on the store's shelves...Do not buy!,"That about sums it up...just trying to keep the overall score low...If they are going to release edited versions, why not just include commercials, as well...since these are the versions we are seeing on TV...then maybe all these ""I'm buying it anyway, it's Roseanne"" morons will shut up, and realize, if you are going to waste $30, contact me and I will be glad to take that money off your hands..."
1,"Fabulous series, but a disgraceful DVD release","I think Roseanne was probably the greatest sitcom in history, and a fabulous show at it's peak (which was most of it's run). I've been looking forward to a DVD release for years. But I won't buy a set that has several minutes indiscriminately cut from every episode. The show has so many characters and so many overlapping storylines that I doubt scenes could have been snipped by the syndication company without affecting the story. And hey, I'm not going to fork over my moola just to get the same butchered version I can see for free on TV."
1,Edited - I won't buy!!!!,"Whyyy????? I've waited so long for this release and now the episodes are edited,very disappointing!!! I won't buy the DVDs until the complete version will be published!"
2,Roseanne - The Complete First Season,The DVD started freezing on the third episode. I took the DVD out of the tv and it had some foggy looking substance all over the DVD and after wiping it off it had tons of little scratches on it. This was brand new out of the package. The second disk in the set was the same except for this one did not skip or freeze up. I've never seen anything like it before but since I had opened the package I am stuck with it. I'm not happy with this at all - should have bought them from Best Buy like I usually do.
1,This is taking to long!!!,Will you hurry up already! My parents gonna be so worry it.I don't like what holds up like this. There are taking so long to wait for this.
1,The Fans Deserve Better!,"All involved with the release of this edited, syndicated set of ""Roseanne"" episodes should be ashamed of themselves, from Carsey-Werner, to Anchor Bay, to Roseanne herself. It shows such contempt of the fans to try and market a set of DVD's of the same episodes that can be viewed on any number of TV channels everyday. The whole point of TV on DVD is to get the COMPLETE episodes, as they originally aired. After skipping the chopped up versions of ""ALF,"" ""The Cosby Show,"" and now ""Roseanne,"" my TV on DVD purchases are getting pretty limited. The only way I'll ever own this set is if I buy it at a pawn shop or a yard sale, since I will not be responsible for fattening the wallets of those involved in this travesty."
1,An EDITED travesty,"You know the drill. Fans are rightly outraged. Releasing the EDITED, syndication episodes of ""Roseanne""'s first season is unacceptable. Anchor Bay is fighting a losing battle. Let them hear your complaints."
1,Shame on Anchor Bay Entertainment - Carsey/Werner!,"This is my #1 most anticipated DVD release of all time. It pains me to say I will NOT be buying it. I have the syndication edits on DVD from television. The box says the COMPLETE first season and it is not. 2 minutes removed from 23 episodes = 46 minutes of deleted footage. That is TWO EPISODES worth of missing footage.I encourage everyone to teach Anchor Bay Entertainment - Carsey/Werner that this sort of lazy, thoughtless product will not be tolerated by the fans.Do not buy this set until they can get their act together and release it properly."
1,Will not be buying this one,Just heard it was the cut version as shown on TV now....why buy the DVDs when I can look at this version for free. Sorry....won't spend 27 bucks for that when I am paying a cable bill for the same thing.
1,"brilliant show, WORTHLESS DVD !!","i cannot believe that they're releasing the syndicated, cut episodes of ""roseanne"" on dvd... if anybody wants to see the mangled syndicated versions, they can be seen on oxygen or nick-at-nite or a local affiliate on a daily basis for FREE.if we don't boycott this kind of ruined product, we'll never get seasons 2+ released the way they were originally written, shot, and broadcast. when fans put the pressure on rhino to release the second season of ""too close for comfort"" uncut after they'd released the first season cut -- guess what ? THEY RELEASED THE SECOND SEASON COMPLETELY UNCUT !so please, please, please -- if you are a fan of this show, DO NOT BUY THESE DVDs ! and let carsey-warner know why."
1,Unbelievable,"Wow. I was excited to be nearing the release date so that we could finally own the Roseanne DVD. Now I learn that these are the edited versions? There is no way I'm spending my money on this. What a disappointment. I'm a huge fan of the show, but I feel cheated in being offered butchered episodes. Maybe if enough of us hold on to our dollars, someone will get the hint and release the unedited version. Until then, I guess it's back to waiting and staying with Nick at Nite."
5,Roseanne,"I LOVE ROSEANNE! ALL THE CHARACTERS ARE WELL VERSED AND KEEP ME LAUGHING THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE SHOW. PLEASE GET THIS OUT ON DVD, MY VHS TAPES ARE GETTING BLURRY. I HATE THE SECOND BECKY. DARLENE AND ROSEANNE ARE MY FAVORITE BECAUSE THEY ARE REAL SMART BUTTS."
5,AMAZING!!!,I've been waiting for the release of roseanne for years! I was so happy to find it was being released and preordered it from america (im in UK) just to have it that month early! There may be cuts in it..(im not sure as my parents taped over all my episodes years ago...as i drove them mad watching it 24hours a day!) But even if there is cuts...it doesnt effect the fact that it is amazing! And definately worth the money!! BUY NOW!!! :)
5,An American treasure,"""Roseanne"" had a lot going for it besides being wildly funny...it was probably the most accurate portrayal of an average American family. Roseanne gave us REAL people with REAL problems instead of too-cute and precocious kids, a mom vacuuming in pearls, and a father who never takes off his tie. We saw real issues presented with humor, and parents who did their best and never stopped loving their kids even when life got messy. We could all relate. When ""Roseanne"" went off the air, its fans felt they'd lost a family member. Relive the memories, and share them with a new generation. Highly recommend this DVD, and I don't see anything missing as some other critics claim. If there's anything missing, it's having the wonderful Halloween episodes back to back!"
1,False Advertising,"Isn't it false advertising to advertise this set as being the ""complete Roseanne when it most certainly isn't? Wouldn't be nice to find an attorney and start some sort of action against the ones who released this and are blatantly lying to people to move product?If the editing doesn't bother you, fine - go buy it. They certainly won't get any more of my money though and I'll be sure to inform everyone I know to not buy this series."
1,To bad its edited....I was about to buy it...,until I read all this. I was beyond excited to hear about this set but as much as it pains me to say I will hold on to my dollars in protest of the edited set. I hope I will be able to stay strong and not buy this.
1,No stars for greed (But Amazon forces me to give it at least one) - this is not the Season One you remember seeing,"Carsey-Werner issues the edited first season, losing 2-3 minutes of each original episode. The reason??? In two years, they'll release the COMPLETE Season One and those who buy this set will be the owners of a lesser product. Watch the reruns on TV Land for free."
1,Syndication = BAD,"The reason I find this set revolting (though i LOVE the show) is because of the syndicated episodes they used instead of the real ones. I discovered that when they got the rights to put this on DVD, they only got the rights for the syndicated episodes of first season, as well as season 2. Season 2 will be the same. The reason they are using syndicated episodes is not only copyrights, but the fact that they needed to beable to synch in other languages with the music and sound effects for other countries. This is sad I realize, but we deserve much more, and companies who do this are just revolting. If you put a show on DVD put the actual thing, not something that was syndicated and never shown on TV."
1,"It's all been said, but....","I don't care. Whoever said these negative reviews will raise awareness is right! I was VERY excited to get this release until I found out about it being edited, syndicated versions. If we keep lowering the average score people won't get ripped off. Look, if you don't care about it being edited, good, go buy it. I, however, think this trend is dispicable. It's just like the music industry - the people putting these things out are NOT FANS and don't even take the time to make sure they are putting out what the fans want. The more people who boycott this release, the better chance this ugly trend will cease to continue! I will, however, still rent this from Netflix, but sorry Anchor Bay, you will not be getting my money on this release. Such a shame, what a wonderful show...."
1,I'm so sad,"I've been asking for years when this will come out on DVD. It's amazing at the shows that have come out on DVD but not Roseanne. When I learned a few weeks ago that it was coming out from my best friend (with whom I used to live and she had 8, yes 8 VHS tapes, no commercials of Roseanne and we used to watch them constantly--especially after a night of drinking!), I was giddy like a school girl. Now, however, hearing this from all of you makes me so sad! I hate corporate america and greedy tv execs! :("
1,No Wonder Roseanne Hated The Producers,"They are greedy, disgusting, horrible, money hungry people who don't actually care about pleasing their fans, like they claim, just about making as much money with the least effort possible.I am the biggest fan of ""Roseanne"" I know, and I've waited seven months to have the DVD, longer actually. I've waited years to have it on DVD, but seven months ago I found out that the DVDs were coming out and were gonna be made with love, so I marked August 30th on my calendar. I'm not buying it anymore of course. I dont' want edited episodes any more than I'd want the edited TV version of a great movie. And no true fan would want it either!Thank you for reading."
5,The Best Show Ever!,"Of all the sitcoms on DVD out there, I can't believe this one is not out yet! What are they waiting for!?! This show can make me laugh no matter what mood i'm in! It is so cleverly written and the cast is hilarious! I hope they decide to put it out on DVD soon!"
1,At Least Season Two Won't Be Butchered,"Don't buy this set. I guarantee you that it'll be rereleased uncut and whoever bought this bad set will have to shell out money for a good set, so don't waste the money now. Carsey Werner and Anchor Bay got our message and since season one was so low in the ratings, two is coming out uncut, so we can all dance for joy. In the meantime, this set is still just as bad and shouldn't be bought. You can save up your money for the uncut other eight seasons and wait for them to rerelease this. The reviewer from Israel said it very well, by noting specific parts that have been sliced out and how they affect the show."
3,"Fairly sturdy, loose calibration.","I've had this scale for 2 years. The calibration often is 1-2 lbs. off. If you step on the plastic part, it cracks easily.Other than that, this is a good budget scale."
1,Waste of Money,"The ""silver"" ring that is around the scale broke off the first day. It holds the plastic window on, so that is constantly falling off. The black surface is peeling off after only three months. The surface area is hardly big enough for my ladies size 7.5 feet. The accuracy is terrible. Mine is off at least 8 lbs for me and a 2-4 pounds for my young children. I can't think of anything good to say about this scale. I would not buy another Taylor brand scale again."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Had a digital scale which used up batteries too fast (I thought) and decided to go back to an analog. What a mistake! Instructions tell you to step on and off several times, recalibrating each time. The scale is off by 30 lbs. according to my doctor's scale (and my old digital scale). It might work fine for the first 100 lbs., but anything much over that, it isn't accurate at all. Waste of money ..."
5,Taylor Chrome Analog Scale,"This is a very nice looking, quality made scale and easy to read dial. I also received excellent service.Thanks..Mary"
4,More Mo please,"In the genre of blind sculptor-sleuths, Mo Bowdre stands alone. It's interesting that another author who uses a blind sleuth also had a Georgia O'Keeffe theme in a mystery. Both have their strong points. This is a pleasant read just for spending time with Mo and the inhabitants of his community. It's not the best of the Mo books, but it's a keeper for the time being. Mo uses his ability to think things out to solve local mysteries when he isn't creating powerful animal sculptures."
2,Curiosity,"Intermittently watchable, notable chiefly for its early inclusion of talented black performers in a major studio production (Hattie McDaniel from Gone With the Wind among them). They add life and fun to this musical, but alas, are absent for the last third. Paul Robeson was apparently taking a break from his unrepentant odes to Stalin, who himself was in the midst of his most prolific period of murdering millions (and enslaving countless millions more) of his countrymen -- all for the good progressive cause, of course."
5,Original Showboat 1936,"This is the best film version of showboat. Spendy but worth every penny. Cast includes Irene Dunne, Alan Jones, Paul Robeson. GOOD stuff"
1,Shocking!,"I don't normally bother writing reviews but feel I had to with this one.I was shocked. Not only was it poorly produced but it was very short.All my little boy learnt from this was how to pick your nose and wipe it on the table, how to blow bubbles through a straw, and how to say 'shut up'.Why on earth would the producers not highlight the 'correct' behaviours instead of focusing on wrong behaviours? I know it was meant to be a humourous way of highlighting what not to do, however when kids see behaviours (wrong or not) they copy them anyway!!Definitely only for much older kids, maybe 8-10yrs, but I wouldnt recommend it at all to be honest, not much to learn from it."
3,Short Story!,"Although the content is good, it is a very short video which is broken up into even shorter clips. The children were interested in it, but it doesn't cover much, and I would like to have seen more content without having to switch to different segments."
4,Great game video!,This is a great video. I created a powerpoint presentation to introduce this subject matter to our Children's church. The video works perfectly with my powerpoint presentation. I would definitely recommend it coupled with another presentation. Our children loved playing the game.
1,Not interesting enough!,"this video is not interesting enough to children, its like a game show and I wish it was more like episodes or a little story, my 5 year old only watched it once."
1,Piece of junk.,"Hardly ever worked. Jams, doesn't fire, poorly designed. What were they thinkin'? Waste of money. Now I have to buy yet another staple gun to complete an upholstery project. Previously had to junk an Arrow PowerShot, which also fell apart almost immediately. What is it with staple guns? Are they really meant to be one-time (or a few-time) use?"
1,Worst Tool Ever,Worst tool I have ever purchased. Insufficient power to reliably drive a 5/16 staple into plywood. Jammed ALL the time. Buy a pneumatic stapler for half the price and ten times the performance. Don't buy this.
2,Stopped working after two years,"I bought this stapler to build a couple of cat houses. After the 3rd cat house I built, it suddenly stopped working. 3 cat houses in 2 years?When it worked, however, it was ok. Like someone else said, you had to keep firmly or the staples would not go all the way in."
1,owned two...both broke,After contunuous use... both of my arrow staple guns...just stopped working.Really frustrating. I'm shopping around for another brand.
4,Great Book For Beginners,"Are you planning a hiking trip and not sure what to bring or what to buy? Well, this is the book for you. I found a lot of great tips and good advice from safety to how to build up to long hikes. Great Book !!!"
2,Okay,"I am a beginner hiker. I bought this book based on the price and recommendations from below. There isn't any information in this book that can't be found on hiking websites. I felt it was a waste of money. It wasn't bad, and if you know NOTHING about camping, it's a good place to start - but there are better resources out there."
3,Very Basic,"Although there were a few things that I learned from this book, it's full of info that can be found virtually anywhere else. It didn't go into detail about certain things and raised more questions than it answered."
4,Great timesaver ... a must for professionals,"If you run a lot of coax, you need this tool. I install cable television, so needless to say, I run a lot of wire during the day. This tool cuts the time it takes me to run a line almost in half. Instead of hammering in individual staples, just point and shoot. Pretty much the only surfaces it won't staple into are metal, asbestos siding, and concrete/stucco. I only wish it could hold more staples at a time. It's also a little on the pricey side, and I almost didn't buy it because it's so expensive. But having used it, I'd say it was definitely worth the investment. It's earned a permanent place in my tool belt."
5,T59,"Used to ""clean up"" some of the loose security,phone & network wiring around the basement just like the famous T50 it is built like a tank."
5,Time saver,Worked great! It has the occasional misfire but what staplers don't.Perfect for Cat5 & cat 6 wire. Get it!
4,nice,i choose this rating because it was alittle damage but i can fix because im scared it want be back in time for my wedding. i like the heaviest and color of it. it was ivory like my colors but i dislike the horse tail was chipped on both just better handling FRAGILE ITEMZ.
4,unity candle,"Great Product, arrived on time and was what it was describedas. Already reviewed it once before. Not sure why I have to review this product again?"
4,DON'T GIVE UP ON THIS SERIES!,"I really would rate this book a 3 3/4 because of the world building and background information on the cyborgs but it is totally misleading of how great the series really is.If I had read this book first instead of CYBORG NATION, I probably would not have stayed with the series. In fact, I recommend that people start with the 5th in the series TOTAL RECALL and then read from CYBORG NATION on.Please read my review of CYBORG NATION for more information and recommendations. Don't give up on the series until you read at least CYBORG NATION!"
1,My review,I was disapointed with this book. The plot line was interesting in the Production Review and I was on a Sci Fi trip after reading Laurann Dohner Cyborg series (which I Loved) I thought why not try this. I felt the plot line was there for the book but the writing and dialogue were lacking big time. Its one of those books where you feel like you could have done a better job writing it. I just wanted more. Not the length but better dialogue with the charchters and more depth to the storyline especially since it's the first book of the series. I finished this book thinking it could have been so much more which left me disapointed.
3,Mostly Sci-Fi and just a little bit dry.,"This was an OK read but I'm not sure I can recommend it. Here's what I do know. I surfed around Amazon and sort of stumbled upon this genre. I was kind of expecting it to be more erotic with the benefit of sci-fi expanding the possibilities and parameters of what would occur. That's not so much the case here. It is mostly ""world-building"" with somewhat mild (or at least not that hotly written) sexual and relationship matters thrown in. I guess I was expecting ""cyborgs"" to be extreme/intense but it just never got that far. Still, I'd go so far as to say that if you're into science fiction and are not expecting too much, you may like this."
3,Had potential,"I love the world building and re-imagination of this cliché, but I'm sad to see the author fell short of writing a great story. The romance between Reuel and Dalia was stiff and awkward, and Pierce had so much potential but never reached it. The characters could've used more fleshing out, and a lot of pages were sacrificed in favor of setting the environment, that the triangle suffered for it.The sequels get better though, so I'm glad I didn't let this installment turn me off of the entire series."
4,different,"if you like more story than erotica, this is a good one. i got lost in a lot of the technical stuff... actually fd myself skipping pages. also...use english right please... sole (one and only) and soul...etc"
2,I'm not always the problem,"Though this book has much to recommend it, for the reader who is hurting for reasons other than themselves being the problem, it could be damaging. We are supposed to struggle - and we grow through those struggles. And Matzat has some good things to offer about thinking properly and scripturally. But his oft-repeated, ""I am the problem"" is not explained in a balanced manner. I don't quite get his ""we're not here, we're in heaven with Jesus"" point either. At times he seems to have gnostic tendencies. I might recommend it to someone who reads a lot to inform their thinking or leadership, but I wouldn't likely recommend it to someone in pain."
5,Good stuff for the entire faily.,"Gilligan's Island is a great old TV show. It's is safe for kid's and doesn't contain all the junk you get with todays TV, so it's great for adults, too. It is just plain old funny, slap-stick type comedy with no ulterior motives or heavy, ""makes you think"" plots. I wish there were more shows on like this today."
4,Season 2 isn't missing an episode,"One reviewer mentioned there was a missing episode - #69 ""Up At Bat"". That was the first episode for Season 3. You will get it...but it will cost you another $27."
1,What a huge step backwards!,"I can't believe Warner is actually reissuing these with 6 1-sided discs, when originally they were 3 2-sided discs! I just ordered the old version while it's still in stock! I always thought being able to put material on both sides of the disc was one of the coolest things about DVD ever since the format came out, even when I was skeptical about its quality!Of course, Warner didn't help matters by getting rid of the printing on side 2 of their later discs. There were enough complaints about the small labels on 2-sided discs without doing away with them on one side completely!"
3,Complete very misleading.,"As an avid fan of this show, I am highly disappointed that several of the best episodes are not included on this dvd set. Therefore it is not complete.Where is the episode where Gilligan thinks he is turning into a vampire, or the one where Maryann thinks she is Ginger. Where Ginger is Eva Grubb, where Gilligan is Dr.Jekell and Mr. Hyde. Where Harold Heckuba visits the island... come on, whats up with this?I do hope these and several others I have not mentioned will come out at a later date. So until then, this set is absolutely not complete."
5,even better than I remember,I'm 46 and have enjoyed seeing this with my 7 year old son. He thinks it a riot and I get a kick out of it too. They don't make them like that anymore!
5,Happy memories,"My grandson cried when he received this video to complete his ""set"" of Gilligan's Island series."
2,Wrong Handle,"I purchased needle files and this handle was a recommended from amazon. I though that it would be a small handle for needle files, it was not it is even too big for my seven inch files. Amazon should look at what they are recommending before they say this works with that. The handle seems to grasp the file tang OK."
5,Change is in the air,"I have to say I am glad Andy decided to go solo for this album. I was very suprised at the non-erasure sound to it...Don't get me wrong I love Erasure but sometimes the same sounds over and over tent to get a little boring...I love this cd...tracks 1,2,3,4,and 6 are my fav's but they are all good.Go get this album!!!"
3,Acceptable Solo Effort,Having been a Erasure fan for the last 20 years (yes that long) I was pleased to see that Andy bell has after all this time released a solo album. This is definitely NOT an Erasure album and maybe I am stuck in a rut and that is why it fails to 'fly' for me. I have enjoyed the disc and there are some great moments but I really couldn't recommend it to anyone and I have to admit I am amazed some of the other reviewers consider it an album of dance music. Andy Bell has real talent and is always amazing to see live but for me the best parts of this CD are the parts that smack of Erasure and I am sure that is NOT what was intended here.
2,Listen to this CD before you buy it!,"I've been a big fan of the group Erasure for quite some time now. I've followed their career even when their sound was fading away. One of the main reasons I followed so closely is because I love their synth'zr SOUND that made them famous. When I heard Andy Bell would be coming out with a solo CD, I was excited because I thought his voice would carry his solo project without a problem, WRONG! This album is pure garbage. I always sample new CDs when they come out. On this CD I thought I was safe in buying it. I was sadly disappointed. There's not one song that keeps me interested. Sadly to say, I found myself skipping through every song. Now, I will have to put this CD up for sale here on AMAZON. I've played this CD twice hoping it would grow on me but so far it hasn't. All I'm saying is SAMPLE this CD before you buy it. I still love Erasure :)"
1,A total disappointment,"My first complaint is that none of these badly written, whipped up songs showcase Andy's great voice. I can't believe this is the same guy who poured his heart and soul on nightbird (a fantastic album by the way.) This cd was purely made for the clubs with no real feel to it at all. Larsen and Smith can not compare to the genius known as Vince Clarke. Maybe I'm just spoiled with all of my erasure albums but I expected more from the one of the best singers in the world."
3,Caution when buying! Not Erasure.,"The first time I listened to the whole cd I thought to myself, what the hell is going on? The music is good, the singing is good, so why does the cd feel like it isn't a masterpiece? It hit me while driving to work and listening to it...the music does not challenge Andy's voice. You can sure tell which song's feel legitimately Andy Bell, and that is Crazy, Runaway, I'll Never Fall in Love Again, and maybe Delicious. It has a disco feel to it, which is kinda good, and kinda what, iffy? I love Andy and Vince, and usually anything they touch is gold. If Andy was to read this, I would tell him don't give up on his solo albums though. They have something, they just need to polish it up, and put more effort in the lyrics to the songs...""a pain in my feet?"" Maybe re-think Claudia Brucken."
5,You will never be the same,This video explains the crucifixion forensically and makes you truly aware of the extent of the suffering of Jesus Christ. The passion and death readings of scripture take on a deeper meaning and you are more deeply aware of the sacrifice. The amazing part is that He knew it and willingly accepted this price for each of us.
5,Very Good Analysis,"Despite a few errors based on how Jesus was actually nailed through the wrists, not the hands, the movie is very interesting and gives a good feel for the real pain that Christ undertook. More people should now about the medical facts which make Jesus' death inevitable, and his empty tomb and linens, a revelation to new life in Him."
1,disappointed,"The video was too technical. I expected a re-enactment of what Jesus' experience may have been during the last 18-hours leading to his death and then resurrection, but what I saw instead was a bunch of medical interpretations of what was happening to him physically. I know that he suffered immensely for our sins and for that I am thankful. Because of him their is hope of eternal life for mankind. I would have liked to see a storyline and not a bunch of medical supposition. I was truly disappointed."
2,Disappointment,"I found this to be very disappointing. It was 35 minutes of medical talk that has been heard before. I also found it expensive. After I purchased it and reviewed it, I saw it on the Internet for $10.00 cheaper. I learned that Amazon does not always have the best deal. I feel like I wasted $30."
4,Thank you Cheri!,"As I look back on our journey, raising two children born to us and six intercountry adopted children, I can see myself in various of Cheri's chapters. The clarity she provides, when coupled with the words of our adult adoptees, is something every adoptive parent needs. This book should be required reading."
5,Excellent book,"Must read for all adoptive parents with children of other races or cultures. But, this book goes beyond international or transracial adoption and addresses issues that apply to all adoptive families."
4,Lot's of great stuff,"Compiled by FÜXA frontman and Mind Expansion owner Randall Nieman. Features 32 songs, half EXCLUSIVE to this CD, from some of the most ground breaking, and influential groups over the past 20+ years on 2 cd's. Groups include: SPACEMEN 3, MARTIN REV (SUICIDE), TELESCOPES, KIM FOWLEY, TEENAGE FILMSTARS, FUXA, MAZARIN, PIANO MAGIC, PAPER (LANDING), MARKUS, UNKNOWN CELEBRITIES, MAGNETOPHONE, ELEVATOR (ex-ERIC'S TRIP), LANDING, DEAN WAREHAM and BRITTA PHILLIPS (ex-GALAXIE 500/LUNA), LARGENUMBER (ex-ADD N TO X), OUTRAGEOUS CHERRY, SPRING REVERBS, LANDIS, TEX LA HOMA, TELEVISE (ex-SLOWDIVE), IMAJINARY FRIENDS, UNISEX, AMP, UNEXPLAINEDTRANSMISSIONS, BARDO POND, VENTURE LIFT, TRANSIENT WAVES, LSD AND THE SEARCH FOR GOD, FREELOVEBABIES, GRAVITY WAX and PAIK."
4,A World of Earrings,"The book is beautifully illustrated with full color photos that are exceptional in quality. I think it would have been helpful to show how some of the earrings are actually worn, either on a mannequin head or a real person. One other feature I found inconvenient was the location of the descriptive text , which is clear at the back of the book, instead of under or in back of each illustration. The reader has to keep flipping back and forth between the full-sized photo in front and the text at the end. However, it still provides a good general survey of ethnic earrings from Africa, Asia and the Americas."
1,Fried and fried everything plugged into it,"This product fried (strong burn smell, soot around all plugs) at the time of an electrical ""event"" that also took out my stove, wall oven, garage door opener and hot tub. At the time of the event, I had 4 surge protectors. Here is what happened with each:Belkin BE107200-06 (this one): fried and fried all units plugged into it even though they were not on. Lost Sony Blu-Ray player, Sony CD player, MS Xbox, and Verizon Set top box (which was in standby so technically it was on).Belkin F5C050-TEL: Ok, but DELL computer plugged into it that was on at the time is fried.IIIWoods 5196: fried (burn smell, no soot) but all units plugged into it and on at the time are fine.Another Belkin unit (plugged into the IIIWoods) survived.I'm not at all happy with Belkin at this point, and particularly not happy with the BE107200-06"
4,Adequate for the price,"This seems to be an adequate surge protector for the price, of course I won't know for sure until it is needed."
1,Plastic Clip broke free flooding cabinet after 13 months use.,"The faucet works fine, but the under-counter spray connection gave away after 13 months causing it to flood under the cabinet when the faucet is turned on. This is a small plastic clip that connects the under-handle brass threaded pipe to the flexible hose that runs up to the spray head. There is no movement at this point of the connection - yet it gave away. After re-inserting the clip, it pops free when full water pressure is on. The plastic seems to have weakend over time and cannot stay in place under pressure. All the good of this faucet is totally negated by the cheap connector breaking free and flooding the base cabinet. I cannot recommend this faucet to anyone."
2,Buy the Kohler Instead,"I bought this because it had two attachment points to the sink and my installation was to a lopsided old stainless corner sink at my dad's house. Although it fit my application, my Kohler that's similar to it is made significantly better. The faucet is not very high, made rather cheaply and functions poorly with the pullout hose, which I had to jury-rig with more weight for it to function properly. I would never purchase it again."
1,"looks good, but is bad","DO NOT BUY - this faucet looked good and seemed a bargain. The design is very nice to look at, but the mechanics are very poor. Within a few weeks it got harder and harder to turn it all the way off without drips. Then it started getting harder and harder to rotate. It's now a year old, and we are shopping for a replacement.The problem seems to be the design, where hot and cold are adjusted (diagonally side to side) in the same movement as water flow (forward and back). There is no defined position where the flow is reliably OFF. My office had these in all the break rooms and the bathrooms, and they all constantly drip. They had to replace every one of them.We are buying another brand, where hot and cold is a rotating movement INDEPENDENT from the flow control (front to back)."
5,"Bought 3 of these so far - best design, works great!","I hate faucets whose sprayers look like you will need to grab an anatomical part to wash dishes, so I love the sleek modern design of this faucet. This is the third one I have bought. The first one was for a house we sold earlier this year (2008). When I asked our plumber (in 2002) to install it he grumbled about the brand, but by the time he had completed the install, even he had to admit it seemed like a good piece. The faucet survived my teenage son's and his friends' heavy use, and it kept looking and working great. When we renovated our new house I did not hesitate to buy another for that home. We have since bought a small condo in the city that is in need of a new kitchen faucet. This third purchase was for that installation, which we haven't done yet. I believe the item has gotten better since my first purchase - the sprayer seems more substantial; I have no doubt it will last a long time and give great service."
5,Very informative and motivating,Mr. Gates did a great job of showing the truth about Blacks. Mr. Gates' video should be shown to all Black and white students. It should be reguired for all class levels.
1,what a waste!,"Lynn Davis, I apologize. Your pictures are ok. Nothing outstanding, but surely good work. But Mr. Gates, how can a Harvard professor waste an opportunity of doing some real research about his subject. Everybody in REAL love for Africa was sighing: Another opportunity gone. Mr. Gates is superficial and has a touristic view, which is so often found in descriptions of ""my africa"" since centuries. There are hundreds of better books available!by the way, his PBS series is worse, demonstrating clearly his often neo-colonial point of view."
3,Good But Basic,"This is a solid desk reference for less experienced product managers. If you have many years of experience, you may find this book somewhat basic."
3,Reasonable Overview For Beginners,I purchased several books on Product Management to help my team improve our product development and launch process. I am a little surprised that there seems to be few books available on Product Management.I found this book to be the best among a disappointing selection. It provides an adequate overview for beginners and intermediate skilled people in software product development. It is useful in that it provides some guidance to help build a product management process where one does not exist.However I don't think it provides sufficient depth that a team with limited skills should expect that it provides sufficient information. The templates were disappointing and of little value (great templates would have raised my rating by at least a star.)I suggest you supplement this book with other books (if you can find them) and an experienced team member or outside consultant.
5,Great stuff but a question,"The Furs are a great band and this is probably their best album.My question is this: what is R. Butler saying at the end of Pretty in Pink? I catch a little of it (""other kinds of uniform...you can be what you want to be--until tomorrow"" but not a whole lot). And what the hell is the song about? I realize Caroline is used by a bunch of men but is she dead? What does she mean when she turns around and says this is the end of the joke? Please e-mail me with any answers."
3,18 gauge nailer,This has misfired or double fired a couple of times and other times works great. I am hesitant to use it where it would be very visible or where touchup would be difficult (like stained material).
2,BP,"Not a professional quality tool. OK for a home owner, Not all the nails get set, I waste to much time resetting nails. Air exhaust blows at operator.Good price, but I should of spent the extra dollars and purchased a name brand."
4,"Great book, but not advanced enough for me","I've worked with Flash for years now and I'll say this. The tips in this book are certainly intended for novice to intermediate users, which I am not. Honestly, it doesn't seem like the book makes any efforts to focus on advanced users, thus I gave it 4 stars for that and the writing style which I enjoyed. The author is self-deprecating in a charming fashion. However, I can't escape the fact that the book was presented by the publisher as a book of tips for advanced users and hence my disappointment. Buy this book if you'd rate yourself from 1 to 6 of 10 on Flash knowledge, but if you're an expert there's no need."
1,Useless information even for a Flash novice like me,"Here's the killer tip - don't get this book. It proves you can get anything published if you come up with a good title. There is absolutely nothing killer about any of the so-called tips, many of which are just commentary or ads presented as ""Hey, look, I just gave you another great tip."" If you are completely new to using computers you might learn the most basic fundamentals of how any application works, like clicking on things to select them, or that you can reposition windows. Ooo, wow! Flash's built in online help covers every topic here without the trouble of thumbing through this waste of paper. And the author's overbearing self-absorbed tone makes it all the worse. There are plenty of good Flash books at Amazon, get one of them but avoid this one."
1,It does not work,"This vise does not lock down to any surface. It is useless. I've tried to attach it to various surfaces, but no luck. Do not buy this vise, you will have to return it."
3,"Good Vise, Bad Base","I use this vise at work and I intend to purchase one for my shop, but wouldn't unconditionally recommend it. The vise is excellent, but the vacuum base is worthless. If you drill some holes and permanently mount the vise then you'll have a good tool. If you try and use the vacuum base then you'll have a bad doorstop."
1,5 stars for the chutzpah to sell it.,"How on earth they have the nerve to sell this thing. Eight dollars plus shipping, so it is too much trouble to send back. This is a piece of plastic that sticks to the Ipod and leaves bubbles to see the programs through. I ended up w/ a case I found at BestBuy that'll do the job of protecting the screen and the chassis."
1,Too many bubbles,The protector does not apply smoothly and leaves tiny bubbles. I acheived a better result using seran wrap.
1,Terrible,I received this product in the mail and after to days of scratch free protect the sticker collected dirt and fell off. If you want scratch free protection break down and by a cover.
1,Looks nothing but a piece plastic to me.,"This is my first review on amazon.I am frankly stunned too see the piece of sticker,plastic that I got after paying 13$.I have absoluterly no idea how they guys can claim a piece of sticker protects your ipod from scratches.Only time will tell if this thing promises to do the Job it claims it does.Folks this looks and is very much the piece of plastic you peeled of the IPOD's face when you bought it and took it out of the case."
2,okay job,It's true the scratch protector does leave annoying bubbles but it protects the face...for a bit. Now (after about two months or so) the edges don't stick anymore and it's starting to flake off so now I need new ones...or a new way to protect my ipod.
1,Garbage,Don't waste your money. This cover adheres to the ipod very poorly. You'll never get the bubbles out of it. Pure rip off.
4,Used in college course,I'm taking a visual basic class at my local community college this semester and we're using this book. I really like it and it's laid out well and is particularly good for looking things up when you need a reference guide. There's a program at the end of each chapter (they give you the full source code along with the psuedocode and form design so that you can create it all yourself). There have been a few minor mistakes that we've found but otherwise the book is excellent for learning VB.
2,Not good for online classes,"I am currently an online student at a local university. I attempted a class using this book. Another reviewer put it beautifully, ""the book doesn't explain how it got the code listed at the end of the chapter"" and understanding how to get there could prove to be a long night! While I've never programmed before except playing with some basic programs as a kid, I felt confident I could pass the class with work and dedication. I spent more than twice as much time online than I would have taking a campus class and still didnt' ""get"" it. Because I've been able to achieve success in other subjects that aren't my strong suits, I feel that the blame must rest with the book and the lack of continuity in the exercises. In fact, I noticed that the class will be using a different book this fall. Wonder why?!If you've programmed before, then this book might be okay; if not---don't attempt to learn with this one."
3,This book was also used in a college course I had...,"This book is only good for getting your feet wet with VB.NET... it gives you lil intros into different aspects of .NETI would recommend getting a different book, I just dont think its worth the money for the amount of information you get (not much)"
2,Not good for teaching yourself,"This textbook is lousy if you are using it to teach yourself. The book gives snippets of sample code, but it is difficult for the reader to start coding a project using these samples because they are too isolated and they do not build one upon the other to give a sense of continuity. At the end of each chapter a large amount of code is printed. This is the solution, but how the reader gets to that solution can be quite a problem. I doubt if the authors tested the manuscript on potential students, the sycophantic blurb on the back cover notwithstanding.I found a much better book with which to teach myself: ""Visual Basic .NET Step by Step"", 2nd edition, by Michael Halvorson, Microsoft Press. This book lives up to the ""Step by Step"" in its name. You cannot get lost following it."
5,Couldn't be happier!,I was so happy when The Book of Kells arrived. I was so worried that I would not like the condition of the book for the amount of money that I spent. I was so wrong...this was one of the best purchases I have ever made and the service was great!
1,Returning this one,"This seat protector does not live up to it's description. I purchased it to protect our leather seats. First of all, the back is too low to protect the seat back in a forward facing seat. Secondly, the underside of the protector is somewhat slick and so decreases the friction securing the car seat. Thirdly, the front flap (where the storage pockets are)is not long enough, so the top opening to the pockets is under the car seat and so useless ('08 Highlander). And finally, it is NOT waterproof/spill proof. This is the kicker, as my daughter had an accident that inevitably leaked through her seat to the ""protector"" below. The liquid seeped through the material of the ""protector"" onto the leather seat where it then left a blueish mark from the dye on the material making up the ""protector"". What I really should do is make the company pay to replace the leather on my seat. DO NOT BUY."
1,Does not work,"Could never get this to work, to stay in place that is. Just kept sliding out on my leather seats."
2,Not Long Enough,Nice neutral color. It makes my car seat move around a lot. Can't use the pockets because it's not long enough. The pockets are completely under the car seat.
5,Just what I wanted.,"Most of the Cayenne pepper I see in the local store is just for the color and not spicy. So I ordered just one bottle. This cayenne is indeed hot, but not very hot to the point of gulping down gallons of water in a state of shock. It has a very nice red also. This fine powder flows very smooth too. It would blend in a spicy stew if that's what you what. Unless the receipe is a spicy one, I would allow not sprinkle this on the food, but use it as a condiment. But I love spicy food, so next time I will be ordering a few bottle at a time."
4,tree kit,"These are better than what I was hoping for. They take a lot of time to put together. For me, 2 weeks to assemble all 16. Plenty of foliage in the package. Disappointed only one color of foliage in my package, I thought there were going to be two.These look great in my layout."
3,Great Music -- Terrible Vocals,"This gets the same review as their first CD. The music is really very good.Production could be better. But, the vocals are not very good at all. They really need to think about getting a different Lead singer. I start really getting into the song and the singer opens his mouth and ruins the whole thing. Its not the lyrics; its the voice."
3,Good effort not up to his first solo project.,"Defintitly a good cd. I couldln't decide whether to give it 3 or 4 stars. I used to have this and LET THE MUSIC DO THE TALKIN in cassette form, but it has been a while so I gave both a fresh listen.This has a hard rock sound but misses the Aerosmith feel. Sounds like an ""average"" heavy metal band as opposed to the rock legend from Aerosmith."
3,Uneven album,"A good CD, but has so many weak spot for my taste. THe opener "" EAST COAST WEST COAST"" is amazing. In general, it gives pleasure to listen."
4,"Good Book, don't take it too seriously","This book is quite amusing. At some parts I'm sure it's true for many men, but the constant assertions that it's true for ALL men are ludicrous. I've got a secret I'll share, controlling your sex drive is not difficult, AT ALL. Men only pretend it is so they can shift blame from themselves. Further, some men needn't have self control at all, because not all men like sex. Yes, this is true, my brother has lost several girlfriends over the fact that he is only interested in platonic relationships. Obviously this is extreme but it shows that end of the spectrum exist. Don't think I didn't like this book though, it's quite a fun read, but just don't take it so seriously, as many of the reviewers on here clearly did."
2,Oh for crying out loud.,"This books not only ignores the existence of such little known qualities as ""self control"", it ignores the existence of homosexuals.How very enlightened."
2,"Interesting, But Disheartening","I am always interested in the different ways mens' and womens' brains are wired, but this book just made me never want to be intimate with a man again."
1,I wouldn't want my real name attached to this book either!,"What a pitiful excuse for a book-Clearly designed to make a buck. Basically, these ""anonymous"" authors believe men are little more than animals when it comes to sex. While some men are like that, they stereotype all men- saying no exceptions, etc. The only men these guys can talk about for certain are themselves and maybe their creepy friends. I pity any woman who gets involved with them, they are the only ones that I hope do read this book!"
2,"authors were in a vicious business, buying into its toxic lifestyle","I know one of the authors, who is now completely changed and embarrassed about having co-autored this book. He left Hollywood, spent years in meditation and now leans towards Buddhism and community service. The ideas expressed in the book are true for those in the self-destructive world of power characteristic of Hollywood, where appearance is the prime value and excessive drug use common. It almost killed him.(please do not publish my name)"
2,Men in Hollywood Are Perverts Anyway,"Such statements don't surprise me from men in Hollywood--I was formerly pursuing acting but stopped because I got sick of the leachery. So now I'm pursuing writing -- they can't see what I look like. Men in Hollywood have HUGE egos--they think it is their RIGHT to screw every attractive woman that they see. Sorry, this is crap, there are SOME men out there who love their wives and are faithful to them. Men in Hollywood are horndogs because they have a lot of money and they like to wield power over women because of their influence."
3,I hope it's satire,"If it's intended as satire, this book is screamingly funny. If it's not, however, it's yet another iteration of the same old excuse: men just can't help it, they're victims of their raging testosterone; so, ladies, if you tempt them, you shouldn't be shocked at the consequences. (It's a rerun of the line I was fed in Catholic school: if a man lusts after you, you must have done something to ""provoke"" it.)There's a myth (beloved by political cartoonists) that ""man-hating feminists"" (i.e., fat women in bad haircuts, Birkenstocks, and slogan T-shirts) are trying to destroy heterosexual relationships in this society. In fact, it's adolescent cr*p like this that's far more damaging, perpetuating the idea that Real Men Are Lustful and Real Women Learn to Live With It. ""My hormones made me do it"" is no excuse -- and that holds for you, too, Bill."
5,"Surprisingly good book, really helped me out",This book did something I didn't expect it to: it really helped me and my boyfriend talk through some problems that I knew existed but had never pinpointed. Now I see why I was told to buy this book -- it really helps (although not for the faint of heart!)
1,women think the same things,"A friend gave me this book,thinking because I'm a woman,I may need it to explain men to me. For starters,no two men or two women are alike. Men are not the only people with spontanious sexual thoughts...and the men who wrote this book should be ashamed for damaging their gender to such an extent! Waste of good paper!"
5,"FINALLY, THE TRUTH!","Thank you so much for the truth, it did not hurt, it just WOKE ME UP!!! I just bought it yesterday and spent about two hours reading it cover to cover. I am a Psychology major and a student at Oregon State University. My specialty of study is, of course, Men and Men, Women and Relationships. With all the books I have to read, it's a relief to get the truth in such compact form. It's like Deepak Chopra's Seven Spiritual Laws. I eagerly look forward to reading the next book from Smith and Doe."
1,What Stupid People Don't Already Know,"This book is perfect for men who have an elevated ego. As an advice book, it is a total DUD. Real women already know what's in this book and don't need to bother reading it. I would have given it no stars, but that option was not availible!"
1,boring!,has the potential to be really funny...but it drags on and on and on! Obviously their publicist holds all the talent!
5,Checked his net worth,"This book is funny and very true, but there is a chapter on a man and his money that was very telling for me. I did what they said and found out that my boyfriend, who lives a lavish lifestyle, is totally leveraged to the hilt on credit cards, etc. This is a bad sign and I don't want to spend my life with someone with these tendencies. This alone made this book worth my while. Very funny!"
5,Our sex life has never been better!,"After reading this book, and after the shock and dismay wore off, I confronted my husband. He admitted that most things in the book were true, but most importantly we began communicating about his need for sex in ways we never had before. This book opened up a floodgate of things he wanted to tell me but never had because he was scared I would be turned off, etc. In my heart I believe that although I trust and love my husband, he would have eventually cheated. Kudos to Smith and Do!!!"
1,"Guys get a REALITY check, not a defensive ego trip","Women are a lot better at hiding it. Also a women's desire is EXCLUSIVELY linked to a man's innocense and honesty. Anything less than immpeccable perfection in this area leads to zero desire in the female. Women all have to act. A man writing this just wants to excuse his behavior. Scientific fact is that a male cheats if he even accidentally glances at any female. Anything more is carrying out what has been allowed to begin. It is imperitive that a guy is not exposed. It is equivalent to his girl doing everything with another guy for a long period of time. Besides in reality, NO female is truly attracted to older guys. Guys that are like 18-22 which are fair, muscular, have nice voices, don't conceal information(lie), etc. are the most desired. Guys, get a REALITY check, not a defensive ego trip."
1,"Trash, trash, trash.","Why shouldn't you believe what the authors have to ""reveal"" in this book? Because, according to his own bio on the dust jacket, one of them is a recovering sex addict with 4 (at last count) failed marriages. Getting advice about male sexuality from this source is like asking a prostitute about female sexuality, or asking a homeless alcoholic about the healthful effects of a glass of wine with dinner. Don't waste your time or your money on this drivel."
1,We're not all the same... There are good men out there.,"I read this book after my girlfriend read it. She said she ""felt alienated"" and she stopped trusting me. After reading it myself, I was reminded of a previous experience with theories about men and sex. Freud believed that the desire to have sex with ones mother and kill one's father formed the ""permanent stock of the psychic impulses which arise in early childhood."" When I first read Freud, I was completely baffled by his theory. I couldn't imagine where he came up with it, until I discovered that he himself had lustful dreams of his mother. The moral of the story: don't take the advice of an overgeneralizing pervert."
1,amusing parnoia,"Reminds of the woman at a woman's college that said it was a good thing for a man to be falsly accused of rape becuase it would be a learning experience. Only 3.6% of men are faithfull? Another case of woman good, man bad. Lies. Check out The Myth of Male Power for the truth."
2,ugh...,"Read it if you want to be paranoid . If the stuff in it IS true, we're all in big trouble. It's kind of funny the way it's written but it won't make you want to go out and get a man."
1,What women don't want men to know...,"...because it's not as socially acceptable as men cheating on their wives and/or girlfriends:Well, Smith and Doe, this may come as a shock to you, but there are also women who actually - God forbid!! - cheat on their husbands and boyfriends.It does happen, you know. Although I guess a lot of people, whether they're knee-jerk feminists who believe that all women are good and all men are rotten, or men with over-inflated egos like yourselves, don't like to admit it.It's interesting that there are not more books written about women who stray on their husbands. I guess it's because they would destroy our society's idealized images of men as these unfeeling, insensitive, oversexed clods and women as these frustrated, long-suffering martyrs who stay home while their men have all the fun.Men - and women, too (gasp!) - have been cheating on their spouses since the world began.Wake up and smell the coffee,- Rosalind Lord"
1,ALL MEN SHOULD BE ASHAMED BY THESE AUTHORS,"This book actually made me ill! Guys out there......... these two author wanna-a-be's (of course they were too ashamed to use their names)have given the name pig to all men. They claim that there is not one good man out there, and if there is, he's puts on a very good front. He has belittled men more than any male-bashing woman ever could. Ladies out there.......don't waste your money on this piece of pure garbage. This book was definitely written to ruin many good relationships. They state that no man can be trusted and that all men want nothing more than sex........ (even when their wives are in intensive care, they WILL stop to check out a girls cleavage, according to these two clowns). If you and your man share the beautiful gift of love, your man won't want anything more that you. P.S. I BOUGHT THIS BOOK TO GET A FEW LAUGHS WITH MY GIRLFRIENDS. BOY WERE WE IN FOR A REAL SURPRISE.*** A DEGRADING PIECE ...... FOR MEN AS WELL AS THE WOMEN WHO LOVE THEM."
4,Interesting,"It strikes me as a bit ""highbrow"" and even a bit pretentious in parts (then again, I'm a layperson - not a psychologist), but May does give an interesting analysis of some of the potential social causes of feelings of disatisifaction and emptiness experienced by so many in the modern western world. Despite the highbrow tone taken in parts, May does seem like a nice down-to-earth man who believes more love and positive self-direction can remedy most of the psychological discontent we experience."
5,a great lesson to our mind,"This book reminds us that modern life and its emphases on superficial things such as technology and technicality can bring the age of anxiety, diordered will and therefore schizoid world. Human behaviors become more and more avoidant, either by detachment or pathological acting out, and participation in introspection and interpersonal relationships become a rare concept. He presents Eros, Daimonic, and intentionality as a way of deepening the meaning of love and will. The book is relatively easy read, not too theoretical, author's vast application of mythology and epistemology adds more dimension and fun as well. Very insightful and relevant to our time where human nature is frequently exploited, and trivialized."
3,Tres Reyes plus,"Recently I bought Lo Mejor de los Mejor (the best of the best) of Los Tres Reyes, inspirational music, specially the performance and virtuosity os such gifted guitar players, however I felt cheated with the last three songs in volume two. I was expecting Los Tres Reyes only, how come this three poorly recorded songs were selected instead of few terrific hits such as Alma Mia, Cuando tu te Hayas Ido, Como un Duende, Jacarandosa. I almost wanted my money back. It is possible for Amazon to re-issue the volume two including the mentioned songs and send it to my address, in a sense your product is faulty. Remember you reputation is on the line. Yours, Marco Ramirez, Australia"
4,Thought Provoking,"This book deals with the importance of the Holy Land to different religious and political groups from a Christian perspective (Catholic). It deals with the topics in a very thought-provoking way, juxtaposing the Kingship of God vs. the man-kings that the ancient Jews desired and the importance of the ancient temple(s).A good read."
3,Declining quality,"Joe Queenan is a magazine journalist and this becomes apparent in his book. Whilst he can be exceptionally funny, he loses steam with each additional chapter. As a three to five chapter monograph this would have been ideal if unmarketable. Queenan is still humourous and readable - I frequently found myself laughing aloud in the most innapropriate locations as I read this. However his other books are better."
3,rock and roll,"not old time rock n roll more modern type, good music, good lyrics some thing which will grow on ya"
5,My favorite CD,this has to be one of my most favorited cds and I am so glad that I bought it. I listen to it all the time.
4,Great music find,Heard this on satellite radio while driving one day.. Checked out the album samples and ordered...Now one of my new fav's. to bad they only have this one album
5,Just Like Hearing An Audio Book.,"From start to finish this album is great.The production is great, but there could be a few more heavier songs.The lyrics truly do tell great stories.It's as if you're listening to an audio book.Buy this album, you will love it."
5,100$ ????,the cd is amasing and i love it but shour as hell didnt spend 100 $ for mine lolthey ar a great band but dont buy from this seller
3,Christopher Lee Saves Another Poor Movie,"I rented this movie because I have recently become a big fan of British horror film actor Christopher Lee. Lee is the saving grace of this film.The brutal and hypnotic monk Rasputin(Christopher Lee) is expelled from his monastery and temporarily gains great power by manipulating his way into the royal family of Russia.This movie is a disappointment. ""Rasputin and the Empress"" could have been a thrilling period piece about Grigori Rasputin and his impact on Russian history. Unfortunately, this film pays little attention to history and doesn't become much more than a mediocre Hammer horror film masquerading as a historical period piece. Christopher Lee saves this movie. ""Rasputin and the Empress"" offered Lee one of his better roles. He is forceful and frightening as this ruthless historical figure. Richard Pasco and particularly Barbara Shelley give fine supporting performances.Lee's peformance makes ""Rasputin and the Empress"" a must-see for all horror fans."
1,History Lesson for the easily pleased.,"If this film is to be trusted Grigory Rasputin was a rather charmless individual whose success with the opposite sex is put down entirely to hypnosis and a rather impressive beard. Lee displays none of the monk's wicked charisma or subtlety, and the result is a rather workmanlike narrative which portrays the central character as nothing more than a brutal charlatan. History, and the influence he achieved within the house of Romanov, seem to suggest there was more to Rasputin's character than this. A missed opportunity by Hammer."
3,Rasputin movie review...from a true follower,"This movie is very well put together, with many facts and so forth...yet the one negative is the assassination scene. It is NOTHING like the REAL assassination poor ole' Grigory Rasputin had to face...in this movie...he's just poisened and thrown out a window...THE END. In real life, much more had to take place to take down the ""Saint Who Sinned""."
1,Worst band ever,Busted are the worst band to ever come out of england being that they spend most of there time behaving like the bad boys of blink 182 Im not saying I dont like blink 182 but this band is just plain crap ....
5,good eye cream,great eye moisturizer for sensitive skin. fragrance free. best use in night time since it's a little oily under makeup.
4,192 Pages of Great Pictures and Interesting Text !,"A picture-filled delightful view of the molders of the century. Features some never before published photos, with fascinating stories about key moments in these people's lives. Includes people from Henry Aaron, to Nicolas Copernicus, to Ernest Hemingway, Ralph Nader, Benjamin Spock and Boris Yeltsin. You'll enjoy every page of this library volume."
3,people who shaped this century 21,"Would you please supply the list of 100 names of who these people are. Please, AMAZON, give me this essenial information about this book. I cannot decide whether to buy it unless you provide this minimal info needed in an adequate description of this book. Your CEO does not deserve TIME's man of the year award, when you neglect their book like this. Pleae fix ASAP. Thank you."
5,Just what I was looking for!,I got this for my son when he was a baby so all the diapers wouldn't be crinkled up. When I used it I didn't use the hard plastic outer shells for the wipes because it took up too much room so I just started using zip lock bags for the wipes so I could hold more diapers. I love it because I can fit 4-5 Size 2 diapers a good size of wipes and a big tube of desitin. Great purchase. Some other mommys say that when they get older you can use them for holding toys in the car or snacks when going on the run.
2,Very cheaply made.,"There is a problem with this item. The fingers are sewn together with just thread, meaning they rip easily with really not much use. Should be better quality in my opinion."
2,Not a good fit,This product is ok just to get an idea of what it's like to wear boxing gloves. Not very comfortable with the remotes inserted in the sleeves of the gloves. It's also a good idea to buy the wireless attachment for the remote because the wires get tangled. Not something I'd recommend.
1,useless,they are a prop. that's it. I thought there would be a sensor in the gloves the wii could detect. not true. just a pair of gloves
2,Boxing Gloves,The boxing gloves to big and was not able to send them back. Beause no retrun papers inside the box.
4,Just what I needed,"The biggest reason I like the book because it saved me so much money from buying the book at the college book store. Same book, same results with a lot less money by buying it online."
4,Empowering,"This book was full of great information and stories about how women have allowed society to dictate how they look and how they should feel about how they look. Though some of these stories about anorexics and bulimics felt a little out of place for me (someone who eats to cover up feelings), I gleaned something from every story told.This book is impowering in its message to get out there and seek your worth in more than your body image and to give yourself what you need to be successful."
4,Powerful and overwhelming but true,This book really grabbed me. It was almost too much for me by the time I got done reading it. It will really give you a lot to think about and I recommend it to anyone out there who hates their body and is constantly dieting. If every woman read this book maybe we'd all stop putting ourselves down all the time.
5,This is a great book for people who diets haven't worked for,"This is such an excellent book. My only fear is that many people do not realize that dieting can cause eating disorders and that's why I wish the book was also in the Health/Diet section of the stores. However it is NOT a diet book, but teaches us to eat naturally and normally and how to loose weight and keep it off by loving ourselves. However it is much more than that still. It helped me realize that my body is unique and may not conform to the cultural ideal. Thank God for this book."
2,Does not help at all,"I actually returned this book because it had very little , if anything, to do with WHY you actually compulsively eat. it did not go into or even explained the psychological factors that influence C.O. all this book talk about is how women's self-image is polluted with diet ads etc, etc. it does not deal at all with how to actually stop, in an effective way.same thing as Overcoming Overeating. the whole point of the book is to stop dieting and to stop having a dieting mentality. also it doe snot deal with the actual cause of you overeating ( which is not dieting)if you really want to overcome overeating and end your obsession with food, you need to know why you are physiologically addicted to food. why you find so much pleasure in it. and for that you have to read books with substantial research, not just a feminist sound-off.read : the pleasure trap, LIfe is hard- food is easy , to name a few good ones.but this one and her other one won't help you at all."
5,The Book is Good,"This book was a gift given to me by a friend years ago. I own and have read about twelve books on the topic. Out of all of them, this has been by far the best. It's the kind of book that takes you on a journey inside yourself. If you have any eating issues then this book is a worthwhile read."
5,Great book for a 3 yr.old,"my grandaughter loves it, the parents had to read it 12 times the first day"
5,The French Frank Herbert,"You know it's true. Your inner teenage brat is crying out for something in which the forces of light can clearly trump the forces of darkness, even if they have to be as evil as the the bad guys. Jodorowsky is your man. Because his artists have lots of time to do their art, the art is always stunning. One of the reviewers here complained of cliches in the story. And there are times when the resolution to problems seems too pat. But the plot twists are so durned hilarious that you can completely overlook it.My sole complaint with this series of books is directed at Humanoids Publishing. I would really prefer to see this whole series collected in a giant edition, like Marvel is doing with Grant Morrison's X-Men (usually also quite amusing) and Bendis's Spider-Man. That way we get the art at the size it was intended to be seen at AND we get the entire story arc."
3,it's typical,"This is typical jodorosky. I've read a number of his works and they're all the same: excellant imaging centered around violence, and a story line which only serves to support that violence. If you're into it, fine; but I've read this book and the next (""blood and steel"") and I don't see myself getting the third.And, I agree totally with the other reviewer. The two robots (one telling the story to the other) are tedious in the extreme.Buy it for the art; but don't expect much else."
5,Beautifully photographed study of deaf Nepalese subculture.,"""Buddhas in Disguise"" is a richly illustrated and knowledgeable portrayal of the life, environment and culture of the deaf in Nepal, written by a woman who spent three years living and working with these forgotten but brave people. The book is worth getting for the photography alone, which is wonderful, but the photos are accompanied by a fascinating description of a people about which the world is nearly completely ignorant. If you are interested in Nepal, in foreign cultures, in excellent photography, or deafness, I highly recommed this book"
3,The book is okay,Its not really like the movie its competly different and i wanted more picture in this book because i love picture books
2,"Meh, Nothing Special","I think the writing in this book is seriously outdated. I read these books when I was younger, but I found that I didn't really have any memory of whether or not I thought they were any good. I think the reason I had a lack of memory is because this book is simply not memorable. There are so moments that are fun but overall this book isn't anything special. I think Beverly Cleary has other books that a so much better."
3,"Not the best, but...","I love this book just because it is the beginning of the series, but Beezus comes across as a wimp. If your little sister is riding around the house making a racket, you don't just sigh and do whatever she wants to make her stop -- you yank that harmonica out of her mouth. Or, better, you threaten some horrible (G-rated) punishment to make her stop on her own. Remember, balance of power and all that. Beezus really acts like the typical 50s ""good girl"" here, while Ramona seems to be blazing a trail toward the 1960s and beyond. Thank heaven Beezus grows a spine and acts a little less perfect in later books."
3,A Little Girl With a Big Imagination,This was an O.K book. I thought it should have a little less problems and a little more time and adventure to solve them. Otherwise this was a good book.The main charecter Ramona drives her sister crazy with every thing she dose. Everybody says she's the little girl with a big imagination.I think the kind of reader who would like this book would have to like a lot of little problems and not one big one.
5,Great for Children... & wonderful for Adult Readers Too.,"I spent my summers reading Beverly Cleary stories, and loved every page. With the stories still vivid in my memory, I picked up this book for a second read as an adult. I was delighted to find that it was even more enjoyable today. Mrs. Cleary is able to create honest, real life characters that have made me laugh out loud. I have since read ""Ramona and her Mother"", ""Ramona and her Father"", and ""Ramona Forever"" (which had a very touching conclusion), and plan to read them again someday - to my child. You won't be disappointed."
4,Funny,"A sweet story about a sensible girl and her spirited younger sister. Ramona is one of the funniest characters I have ever read about. I have enjoyed watching her grow through the series of books that Beverly Cleary has devoted to her, but I have never tired of reading about what a brat she was when she was little. I first read about Ramona in the Henry Huggins books. Since then I have thought she was as interesting as she was exasperating. When I have children, especially daughters, I will make sure that ""Beezus and Ramona"" is one of the first books they read."
5,PIAA lights,These are the best all around lights for the money. I had them on a Ram truck for years & just put them on my Jeep Wrangler. Excellent product.
5,Great device!,"Looked for a cart that wasn't too big - needed something compact & lightweight so it could fit into my 07 Civic when the husband wasn't around to help move our daughter into her college dorm. We would have had a hard time without it - the teenage boys even thought it was a great idea, after they made fun of my purchase at first! We will probably use it at least 4 or 5 times a year for the next 4 college years that lie ahead!"
4,Over Alaska,"Great product for a relatively low price. Over Alaska shows footage of many of the state's attractions. Might not have the greatest narration or presentation, but it looks beautiful. Recommended for nature fans."
3,"Good demo for new HDTV, but not very entertaining","The imagery is stunning, and it's a great way to show of your brand new TV, but the storyline is completely absent, the editing is choppy, and there's just very little entertainment value. The entire disc is just a series of short snippets, strung together with no encompassing theme, storyline, or even any transitions.This is certainly not in the same league as Blue Planet or Planet Earth, but it's probably worth $10 (I paid $11 with free shipping) if you've just bought a new HDTV and want to see what it's capable of.But it's unlikely that you'll watch this disc more than 2-3 times."
5,The Best Quilting book for Beginners,"I love this book, it has all of the basics with pictures and quick techniques that making quilting easy for starters. I was taught using this book and was so happy to find it used on this site for a bargain. I now use it to get others started.Thank you thank you thank you."
4,One of my favorite books of all time!!,"This is astory about family, hardship, and the beauty/horror of China. It is moving, beautiful, and easy to read. Enjoy!!"
4,Pearl Buck trilogy in one volume,"I am very happy with the condition and price.Appreciate having two of the novels that I have not previously read.Her writings are worth the time, in fact I have to wonder why The Good Earth (or Dragon Seed; like this better) are not read in American high schools. Oh, yes, they aren't PC."
1,Each Volume Is Separate,"I purchased this thinking that it contained all three volumes in one book. However, you must purchase each volume separately if you want all three. The product arrived in adequate time but it was only the first volume. The Good Earth. So if you want ""Sons"" and/or ""House Divided"" you have to purchase each one separately."
4,Principals and Design of Mechanical Face Seals,"The book provides an excellent look at some of the more technical aspects of mechanical seal design. It is a very good reference for any rotating equipment engineer. While it has some very intricate details, it does provide a lot of real word applicable knowledge."
4,"Excellent read, useful material inside for all painters.","Greg makes some insightful observations and reveals how his attention to the subjects he paints are unified through careful alignment of space, colour intensity, tonality, and reflection. An understanding of paint strokes and how they transpose successful messages or nervous twitches is a skill we all need to master. I appreciate the work shown here and was inspired to pay more attention to my palette, specifically in organization and in being bolder where boldness is the solution and being subtly were subtly is required. His loose style is very ""paintery"" and is much appreciated by my self included. I tend to not be as loose nor want to hyper blend everything as Greg also rejects. I am still finding my spot and this book is helping me get closer to that. Great read, lot of insightful tips and solutions revealed."
4,An ok book,"There are some good tips in this book on layout, but nothing really that an artist can't figure out for herself. It's an ok read if you are new to painting but don't waste your time if you already have been painting a while."
5,helpful,"I really enjoy this book, it has so many helpful tips and teaches how to fix the things you have done wrong."
3,Artist problem solving,"Mixed feelings about this book. As an artist, I find the work of the artist too somber and some of the color choices stiffling. He is an accomplished and well known artist but I don't want to paint like him. The problem solving techniques he lists and explains are very valid, he has obviously done his training well."
4,Good resource,"This book seems like a really good resource for an intermediate painter looking to take his or her painting to the next level. My habit is to devour books and move onto the next one, but this is one that I may keep near the easel for future reference."
5,Excellent !!,"The book is carefully planned and the explanations are clear and to the point. It just deals with representational and classical art and compositions, but the topics dealt with can be applied to more contemporary subjects , even to abstract oil paintings or other media."
2,good for basics or beginners,ok for beginners and those who paint in an impressionistic style. could focus a bit more on materials. some good basic tips.
2,Not that great,I wanted a comprehensive book on oil colors this is more about the basics then anything else.
5,The Christian Castro cd to buy!!!,"I just recently got this cd and of all the Christian Castro cd's that I have, this is my favorite one. Some of my favorite songs are Volverme A Querer and Mi Vida Sin Tu Amor. This is a great addition for any Christian Castro collection. Highly recommended!"
3,not a toy,I bought these to hang out by our pool. They look great and seem to be sturdy. I have not had to use them for anything and hope not to. I have been looking for a couple of years and this is the first I have found that is affordable.
3,the journeyman,"I ordered this film, from the past reviews, and found this to be a unique western. The script was different. Without giving too much away, it is of two brothers.. one bad, the other good. I found this to be an exceptional western, as most westerns are. A small but good one. Cheers. Robert Warren. Melbourne, Australia."
1,Confusion on the Border,"The ""Journeyman"" is the most confusing Western I have ever seen, and I've seen hundreds and hundreds. Filmed along the border in the Big Bend Country of Texas the story is a complete mishmash to the point of sometimes being unable to determine which character is which. Don't be misled by Willie Nelson's name in the cast: he's killed off in the first minute. The writing, direction, and acting (except for Barry Corbin) are all abysmal. You will be disappointed in the film."
4,Kilgour's Most Accessible Recording,"Although I enjoyed the diversity and experimentalism of Kilgour's last release, Feather in the Engine, it wasn't solid like David Kilgour & the Heavy Eights, magical like Here Come the Cars or hummable like Sugar Mouth.But along comes Frozen Orange. This is the album that first-time listeners should start with. Frozen Orange has a cohesive, polished sound that leaves David's charm unfiltered. The album is an excellent listen from start to finish: ten of the eleven songs are winners, a ratio unattained in many of his previous recordings.Highly highly recommended. Frozen Orange offers a welcome marriage of the songcraft from Here Comes the Cars and the studio polish of later albums. If you familiar with DK or his work with The Clean, this recording should rejuvenate your enthusiasm for the artist."
3,Too Rushed and Overbearing,"Unlike the first volume in this series, the artist is alot less restrained - he wants to show off his flute abilities more than bringing out the qualities of Japanese music. You can hear him huff and puff as he's rushing through the pieces - I couldn't wait for some of the tracks to finish. The first volume with Laskine was much better."
5,DVD's available at Disney,"I searched for years and found these in 2007 at Disney DVD's! They are as wonderful as I remembered them. Check out the Disney DVD club, you need only order a couple for just shipping charge and then order these. I am glad I did. I wonder why it's taking SO long for amazon to get them. Great family movies available on DVD."
5,Looking for this moving for over ten years!!!,"I've never seen Polly Comin Home, but I loved Polly and watched it everytime it came on television when I was younger. I'm 24 now and have been looking for this movie on dvd/vhs for as long as I remember. I've been very surprised that it hadn't been released sooner. I think that it would be percieved well by all, young and old, and would love to add both to my collection."
5,I love these 2 movies!!!!,I remember getting excited about going to my grandmas house to watch these movies. Then I found she taped over the with Soap Operas. So if you could hurry and put them on dvd it would be greatly appreciated. : )
4,I made DVDs of this movie!,"Until Disney releases the dvd, I have the first film here:http://dvds.awardspace.com/polly1.htmland the sequel, Polly Comin' Home here:http://dvds.awardspace.com/polly2.html"
5,"""This is a story about a child""",Like many old Disney Channel movie's from the late 80's and early 90's. Polly is one that was never available on vhs or dvd.This is movie is based on the book Pollyanna which is also a movie starring Haley Mills (The Parent Trap movie's and That Darn Cat). This movie stars Cosby kid Keisha Knight Pulliam (Beauty Shop and The Cosby show) who is an orphan who moves in with her rich aunt Polly (Rashad) and change's the whole town and all the people in it. It was then followed by the t.v. sequel Polly Comin' Home which is also just as good. I highly reccommend this movie and is'nt common but someone might have a recorded copy for sale. Other great Disney Channel t.v. movie's:Parent Trap IIParent Trap IIIParent Trap Hawaiian HoneymoonFreaky Friday (1995)Polly Comin' HomeDisney put this and these movie's on dvd soon! I will be waiting
3,The description is not very good,This is about Childhood abuse and incest. I was looking for a book on how to help an adult survivor.
1,Not pleased,"I bought this tool with more expectations and was let down. The tool turned out to be a full 1 degree off. I guess this might be alright for rough framing, but this tool has no place in a metal or fine wood working shop. Stephen LancasterP.S. I emailed General Tool and told they about my issue and they replied that they would send me a ""inspected"" replacement."
4,Protractor,"I love this tool. This is the second one I have purchased. Wore the other one out. Love it.Sturdy, and will take a lot of abuse. Just don't leave it in the rain."
2,ehh..,"This a good product for quick refference.. Not for professional grade work. The one I ordered was intened to be spare for what i already had anyways. Its about 1.3 degrees off. I noticed a friend at work had one just like it and his was .9 degrees off. So im guessing if you oerder one of these, its a hit and miss on the accuracy. Good luck.."
4,Nice and clean,I like this stuff. It doesn't smell bad and it feels good after you shave. It leaves your face feeling clean.
4,Great tool for the hobbyist,"I needed a nail gun to secure a piece of narrow plywood to a finished wall cabinet, and this filled the bill nicely. I'm only getting started doing woodworking, so I didn't want or need to break the bank. I was glad to find this and happy with its performance. As others have said, you need to follow the directions and hold down the head when nailing to get the nails flush. I'll definitely be using it again."
5,Hidden Jewel,"Truly this is one of Matthau's greatest characters! Elaine May is at her best! I have long waited for this film to be released on DVD. I have never seen the movie outside of rare TV showings or my old and near worn out VHS. I eagerly await this new release. If you are a Matthau fan, this movie is a must. If you are not a fan, this film may well make you one. Perhaps someday a director's cut will be made available as the original intentions of Ms. May are much deeper than the theater release."
3,The Blu-ray version has been tampered with - it isn't the original movie soundtrack.,"This is one of my top 10 movies of all time, but it never had a DVD release. I was delighted when the movie came out on BR but was shocked and disappointed to find that the idiots who did this release had CHANGED THE SOUND TRACK. The original movie had a somewhat sad musical theme when the Walther Mathau character loses his money, it underwrote the scene's poignant themes as the character looks forward to his new life of destitude. Now, however, the soundtrack is a silly tune with comedy bird tweeting. The same idiot music was repeated at the end and it substantially changes the emotion of the character's transition.Ironically, Elaine May, who starred and directed the film had previously abandoned it in a huff because the final editing had been taken out of her hands by the producers, changing her version of the story. One wonders if this isn't a factor in this new and somewhat annoying release."
4,Uncanny,"I am a fan of Walter Matthau and this was cute, but not his best. It is definitely a self-esteem booster."
5,a new leaf,Is avaible on DVD- Scream of a movie from 1971-surpasses movies since then- Elaine May made this incrediblefilm that surpasses all since then! Total comedy!!!! Doesnt get better than this---
3,Worth it for just the lawyer scenes.,"Many wonderful vignettes. The opening will pull the heartstrings everyone who has owned a lemon of an automobile. Everyone who has bounced a check will love the trust manager who just can't make himself understood about what it means to live within one's means. And the plot resolution that finds the playboy who really is a good manager, and loves his wife.But it desperately needs and deserves the director's cut."
3,A New Leaf,"The video was in fine shape. I bought it as a gift, so was willing to pay the price; but I would never normally pay that much for a vhs--simply not worth it. Also, couldn't understand why it was not on dvd."
3,"At times funny, but nothing approaching classic","Excited to see this movie lauded with praise and presenting the Matthau-Mays pairing, I was dissapointed in the delivery. Although at times humorous and sophisticated, the movie labors frequently and convoluted wordplay is oftenmuch ado about nothing. There's no real chemistry between Walter and Elaine,and the characters aren't defined or beleivable. The whole farce about the staff on the take was very flat as well. Aside from several on cue moments from Walter, this movie is largely dissapointing, and lacks the zip of the similarlyveined ""How to murder your wife"" with Jack Lemmon."
1,Misses,"I'm a huge Walter Matthau fan, and I thought I had seen all his movies, but I had never even heard of this one. And I was disappointed. It does try to be funny, but it misses by a long shot. He and Elaine May play their parts well, but the story is so flat that I fell asleep and had to finish it later -- and the only reason I bothered to do that is because I kept thinking something would happen. Boring."
2,Olive DVDs not close captioned,"My husband and I loved this hilarious movie seen many years ago (when he could still hear) in a theater and we would love to have it on DVD. I'm disappointed that there aren't sub-titles or captioning, So I won't buy it for that reason."
4,Old school Walter Mathau - wonderful,"This was my maiden Amazon Instant movie and it worked great! Easy to set up, fast to get stream - no problems."
4,Great Walter Matthau Movie,This is a classic. Primarily it's about one man finding himself and secondly about two totally different people building a relationship. The opening scene really sets the stage.
5,"FUNNY, CLEVER AND HIGHLY ENTERTAINING",HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE ON THE BIG SCREEN.EXPECT IT TO BE MUCH OF THE SAME ANDAN ADJUNCT FOR CHRISTMAS GIFT GIVING.IRV LE VINE
4,A classic,"""A New Leaf"" is classic Elaine May writing. Hilarious performances by her and Walter Matthau! It is well worth buying."
5,"A classic. It's funny, dark, but also endearing.","Yes, all of the previous reviews you have read are true. This is a great, if underrated, movie. My intention in writing this review is to persuade the media moguls to release this production on DVD. (Please, we'll buy it if you make it!)"
5,Both tender and hilarious,"This movie is like a fairy tale turned social satire. A lazy spoilt dandy found himself pennyless due to his prodigality and lack of the most elementary financial skills. His Jeeves-like butler suggests marriage whit a rich woman... and from there we go in a delightfully funny story,brilliantly acted and written, whit many unguessable turns.The scene of the marriage proposal whit a goofy but gentle heiress is histerically funny. A tale of moral maturation unusually amusing, a social satire unusually poignant and a very peculiar love story. For like in all fairy tales, love triumphs in the end."
4,An American CLASSIC,"By today's standards, the acting in older movies is often dull and the plots are boring. But 'A New Leaf' starring Walter Matthau and Elaine May is a great movie that deserves more attention from the public. With dark humour like that of Fargo and Ravenous, and great acting with a good plot, A New Leaf is sure to please. The story, revolving around a penniless playboy trying to kill his inept, incompetant and ""feral"" new wife, a very well-off heiress, was certainly unorthodox in its day. Based on a short novel, this movie excells and goes beyond the barrier of common Classic and Contemporary American Cinema."
4,Elaine May is Adorable,"This movie is subtly hysterical (which sounds like a contradiction in terms, but it's not.) Walter Matthau is hilariously cast against type as a foppish playboy. And Elaine May is wonderful as the nerdish but good woman he attempts to prey upon. Anyone is loves comedy can't miss this. I wish May had written and directed more movies (and I don't mean ""Ishtar."")"
5,Charming and Hilarious! A Classic!,"We LOVE this movie! We watch it periodically and finally bought it. Written and directed by, and starring Elaine May (remember Mike Nichols?) with Walter Mathau. The acting and dialogue are priceless. A little gem. Enjoy!"
4,"This product is great for deep sleep as well, and vivid dreaming.","I've only recently started taking this..and I've taken it before bedtime. I get a good nights sleep with vivid dreaming, and silica is important for brain function."
5,GREAT—Also Helps Get Rid of Cysts!,"I'm caffeine sensitive and read on a blog somewhere that a silica complex can help get rid of bartholin cysts. I had already undergone minor surgery to have it drained, and nothing was helping—until this! Seriously, within days of taking this twice a day, it was completely gone. It was a miracle! You have nothing to loose, give it a try!"
3,No difference,I bought this product for my hair and I have not seen any difference good or bad so it's up to you.
1,Nothing but gossip,"The book is difficult to digest even if you are interested in the crisis unfolding in the Catholic Church. The book is primarily cheap gossip exploiting the immature gay sexuality of the Vatican. The writer gloats excitedly over petty indiscretions and drops names of clergy no one knows except those who live inside the walls of the Vatican. What is appalling is the fact that the authors are in denial about what is really going on and misses the important elements of the situation like the cause, the harm done to the faithful and a remedy. Unless you are interested in Paris Hilton in a roman collar don't bother."
3,"A fine primer, but flawed","If you're looking for a step-by-step-hold-your-hand-guide to ArcView then this is your book. However ...and this is a big However... you'd better learn each lesson thoroughly as you go along, because there is no index. Let me repeat... no index. Oh, sure there's pages and pages of ESRI software license agreement, but no index. That being said, it is a fine reference and a good place to learn the basics."
5,"Students learn how to use ArcView 9 to create maps, collect, collate and analyze data, and more","For a workbook for ArcView 9, Wilpen Gorr and Kristen Kurland's GIS Tutorial is the perfect item of choice. It pairs a 180-day trial version of ArcView 9 on CD-ROM and data with exercises which require learners to perfom basic GIS tasks without step-by-step instruction - requiring both thought and a real ability to understand ArcView rather than routine memorization. Students learn how to use ArcView 9 to create maps, collect, collate and analyze data, and more. Many a teacher will make this a course text."
5,Good preliminary to Mastering ArcGIS,"We used Mastering ArcGIS in a GIS practicum course-dual level, and did 2 chapters a week including all exercises. I had had several GIS theory courses with a bit of GIS practice,and found it frustrating, although I got through it. I then decided to use the GIS Tutorial book to pick up some stuff I might not know, and to prevent me from forgetting it all over the summer. It would have been much better to use this book first--I have learned a lot I didn't know--then progress to the Mastering ArcGIS book. I admit I'm older than the average college student-we didn't even have calculators when I was a student the first time, so I didn't grow up with computers, but had one once they came out. If any professors are reading, use this book first for your GIS lab."
5,Fantastic GIS Tutorial!!!,"I originally purchased this book for a college class that I am taking. It is easy to follow and self-explanatory. It is so easy to use that you almost don't need a professor to teach you. This book is wonderful. Almost anyone could pick it up, install the software that comes with it and be using GIS in moments- with ease. This book will wt your appetite for what GIS is capable of doing. There seem to be no limits, just one's imagination."
1,Caveat Emptor,"This is a text designed at the third grade level for Bryman/ITT Tech and the like. The Workbook is a picture book of examples, little of which relate to the assignments at the end of every chapter. Note there is neither index nor glossary. The CD's that come with it require validation and are timed to expire after 180 days. ESRI is proud of this book, but without justification. It lacks any sort of professional documentation for the ArcGIS and ArcMap programs and questions to workbench-support@esri.com are ansered by ""see the book."" They vary the theme a bit, but this is always the reply. But ""the book"" doesn't have the necessary data to acomplish the assignment.Unnecessary frustration with this deal.Best to be avoided.[...]"
1,This thing sucks!,"The headphones don't stay on, and it runs out fast, and the volum doesn't work that well! And the buttons on the cd player, it doesn't work!"
2,not good very bad,i got this one for my self cuase it was so pretty got it does not work headphones are horrid buy the pink bubble one from gpx instead it works headphones are better it is just plin better quality
3,Headphones,We also had problems with the headphones when we purchased the bratz CD player - had to replace them 2 weeks after purchase. Otherwise my daughter has enjoyed it.
4,what do you want out of a video?,"i have thought about this many times, and i still don't know how anyone can expect to learn any type of martial art from a video. this video is very helpful for those who has started learning aikido, and just need a little extra help from a different angle. if you are learning aikido, i think this video is worth a look. if you haven't done aikido before, this video can give you a taste of what it is about, but don't expect to be an expert from just watching a video (of any kind!)"
1,Yet another DVD doesn't work,I ordered my first copy and found that the DVD did not work. I contacted Amazon and they were great taking care of the return. I requested a replacement copy and it arrived with more scratches then I've seen on most rental DVD's. Surprise surprise the second copy did not work either. It appears quality control has not been high on the producers list. Do you think the third time could be a charm?
4,Adequate video,"I wished I had a good video of Aikido when I was first studying it. I cannot compare this video to others as this is the only one I have seen. It does show the various techniques. I would have liked more content and explanation, but I'm pleased with the video. I feel good about this purchase."
1,"Bad disk, Poor information","First, this disk would not play on my DVD player. It would only work on my computer.Second, this disc briefly mentions that it illustrates the Tomiki branch of Aikido, which uses very different terminology and basic techniques than the more prevalent styles of Aikido.Third, there is very little information of how most of the demonstrated techniques actually work. (Note carefully: these techniques are DEMONSTRATED, not taught.) The concept of ""breaking balance,"" is briefly mentioned at the end of the DVD, but is never related back to the basic techniques demonstrated.Last; the websites mentioned on the disc no longer seem to have any information about Aikido.If you want to learn something about Aikido, go to a local Dojo, watch a training session, and talk to the sensei. Then use the money you'd pay for this DVD for an introductory lesson."
2,Not great for goats,"This ointment is painful and was ineffective on my mixed breed milk goat Doeling. I will reove horns with a Calicrate band when the kids grow up, if it is needed. Perhaps a good debudding tool would be wise too? Much luck!"
5,dehorning powder,Item arrived in appropriate amount of time. I have not used the product as yet will post success when I do.
2,This is not a story...,"as the previous reviewer states, but rather an essay. I mention that just to let you the would be buyer know, that you are getting a 21 page essay in a pamphlet format. It would have made a great book, and a great story. That is what I thougt I was buying. As for the essay itself; having read the sample pages, I was hoping for insights into how he used the philosphies of Epictetus to handle the events of his imprisonment. He does this only in a general sense."
3,"Great story, comic book characters","The scientific concepts behind this were very interesting. I loved the probe, the nanomachines, and speculation about the nature of life on Titan.The stories of human relationships on the habitat, however, were really cheesy, and the characters were exaggerated in a way that made me think of old, low budget westerns or comic books.Despite this, there is one delightful surprise toward the end that made the reading experience worth it."
2,"A bit of a rip-off of ""2001""??","I enjoyed reading this novel -- good, light, summer kind of reading with a sci fi bent that is satisfying.But weren't some of the plot lines just a bit too reminiscent of ""2001: A Space Odyssey""? To wit:(1) A computer malfunctions because of conflicting programming, which is mysterious and deeply frustrating to its creators and eventually leads the machine to attempt to kill humans (in 2001, HAL succeeded, whereas Titan Alpha does not).(2) A mysterious race of extraterrestials has placed artifacts in the solar system that may be sending off a massive ""we've been found, there's intelligent life here"" signals (the obelisk and Jupiter in 2001; the nanomachines and Saturn's rings and the electromagnetic every-16-days pulse in the Bova series).Because these are such core elements of the plotline, the result is that there's just a bit too much of a ""been there, read that"" feeling with ""Titan."" A fun read, but not much more."
2,I really wanted to like it,"I was a bit disappointed to find the characters so stilted, in a made-up world with such interesting premises. A ten-thousand person habitat orbiting Titan? Great!Wait a minute, they aren't excited to be in space???OK, then, let's see if the scientists are any better. Oh, the head guy is unable to make his project go and is a dick to everyone around him? I loved House, MD--this should be fun! No wait, he's dull. Not sure how he ever got this far.Ah, a stunt man! Excellent! He should be good for some mileage...oh no, he's not interested in adventure any more.Aha! A nanotechnologist exiled from Earth for this prohibited technology! What do you mean, she isn't doing anything?I quit about halfway through.I used to love this stuff when I was a kid, but life is too short for mediocre books, especially about big science."
4,Please check this out!,"I know all you Genesis fans ,like myself really look for rare stuffor new stuff ,from the past Genesis bands. Well ,this issomething very special,by Tony Banks. Its all together different,I was expecting those ""genesis"" chording. But it is wonderful to listen to. If you go on Tony Bank's site,it tells of the hardshipof ""converting"" his ideas to the London Philharmonic. A greatCD to get,just listen to the different sounds of Banks."
1,Amorphous noodling from a pretentious prog rocker,"I loved Genesis back in the day. I heard one of the pieces from this cd tonight on the local classical station. Earthlight. At first I thought, this is okay, kind of lightweight, but okay. Then it began to shift in tone, melody: Vaughn Williams one minute, Claude Debussy the next ... no development, no reason for things to change ... kind of the worst aspect of new age music repeated over and over. I have no idea what Tony Banks involvement with the cd is ... but this music is just a bunch of pretty wanking ..."
5,Great Service. Quality product!,I placed this order on a Thursday and was suprised when I received an e-mail telling me that it shipped that same day. The product arrived well before the original estimated delivery date and was exactly as described when I purchased it. I will be shopping here again!
4,"Almost impossible to put on, but great once on","This grill cover was almost impossible to put on. I had to take my OEM plastic grill off and have my neighbor help me install this one over it because of the compound curve of the OEM grill. It has been on for several years without a problem and still looks great. Has been super once on. I was concerned that the 3M tape would not hold up to the temperature and weather extremes in Chicago, but not a problem."
4,faulty CD,"This is a great CD with some lovely music however, in answer to the previous review... I certainly HAVE noticed the annoyingly poor mastering of this CD - is there any way to get a decent version?"
2,"good for Mailer fans & literary types, misses mark for techs","I read this book 29 years after the event. I had high expectations because I had never read Mailer before and I've always been interested in science history and space and have read a number of books about and by astronauts. It was like Mailer wasn't there, he missed most of the important stuff because he felt beneath himself acting as a ""journalist"" instead of a ""writer"". Significant events & issues like running out of fuel at the last minute, or the computer geek who saved the mission at the last minute, the story behind the famous quote ""one small step for [a] man..."" were completely missed because he spent all the time telling us why he didn't want to write the story."
4,Reprint overdue,"I read this book more than 25 years ago, and recall the description of the launch as utterly thrilling.One particularly powerful image has stayed with me all that time. Apparently, tapered stainless steel hold-down bolts steadied the rocket on the launch pad. At liftoff they released the whole heaving thundering vehicle, simply by the Saturn's enormous thrust extruding them through holes in anchor plates! It is Mailer's excitement, awe and his inquisitive eye for telling detail that I recall, not his ego.I would love to re-read it."
4,Thermos,Perfect size for lunch boxes (not a child's lunch box). Keeps hot things hot and cold things cold! Fully functional and good quality.I like that it is stainless steel. It does not have a handle(and there is not one pictured so that is ok.) I just always think of a thermos having a handle.
3,Quality venues pity the prices have changed!,This book from an experienced and well travelled writer holds much historical interest and the places he writes about sound wonderful. The book is a bit outdated and probably some of the accomodation has long since gone but the places still remain. Another problem is the prices quoted are certainly historic but you can dream how wonderful it would be if that's all five star accomodation cost! Worth a read just for the writing.
3,O.K. but too short.,The story was compelling enough but it ends to abruptly. There are 58 pages of build up and 2 pages of resolution.
1,"Sorry, Warren. I Love You, Man... but Sorry.","Warren Ellis is the man. I loved his work on Marvel's Excalibur in the 90's, what I've read of his prose work seems solid and I keep up with his blog, mailing list and Freakangels webcomic without fail. But I can't think of any great writer that doesn't have at least one stinker, and this one is Warren's. There's just no freakin' point to it. Three issues worth of Britain beginning a space program after WWII and terraforming Mars in 2001. There's no major conflict, the characters aren't changed by the end of the story and nothing of great import occurs. Well, no one's perfect, right?"
4,Wonderfully charming movie,Lots of fun for all ages. Micky Dolenz and Mary Woronov played the villians exquistly. Well worth the time and money enjoyable from the begining.
1,"Tedious, unfunny ""comedy"" guaranteed to try your patience.","Only the laughs are invisible in this tedious, unfunny comedy. Director Fred OlenRay sets a new low, and for the director of ""Bad Girls from Mars,"" that's saying something! It's very sad to see Dee Wallace Stone, best known from ""E.T.,"" reduced to a film of such nonexistent ambitions."
4,Good Quality,Good quality easy to read numbers and fine resolution. Be aware that this only measures outside angles and not inside angles which was what I needed it for.
3,What I expected.,"Not a high dollar item, but exactly what I wanted. Heavier duty than some I've used. Serves its purpose well."
1,terrible,"This ""textbook"" has very few and skimpy examples ofhow to work problems.It also has a solution book which is not available tostudents!!!Therefore, the student cannot check his/her answers tothe review exercises at the end of the chapters!! Huh???I can't believe that any school or instructor would choose thisthis as a textbook or even as an additional reference!!!"
3,There are actually usable textbooks out there!,"It certainly shocked me, after the rash of worthless textbooks I've had to buy in my college career, but this book was actually usable. It's not spectacular, mind you, but I don't think there is such a thing as a spectacular textbook. It was good enough to keep after the class was over, and I may even refer to it again sometime."
4,A good book,This book is pretty good and you can learn digital design by yourself even not go to the class since the book is enough.
3,If your like me youll struggle,"I have taken one computer programming course prior to using this book, It was rough to say the least. The biggest problem with the book is not the content but rather the way at which its presented. It will tell you to refer to diagrams on different pages quite frequently when trying to understand what there trying to get across and most times you'll forget what the point of looking on the other pages were. I ended up using a different book to understand the content and it helped way more than this one because the manner in which it was written was a lot more logical. There is a lot of fluff and wasted reading in this book and it doesn't get to the point of what you need to know or how to learn it."
4,Good shirt - fits small,"Good material for active lifestyle where you still want to look good. A gift - much appreciated, but I did have to return the L and get the XL for a 6', 190 lb man...or maybe he lied about the weight..."
3,"More, More, More!","I wish M.E. Kerr hadn't taken her own advice (""Cut! Cut! Cut!"") and given us more breadth--I loved what was there, but I found myself closing the book and wishing there were many more chapters. What about ""If I Love You, Am I Trapped Forever?"" and ""I'll Love You When You're More Like Me,"" not to mention her silence on her recent forays into gay issues--what made her start focusing almost exclusively in that area? I also wanted more biographical info that we didn't get in ""ME ME ME,"" such as what things were like once she started selling her young adult books and became so respected by students, teachers, and librarians. I've been a fan since high school (over 10 years), have read all her books, and I hope she does a Volume II, because I'm dying for more!"
3,I got two 'J's and no 'T',They work - but the second J is a little confusing. They're not so flimsy that you can't flip a whole drawer full of DVDs with them.
5,They do the job.,"I'm organizing my DVDs and needed dividers to use with a snap-lock cardboard box. These are perfect. Unlike others here, none of the cards were stuck to each other. The card stock is substantial, but it is still index card stock: it will not last forever. For the purpose, they are perfect in design and price.Jerry"
2,Glossy Paper,"These will not hold up with moderate use. They are made of paper, and when thumbing through cds, I imagine they wont last long."
1,Useless,Like others I received a stack of file guides that were all stuck together and could not be separated without damage. There were useless.
3,Too tall for snap boxes,"These tabs are terrific, but they are too tall for the snap together boxes they are recommended with. The lid no longer sits down on the box, but instead just wobbles on top of the tab dividers. Looks fine, but when you grab the box, you can tell it isn't on there tight."
3,good but could be better,"I know these are $5 but hey...Ok, I have my cd's in cd sleeves. The caselogic clear sleeves with the disc in one side and the artwork in the other side. I stack these sleeves facing up (where you could drop the cd down into the sleeve. Stupidly enough, the dividers are not tall enough. The sleeves cut into about half of the letter! I turned the sleeves on their sides so that the dividers are much higher than the sleeves so now they stand out. The letters could also be bigger. And, yes they are made of glossy cardboard. Under frequent use, they could get a little frayed and bent, creased, ripped.However, there are not many options around for these. For the $ they are the best around. They also include dividers that say ""Music, Video, Games, etc"". I would buy them again knowing that i need to be delicate when sorting."
1,Too short - don't buy,"The rectangular portion is a full 1/8 inch shorter than a standard jewel case. Therefore the tabs do not stick out high enough and you can only see half the letter. Makes for a poor organizational tool. The construction and materials are OK for the $10 price, but the product is the wrong size."
3,Descent at Best!,"Mine did not stick together, as others have mentioned, but they were not tall enough for the tab to stick over the hanging disc sleeves in my 900 count case that Amazon suggested these for. They do not have the same metal hooks to hang on the rails of the case, so I was forced to tape them to the sleeves, which actually came out pretty decent. Construction was not expected to be great at $5, but they are not horrible either, being cardboard with a smoothe paint finish. I made the best of them and am content.*** The title is absolutely wrong. It states that there are only files for A-Z, and even, specifically, says ""26"" count. There are also tabs for: music, files, videos, data, Back-up, games, pictures, and one other that I cannot remember off the top of my head. I did not care about any of these, although they may end up coming in handy in the future. I do wish they would have included tabs for 0-9 instead though."
3,ok,"I bought these along with some storage boxes that were said to ""often buy together"". The top of the box would not fit on after I added this product. The product itself was ok , I would have liked a wider tab ."
4,Exactly as described. Helped organize hundreds of dvds,"These guides did exactly as expected, it helped us to organize our personal and retail dvds along with the snap and store cd storage box and cd sleeves. Received a few duplicate letters, but hardly a big deal. Very happy with purchase."
4,Worked For Me,"The product came timely, which is what I wanted. They are like a glosy hard paper divider, and worked great for what I needed them for."
5,Index cards,"These cards are fine....just wish the letters were bigger...rather hard to see such small characters but they are of good value since they are so difficult to find. Perhaps you would consider making the letters larger..they would then be PERFECT.ThanksM - Mississauga, ON, Canada"
4,"Good price, okay quality.","I assumed these were plastic and was slightly disappointed to find that they're thick glossy paper. MIne were slightly bent at the corners when they arrived, but all in all, I can't complain. For the price, I got what I wanted."
4,Good index cards,My CD music collection takes up too much space. So I throw away the plastic cases and store the collection in small very useful boxes. These index cards make the collection manageable. Good product. Usa supplier
1,Not Compatible With Vaultz box.,"I have to say, you would think that this would be a great product! But it is NOT!The problem isn't necessarily with how it is made, as they are sturdy, but with how they are used.You would think, that the product being sold from the same company, and often advertised together, would work well together - WRONG!The tabs for these dividers stick up (so yes, you can access them) but also over the top of the box, so that you cannot close the lid. Instead, the lid kinda sits on the top of the tabs, instead of the top of the box.I ended up cutting the bottoms off of these to make them work the way that I wanted to.If you are looking for a divider to use in the Vaultz box, choose something else; or, just make your own out of heavy cardboard."
3,CD organizer,"I really wish I had gone with the set with the bigger letters. May just order that anyway. I also don't like, the fact, that the letter is only on 1 side"
3,TOO SHORT,"I wanted to use these on my CD bookshelf but they are too short...the tabs do not stick out far enough to see the letter. I am very disappointed, but I can rig something to make it kinda work. I should have just made custom ones from scratch."
4,Does what it's supposed to do,"Tabs to go with the organizer box. What can I say - they work. Only gave it 4 stars because the letters don't really extend high enough above the CD jewel cases to be easily seen. It works, but it would be nicer if they were about 1/8"" higher so they could be more easily seen. Other than that, no complaints."
2,missing tabs,The producd did not have the B or T tab in the manufacturers package. makes it difficult to file anything starting with a B or T
2,Controversial Book,"Debt Control is an interesting book with many controversial ideas. The author seems to think that the people can get away from paying their debt using the ""Statutes of Limitations"" Rule, for their state. After reading his book, I looked up the Fair Credit Act and found that he left out some clauses to certain laws on credit and the rights of the creditors and customers. It was fair price for the content of the book. I have read some other credit books by Steinberg and Russell, two of my favorite authors. Some of the terms are confusing because there is no definitions or terms to define them.I would recommend this book if you have nothing better to do. I did find the listing of creditors to request credit reports from helpful and the list of the state's representatives helpful."
5,Excellent Guide to help control your finances!,"I found the book very interesting and informative. The information provided would cost $1000's of dollars in fee's from legal representation. In fact, I'm not sure that an attorney would beable to provide as practical and as usefull of information as in the Debt Control book.Inconclusion, after purchasing and reading several books on this subject, Debt Control is by far the best source for information on the subject of managing ones money and controlling debt on the market today."
1,Out of Tune,"I know it's a toy, but this xylophone is offensively out of tune. I wouldn't subject anyone to it. It's terrible."
5,TOTALLY SURPASSED MY EXPECTATIONS!,"It was not easy to find a xylophone that met my criteria for my toddler daughter- I looked alot of places...then on amazon, I found a great price on this one, and it was a) wooden; b) colourful; and c) two octave. I expected a smaller, slightly clunky xylophone that would be just fine for my daughter's hyper musical outbursts, and if she liked it, we may upgrade in the future. NO NEED! This is a BIG, beautiful xylophone that is tuned well enough ( not 100% perfect pitch for those with a very sensitive ear, but pleasantly done and well made for an 'around 30$' childs/for fun instrument) and best of all, SHE LOVES IT! If there is a musically inclined toddler or younger child in your life, I would very highly recommend this xylophone!!"
1,Not at all what I expected,"Where is the glitzy glam of being a mistress? Where's the fun, and the sex, and the -- yes, I'll say it -- the gritty side of being the other woman? If that's what you're looking for, don't bother with this book because you'll find none of it. Instead, you'll find more information than you could ever want about a struggling actress and her friends. Add to the fact that there are long narrative passages in this book that seem to go on forever and you have a snoozer."
1,Panglosian paradigm of immanent transcendence,"I bought this book with high hopes of gaining deeper insight into ethics and military leadership. I only made it through the first chapter. Toner, using multiple Augustinian metaphoric similes to illuminate the transcendence of ethical conundrums delimiting the interrelationship of ipso facto avatars as Josiah Barnes in an obscure nineteenth century manuscript says, ""The power of the king is irrelevant to the Hobbesian construct of manifest legalism"", manages to bury the reader in so much jargon that it renders his arguments nearly impenetrable. I can't decide whether Toner wanted to obscure the fact that he has nothing to say, or whether he just wanted to sound important. Either way, this book is nearly unreadable. If you enjoy reading irrelevant quote after irrelevant quote buried in pseudo-intellectual babble, this book is for you."
1,Waste of money,"This book describes only puppies who are ""fearful"" - afraid of a leash, afraid of your absence, etc. etc. Most of the pit bull puppies I know are rambunctious and self-assured. There are no helpful tips for training those puppies.Also, the author says that if you have a full time job, you shouldn't adopt a pit bull. Most of the dogs in local shelters are put to death, and pit bulls, as well as pit bull mixed, are quite common in this state. If you have a fenced yard and will spend time, effort, and money to lovingly raise a dog, then I say go ahead & adopt one. They have barrels of energy, but are very loving animals and deserve a chance."
3,Maybe next time.,You know those albums that just barely fall short of being really good?This is one of'em.It's a solid release with songs good enough to make you want to listen to them repeatedly.But ultimately it gets lost in the competition.Which sucks - because Ashley surely has the goods needed to deliver an excellent album.Only time will tell if she ever will.
1,Wow. No.,"This looks nothing like the picture. I had read the reviews; it looked like only some of the reviews had problems with the toy, but most didn't, so I took a risk thinking whatever problem it had had been fixed by now.No. No, no, no. Although this isn't a Cactuar with ""some sort of problem,"" it is the Cactuar from Final Fantasy XI, not the traditional Cactuar that everyone is used to. It's also not posable. I just opened the package tonight; I'm definitely calling the company tomorrow and getting my money back."
5,"Cactuar as pictured, quality materials....","I was a bit hesitant to order my cactuar plush here, since so many people were having problems with getting the FFXI version. I went ahead and ordered while keeping my fingers crossed and lo and behold, I got the standard cactuar (as pictured). Couldn't be happier! It's made from quality material, though it is made in China, so we'll see how it holds up. The workmanship does seem pretty decent.You probably won't find it (by 'it' I mean an authentic, Square Enix-licensed one) much cheaper than the standard retail price, which I feel is overpriced, but since I feel that I got far more than my money's worth with the games I didn't feel too bad springing for it. I've wanted one of these for a long time!"
5,Review,This was purchased for my husband and my son because they are big Final Fantasy fans. They both love the toy and treat it as a precious item lol. Great to add for a collectors item.
4,"10,000 Needles!","Who doesn't want a stuffed Cactuar? This Cactaur is very well made and looks just like the picture. It is a little hard to pose, because the wire is so well protected, but a little effort got results. It can't really stand on its own, but if you put it by a wall it's fine."
5,A must have for Final Fantasy fans!,"I honestly expected Cactuar to bigger than it real size, But it's lovely & enjoyable!& something I wanted Since 1999, It's worth it!love my Cactuar :)"
4,Interesting and even-handed,"The topic of this book is basically ""I'm so cool"" by Paula Scher--which is fine, because Paula Scher really is one of the coolest people in design. I especially liked the first few chapters of the book, which talk about her early experiences working at CBS Records during the 1970s."
4,Scher Brilliance!,"I have to say I'm not a big ""fan"" of Paula Scher's visual style, it's far too ""horsey"" and ""big-boned"" for my taste, but I am a fan of what she has to say about the design profession and her experience in it.This book is an excellent reference/story book on the frustrations of dealing with clients (which are many, as I can relate) who have poor taste or are just clueless. I agree with everything Paula says here and enjoyed the grain of salt with all that's said. I can feel the frustration and exasperation Paula speaks of as anyone worth their blood has designed something great, only to have a client with tunnel vision ruin it. Sigh.Any serious designer should read this book, or already has. I would have no problem calling anyone who hasn't read it a poseur in this profession!"
4,NOT THE ONE!!!,"No not this time,I can`t hear any progression sinceConflict and Dreams. MAGNA CARTA has much better artisttry UNDER THE SUN OR LEONNARDO the absolute man. Sure Cairo have that YES like spiritual edge, but thats what gave prog its BAD name in the first place.I am pleased to own this CD as Itin some ways is not bad, good musicianship."
2,Not impressed,I did not find the book helpful or useful. You might as well have a 10th English grammar book.
3,What a mess!,"My 3-year old actually loves moon sand. And the monster truck concept is perfect fot this product. Since the molds crumble fairly easily, he has a ball creating the molds and destroying them with the truck.That said, cleaning moon sand up is a headache. There's a mat that comes with this kit, but it's a completely worthless square of cardboard. I immediately realized the mess that would ensue and put all the moon sand in a cookie sheet. The mess was somehat contained, but not enough considering the enthusiasm of a three-year old.Incidentally, there are two packs of moon sand. One pack is barely enough to fill one mold, so if you get this product, it might be a good idea to invest in an extra bag of sand."
5,The animorphs have over quadrupled in size!,"This book was fantastic! Lately, the books have been going a bit downhill, but the recent ones are brilliant. This book is amazing. Jake is depressed and cannot cope with leadership anymore, and thier parents are no help at all. They need to increase thier numbers, but they remember what happened with David. They have several options, a hospital where they could let disabled children become free, or a blind childrens school, the army, or the general public. The book keeps you in suspense all the time, and its also very emotional."
5,What do you do when you know the end is near?,"The Ultimate is the best Animorphs book yet. When the Animorphs realize the war is not going there way they must make a decision that could mean the fate of Earth. On a scale of 1 to 10, this is an 11.With great plot twists and never-ending action, The Ultimate stears you on a ride that you will not expect."
4,Decent addition to the series,"My son recently wrote the following mini-review:With 23 recruits from rehabilitation centers and schools for the blind (who, our heroes reason, would be less likely to be infested by the Yeerks), the Animorphs are prepared to tackle one of their biggest battles yet. The Yeerks gain the power to morph when Cassie chooses to protect Jake rather than stop the Yeerks from escaping with the ""morphing cube."" The enemy is now much more difficult to defeat. When increasing their numbers, the Animorphs remember what happened with David, a recruit from earlier in the series, who ""went bad"" and turned against the Animorphs after he received their powers."
2,Very Slightly Thrilling,"What was Applegate doing??? The new Animorph thing??? Hated it!!The one thing I liked was that they gave disabled kids a chance to fight. But still, the thing at the end... What was Cassie thinking??? I think she just lost the war for the Animorphs- or at least sentenced one to death . ."
5,Great Product,Great Product. Does exactly as it is advertized. No problems. Cuts through all I need it to clean & fast. I'd recommend it to everyone.
5,Another enjoyable series,We love Radio Theater by Focus on the Family at our house. These stories make our holidays enjoyable while travelling especially. Keep them coming!
1,How small a thought it takes to fill a whole life (Wittgenstein),"There is a single idea that permeates Koons work. This idea is neither good, nor original, nor indeed - since it has been 70 years since Duchamps ""Fountain"" - particularly exciting. If there were a ""Ladybird book of Modern Art"", Jeff's saccharine, 'easyfun' work would be that book. Koons art-as-commodity schitck would be more convincing if the buying public had to decide. His commodities fail as commodities - their status as art, is, of course guaranteed, since (see Duchamp) he has told us it is so. Show me one more Scots Terrier made of flowers and I shall reach for my Uzi in a frenzy of post-modern criticism"
1,try to make something good for once.,most of koons work is just duchamps idea repeated in several different forms.
3,A cool card for a cool price !!!,"Yes, this is a good little dvd for a cool price, although I'm ever luckier since I found it in a shop for the half of the price for which it's being sold here (I live in Belgium).The card will please the nostalgics, even matches like Sgt. Slaughter Vs. King Kong Bundy are suprisingly good. Only the Dusty Rhodes Vs. Kamala match is terrible....Dusty looks like being drunk/wasted and Kamala....well, is Kamala (good gimmick but no skills)...Anyway, I'm always happy to find such little treasures for such a cool price !!!"
5,Superb tongue in cheek look at society,GREAT video. Too smart and sophisticated for the average TV enthusiast. Michael Moore is one of those guys whom you would love to have a beer with and just talk.
3,What episodes are on the double feature?,I'm looking for NBC episode #3 with the bit about North Dakota. Is this on the double feature?
1,TV nation is a Red Nation,"Mr Moore. yes he is controversial, yes he is ground breaking, and yes he is a communist. Unlike other partisan Democrats who aren't afraid to admit their party lines, he is too whimp to admit that he is actually a bleeding heart liberal. He calls himself a Green Party member while does a fine job of advancing Liberal Party. These Clinton supporters will go to any length to support their corrupt priesident to any length. Just goes to show you how decent and moral Democrats have become. Mr moore, just come out of that dark Red closet out of yours and say what you really are -- a Red Commie."
2,Limited Functionality; Poor Documentation; Sloooow,"I have the unit installed on my home network, and it does work, albeit very slowly. I had purchased it in order to use it in conjunction with a four-drive USB 2.0 enclosure, but after some discussions with TrendNet, they admitted that the TS-200 would only ever see one of the hard drives in that enclosure. So, I had to buy a single 500gb external drive and now use that, but even in that configuration it's painfully slow and still doesn't work with some backup programs. And the documentation is not very complete, etc., but that's almost to be expected..."
2,"Not compatable, poor return service","This did not work with my external usb drive.Beware buying this product from antonline, as they have a poor return policy:Unfortunately, products with customer caused item, packaging or accessory damage; OR that are missing items, accessories or packaging; OR with activated software or intellectual property agreements; OR with missing packaging or accessories; OR that cannot be resold as new - exactly as you received the product are not eligible for return or refund."
3,"good tips, already knew most of","It's a good book for beginners but with my obsession with fashion magazines, i already knew most of the information."
3,Possible title confusion,"The ISBN listed for Harlequin Superromance No. 458, title Satin Whispers, for this author, goes to this book, Lady's Choice. It is unclear if there were two books or a variant title."
5,One of the best for your Latin collection,"This is one of the best latin bands ever, what else can I say? Even the recently rediscovered guys ""Buena Vista social Club""-and they are excellent musicians-are no match for Lobo y Melon!"
5,My tape of choice,"Doing some research on tapes, I found this is an outstanding bargain! For my Sony 340 Digital8 camera, I found there are three basic types of tapes. Standard grade, Metal Particle, and Metal Evaporated. These are Metal Evaporated tapes, and have paid up to 4 times this price for these elsewhere. They are not easy to find cheaply! If you're interested in transferring digital recordings to make DVDs, this is the best tape you can buy."
3,so so,"This is not a bad thing, but the protractor function, which is the main reason I bought it, is not that easy to use and is not all that precise. The ruler is nice. Using this as a T-square is not practical. I would say if you can get by with something less than exacting, this is probably not bad."
3,why it don't work.,"It wasn't bad for sharpening twist drills but the arm for the protractor was riveted off center so it couldn't be used for any of is functions. This piece is also made in inda,not usa, for those concerned of that"
3,An interesting gizmo,"This device may have many uses. However, it's really little more than toy. It is only suitable for rough work. Highly recommended as a socking stuffer for that budding engineer."
4,I take pride in keeping my trombone very clean and well-maintained.,"This is the first brush I have ever had that can reach the curve of my outer slide. Since the Brass-Saver Trombone Brush is all plastic and contains no metal, it cannot scratch my instrument. I plan to recommend this brush to a fellow community band member who is very concerned that he does not scratch his new slide when cleaning it. Tomorrow, I plan to use it on some of my F-attachment tubing (I have an older trombone with a ""closed"" wrap attachment). I will see if it will work there, I recommend this brush for those of you who really want to reach every nook and cranny of your horns."
5,Definitely the best book on Abe and Ann!,This was an excellent book regarding the story of Lincoln and Ann Rutledge! Logical and concise--well worth the read! And I like the fact it doesn't bash Mary Todd Lincoln. The two relationships were at different times with different Lincolns---apples and oranges!
4,nice,I just bought this and it is great for both my kids. My son complains we walk too much and the double stroller is too small for his height. My only complain it is we live in apartment on the 3rd floor and the door isnt wide enough for the cruiser to go thru. So i have to take the wheels and the top apart to fit thru the door. But I i love it. it goes over bumps smoothly.
3,"Not up to par with other used ""mint"" suppliers","I've bought a *lot* of used balls off eBay over the years, and these simply aren't up to the standard set by eBay suppliers like LostGolfBalls and others (virtually anyone with a 99.5+% positive rating has been the same in my experience).Roughly a third of the 36 ""mint"" balls I bought here are either slightly yellowed, have a small scuff or two, or other such imperfections, and in every ""mint"" shipment I've ever bought off eBay, if there were 2 such balls in a batch of 36, it was an anomaly. It certainly won't affect the play of the ball, but these would rank as ""AAA""/""Near Mint"" rather than ""AAAA""/""Mint"" as advertised.Make your purchasing decisions accordingly."
4,Great price for Titleist NXT,"If you don't mind playing with balls with logos on them, this is a great deal. The logos don't bother me and I prefer them, since it appears that these are the ones that are practically new. Beats paying the high dollar for the Titleist NXT, which is the ball that seems to offer great control"
3,Not exactly as described,"These balls are not in the shape that they're described. They are dis-colored and have scuffs on the majority of them. The balls seem to be deaden or have been hit to death at one point. Basically better off going to WalMart and grabbing the sack of balls for 11 bucks rather than getting basically the same quality for 30....First time buying these recycled balls and probably won't be doing it again. Even though the NXT is a better quality ball and this is a good price/ball, they seem to have all the life taken out of them so your better off just buying brand new Top Flite's."
3,More defects (25%) than expected,I realize these are recycled golf balls but finding 9 balls with scratches deep enough to affect the roll of the putts is unexpected. There was one other ball that is brownish in color. Rest of the balls are good shape. A postive blindspot is to find some NXTTOUR balls in the mix.
4,"Great deal, will buy again","Balls came in as expected, very clean with most in excellent shape, maybe 1 or 2 feeling a little 'rough'. These aren't new balls so anybody complaining about putter lines or corporate logos...c'mon man. I will be buying this pack again once I get low.One thing I did notice about these is that I do not get a lot of loft from them. They tended to fly low, 'line drives', but they did stay fairly straight - recommended for the high flying shanker, which I often am.Recommended - the ball type and this pack deal, great deal. Will be buying again."
3,more logos than I expected,"The quality of the golf balls is certainly very good. However, if you don't want to play golf balls with random company logos, these are not for you. at least half of the balls had logos on them."
3,Golf Balls,Delivery was prompt. Quality of the balls are good not great. Distance is good. I probably can use for two rounds before discarding.
2,Interesting,"This book had some interesting projects and to date, I have not tried one. Glad I have it for inspiration."
4,"cats, cats, cats","this is the best book for the cat lover. I even found a pattern inside for dogs. My mother and I worked on these projects together. we have created numerous pillows, and wall hangings useing this book."
4,Brit's Lady Shines,Kit Dee's adventure set in the Southwest depicts the compelling life of Calista Warwick and Britton Chance. Twists and plot changes hold your interest as Dee spins a literary web. A must read.
3,What's with the d.o.t.s.?,"While Brit's Lady is a fast-paced romance, it's sort of like eating fast food in that it's also unmemorable. The hero and heroine have possibilities, the story has possibilities, but an over-the-top villain and an over-exhuberant. . . use . . . of . . . dots, especially in the love scenes, render the story just a tad less than average.The rendering of Indian live, though, and the weaving in of historical figure Geronimo, is better than in many Indian romances. There's no ""Tonto-speak,"" thank goodness! But while this part of the story seems realistic, the remainder does not.I read this book the same week I read Lorraine Heath's Never Love a Cowboy. In comparison, this pales dreadfully. My recommendation? Go for the Heath and you won't be disappointed.TTFN, Laurie Likes BooksPublisher, All About Romance"

5,A Classic Bollywood Super Hit,"Vijay Arora is a superstar in this classic Bollywood 1970's hit movie with the famous song ""Chura Liya"" with Zeenat Aman and Vijay Arora. A must see for everyone of Indian heritage."
3,"Hippie, Hippie, Bollywood","This film was made in 1973 which was a period when Indian film makers & musicians were doing a lot of experimenting, copying of western styles, and generally trying to find themselves. This film has elements of Elvis movies, hippie movies, gangster movies, you name it. Plus a couple of great songs. The acting is basically awful, the editing bites, the cinematography -arrgh ! It is NOT a good movie, but it IS entertaining."
1,Disappointed.,I'm a Calphalon addict. This is the first item I've ever returned. One convenience was that is was shipped from Macy's so I simply returned the item to the store.
5,007 and cash. Wow!,"I bought this tape as a gift for my son and I ended up listening to it twice already. It's packed with realistic techniques to add excitement, if not total change to, one's life. The money techniques alone are worth it."
5,I'm Ready!,"It doesn't take money, like I thought to ""live the James Bond lifestyle."" I just needed this advise to be pushed to clean up my act and be cool and confident. It's not about money, it's a style, mind-set."
1,AUDIO TAPE - NOT A BOOK,JUST MAKE SURE YOU REALISE THIS IS AN AUDIO TAPE OF POOR QUALIY AND NOT A BOOK AS IT LOOKS LIKE!
2,Tomorrow Never Dies - but this tape does,"Did the author have all of his friends write in to give a review? The concept of wrapping a motivational tape up with the James Bond lifestyle is a good one. Unfortunately the execution of this concept was pretty poor.The author suggests that the lifestyle costs money, yet its a shame that he did not invest it in this tape. A professional narrator should have been hired instead of the author. Also many on the suggestions of how to be a James Bond type are almost laughable. Bond is about real confidence, not about throwing around money. Any motivational tape that does not realize this, does not know the character. Remember 'Nobody does it better"".More time and effort short have been spent on his product."
5,A little style goes a long way...,"...style and sophistication go ALL the way. Kyriazi inspires cool confidence in the average Joe by reminding him that to win the world you must first play a winner. By using the familiar image and antics of every real man's alter ego, James Bond, Kyriazi contrasts mediocrity with wild success, conquest, and adventure. He eloquently details the simple steps neccessary to achieve goals in life by essentially playing the part of Bond in one's own movie. I came away from this tape inspired to conquer my own fears and approach life with with sophistication, class, and a swagger. I belive any man, no matter how ""Bondified"" already, can benefit from the author's advice and insight."
2,Did not Really Get Into This,"I bought this as an ebook from Fictionwise, and annoyingly found it was number two in a series (and misdescribed too). However, having read it, I feel no great compulsion to go back and read book one.It would be hard to find this story's niche. The language - whilst not terrible - is strong enough in places to make this a young adult rather than a children's book, but the story was simplistic - almost turgid. Basically the protagonist is an 18 year old lad who has discovered he is secretly a witch prince. His mother has been kidnapped and he has a lot to learn about his father.Maybe it was that I had not started this series at the beginning, but it really did not captivate me in the slightest. The celtic connection was tenuous, and the overall concept was unconvincing."
2,Author is suspect,"After the fraud Belleisles perpetuated in his Arming America book, I must confess that I read Revolutionary Outlaws with a more than sceptical eye. It is well written, but I find myself wondering if I can trust this author again."
5,Passion is still alive,"I loved Mors Syphilitica's last CD ""Primrose"", it was a dark, passionate and romantic album. When I first heard ""Feather and Fate"", I was stunned at how the band had progressed and matured. I thought they couldn't be more romantic than they were with ""Primrose"", but this album seems to have even more love put in to it than their previous albums. The songwriting is more elaborate than before, yet at times it seems more stripped-down and simple...There are some really straightforward songs. The CD is not as goth rock as before, but more ethereal/indie/shoegaze/folk/middle-eastern...I don't know what to call it, it's just beautiful."
2,totally disappointed...sigh,"I was really expecting this CD to be much better. I had heard Virgin Widows and really loved it, but the rest of the album is mostly a let down. I would say overall there are only 3 descent songs, and the rest is mediocre at best. There seems to be a strange lack of genuine energy and passion, and the production is very, very poor. Maybe this is because the label didn't have the money to spend or maybe the band does their own recording in a bedroom closet? They really need help with the mixing...the vocals get so muddy and forced sometimes. I know there is lovely music in here, but the production just doesn't bring it out. That would be fine for low-fi indie rock, but this sort of ""beauty"" music really begs for a richer, fuller sound. After all the wonderful reviews I was really shocked and disappointed...wish I could get my money back. Oh well. Live and learn."
3,mainstream orchestral music,"I picked up a copy of this, out of curiosity, at the public library.I was very much hoping it would be ""Latin"" music of one flavor or another - Mexican, Carribean, Salsa, Mariachi, anything! And, now and then it has a bit of latin spice. But by and large, it's quite pedestrian orchestral music. Maybe Chucho is the Percy Faith of Mexico.If it's well-enough-executed elevator music you're after, you probably wouldn't be disappointed. But this isn't a ""Latin experience"" of any kind. Even the Latin songs are done Gringo-style, mostly."
3,Please release this in a restored DVD!,"I remember seeing this in a little theater that they have at the Sun Valley Lodge in Sun Valley. It was a hoot to see, and some great period stuff of the resort etc..Of course great footage of the Glenn Miller Orchestra. The skiing scenes look ridiculous, but given the primitive nature of the equipment they had back then its amazing that they could ski on that stuff at all! But over all this is a great film, but it deserves a full restoration and re-release in DVD form."
3,Something's missing...,"Am I the only who has noticed that, in remixing the soundtrack stem recordings for true stereo, portions of the music tracks are missing? Like The Modernaires' harmonies during ""I Know Why"" and a good part of the finale? It's beyond annoying, and incomprehensible that this could make it past the video's producers. Pray God they fix this for the inevitable DVD reissue! Otherwise, an enjoyable piece of escapist fluff, although ""Orchestra Wives"" showcases the Miller band to optimum advantage."
2,Sun Valley Serenade,"Finally another great film to DVD. This is one of the Best films of the early 40's with The Glenn Miller Band. Sonja Henie, John Payne, Milton Berle and many great old stars. Bringing back good memories of motion pictures of the 40's. Glenn Miller plays his greatest selections, Chattanooga choo choo, In the Mood and I Know Why. You will be dazzled with Sonja Henies skating. You will also be dazzled with the great stereo sound and excellent picture quality. I rate this film the best 5 starsI hope this film will be presented in it's original full screen format."
5,PLEASE PUT ON DVD,"This is one of my favorite ""feel good"" movies of all time. A lot of fun (with a YOUNG Milton Berle) and some of the BEST mucic ever filmed. Have a heart and bring this out!!!!"
5,Fast-paced collection of ongoing action and battles.,"Marc Gascoigne and Christian Dunn edit TALES FROM THE DARK MILLENNIUM, an anthology of short stories set in the Pyrus Reach Sector, which is under attack from the hordes of Chaos. It's up to humanity to defend their world - but the challenges prove unending in this fast-paced collection of ongoing action and battles."
2,"Great, except for the Goto of course.","As a fan of the Black Library I enjoyed many of the stories in this book, however, I would stay clear of any book with any material Goto, and here's why:As an Eldar fan, I will tell you firsthand that his work is AIMED to be offensive to my demographic. His depictions of the Eldar are grossly against the fluff, and always are aimed to belittle them and their fans.Also, his depictions of women are absolutely disgusting. He has no respect for the female gender and displays them as weak and pitiful. By the end of any of his work, any female character, especially if Eldar will meet a slow, humiliating and painful end.In short, don't go for the Black Library collaborations. I like short stories, too, but it's not worth supporting a man like Goto for."
3,The Pity of it All,"The book itself is very interesting and mind-opening. But in some parts it is too estensive and repetitive, which makes it too long. Anyhow it is enlightening and worth-while reading."
4,More Storyteller than Scholar,"While Boorstin won the Pulitzer Prize for this book, it's odd that he plays loose with the facts. He absolutely is a gifted storyteller, but sad to say, that sometimes comes at the expense of historical accuracy. Do not rely on his account of facts as the end of the story. Read other writers, compare, and get a broader perspective on the era. Boorstin's weakness is that once he comes up with a theme, in this case, democracy, he edits the facts to fit with his preconceived storyline. That keeps a book interesting, but it doesn't necessary describe reality. Life is messy.Another assumption that creeps in is that the author assumes everyone is as materialistic as he is. He attributes motives to people that may not have been present. Boorstin was in an affluent society. The era he writes about was not as prosperous. His assumptions blind him to historical context. Overall this book is an interesting read, I'm just not convinced of the validity."
5,A benchmark in macro history texts.,The author takes the reader to the heart of history; the people. He finds the people who may be obscure but their role in the story he tells serve to make us realize their really is an American spirit. Kudos to Boorstin and the people he portrays
2,Speaks foreign tongues,"Sturdy but no very useful to home user due to hole size descriptions that do not match common home drill bit size descriptions, like 1/16 inch and 3/8 inch, etc. Used for target practice and found something else I can read and relate to my drill bit sets."
3,No Installation Sheet,"The Model FD-30CD radio offers quality sound and variety of options but comes without adequate information on proper installation. Suggest this missing data be supplied to customers at the time of purchase. At present, it is necessary to purchase installation information from another vendor for $50+ dollars. This is not acceptable."
3,If all you want is a bag that looks fashionable,"I wanted this bag because it looks so stylish and not like the typical diaper bag. Well, it is stylish but I don't find it to be of good quality. The extras like the make up bag, changing pad, and cell phone case were a nice addition. However, I had problems with the zipper and attaching the carrying strap was quite the task (the clasp to attach it couldn't get around the loops on the side very well at all) I didn't think it was going to go on at all. For the price I had basically just hoped for not just a stylish styled bag but for one that wouldn't be cheaply made."
3,SO cute but already falling apart at the seams,"I read the reviews on this bag and was prepared for it to break down eventually but I have only used it for 4 days now and I noticed the liner for one of the pockets has already torn away at the seam. So basically, as I reached for my cell phone, I reached into the seam and not the actual pocket where my cell phone is. I was surprised, to say the least. I LOVE the look of this bag and I have gotten TONS of compliments on it alreay in the 4 days that I've used it, but it seems to be cheaply made. I'm not hard on my bags but hey, I'm a mom, and my bags get reached into MANY times a day. I have a Petunia Picklebottom bag that I usually use but wanted a less ""delicate"" bag. I guess I'll have to be delicate with this one too!"
3,Utility Tweezers,"These tweezers are decent. Not the best, not the worst. I purchased them for working on models and electrical components. They are a bit stiffer on the tweeze than I would prefer and bigger than expected. Depending on what you intend to use these for I would shop around if you are looking for something a bit more delicate."
1,Too big,This tool is too big to do anything. I bought it for my framing and roofing crew. They used it a few times and tossed it aside.
5,Quality cable,"I thought because of the low price, this cable might be a knock-off or something. Got it in and it works just fine. I connect it from my HDMI connection on my comp. to the DVI connnection on my 1080i TV."
2,"DVI HDMi cable, Monster","Used for Blue Ray video. Excellent cable, made by Monster. Comes in a generic bag."
5,Riveting!,"History repeats itself. ""When Technology Fails' is a truly riveting and thoroughly researched book of significant technological disasters, accidents and failures of the 20th century. It offers a variety of failure case-studies in key areas such a aircraft, airships, automobiles, bridges, submarines and more. It explores the tragic consequences of product failure and the economic and sociological fallout associated with them. There is a healthy mix of contributing authors from university professors, engineers, pilots, consultants and freelance journalists. Each chapter ends with a references section to inform the reader where they could find out more about the particular incident, which happens to be the part I appreciate most about the book. I would highly recommend a practicing engineer to keep this stocked on a shelf to preserve important historical lessons learned from other disasters."
4,A great catalog,This was a perfect deal. Clear description and a shipment with no problems. Communication was not a problem. This catalog could be better if it has brought more pictures.
4,everything covered,It is amazing to see every single matchbox diecast ever made into production grouped under one title. You can easily assess the value of your cars and hit the road to find precious collectables with this very usefull guide.
3,fun but not satisfied,"the pyrite nuggets, or ""fools gold"" looks nothing whats on the box or as i remember it when i was a kid. The child i bought this for was excited to dig for the gold as he has had dinosaur excavation kits before and realy enjoyd those. He had fun digging for the pyrite but when he saw the first piece he dug out he was not happy with it. his comment was ""that doesnt even look like gold, you cant fool anyone with that."" That came from a five year old.So it is fun digging but the pieces look more like a plain rock with a little bit of gold paint on them."
3,misleading product box and description,My boys enjoyed mining for gold but the gold that they mined was nothing like the picture on the box or the instructions. They look like tarnished dice. They are cubes not nuggets.
3,It's okay.,This is a quick activity you can do with your kids. They will enjoy it but you won't get more than one use out of it.
5,Great,"I bought this item for my dad since he would like to go dig for gold someday. My 5 year old Neice ended up doing most of the work on this toy, and she absolutly loved it. She started on Sunday and found 3 peices. Monday morning she did not want to go to school because she wanted to look for more gold. Normally she losses interrest in things very quickly, So I was very surprised this kept her interrest. She did finish on Monday with a real hammer. Much to my surprise there were 12 separate peices of fools gold in the brick we received! Package say's you only get 6pcs. She was so proud that she found them all that she put them in the velvet bag that came with it and took it to school the next day to show all her friends. The product did put off alot of dust. We did it on spread out newspaper, and I tied a scarf around her face so she wouldn't breath in dust. Saftey glasses a must. Highly recommend for all ages."
1,"great idea for a book, but this one was unsuccessful","I will keep this short. This book had a lot of what I call the ""duh"" factor. Keep your kids away from sharp objects, and away from hot stoves etc. Things I already had thought of. I had hoped that this book would give me insight on things I had never thought of and new ways to prevent anything from happening to my baby. Luckily I bought it used. Not really worth the $6 I paid for it. If you are completely clueless on how to be careful with your children, then this book is for you. Otherwise, if you have any common sense you don't need it."
5,Great product,Tone's does a great job with their base products. They are not as salty asbouillion cubes and are less expensive than canned broths. I keep them inmy pantry at all times. I can recommend.
3,Helpful as a soup starter or gravy maker,"Nutrition facts per 1 tsp serving:calories 15, calories from fat 5,total fat 0.5g, cholesterol less than 5 mg,sodium 770mg,total carbohydrate 2g,protein less than 1 gThere are helpful tables and amounts on the label for stock or broth - one cup, one quart, one gallon, and five gallons and also for gravy - one pint, one quart, one gallon, and four gallons. It has ugly gray,silver plastic packaging.This works well as a soup starter or gravy maker. I would not recommend it as something that you would mix with hot water and drink, though. I do not like it for that nearly as much as I like Better Than Bouillon chicken base."
5,Alien Face Lapel Pin - Great,"Purchased through Amazon.Great Product, good quality ... fast shipping ... good pricingI wish that there was a greater selection of different color Alien faces.Measures 3/4""x1""Hope this was helpful.- JH"
4,Endurance,I really enjoyed this movie. Its absolutly amazing watching Haile run in the 1996 Olympic Games. I wish it would have showed more races of his but all in all it was an awsome movie and I would highly recommend it for anyone to watch.
2,passion,I was a long distance runner and i admire this particular runner and the goals he achieved and dreams he had.
5,Endurance [VHS],The video was in good condition the viewing was excellent. I will share it with friends and grandchildren. There were many lessons learned from this video. Enduring with a positive attitude is #1. Using all our resources to maintain a healthy life style.never give up on a dream. Love endures in all circumstances.
4,Somewhat deceiving,"The only drawback of this movie is that it is somewhat deceiving. The movie gives the viewer the impression that Gebr was isolated from the rest of the world and won the Oly 10,000 as an unknown. Coming into the Atlanta Olympics, Gebr was the HEAVY favorite to win the 10,000. He had competed alot in the European track circuit prior to 96 and had multiple world records on his resume coming into Atlanta. Everyone in the track world knew who Gebr was and if anyone other than he would have won the 10,000, it would have been a MAJOR upset. Some footage of Gebr's WR performances would have made this movie a bit more accurate."
4,Very solid and enjoyable CD,"Toni Price - Midnight PumpkinThere are several reviews already for this CD and all rate it high for good reason. There is a lot to like here. Fine playing from all aboard with special mention for James Burton and Derek O'Brien. So nice to hear James picking beautifully. This is just a great crew of musicians who lay it down so well. The star of the show though is certainly Toni Price who sings with authority and total confidence. She never strains for a note and sings so smooth and sweet, bringing to mind Bonnie Raitt and Stevie Nicks to me.Summary - fine playing, great songs, nice variety and top notch singing. Recommended."
5,Just keeps getting better,"I ""came of age"" in Austin and have pretty high standards for this music, in fact it took a long time for Toni Price to grow on me, but honestly, she just keeps getting better and better. Maybe it's the great song selection or the amiable but top-flight musicianship, but there's something special about this one. Gives me the chills, and makes me homesick for the Continental Club. Next Tuesday night I'm in Austin, you'll know where to find me. --LW"
5,Very Good Collection,"I knew Caldwell's music since I was very young. Back then I used to listened to You Promised Me. I followed all his albums until recently his anthology was released. This 2nd part Anthology IMHO has better selection than the 1st one. Simply because I just don't like the songs. But in this 2nd volume most of my fav are here!It's nice to hear again What You Won't Do For Love. This time in original version. Then 6 songs from ""Heart of Mine"". Wow! Overall it's a really good selection of his greatest hits.I really missed songs like Sherry, Carry On,You Promised Me and Puerto Rico (from OMPS Salsa) which were not included on both Anthologies. Those 4 are among my all-time fav."
5,Good quality.,"I don't have a method to measure the accuracy of the tool, but ""0"" fits very nicely. It came perfectly adjusted, and it will be easy to re-calibrate in case of damage or wear."
4,"Sensitive, tense, ahead of its time","Sensitive portrayal almost with more tension perhaps knowing it was addressing a relationship barely dealt with at the time and breaking much new ground even tentatively but honestly and, for the most part thoroughly."
4,Hard to beat,"""Personal Best"" is all about extending yourself to the limit and taking matters into your own hands. It still stands up after all these years. The lasting memories of this movie will always give me something to hold on to; it is just as stimulating as it was in 1982, right up to the climax."
1,My Nomination for the Worst Sports Movie of the 1980's,"I look at this movie from two prospectives. First, I was an extra in the movie. (I was one of the runners warming up during the track scenes and was also in the crowd) and even though I appreciated the good pay, knew it would suck just from watching it being filmed. Later at the ""premier"" I had to stifle my groans from all the bad acting. If you want to make a point about it being about lesbians that was ahead of the curve, fine, I just wish Hollywood would have picked a different subject matter and not have filmed it in Eugene. Save your money."
3,Interesting drama,Set in the 70s. A story about athletes traing for the Moscow Olympic Games. It focuses on 2 women and their relationship
5,Excellent Movie,"It is an oldie but a goodie with life-lessons, by example, still good today in any set of close relationships. Optimism and drive lead us to make our own performance today a little better than it was yesterday."
5,I Love it!,I can see why this movie is on the list of favorites. It was very moving and showed the extreme emotions that love causes. I would highly recommend it.
3,I remembered this movie to be better than it was,"When Personal Best came out in 1982, at about the same time as Chariots of Fire - another running movie - I loved it. But seeing it again, it's lost something. Now, all I see is Mariel Hemingway whining and crying through the whole movie. I think what caught me the first time was the great photography, Mariel's hot bod, and Scott Glenn's great lines about comparing coaching the women's team to Chuck Noll coaching the Pittsburgh Steelers. All three are still great. Just don't expect much else."
3,When Mariel was Hot,"Bizarre title, I know, but this was a good movie, back before Mariel got implants, became a slut. I saw it years ago, liked the overall content of the movie, the lesbian scenes, and the comic parts, (holding her boyfriends part while he pees to see what it is like to pee standing up) .... I enjoyed the frustrations, knowing how it related to the super competitiveness, in sports and the olympics. At all costs .... Good movie"
2,"Shining moments too few, but a good concept","Great concept, but, some of the acting was marginal. Hemingway had some good moments, but she's just not a great actress. The story about the women - which was incidental to the sports story - was good...but what the he11 was up with the man in the end with Hemingway's character?? And the peeing scene??? Please. Overall, if you can deal with the ""80'sness"" of it, it was somewhat of a landmark in lesbian film making in it's time."
5,top quqlity,"I WAS A LITTLE SKEPTICAL ON BUYING ON LINE BUT IT WAS EASY FRIENDLY AND MOST OF ALL SECURE IT WAS A PLEASURABLE EXPERIENCE AND IM LOOKING FORWARD IN DOING IT AGAIN.AS FAR AS THE PRODUCT I BOUGHT IT WAS IN EXELLENT CONDITION AND SO WAS THE PACKAGING I RECIEVED IT A LOT FASTER THAN ADVERTISED AND HASSLE FREE.EXELLENT PEOPLE TO DEAL WITH. I WORK IN THE SERVICE AND WARRANTY FIELD AND KNOW HOW IMPORTANT PRESENTATION IS,THIS IS ALWAYS SOMETHING I LOOK FOR AND NOTICE ABOUT ANY ITEMS I BUY.GREAT JOBGUYS AND KEEP UP THE HONESTY AND INTEGRETY WORK.THIS WORKS FOR YOU AND ALL OTHERS ONLINE SHOULD EXERCISE YOU POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THANKSDANNY PINEAU"
4,Teacher Recommends This Game,"I purchased this game for my 5th grade class to go along with an embryology project. My class loves this game! An alternate way to play the game (without the game board) is to read a question to the entire class and ask the students who choose one answer to stand - those who don't may stay seated. I was stumped on a few answers, too!"
5,Very Impressive and Extremely Interesting!,I would like you to know I was impressed with this book and the copious amount of research and supporting information provided. It is well worth the money and time to read. You will find something amazing and surprising on every page. It is easy enough to read and comprehend what the author is telling you...
5,Patrick is a gift from God.,It wouldn't matter if you had 1 million degrees what Patrick Cooke points out is the truth. Im thankful he covers all possibilities. I don't call that misleading. The people who gave us the Bible had all kinds of degrees too and they gave us a bunch of blurred BS and cut out information. The Bible is a highly flawed book of truth and I thank God for Patrick opening my eyes and changing my life.
1,Wrong Picture,"I am extremely unhappy and dissapointed with this product and how it is advertised. I look at the picture of the product and see a metal caliper. and for over $8 it should be metal, plastic ones run abundant in the $3-4 range. I open the box and voilah!! PLASTIC. I cannot vent my frustration over this clearly enough and can't believe Amazon or the seller would try to mislead people to this extent. Since Amazon is the seller and shipper of this product it annoys me even further. http://www.amazon.com/General-Tools-132ME-English-Sliding/dp/B00004T7UG/ref=pd_sim_hi_4 This is the caliper I was expecting Amazon. Please remove that picture."
2,What The Hell Happened......?,"I like LFO, I even saw them in concert in 2000 andthey were great. However, what the hell happened onthis album? I mean there are a few good cuts, but theseguys are trying to be balladeers and not pop singers, Imean really, how can these guys sing about love whenall they want to do is party? Come on guys, bring backthe partiers of LFO and leave the lovers of LFO intheir own pathetic lives, listening to their radios andwishing they had a man/woman instead of actually goingout and meeting someone.."
5,life sure is good,This album is a must have for any lfo fan. All the tracks are really good and the photos in the cd are also really good. They have a hiden track after the original track 13. It is a great song along with all the others. I would buy this album all over again knowin how great it is now.
1,Only one good song,"Every Other Time is a great pop tune, but the rest of the album is seriously subpar. If you like the single Every Other Time, just get the single. The rest of the album is not worth the effort."
1,horrible,"I also listened to the songs before the Cd was released- and I didn't want to buy it at all! The songs are just [...]-especially the hidden track,no.69 now I know why it was a HIDDEN one(which, by the way, is called *Suzie's* pillow).No one should waste a second to listen to it. The guy on that songs doesn't seem to know that he CAN'T SING!?!? I had to give them 1 Star rating because there's no -10"
1,total cheeze,lfo's debut was way better than this poor excuse for pop music. this cd lacks both lyrically and musically. each and every song is loaded with cheesy lyrics. it's annoying.
5,LIFE IS GREAT!!!!!!!!I MEAN GREAT!,"I read everyone eles reviews and they said they liked the cd I totally loved it. I like every song on the cd, but I sort of don't like Erase Her but it is growing on me. Dandelion is my favorite song, but all the songs are great. Life is good, the song on the cd totally kicks butt. Truthly all the songs kick butt on this cd, LFO has a great cd on their hands. I suggest you go out and buy this cd you wont regret it I promise :)!!!!! I mean it cause I was never a real fan of LFO now I totally love them!!!!"
3,A so-so second effort,"""Life is Good"" should definitely set LFO apart from the ""boy band"" mold that critics have been so eager to include them in. Unfortunately, the charm of the hit single ""Summer Girls"" from their self-titled debut is not found on LFO's second album."
4,lfo life is good,LFO is a great group whith there new albums make them beteras a group there righting more song for there albums and othergoups.keep up your good work
3,summer girl,i think this CD is wunderfull. me and my friends still hear this song.thanks mabie i'll write something soon. bye !!
4,LFO is Back.......,"LFO is back and kicking with a GREAT new album! I think that the new album is a little bit different then their last one,but it's better!It's a little more upbeat,but still their style!!! I like the songs on the album you can hear that they have grown a little bit older and wiser!!! SO LFO fans kick it with this GREAT new album!"
5,Love this CD,"Hey I just got this CD today and it's great. It's so great that it's hard to choose a favorite. I love all the songs, but ""Life Is Good"" has to be my favorite. It's such a happy song. Life is good!!! I was listening to the CD and I saw that it my computer said this CD was 71 min and 46 sec long. I was like what? So I scaned the CD. It has 69 tracks. 15-68 are nothing they are blank and about 12 sec longs. 69 is a bonus track called ""Weeping Willow"". It's a great song. I just knew that there a bonus track. Why else would they put 54 empty tracks? This CD is awsome. It's defenitly one you should get if want a CD with good beats and rockin lyrics. And plus all the songs are written by LFO themselves. Mostly Rich."
2,it should have been alot better,"having heard the band right when they first came around i was hooked to there first EP. They had energy to burn and tight rythms that sound good even crammed in 2 and a half minute songs. Here though there debut full length falls flat. meandering guitar riffs, flat chorus' and poor drumming. There no real bite and some probablly have already said that there a poor mans E Town Concrete. The newly recorded version of ""headless"" sucks and the earnesty level here is pretty high. It sounds far too much like washed out nu metal than the impression they gave me the first go around. The drumming and the singing though particularly is what real drowns the album out. the drumming is poorly structured and the vocals go from shouting and ""gang vocals"" (bitted right off of hatebreeed for sure) to flat harmonies by the time they reach the chorus'. it shouldve been alot better"
3,Would be better if music not sampled.,"There is a cut on this CD called T-Bone Shuffle. This is nothing more than a rip-off of a good friend and fellow musician from St. Louis. The late Albert King released this in 1962 as a song called ""Natural Ball"" That's not right. I know that trying to do SRV type stuff, and being from TX seems cool, but don't steal songs, rename them, and claim them as your own.Thunderfoot Briggs"
1,Cheap Grill Cover,Do not buy this grill cover. It is made of cheap material that tears easily. It didn't last 3 days on my grill before ripping. It does not stay on grill very well at all either.
1,Do Not Buy This!!,"I bought this for my husband who is a huge Browns fan for Christmas. It is already broken. The material is similiar to a poncho. The cold made the plastic brittle and break into many pieces. Once the wind caught it, the cover was done. Do Not Buy this item!!!"
1,Don't waste your time,"Apparently Vietnam is changing rapidly; rapidly enough for this book to be completely out of date.I downloaded this book for Kindle so that I would have a comprehensive guide as I trekked through Hanoi alone. But, as I would soon come to find out, not only is this book useless on Kindle because of the way in which the maps are hard to navigate - the images completely cut off in some cases, and hard to return to the write up that you were initially reading about - but the book is so out of date that most of the restaurants, cafes, hotels that it guides you to, no longer exist!Hanoi is not an easy city to navigate. Especially if it is your first time to Asia. Thus, if you are looking for a guide book that will actually guide you, this one is worthless. I've learned my lesson: I'm sticking to Roughguide."
2,Really Disappointing,"I've used Lonely Planet guidebooks a handful of times in the past, and though I'm not the biggest fan, they're generally pretty reliable and helpful. This guidebook is quite the opposite. So far, I've only used it in Ho Chi Minh City, and it's been worse than useless. Some of the suggestions are helpful, but often, the information is just flat out wrong. Addresses and phone numbers for a handful of their recommendations are incorrect and in fact sent us in the wrong direction entirely. Other times, the suggestions don't exist at all. I understand that things may change quickly in this city, but this book isn't particularly old, and the restaurants and other sites for which it had incorrect information clearly predate the publication of this book. So whatever you do, don't buy this book."
4,Great travel guide,"We used this Lonely Planet guide for 2 weeks in southern Vietnam. My friend had the Rough Guide and we relied much more heavily on my LP. It was informative, had good maps, and we enjoyed most of the recommendations. I have used other Loney Planet guides in the past and this one was another useful travel tool. Amazon had the best price by far."
3,Lonely Planet Vietnam,"We bought this book on Kindle because we thought how useful to have a guide in a light weight form. In Practice we found much of the guide became impractical - maps for instance were split across up to four pages and even using the zoom function were nigh on impossible to understand. Then referring to the related text and back to the map became a chore.Maybe I am not sufficiently educated in navigating forward and backward searching with Kindle, if you want to refer back to something finding where that item is is difficult.The sections on restaurants in Saigon and Hanoi was useful, we found most of the listed venues and were happy with the recommendations. The sections on sites to see also worked.However, in general we decided that a hardcopy with dogeared pages and other markings would be easier to use.Novels and biographies are good on Kindle but I suspect anything with diagrams or maps are going to have problems."
2,Out of date and inadequate,"I've been using this latest edition of the Vietnam LP during my current trip to Saigon, Nha Trang, Hue and Hanoi. I've found it to be inadequate. Maps provide misinformation, hotel and restaurant information is completely out of date, and choices seem arbitrary. LP dominates the travel guide book market, but they leave a lot to be desired."
3,Best used as guide for hotels.,"I used the Lonely Planet Vietnam as a guide to hotels and shopping on a recent trip to Saigon and Phan Rang. The information was correct and up to date. I felt some of the guide could have been better, but it is still worth the money. Of course it puts the most effort into places that most tourist will go."
2,Read this when you want to fall asleep,"Another mystery to solve by the mathematically-minded Japanese duo - but is it worth reading about? I don't think so. The author describes his locations in better detail than his protagonists so the only feel I have for Morimoto and his assistant Suzuki is intelligent calm. And a story without some stress is a dull one. I appreciate the humor as overeager insurance agent Sasaki tries to help the investigation but by and large I find this story as boring as the first. No action, some travel and lots of clever, logical thinking. The author improved his writing style a bit but it's still a series that I won't bother to continue with. Again I see generic 5 star reviews given to help sales at Amazon. I know why it's done but I find it annoying enough to write a negative review."
5,food for thought,I find Ian to be one of the few well educated who is willing to go out on a limb and propose ideas that the mainstream in America laugh at. This is a very good book.
5,"I haven't eaten a bite, or slept for 3 days and nights","30 years after its original release, this holds up for me as one of Rosanne's best ... I waver between this, 'Seven Year Ache' and 'King's Record Shop' as my favourite of her pre-Interiors work. The musicianship on Third Rate Romance, with the perfectly cheesy (in a good way) organ and steel guitar, puts that track on level footing with The Amazing Rhythm Aces original. And Johnny Cash's (uncredited) vocals on That's How I Got to Memphis nicely bookend his appearance, years later, on September When It Comes, from Rosanne's 'Rules of Travel'."
2,poor product for the price,Instructions state that product can be used to magnetize wrenches. Hole through which item passes for magnetizing is just about the size of a pencil. This product doesn't have many uses. I tried to magnetize some screwdrivers and the result was pretty poor. None of the screwdrivers had enough magnetization to change the nature in a real positive way.
4,Great story... is it all true?,"I am a major fan of Jesse Owens, and this film is definitely for fans. Dorian Harewood portrays Jesse very well, but almost in a god-like perfection. Of course, biographies are supposed to emphasize good qualities, but this film leaves you wondering if Jesse Owens had any bad ones. Still a very good film, and an excellent way to introduce people who don't know about him to a great role model, a great athlete and world class human."
4,Good solid film,Jesse Owens is a Hero.he stood Hate in the Face&Looked it down and was a Champion not only of Sport but of Human Rights.Dorian Harewood a Good Actor who i have seen in countless films does a solid job here.
4,long but good and educational,"Jesses lets people call him Jesse instead of JC becuase he does not want to cause trouble. I admired that he focused on the job that needed to be done and did not worry about being black.A German athlete observes Jesse help a Mexican athlete do better. Later, the German athlete helps Jesses when he realizes that the judges attempt to DQ Jesses for jumping too late.A couple scenes are out of context because they show people in a spotlight with no background.Much of the move takes place after the Olympics."
5,Real story about the life of Jesse Owens,This is one of the films I seen. It has good information that discusses about the late Olympic great Jesse Owens. I think everybody should see this film 'cuz it's a classic. Good acting and good quality to it.
2,bellet exercise,This dvd was hard to follow as she did not show the moves that would be done prior to the exercise and it was not always possible to look at the dvd if you were trying to do the exercise. Sound was poor also.
3,"Order the 1 1/2"" belt clip","As an inside the belt holster, this is a speciality item -- not as comfortable as a holster that's worn on your belt and concealed under a jacket. I've concluded that the pistols this holter works with (Sigs, Glocks, etc) really are not designed to be comfortably carried concealed, but are really compact service pistols, not everyday concealed carry weapons.For an everyday carry, I've concluded that a pistol designed specifically for that purpose is best even though there are trade offs. A holster won't turn a large automatic into a small one. For example, my Ruger LCP fits in my back pocket in a pocket holster and is comfortable there all day in any weather, sitting, driving or standing, but has the drawback of being a 6-shot 380 rather than a 13 shot 9mm or 45.Adjusting the holster is a challenge. I recommend that you buy the optional 1 1/2"" belt clip as that will work with more belts than the standard 1 1/4 clip."
4,"Brenda Nixon, author of Parenting Power in the Early Years",If you're teachable and want to learn how to be a more involved parent then this book is for you. It is packed with Dr. Goldberg's research and practical activities to do with your child.
2,Not what i thought it was,"I bought this product because i used to own a ""ultimate codes final fantasy crystal chronicles"" before. However this and the product i was thinking it was were vastly different. This disc only has codes for this game and you can't add new codes. The one i owned before had dozens of games on top of ffcc plus you could add new codes. i gave it because at least disc works fine."
4,NIXON ANTAGONISTES,"Philip Baker Hall is a profusive, passionate, profane -- and perhaps fictional -- Richard Milhous Nixon in Robert Altman's little known 1984 filmed play, SECRET HONOR (Criterion).The tour de force (or should that be ""tour de farce""?) one-man show speculates on a Nixon's fragmented psyche as the disgraced, crazily paranoid President attempts to tape record a defense of his character and makes sense of his collapsing world.Extras include over eighty minutes of archival footage of the real Nixon in his wildly differing moods and modes.The two commentaries are from Robert Altman and coauthor Donald Freed. See this amazing, unforgettable performance from Hall."
5,3 Stars? Whats your problem?,"This film is extraordinary - why would you bother to give it 3 stars? Seriously, what flaw is there? The concept is spectacular and daring, the script is bold and enthusiastic, and the execution unfolds beautifully as we watch a drunk old man wander around his basement. This film connects to the soul of America - it is a voice from our collective dream-state, a remembrance or shadow of our experience. The actor acheives sublimity - the symbololgy is theraputic and transcendent. 20th century America is alive within this project - it is expressed in the very breathe of Nixon...Nixon, Nixon, Nixon, Nixon, Nixon..."
3,"USA Made, But Not Best Quality","These are an ok set, don't get me wrong. However, any torque with the standard type and you will bend the metal tips. I expected more from an American Made company; sorry. I also may be a little more critical, since I use these all the time working on RC mini copters. The key is that I still use them, I suppose, *grin*."
2,General Tools 700 5 Piece Precision Screwdriver Set,As per description this kit has to be USA made not made in china anyway the quality is acceptable and description should be updated because wrong description was the reason for 2 stars.
2,Ok screwdriver,These screw drivers have a good tip but the major downfall is that the handle is very weak I snapped the largest one trying to scrap off some hot glue.
3,tips are too big,"#00 pilips can not fit in the pilips screws on the wii. While with other cheap brand, a #0 will fit just fine."
5,Inspirational Book,"I have read this book probably 3 or 4 times but it is always a great reminder of the things in life that are important. The author does a great job of relating things in a way that make sense with ""real life"" and the busyness we are all caught up in at times. Tremendous lessons to be learned from this book, the reader should plan to revisit it every year."
2,"Maybe it's me, not you.","I got about 3 chapters into this book and lost interest. It's a typical Christian help book that follows similar principles and didn't do it for me. But you know, I'm jaded, it's possible these books can't speak to me anymore."
4,Required reading for husbands,"Stu Weber takes off the gloves and gives it to you straight. If you're a husband and/or father, God's word has some things you need to know. Avoid making the common mistakes and get prepared for the challenges."
5,Excellent! A must for new husbands or fathers.,"Tender Warrior provides excellent insights into God's vision for man. It discusses a mans role as a Christian, a husband, and a father.The stories relaying the authors personal experiences add significantly to the book.This is an easy read from start to finish. It can also be read a section at a time. I would recommend that it be read twice. Once for pure reading enjoyment and a second time to pause and ponder the messages and how they may help to improve your life with God, your spouse, and your children.Locking Arms by Stu Weber is also a fine book. It is a good follow-up to Tender Warrior."
4,Tender Warrior,"""Tender Warrior"" by Stu Weber focuses on a man's need to provide for his family, protect them, having other men as friends, and being tough and yet tender father to his children;Among the topics covered include:1. Relationship between a man and his wife2. Relationship between a man and his children3. Relationships with other men4. The four pillars (roles) of a man: king, warrior, mentor, friend5. Finishing life wellThe around 280 page read contains a smooth-flowing and easy to read narrative and will challenge you to be the man that God wants you to be.Read, enjoy, and be challenged and encouraged.Recommended."
5,must read book,"American males are under assault of many fronts and nearly 50% fail in marriage. This book could answer many problems and prevent many divorces. I have been married to the same woman for 56 years, yet profited much by Stu Weber's wisdom."
5,Worth reading,"It has been several years since I read this book but based on the uneveness of the two preceding reviews, I am going to weigh in with my opinion.I really liked this book. It originally appeared as an extremely long essay in ""The Journal of Asian Martial Arts,"" which as many people know is one of the few academically sound sources for martial arts and martial arts history information. This in itself is a mark of quality.The style is indeed academic and therefore a bit dry for someone who is expecting something more flashy. Sources are carefully cited and footnoted.The work surveys and catalogs martial arts of the Asian world and discusses the spiritual aspects involved in the art and the way each one discusses spiritual growth, if any.If I recall correctly, it does not actually teach any techniques but it does describe them. If this description interests you then the book delivers what it promises. I enjoyed it and am glad I read it."
1,SKIP THIS ONE,"I was really disappointed with this book. Most of it is written in a "" it is known to have been"" style which sounds like guessing. The info is basically a list of styles. The photos are terrible."
5,does not need batteries,"very old school and the daddies in the neighborhood had as much fun as the little guys- warning if the puppy gets it, game over"
3,Not what was ordered,"The toy is fine, however, it is not what was ordered. I ordered the Air Hogs Gamut and received the Air Hogs Blue Sky. I tried to contact the seller and received no response. I would be very careful about purchasing from this seller."
2,Disappointed,"I find the plot of this novel intriguing but am having difficulty understanding Kathy Mallory. The author does not allow the reader into who this person actually is. We hear from other characters about who they think she is, but we never get inside her to know what actually motivates her. Does she have a life? Does she bond with anyone? Does she feel anything? I don't get the sense that she is a real person, which, for me, spoils the otherwise excellent writing and plot."
4,Much better than her last,"But not as good as her first two. Still, a vast improvement over the previous Mallory book - which had very little of Mallory in it. O'Connel sets up a great whodunit in this one, stretching back forty years. The plotting is intricate, and the characters are extremely well done. I would have liked to see more tension, however, and a little more growth in Mallory. And more of those ""Mallory moments"", you know the kind if you've read her before, where gorgeous sociopath takes on polite society and sends it scurrying away in confused fear while you snicker appreciatively, but it was a good read, nonetheless."
2,Psychotic fantasy,"This is the first ""Mallory"" novel I've read, so I come to it with a fresh perspective. I found the novel disappointing after the opening scene. This female detective rages around trampling all vestiges of proper police procedure, and all the male cops (notoriously hard to intimidate in real life) are intimidated by her and constantly yield to/coddle her behavior. I found it completely unbelievable. Mallory wouldn't last a day in a real police department, even if her daddy was a cop. Big-city police departments do not hand out detective positions as a form of psychotherapy for the emotionally troubled.The setting for the story was evocative, though, and I really wanted to enjoy this, but found myself enduring it instead."
5,Good Addition to the Mallory Series,"This ninth book from Carol O'Connell is a tense psychological thriller of the first order. Of course it starts with a body. Obviously the body of a burglar caught in the act and stabbed to death with a pair of scissors by a little old lady, Miss Bitty Smyth. - obviously self defense. But the scissors had been back in the sewing room and the dead burglar in the front room. What was he doing while the lady sent back to get the scissors. Then the report comes back that the burglar was a professional killer. He had been stabbed with the scissors after he had been killed with an ice pick. And the little old lady - what you don't remember the Bitty Smyth case - well, you'll just have to read the book.This is a Kate Malloy novel. Miss Malloy has become well known as a tough, no nonsense New York detective. Fans will not be disappointed to visit her as she works on this case."
1,Strange book,"I read this book and read it again months later. I still can't figure out how the author wants us, the readers, to take this literary endevour. It is to some extent totally illogical and it appears that the author smoked some serious weeds while writing it and totally forgot how to make all the tangled webs she wove come together. Still it has a haunting excitement about it and therefore an acceptable read. Even if you spend the next two days thinking about things like: And why did she include this? or why that? Which turn out to have no connection to what is happening in the story when looked at in hindsight."
5,Excellent Read,"Carol O'Connell never disappoints. She is one of my favorite authors, along with John Sanford, in the murder mystery category. I hope the Mallory series continues after ""Find Me""."
5,"Excellent!! Concise, informative, easy to use, and helpful!",I know for a fact that majors colleges are using this book for Chemistry 142-162. I myself am a High School student taking AP Chemistry. I found the book better to be the one assigned to me by my High School and I often use it when things are not clear. This book is excellent.
4,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING,"THIS IS THE BEST CHEMISTRY BOOK I'VE EVER USED. THE GRAPHICS ARE AMAZING AND THE LAYOUT IS SOMETHING ELSE. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR ALL OF YOU TAKING A COLLEGE-LEVEL GENERAL CHEMISTRY COURSE. THOUGH AT TIMES THE MATERIAL CAN BE A BIT DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW DUE TO ALL THE FLASHY GRAPHICS. BUT OVERALL, THIS IS A VERY GOOD CHEMISTRY BOOK. HATS OFF TO MR. SILBERBERG. YOU DEFINITELY GET AN A FOR THIS BOOK. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK."
1,Worthless,"This book is completely worthless. It only provides the answers to the questions that already have answers in the back of the book. Don't waste your money, there's nothing worthwhile in this book."
2,There is nothing good about this book,"The solutions offered are mediocre at best and are only offered for the problems where the answer is already given in the back of the book. Honestly, do not buy this book unless you want to spend $40 for pure frustration and eventual fire kindling."
5,works great,"now going on about 2 years... original set of batteries still working. this thing is very accurate! must have, absolutely"
4,good book for ALL readers,"(in response to the amazon.com editorial reviews) Sadly, I read the Sweet Valley High series, and have to admit that I am hooked (embarassing I know but I can't help it). However, this book captivated me. I couldn't put it down and am wishing I had my car so I could drive out and by the second volume. Jonah Black is a captivating junior/senior who has problems that any teenager can relate to: psycho parents, obnoxious siblings, true friends, backstabbing friends, etc. Jonah's confusion between real life and fantasy also gripped me; I want to find out more about what happened up in Philadelphia. So to all you SVH readers out there, don't judge this book based on one review, try it for yourself. You will enjoy it."
2,Awful book!,I read this book after looking at all the positive reviews. I was barely halway through feeling what a waste of time this book was. I finished it feeling extremely unsatisfied. There is nothing special about this book. The whole novel is about why Jonah was expelled but you never actually find out. It leaves you with a lot of unanswered questions. I am definitely not going to waste my time reading the other ones.
1,Trash - Smut and no edifying value whatsoever.,"Maybe it's just me but I found this book to be a waste of time. It's blase approach to promiscuous sex, illegal drugs, underage drinking, blackmail, masturbation, masochism, statutory rape, smoking pot, stealing, chewing tobacco, lying and weird sexual fantasies was a total waste of too many trees and other resources. Believe me this does not cover everything that's in the book. Why would this be rated for teenagers? What's so funny about Jonah Black's sister ""doing the football team"" or his mother, the 'sexologist' telling people how to masturbate on her radio show? This might have been a good book if he could have told the story without the weird fantasies with his teachers and friends, and friends girlfriends and whoever else crossed into his field of sight! If he could have skipped the parts of drugs and 'hiding the salami' and girls in underware smoking bongs but then the whole series of 4 books would have been shortened to less than one...."
5,"The black book: diary or a teenage stud, vol. 1",it was soooo good!!!!! so was the second one. i cant wait until the third book comes out
1,dead battery,Camera arrived with a battery that would not hold a charge. I sent it back for a refund. Never got to use it.
1,Wrong price of the book,This book was returned to Amazon with no problem. The price they are charging for this book is $15 each. The true price is $1.50 each. Most companies charge 10 books for $15 which is what I thought I was purchasing.
1,"OUTDATED VERSION, no longer being used at mass","Fellow Catholics: This is an outdated version of the mass that is no longer used as of 2011. Do not buy this book if your children can read, because they will just be confused.I threw my copy away."
1,Not as advertised.,"I expected this book to provide a description of the parts of the mass. However, I received 10 identical tiny booklets, providing no additional information beyond what is in a standard missilette. It does have large, easy to read type and pictures. I would not recommend this to anyone, except perhaps to be used in CCD classes to learn the parts of the mass."
3,"Great movie, mediocre print transfer, no added features","This is one of my all-time favorite movies. Watching this on my 35"" tv from a DVD is perhaps similar to watching it in a theater with a worn print. Although the picture is very sharp it has many scratches on it. Something this good should either have been restored or printed from a new negative. The only added DVD features is the chapter selection. In all fairness, this DVD was probably released before DVD's really caught on and would be better if it were redone today."
5,A Perfect Film,"This is one of the best films I have ever seen. The ending is given away in the first 5 minutes. Most people would think doing so would ruin the film. But the plot is so tight in this movie it only heightens the suspense. This is noir at its very best. I consider this to be Billy Wilder's masterpiece (and that's saying something!). I would definitely choose this over The Apartment, Some Like It Hot, and The Lost Weekend, even though those are all fine films. Sunset Boulevard comes out on blu ray next week and is also a classic. But if you are new to Billy Wilder this is the place to start. The blu ray looks terrific, although you need a region free player to view it since it is locked to region B (Europe)."
5,"""How fast I was going, officer?""","Despite its genre roots and Fred MacMurray's stiffness, DOUBLE INDEMNITY is still one of the greatest films from the 40s as well as an exemplary noir. The film is a sly, incisive indictment of rampant capitalism and the title, an insurance-speak for 'more money', reflects the unchecked lust and the barely stifled depravity of the characters. Babara Stanwyck plays her black widow role with slimy gusto and sex appeal (Wannabe Sharon Stone should take a lesson or two). The anklet helps too. And the sharply written dialogues snap, crackle and stir you up like a giggling high school girl."
4,Universal should not allow such mistakes,"Double Indemnity is undoubtedly one of the most importantfilm noir and finally deserved to be released in thisrespectable edition with an excellent picture quality,especially if you compare it to the previous Image edition.Unfortunately, there is always one But. The synopsis on theback cover seemes to be written by someone who never sawthe movie. It says: ""A calculating wife encourages her wealthyhusband to sign a double indemnity policy proposed bysmitten insurance agent Walter Neff"". The fact is thather husband never knew what he was signing and this isvery important for the whole film scenario. A company likeUniversal should never allow such a mistake ."
2,Universal Legacy disappoints... BIG TIME!!!!!,"Yes.... Double Indemnity is a GREAT movie! However, this does NOT excuse the folks responsbile for the Legacy Series for putting out such a crappy product. Having been so impressed with other restorations in the series, I trusted and bought this edition. Technically, I could see very little improvement over a previously released DVD, and the bonus disc, a VERY bad TV remake, is simple a waste to even bother doing!SHAME!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Double Indemnity,"An insurance agent goes to the house of a policy holder and meets the man's sexy wife. Together they plot the murder of her husband. Film Noir at it's best!! Great performances by Fred MacMurry, Barbara Stanwyck, and Edward G. Robinson as the insurance fraud investigator!"
5,Double Indemnity is a Great Movie!!,"Great Movie!!! Love everything about it! The actors, director...everything!! A must see for all movie buffs who love a good story!!"
2,A classic film but an appallingly bad DVD transfer.,"Double Indemnity is obviously a classic film but this DVD transfer is appalling. Almost every scene is incredibly grainy, the source print is obviously not in very good conditon (perhaps needing to be refurbished), and to top it off, there are no deluxe features and the extra packaging is rather inadequate(with no information booklet or history of the movie).This would be frustrating for any film but is downright shameful treatment of a cinema classic. We can only hope someone will spend the time and money necessary to restore the print for a new theater run, as has been done with other older films. Perhaps then, DVD buyers will get the version of this classic they deserve."
3,"Great film, deplorable DVD","What a tremendous film! It's just wonderful. Especially Edward G. Robinson. Sadly, it's a bit dated (much of the dialogue looks rather campy by today's standards), but the plot hasn't aged a day. It's still a tense and enthralling film noir masterpiece.It's a pity the DVD is so very poor. It's really awful. I can't stress this enough. It's very grainy, there are no bonus features at all, and there's no liner notes at all. Extremely shoddy treatment of such a wonderful film. I'd like to see a special edition of this film produced as soon as possible, and done right!"
5,Great Adaptaion,A great adaptation of James M. Cain's novel of murder and betrayal. Fred MacMurray conspires with Barbara Stanwyck to murder her husband for insurance money on a policy MacMurray wrote. A must see for any flim noir fan.
3,"Classic Movie, Smooth Download","It took me awhile to get the necessary adobe reader that is needed to watch this movie. But once I got it, the movie was a clear smooth download. Movie itself is well played and original classic."
5,Double IIndemnity,This was a good old movie. In the DVD I purchased it also had an updated version that followed the old one almost to a T. Great if you like classic movies
2,"great movie, poor quality dvd",I have loved this movie for a long time so was happy to see it available on dvd. The quality of this dvd is poor! It has a lot of very dark scenes where you can't see the faces of the actors-couldn't lighten it with tv controls. The audio was also very poor.
3,Double Indemnity,"Double Indemnity is my first experience in traditional film noir and i quite enjoyed it. The film stood out to me in a number of ways, mostly the unique story and the look of the film. Double Indemnity's story was unique largely because the protagonist in many ways didn't seem to be a good person. It was one of those movies where its hard to completely identify with any of the characters yet it still remains interesting. I really liked the typical noir look that the movie had. I think the film is a fairly typical example of film noir and im looking forward to seeing more movies like it."
1,Outdated,"This book is too outdated. Read ""Go Snowboard"" for better, up-to-date instructions on how to snowboard."
5,If you play guitar this album does not deserve less than 4,"This album has a great line-up of players, and an amazing acoustic piece. This may not be the best sounding Dimeola album (because of the early eightees mixes), but the guitar playing is probably the best he's ever recorded. This album cannot deserve less than four stars, especially if you're a guitar player."
3,Average early work from Al.,"I'd recommend Elegant Gypsy, Casino, or Splendido Hotel for vintage Al (from his early days at least).Some of the stuff here is good, especially the aptly named Passion, Grace and Fire. Electric Rendezvous, Cruisin', Black Cat Shuffle, and Ritmo De La Noche are all fun jazz-rock songs, but none of them are particularly memorable."
1,oil filter wrench 65-67 mm,useless purchase as it turned out that the tool's actual dimensions do not match the description. Be carefull when you order this specific tool!
1,"Very bad, not worth a try.",This is one tool that you do not need to try. It slipped on the oil filter I tried to remove. It fits pretty tight but then just slips. I had to use a borrowed filter removal tool to get the filter off! I ordered a different lisle filter remover to give a try because it is a lot like the one I borrowed. Don't waste your time on this.
3,Worked on my '09 Corola (with a little effort),Length:: 1:20 MinsMake no mistake. This is a cheap stamped steel unit. But it was available locally when I needed it and it was cheap. Folks complain about its quality... what do they expect for about 5 bucks?
2,Not a pro tool,"Just a heads-up if you are considering buying this filter wrench for late model Toyotas - think again. If you have a cartridge type filter get the better wrench. You can make out four small spot welds in the photo directly in the center. Trust me they are not strong enough if some gorilla tightened the filter housing the last time. The welds break very easily. If you do your own oil changes and have brains enough to lube the gasket and not overtighten the filter go for it. Again, if you are a professional mechanic choose a better quality tool."
1,This is a F oil filter wrench - F must be for FAIL,"The description says that this fits 65/67mm 14 flute filters - so - I bought a new filter, counted the flutes and measured before ordering.The filter measures 66mm across the flats, and has 14 flutes so this should fit easily - it didn't - I grabbed my calipers, this wrench measures 65mm across the flats - there's no way this will fit the 67 mm filter it's advertised as fitting.If I could give it zero stars I would.Update - new filter in hand, I went shopping for a wrench - AutoZone had this wrench, and it did not fit (so that rules out a defective wrench), Advance had several wrenches on display, none of which fit, and when asked, the NAPA counterman woalked over to the display rack, spun it around and picked out one - opened that package and it fit like a glove.Interestingly enough - the NAPA package says on the card - 65/67 mm 14 flute oil filter cap wrench."
1,Didn't fit on 66mm Suzuki motorcycle filter,"I purchased this oil filter removal tool for my Suzuki V-strom motorcycle. My motorcycle uses a 14-flute, 66-mm oil filter. Based on the description, this oil filter tool should fit. It did not. I donated it to Goodwill. It may fit a 65-mm filter, but I wouldn't buy it without testing it first."
2,Try to Avoid if possible,"Got one of these, and its supposed to be 3/8"" drive. But mine was stamped wrong only half the square would clear a 3/8"" drive, as if the manufacturing tooling was worn or something. Tried to tap it in with a hammer, and the four spot welds broke. A cheap part, made in India I believe. I don't think even Chinese made tools are this bad these days."
1,Broken,"Used it for Toyota RAV4, the filter was on pretty tight from the last dealer change? The quality didn't seem that great either."
1,Avoid,"Advertised as 65mm. Tried using it to take off my stuck on oil filter but all it did was slip. Again I tried it on my spare oil filter, pushed it in tight but now it won't come off. This spare oil filter with a stuck wrench cap will be used on the next oil change and dumped where it belongs."
4,Forgetable,I like Russell Crow and I enjoyed the movie at the time. Now its time for me to watch it again because I forgot what it was about.
2,WHERE'S THE MONEY??,"Starts out promisingly, but gradually gets more and more implausible. I was even willing to swallow the school teacher turned Rambo, but how did he get the enormous piles of cash he stole from the druggies to Venezuela? Thru airport security x-rays and baggage searches? Not bloody likely! Maybe he FedEx'd it on ahead!"
3,liked Crowe-movie not so much,"Very slow developing and, at times, very hard to follow because dialogue sound was so low it was not understandable."
3,A Somewhat Satisfying Russell Crowe Movie,"I came into the movie thinking that it was going to be about one thing but it turned out to be slightly different. The previews seem to indicate that this was a movie about a man (Russel Crowe) who breaks his wife out of jail after she committed a horrible crime. Without giving away the details of the movie to all of you potential viewers that is not exactly how it goes down. Yes Crowe helps his wife escape but it is not exactly a jail-break scenario. I thought the movie was ok but not great. There was definitely a fair bit of action that kept me entranced and made the flight go much faster but overall the plot was dull, it was fairly predictable, and in the end you really were not sure if she did or did not do it."
4,"Good fun movie, worth the time",This was a fun entertaining action movie that was worth the time to watch. No it's not a classic and there may be some holes in the plot but it has a few cute tricks and you will be entertained!
2,Great shots of Pittsburgh,This movie was a little slow in parts. Overall it was worth the time spent watching. The shots of Pittsburgh in the fall were beautiful.
2,Sorry but really bad,"I love Russell Crowe but this was bad. The story was ok but the lay out was bad. A lot of nothing happened. The end was bad, after almost crashing they get out of the car to have a little breather. He was just seconds ahead of the cops blocking the bridge, the air port police and the van driver. The cops were terrible, the best part of the movie was Crowe in the drug dealers house, but then ruined. Having the dealer at gun point the man yells my baby and Crowe lets him run off, really stupid. The end seemed to drag on as well. Having really liked Crash I was dissapointed. Also why does he write the times on his arm like he would forget."
4,Good cast,"I bought this for my son, have not seen it yet. He likes Liam Nesson and Russell Crowe so should be good."
3,"Suspenseful, entertaining.","This was an enjoyable movie. It is definitely worth a watch. Maybe a little long, but otherwise a good movie."
2,Movie is great,I am a Russell Crowe fan so anything he is in is going to be great to me. Look at it and see for yourself.
4,Good movie for family,"We are very picky about what we allow our children to watch. No R's. It is sometimes difficult to find PG-13's that are entertaining, do not have fould language, not filled with blood and guts, sexual content and still have a sense of fun, entertaining and exciting. While not perfect, it was an interesting story and fine for children to watch with the family."
3,Not that great,"Not one of Russell Crowe's best films but it's not his fault. The whole plot is pretty lame but it's okay for entertainment. Being a huge Crowe fan I have watched most of his work and he never fails to deliver. Not a bad film, just forgettable."
4,Good movie,Its a good movie to just kickback and watch a semi thriller/actiony movie. Nothing super special but great and suspenseful ending. I recommend watching it. Enjoy!
4,Well Made,This movie started slowly then quickly took some twists and turns before leading you into the thrilling ending. Well made and acted!
4,An Very Good Movie (with an Excellent Cameo),"Solid performances, beautiful camerawork. It just would've been nice if they'd included some more twists and turns in the otherwise good script."
4,Exciting story - top notch cast,Tense plot kept me on edge throughout. Haggis' direction kept the story flowing. Russell Crowe's performance was flawless; the short appearance of Liam Neeson was quite well done - loved the interplay between two top actors.
3,A good mystery,Enjoyed the display of a husbands faith and trust in his wife when all evidence indicate he should not have believed. Watch the ending closely for the surprise.
2,Implausible and Predictable,"Russel Crowe's wife is sentenced to life for a murder she says she didn't commit, so Russell decides to break her out of jail. Appeals are unsuccessful and she declares that she'd rather be dead than spend the rest of her life behind bars. Crowe then seeks help from an ex-convict (Liam Neeson) who had broken out of prison himself, and prepares a plan.After being beaten-up seeking false IDs, sneaking and shooting his way into a drug house and killing a few meth-labbers, learning a ridiculous means of picking locks, creating false laboratory reports to get his wife transferred to a hospital, Crowe (English teacher at a local community college) springs her and we're off on a long chase scene."
1,Not Worth It....,"I found this movie to be nonsensical, totally implausible. The flashbacks to me made no sense. Even the basic plot is absurd - a professor (Russell Crowe?) springing his wife from prison? The Paper Chase meets The Great Escape?"
1,Why?,Three days really; it took years for this guy to spring into action. Please and if your going to make a movie with 30 minutes of action 1) don't wait an hour and a half to get going. 2) Don't call it three days when it took years for all the wifes appeals in court to be exhausted before this thing got moving!
1,THE NEW THREE DAYS = LONG AND BORING,"Not a lot to say about this movie.It was long and SLOW...leaving you with a ""That's it "" feeling at the end !TOO LONG and not enough action or anything, really !"
1,Bad condition,The movie was first class - TOO BAD the dvd was scratched in two areas severely hampering the undisturbed viewing of this movie~
1,Movie Officially Sucks,Thought Russel being a Roman and all that this would be a good movie. Boy was I wrong. This movie OFFICIALLY sucks!
2,I really liked the end of the movie,"You know: The part when it was finally over.At least they got the title right. It seemed to last for three days. :pI give it two stars simply because Elizabeth Banks is a fine looking woman. Otherwise, it was 122 minutes of my life that I could have spent reading.Oh the humanity of it all!!!"
2,boring,this movie was a disappointment for me. Russell Crowe is one of my favorite actors and think this movie was beneath his acting talents. By the end of the movie I didn't care what happened to whom.
4,Unexpected to have enjoyed it this much :),"I was not expecting much at all. I found this to be a really good Film. Acting, Directing and just all around well made. I wish Liam Neeson had been in more but it would not have made sense I guess. Anyhow, definitely lots of twists and turns. Cheers :)"
3,Too manipulative and yet predictable,"Too long, drags at times, editing could have helped it a bunch. Too nice a story, then too many jumps to how he figured out the final escape plan. Close, lots of great actors, yet just misses at every chance it could do better. Okay, not terrible, good, or okay plus."
5,Winemaker,"Great deal, fast service thanks for making this easy for me, I do want some other movies and I'll use your o line store."
4,Suspense success,I've watched it 10 times and finally knew it was time to add it to my DVD library. Russel Crowe is super!
3,Could be about 30 minutes shorter,"I liked the premise of the movie, and I thought the actors did a fine job, it just really dragged in places."
3,"Not the best, Not the worst.","Entertaining movie. Points were a little unrealistic and somehow the emotional drama parts seemed too outlandish and not how a real couple would react, but eh, it was thrilling at points."
4,Offbeat Thriller,Russell Crowe works to free his wife from prison where she is serving a life sentence for murder. The plot has some interesting twists in that you don't know if she's really guilty or was victimized by a miscarriage of justice until the end. Lots of suspense and surprises.
5,Well paced movie,This is a really fascinating movie. The pace and the tension is well tuned and kept you engaged from the start to the end. Really like it.
4,Good movie,"This movie kept my attention. It did start off a little slow, but it improved as the story went on and the ending was just as it should be."
4,Love the movie!,Loved this movie from the beginning to the end. It's amazing that he believes in his wife & his family where he goes as far as risking his life to save those!
3,Disturbing Plot!,"This movie has really good acting and fabulous twists. The issue is within the concept of the movie. For some reason with this movie when compared to others of the same idea; Fugitive, US Marshals, Shawshank Redemption etc.. I felt uneasy with the plot. It can really mess with your mind since he needs to brake himself down to Steal, Kill and use Illegal actions. The other movies have a bad guy that you want to get caught or killed while this dosen't have one. Their is no one to hate only people to worry over. My wife couldn't finish it."
3,"Performances and Concept Were Solid, Pacing Was Off and Dragged","The idea behind this movie was interesting (and a remake of a French film) - a woman (Elizabeth Banks) is wrongly convicted of murder and facing a life sentence, so her desperate husband (Russell Crowe) tries to get her out. Banks, Crowe and the others put in solid performances - and this film really needed that or it would have completely sank, in my opinion. The pacing was off, and it dragged in many scenes. The actual escape attempt is exciting but we don't get there until the last 1/2 hour. I think some of the middle could have been cut, and the escape and aftermath covered in more detail. So overall, a mixed bag for me."
2,A hot mess,"I was so disappointed in this film. Having read the reviews on Netflix and Amazon, I thought I couldn't go wrong with it. It was just a long, drawn out, predictable mess. Most of the time, a box office hit means little to me but now I see why this one bombed. I guess I expected too much. Consider yourself warned."
3,positive depiction of marital/family life,"I had to rent it twice. It was so slow, it didn't hold my attention long enough to see it in one sitting. That said, it was good enough and intellectual enough for me to rent it again to finish. After seeing it, the only lasting impression I had was that it was a fairly clean film that showed a rare depiction of a happy family and a healthy marital relationship. For that alone, I would recommend it."
2,Slow story,"A few flashes of entertainment, mostly dull, good acting. It seemed good from the reviews but the story developed way too slowly. Lots of inconsistencies."
3,Good but not Great,"The Next Three Days eschews the conventional thriller storyline to show a desperate man taking desperate measures. Anti-hero Russell Crowe - now looking podgy for some reason (ala State of Play) - actually looks a little unhinged or deranged in this film while taking on the mission of a lifetime. He's convincing in many ways, but the film might have worked better without a celebrity. Having Russell in the driver's seat detracted from the suspense. Maybe he's too familiar to us. (Interesting that Amazon lists Liam Neeson's films alongside this - both Taken and Unknown are riveting - and Liam makes a cameo here, almost blowing away Russell Crowe IMHO).To the film's credit, we never quite know where it's heading - will he make it? Will they make it? Won't they? So The Next Three Days avoids the pitfalls of cliche in many ways. Definitely watchable. Just didn't press all the buttons for me."
4,Kept me engaged. .,"I am a Russell Crowe fan and I also like Elizabeth Banks a lot, so I figured I couldn't go wrong with this movie and I was right. I was hoping to see more of Liam Neeson in it, but overall this was a good movie -- the beginning has you glued to your seat wondering how the plot is going to unfold and then action portion where Russell Crowe starts putting his plans in motion has you locked it -- really good, I'm glad I purchased it."
4,Underrated thriller,This is a great thriller in the genre of Hitchock et al. It was poorly rated when it came out - perhaps because it opened the same weekend as Harry Potter. But it is well worth the viewing.
1,Boring beyond words,This film is ULTRA boring and the plot is ridiculously implausible. I kept waiting for the action or drama to start but it was boring from start to finish. Skip this rental it is not worth the money.
2,Next Three Days Review,"GREAT movie!! I will purchase another one. When viewing the movie, it did great until towards the end...it skipped and stopped completely.I never got to see the end of the movie. It was great up until that point, full of suspense. Very dissappointed that I didn't get to see the entire movie."
1,What Kind Of A Man Fights For A Woman This Unsupportive?,"If she had been my wife, I would've said, ""Good riddance!"" Seriously, Elizabeth Banks portrays such a deplorable, unfriendly, unsupportive wife it's a wonder why her husband (portrayed by Russell Crowe) feels the need to go to the lengths he goes to in order to rescue her from prison. Had their love been something really spectacular, I could see why he would consider her worthy of such extreme measures. But there's nothing special here, just a great idea wasted on dumb characters. Furthermore the plot develops far too slowly, with little to no action other than the last few minutes. The chemistry between Crowe and Banks is so shallow that you feel nothing for them. And as I said above, Banks is so unloveable that I don't even care if Crowe succeeds in his mission to save her or not. This was just a dumb, dumb movie."
4,SOMETHING TO CROWE ABOUT,"Strong performances, an intelligent script, mature direction, and a study of morality combine to make an outstanding thriller.Under Paul Haggis' assured direction, Russell Crowe leads a great cast. Crowe evokes lots of empathy as the devoted husband/father who goes over the line to free his possibly innocent wife from a life sentence. Is he legally right? Is he morally right? It's a tough question to answer---the crux of Haggis' script. Elizabeth Banks gives strong support as the convicted wife, but it's the smaller roles that put the icing on the cake: Brian Dennehy's stoic father; Jason Beghe as the impassioned cop; Jonathan Tucker and Kevin Corrigan as the doomed meth manufacturers and Olivia Wilde, the pretty mother who befriends Crowe. Add some thrilling action sets and Danny Elfman's elegant score and you have an under-appreciated film--much better than Haggis' Oscar-winning CRASH."
4,Good Movie,"This was a good movie. Don't feel like going into detail, but wanted to chime in. It was good. It's Russell Crowe so...you don't expect anything less than good."
4,Suspenseful & Intriguing,"Not a lot to say; Russel Crowe plays a believable and distressed husband and father that will go to no end to reunite his family. Some action, lots of suspense. Altogether an enjoyable movie."
3,The Next Three Days,"The quality & condition was great, but the movie itself was just ok. I normally enjoy his movies, but this one kind of dragged on with a predictable storyline."
2,don't waste your time,well below Russell Crowe....huge disappointment. Liam Neeson has only a cameo appearance. Looks like they loaded up the names on the cast to sell a ridiculous plot.
2,Too much silly stuff,"Generally I can suspend disbelief if the other qualities of a film are at least good. Certainly the cast in this one is excellent from top to bottom. The pace of the film lags in places but overall is acceptable. But repeatedly I found myself thinking ""ridiculous"" or ""oh come off it"" or ""get real!"" As with so many movies I've seen over the years this was a good cast wasted. Haggis is apparently a good director but he needs help with script writing."
4,nostalgia,"""Crow Lake"" took me back to my childhood spent watching ants, frogs, snakes, crayfish, and tadpoles by the Don River (more like a creek) across the road from where I lived in what was then the northernmost boundary of Toronto.The narration flowed back and forth naturally and easily between today and the telling of the past. I don't need surprise endings, so I wasn't disappointed in the ending of this book - what intrigued me was the development of the main character, from age 7 to 26 (did I get that right?) and the determination of her two older brothers to take care of their younger sisters after the death of their parents.This book is about values, decisions, loyalty and personal growth and all that is presented in an engrossing tale."
2,Slow read,"I have to agree with the other reviewer, this book is boring. Lawson does a wonderful job with details and desribing the characters, however the overall content and plot are dull at best. The anticipation of learning what the main character is struggling with is so anticlimactic and just plain disappointing. I would never recommend this book."
3,Good except for the ending...,"The book was overall good...with a well-established story. I didn't really care for the way the author ended the book. It seemed to be missing more ""closure"". I found it a quick and easy read, quick to get into, and hard to put down."
4,Excellent,"This book was all that hoped it would be. It's a very fast read (one day), but it is well written. I made a connection with all of the characters and even some of the townsfolk. The way the story built I was worried that another member of the family would die and I was delighted to discover that it was only a dream that would be killed. Who's dream exactly?....that it what made the story so great. A true act of kindness does not require a thank you. We all have wants and dreams for our loved ones, but we have to be understand that they often find true happiness on their own, in spite of us. Great story!"
5,Nature Writing appeal!,"If you love nature writing, intertwined with a great story, you'll love Crow Lake. It is not quite as full of details as Prodigal Summer, or Ship Fever, but still wonderful and descriptive. Lawson has a great writing career ahead of her. I can't wait to read more!"
2,your opinion is not always right,This character lives her life thinking that her interpretation of the facts is the absolute truth. She thinks everyone feels the same way she does and reacts accordingly.
1,BORING & S L O W!!,"I like a few other readers was excited to start this book after reading so many great reviews... what were they all thinking?? This book was so boring and the back and forth between then and now was painstakingly slow. The main character was so unlikable, as a child and as an adult. Her fascination with her brother Matt, was not fully explained, and really all the characters could have been written better. The layout of the book I also felt was badly edited. I literally had to force myself to finish it because I figured I'd already spent so much of my time I figured I had to know the end. What a let down.... I found it way to corny and anti-climatic. Seriously, if you're on the fence about this one, keep on searching. Leave this book alone, you'll be doing yourself a favor!"
2,A Boring Read,This book was recommended for me by Amazon and I am glad I took it out from the library instead of buying it. It took me a long time to get through the book and I found that I forced myself to finish reading it. The main character is hard to relate to or even sympathize with. And at the end of the book I feel that nothing has been resolved. I would not recommend this book.
1,Yawn- 1 star is too many,"I started this book with too great an expectation. It was recommended to me here at Amazon and I was going on vacation, so...The obvious metaphors (bug clings tightly to water tension) and the ridiculously brittle main character kept me wondering when this book would get better. If this was written from the point of view of the brother then it may have been interesting. As it was from the POV of a whiny little girl all grown up into a whiny woman it did not grasp my interest.This author needs to skip some details and not others. Suddenly the story moves forward and the only emotion you are allowed is the jealousy of this sister. The schmaltzy, predictable ending left this book to be tossed into the donate to charity pile."
4,A Page-Turner....,"I picked this book up having no idea what it was about and soon found myself immersed in the story trying to figure out what was going to happen next. It does have some slow parts, but I think there is strong character development and it kept me guessing up until the end."
4,compelling,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author was able to draw me in and I just wanted to keep on reading. I liked the setting which was clear but not described to the point of overkill. I thought the characters were compelling and make us look inside ourselves.What a wonderful book - I look forward to the next one.
4,Well done!,"I can't say much more about this wonderful novel that hasn't already been said by the other reviewers. It's a story that not only digs deep into the strengths and frailties of the family psyche, but explores the ramifications of holding expectations for anyone other than ourselves.It was a good, solid read that held my interest straight through."
4,A Pleasant Read,"I really enjoyed this beautifully sad book. Lawson's story revolved around the family theme and she did a wonderful job of eliciting emotion from her reader, and created a real sense of empathy for the characters. A lot of books that receive awards (this one made the Good Morning America reading list) felt like their positive ratings resulted more from hype, but this one really surprised me. I enjoyed it even more than I expected to! Much of the storyline emerged through numerous flashbacks, which worked very well. Coupled with the majority of the book narrated from a child's perspective and the lovely Canadian backdrop, and the book became a fast and very entertaining read. Parts of the plot felt familiar, even a bit predictable, but this did not detract from the joy in reading about this family, and these characters who were the real highlights of the novel. I will definitely be keeping an eye out for Lawson's other books!"
3,Begins well.,"Crow Lake begins with a fine account of 4 siblings, during the year following their parents' deaths in an auto accident. Especially meaningful to two of the siblings is the observation of pond life, as good an evocation as I have read of what nature can mean to the close observer. The rest of the novel is quite readable, but suffers both in its concept and its execution. The seven year old feels betrayed when her older brother marries and turns his back on further education (but not on her); she eventually becomes a loveless college professor, until everything works out in the end. If you haven't read Mary Lawson, begin with ""The Other Side of the Bridge"", as I did."
4,There Is More To This Book Than Meets The Eye,"It might be easy to read this book and judge it on the surface and think it isn't that good, but it is good."
1,Crow Lake,I was going to recommend this book to my book club and I am glad that I did not. I did not find this book to grab my attention.
4,"Beautifully written, but not for everyone","I greatly enjoyed this book. Some wonderful writing about the natural world of Canada and a family dealing with a crisis in believable and touching ways, showing a sort of family responsibility rare today.That said, it's not for everyone. It's much more a character book than a plot book, which means that some may find it slow. Cover reviews said the author managed to steadily amp up the tension, but I thought that was overstating the case a bit. Yes, there was tension -- more of a creeping sense of dread -- but it stayed at a pretty steady level.Quibbles: the ""disaster"" hinted at throughout the book was quite predictable and thus, no shock or surprise. Also, I thought the ending was a bit unbelievable and rushed. But otherwise, a very readable book for those who want something a little meatier to tackle."
2,felt gypped,"I was given this book by a friend whose girlfriend couldn't put it down, even though they were on a romantic trip to Alaska.I opened it hoping it was an amazing book but I couldn't relate to the protagonist. Many times I just wanted to slap her for being so stubborn and closed off.I will admit the book did keep my attention as Lawson drops hints here and there but not quite what the catastrophic event was that divided the siblings. The end was utterly anti-climactic and I felt immensely gypped.The writing is simple and easy to read, but I can't classify this as a worthwhile read."
2,Does not live up to the expectations,"This book is beautifully written but it is nothing more than a forgettable summer read. I kept reading on a fast pace, waiting for the great ""tragedies"" to reveal themselves and in the end it was nothing more than run-of-the-mill family conflicts and regrets. We all have ""tragedies"" like that in our families. It is almost insulting, you keep feeling that the author exaggerates so much, while waiting for the story line to deliver a punch. She should have taken a deeper look at the sad and frequent tragedies that a lot of families deal with before writing such an ambitious book. It was very dissappointing."
2,Waiting for something to happen,"Crow Lake has interesting characters and suspense--that goes almost nowhere. The Pye tragedy is almost entirely offstage and understated. The murder is discovered years later! Kate's huge problem with her family is that brilliant Matt became a farmer. For this she disassociates herself from her family? For this she becomes a microbiologist who can't relate to her students? I read this book in one afternoon. It is slight in several ways. Yes, it's a good first novella."
4,Today Show Book Club!,For once the Today Show Book Club picks out a good book! I had a hard time putting this book down. It's one of those feel-good book. It makes you think.
3,well...,"All the great reviews lead me to read this book,The characters are interested and it is a good read.But it told me a very long time to finish due to I am not addictive to this story at all, I could read and drop the book down anytime. And sometimes it's hard to pick it up again.It would be great if there are more to happen and more conversations would be more interesting."
4,Touching Story,"Having lost parents at a young age, I could relate with the heroine, Kate. Her road of discover was interesting to follow along. I'm glad I picked this book up. It was a quick read; finishable in an afternoon. I felt a lump in my throat many times as I read the descriptions of the family's dirty home and as they suppressed the grief they were feeling."
3,Good But Not Great,"I liked this book but I don't think I would recommend it to anyone. It's a good read if you like stories based in rural farm life, even though it is much more than that. I bought it used so I was sattisfied with my purchase."
2,Where's The Ending?????????,I threw this book across the room when I was finished. Literally. I was interested in the characters. I was interested in the story. It drew me in. That I can admit. But what was the payoff? I'll tell you what it was - NO ENDING! That is my pet peeve.
4,Great story. Well written.,"It has been a few months since I read this one and like many of the people who comment here, I read a lot. This is one book that has stuck with me and has made me think many times about the plot. I fell in love with the characters and then disliked them in the next chapter. The author has a way of making you see many points of view at one time. I found the story to be believable and well written.There is a lot to this book and many sub-plots going on at once. (A great reason to read it again!) I stayed up really late unable to put it down.This book will definitely be a keeper on my bookshelf."
4,"A Quiet, Intimate Novel","I picked this book up because it shared the name of one of my favorite places in Ontario. Little did I know what a marvelous tale I'd just purchased. Mary Lawson weaves a beautiful, heartwarming and sometimes heart-wrenching tale of family ties, of love and disappointment and of acceptance and growth. The characters breathe on the pages, and the description puts the reader right into the scene.What an enjoyable, heartfelt book!"
4,Crow Lake was phenomenal!,"This was a book I read slowly, just to make it last longer. I was so sad when it ended. It was truly a story of family struggle and the guilt that is often associated with such struggle. I bought eight copies of the book for a women's book club and all of us loved it. Even the men we know who have read it would recommend it to their friends. An awesome read!"
1,Faulty - don't buy this,"This is definitely not a well-made product. I bought 2 of these for a work activity and one arrived without the magnet. I requested an exchange but the replacement item also arrived without a magnet. The one stick that did arrive in good condition lost its magnet after just a few hours of use. It was used to pick up small, light coins, so clearly the magnet wasn't glued on well.That said, the Amazon online customer service I received was excellent."
2,Not very good.,"Remember the good old days of J-Horror? When Japan was cranking out horror movie hits like The RIng, The Grudge and Infection. Well, the Sylvian Experiments tries to bring back those days. But, unfortunately, it fails. The pacing is too slow and there aren't really any genuine scares in this latest release from the land of the rising sun."
1,missing parts,I got the remote but not the small connector so that the remote will hook up to my ps3. So with out this part all I have is a useless remote.
1,Bad response rate,"I was really dissapointed with this product, the response time between pushinga button and the machine performing your action has a distinct lag."
5,Works great!,"I did not have either of the problems the other reviewers described (lag & having to point the remote directly at the receiver.) Its always worked exactly as I would expect a remote to.This remote works great as an inexpensive, basic PS3 remote. Highly recommended, especially with how low the price is."
4,"It's okay, but...","It's okay. What can I say? It doesn't have many buttons, not even a power button. I recommend getting the larger remote."
1,So-So Product..horrid packagings,"The remote is small and feels rather flimsy. You can not even use it to turn off and on the machine. Unless you use it just for watching a dvd or movie this remote us useless and a complete wast of money. It came to me in an envelope. No other packaging, no instructions, no protection other then a single layer of bubble wrap that was actually part of the envelope. it barely works. You have to make sure you are in the exact direct line of sight for it to work. Any angle, anything in the way, even a piece of paper, and it doesn't work well. While this is a very needed item, this specific one isn't worth the effort."
1,Big Mistake,"This never worked on my PS3. I changed the batteries just to make sure it was powered and NOTHING! I'm not sure what it was supposed to do, but what ever it was it didn't. Don't waste your money."
5,A Winner!,"Hard to beat this Tetsubin teapot on price, size and quality. I needed this 40 ouncer to brew large quantities of tea for family and friends, and am enjoying the convenience of having ths teapot along with a large cast iron warmer to keep a pot of tea handy at all times during the day."
4,Old Dutch 38oz castiron tea pot,I ordered this for a gift for myself. I love it. I just wish it could be heated on the stove.
4,functional/decorative,Got my money's worth for this teapot; serves very well for two and very decorative!
1,Handle not attached...??,"I had seen the couple of reviewers that got teapots and the handle was detached but thought that since the reviews were months ago, the problem had by now been resolved. Well luck of the draw, mine came detached too and without heavy duty tools to try to bend the iron handle out a bit to get it into the two holes it should be in...and then adjust it back so it stays put...not happening. Sigh... otherwise it's very pretty....but didn't get to use it.Update 4/2/12: Tried a different style by same maker that had good reviews (none mentioning detached handle) and guess what? Detached handle AGAIN...I couldn't believe it happened twice to me...and no one else is having this problem with the other style...??? April Fools joke Amazon???Very disappointed as I really liked both teapots otherwise ....no good without a handle though...not sure if I'll try a third time..."
1,Can't Stand the ERRORS!,"I have read 66% of this book and am so frustrated with the numerous typographical erros I may have to go and buy the paperback just to finish it. I started to bookmark the errors and have found 5 pages of them! The most common error seems to be writing a 1 instead of I, but I found an exclamation mark instead of a letter, and a few words spelled wrong too. The occasional typo can be passed over with a sigh, but this is unacceptable. Amazon has refunded my money at least. So, don't buy this book until they update it unless you don't mind the irritating errors!"
3,Red Scarf Girl: Okay Book,"The main girl in this book was named as Ji- Li Jiang. This girl got teased in school a lot, but her best friend An Yi is always there for her. Her brother is a trouble maker and she tries to look out for him, but he doesn't listen half the time. I do not really agree with her argument, but other people might. This book was okay. It had its good parts and boring parts."
4,A moving story of the Chinese Revolution,"This book shows the best and worst of the human spirit. It lets us see into the darkness we are capable of, as well as the good we can do, weither in a large way or a small way it's there. The truth in this book is stronger than any fiction, the author goes into details that serve to captivate the reader in this dramatic story."
4,Such a easy-understandable fun book,"I have chosen this book just because it seemed easy for me. However, when i started to read it, i just gave myself up to this book. Especially the part where the red guards came and search Ji-Li's house, i couldn't even breath loudly because i felt the same way as Ji Li.I am happy to choose this book instead of other long boring books.This book was easy-understandable and exiting!"
4,"Please, No more massive tradegies like Culture Revolution!","This book is only a typical example among other millions of families suffered after Cummunist took over China..We should all remind us that, in any country, people are more important than the government or the will of a tyrant like Mao. We should all learn from the wrongs and miseries happened in China in the past century.Remember: Never, ever let crazy leaders like Mao, who killed and destroyed millions of people's life in China, take over power again in any of our society. If we let them rule us again, the millions of tradegic stories could repeat to us or our future generations.No matter which country you love, never let this kind of tyrant get in power again. No more massive tradegies like that, please."
5,Red Scarf Girl,This book is very educational although it's a tale of suffering and hardship it is truly a master piece worth reading.
2,Get to the point,"The book never really got to the point, it was very slow but in the end it was pretty good"
5,The best,"This manages to accomplish in few short pages, what many textbooks have been unable to do: give the reader a real view into the cultural revolution in an interesting and gripping way. I read this book in one sitting, expecting to immediatley donate it when done and instead, I'm buying copies for family members. It's that good! This is one book that has a permanent place in my bookcase."
4,Red Scarf girl,Excellent book for young readers. Depicts how government can achieve their goals by Influencing the youthRather than the adults who may be resistant to change
5,Fascinating child's account of the Cultural Revolution,"This is one of my favorite accounts of the Cultural Revolution. I found it totally engrossing. It's often in the juvenile section of libraries though I think it's every bit as interesting for an adult to read, and really helps you imagine what it was like to live during such a tumultuous time. I'm fascinated by China in general and by the Cultural Revolution in particular and this is one of the best books I've read about that time period."
1,Two thumbs down,This is one of the worst books I have ever read. We read it in one of my classes and most of my classmates hated it. Don't waste your money buying it. Don't waste your time reading it.
1,BORING,It took me forever to read this book because it is sooo boring! Normaly it takes me about 3 days to read a book that thick but it took me 2 weeks instead. I would not recomend this book unless you are into the Chinese culture. All my friends but one hates this book as much as I do.
1,Reveiw for young girls,"This book was the worst book I've ever read. It was scary, confusing and just plain beadly written. Some of my friends loved this book, some of them thought it was a peice of trash. I'm with the people that say it's a peice of trash. I felt like I was forced to read this book. I wanted to trough it away forever. The book was badly written because she decided to jump through different time periods and the story just didnt fit together. I would recomend to NOT read this book. if i would have to rate this book with 10 being the best and 1 being the worst, I would rate this a 1 and a half. I tell you, don't pick this book up!"
5,An Excellent Book,If you like Anne Frank and her diary then you will like this book. It is just like Anne Frank instead this girl did not hide and gt in trouble because of her class ratings. I reccomend it to everyone
4,An interesting history lesson not taught in schools,"Ji-Li Jiang presents the story of her early teen years in this memoir. It covers a subject not often discussed in history classes - China's Cultural Revolution. Although there are a few gaps between chapters and a bit of jumpiness within a few chapters, the story is passionately told. Jiang's presentation of the Chinese views of Americans at the time are particularly important for young Americans to realize. This is NOT a whiney, whoa is me, telling of a terrible time in her history. That is what makes it so good."
5,For young people in middle school this is most educating and interesting.,"This is an interesting book for young adults that is found in some middle school classrooms, and that can also be a good book for children as young as fifth grade. Like many books for youth that have a serious message, as this one does, it is suitable for adults as well. This provides a good education for young people and children, to get a first hand perspective on China and the Cultural Revolution. It will help children to understand that not everyone is ""free"" to do as they please, and the cherish their freedom. It is a character-building book of value for young people. It should be one of those must-read book for the summer, one of those books that every classroom grades 5 through 8 should have."
3,good,it was a good book. it tought a good lesson. I liked learning about ji-li-jiang life. They were fighting for a cause that i dont agree with. I dont think she knew what the meaning of what she was fighting for. But she was born into it with her parents teaching her these things. I admire her fight and i would recamend this book to others.
5,This book surprised me. It turned out to be a very good book!!,It showed an amazing story about a brave young girl during the cultural revolutionary China. It had great content as well as being very entertaining.
3,Liked it but didn't last.,"I bought two of these and the one I used worked just for for a few weeks and then one day it just, stopped. I couldn't get the mic working and then the headphones outed on me. The headset I got for my husband the left side never worked. I really did like the design and it was comfortable for me to wear. Don't know if I just had bad luck but I still liked the headset when it worked lol."
4,"I got it free, not bad.","Its fairly comfortable for extended use, and they sound pretty good. One thing that disappoints is base response. Its clean and enough, but not enough when you really want to crank it. Thats when you use real speakers. I recently got a cheap 5.1 which kicks the crap out of these headphones. Still these headphones are usb which is generally easier. Works with both mac and pc. The mic is ok, sound quality is good. I didn't notice any difference between these and normal headphones except the hum from my laptop sound card was gone. Like I said, I have stopped using them and got a 5.1.One thing of note: THEY""RE HUGE!!!Initial setup is annoying. They either need manual setup, or default themselves as mike and default output on windows."
4,Worked better than expected!,"Got this for talking over a webcam for work. Then needed to narrate a few video clips, this set worked great. It cancelled out all surrounding noise so I could concentrate on the audio on the clips and recorded my voice while ignoring other ambient noise. Great buy for the cost."
3,"Sounds good, works with Mac","I've been using this headset on my Mac for music and talking over iChat. The sound quality is alright - not great, and it's heavy on the low end. People I've spoken to over it say the mic sounds good. Having the volume and mute buttons on the cord is really handy: the mute button cuts the mic, and on the Mac, the volume buttons adjust the system volume, so it's not like a volume slider on some headphones. They cover my ears and block out other noise really well, too.My biggest complaint is the comfort. They really start to smoosh my ears after an hour or so. I'm a programmer, so I spend most of my day listening to music while I write code, and that isn't really an option with these. Also, the cord is pretty short. It's fine if you've got a laptop on your desk, but might not be long enough if you have a tower on the floor."
2,"Nice at first, but don't last.","I bought this set to use for my job. I work from home via VOIP and after day-to-day usage, this set started crackling after about 4 months. I currently have two strips of duct tape holding the wires to the mute/volume pod to keep the wires in place to prevent further static crackling until i can get a better pair.The headphones are really good at lowering outside noise, i'll give them that.. perhaps due to the around-the-ear design."
3,Webinar Audio,I originally purchased 5 of these headsets from Amazon to have a 2 way conversation during a webinar at 5 different locations. We wanted to have audio from the computer speakers as well as the headset and be able to communicate with the other sites. We never could get them to produce audio from both. We returned all for a refund. They would probably work great for a live chat.
1,Microsoft should be embarrased,"I bought this thing on October 5, 2007. Since that time, I've only used it about once a week. About a year ago one of the ear muffs broke off. Now, the mic boom has broken off as well. And I am not rough with my equipment. Microsoft should not license their name to manufacturers who will make such low-quality products. I wish I had spent my money on my favorite brand, Logitech, instead."
3,M$ livechat headset,"Basically a decent unit as far as operation & quality. Since it's Micro$oft, windows 7 pics it up with ease & reconfigures apps as needed to use the headset. Major con, at least for me, is the off-on, vol ctrl switch that resides several inches down from the headset on the usb cord. Serious pain in the behind. This thing is bulky and poorly placed on the cord. It gets in the way & places extra weight to the side of the headset the cord is connected to. I finally ended up attaching the thing to the headset with a rubber band. Show stopper!"
2,Much too tight - gave me a headache,"My hat size is 7 3/8. Large, but normally large, yet this headset was so tight, it gave me a headache within minutes of using it.The sound was great, the mic was great, the ear foam was comfortable...it was just way too tight."
2,"great sound, terrible comfort","I can't wear these headphones for more than 30 minutes without becoming severely uncomfortable. The sound is great and the bass is really clear, though."
2,Broke after 8 months.,I got this is in April and everything about it was great until about 5 months in the right speaker broke. I was still able to use it but then 3 months later the left speaker broke too. I guess ill remember to go with logitech next time.
1,Died after a few months,This is the second time ive had this headset break. The first time it broke in a year after the cord kept on disconnecting from moving. The second time it happened after a few months and it just wouldnt be recognized in windows.
3,"Bassy, mids ok, highs lacking","This is a very bassy HP. The bass is pushed up on this set. Mids are where they should be. Highs are recessed and lacking. I currently have a Sony MDR7506 and Sony MDR-V600, so i am comparing this headset to the Sonys."
2,Too tight,I bought two of these for my employees for online conference calls and both have said that they are tight on their heads. One complained of her ears burning when she wears them because they are so tight and stiff. And these are two normal sized women with average (or smaller than average) sized heads. They are also not as portable as some other smaller headsets. Otherwise they seem to work fine.
2,Worked well ... for two months,"This headset originally worked very nicely for me on my Mac laptop: showed up as a USB audio interface without any separate drivers, audio quality was good, fit was comfortable enough to wear for extended conference calls. After about two months, however, the headphones crackled and stopped working. (The microphone still works, but without listenable audio, the utility of the set is pretty much shot.) I'm sadly looking into return options."
5,Great Headset! Very Surprised,"So I first looked at this headset for gaming, as I destroyed my other pair on accident. For the price, this was the best one I really found. I was very, very surprised at the sound clarity, and especially the Bass the headset could put out. Here's my Pro's and consPros:-Very good sound quality-The microphone seems to cancel background noise well-The headset fits well, looks good, and is for the most part, conformable-It pushes out a large frequency of Bass, at least compared to my other headphones in the past.-Very very good deal for the priceCons:-After prolonged use, it tends to hurt my ears a bit if I didn't have it set right-It's a bit awkward to talk into at times, as I can't hear my voice that much, but after applying some feedback, it's fine."
2,Shoddy wiring,"One day, the microphone would start sporadically cutting out. This was due to a wiring problem. Other than that, the mic and speaker quality was pretty good."
4,"Nice headset, but...","Nice hardware, good sound, comfortable headset. The software supplied is compatible with Vista and Windows XP, NOT Windows 7 (kinda strange that a Microsoft product isn't compatible with their latest OS). The hardware will install via plug and play and Windows 7 will find drivers for the headset. You must select the headset as the default device for it to work and select your speakers as default when switching back to them. An inconvenience but not difficult to do."
3,Works well enough I suppose,"The biggest problem with this headset is that it doesn't work with Windows 7 so, if like me you've got a new computer, the only way to make it work is by finding and downloading some other software to overcome the problem that these headphones aren't up to date.They're a bit tight on the head and no obvious way to stop that pressure. I'd suggest they'd be too uncomfortable for extended use. 1 hour was acceptable to me."
4,Very Comfy,The first time I ordered the headset I got a defective pair. I was quite frustrated but the seller was very helpful and the exchange process was very easy. The headset turned out to be great and very comfy.
3,Decent For Price,"I bought this headset for the PS3 since the market for such products is so narrow--big mistake! The volume plays at max when used with the PS3, and you can't adjust it (the volume controls won't work on the PS3). I had such a headache after using it for not thirty minutes. This is a decent headset for the PC though, which is what it's intended for, so I won't count off for it. This is also not a headset for people with glasses. Common sense should have told me that, so I won't count off for that either. However, what I will count off for is how cheap this product is made. Everything about it is cheap, and I can imagine it's highly breakable. You get what you pay for though, right?"
2,Couldn't get it to work on Windows 7,"I wonder if anyone has the same problem. The headset works perfectly with my Windows XP laptop, but not on my Windows 7 laptop. On XP I didn't have to do anything, just plugged into the usb port and the sound worked as expected. On Windows 7, the headset stubbornly refused to pick up the sound. I tried the install CD a few times without success. Then I found a newer version of the driver on the product home page. I threw away the CD and downloaded the newer version of the driver. Bummer. Nothing seems to work at this moment so I'm wondering what I will do with the headset because I bought the headset for the Windows 7 system.If it worked without too much hassle, I would've given a 4 star for the price and the quality. But not being able to get to work on my Windows 7 laptop at this point just really frustrated me. So only 2 stars.Btw, I bought the headset for 24.95 last week and Amazon lowered it to 19.99 today. Doh for me but it's really good price now."
4,Good buy right price.,I am very happy with the purchase of my new headset. A required item for my online school. Easy to use and great for Skyping as well!!
3,Shrinks Games When You Change Volume,"While in a game (happens across all games I play) if I use the volume adjuster on the cord, it shrinks my game to desktop and displays a blue volume bar. This is extremely annoying, since games like Fallout 3 crash when forced to minimize, and in online games like Bad Company 2 you end up out of the game for a while as you shrink the game, adjust volume, then attempt to remaximize the game. The headphones themselves aren't bad or good, but I bought them to use for gaming, and it just isnt reasonable to have to go into each game's audio options -> master volume options any time I want to make minor adjustments to sound."
3,"Annoying volume controller, but gets the job done at low price","The sound and speaker are nice.But the sound controller's big (around 1.5 in by 2 in). It yields unnecessary weight to your head and can easily get stuck to your chair when you lift your head.My headset has worked fine for the last month or so, but I had to be watchful for lifting my head too hard and breaking it (when the volume controller gets stuck).Since it's low-priced, and the volume controller's only an aside, I wouldn't really complain, but don't try to convince yourself the product's perfect."
1,Another solid design ruined by mediocre parts and construction,"When I first tried this headset on it was magical. The design is perfect. The headphones fit snug around your ears canceling out all outside noise - great for gaming. The control is okay (outside of an obnoxiously large mute button that's very easy to accidentally hit) and the mic design is great.The problem with this headset is the same problem I've had with every other sub $100 headset to date: the part quality and construction is god awful. 1 month into owning this headset I started getting static. I opened the control case to find yet another cheap chip with shoddy construction - wires frayed or detached, chip not even attached to anything (the housing crudely glued around it) - just an absolute joke.Do not purchase this headset."
1,Not Even a Month,"I didn't even have the headset for a month and the mic is already starting to break down on me. I mainly use it for recording my voice for online classes, so when I listen to what I recorded its starts at the beginning then it stops, then it stars again somewhere in the middle of what I recorded. At first when I got it it was working perfectly fine an i couldn't be happier with it. I was going to wait a month to write my review but it didn't even last that long. That's how far my $30 went with this product. The bass is awesome though."
3,Great quality but comfort is FAIL,"These headphones are a great quality, good price and built well. However, the comfort zone on these are missing. I can not wear them for any longer than 30 minutes without coming away with a screaming headache. Also, the deep muting of surrounding noise make them rather disconcerting to use for voice chat.Your mileage may vary."
5,so excellent,"I just got this product yesterday and the delivery is so fast, which is even beyond my expectation. Also, this device looks cool and the sound effect is very excellent."
4,Gaming Headset,Just got this headset today from a1 electronics and got it in one day. They have great bass and music sounds awsome so does voice chat! This is my first USB headset and I am very impressed with it.It was direct plug and play with Windows Vista Buisness. Had them out of the box and installed in the matter of minutes.Great for a Microsoft product Highly Recommend!
5,Microsoft LifeChat LX-3000 Headset (JUG-00001),Microsoft LifeChat LX-3000 Headset (JUG-00001) - is one of the excellent products by Microsoft. It proved to be very useful and of very good quality in both the finish and functioning. See at:Microsoft LifeChat LX-3000 Headset (JUG-00001).
1,Didn't work,"I returned item as it did not work on my windows 7. When I plugged it in and installed the software, there was no sound at all"
2,Meh,"Well......they're cheap and they will get the job done. I gave them 2 stars because of this. That said if you have any type of standards when it comes to audio then move on right now. Music and movies or even games and this headset won't cut it. I've had these for 2 days and its terrible. I am here to find and buy another/better set. These will do as some backups for a short time, but again...if you have any audio standards or expectations then move on to another set.They are nice size for your head though and fit ok."
2,Returning these,It was an incredible hassle to set this thing up. Not a simple plug and play experience at all. Wish I had bought something else.
3,"good sound, hurts my ears","These are well made, they are tough! (ear cups do fall off sometimes) but they snap back on easy! block out most sounds, usb makes hook up fast!lots of bass! while gaming they really sound great! and mic is very clear!but after about an hour they really hurt my head (not ears so much) but the side of my head-almost like a vise is mashing my head- and i have a small head! and the top has no cushion so top of head feels pain after awile also- these would be great if not for my aching head-"
2,Awful- Unreliable,Never worked properly. Received without instructional disc. Had to contact Microsoft to help resulting in only temporary fix. Possibly incompatible with Skype? Just ordered another headset from different manufacturer to avoid further frustration from this unreliable product.
2,"Basic Headset With Mic, But Mic Can Be Inadvertently Turned Off ...","For the price, this is a good headset with mic. I mainly use it for Skype.A very annoying problem is that the mic on/off is a button, rather than a switch. This means you can inadvertently turn it off when you bump on the in-line controller while moving around, although it has a red LED to indicate the off state. This happens more often than I like, so be forewarned if you plan to use the mic a lot."
4,Headphones!!,"This item more than met my expectation. For the price of this item, I expected this to be ""generic"" but to my surprise, it has great sound and totally block out noise. You have to turn it almost all the way down to actually hear what's going on around you. My son plays his games on his PC and with his PS3 console. He can not hear me even when I raise my voice to get his attention. The cord is about 6.5 feet long but if you are trying to move around it could be a little bit longer for comfort! When I speak into the headphones, my voice comes out clear to the people I'm speaking with. Great product for the price!"
5,This Is The Best Head Set I Ever Used,when i got this last month i hear perfect i have no problemsno nothing.others told me they can hear me perfectly..even if the tv is on they cant hear the tv..i use it 4 skype and it is wonderfuli would recommend this to everyone im using it for my laptopHp Pavilion DV6
4,Good Product with certain limitations,"This product has following things,1. Good quality audio2. nice micbut i have experienced following cons when using this product,1. Device is not automatically detecting in Windos7 Operating system when plug oftentimes.2. Device has voice echo to what we say.-Thank you"
4,ALife Saver,"This product was a real life-saver for me. I have an ASUS laptop computer with a weird unified audio jack that smart-phone headsets do not interface with properly. I was unable to use Skype from that laptop. The only option was a USB headset. Thanks to the USB connection I am now able to use Skype. There is one issue with installation, though. The hardware will be picked up by Windows 7 automatically. But you have to go into your sound settings and configure the newly installed USB headphone as your default sound system. Documentation form Microsoft would be appreciated in the future. At any rate, once it is set up as the default sound system, the laptop speakers will automatically cut out when the device is plugged in and turn back on when the USB device is unplugged. In summary it is a lifesaver for some people but documentation for the less computer literate amongst us would be nice."
3,Half-Deaf,"It's a nice headset, but after a while the left side became loose and undone. Then, months later it eventually fell out completely. Great for the time you have it, but if you're not careful you will end up half-deaf on the internet."
1,NOT Mac Compatible,"Warning these headphones DO NOT work on MACS! No where in the description on Amazon was this mentioned so I being a Mac user naturally ""assumed"" they would work on my Mac. When I received the headphones I opened the package & plugged them in only to find they DO NOT work! Now I can't return them because I opened the package - very disappointing."
1,DO NOT BUY,This headset stopped working after one month. I only can think of one word to describe this Microsoft product. JUNK!
1,MS wins again via monopoly,"I', dying of spinal cord degeneration due to radiation responses in Hiroshima during Occupation. I've had IBM's, then compatibles since 1981. We had a divergence in programming ever since; MS believes in overgrowth,inelegance, and bugs. We used to work with 16KB and do fine. MS also has other tactics and this was one -- when I woke up paralyzed in the right-hand, it was, what to do? I could not get the competing hardware/software package since it was incompatible with WIN 7 (as are half my devices and programs), so I was stuck with Win7's not very grand speech recognition program and this set of headphones wit mike. The mike does not isolate sounds. It's all or nothing; tower of babel. So I type a finger at a time using my good hand."
1,Refurbished NOT NEW,"Complete Total GARBAGE. Item is Clearly a REFURBISHED unit with only left ear working, No mic, no Right side sound. Used the install disk of crapware which made no difference except more of my time to Remove the junk it added. Came in a crumpled clear plastic bag with all the graphic cards from the Original packaging stuff inside around the original flimsy plastic form that holds the headphones which was also beat up and torn. Likely cost more to return than its worth. This will be my last purchase via Amazon. This kind of thing has happened far to many times now."
2,Broken Headset,"I bought this headset about a month ago, and it broke within 2-3 weeks. I am very mad, it keeps cutting out the sound. Also, in order for it to work you have to disable your main speakers, a real pain."
1,Good design; poor reliability,"I should have listened to all the negative reviews...Design-wise, the headset is great. It has all the features and probably more than your average USB headset.Unfortunatley, after a few months of use, the headset is broken. I can still hear the sound but the microphone does not work anymore."
2,worked great but really uncomfortable for me,"I don't have really large head or anything but found these to be un-wearable for long periods of time, with or without my glasses on. I tried them for a week but sent back for something more comfortable"
3,problematic,"i am a bit disappointed with these headphones. While they do cover my ears and have good sound, they do hurt after a while. Also, i cannot just plug them in and use them. Everytime my phones get unplugged, many of the programs i have running revert back to my on-board sound card. when i plug the headphones back in, i have to close whatever application I am running and restart it to get the headphones to be recognized. Quite a pain."
2,Not a good choice for PS3 users,"I bought this alongside Modern Warfare 2 for my PS3, thinking it would help out with the multiplayer. I usually play games with headphones on since I have a roommate, but as of November 2009, there is no way to get the PS3 to send audio out through a USB connection. Because this is an over-ear headphone, you have to have one ear covered with this, and the other ear open to listen to the TV, or, if you want to use headphones, you have to have this thing hanging around your neck with the mic in front of your mouth while you use another pair of headphones to listen to the game. This device could at least have a second cable or at least an attachment so that it can receive audio through both USB and headphone jack, but as it stands, this device is nearly useless for Playstation gamers.Very disappointed overall."
2,i wouldn't buy,"when working pretty good, but coz of USB connection and lack of help facility something was always wrong. Also if you plan on wearing for more than 5 mins its very tight, gave me a headache"
4,"Great as headphones, good as a mic.","Pros:-Low Price-Good quality-Great sound Quality-Noise CancelingCons:-Very big and can hurt your ears after a while before you get used to them.-Not the best as a gaming headset because it covers both ears and cancel the noise. So it can be annoying when you can't hear your game sound very well.-Also since it covers both ears and noice cancels, it feels weird when you talk because you can't hear yourself well so it causes you to speak louder. I just use them with one ear uncovered."
3,Great value headset just plug and play USB,Microsoft's headset is easy USB plug and play. The sound is above average for music and certianly top of the line for chat applications. I use it mostly for Skype and like the full cover of both ears to take away the noise distractions in the house. Note that this headset operates via a usb port and not the headset/mic ports...
5,headphones,"oh my gawd,.....it's a USB set that just automatically runs first 3 seconds after plugging it in.i have had so many normal plug-in sets that i have had to fight with. many just weren't that good. many just went poof after a short while. i can only say WOW. already impressed. i am so used-to having to go to the sound settings to reconfigure everything and most times just did not work worth a damm. i am so happy with this USB set. i wish i had bought it long ago. and it is the match for my webcam. i highly recommend this set to everyone, if you are looking for something that works, and works well. and a last note, the headphones has it's own sound level, mic on/off, and a light for when you're talking, device attached in-line."
2,Heavy heavy heavy,"I use a headset almost everyday to chat with my friends, and I bought this one after a headset that I had for a year started acting up. The mic is amazing, people comment on the great sound quality. That is really the only plus side about this.The mute button is positioned so that if I happen to touch that area (which happens when I move my laptop, sit up, lean over, etc) the mute button will activate and the listening party will think I am incredibly rude.The headset is very heavy, the pads are very big, and they are comfortable UNLESS I wear glasses, which will just make very painful ears after 30 minutes or so.I would have been content with the headphones and made sure I wore contacts everytime I had to use them, except I bought these Sept 22, 2011, and first week of Dec 2011, they're already broken. The wires inside I guess have crimped and the mic isn't picking up sound anymore. I would not recommend this item."
3,"Worked great, until it didn't","I agree with everyone who has said that the lifechat button is extremely irritating. I had thought I wouldn't accidentally hit the button, but I did because of it's poor placement. And everytime I did, the popup was disturbed what I was doing and made me hate the existence of that button.The sound quality and microphone quality seemed very good.I used these headphones relatively rarely, but after not using them for several months, I went to use them this morning and I got a jarbled sound from the headphones. I checked to be sure it wasn't the USB port by switching ports, still was jarbled. Then I checked that it wasn't the sound card in the computer by switching to the speakers, perfect sound quality. Mystery solved, these headphones don't last, even with little use. :-("
5,Simple and inexpensive,"Item was inexpensive and works great for talking online in Ventrilo and Skype, sounds and microphone are clear, exactly what I was looking for."
4,Good Headset,"This Headset is very good. High Quality sound, Beautiful Microphone quality, but if you drop this thing one too many times, it will start to break, but it will keep on going even after that. The one I'm replacing has exposed wire in 3 places, the microphone is dead, but not the earphones, so if you're looking for phenomenal earphones with a bonus, along with a great price, this is your product."
2,Good headset,"I order these for my wife. She wanted a headset for skype and some online courses.Easy to install, sound is loud and clear, excelent for chat and also it is confortable (at least for 1 or 2 hours sessions).The only drawback goes for the drivers configuration. I order the USB version, so it has a sound card in it, which means I had to change between my computer sound card and the headset sound card every time I change from the headset to the speakers.UPDATED August, 13th)Just to add some comments, its being almost 5 months since I bought it, as mentioned before, my wife is the one who uses it, mainly for online courses.The right earphone just stopped working this weekend. I checked the cable looking for some cut but nothing wrong, just notice that sometimes when pushing mute and another button togheter on the headset make the right side to work.So the piece is already malfunctional and probably will be dead in a few months. I'm decreasing 2 stars because this phone didn't last a year."
4,Excellent headset!!!,"This is the best headset I've had so far! I usually get the least expensive model, this time I spent just a little bit more & got much more value for the extra dinero. Excellent sound in stereo earphones & good to excellent vocal reproduction when using microphone (Skype calls). Absolutely well worth the money! I'd be happy to buy again! And the headset is adjustable & very comfortable and the earphone padding keeps unwanted sounds OUT but do not make my ears sweat. Yes, I'm very satisfied with this product."
1,This headset is extremely bad..do not buy it,I bought this headset 2 weeks back. I am extremely unhappy with it. Firstly it is very bulky to carry around. It is not at all comfortable on ears. My ears hurt even wearing this for 10 mins. Sound quality is just OK. Do no buy this product.
2,Need to return it...,"No one can hear me and there is no way to up the mic gain that I have discovered - you can turn up the earpiece volume - but when talking, Everyone says I am ""too quiet""Short of shoving the mic down my throat - I have found no control of that.I have to figure out how to get the darn thing back, since I tossed out the box and packaging :(Don't buy this dud!!"
1,Microsoft LifeChat LX-3000 Headset,Microsoft LifeChat LX-3000 Headset arrived today - got it out of all that packaging - put the disk in and downloaded all that gobble gook - followed the instructions and no sound from the mike - sound from earphones is garbled - And now I see the price has dropped to $4.48.How do I get this headset to work?
2,Only the right side works on mine!,"I lost my Logitech Clear Chat Pro USB, and needed a replacement. After comparing Amazon reviews on both, I decided to go with this, because it was also cheaper.Here are the problems I'm having:1. The headset arrived with only the right side working. Yes, I could have sent it back, but I needed a headset urgently, so I decided to keep it.2. I need noise cancellation on the mike for my work, but unfortunately, this wasn't as good as the Logitech.3. The headset wasn't as comfortable to wear as the Logitech.4. The mute button on the controls can get pressed accidentally, and the cable is a little too stiff to use conveniently with a laptop.The sound quality is pretty good though - I'm just sad to be hearing only the left tracks :("
2,You get what you pay for,"If you're going to use this headset about once a month, you won't notice anything wrong with it. But if you use it for any type of gaming, you'll notice after about two hours the headset feels tight and your ears start aching. Then you'll notice that with repeated use the sound quality becomes worse and worse, until anytime you try speaking into the mic you are greeted with distortion and static. The cord is really cheap, will continually get wrapped around itself, until it finally ruins the connection and your ability to use the mic at all. Don't buy these. You'll just end up replacing them."
2,"Muffled sound, many incompatibilities and poor leather earpads","Right out of the box I've noticed that my lifechat had a muffled sound (ok ! this is a matter of taste) and I decided to not use it much, prefering to hear my mp3s and games alike with my soundblaster speakers. But a few months ago, the leatherette earpads started to peel off showing great signs of wear and tear in spite of the headset not being used that much. I am greatly disapointed with this headset."
2,Shame about the spoiler,"Very good sound quality and comfort would be just fine, if it weren't for the gizmo that some idiot decided to put in the middle of the cable.That is the only thing that makes this headset unusable in practice. I've owned it for several months now and that damn thing has given me nothing but trouble. Either the mute button gets hit accidentally, or the gizmo gets caught in the chair arm, something on the desk, or it just floats about banging into things and getting in the way.There seems to be no real purpose to it other than to render a nice piece of hardware useless in a real environment. Whatever can have possessed the committee who decided to put it on there, I do not know. Perhaps they should go back to trying marketing camels as the ""new horse""?Regretfully, this headset is not something I can recommend."
2,Comfortable but..............,"I use these for ""Battlefied 2"" and they are comfortable, and the sound is good, but the othr people online ROUTINLY say they can barely hear me. Even with the sound turned all the way up, they still say it's tough to hear me. It's the only game I use these for, so I can't tell if it's just that server or the microphone itself. But I listen to music and stuff and they seem to work well."
3,Doesn't last long,"I'm on my second pair of these now. The wiring on my first pair started to become loose and whenever I moved the wire I would hear static through the headphones. Now my second pair is already developing the same problem and they are only a month old. They work and sound great when you aren't having this problem, though. I would pass on these and get something with more durable wiring."
4,Very nice for the price,"I bought this to replace my Plantronics DSP-500 which died for the second time. I wasn't sure what to expect from such an inexpensive headset, but am pleasantly surprised.While the earpads are a tiny bit uncomfortable for long term wear; overall this is a very nice, inexpensive headset."
5,Headset,Microsoft LifeChat LX-3000 Headset. [great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great]
5,I love them!,I originally bought these for my husband to use at work. When he received headphones from someone else he brought these home to me and they are great! The sound quality is amazing and I love that I can control the volume from them!
2,Cheap and uncomfortable,"I've used these for less than year and am now writing a review because they just broke.Pros: Sound is pretty good.Microphone is very good.Cons: The band across the head is uncomfortable and leaves gouges in my head. I don't have much hair so maybe others with some ""natural"" padding wont have as much of a problem there.Durability: These fell less than 3 feet on to a carpeted floor and one of the earpieces fell out and I no longer have sound in that ear. I'll try to take them apart to see if I can repair them otherwise it's into the trash."
4,Sound quality seems to depend on the computer,"On my gaming desktop the sound is great, clear, the bass is awesome, and the mic is too. On the other hand, when I use it with my old thinkpad the sound is very staticy and unpleasant. But Since I use it mainly for gaming I give it for starts, just really good"
1,BUYER BEWARE!,Mic broke after exactly 40 days of everyday use! Just a few days after my return window!Now I am stuck with money lost and no working headset :(Guess I should have stuck with logitech :[
2,Poor quality!,"These headsets were purchased for a research lab. Within about 6 months, 4 of the 8 headsets broke. For some, the mics stopped working. For others, the earphones. These headsets do not get abused or even used much more often than they would be for personal use. They were cheap, but they still should last longer than a few months."
4,Pretty good for the money,I've been happy with the purchase. My only gripes would be the weird attachment halfway up the cord that gets in the way sometimes and the weird mandatory installation of some MS messenger garbage.
2,Only lasts a couple of months!,"I've been buying and using this headset for the last year or so. My husband and I have gone through about 5 sets so far, and have quit buying them.First and foremost, the big problem we have with this set is that the heavy volume control right in the middle of the wire causes it to short out over a short period of time. There is no clip on it, so you just have to let it swing free or lay it in your lap. With this set, first you hear static, then your mic stops working altogether. Our last order was for 3 of them: 1 for each of us, and a backup. The first one we opened didn't work at all, and was in 3 pieces. So we sent it back for a replacement. The two we used have now gone all but dead within a few months. The backup? Had the same problems as the one we returned. Either that was a horrible batch, or the quality is just down to nothing now.A big thumbs down to this headset nowadays."
5,Worth every penny! perfect for use with Lync & Skype,"I am extremely satisfied with this product. I use it mostly for work and occasionally to listen to music. The product works great with Skype as well as Microsoft Lync. If you need a good product to use for communication/ teleconferencing sessions look no further. This unit is very comfortable, and produces very good audio. The head set is able to muffle out most of the ambient noise allowing you to hear everything without problems ( perfect for office environment). I have not received any complaints with issues in regards to the microphone, as is typical with a lot of similar units. I would definitely recommend this unit. The build quality is great and for the money you cant find anything better, yes it does get slightly uncomfortable after extensive use... but I don't know of any other unit in similar category that isn't."
3,"Decent, but...","I bought this headset mostly for skype, but now I have been beta testing GW2 and I am not as happy with the product anymore.The sound is awesome! I can't complain there. I am usually one of the most audible on skype or in game.The fit leaves room for improvement...so to say. It's fine in the beginning, but after a couple of hours, my ears hurt a bit.My major complaint in the cord. I did not read a lot of reviews and have no idea if it's been discussed, but my cord curls and I have to stretch it out or endure a neck cramp from leaning to the side. I am now wanting a new headset because of this. Another obstacle is the remote mute/sound thingy...I almost always hit it with my arm and mute myself.All in all, decent product if you are not using it often. Long term, I recommend searching for another product."
1,Sounds good but it hurts... badly.,"I've had to wear this headset for meetings at work over the past 6 months. While it sounds fine, the actual headset itself hurts after even a short period of use. I would attribute this to my wider than average head, but my co-workers with much thinner heads feel the same way. I am actually on Amazon at work typing this review because it is so bad that I would not want an employer to make the mistake of purchasing these.Now I'm off to order my own headset to replace this one. Also I broke one of these simply in the act of putting it on my head."
2,Used to be good,"I got my first headset three years ago and it worked so well! Good sound, comfortable, easy to install. I used it to listen to music, use skype, and never had a problem. It survived moving to and from my dorm, falling numerous times off of my desk, and getting tangled. So when it finally died, I decided to get the same brand. Unfortunately, something must have happened in those three years because my second headset just broke after 3 weeks. I was even extra careful with it this time after reading the reviews about delicate wires. I noticed that a lot of the 4 and 5 star reviews are actually from a few years ago. The newer versions seems to be breaking like crazy. I've decided to go with a different brand, hopefully it will be better."
3,MS LC/LX3000 Headset,"Works very well BUT the cord is fragile...it bends easily and gives a ""snap-crackle & pop"" sound; so they DO NOT LAST LONG! :( It would be FANTASTIC if MS addressed this issue because it SUCKS having to re-purchase every 7-9 months; but then MAYBE THAT's THEIR OBJECTIVE!"
4,LX-3000,A fine product for the price. Great for gaming. Used for World of Warcraft chat - works great.
5,Lifechat Lx-3000,"This is just what I was looking for, bigger, more comfortable earpieces at a good price."
4,"Mmm, audio goodness!","This headset sounds great, fits good and is not a pain to wear if you happen to be involved in a 5 hour WoW instance.Only reason I didn't rate it 5 *'s is because it doesn't seem to control the visual volume indicator that appears onscreen anytime the volume is changed. It does change the volume, but the indicator could show 1/100 when the real volume is actually at 100/100."
4,Good stuff here,"This is a comfortable headset with good sound quality. Nothing is extraordinary, but in the same token nothing leaves me begging for something missing.Sound qualityMic qualityComfortDesignall are ""good"""
1,TERRIBLE!,"This is the most uncomfortable headset I've ever worn. Some freaking Chinese assembly worker installed the wiring backwards because it sits awkwardly around my head. If I flip the headset around (right earcup over my left ear and vice-versa), it feels fine.No quality control!!!"
1,Too painful for long periods,"If you have a smaller than average head, I suppose it won't hurt you. But I wasn't so lucky.Prior to a five hour long session providing online support using VOIP, the only complaint I had was that the headset was just a bit snug. Although improving, my left ear is still in pain after five days. Audio quality of both the mike and earphones are fine, but the long term comfort level gets a -3 stars. I would award three stars if the pain abated after a day. Presently, I can't stand to wear them at all but I my job requires it when I'm working remote.I checked my hat size and at 7 1/4 it is a common size. It seems MS did not design these for the average person.From a Hat web site:""The most common male size is 7-' and the average hat size for females is 7-"""
1,Not compatable with web cam,Microsoft Lifechat LX3000 has a USB plug in and will not work with the Microsoft Lifecam VX3000 if your speaker jack on your computer requires the green round plug in. The head phones are ok just to listen to your games. But if you want to use it with a webcam forget it. I have a newer computer with Vista so you would think it would work with the webcam
1,below average product,"Iam so disappointed with the headset,infact i just feel like trashing it.This is because the headset was broken on the left ear and the guy just tapped it together.I feel i should have been specifically informed about the headset condition before ordering."
3,Price is great - Audio is only so so,"The price was excellent, but I found the audio was not very sharp, my hearing is not the best, so being fair this may have something to do with it. But it seemed to me that there was to much base and not enough tremble (high notes) The quality of the head set item its self was excellent."
3,"Good Headset, but a bit too bulky","Great headset, but a little too bulky after a period of use. Would recommend something a little lighter."
2,A flea in your ear,"I don't find the headset comfortable. The earpieces are very heavy and don't quite fit my ears, though my ears are quite normal, they leave a slightly stinging sensation after a very short while.My biggest objection, though, is to the placement of the control pad about 18 inches from the earpiece. You can't change the position of the control pad and in my case this meant that I couldn't safely tuck the USB cord behind my desk because it would have made the controls unreachable. Also, the mute button on the control pad is not recessed and as the badly-designed pad brushes again the desk, the chair etc. it tends to activate the mute button without you noticing it. I'm not going to buy a Microsoft headset again. This headset was cheap and does seem reliable but is not ergonomic and is very badly designed."
3,"Works well, very uncomfortable.","The mic is great, very clear reception on the other end, and the sound is fine, but they aren't comfortable at all. I have to take my earrings out to even stand them for any amount of time. I didn't return them because I've already gone through a few pairs trying to find the right ones and just don't want to keep buying more. Also, you don't have to install the software, even though it says you need to install it before you can use the headset. I just plugged mine in, set them up in Ventrillo, and it was fine."
4,Great Gear,This product does everything I would expect of a headset. The only problem ive found is the padding is a little thin which causes too much presure on the outer ear. This only shows up when you wear them for many hours a day as I do for gamming. Less intense use and you might never notice. All other aspects of this product are top of the line for this price range.
4,USB headset for gameing,I bought this headset for voice chat with mmorpgIt works great but if you have glasses they are notas comfortable as you might like.
2,Sounds and mic are fine but shape is all wrong - Uncomfortable,It sounds good and it it works well but I find it extremely uncomfortable. it is very tight and sits way to low and there is no way to adjust the height. My ears hurt after just a few minutes of use...
2,right side suction only,"the main problem with this vacuum cleaner is that the suction tube attaches to one side of the floor unit giving that side, the rightside, excellent suction power. this suction is not evenly distributedacross the floor unit. the left side has virtually no suction and will not pick up bits paper or dust. the hepa filter system is excellent.we do not recommend this product."
4,Good product but very heavy,This vacuum cleaner is very powerful and cleans up dirt from carpet and wood floor very nicely.. I bought this about 8 months back and till now I didn't really had much problem but this product is kind of heavy.. Feels very tiring after using this.. But I can not deny that the job it does is fantastic. This product would have been best if it was a bit lighter than the current weight..
1,Are you frustrated? Write a book against your own ones...,"Are you frustrated? Write a book against your own ones... Having an affair and being afraid to be exposed?, or being bored, or mad against some leaders? Write a book... Being kick out of ministry? Write a book and justify yourself..."
4,Excellent...,"Works great for light/medium sharpening, not serious material removal. Leaves a very sharp edge. I would rate 5 stars (IMO) if the rods were longer."
2,Spiderman playhut tent,The boys whom I got this for do play with. Them as well a I were disappointed how small it was? In the pic with the kids when you look online makes it look much bigger? It does entertain them because they love spiderman but their 4 and 2yrs old ad still complain how small it is?
2,A real letdown,"Had to force myself to finish this clunker; ordinarily, I wouldn't have bothered, but I thought it would eventually get good; it was Moritz Thomsen, after all, and I'd thought that ""Living Poor,"" his first book, was excellent and that parts of ""The Saddest Pleasure"" were just as good.I guess I just don't have much patience for old men who haven't gotten over their fathers (Pat Conroy's ""My Losing Season"" recently annoyed me to no end), and if I'd been the father of the self-indulgent and humorless young man depicted in this book I too would have been sorely tempted to smack him upside the head a time or two.The book is about the author's involvement in two catastrophes, so you might think at least the war story would be good. But you'd be dead wrong. It's just dull. The whole book is just an old man venting spleen. I prefer to remember Thomsen for ""Living Poor."""
2,Junk,"Low quality. The slide has a substantial amount of ""play"" making precise measurements difficult. The unit I received varied between 3-6mm. The cheap plastic calipers at your local hardware store are more accurate."
4,"Not Bad, Not Great","I read this book, and found it somewhat illuminating, but not as good as, for example, Damon Knight's Creating Short Fiction. I'd rate it a three, except for the end, where the author's discussion of the business of writing struck me as very helpful."
4,"Excellent, Well-Rounded Resource","This book includes not only strategies for generating your own worlds, characters, plots, etc. but has practical advice on grammar, manuscript mechanics and how to approach publishers with the finished product. It also includes a cold splash-in-the-face look at one scenario you might go through on the road to publication.Given that every writing style is a process subjectively arrived at, he still does a great job of making some helpful, objective observations of what good story writing entails. There is the further advantage of being able to track down his fiction to see his approach in action, since he is a published author in the genre."
5,Sets Excellent Guidelines,"This book is much better than some people may think. Crawford Kilian organizes ideas in a very coherent manner that is easy to read and understand. In fact, most of the tips/steps in this book don't necessarily follow the sci-fi or fantasy genre and can be applied to any type of book genre... This includes storyboarding, outlining, and the character resume. If you're writing any kind of fiction, this book has content that can help you and I highly reccommend it."
1,Awful.,"This could have been a good book. However, the author failed to explain his ideas well enough, and thus came off sounding pretentious and dictatorial when he probably meant to sound friendly. However, the reason I ended up pitching this book across the room in disgust is that the author never failed to take an opportunity to slam another author or to play up his own works. In particular, he liked to put down Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels in such a way that made it painfully clear he had never read one. Don't bother buying this book. You can get the same advice elsewhere, without the attacks on other authors and thinly-disguised advertisements for his own books."
2,Basic,"This book is really basic. It doesn't have anything outstanding in it that other books on the subject have. Be original when you write, make up your own world, don't use cliche races and ideas. You just read the book."
1,wannabe country,"One star is for the fact that it has a case that I can use for other CDs... I ordered this based on the other review and am sorely disapointed... this is just more singersongwriter yuck about barfights and lost loves and pickups that has been done 50000 times by others and almost all of it was better.Unless you need to listen to someone imatating a bad genre and purging themselves of all the crap that anyone with a car and a roadmap of the southwest could experience for themselves, go out and buy something that actually contains music and art that come from the soul, not from someone trying to imitate a sound they dig."
4,Art of Armenian Duduc [IMPORT],"Fantastic, the mellow, sad yet beautifull sounds of the Duduc, played by various masters and with an easy to listen selection."
3,padding is 3rd rate,"The color (bone) was fine. When you get up off of it, it looks wrinkled, because it takes a while for the padding to bounce back. Just seems a bit cheap."
4,rotti,purchased this for my frined who loves scary movies. She loves the movie. The movie arrived in excellent condition and I would order again from this seller.
4,A ride of raw adventures!,"Simply amazing and an overwhelming piece of horror cinema! the film brings on a very decent change in your regular horror cinemas. Despite being a gore / monster flick, the film doesn't exactly emphasize on scary looking faces or zombies roaming around, etc. The film maintains a balance between horror and humour. The direction is done very well, the special effects are excellent. The film is entertaining enough to keep your eyes glued to the screen. An interesting flick!"
2,"I ""WISH"" it would have been better!","This movie could have been so great! It was such an original idea, and Wes Craven and Robert England were involved. But, it just wasn't. The effects and the acting, plus the gaping plot holes made me wish I hadn't watched this movie. And it REALLY made me wish my hubby had never bought it."
3,I GUESS IT WAS ALRIGHT,"A WOMAN [TAMMY LAUREN] ACCIDENTALLY FREES AN EVIL GENIE [ANDREW DIVOFF] FROM SOME KINDA JEWEL. GRANTING WISHES THAT BACKFIRE, THE GIRL MUST NOW FIND A WAY TO PUT THE GENIE BACK IN HIS JEWEL. HAS SOME COOL MURDER SEQUENCES, BUT, IT'S JUST NOT AS GOOD AS IT COULD'VE BEEN. FILLED WITH GORE AND OVER-THE-TOP HORROR VIOLENCE. HORROR FANS SHOULD LIKE THIS, BUT, IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO SEE A REALLY GOOD HORROR MOVIE, THIS MIGHT NOT BE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. HAS A REALLY GOOD MOTORHEAD SONG AT THE END CREDITS. FOLLOWED BY THREE DIRECT-TO-VIDEO SEQUELS."
3,Better than most horror movies today.,"This isn't your friendly blue genie from Aladdin, no this is your evil, demonic wish granting monster. After being released from his prison in a gem stone, this hideous djinn must find the person who released him and grant them three wishes, leaving a high body count along the way with people who mess with him.I'll give this movie credit for it's originality. There are several forced scares that don't work, some of the acting and dialogue is atrocious, but I don't expect much from B-horror movies, if only to be entertained. On that note, Wishmaster succeeds.There's plenty of gore and carnage for the average horror fan, a truly evil villan (Andrew Divoff) and an adequate heroine who must stop the creature. It also features cameos by several horror veterans including Kane Hodder, Tony Todd, and Robert Englund. If better horror movies like Halloween or The Exorcist are checked out, then give Wishmaster a try, it's ninety minutes well spent."
5,Good film,"I must admit, this is one of my favorite horror films. Tammy Lauren kind of overacts, but that doesn't ruin the movie. There is plenty of gore to satisfy gorehounds. And for the budget this fim had, the CGI and creature effects were incredible. This is recommended to everyone who is a fan of the genre. GO AND SEE IT. NOW. (10 out of 10!!)"
1,I Wish This Movie Would Go Away...Forever!,"I saw this on cable. It is terribly pedestrian, terribly predictiable, terribly stale. How I wish, how I wish I never wasted 1.5 hours of my life wishing, wishing, wishing and waiting for the movie to actually get good. Wes Craven directed this film. It was supposed to be his latest money-making franchise after ""Scream"". Well, I guess it is a franchise, but not a very successful one. There are probably 200 other horror films I'd recommond before this one because there's nothing intelligent or horrorific about."
2,What was Wes Craven thinking?,"I really want to know. He's a master of this genre, and this movie is horrible. What a load! He's got some great actors, and the movie almost promises to be great, but it's not.It moves really slowly. These people make leaps of logic to further the plot that are totally unrealistic. It's a waste of time and money, really. It could have been cool, but it wasn't.The only cool thing about this movie is that Reggie from Phantasm is in it. Go Reggie!"
3,Harkens back to the monsters of yesteryear,"Wishmaster is a movie that reminds me of the 80's monster movies with monsters like Jason and Freddy. For a supposedly ""low"" budget the movie has good performances (with cameos by Kane Hodder, Robert Englund, and Tony Todd) and good special effects. This movie has about a shock factor of 3 out of 5 and the story is original. This movie is worth seeing!!"
4,Tammy Lauren and Wishmaster,"A genie is rubbed out of an ancient opal and terrorizes poor Alex Amberson with the visions of his killings. WISHMASTER is an excellent low budget horror flick, one of the best. Complete with bloody special affects and a fabulous performance given by TAMMY LAUREN, not to mention, three horror movie villians (Freddy [ROBERT ENGLAND], Jason [KANE HODDER] , the Candyman [TONY TODD]) and the special appearance of Mini-me [VERNE TROYER]What more could you ask for in a movie? ANDREW DIVOFF does a wonderful job as the infamous Djinn and him and TAMMY LAUREN have a classic predator/prey relationship. It is a shame that his appearances on MARTIAL LAW and WALKER TEXAS RANGER, were missed oppurtunities to have him and Miss Lauren on other works together. When purchasing WISHMASTER be prepared for a bumpy ride and intelligent plot twists that keeps you saying, ""What is happening?!"" Fear one thing in all there is, Fear the Djinn."
1,Be careful of what you wish,"This movie was terrible. No acting, the plot is weak and makes me think it's time to Wes Craven give up his job (I'm not being . Honestly, the moral is so ripped of from others movies, in the end of this movie you keep thinking:The moral was more well showed and expressed in the movie NeverEnding Story 2. Doubt it? Goo see it and make yours own conclusions. (not really saying that one was good, no way)"
4,Imaginative,"I liked this film. It was imaginative and surprising. The Wishmaster, who has a cool, evil voice, tempts his subjects with ""wishes"". The wishes, when granted are not what the wisher expected; but true to the last word. The actor who protrayed the master was; masterful, for lack of a better word. after watching 1, I had to watch 2, which is not as good, but the Wishmaster makes 2 worth watching."
3,WES CRAVEN PRESENTS,Ceturies ago an Evil genie was imprisioned in a magic gem.In the present day the evil genie is awakened by a scientist who studies the magic gem evetually the demon escapes the gem and reeks havoc on the city tricking people into making wishes that end up in chaotic and fatal results who become imprisoned in the gem to be tortered stealing dead flesh from the morg gives the demon a human but still evil appearence if the demon grants 3 wishes to the one who has awaken him he will aceive world domination
1,What were they thinking,"Why would Wes Craven attach his name to a trash film like Wishmaster. Thank God he didnt direct it, I would still be his fan but never think of him the same way. There are three flaws of Wishmaster, like why was the lead character always in the same set of clothes, there are three parts of this film where the boom mike is visible to the pole, and last but not least the acting!!!! The plot is like something you dream up at a stop light. If I could give it no stars here I would happily do so."
5,"The best Swedish dictionary available, bar none.","This is an amazingly well written, all-inclusive Swedish/English dictionary for the serious student of Scandinavian and Germanic languages. If you have the time and patience you can use this to master Swedish."
5,Well Worth The Low Price,"I wear reading glasses, but occasionally find documents where the small print is still hard to see. I have been keeping this device by my desk for those situations. I also like the fact that the case is attached to it so that it always has protection when not in use.I just drove to a restaurant only to find that I could not read the menu because I forgot my reading glasses. I am now ordering a second unit to keep in my car in case of emergencies of this sort. I think it will be more portable and useful than keeping a second pair of reading glasses."
1,Bad magnifier,"I bought this magnifier a week ago and it has already fallen apart. Besides, it doesn't magnify very well (which is pretty much the only point with a magnifying glass, isn't it?)"
5,I have needed this a long time,"As my eye sight starts to match my age I cannot recount the number of times I have needed reading glasses for just a moment but not had them with me. Now with this small fold away in your pocket magnifying lens - I always have it with me.Need I say more. Get one, women can put it in their small purse and have the same experience."
2,Non-Sequitor Ending,"I thought the writing was great, the illustrations beautiful, but the ending made no sense given the rest of the story."
1,Absolute tripe,"This album typifies everything that is wrong with modern bands.How often must we hear ""a bludgeoning mix of extreme metal, grind, and hardcore""? The description itself is bound to attract a plethora of listeners who want others to think they are ""cool"" because they are hip to the modern ""metal"" jive.But on to the music:There's really nothing that stands out on this album. All of the riffs are basically ripped from watever popular band is playing whatever style they are trying to imitate. Example: When they play death metal riffs, it reeks of Suffocation; when they play ""hardcore"" riffs, it sounds like something a lazy ripoff of the Warriors would play; and when they play tech/grind riffs, well... they rip off Ion Dissonance. Starting to see the picture? It's not a 8r00tal mix of grind, hardcore, and extreme metal; it's just a cut-and-paste carbon copy of every band Despised Icon wishes they could be.LAME"
5,Great crossover/deathcore cd,"this has everything you want. 2 vocalists, crazy riffs, insane breakdowns, intense blast beats, and much much more. all the songs are great. if you like all shall perish, premonitions of war, or animosty get this. these guys are going to blow up and become your new favorite band"
1,"15 minutes of next to ""nothing"".",You will get more complete and useful information on the internet than on this video. Pretty much a waste of time and money...which could be spent on several good books.
5,the best sports psych book,"There are a lot of good books on mental training for athletes but I think Terry Orlick's stands out by carrying information that is insightful, well-rounded, very practical, beneficial to reducing anxiety, increasing focus on the task and, ultimately, performance.As an Olympic medal winner who now manages a online sport psych shop (sportsmindskills.com) I've come across a lot of books on the subject and this is the winner!"
4,A must read,"Especially if you are in competitive sports, both as a competitor or coach. Offers great tips on mastering the mental aspect of your goals."
1,waste of money,"This book tells us we have to do this and we have to do that but there are no methods to do either. It just says concentrate, focus etc. There are no techniques to do any of the things that we're supposed to do to achieve excellence. I stopped reading about 2/3 of the way through. Turned into a massive waste of time. i could write the whole book on one page! Want a mental training book? Try Bassham."
1,Do not buy this book!,"This book deserves a negative rating as it is horribly inaccurate in pretty much everything it has in it. I like the idea of this activity book a lot, but was already very skeptical after reading just the title. The ""friend or foe?"" part really bothered me from the start and it got worse once I opened it.I have read several books in this series and all of them have horrific historical errors to the point my head hurt. I do not know where the author got her information, but it is completely wrong in nearly every way. If you want a great book for your children that has the facts this is not it. And from the 5 or so books in this series I have read none have anywhere near enough factual information to warrant a parent or teacher buying this for their children, unless they are not interested in them learning the real history.Stay away from this book and books in this series if you want the real history!"
3,Not like the picture,"The picture shows the coach holding 2 straps approximately 10ft+ each connected to the player.What you get in the package is something different. 1 strap is about 3 ft long, the 2nd strap is around 6-8ft in length.I am assuming the 3ft strap is for the runner to pull the quick release themselves."
5,An America that you never knew about!,"This is a really good read. Martin Fletcher is an Englishman who travelled the back roads of the USA. This book is about his findings. For the most part, Fletcher had specific destinations in mind, but the things and people that he introduces us to are remarkable. Some of the things that he writes about that amazed me are: a group of Americans whose speech patterns still smack of Elizabethan English, an island that is home to a herd of wild horses that are the descendants of a Spanish shipwreck from hundreds of years ago, the Mysterious Melungeons, and just about every other sub-culture group in the US. This is a very informative and interesting read. I couldnt put it down."
5,Deserves the same applause as Bill Bryson,"I love travel writing, of which this book is a great example. However, I only stumbled upon it because I happened to meet a friend of the author, and I think its a great shame that more people haven't been introduced to this writer. This book covers his journey from The Delmarva peninsula all the way to the Pacific NW. Along the way he took the time to meet with locals, and learn about their everyday lives and the changes that have been ongoing in many of the little nooks and crannies of this country. He had researched his trip well, and took the time to meet with local politicians and newspaper editors, all of whom added their own local flavor. I have been eagerly awaiting Bill Brysons next book and now I will add Martin Fletcher to the same waiting list."
4,Delightful Romance Moves At Its Own Pace,"This film is a delightful and naturalistic look at two young men slowly and clumsily realizing that they are attracted to each other and have the beginnings of deep feelings for each other. The acting by the two leads is spot-on just right and the screenplay and direction are also very effective. This is a film with fascinating visuals and background. I learned allot about working on a farm - and it was interesting to me. There is an almost documentary style at work here in which the budding male-male romance fits in comfortably. American audiences expecting "" action "" and contrived plot or those from anywhere looking for sex and nudity are going to be disappointed. Everyone else should sit back and enjoy."
4,Excelente German Culture Story - Cultura Alemana del Amor,"Me parece excelente la película, al mostrar como la frialdad de la cultura alemana alberga oportunidades para mostrar amor entre dos hombres, y como a pesar de esa frialdad los sentimientos son sólidos y constantes. Muy europea y tierna bien que mal.Excellent to show the german culture of love between men, cold, but solid... slow but taking chances. I hardly recommended."
2,"[subtle. very, very subtle].","Take a promising premise then imbue same with a totally unsubtle amount of open-ended subtleness and VOILA! ""Harvest!""Two good actors wasted their time - and ours - on a very subtle, disappointing and somewhat improvised script that left way too many unanswered questions. Randomly juxtapose that against what amounts to a lengthy and much less subtle documentary on German agricultural practices and the result teaches one a lot more about raising cows than it does about what the DVD's blurb called ""sweet gay romance.""Well intentioned but, in the end, ""Harvest"" offers the gay cinema fan almost nothing in return for their investment of money and time."
1,"Too short and really, no story.","This movie was typical. A repressed guy having feelings for another repressed (sexually and emotionally) guy and they have to keep it secret. I'm sick of these movies because it's been done to death. I had hoped for more depth with the characters based on the previews. They hook up, like it and the movie ends. A little bit was touched about their lives but it was like the writer and director were too lazy to go into detail and you're expected to fill in the blanks for the whole movie. No romance, it was like Brokeback but with no details about the characters lives and no hardships filmed on what they had to go through for them to keep their ""love"" secret. The actors were good! Imagine that! But the story sucked and should've been better spun out."
2,Boring,"This could have been so much better.You never get to know the characters, so it is hard to care. Too bad... the premise was promising."
1,"Slow, sucky movie","What a waste of my money, and what a waste of my time to watch it !!! Too bad--for me--there wasn't a preview b4 I ordered !"
2,Boring..,A very boring film. The film almost feels like you are watching a documentary style film. The characters do not tell enough of a back story to draw the viewer into the film itself. Don't waste your money on this one. There is not much of a love story at all...it's just 2 aimless guys going to farming school and there is barely any interaction between any of the characters at all. I was hoping one was going to hang himself just to add drama to the show.
2,Boring boring boring,I am a big fan of movies and always excited to watch any new GLBT movies. I watched this movie with friends and it just kept going on and on and never went anywhere. I began to get bored after a while and then when action finally began I was like where did that come from and the ending was not any better. Don't waste your time or money on this.
5,The BEST post-hardcore album ever,"I can honestly say i do not think there is a better post-hardcore album available. Almost every track is great, and the balance of the two vocalists is perfect. You WILL NOT find a better album. (except maybe a greatest hits, but those don't count)"
3,what is alexisonfire doing?,"this is a pretty good cd, not too bad, not too great either, just like their last release, ""Watch Out."" However, their first self titled release was amazing, one of my top ten albums ever, and comparitively, watch out and crisis are horrible. I don't want the band to re-make the same album again or anything too similar, like any band i'd like to see them progress and grow. But this isn't progression, this band is moving backwards into a generic punky type sound one might hear endlessly at the warped tour. They switched sounds when they made watch out and now they firmly planted themselves in medicore music; not a terrible release but alexisonfire should get their act together."
1,More mainstream than Maroon 5,"Formula for an alexisonfire song1. Melodic, testosterone free intro, into ""crushing verse""2. Worst screamer in the world goes on for a few measures3. Sing chorus, preferably with high pitched squeal vocals4. Repeat5. OutroPathetic."
5,This book saved me a lot of money and time,"This book was one of my best woodworking purchases. I had recently purchased a router and was seriously considering buying a commercial router table. Fortunately, I purchased this book first. I made both a mini-table and a larger table described in this book at a fraction of the cost of the commercial router table I was looking at. I'm also learned a lot of router techniques that have helped me enjoy my router a lot more. This book is well-written and the many pictures make this a great reference and an easy, enjoyable read."
2,Too old,"In general the book is well written with lots of illustions. My complaint is the age of the technology, old B&W pictures. I would have liked to have seen more modern routers. There is only brief mentions of plunge routers."
5,Well written comprehensive reference,"I have been dabbling in woodworking for years, but have always avoided router work for one reason or another. I purchased this text in the hope that I could self-teach myself enough to start adding router work to my projects.This book contains exactly the kind of information that I had been looking for. It explains all the basics about designing and constructing your own router table/cabinet, use and construction of jigs, types and uses of bits, frame and panel construction, and dovetail joints, among many others.At roughly 350 pages, it is built more like a college textbook. There is more than enough information to put you well on your way into several projects.Highly recommended for the beginner and intermediate level woodworker."
4,great information for all wood workers!,"this is an excellent book for beginners or experts alike. the hands on approach, diagrams, and charts are very clear and consise. for the beginer, there are several bit suggestions to keep in mind while building your set of router bits"
5,Somehow only 5 stars doesn't seem adequate,"Very, very, very good book, especially for those who want to make their own tables, jigs, and accessories."
3,router,"Price, condition, and delivery were fine. The book is useful, but it's a bit out-of-date. That's my own fault, trying to save money by buying an older edition."
4,Cool projects,"Must have for anyone with a router. Really good projects, and gives you the confidence to tackle projects you wouldn't have tried! Everything comes out so professional looking."
5,Woodworking with the Router,The book is excellent for someone new to woodworking with a router or to the advanced hobbiest. Well illustrated throughout with easily followed text.The book was as advertised as to condition and shipping time. Very satisfied with the item and service.
3,good but,"Woodwork with router has very useful tips, and you gain the tricks that can only be learned with long years of experience, what I found really lousy is the lack of more illustrations, and the very poor quality of pictures. If you have never worked with a router before, like me you will find it extremely difficult to imagine everything the author talks about. 5 stars for the text, 1 star for the pictures, I will give it 3 stars."
4,Good comprehensive book,"This is a great book on routers. It is a great soup to nuts book that covers usage, safety, bits, and jigs. For someone new to routers, this is an oustanding reference.The reason I gave it four stars is because it is all in B&W.; I am a B&W; photographer (www.obrienphoto.com) but that doesn't mean that all things are suited for this medium. The photos are not half as good as they could be.But not to fear -- in March of 2006 they are releasing a revised version of this book. I would hold of and get this one instead.Michael"
5,The Ideal Reference for Novice Router Users.,"My current knowledge of routers and routing techniques is very limited, but my confidence and enthusiasm has now been positively extended since I purchased this book. I have spent most of my working life in general engineering as a Fitter/machinist, so my woodworking experience is limited.I found this book easy to read,understand and very hard to put away.Thank you Amazon.com for your fast eficient service, I live way down at the bottom end of South Australia, but the book arrived within 10 days, well done!"
4,Woodworking With the Router: Professional Router Techniques and Jigs Any Woodworker Can Use,This is one fabulous book for either the beginner or the experienced woodworker. The tips and jigs and facts are worth many times its price. I will eventually hand it down to my son.
3,photos need updating,"I know the techniques haven't changed much, but at least get rid of the black and white photos :-PDecent book describing useful techniques and jigs."
1,Woodwork with Router by Bill Hylton,"This is a very comprehensive, easy to understand manual on how to get the most from a router. I recommend it to anyone wanting hints on extending the applications possible from their router."
4,Dice Angel - a good throw of the dice,"Things I learned this weekend...don't start a Brian Rouff book if you have a History exam that you are suppose to be studying for. I picked up Dice Angel, read the first two chapters and kept on reading during any spare time I found. The book was fun, with some plot twists that were unexpected. The characters, as pedestrian as the phrase may be, came alive from the pages. Living in southern Nevada, I related to many of the little Las Vegas quirks Brian included in his book, i.e., traffic cones, red lights and implosion prone redevelopment; I also learned other things that only someone who had done his research could have learned. The book is a fast read, it is fun, and gives a lesson each one of us should adopt: that if we don't believe in ourselves, we can only hope there is an angel out there who will."
5,"Fast-paced, fun and funky Sin City tale","DICE ANGEL is a thoroughly modern fable about an often inscrutable place. Las Vegas serves not just as a backdrop, but as a character, in this tale of IRS agents who play hardball, relatives who aren't who they say they are, and ex-wives exacting retribution. From cross-town traffic to cross-wise cops, author Brian Rouff colors a fast-paced story on an immovable deadline with insider Vegas facts. Will the unlikely heroine save the day . . . and the bar? After all, ""baby needs a new pair of shoes."" A great read for a Vegas-bound visitors."
4,Fun summer read,"""Dice Angel"" by Brian Rouff is a fun, easy read with well-defined characters, a lively plot and a surprise ending. Set in the other world of Las Vegas, the one locals know and love, Rouff captures the benefits and dilemmas of life a few blocks off ""The Strip."" What more could you want for an escape to the ""Entertainment Capital of the World?"""
3,Dice Angel,"Jimmy Delaney is the owner of local Las Vegas landmark pizzeria/bar, Jimmy D's; which he inherited from his father.Jimmy's life is cruising along nicely. He loves being the owner of Jimmy D's. He loves his daughter Jenny and has a great relationship with her even though he is a part-time dad. He even gets a kick out of phone sparring with his ex-wife.Everything changes when Jimmy's ex-brother-in-law, who is also his accountant, suddenly disappears; along with all of his cash. Not only is his money gone, Jimmy finds out he is in hock to the IRS for over $$$ because his brother-in-law never sent in his tax payments. It seems there is no way out.One of Jimmy's 'regulars', a homeless man gives him an old business card with the name Dice Angel on it. As a last resort, Jimmy calls the number.Dice Angel is a quick enjoyable read with a likable main character, some comedy, some snappy dialogue (although there is some overuse of comparison humor), a dash of fantasy, and a tidy ending."
5,A New Series (we hope!) from Glitter City,"And along comes Jim Delaney,tough/tender, funny and totally believable character we demand to hear more about. Instantly into the Las Vegas scene, brilliantly portrayed in all its gritty, quirkiness, you're absolutely glued to this book until the last page. Whether you are a Vegas regular, or have never visited, by the time you reach Chapter 2, you will already have a feel for the city. Mr. Rouff, please keep Jim Delaney on the scene - in just one book, he's become a wonderful fictional friend of ours. He's bound to have more adventures - he is definitely the type."
5,America's Soundtrack,"So many memories with the listening to of these songs. Hard to name a favorite, but standouts for me have always been (Scarborough Fair, April Come She Will, El Condor Pasa(If I Could), Bookends Theme, The Sounds Of Silence, At The Zoo, The Boxer) to name but a small few. All five original albums, from 1964 to 1970 in one. A real musical bargain."
5,Just about everything you could want,"They've got it all here, the only thing missing is the top ten single they recorded five years after the breakup (""My Little Town"")."
4,simon & garfunkel collected worksw,very good value even though i had most of the cds. i liked it. bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
3,inferior sound quality,"Simon And Garfunkel are one of my favorite musical duos, and this 3-CD set features each of their five original albums. The first four albums are on the first two CDs, while the last album is on a disc own its own. The booklet includes the lyrics to the songs, which is cool. The albums all have tracks on them that I don't care so much for, but I do like the set. However, the sound quality isn't the greatest. The tracks sound rather like they were copied off of cassettes. These are ""earlier"" CDs, and I doubt that the tracks were taken from original masters. I'll probably eventually be getting the Columbia Studio Recordings set, which is much more recent and which uses original masters (I think) and features bonus material. Don't get this set unless you just want all of S&G's original albums in a smaller package than the CSR set and don't really care about great sound quality or bonus material."
3,full of synthetics,"While the idea of this book is great, and several of the recipes are great with a little bit of tweaking, its full of synthetic oils. Ritual incense has no room for fragrance oils that are loaded with chemicals. There is good information in this book regarding consecration and planetary aspects when making incense and oils. The information presented is probably only useful for someone just starting out making their own blends but again, I caution on the use of synthetics such as lotus, mandrake and amber oils."
4,From the Heart of Dixie,"Flatt & Scruggs were a great duo. Lester Flatt was a terrific singer and guitarist. Earl Scruggs was possibly the best banjo player in the business. Together they made some wonderful records. There are ten of them right here on this CD. Which brings me to the only problem I have with this CD. There are only ten songs here! It's only 25 minutes long! All the material here is really good, but you would be better off buying a longer CD."
2,What a rip-off!,"This is a nice story, let me say that. However, it is only 19 pages long, and those pages have a very small amount of text on them. But the description says that this book is 108 pages! And it is - but most of those pages are blank! It's totally weird! You read for just a few minutes, get to page 19, the story ends, and then there are more than 80 blank pages after that. I cannot believe that this costs $15. And it's especially ironic since it's a waste of paper in a book that talks about not letting trees go to waste."
3,A flawed masterpiece.,"Some of Third Worlds finest work appears here. Rock the World, Spiritual Reolution and Who Gave You (Jah Rastafari) are beautiful tracks. But the disco influenced tracks are mostly unimaginative."
5,Another great work by Eric Avery from Jane's Addiction,"This is a great companion to the band Deconstruction that Eric Avery and Dave Navarro formed at the demise of Jane's Addiction. Although Dave Navarro's solo album is better than Perry Farrell's, Eric Avery proves that he was really the mastermind behind Jane's Addiction. I just wish that he'd get back together with Dave Navarro and release another Deconstruction album and tour with it. Oh well."
1,Noisy cheap fan,"I installed this fan in the basement full-bath; the installation was not that hard, but the noisy level is almost intolerable. The construction of the fan is extremely flimsy -- no screws securing the fan unit with the housing. The noise aside, the fan does not seem to have the advertised ventilation power."
4,Pretty straight forward installation,"I bought this to replace a fan existing fan. I thought this was a replacement for the one I had, but turned out it was almost the same. I was hoping to take down old fan and just swap the insides. Didn't work for me. Had to take oput the original and replace it with all of this fan. Overall after a smashed thumb and cracked drywall ceiling it was in and working great. I don't see it as really loud since it is quieter than the one I replaced and seems to work better than the old one. So far it is holding up and working good."
1,"Incorrect description it is 9 by 9.25""","I just took the product out the box - and it does not have a 9.5"" by 10.5"" grille - it is 9 by 9.25 - to small for the hole in my ceiling. I am disappointed in Amazon as on the box it says this - this is just false advertising."
4,More about character,"Personally, I feel the title of the book is deceiving. Yes, there are a lot of names that He says ""I am..."" (ie. Alpha & Omega, etc) that are listed in this book, but in my opinion, a LOT of ""names"" they list here are describing His character. By reading the verses they provide, most of them describe what He does for us. (You would'nt give me a name like, ""homemaker"" because that's what I do, would you?). Anyway, I am enjoying the book, but keep thinking, ""this is not a NAME, it's a character trait"", so for me it is distracting in my mind. A bigger complaint I have is the fancy font they use for the Hebrew name. Very hard to read sometimes (almost impossible w/o wearing glasses). They should've just used a simple font. I do enjoy the personal application comments at the end of each ""name""."
2,Doesn't Measure Up,"I guess I only have myself to blame for buying this, although the photo really is misleading, giving an illusion of thickness and substance. A couple of details are also missing in the photo(airbrushed/Photoshopped out?) The gauge of metal (i.e., thickness) would have to be two to three times what it is to make a decent tool of this type.Fact is that this is a flimsy piece of stamped metal which I am ashamed to say I paid $8.99 for. I would say $2.00 might be the right price, if in fact you wanted it at all. Probably would have been better to buy the plastic version, since they couldn't have made the plastic this thin without it wilting in your hand. I'll bet you could make a high-quality cardboard model that would be superior.Also, there is no reference marking for the ""IN"" millimeter measurement, and the first mm. and 32nd seem truncated about 50%.Caveat emptor, folks, semper caveat emptor."
1,I threw it aside in disgust,"A poxy book - between the front and back covers is a lot of air in which the word ""virtual"" is said 3 times in every sentence. Take the word out and you have one of those ghastly management texts written from a belief system without any real practical backup. The tenets are unbelievably ignorant in some cases. Anyone who can say that executives who express preference for face-to-face communication are being defensive doesn't know a thing about socialisation or tacit knowledge processes. They must think the world can be ordered around aka the military model. oh whoops, one of the authors spent 35 years as a career officer in the USAF. So if you are into military-type operations where commands can be relayed over sophisticated networks, this book is for you. If you are interested in the boundaryless organisation and the meaning for social behaviour, steer clear."
1,I'd pass on this one,"I was extremely disappointed with this CD. It was not the high quality performance that I have enjoyed with other Los Lonely Boys' recordings. In addition, the cuts weren't anything new or different - it was basically the same stuff - just with a different title."
1,Zipper problem,"I bought this a few years ago and wore it very often and it didn't wear out for at least a year and being exposed to the sun often. However I bought it again a few days ago and the zipper keeps coming down, and I was reminded that I had the same problem with the first one, same design apparently. Another problem is that this really thin thing ATTRACTS cold, it doesn't keep it out."
1,Poor quality and performance,"I bought this ratchet screw driver to replace a similar one that I had lost. I thought this looked like a direct replacement, but its quality was very poor.The two flat pieces that make up the handle are not tightly fastened together. The combination Phillips and slot screw bit is not removeable or reversible, as had been in my older one--the Phillips end is longer and the regular slot end so short it is almost useless.In performance, the ratchet switch was hard to set into either position, forward or reverse; during use, it keept slipping to the other setting; and it is positioned right where your thumb naturally falls during use so no matter where you set it, it is constantly being disengaged or reversed.Don't waste your money on this one. I threw it away.A much better and cheaper choice with a variety of bits ishttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XYOUS6/ref=oss_product"
1,"Lofty, puzzling, slow","This book did not work for me. I know that many people regard Ramana as one of greats in non duality awakening. Why doesn't it work for me? First, the question and answer format strikes me as stilted. I often don't find myself having the same questions as the interlocutor. Then, I want something very practical; I want to be walked through the inquiry process and methods that can help lead to awakening, not to know the semantic meanings and definitions of the words (""knowledge, pure mind, bliss""), and the meanings of the words might even be special to or specialized by the author, not the ordinary plain definition, and often the key terms are not strictly in English. My frustration is not due to unfamiliarity with the basic ideas. I have listened to dozens upon dozens of authors who had awakenings describe their experiences. Now I suspect that western writers that reorganize and repackage Ramana, and boil ideas down to step by step methods, will work better for me."
3,In too deep...............,"""The Spiritual Teaching of Ramana Maharshi"" may be of inestimable value to intermediate and advanced spiritual seekers, but, without equivocation, most of the messages in this book are way, way over my head. While learning about this saint from other sources including some videos, it is apparent to me that he is extremely advanced and is therefore in such an exulted state that presenting truths to an exceptionally untried seeker (like myself) may be a bit challenging; akin to Stephen Hawking describing ""M Theory"" to a frog. In many ways this work is congruent with ""The Holy Science"" in as much as it reads like an auto repair manual. Also, I'm not typically a great fan of dialectic (i.e. question and answer) type of works - they just seem cumbersome.I'm sure that this book will have much value to other readers that are more spiritually mature than I am, but for me 3 stars on the board and a real 2.5 is all I can give."
4,one of the better ramana books...,"To those already familiar with ramana maharshi, a compilation book such as this, neatly organized into different topics, is more useful than some of the larger books such as 'Talks' where each and every conversation for a period of years has been recorded, so one is left to go through much repetition and questions put forth from seekers of different maturity levels. This book succeeds in culling the pearls of Ramana's sayings and putting it into one book. Other highly recommended books (after going through MANY) include Conscious Immortality, Erase the Ego, Sayings of Ramana Maharshi, Gems from Bhagavan, The Maharhsi and his Message (you can order at ashrama@aol.com)... and for those not aware of ramana, do become familiar with him...he is one of the great persons of the last century, although not very well known in India and abroad..."
5,know thy Self,"In my humble opinion, Ramana Maharshi was/is one of the greatest saints of the modern era. In this precious little book he speaks to us from the viewpoint of eternal Brahman, the Self of all, the ground of all Being. This wonderful little book is a collection of questions his many visitors would ask. His answers are as close to true knowledge of the Divine as anything i've ever heard or seen. This book is an excellent introduction to the sublime words and methods of this modern saint. This could be a very important guide for the sincere spiritual aspirant who wants to finally know his or her true identity. These truths can take us where knowledge is known by direct perception and words alone utterly fail us...ask yourself right this moment, ""Who am I?"" This book may help you get closer to the answer of that all-important question."
4,Very Practical,As good practical view of his method of enlightenment. Much of the book is in Q&A; format.Talks about the role of Ego as hindrance. The key seems to be to stop the mind thinking.
2,Simplistic and judgmental.,"A simplistic and overly moralistic work, in which Tyson states his own theories as fact (a tendency indulged in his other works as well). Watch out for Tyson's own innovations, which directly contradict most accepted theories/practices of other magickal schools of thought. Also painfully ignorant of Crowley/Thelema."
3,a magnifisent film,"Watching Jesus , brinks you years back like you lived that years with him but i believe that Franco Zeffirelli's ""Jesus of Nazareth"" is the best story , of the jesus life , in the history of cinema , and Robert Powell as Christ the best ever.............."
5,The best film on the Christ to date!,"Moving and inspiring, THE KING OF KINGS by DeMille has never been surpassed for its reverent treatment of the life of the Christ. H.B. Warner gives an impressive portrayal of Jesus that is not lost among the towering sets and mob scenes. This film version remains outstanding despite the lack of sound and color. One can only wish that DeMille had lived long enough to remake this movie with all the advances in cinematic science that we have today. Nevertheless, viewing his KING OF KINGS is still a devout experience. A must-see film for all movie buffs!"
2,Too small,"I was looking for something more sizeable. I do not even use it. For my needs, this was not good buy."
2,a bit wishy washy and cotton wool,Ratzinger is rather ambiguous in this book in certain doctrines. he doesn't sound 'staunch' or 'orthodox'. seems to be trying to please everyone and it gets 'foggy' at times. rather sad.
5,Ultimate chair,"This chair is basically a long term investment in your sitting comfort. If you spend long hours in front of a computer, it provides many adjustments to accommodate your experience. I have one built in 1997 and it has had minimal maintenance; the arm covers, the piston vertical adjustment mechanism, the back and seat fabric all have held up well. The forward and backward tension has weakened over the 16 yrs of ownership though. I would not call this a defect but an expected normal wear phenomenon. My wife bought another brand of chair several years after my first chair and this Aeron is to replace it. In contrast her chair looked like a refugee from a hobo camp. Go with quality and enjoy the ride."
4,Probably Right,"I think that he is probably correct that real estate processes will drop. Both his book and a magazine list San Diego as over valued. My apartment complex is going condo. I've decided not to buy. $295,000 for 866 square feet seems excessive. Now we have the fires out here, so I don't know what that will do to real estate values.His hedging schemes require money to hedge with. If you invest $100,000, you might make 50,000, but I don't think that you could get rich off his hedging schemes. I have some money in an international bond mutual fund, so I've had one of his hedges for some time. Maybe I'll invest in gold.He has one chapter on waves. I've heard that they're extremely hard to interpret which makes it hard to make predictions based on waves. I skipped most of that chapter."
3,Accurate Prediction But Now Past It's Shelf Life,"I bought this book in 2004 when many reviewers' were arguing that there was no real estate bubble. Now in 2008 it looks like the author was correct. If you read discussions on the website www.zillow.com , there are many people there who should have read this book. Had they read the book prior to 2005, they could have bailed out before the crash.Reading this book now is a waste of time."
3,Semi-Convincing,"The views in this book are one-sided and no counterarguments are made. The author successfully makes a convincing, although less than airtight, argument that there is a housing bubble, and it will burst while dragging the economy with it. If you want to understand the relationship between housing prices, financial markets, and the economy, then this is a great book to read. If you want find a balanced view of the future housing market trends, then this book is less than satisfying."
5,Advice Taken,"Two years ago I purchased Mr. Rubino's book. Back then the housing bubble was a seldom-discussed topic. For me, the information and advice made absolute sense. We sold our 5 acre property in Oregon and moved to be close to the kids. We are debt-free, have money in the bank, and will rent until the insanely high house prices decline to a reasonable level. Thank you Mr. Rubino. I could not be happier that I took your timely advice!"
1,not useful anymore,"If this is the first time you've thought of or talked to anyone about real estate, it's worth a read. You get some history. If you've read any newspaper, magazine or book about real estate in the last year, you don't have to read the first 3/4 of the book. It's the same stuff over and over again. The last part suggests stock picks, buying gold and holding cash. Financial advice should probably not be taken from a journalist anyway.If you're a contrarian, doesn't the bubble only burst when people say it's not going to burst?"
5,My granddaughter loves this book!!,"My granddaughter is 10 months old and truly LOVES this book. (She also loves the Backyardigans show.) There are fuzzy places for her to feel on each page and cut-outs as well. On the different pages I can ask her where things are (the various characters, a bird, a horse, a flag, etc.) and she will point to them. She knows where I keep this book and whenever she is with me she will go to that spot to get her book out. If you know any little ones that enjoy the Backyardigans this is a must have!"
4,A clever book,"This board book has clever cut-outs for the character's faces, eyes, etc. and our daughter loves books with holes in the pages. It gets 4 stars for the small amount of fuzz and weak storyline, but the book is worth while for the pictures and cut-outs."
1,Broken with a bad design,The unit cost almost as much to ship as the price of the unit. The design is not good and comes with no instructions (like in or out air line). The unit itself was broken (the plastic piece that holds the filter was broken in half and no longer held he filter in place). I was able to get a better designed/manufactured unit for about the same price at Home Depot. Note: It's not worth my time to return the unit. I show it to friends as an example of how you should be careful buying things on the internet.
3,Not sure The Prize is a Prize,"This book was OK but kinda disappointing for a Garwood book. There could have been so much more developed about the sling shot skills and everything was just kinda expected to happen. No real surprises or depth. Hate things like she picked up 3 rocks, used one and then put one back - what happened to the third one. Not to blow a story line but giving up her nephew was just like"" oh, there he goes...""."
3,fairy-tale romance,"Although I enjoyed the story overall, it was just so fairy-tale predictable. The characterizations of Nicholaa and Royce were good. The writing was rather elementary."
1,juvenile drivel,"Wow -- after all the great reviews here i thought i would give julie garwood a try. to my deep disappointment, she is dreadful. her dialogue is utterly stupid, her plot is nonsensical, and her characters are one-dimensional at best. what a waste of time. and just think of all the poor trees used to make this trash. horrid!"
3,A Nice Romp,"This was my first Julie Garwood novel and although I think she painted a great picture of the court of William the Conqueror and the typical castle intrigues of the era, I didn't find the heroine, Nicholaa, especially compelling. I like character-driven novels, and Nicholaa seemed frivolous to me, what with all the mixed and manipulative messages she cooked up for her husband, Royce. In all fairness, some romance novels do traffic in this light, almost comic interplay of conjugal misentendres, so I understand that this theme is often part of the genre. Thank heaven Nicholaa was good with a sling and could off a few miscreants along the way."
1,Review of Amazon download,"This is not actually a review of the product because I was never able to get the sample I requested. I attempted to download the sample of this book 5 times and each time the book that was downloaded was ""Sweet Talk"" by the same author. Unfortunately Amazon doesn't give the opportunity to actually reach customer services to report this type of malfunction. Very frustrating!@!!!!"
4,Loved the male hero,I liked this book simply because Royce wasn't overtly handsome and was disfigured with a scar. He didn't think he was a catch and was surprised when Nicholaa chose him. What she saw and loved was a handsome older man. He wasn't quite as arrogant and hot-headed as other Garwood male heroes who demand their brides marry them. He even waited for his bride to come around before bedding her.
1,vapid,"I'm generally a Garwood fan, but this one was just awful; predictable plot, shallow characters, all written at about a fourth grade level. I couldn't finish it."
5,Heart Warming Romance!!,Julie Garwood never disappoints me! The characters are have humor and spirit. I love this beautiful story. My only wish would be that she finish it! There is still Thurston and Justin...I would love to read what became of them!
4,Absolutely Terrific,"As with all of Julie Garwood's Historicals, her writing touches nearly all of my emotions from laughter through tears, and of course ending with joy.What more could you ask from a book?"
5,Garwood at her absolute best!!!,"Have read practically all her books and this is my absolute favourite. I read it, then as soon as i got to the end i started all over again. Nicholaa first appears to be brave, resourceful, then she spends the rest of the book crying, shouting and most annoyingly smiling. i love royce's little lectures whenever she does something bad. the scene where she tries to get him drunk is priceless! The best part of this book is that it is relatively stress free, no misunderstandings, or partings, I would love to see more of her brothers in another book, just to tie up some loose ends, otherewise it was perfect. I recommend it to anyone who likes historical romance."
2,garwood fan - disappointed this time,"I've loved many of Julie Garwood's novels in the past, but I found this one lacking. I didn't like the main character Royce. He seems to be telling Nicholaa what to do all the time and demanding her to obey. As for Nicholaa, she shows some spirit in the beginning of the novel, but she quickly bends to Royce and tries to make his life ""peaceful"".There was none of the great back and forth between the characters that Garwood's other novels contain. Royce seems to have well thought out wonderful reasons for all his commands and Nicholaa looks like a fool.My suggestion is to skip this book and read Ransom."
3,The Prize,This book was charming as Garwood's books usually are. It was also infuriating. You can't just say someone is strong-willed and independent. If their actions don't follow through with those statements it is not true. Nicholaa was angry through this entire book but never once gave Royce a piece of her mind. She was so flighty that one minute she would be raging inside and the next she would forget why she was angry and be telling Royce how patient he was with a peck on the cheek. She had no backbone at all. I almost wanted to throw the book a few times or yell at him for her. Arggghhh.
3,I like Julie Garwood - this book was a little lacking,"I like Julie Garwood's writing style. It's easy to ready & fast paced. I liked this book but didn't really love it. I thought when we first met Nicholaa she was really going to be something else. Clever, feisty, beautiful. She ends up being a totally different character. She will do anything to make Royce happy. It got really tiresome. I still enjoyed the story. It might have been better to see a little bit more tension with her older brother Thurston. He totally gets lost in the book."
2,Definitely NOT Garwood's best.....,"""The Prize"" was a horrible example of what I've come to expect from Julie Garwood. Usually, I can pick up a book written by Ms. Garwood without a second thought...that is how consistently wonderful she is...well..... ""The Prize"" left me cold. I have never read a book with characters as flat in my life....If this is your first Garwood experience, and you didn't like it...please give another one of her books a try...""Honor's Spendour"", ""Saving Grace"", and ""The Bride"", for example.....now those are GREAT books and properly show off Ms. Garwood's true talent to tell a story."
2,Childish and Lackluster!,"This is my first Garwood and because she comes so highly recommended I'll try another of her books. Hopefully they'll be better than this one! The plot is summed up nicely in other reviews so I won't repeat it.I found the dialogue childish and immature, esp. between the hero and heroine. It was like they were 10 years old!! I mean, I know they married young in the middle ages but geez!! The plot was so boring that 2/3 of the way through the book I realized I just didn't want to invest the time into finishing this book. Just not a good book overall!"
3,Ho-hum,"Saxon sister chooses to marry Norman soldier trainer when forced to choose by King William. She is beset challenges of having to deal with her loyalty to her family & new Norman rule of England as well as trying to have a more equal & loving partnership with her domineering but kind husband.This Garwood book wasn't too exciting compared to her other books (i.e., The Bride, The Wedding). Romance, sensuality, emotionality, & character development were only ok. Not bad but neither was it impressive.Partially recommended."
2,"Lots of potential, lack of follow-through","I tried very hard to love this book. Ms. Garwood has an amazing ability to produce good ideas for books but unfortunately she doesn't do much to expand on them. First and foremost is her apparent lack of either 1.)good writing skills or 2.) a good editor. She uses the words ""too,"" ""God's truth,"" and ""Tis' the truth"" more times than I can count. I also think that any good 11th grade English student could combine sentences better than what is presented in this book. I did like the characters and I thought she did a good job of showing them as newlyweds-so often romance novels end at the wedding or ""I've loved you since page 20."" It was refreshing to see a couple actually go through the rough spots of early marriage."
4,Searle's Most Important Work. A Must Read!,"The author's premise in this book is ""Man is an irrational animal."" This is a fascinating claim, although it had drawn some undeserved criticism. My only problem is the de Manian/Davidsonian twist he takes in the final chapter (read it and you will see!). But it is still everything you would expect from a top-notch philosopher and sociologist of knowledge."
2,Seriously in-depth critical analysis of social reality,"John Searle presents a critical analysis of the structure of social reality. In his theory of the mind he illustrates ""how it all hangs together"". He describes a world of reality where complex structure is invisible, and in which certain things only exist because we believe them to exist."
2,Poor Connection with Xbox 360 controller,"The headset works perfectly fine while it is connected properly; it just becomes disconnected incredibly easily. The speaker quality is surprisingly lower than expected since its such a cumbersome ear piece, but again, it should have a better fastener for the controller itself. I do not recomend this headset"
1,junk,this headset looks great but doesn't work. You can hear other people but you can't be heard when you talk on xbox live. save your money.
2,"It works for a little bit, but it will eat threw batteries",This headset looks really cool. I had no complains about the volume but where i did have problems...... it ate so many batteries. Don't buy rechargeable batteries. You will charge them all the way up and an hour later dead. If you have plug and play recharge kit it would be ok but in about a year or two you will run into problems and the headset will just stop working. Not that great
4,Easy Solution to Tightness,"Ok, so my Microsoft Mic grew a mind of its own and I had to thrown it away. So I went online and this looked like the best deal. It was. Perfect sound, I come across great. Yes, this headset is a bit tight. I wouldnt leave it on for more than an hour. BUT, this headset is loud. So what i do is put it around my neck, adjust the microphone, and it works fine. Only issue I have is adapter fall out easily. Otherwise great deal."
2,I probably dont recommend.,"I bought these in search of a nice headset just for chat. Most of the reviews on here talk about the tightness of the unit. Which is correct. But i can live with it. My biggest problem, is that it still aint as loud as i would like it to be,and ther is a slight buzz when i try to turn the sound all the way up. But it is still better than the regular headset you get with 360. I still would recommend getting the wireless unit. But if your in a tight money bind, then these would not be a bad purchase. I got mine for under 10 bucks on here."
1,Very Disappointed!!!,"I thought this was a great buy orignially but two weeks after my son received it the mic shorted out and was cutting out. Because of the terrible return policy, I was unable to get a full refund because it was purchased well before christmas and we didnt have the box still. Needless to say we would have paid to have it shipped back and had to incure a restocking fee and it wasnt worth it to waste any more money on it. I will not purchase this way again!!Xbox 360 Motorola Gaming Headset X205"
4,Cool product,"Overall, I like the headset very much. It works great. The biggest problem I have is that the pad opposite the earpiece is pretty hard. Maybe my head is too big, but it doesn't take long before it starts to hurt and I have to re-adjust the headset."
2,Xbox 360 Motorola Gaming Headset X205,"Xbox 360 Motorola Gaming Headset X205i have bought a few of these accessories but they all have had the same problem:the cable that connects the unit to the controller, in less than 2 weeks the wire had shorted out(probably due to extended use), and no sound will come out of the headphones.i can still talk into it which is completely pointless if i cant hear my team/party.to make things worse motorola doesnt have replacement cables!i would not recommend this to anyone unless they enjoy buying wires and dont play more than about an hour a dayi would stay away from motorola products all together"
1,be careful buying this,"I found this to be a bad purchase, i got 2 of these at the same time. Both had identical problems. Cord has some type of problem and you lose sound and cant talk without adjusting it. Both adapters had the tips break off which means i have to direct connect. They are comfortable for a short time, i think they have to much of a bend and after a while the side without the ear piece hurts your head. I have spent lots on headsets trying to find ""The One"" and this headset seems to have problems with the adapter staying into the controler compared to every other one i have tried. I will say 1 positive great sound brand new, and even for the first 2 months ( i use my headsets a lot for a long time each use.) Product just didnt stand up for the long run, sad because these used to be expensive headsets when i got mine."
2,Static and self removal,"Overall the headset just isnt good. It comes unconnected on its own frequently and not by me accidentally pulling it out. if the connected part turns slightly it just shuts off on its own. it is like having an old tv with an antenna and you have to move it and move it til you get the best picture, then you cant so much as breathe without screwing it up. i also find it to be fairly uncomfortable. It starts to hurt your ear after awhile. i would not advise anyone to purchase this headset."
2,Not right,"Good style, but came with a computer cord. The cord did not fit the x box. Thought it w3as a mistake, but returned & reordered and it was wrong again."
2,Head Ache,"Pro's: Durable, loud, detachable wires.Con's: Loud, Uncomfortable, and the Xbox live piece jack that plugs into the controller doesn't work. Its best to leave that part unplug.Looking for a durable controller, its for you. Depends if you want something that would squeeze your head. Hearing little kids yelling in the mic is pretty painful with this equipment on."
3,X-Box 360 Motorola Headset X205,"My son insisted on this particular headset for Christmas so after searching high and low and coming up empty handed, I turned to Amazon. I purchased the X205 through one of the vendors after reading all of the reviews posted about the product. Most people posted that nearly all of these headsets have some issue or another transmitting or hearing across a wireless connection and this headset is no exception. In my opinion, they all do have issues as we have 3 different brand headsets and none of them so far are perfect."
2,It's a headache. Both figuratively and literally.,"I bought it and wanted to like it. I've had it for a year but I NEVER actually use it. It works fine, but...* It gets is heavy after a while.* It pinches my head too much AND I am a little guy. I can't unbend it w/o breaking it.* I feel stupid wearing it.* It is big which makes it hard to store close to where I keep my stuff.* Not compatible with the chat pad* But the death nail is: IT DRAWS A LOT OF POWER!!!- I was constantly saying ""But, I just recharged these batteries"".- I HAVE to play with the ""Play & Charge"" just to power the thing.Summary: It is just too much of a headache. Both figuratively and literally.After writing the review, I think I am gonna resell it. Anyone want time?"
4,Nice but Heavy,Bought to use with Halo3 and the unit works very well. Unit is heavy after a couple of hours of gaming....overall good price and great quality.
1,motorola gaming headset,The motorola gaming headset is junk. One week into usig it and the adapter with the volume setting dials looses it's 3.5mm plug pen.Don't get it.
1,Poor Service,They sent the wrong item twice and then hassled us trying to return it ! Had to send picture of item to prove the wrong item was sent TWICE !
1,Do not buy!!!,"Mine worked, literally, for five minutes. The mic quit. Searching around the web, this was a common occurrence. Obviously, Motorola is dumping them on the public. They gotta know."
2,Make sure you are sent the correct game system headset.,"One pretty major problem. This may have been a mix up from Amazon distribution, but the headset did not actually fit the connector to the Xbox. It does fit PS3, but we had to buy an additional connection cable to convert to XBox. This was rather upsetting considering my son could not use the headset when he opened it on christmas day."
2,Gaming headset,"The headset works on the computer but not the Xbox....not sure what the problem is, we're still working on it.... Can't return it as in the fury of Christmas morning the box and paperwork was thrown out....He loves it for the computer...but that's not the reason it was purchased...."
1,dont get this!,This is a waste of plastic! it broke for no reason an never truly worked well and it is not very comfortable
1,Completely false name,"I bought this headset for my xbox 360...big mistake. though the title states it is for the 360 it comes with an 8-foot usb cable, not the standard plug-in for the 360 controller. Put simply this purchase was a total waste of my money"
3,Headset,"The headset it really nice and what I was looking for, just can't seem to figure out how to get it to work with my xbox. It just seems like its for the PS3 and not an Xbox."
4,Medicore,"Ok, well first off I am going to say that this headset is comftorable and I liked it, until one day it just broke, 2 of these headsets have broken on me and now its just annoying, but besides the part of them braking I liked it alot, another thing that is annoying though I kept it on for hours at a time or even just an hour and it would indent into my hair so that was annoying."
1,Do not buy this headset,"I bought this headset for a Christmas present, and it stopped working after 20 minutes of game play. I do not this was a new headset..rather a used trying to pass for a new one.I got this from Amazon and had to retun it the next day. I bought another one through Amazon, but this time I bought it from Tech Depot and it works perfectly."
4,help,i just got the mic today and i put it together and plug it it and it will not let me talk to my friends but it will let me here them. so what do i do.
1,Garbage....,I bought 3 of these headsets while they were on sale. Less than a week later 1 didn't work. Less than 6 months later I was having problems with the other two. Not happy!
1,Worthless.,This is a worthless headset unless you like feedback and static. The plug doesn't fit tightly causing poor audio quality. The adapter piece makes your mic have feedback and not using it means max volume and no mute capability. Spend the money on a better product.
1,Horrible,The headset didn't work at all. Period. Being so cheap I suppose I could cut the cord and dress up as my favorite NFL coach for the Super Bowl.
3,GREAT QUALITY BUT IT HURTS!,"GREAT ALL AROUND MIC. SOLIDLY BUILT, GREAT VOLUME, AND GREAT MIC QUALITY. BUT IT SQUEEZES YOUR HEAD VERY HARD AND IT HURTS! WOULD RECOMMEND THO"
1,Failure with two purchases,"I thought judging by the look of the headset, large ear cup design, noise canceling microphone, EA, and NFL logo that this was going to be an excellent product. I was wrong.With the first product the volume had to be turned all the way up and even then the sound was way to low. After a couple of tries nothing came through the headphones. I thought well its just a fluke.Then I was shocked to learn that the second headset that I purchased produced no sound. Just occasional static. Both headsets were tried on both Microsoft wireless controllers and new batteries were put in. Both were connected properly.I then purchased the Microsoft wired headset and it works great. Stick with Microsoft on this one. They also have a wireless version which would be worth checking out.The other minor downside is the tight feel. With some people it may be an issue after prolonged gaming. The Microsoft headset has a lighter feel and is more comfortable."
1,Double and Triple check...still doesn't matter!!!,"Be very careful when you order one of these if it's for an xbox 360. I bought one on eBay and even though the description said for xbox 360, it had an 8 ft usb cable NOT the 4 ft cable to plug into the controller. Ok so forget eBay, off to Amazon.com and I'll make sure the description says 4ft cable for xbox controller. WRONG, received the headset very quickly but it came with the 8ft usb cable. These units are for PS2, PS3 and the PC NOT XBOX 360!!! Guess I have to find a place that I can call before ordering and make sure it's not the usb version..."
4,what i thought of the Xbox 360 Gaming Headset X205,"I bought this headset so that i could heard better while playing halo 2, gears of war and other games better. From what i can tell in my 3 months of use is that it does greatly improve hearing and from what my friends tell me the sound quality appears better on the other side too. However there is a down side to this leviathan and that is its size. The dang this is big and almost throws you off balance, however i have gotten used to this. Also if used for more that like 3 1/2 hrs, the headset starts to jab the side of your head causing a slight pain. However if you are going for sound quality and not looks and comfort then this bad boy is for you!"
1,Bad product,These headsets do not work on the Xbox 360. We tried everything. We bought 2 and neither of them work.
4,Xbox 360 Motorola Gaming Headset X205,"Hurts the head after awhile. This is a durable headset with clear and loud audio. It work well, holds up for a long time, only drawback is it hurts your head after wearing for an hour or more."
1,Run AWAY!!!!!,A while back these were offered on woot for 6.99 each... me and my girl bought 3 apiece. This was less than a year ago. So a total of 6 headsets... and not a one of them still works. There is a design flaw somewhere in these things that caused them not to work. My first guess would be the wire from the controller but they made the side that plugs into the headset with a tongue and grove so you can't just go out and replace it... I am unhappy with them even at the 6.99 price... no telling how mad I would have been if I bought them at this price.
2,Not worth it,"I purchased this headset despite the reviews on various websites stating that the line has static or that the headset did not work outright. I did have issues with static however it worked for the most part. However, I put it in a box and left it for 3 months only to discover that the control box no longer works. If the headset is inserted the entire controller powers off. Save your money, these have too many issues and questionable quality."
2,Great concept BUT bad execution,I was tired of replacing the cheap Xbox headset every couple of months so I decided to invest a nice pair. I like the one-ear cup designs so I was excited when I found the Motorola. It feels and looks like a quality piece but after the second use it was already starting to show problems. At first the Mike began cutting in and out and a week or so later I began hearing alot of static every time I moved my controller. There must be a loose wiring because the only way I can get any sound out of it now is to keep the wire completely straight and not move my controller at all. Reeding the other reviews this problem seems to be hit and miss so buy at your own discretion. I'm currently shopping for a new pair.
2,"Ok, but kind of uncomfortable",This thing hugs the head so hard that it sometimes gives me a headache after long use. The cord started shorting out after 3 months of use. Great sound out of it though.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS HEADSET!!!!,this head set was ok for about the first week then came the static the adapter that plugs the headset into the controller is huge which makes it uncomfortable while playing if u rest the controller in your lap while playing b/c the adapter is always bumping into your body DO NOT BUY THIS HEADSET!!!
3,Headset for Call of Duty 3,Decent headset for COD 3 gameplay. Its a little umcomfortable and sometimes gets disconnected from the controller. I had to buy a 2nd one since the first one broke. Most of these headsets seem flimsy but this one seems to do the job for $25 bucks.
3,Haida Who? More Boleros Than A Spanish Fiesta,"In 1966 Alegre Records released Willie Rosario's Lp ""Haida Huo"", featuring among his band members, Alberto Beltràn on main vocals, Bobby Valentìn on trumpet, Rudy Martìn on piano, with Felo Brito and Adalberto Santiago on the chorus. With seven of the twelve recorded themes being 'boleros', this production can be remembered as Willie Rosario's bolero album. Nevertheless, the 'haitian güaracha' and title song ""Haida Huo"" comes out as a hot and frenetic dancing number. ""Por El Ojo De La Cerradura"", ""Cambia El Tumbao"" (Both of them, 'güarachas'),and the merengue ""Fiesta Cibaeña"" are also nice danceable themes."
5,Best brake pads,"I have used these Hawk pads on several vehicles from Jeeps to diesels and I have never been disappointed. As long as the pads are properly burnished, they will provide a significantly improved brake response."
4,Great Documentary,I originally saw this documentary on PBS and thought it was a great recap of the last 100 years of the Olympic Games. I am glad to see that it is now on video.
4,Their Best,"This singer is so much better than that other guy who sings through his nose. Many of you may not be aware of this bit of trivia, but the other singer sang all of ""Flirtin' With Disaster"" through his nose without moving his lips at all. His jaw was wired shut at the time due to an accident.Lady Luck is my favorite song from this cd. They played it on the radio back when the album first came out but I guess the public didn't like the new singer. All the songs rock though."
1,Bad case,The magnet in the case lid interferes with the operation of the device. It changes the display and launches applications. The seller was not at all helpful in resolving this. I won't buy from them again.
