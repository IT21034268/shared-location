2,Started well enough,"This book started with a great premise: a cop's murder is made up to look like a suicide. It slows down to a snooze inducing drag by 2/3, and the big DEA showdown in Mexico becomes so stupid that it's hard not to toss the book across the room. It's only when the real ending, from the meeting at the castled to the end, starts up, that the book picks up it's lost momentum and comes to an interesting and satisfying close."
3,THE BLACK ICE,"Ok not as fast moving as I like, but I still liked it,Harry is a sympathetic character and a good guy"
4,Great Suspense!,"Well written and not a predictable plot line. Great summer read! I will read more of this series. Harry is real character, if you are looking for the handsome romance novel hero, Harry misses the mark by a long shot. He is crass, but real."
4,Great Second Venture into Harry Bosch's world,"This is my second Harry Bosch novel and I have to say, I'm really starting to like the guy! I don't like giving away plots with crime novels, but know that the story moves along very quickly and there are plenty of twists and turns. Much of the action takes place in parts of the U.S. and Mexico that I am unfamiliar with, so I was pulling up a map quite a few times, which turned out to be more than a little fun!I'm glad to have followed a suggestion to read the Harry Bosch series in order, as there were references to events in The Black Echo. By no means does the reader need to have read The Black Echo first, it was just neat to be ""in the know"" on a few things.Overall, this is a very enjoyable read. It seems Michael Connelly will never fail to entertain me, and I cannot wait to start reading The Concrete Blonde."
3,The Black Ice,"I have read several of Michael Connelly's books via Kindle, but this one is hard to read because there are so many errors in the kindle edition. For instance, when you turn a page it doesn't match the previous page. The last sentence isn't finished or in other cases it is repeated. This happens so frequently it is very annoying and distracting. I'm sorry I bought this, with so many others to choose from."
4,Ghosts from the past,"It is Christmas, and Harry Bosch is on standby to take calls for any murders. He has the police scanner on, and hears a report of an incident within his jurisdiction. When he investigates, he becomes involved in a messy case involving a police officer. Things develop from there.There is a lot about bureaucracy and bean counting in the police department. Increase the number of arrests and increase the percentage of solved cases to make the atatistics look good when the budget request goes in. There are continuing conflicts between Harry and his superiors, but there are some tradeoffs. Not everything is as it seems, but everyone seems to come away with something. Sometimes it's better not to look too close.Black ice, by the way, is a new form of narcotic - an emerging recreational drug showing up on the scene.The novel is also available as part of the omnibus collection, ""The Harry Bosch Novels."""
4,Another Winner From Connelly,"Although this book is not quite as good as the first Bosch novel, The Black Echo, it is still amazing. Connelly is a great mystery writer and his characters are fully developed. The plot moves along at a rapid pace and the ending is completely satisfying. So many times when you read a mystery, the suspense builds and the ending is always a let down. Michael Connelly never lets you down. Well written and a great read."
5,"Suspenseful, character driven.","A suspenseful, character driven mystery novel that grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go until the satisfying and surprising conclusion. Bosch, a true maverick hero, is one of my favorite characters in the genre (and I love his taste in music).Connelly skillfully overlaps law enforcement with the criminal world. Some of the so-called good guys seem just as rotten as the bad guys, and Connelly doesn't make excuses for anyone. The only complaint I have with the book is that everyone seems to be against Bosch, and it gets a little frustrating. But it is a very minor complaint and isn't enough to take away from the five-star rating. I can't wait to read the rest."
3,"Good, but lacking at times.","I've a big fan of Connelly's Hary Bosch. However, I didn't enjoy this book as much as I have his others. It was good, but at times, the plot seemed forced and lacked Connelly's usual style of non-stop action and suspense."
3,Black Ice,Rec. book on time - have not read yet! need eleven more words - need seven more words - two more then LIFT OFF
3,"Okay,but it didn't hook me","It was a decent book, but it didn't hook me. I could take it or leave it. This was my first Harry Bouch novel, I might try another..."
4,i found out who i was,"I am a Michael Connelly fan and found The Black Ice not as satisfying as his other works to some degree, but still way ahead of his competition. There was the usual brilliant writing I'm accustomed to with Connelly, but the story dragged a little more than usual in some spots. My big wish for this novel was that it skipped the romance (two different women in one week?) Still, being a Connelly apologist, they only took a couple of pages. All in all I did enjoy this mystery that took Bosch to Calexico (a California border town) and Mexacali south of the border. Recommend."
1,AUDIO TAPE WARNING - MULTI-TRACK STEREO,"Just a warning to all the audiobook listeners out there. The unabridged cassette tapes are multi-track stereo meaning that the cheap publisher uses the left and right channels to record separate chapters. So unless you have a headphone splitter the tape will not work correctly. I fail to understand why in this day and age, the publishers can't spend a few more pennies and put the 4 additional tapes in the box. If AOL can send out about a bizillion CD's a year for free, why can't this publibsher spring for some old fashon cassettes!I listened to about 5 minutes of it and couldn't stand it any longer. I would have returned it had it not been past the 30 days for Amazon's return policy."
2,Reign of Fire PS2 Game,"I bought this [...] and I think I made agood choice. Reign of Fire is a decent game, especially thedriving and shooting format of it. When I bought it, I though it was a 3rd person shooter, where your guy runs around (Die Hard Trilogy for PS). Plenty of Dragons, shooting and driving.But then, that's all there is to it, just drive, shoot and try not to get killed by the dragons in the air. Woo hoo.It took me a while to get used to it, as with everything, but the graphics are okay, the driving and shooting system is fun and simple, and the voice acting is similar to the movie's characters. Overall, great game if you've got the patience for it. (I do.)"
2,i cont rate this very accurately,"i havent played the gba version of rof, but the xbox version was horrible. the gba will be missing the one good thing about the xbox version- the good graphics. i dont know how much this helped."
2,Okay,"I brought this and didn't pay attention that it was the Play instead of a movie. When I got it I just tossed it on the shelf. The other day I think this was on BET and I watched some of it, not bad..."
4,David Talbert,David Talbert is a brilliant writer and director. I think he's a bit overshadowed by the Tyler Perry craze and dont get me wrong Tyler is the man but there are other writers and directors out here. In all David's play are wonderful and I can relate to many of the subject matters. I recommend this to anyone who's looking for Christian based entertainment.
3,Pretty good,"I enjoyed the plays each of them had a meaning, on fabric of a man i was expecting a lil bit more but it was still good"
4,"David E,.Talbert Review",I appreciate being able to learn and understand from black people in a Christian form of entertainment; these were some wonderful and beautifully written plays; I laughed as well as cried and could relate to them. I reccommend these plays to all people.
1,HORRIBLE MOVIE,"I HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THIS MOVIE SO I PURCHASED IT, SADLY TO SAY THAT IT WAS SO BAD THAT I COULDNT EVEN FINISH IT, I COULD ONLY WATCH LIKE THE FIRST 20 MIN. OF THE MOVIE AND THE ACTING WAS HORRIBLE, PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR ,MONEY ON THIS ,MOVIE"
4,"he say, she say, but what does God say?",Out of the 3 pack this was the one i liked best. This play was very entertaining. I recommend seeing all of David Talbert's plays.
4,david talbert 3-pack,I really enjoyed the plays and well worth the money.I will be ordering the other two plays that David Talbert has put out.
2,More like 2.5,"It was okay, the beginning was very slow and I lost interest a few times. About an hour into it, it picked up and held my attention. I guess I missed the laugh out loud moments that others mentioned in there reviews and the singing was average. Perhaps TP has spoiled me but I didn't care for the choir director's voice. There were No BIG stand out messages or memoriable parts. Nephew Tommy was good but he just wasn't believable as a thug/drug dealer mostly because I'm use to his comic side on the Steve Harvey Morning Show and his side kick D is also a comedian so their roles to be were like Blah. I say rent it or borrow it, or if you can get a $4.50 deal from one of the market sellers like I did then its worth the purchase if you like collection black stage plays."
2,"Rent if you want to see, not a collectors item","These plays were okay, I'm glad I rented them before buying them. The props and things were very nice, the actors didn't gel well with each other or connect with their characters and the singing was mediocre ( definitely no Tyler Perry quality on that note) but the messages were good just seemed a little unrealistic and too drawn out. I thought Alexander O'Neal sang in one of them but he didn't."
2,Okay,"Not really an attention grabber. I have tried to watch this video at least three or four times but can't stay woke. So basically, it puts me to sleep. SORRY but it could definitely use a lot more."
2,Not recommended,I would not recommend purchasing the 3-pack. I only enjoyed one out of the three plays. Love On Layaway was the only one worth watching... i just could not get into the other 2 and I love David E. Talbert though.
2,Very loud!,"This play has a plot that is just ok in my opinion. I watched it three times because I really thought it was just too loud at first. So I guess I will say this, if you are used to a lot of high powered, over singing gospel singers who are portraying their claim to fame on the camera....this will be a great play for you and you will enjoy it. I personally missed out on the theme of it because of all of the over dramatic actors in it. I like David Talbert's work however this one needs to be made over. (Even turning down the volume does not help). Seriously!"
3,ALL GUIDE TO CLASSIC MUSIC,"I'LL SAY IT'S FAIR IN THE REVIEW. SOME CONDUCTORS WHERE NOT MENTIONED,OUT DATED WITH CONDUCTORS NOW LIVING AND MAY BE NOT LIVING SOME NEWERCONDUCTORS THAT ARE NEW WHERE NOT EVEN MENTIONED, SO I WOULD SAY ITS FAIRNOT ENOUGH WHEN INTO RESEARCH ON CERTAIN, IN CLOSING SHOULD HAVE BEENIMPROVED."
3,Very basic,"This is a decent video if all your looking for is the absolute basics of telescopes and binoculars. The title, to me, is misleading. it isn't ""ALL ABOUT..."" or even close to being that. This isn't to say this video doesn't have value, it does. It does review different types of telescopes, but not much on how to use them. It does cover a number of different areas such as ""seeing"", filters, mounts, etc, however it goes into very little detail. In some cases it doesn't go any further than to say you can do a particular thing. If you're looking for a video on telescopes and binoculars, just keep in mind this is a very basic one. You will find MUCH more information from the many books that are available on this same topic."
2,Too far a stretch.,"I'm not excited by these remixes, though I have very much enjoyed remixes from the bebop/cool 1950's and the R&B;/Funk 1960's.These recordings originally came out around the Depression and WWII, and were originally intended to offer a tender hand of support to the radio listener or dancehall dancer during some lean and uncertain times. Intimacy, warmth, patriotism and encouragement were key.Now, to hear them all filtered and treated and chopped..... sounds, I dunno, disrespectful to me, almost unpatriotic even! (Never thought I'd feel this way). A sort of flippant, coked-out, po-mo ultra-coolness permeates these songs... and it isn't working for me (though, as I say, it DOES work on other genres or manifestations of American pop music...)Am I saying that 1940's Big Band is a little bit.... sacred? Yeah, I guess that's what I'm saying."
2,Not recommended for fans of big band,"I listen to War-Era jazz, especially Big Band, most of the day. When I'm not, I'll sometimes listen to techno/trance, especially if I have a lot of work to get done. So when I saw this album, I was interested. Well... there's a lot of talent here; these 'mixologists' are pretty good. Kudos to them. But, unfortunately that Big Band sound is lost in the mix. It's just not there."
2,The Big Band Era deserves more,"The concept is brilliant, but this compilation is way off the mark. The overall sound of this album seems clumsy and doesn't mesh well at all. It comes across like an afterthought. Maybe DJ Krush could have done a better job."
3,Tired Read,Very dry read. Complicated and confusing order of addressing topics. Reading for my developmental psych class felt like a chore with this book.
2,Light on Content,"Let me begin by saying that I was slightly disappointed by this purchase. I had hoped for an in-depth discussion of riding technique, providing useful insight on bike control and operation.What I got, however, was page after page of misty eyed reminiscences about the ""good old days"" of motorcycle racing. While interesting, this is not what I was hoping for in a book about riding skills.Actual technique sections were rather light on detail, and provided no more information than even the most basic of motorcycle instruction courses. Essentially the book could be summed up by just writing in big letters ""DO EVERYTHING SMOOTHLY"", and leaving it at that.On the other hand, this book might be useful for people who have just begun riding a bike, and have not undergone any instruction."
1,Category should be autobiography or advertisement for his CLASS school,"For me, this book is more like Reg's autobiography or big advertisement for this CLASS school.There are so many pages, dedicated to his background and achievements and his CLASS school, it really distracted flow of reading.Even I strongly agree with his emphasized smoothness of riding, I would not recommend this book to anyone because there are other excellent books already talking same principles in better format."
5,great condition and very good book,"from a bagger to a sport tour big difference, Reg was extreamely helpful in his teaching, if i had the cash arround i will take his CLASS love his book"
3,"The Pridmore, the Pridmore, the Pridmore...way",Just too much personal history. If Reg is your hero this is for you. If you are trying to learn to or improve your riding... There are some useful tips and techniques and things to think about in this book. Nothing I had not come across elsewhere though. Some things I would question. Just worth it.
1,not worth the price you paid.,"I collect historical fiction books. From Jean Auel to Sue Harrison to Linda Lay Shuler to Mr. and Mrs. Gear and William Sarabande and Joan Wolf. 90 in all to date. The only books I have thrown out have been everything written by Allen. It was an chore to read the Mammoth Stone. There wasen't any historical detail or true settings. It didn't have the feel of an researched book, it read more like science fiction than historical."
1,An ancient Native American with one green and one blue eye?,Nothing in this book is believable or even remotely plusable. The author takes way too many liberties with the facts of history.The book even has trouble if you try to chalk it up as a science fiction book.
1,Not actual poster!,"Bought a few posters for my daughters room and opened this one and its nothing more than a printed scan image of an actual poster! It comes on thin paper (just longer and bigger) not the slick poster paper. Wow, if I hadn't waited a month to open these and I would sent it back! Wow, I feel ripped off at paying $4.99 plus the high cost of shipping for not an actual poster."
2,Razor Child Helmet,"The helmets were for smaller children than my 6 and 10 year old grand children and the China Source created concern for: lead in paint, materials with harmful contamients for which I want reassurance that they are harmless to my young children. eeh"
2,Not a youth size helmet,"While the quality of the helmet is decent for what it is - it's a bike helmet with a face guard - I was very disappointed with the over-sized fit. The packaging says it's a youth helmet, but the helmet itself is labeled as a 'Medium', and I've got to believe that means 'adult medium'. I'm a 6'6"" adult, and this helmet fits snugly on me (with all the internal velcro pads still in place) - the thing is way too big for my son's head. Buyer beware: I didn't think that Razor could screw up a bike helmet too badly, but this helmet is unusable for the average 8-year-old child unless they wear a knit cap underneath."
2,Missing Extra Pads - Old School Chin Strap :(,"We already bought the black version of this helmet for our kids. However, we needed another helmet and decided to add the red version since it would be familiar and easy to use. Unfortunately it did not come with the extra pads that are supposed to be included as listed in the features. Also, the chin strap on the red helmet is not a simple click open/closed buckle but it is more like a 1970's loop in/over/through style that is nowhere near as quick and easy for kids to learn to use. Build quality of the helmet is great but it's other features are definitely lacking and need to be upgraded to the same standards as the black helmet. This one will definitely be going back to be replaced by another black helmet."
3,"Expensive, cheap, short","This is a short book, about 18000 words, almost a pamphlet. For the price there isn't much content, and the book is cheaply made. If it cost $1 or were given away, I would give it another star. I read it in a day, by the end of the day the binding had already cracked, and the book was falling apart.The ideas have some merit, but the book also has the flavor of an advertisment, pitching the author's website and materials there.If you find a copy, or someone loans it to you, it's just about worth the time to read it. But it makes for an expensive purchase."
3,ok for the price,"The foundational ideas seem solid, but the confused verbosity of the presentation distracts from the issues. Perhaps it is good that it is short.My copy fell apart before I was half done. But I would probably buy it again. While none of the philosophy is overly original, the content does reflect some of the authors well thought out personal insights.The main area I find to disagree is that the author is still fixated on a correlation between knowledge and finding a job. I, and others before me, have realized that as we leave the bureaucratic age behind, ""self"" will become the largest employer. A reputation of possessing a love of learning is becoming a necessary networking tool for self employment.To paraphrase one of the author's insights, ""What you know is becoming more important than where you learned it."""
5,"A book needed now, more than ever","As a manager in a large corporation, I know the constraints organizations have in adequately training their employees. No matter how good a company is when training their employees, the quickly changing knowledge and skill requirements of today's marketplace require that employees be proactive in obtaining their own training. If someone reading this book only takes away the idea that training and education is something you take, as opposed to something you get, the book is worth reading. But luckily this book offers lots of other useful information and advice. I was so impressed with this book that I bought every member of my staff a copy."
4,48 inch fan with realistic leaf design,"AWESOME! We have high ceilings and I wanted something dramatic in the family room. This fan was perfect and it looks great with our decor. It was packaged well and my husband was able to install fairly quickly. If you have any type of leaf or nature motif in your home and you're looking for something Lowe's or Home Depot doesn't have, this unique fan is for you!"
4,Poetically Challenged,"I have always felt poetically challenged; poetry was something other people got, but not me. This books, especially the early parts. has been a big help with understanding poetry. For example, I realize there is some poetry that requires a lot of work (historical understanding of the poet, and sometimes the subject matter, and also a need for a dictionary or two); however, there is lot of other poetry that is written in plain English. So, I now have a collection of poems of the latter type that I enjoy while leaving to another day, if ever, those other poems written for the more sophisticated reader."
3,I do not like the taste.,I did try many different Yogi Tea and this one has terrible taste. Even adding fresh mint or slice of lemon does not help.
3,Gray Man movie,"We bought the Gray Man because we were in the movie. We were disappointed because a lot of the better scenes, not the ones with us in them, were not used. We spent a lot of time with the crew so we saw a lot of the shoots. It would have been a more interesting movie had they kept it as shot. I guess this happens in every movie."
1,Another film is the true story,"To see the true story, and an even more graphic depiction of events, see the film: Albert Fish, In Sin He Found Salvation."
2,There are better and less expensive microphones than this,"The AT831cW Lavalier Microphone is small, solid and sounds fine. The problem is the cable. The cable is too fragile, it breaks easily and needs to be replaced every couple of years, or sooner. The fun part of it is that you cannot purchase the cable alone - without the microphone on it (although the mic can be unscrewed) - and so, it's a $75 a pop expense.The transmitters are very poorly designed.Overall: AVOID."
5,This is AWESOME! I am ordering more!,I have started using Herbs for Kids and was switching between the Elderberry Syrup and the Cherry Bark. The Elderberry syrup seems to help a stuffy nose while I could just feel the mullein working in the Cherry Bark Blend. My baby and I have been having a dry cough at night and this really helped and opened our lungs and best of all its safe for him and for me. I highly recommend Herbs for Kids. Baby loves the flavor and will take it anytime I offer it to him.
3,recommended--guardedly,"This is a succinct and serviceable--even useful--introduction to scales for the beginning guitarist--especially the beginning rock or jazz guitarist. Its form has its inherent limitations, of course, and only anhematonic (that is, ""major"" or ""minor"") pentatonic scales are included. The beginning guitarist might do well to start with this and then go on to PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns. (He should not be intimidated by the title.)"
2,"savidge, vradenburg book","I don't like the book or the CD, the playing is too programmed and the choice of scales is very limited."
1,A difficult to understand book,I am a literate mature ( old guy ) man with a Masters in Fine Art. The music concepts are explained out of sequence. The text explains intervals in steps and half steps and 2 pages later explains what a half step is. I have been studying with a professional for 2 years now. The order of presentation is dis orienting and confusing ...Two years ago this book was of no help at all.
4,Andis flat top clipper comb,I just started cutting my husbands hair. This comb helps me to cut his flat top. I would buy another.
4,Knitting freedom,"Have you ever felt frustrated by the limitations of commercial knitting patterns that dictate what yarn and gauge you must use? Do you ever find a great pattern, only to see that it isn't written for your size? Have you ever wondered how the heck the knitters of the past managed to make all those pretty sweaters without patterns?If so, Elizabeth Zimmermann's humorous, intelligent, even reckless approach to knitting (she cuts into her work! deliberately creates runs! mixes dye lots!) might free you to break loose.From a deep knowledge of knitting history and technique, Zimmermann demystifies the craft and gives both the instructions and the ""permission"" a knitter might need to truly make knitting her own."
2,knitting WITH tears for beginners,"I bought this book thinking it was for a beginner, I have since expanded my knitting skills and have become much more advanced. Even as a advanced knitter, this book for me was hard to follow. The directions written in general terms and not as clear and concise as I would like. I guess I am a little anal about the kind of pattern I like. Specific number of stiches, not 23% of total number of stiches on needle #3 and 35% on needle # 4. This book is not for anyone who is not very good with numbers, especially percentages."
2,No tears,This is a wonderful book from a real legend in the knitting world. Elizabeth Zimmerman's books really help you walk through the whole process of knitting. Her one-of-a-kind personality that revolutionized the knitting world comes through in this book.
3,Not for visual learners,"Elizabeth Zimmerman's popular book, Knitting without Tears, almost left me in tears. It has very few illustrations, so if you are a visual learner, be forewarned. Although her instructions are clearly written, I found the lack of illustrations frustrating."
3,Not the best choice for new knitters,"This book is filled with great tips, tricks, and pattern ideas that will give you confidence to break away from store bought patterns and go it on your own.BUT, not if you are a new knitter like me. The illustrations are informative, but very sparse. There is little information on sizing, and the writer assumes you are already familiar with shaping. I'm sure this book will be very useful for me..a couple of months down the road. For now it is just a dust collector."
3,fun to read -- BUT,"EZ's breezy style is fun and inspiring, it's a good theory book, but her actual patterns are vague and not so easy to follow. I made one of the hats she described and had to do quite a bit of unraveling and puzzling over her instructions to get it to come out decent. For a more specific guide to knitting sweaters in the round, try Ann Budd's ""Book of Sweater Patterns""."
3,knitting books,I have been purchasing a lot of knitting and crocheting books lately because i wanted to get new ideas. My first impression when i opened this book was to be a bit upset that it wasn't what i expected but after i started leafing through i started reading bits and pieces and actually i got some good ideas from her and all i got to say is that don't judge THIS BOOK BY THE FIRST PAGES OR EXPECT SOMETHING ELSE BY LOOKING AT THE COVER. It's informative and that is what i wanted so i shouldn't complain.
3,Needs less story and more pictures and instructions,"If you are looking for a book to really give you some good instruction this is not the one. I checked it out from the library and am glad I didn't buy it. This is probably why they don't show you any of the pages with the (very few indeed) hand draw pencil pictures. I have a new system for the books (if they are available). I check them out from the libray first and if I think I need them then I buy them. What I really want is a book that has visuals of different stitches you would use to make a pattern besides knit and purl. I want to see photos of cable knitting, yarn overs, drop stitches, finishing a turtleneck and so forth. I guess some of us need to get together and write our own book."
3,Good book for beginner knitters,"I've been knitting for 54 years, and am pretty entrenched in my ways, but this book did tell me some new things. I don't want to knit the way EZ does it, but for a new knitter, this book may give he/she some new ideas to think about."
4,It's Her Opinion,"Who am I to disagree with the queen of knitting? I appreciate Elizabeth Zimmerman's no nonense approach to knitting. And I do think her instructions make a lot of sense. But, I am still grappling with making a steek with your first sweater. That is something I would no do on my own.If you are starting outin knitting and have fears, this book can do much to banish them."
4,Gift,This item was a gift. Haven't heard any complaints as of yet. . . I will update if any issues arise
1,No pictures. Not for dummies like me. Disappointed.,"I agree with the reviewer who was disappointed because there are no pictures. I didn't realize that I was a visual learner, but when I received this book I felt that it was almost useless to me. I am going to chalk this purchase up to ""lessons learned"". This was my error, not the book or author's fault. But if you expect a fun, easy to use book with lots of drawings, (i.e Stitch and Bitch, or Knit Girl), this is not for you. Happy Knitting!"
1,Not very good for beginning knitting students,"This book is more a collection of essays and the opinions of a knitter from a long time age. I read her instructions on how to fix a dropped stitch and forget it -she is not very clear about how to do this. Stitch and Bitch by Debbie Stoller is a great book for beginning knitters. I've owned Knitting w/o tears for over 10 years and I find it boring. It certainly lacks illustrations. Yes, she gives you ideas for patterns but doesn't teach you how to do things. Of course, she has her devotees. I for one, found this book to be useless. It is very dated. This book might be great for super advanced knitters who are of her generation."
3,Knitting without tears,"will give you a headache if you are an experienced knitter. very few pictures and the ones that do exist are not of good quality. It does have great technical information but for the new knitter, there is not enough meat on the bone."
3,Not what I expected,"I expected something a little more complete and well written.However, I found the book dull, the pcitures were very poor and hard to figure out and hard to deciper. Certainly the editors could have found someone with better illustration skills or even included some good photos.For such an expert, I am very surprised. This is the first Edwards book I have ordered and it may be the last."
5,Great First Book of EZ's to Read,"I have a number of Elizabeth Zimmermann's (EZ) books. This was the very first one. The sample pages shown at Amazon do not show you accurately how interesting this book is. There is a Snail Hat in the book which I am eager to make. I modified the Baby Pad, and am making a blanket from that pattern. I think new and long time knitters would enjoy this book. If you go to SchoolHousePress on-line, you can find yarns to use in knitting these patterns. The staff there are very nice, also."
2,Too Much Hype,"This book has been hyped up so much by reviewers and other knitters. I found her writing to be disorganized and not as useful as I had hoped. I was hoping I would be able to break away from using patterns, but this book did nothing for that. Her percentages method was not explained. How did she come to use percentages? Who knows. Obviously Elizabeth was a talented woman, but, in my opinion, not able to translate her knowledge very well. I will keep looking."
4,Not for most beginners,"If you are looking for a good how to knit book, with step-by-step instructions on the basics this book isn't it. It is a wonderful book--take a look at it once you've mastered the basics and are ready to move past patterns and create something entirely your own."
5,Knittiing,"I'm a knitter. I wanted this book for my library so when I knit sweaters I don't do it in pieces but from the top down. Elizabeth Zimmermann thinks much like I do. I don't like purling or sewing pieces of a sweater together so she has given me the seamless sweater. This book is so full of help for knitters, it is a must read and reference."
2,Not one of my favorites,"I had heard so much about EZ that I rushed out to buy this book. I was really disappointed by this book. I expected to find information as a beginning knitter, but this book seemed to be geared towards knitters who are more experienced.I do like the homey style and the fact that Elizabeth Zimmermann was a knitting enthusiast, but this is a book that should be added to the knitter's library later on, once technique and method has been established."
4,A really good knitting read,"This is not a knitting manual, its a really lovely read. Elizabeth gives knitting personality and life. She explains why we knit in the first place and then she breaks it all down into simple construction principles. This book is not for beginners, it has limited images and referencing."
2,Overrated in the extreme,I bought this book four years ago (mine has a red cover) and I have yet to use it for anything. I understand she is revered for her 'percentage' method but in my opinion the sweaters and caps in the (boring b&w) photos look very coarse and often downright ugly. If this is what the percentage method yields you can have it. I've turned to this book looking for tips and inspiration more times than I care to remember and am always disappointed. It took writing a review of her daughter's boring book to wake up and realize I should have listed it on eBay ages ago. I'm writing this review because so many people rave about Zimmerman that I felt a little balance was in order.
2,too complicated for beginner knitters,This book is too advanced for beginners and should be an intermediate to advanced book.
5,This book hits the nail on the head,"Since I'm a fairly new knitter, I appreciate the down to earth directions and the accompanying photographs. East to follow."
1,Not as the picture shows,"This lamb is laying down and is about 12"" or less long. It does not sit as in the picture and I would not describe it as a pillow pal (not like the ones you can use as a pillow). Very unsatisfied with the description online. I never would have paid $5 s/h if I had known I was getting this small thing!"
4,"Fun for kids, not really that instructional","This video has 3 different sections, jazz, tap, and ballet. It doesn't really show you exactly how to do too many of the steps or positions, it gives kids an idea of what goes on in a children's dance class. I think it also, unfortunately, gives the impression that you go to a class or two and then you can do the combination at the end of the sections. My Kindergarten-aged daughter does, however, like to try some of the moves (especially ballet) along with the dvd. For anyone looking for detailed instruction, this isn't it. But, for fun and maybe some introduction to dance, it is fine."
4,"Good workout for grownups, but a little fast paced for kids","I bought this for my daughter when she started dance class, and it quickly moves beyond the level her Ballet/Tap class reaches, into combinations which are actually pretty difficult. Having said that, she enjoys dancing along with the DVD, even though she's nowhere close to doing the moves, and I've had a lot of fun dancing with her, and have noticed that doing all the moves is quite a workout. I suspect there are better instructional DVDs out there for kids, but this one is about the right pace for this mid-30s mom :)"
1,Good box; terrible service,"FedEx Freight damaged my toolbox in transit. I fought with them for a month to pick it up and return it to Grizzly. The entire time, Grizzly wouldn't help out. They just repeated ""we aren't the shipper"". They said they'd send a new one when the old one arrived back in Washington, but after three weeks they actually offered to send one as soon as the old box was picked up by FedEx. Sadly, FedEx coudln't return phone calls and blew off pick up appointment. Grizzly stood back and waited for me to fix the problem.Never again Grizzly. You've lost me as a customer.It was a good tool box too.If I was in charge of Grzzly, I would have (after a week) offered to ship out a new one - and charged if the old one didn't come back. I would have offered free shipping, or 10% off or *something* to show that I cared about a problem the customer didn't cause, and was making an honest effort to solve.They couldn't be bothered."
5,The Education of Little Tree,"This was a well written and portrayed glimpse into what life was like for a Native American boy as well as the values and tradition of the family. It was authentic as far as it went and something all children and adults who think the treatment of the Native children was not harsh should see. I would highly recommend this to everyone intested in true history, not whitewashed half-truths."
3,Okay but....,"Doesn't really follow the book. Other things movie makers need to is focus on logic of the charactors. It was quite obvious that he could have just rolled under the gates at the school, rather than bust them open."
1,Politically Correct,"I rented this movie and was initially delighted with the cinamotography and actors. Not long into the film the thrust of the message became overt: all things Indian are wise, good and wonderful; all things white or Christian are hypocritic, laughable and not to be trusted. The writer commited the same atrocity on whites and Christians that was done to American Indians by the U.S. government and white settlers that were biggoted, selfish and downright evil. You don't right wrongs by portraying history incorrectly or by blanket statements that condem all. In the end, what could have been a good movie became predictable, a lie and boring."
1,bad movie,"This movie was horrible. My five children ages 7-15 all walked away from it after 45 minutes. My wife and I continued to watch it for another 15 minutes, then we couldn't take it anymore and shut it off. The movie critisises on numerous occasions Christians and also white people in general, and the ""grandpa"" blasphemes and curses throughout the movie. Also, grandpa makes illegal whiskey and teaches his grandson the ""trade"" and also teaches him to lie to cover it up. If there was a 0 star rating, that is what I would give this movie. Do not waste your time."
5,Amazing Movie,"This movie was so good that it made me cry. I will watch it many times, and have my kids watch it when they grow up."
4,The Education of Little Tree,"This is a wonderful movie!! Such a heart warming story that is so rare any more. It is a very hard movie to find. I did have to purchase a used movie, and I would have preferred to have a new one, but could not pay the price for a new one."
2,"very good movie, but my tape sounds warbled","My sound quality on this vhs tape is warbly sounding. I didn't ask to send it back, because it is a hard to find video. I wanted a dvde instead, but there aren't any available in this country I guess."
1,The Education of Little Tree,"I was very disappointed with this film. With all the talented actors in the cast, I don't understand why it was so blah. I read and enjoyed the book, and was looking forward to the movie, but was mega disappointed."
5,Excellent Family Movie,"This true story (with some input from Hollywood) is a heart warmer and at times heart wrenching, but well worth the watch. Little Tree's life as a Cherokee in the Tennessee mountains opens our eyes to many things, not the least of which is how tough life can be. Robbed of his parents at a very young age, he rebounds through the love of his grandparents. Keep the kleenexes handy, you will shed a tear at some of his trials. Great acting all around and beautifully filmed."
4,Charming and Simple,"I loved the mountains in this movie. I don't know if it was filmed in the Appalacian mountains or somewhere else, but I want to go there. To have a grandma and grandpa so loving and spiritual would be such joy for any child. Little Tree has Indian blood in him from his grandma and White blood from his grandpa. His parents die and he lives with them in the mountains. They educate him with love and wisdom. The simplicity of truth. I felt awestruck by such simple honesty and the beauty of nature. It seems Little Tree kept his grandparents with him throughout his life, holding him in his spirit as they held him within theirs. Looking at the Dog Star and knowing, really knowing that he could be heard. What a feeling of saftey. This movie weaves that safe warmth as you view it.Lisa Nary"
2,not good,"i would just like to say a few things about this toy:P i personally think that this thing is stupid. also when i tossed it up in the air the jet packs didnt actually make it fly so it fell and crashed! then it started on fire and my house burned down. it was just a life changing experience and i would like all my wonderfull followers to kno that this is a dangerous toy and that it is not a good purchase. thank yousincerely,|G-dogg"
2,WARNING!! WHOLE CARTOON NOT INCLUDED,"I recently purchased both vol 2& 3 of JCA on DVD. To my dismay, I discovered they did not include any of the preludes that set up the main story before they play the main title theme. The rest of the cartoon is the same, but it seems very abrupt to be thrown into the action with no set up. The proper order is prelude, main theme song, story. All of the preludes were not included. I'm going to return my copies back where I bought them."
5,Delightful early reader books,"My children received this set of books as a gift. My 4 year old son loves the simple, charming stories and activities. My 2 year old daughter loves the pictures."
3,Great background music...,Good to just have on in the background of whatever you're doing. Kinda something you would expect to hear in an independent coffee shop or holistic health food store.
1,Unnaceptable Sound Quality,"This fax/cordless phone combo has many outstanding features, unfortunately good cordless reception is not one of them. My phone often had heavy static regardless of which channel I was on. I subsequently found out that a friend of mine purchased the same phone and also experienced heavy static. I hate to return any electronic gadget with so many cool features, but this one was so bad, I had to take it back."
3,Very Basic,"This book covers all of the necessary skills in order to find your way in the wilderness. However, it does so in such a superficial way that you come away from the book wondering whether you will be able to perform any of the skills in the real world.This is a rather disconcerting feeling to take away from a book like this, since people are going to get lost in the wilderness and then not know what to do. Such a subject should be covered fully, or not at all.If you are new to reading maps and land navigation, then you need more than this book will give you. I suggest Sierra's guide to land navigation for a beginning. If you know what you are doing with map and compass, then this book won't give you any new information. It is small enough to stick in your pocket, but I can think of lots of things I'd rather carry for a week on my back (food...water...a good novel...)."
3,GOOD DENSE COVERAGE,"This book is a very full discussion of Christology and how we got here. It is not an easy read (and probably not for an ""armchair"" read), but it is a very good treatment of the subject in a helpful way to someone who wishes to struggle with it."
4,A WONDERFUL EFFORT,"If you want the slick production that you remember from the 1970s, look elsewhere. If you want a newer, hip and totally fresh version of JCS, this is the one. This is a little rough around the edges, but then again, that's its appeal."
5,Outstanding,"As a purist myself, I wasn't sure I'd like this, but these artists have managed to do something very difficult -- they have been true to the intentions of the original while making it fresh again and finally more relevent to a new generation. If Rice & Lloyd Webber were writing it today, it would sound like this. It is an exceptional album, and though it will never replace the original, it is just as valid and just as much fun. (And ""King Herod's Song"" actually sounds like it belongs in the show -- at last..!)"
5,i lost my origial copy of this cd,I have been looking for another one of these for a long time. I am glad to own it now.
4,"Well Done, Faithful to the Spirit of 1973","I enjoyed this version, some of the versions approach the intensity and spirituality of the classic 1973 soundtrack album. I hope this work of art continues to enjoy periodic revivals, it has a message for all."
3,"A mixed bag, but I like it","As you can tell form the reviews already here, this is a spotty recording. There are parts that flat-out work brilliantly-Amy Ray's performance as Jesus is excellent. I love how she handles ""Hosanna."" Emily Saliers does a great job as Mary Magdalene, especially on ""Everything's Alright.""Other tracks will leave you scratching your head. Dave Clair's drunken take on ""King Herod's Song"" just sounds sloppy. If I have an overall complaint, it's the mix-very muddy, with the vocals sometimes lost in the mix completely.If you're looking for Broadway show-stopper stuff: run screaming in the other direction. If you like folk/acoustic rock, have an open mind, and welcome new interpretations, go for it. There are gems on these discs. Just like in real life though, ya gotta dig for 'em.Scott"
1,"lame, lame, lame","This recording adds nothing to the original interpretation. In fact, the musicians have trouble with the changing time signatures, and can't even play all the guitar riffs properly (there are more than a FEW bum notes). Besides all of this, there is no *creative* addition to the concepts musically or ideologically in this interpretation. This is a safe statement; that is, in essence, a NON-statement. Blah. Stick with the original if you like JCS at all."
3,Great if you love the Indigo Girls.,"This truly sounds like a bunch of buds who love Jesus Christ Superstar got together and recorded their own version, with some 90's updates (including a rap of the title song, which is the worst part). The Indigo girls sound great, professional, as polished as they ever pull off, but the rest of the cast is pretty amateurish. I appreciate the enthusiasm, and it does make a nice change, but can't beat one of the cast recordings."
5,Jesus Amy...how cool is that?!?,"I'm a big musical fan and a big fan of the Indigo Girls. So this is a pretty great combination for me! I've seen Jesus Christ Superstar and heard various versions of the soundtrack and while this one may lack a little of the passion of some of the others, I still really like it and it is the version I like to listen to over any other. However, the reason to buy it is the novelty of having the Indigo Girls performing on some of the songs. You've got to love Amy as Jesus! I think more lesbians should play Jesus in this musical! ;-) If you are looking for a really solid JCS soundtrack and you're not a big Indigo's fan, your best bet is probably the Broadway soundtrack. But if you love the Indigo Girls, you really need to own this CD!"
2,I'll sit this one out,"A boozy two a.m splice of real audio capture and I realise that I just wanna listen to the very beautiful and moving Love Will Come to You.I was getting lots of huge fright wigs and feedback from these samples, maybe this is me sitting in the outer circle when it comes to musicals and religion.I will get back to you on this one.B"
1,Why ruin something that is already perfect?,"Well, I am realltyglad I got to hear these samples. I am an Andrew Lloyd Webber fan since my early teens. I am just grateful that this was not the first version I heard of Jesus Christ Superstar. The musicians sound like kids who just got their first guitar for Christmas. The singers could use a few voice lessons... Why do we all think that older musicals need renewal? Yes, there is room for improvement on some of the songs but when here we have singers who think they can make it better when actually they give it a worse treatment, they are wasting our time. Listen to the latest verion on DVD or VHS and you can see and hear what real music should sound like. Once again, I am glad that I did not buy this recording. I am a collector of all of Webber's music and have never heard anything so poor. Even his first low-budget recordings were of better quality and integrety than this joke."
1,TERRIBLE!,"i thought this was the most terrible, horrible version of JCS i have ever heard! i cant believe they where even aloud to make this awful thing. i dont think it even deserves that whole one star i gave it... but i had to give it some sort of star..."
2,The Resurrection that Killed it for Me,"I'm as tolerant as the next person, but to have Jesus Christ played by a woman is just too much for me. You can have a woman play any other role in this musical (like Judas or King Herod), but not the Son of God. It's too weird.The music itself is nice, it's not too heavy on bass or electric guitar, plus the use of a xylophone is a lovely bonus. But they also destroyed one of the greatest songs on the album, Superstar, by turning it into some sort of rap by Social Insanity.If you like the woman playing Christ (I believe it's Amy Ray), if you like compilations and remixes, or if you've ever recorded your own karaoke, you'll probably enjoy this.But everyone else should avoid it. It leaves a bitter taste."
3,Jesus Christ Superstar is NOT a Resurrection!!,"I was shocked in every way when I first heard this recording!Such a horrible cast and Andrew Llyod Webber's music of the show lost its tune! In this recording, the director of the show wanted to make it more rock and roll but instead it was junk. Most of the cast were out of tune with the music causing confusion on how it was meant to sound. If you do buy this recording you might get upset but hey, I told you so!"
3,quick shipping,"I needed it before Christmas and it came just in time. Thanks!!!! The product = its a good mouse pad, but no wrist rest."
5,An incredible journey back in time.,"Tony Reynolds' Full Circle transports you back to the time when life was sweet and memories even sweeter. His crisp, clear voice transcends the music, whether it be a beautiful ballad, which is his forte, or a swing song like ""Flip, Flop and Fly"". If you were lucky enough to be around in the Fifties, it will revive your fondest memories. If not, it will bring you to a place in time you will come to love. I play it daily and it never ceases to amaze me how good a mood it creates. BRAVO!! Bring on another CD soon, Tony Reynolds!!!!!"
3,FULL CIRCLE..A MUSICAL LEGACY,"I am a little dissapointed with this cd...some good songs, but some arent so good. It arrived in time and in great condition, just not real thrilled with the songs."
4,A great sourcebook,"The Association of Contemplative Sisters is a group of both nuns and laywomen, who know and care about spiritual life. Some of their members have carefully researched resources for those of us who share their desire for prayer and for companionship on the contemplative way. This book contains articles about various aspects of being a person of prayer outside any monastery. But the greatest contribution, I think, is the long section of information on a variety of organizations and places where one can make retreats, find information, or join with others who share the lay contemplative life.It is a readable, informative book. You will feel you know the writers personally!review by Janet Knori, author of Awakening in God"
3,disappointed by d-link,"The card is good but the router is of bad quality. In daily use I have to restart the router irregularly to make it work.Moreover, the rebate didn't go through and I had to resubmit the same supporting documents to request rebate check."
5,Fair price nicer performance,"This is a fair priced equipment, nice for homes and regular internet activity, work's best with windows xp, i took it out of the box follow the easy instructions and had it working properly withing 45 minutes, be shure to know what expecific plan you're isp gives you to properly configure the router."
3,does the job,"well i bought this kit today. how ever the kit that i bought today uses different firmware then the 1.1 or the 1.3 that most of the reviews mention. the one kit i have has a revised firmware packers of 300 or 301 firmware, it came with the 300 packet installed and my connections kept dropping, but after upgrading to the newer 301 firmware, it hasnt droped yet and both pc's and my laptop are connected with out any issues.but i can tell you this, if it starts to act up i will go with a different brand, since i havent heard much good about d-link. but for 20 bucks after rebate at bb you cant go wrong."
1,Scares cats!,"This item scared my cat so much she took off running every time I got near her with it. The reason is that, although it claims to be silent, it makes a faint, high-pitched whine that cats can definitely hear. Dogs might not mind, but my cat wouldn't sit still for it, and I'll bet yours won't either. I wasted 10 bucks on this useless item."
1,The worst brush ever,Do not buy this product! The handle comes apart while you use the brush and it is not effective. Waste of money!!!
1,Machismo is alive and well,"Can't Mark Jenkins and his buddies work out their testosterone-driven adventure needs without exploiting another culture in the process? Stick to Laramie, Wyoming, Mr. Jenkins. You're giving Americans a bad name."
5,Great Workout,"This workout is great if you want to lose weight on your abs, I highly recommed this workout."
1,don't buy this lock ! PLEASE READ,"As previous posters I thought this lock was close to indestructible- at least with conventional bolt cutters. I was dead wrong. My scooter was stolen and they had what seems to be the biggest bold cutters that you can find available to the general public (not construction grade).In addition to the fact that the chain was cut like butter with these bolt cutters, the ""limited anti-theft program offer"" is not honored by the OnGuard company. The broken link was left at the scene, the lock was registered, the paper work was filed out accurately within the ""15 days of purchase"" window, and all other conditions were met (ie fine print). OnGuard is now rescinding their warranty!!!If you have a scooter, or a high value bike- PLEASE think twice before purchasing this lock!!(I am still fighting this, and if it changes, will update this post)Warranty info: [...]"
1,Lies,So I received my chain lock and found that the chain has square links instead of the hexagonal shown in the photo and on the Onguard site. The Onguard material attached to the chain lock also states that this is supposed to be a hexagonal link. I then measured the links to find that they are 8 mm across rather than the 10 mm from the attached material and the Onguard site. The u-lock at the bottom is stamped 5019LP and attached material does have a valid barcode and UPC. Either Onguard made this with the wrong chain or someone changed the chain before it was sent out. Either way I am beyond disappointed.
5,Best 72nd scale WWII USN Fighter. Period.,"Tamiya 1/72 Vought F4U-1 Bird Cage Corsair1/72 Vought F4U-1A CorsairI have finished one of these models (built up as a Brewster F3A-1), i have one in painting, one almost ready for painting, one almost ready for wing mate, and two in the cockpit painting phase. Kit strikes an excellent balance between detail, fit, and ease of construction. Only other 72nd scale subject that comes close in quality is the Academy SB2C Helldiver.At 12.66 this kit represents an excellent value, particularly considering its original retail price. Even at 16.85, the F4U-1 and F4U-1A represent excellent value since they include extra parts you can use on other 72nd scale WWII USN subjects."
4,Very enjoyable listening experience,"First Contact is a blend of previous Goldsmith Star Trek scores combined with some nice cues, especially the First Contact theme. Track 10 is perhaps the most poignant track and combined with ""Red Alert"" and ""Temporal Wake"", this cd is a must have!"
4,Suspense Full,"Very well done. You can imagine what might be taking place in the scene, even though some parts can get a little boring."
5,"Haven't actually heard the CD, but have seen the movie","If the music on the cd is anything like the music from the movie, than I give it two thumbs up."
2,Mixed feelings about enhanced CD content,"We ran it on a PC. It installed some nasty Win3.x AOL software; the front end was nice when it didn't crash.The Quicktime movie interviews were adequately brilliant, but there were no movie clips or trailers. On the whole, I preferred having an Enhanced CD to a vanilla one -- just."
2,good soundtrack,"Nice soundtrack and worth buying. I will say that Jerry Goldsmith is NOT the best composer of all time. Good music but i thought it could have been, just like the movie, alot better."
4,Good Soundtrack for a good movie,"I love Star Trek, and the music complements the movie very well I think. They pull the music from the original boring movie and instead of it's being Klingon music its now Worf's battle music. The opening credit music is very pretty and fitting. I think that this fits well with the movie, and what more can I say about a soundtrack? :) buy it if you like soundtracks, and star trek, if not then don't!"
4,Most Excellent - Recommended,"If you even have an inkling of affinity for Star Trek, I believe you'll like this soundtrack. I especially love the main title; it is very moving and powerful. I like that in movies, composers are able to develop musical themes far better than in a short TV episode. The Borg theme is absolutely perfect. The main title recurrs throughout the film. You notice it most when Picard shows Lily that she is in space, and then also when Cochrane greets the Vulcans. As others have mentioned, the Klingon theme is also brought back during battle, which I think is really great. All in all, I'd say this is a good buy."
4,Appropriate score for the movie,"Star Trek Generations is a much more tuneful soundtrack. The ""mechanical-themed"" First Contact evokes strong images of our Borg buddies. Nicely recorded!"
1,only received 9 bags,"Only received 9 bags, instead of 36. Amazon offered a refund or 20% off... why would I pay 80% if I only received 25% of the product? So back they went.They did look like nice bags, unfortunately I did not get a chance to use them."
1,Only 3 arrived,"Only 3 bags were shipped. Amazon requires that you return the product and re-order the 36 bags. This seems a little crazy to me - I'm supposed to order the same product again and just hope that the order will turn out right this time? Amazon, oh Amazon, why can't you give me some decent customer service and send the other 33 bags? For me, the savings here isn't worth the extra time & trouble."
1,Another one took a beating,"I saw in other reviews not to order from Killdirt as they were only shipping 9 bags so I chose a different seller. Did not make a difference, still only got 9 bags. Called customer service for Amazon and they wanted me to send the bags back and get a refund. I told them that I had already opened the bags and used them so they said they would send me another shipment and when I got the 36 bags I could just send 9 back. I got the new shipment and again it was only 9 bags. I called customer service again and they said to send all the bags back and they would give me a refund. When I got their email it was saying I had to pay shipping. I don't know why I was expected to pay shipping as it was certainly not my mistake. I ended up just keeping the 18 bags and calling it good."
5,Lynsay Sands Does It Again,"Bliss is another mad romp through an era that one doesn't traditionally think of as amusing. But, as always, Lynsay manages to find the humor and supply the high jinx for a battle of the sexes. A couple other books that I loved in this same vein are THE KEY and ALWAYS. They were all super."
1,Boring to the nth degree,"The story line is predictable. Hate to love in a few days. What makes this particular story different is the ridiculous lengths the ""heronine"" goes to to prevent the marriage. I was bored silly by page 100 and fast forwarded after that. The Lady Holden was annoying and the Lord Holden was a wimp. Not too terribly difficult to determine the villain either."
5,"""Bliss"" fully outrageous","Lynsay Sands has never failed to entertain and amuse. ""Bliss"" is no exception to that rule. Her unique form of humor will keep any reader chuckling and turning pages into the wee hours of the morning. Now, if you are a stickler for historical accuracy, you may have a problem with modern medical terms being used in medieval England. However, I consider this poetic license and it only added to the enjoyment of the book. The antics in this book were refreshing, quick-witted, and a pure pleasure. If you don't enjoy this book thoroughly; you do not have a funny bone."
4,Excuse me while I laugh...........,"The poor hero is stuck with a lady he considers the nag of all nags. The heroine is stuck with ""The Hammer"", a man she knows to be unspeakably cruel and brutal.To what lengths would you go to avoid an arranged marriage....Ms. Sands made a story that could be so yawningly typical, into a spitfire comedy of love. Terrific writing, likable characters and predicaments that you gotta see to believe. Throw in some delicious romance (and the poor hero that you've got feel sorry for-in a funny way), and you've got a book that I read practically in one sitting. Hang your ""Do Not Disturb"" sign, ladies........."
3,Basically like every other Lynsay Sands book,"I like Lynsay Sands, but if you've read one of her books, you've basically read them all. They all follow the same formula with the couple reluctant to marry at first, then they get used to each other and start falling in love, then someone threatens the life of one or both of them. It usually isn't that hard figuring out who that someone is either.There are a few funny parts as Sands seems to favor slapstick humor. Still, I found myself being bored with this book. Not that the book is badly written, it just felt like deja vu. If I hadn't already read The Deed, What She Wants, Sweet Temptation, The Perfect Wife, and other Sands historicals, I probably would've enjoyed this one more."
2,A little unnerving...,"If you enjoy Lynsay Sands, you will like this book. The story is fast-paced and, for the most part, fun. What bothered me, however, was the ""gross"" factor. It's hard to accept two people falling in love being that blantantly cruel to each other.If you're looking for a great Sands historical, I'd go with the triology The Key, The Deed, and The Chase. They are, by far, the best of her work."
2,No good.,"Bought this item to vaporize plant materials. It doesn't work. It does not get hot enough. Buy the Makita version instead. It is way more money, but works great. Gotta go it's 420...somewhere."
4,A good watch,"This is a nice watch that does what it is supposed to do. It looks good on your wrist and has nice color. I don't know if I am just used to it from many of my other warches or if its this watches fault. The face looks small to me. That is all that's wrong, color of face is a nice light gold and the band sparkles brilliantly. The pattern on the face looks rich, the name of the brand stands out without being to much and I always liked the Bulova emblem. Day and date are easy to read (which some other name brand watches have failed to provide). I am pleased with this watch."
4,Dressy Gold-Tone,"There is no question that Bulova has really made some classy and contemporary watches over the years. They have had some styles that haven't been as classy and brilliant in their leather-strapped pieces, but their gold-tone watches have definitely hit the nail on the head. This Bulova Men's Bracelet watch stands out as a great calendar piece that is easy to setup, and works brilliantly in a quartz movement. I like this piece because it stands out well, where most of the other gold-toned watches Bulova has had don't really have a day and date setting that is easy to maintain. I definitely recommend Bulova watches, because they really standby their watches, and deliver mostly each and every time.Price: B+Setup & Comfort: B 1/2+Overall: B 1/2+"
5,You will hear this again and again...,"...but this is the best album of 2001. It's the most complete work I've come across, and shows some excellent growth if your familiar with Whiskeytown's Pneumonia, or last year's Heartbreaker. It is a significant departure from both, but in an outstanding way. Ryan Adams has made an album that is both new and familiar. It's not the same retread albums you hear on the radio, but rather the songs that you hear in the back of your head from childhood, when artists had to convey their message in disguised lyrics, rather than dropping and F-bomb every 5 seconds. On a song like Answering Bell, you'll think you're hearing Van Morrison. Others will conjur Robert Plant, or the Who. But that's the beauty of this album. Adams has taken everything that was once great in music, and built upon it. Everybody may not adore this album, but you won't be disappointed in it."
5,Best work since Whiskeytown,"I'm a long time listener (first time caller), of Ryan Adams and this album is the best one that i've heard in a long time. You can hear that talent and emotion that went into making this album and its great to see the progression in his music. If you're not familiar with Ryan's music then this album is an excellent way to get acquainted, and if you are familiar with him then I don't need to convince you that this album is fantastic."
3,"""Gold""? Um.....","Other than the complete ""Love Is Hell"" album which I find very consistent, this is your typical Ryan Adams album. Meaning half these songs ARE gold, and of course the others are just so-so. His first real hit ""New York, New York"" is here, and that's a great start to the album. I find the rest like ""Firecracker"", ""Gonna Make You Love Me"", and ""Nobody Girl"" to be good, and others like the last few should have simply been dropped. My overall favorite track is ""When The Stars Go Blue"", which is a primo Adams song if there ever was one (also covered by The Corrs and Bono). The bonus disc is a nice extra for the big fan, and I enjoy it, but not so essential to buy this twice for. In short a must for the fanatic, but I like ""Heartbreaker"" and ""Cold Roses"" better."
4,Let's play 'Spot the Influence',"RYAN ADAMS - GOLDThis album should have been titled ""Spot the Influence"". Here are the ones I picked up:VAN MORRISONSTONESNEIL YOUNGSTEPHEN STILLSELTON JOHNLED ZEPPELINPAUL WESTERBERGSTEVE FORBERTTHE BANDTHE WHOHUMBLE PIEBOB DYLANSTEVE WINWOODI am sure you can pick up others that I missed. My favorite track is Nobody Girl which reminded me of a cross between Traffic and Neil Young (of course). His band includes Chris ""son of Stephen"" Stills, Benmont Tench and Adam Duritz on some background vocals. I think the albums greatest strength is its many varied styles. Its greatest weakness is living up to the hype."
5,-,"i never thought i could love a cd so much in all my life. his music is creative, sexy, honest, thoughtful, unique...this is an excellent cd and even better than his first solo work. out of all of his solo albums (heartbreaker, gold, demolition, rock and roll and love is hell parts 1 & 2) i rate this as the best. those who have heard the corrs' cheap rip off of 'where the stars go blue' will be surprised to hear the original version written by ryan adams. he shines on tracks 1, 4, 5, and 7. track 8 is the longest and best on the entire cd because it contains so many moods and styles. his creativity is astounding."
4,"September 10, 2001","The album was a work of art but you need to see the video For I still love you New York It was shot on September 10, 2001 on the other side of the Hudson with the WTC in the backround!! Bone Chilling yet refreshing! He was the first musical guest on SNL after the attacks . Enjoy"
5,Wow!!,"This is the first Ryan Adams album I have ever bought. I bought it because I am a hugh Counting Crows fan and Adam Duritz not only plugged this album during recent concerts; but also sings on ""Rosalie Come and Go"". All I can say is WOW!!!! The lyrics are wonderful. When a song makes me examine my own emotions and actions, I know it is a keeper. There are too many on this album that do that to even count. The music is absolutely beautiful. Don't let the fact that Ryan and Whiskeytown have been classified as Country Rock. I think this album transcends into all types of musical genre. This will not be the last Ryan Adams/Whiskeytown album I ever buy. I can't wait to sample more Ryan Adams."
3,He's got the chops....,"Ryan Adams certainly thinks he has a lot to say. To the credit of ""Gold,"" which I bought after seeing him perform ""New York, New York"" on some TV show, there are some brilliant moments of songwriting here. ""Firecracker"" also sounded like I was on the brink of listening to a five star album. But then the songs became meandering, unfocused (like ""Sylvia Plath"" or ""Wildflowers""). His attempts at ""rock"" are thoroughly unconvincing. The Stones should sue over ""Tina Toledo,"" and ""Enemy Fire"" is just a drudge.Like far too many young artists of the CD era, Ryan has yet to learn that your album doesn't have to squeeze into every minute of a disc's capacity. If he can figure out the benefits of self-restraint, Ryan Adams may still pull a brilliant solo effort out of his bag of tricks."
2,Disappointing,"I was really looking foward to listening to this cd, given the hype surrounding it. It starts out on a fantastic note with ""New York, New York"", but falls quickly thereafter. The various music styles just don't seem to mesh, giving the cd a ""choppy"" feel.Adams is, however, a talented songwriter, and I'm looking forward to future work from him."
3,Someone get this kid an editor!,"The first five tracks on this album (""New York"" through ""Rescue Blues"") are brilliant; in fact, when I played the CD for the first time, I started to get that ""Oh My God"" feeling that every music junkie gets when they're hearing something truly exceptional for the first time. Unfortunately, the buzz didn't last as the remaining 16 (!) average-to-damn-near-embarrassing (""Enemy Fire"" and ""Sylvia Plath"" have to be two of the worst songs I've ever heard in my life) songs played themselves out. I can't recall the last time I've heard such a lopsided record -- or one that failed so completely to fulfill its initial promise. Buyer beware...."
3,Gold,"I found only one good song. It was from a movie sound track ,other wise it is not worth buying."
3,okay album,"album was just ""okay."" La Cienega just smiled"" is by far the best song on the album. in fact it's a gem! a few other cuts are pretty good, but that's about it."
2,Strange brew,"I recently picked this up and found it to be overly clever and a clear disappointment. The signs are there...the '79' on the shirt (I get it...it's been a long time since the ""Summer of '69"" - one of his songs I connect with the most). But ohh, what a down turn in his career. Where is his old style of singing, the way he phrased a song, and where is the pop I love sooo much? Come back, please, give us more songs like the one above. Don't try to be soooo clever, and all will be forgiven."
1,Negatory!,"This lame careerist yuppie rock must have uncle tupelo rolling in his grave. Each track is an ingenuine nugget wrapped in some twangy schitck about being a hip gen-Xer livin in the 90s. And that sh--y song thats getting played on the t.v. is not only a shameless marketing ploy to cash in on tragedy, but also a direct rip from that ""Life is a highway I wanna ride it all night long."" song. I'd like to see Jeff Tweedy take Adams'""weathered"" guitar and smash it."
2,Behind Enemy Lines?,"It is not unlikely that a person who purchases this album does so because apparently it is no longer available the soundtrack of the movie ""Behind Enemy Lines"" starring Gene Hackman, a movie that has a terrific soundtrack.On newsgroups can be learned that one of those songs, the one at the end of the movie, would have been Ryan Adam's ""The Rescue Blues"".Be careful: if you arrived to this cd with that intention in mind and that Rock in mind, the track in this album titled ""the Rescue Blue"" might not be what you assumed or hoped for. If you have in mind that terrific music at the end of the movie, and if on newsgroups you are being told it is this one, well, simply: that movie song you are thinking of is not the one listed here as ""the Rescue Blues"". Simply.Aside from that as long as you like Ryan Adams, the cd can be good, but if (I said if) you want to buy this cd hoping to find that song from that movie soundtrack, you'd waste (not too much though) money, that is."
1,Dying for the Flag,"We have men dying for their country and ryan adams turns the flag upside down. One more of the useless socialist elite. When clinton was bombing Serbia for 80 days straight, where were the elite complaining about the ""evil America"" then. The silence was deafening!"
2,Hyped beyond reason unoriginal Adams,"This is not a bad record it just isn't that good.It comes across as an Alt country by numbers record without the touching (if a little hackneyed) songs that made Adams's name on ""heartbreaker"".Even the title ""Gold "" is hardly inpired?You'd be better off with a Wilco or early 1970's late 60's Rolling Stones record from which he has taken so much and made so little.It is interesting to note that the record was produced by Ethan Johns, the son of sometime Stones producer Glynn Johns and features Chris Stills son of etc..I think this kind of thinking is what holds Adams back as he has an obvious talent."
2,What's all the fuss bout???,I bought this because everywhere you go people are raving about the 2nd coming of Gram Parsons. I am not a convert. To be fair I have not listened to Heartbreaker or anything from Whiskeytown but this CD is marginal at best. There are 3 or 4 good songs here and 3 more mediocre ones. After that is a lot of filler. The big burning question is can this guy even sing? He is repeatedly mumbling words and his singing is questionable in my opinion. I actually thought a couple of songs were in a different language.
3,the brass ring,"Ryan Adams probably isn't going to start writing bad songs anytime soon, but it's hard not to see this collection as something of a stab at commercial viability. No shame in that, really -- the guy should do whatever he wants. But it does take some of the edge off the raw, underproduced character that had previously defined his work. And some folks will have trouble with that.That said, Adams is still one of the best of the -- let me use the cliche here that he doesn't always fit -- ""alt-country"" artists out there. The only problem with ""Gold"" might only be that it's not ""Heartbreaker"" or ""Pneumonia"". While it might suffer from those lofty comparisons, it's still pretty darn good. And it's another step in the evolution of a wonderful young songwriter that has been (and I suspect will continue to be) very rewarding to watch."
4,It's Gold Baby!,"Loved it. The guy has a pseudo alternative rock-country style that I like. First two tracks and track six are my favorites. Lyrics are cool. It's a classic ""guy singing and banging on guitar"" collection - you can't beat it."
4,"Not so well known, but a decent songwriter.","Ryan Adams has some solid songs on this CD. His style is similar to Shawn Mullins, if you're unfamiliar."
4,wonderful sophomore cd...,"keeping up with ryan adams is hard enough these days (see whiskeytown's delayed release, try to find the esquires, the pink hearts or various outher side projects...) however this cd was well worth the wait. gone are most of the production mistakes from his first solo cd but what remains with this cd are the outstanding lyrics and the beautiful music. let's hope he keeps up this pace and all of his stuff remains this good."
4,a hot 3 weeks,"Okay, so his borrowings are obvious to the point of parody... In fact his morphing vocals are pretty comical: suddenly developing a quavering upper register for his Neil Young-ish ""Wildflowers"", over-enunciating his way through the Stones knock-off ""Tina Toledo"", then skipping across the words of the Van-esque ""Answering Bell"". Count our blessings that there's no Ryan-does-Tom-Waits-does-Louis-Armstrong on ""Goodnight Hollywood Blvd"".And I also admit that this stuff is shallow as a petri dish, and it's just about passed its enjoy-by date in my household. But I can promise this disc will give you a hot 3 or 4 weeks, with no nasty side effects. Worth every penny."
3,...all hail Rock'n'Roll!,"This disc seems almost tailormade to alienate the alt.country faithful, and shed the baggage of his past. There are still a few Dylanisms at the start, but most of this is sort of introspective, folk-ish pop songcrafting. In vocal timbre he reminds me a lot of Loudon Wainwright III (or, by extension, Loudon's son, Rufus Wainwright...) On occasion he overplays his knowledge of the pop past: ""Tina Toledo's Street Walkin' Blues,"" for example, is just way too ""Sticky Fingers,"" and the baldness of the swipe is distracting. (Besides, hipsters writing about hookers -- yawn.) Overall though, this is a good album, nicely sculpted and quite listenable, though only tangentially ""country"". I suspect that although his alt.country fans were put off by this, that the record's cachet will grow as time goes by. I'm not wild about this, but it's certainly worth checking out."
3,What's all the fuss about?,"What a disappointment! A thoroughly average album with few memorable moments. The one word that best describes this album -- soulless. This album sounds decent enough, but it didn't make me feel a thing. Maybe I am just missing the boat. Plus, a lot of the songs are so soft (I swear they could easily have been on a Celine Dion record), leaving the realm of alt-country way behind, skipping right over pop, and landing squarely in schmaltz territory. If you want to hear Ryan Adam's best stuff, pick up Whiskeytown's ""Stranger's Almanac"" instead, a truly great album."
5,Unexpected...........,"Like many, I bought this CD out of curiosity because of the reviews it received. I was not a big fan of it at first. But after giving it a chance and a few spins in the CD player, I came to one conclusion: very addictive. Adams grew on me very quickly. It is a CD full of emotion and soul. If you would enjoy a mix of Counting Crows meets Dylan meets Garth Brooks as Chris Gaines, buy this CD and let it grow on you. You won't be dissapointed........"
4,An Essential Album from 2001,"Ryan Adams truly comes alive with this album. The first track, New York, New York became famous in the aftermath of the 9/11 tragedy because of the prominence of the World Trade Center buildings in the video. However this track is a thoughtful piece about a lover who is not bitter about the city after going through a painful break-up. Other songs of note include Firecracker, a fast paced love song, Rescue Blues and Gonna Make You Love Me. Most of the songs are catchy with their crisp acoustic guitar and distinctive vocals of Adams."
3,"Great, could be greater","Try as I might to give Ryan a break, I can't help feeling he needs more quality control. He's like Prince in the mid-Eighties, brilliant but over-prolific, with no one brave enough to tell him that some of his tunes really aren't as good as they could/should be. I also don't like the deliberate ""I'm so sensitive"" Morrissey-like posing, or the way he namechecks US states all the time (or the whole country, on the sleeve) - it's a little manipulative for my tastes. Nevertheless, Ryan is one of the best new talents out there. I'd also recommend Eileen Rose - spectacularly good."
2,big disappointment,"As a huge fan of his previous record, ""Heartbreaker"", I found ""Gold"" to be a big disappointment. It seems as though Adams is trying to wow us with his prolific songwriting, but I think we would rather hear better songs than lots. The edgy excitement and soulful, raw emotion of ""Heartbreaker"" are not evident on this record. It sounds like too many music biz producers got together to make a homogenous, easily digested alt/pop record. Nothing new, exciting or interesting here. But it will probably sell well and get him on MTV, and it sounds like that's what he is after."
3,Boring and derivative,"There's nothing special here. Just fairly standard, mindless pop music. The next Bob Dylan? Hah. No comparison. Dylan is innovative, edgy and challenging, all things that Ryan Adams is not, at least on this album. Let's hope for better things in the future."
3,Peppy Pop,"This isn't Whiskeytown...its a bit more glamorous and obvious.Ryan Adams wears all of his influences, unashamed, on his sleeve.Give this disc a few listens before you write it off. Its certainly not his best or his most complete album (Heartbreaker, Strangers Almanac) and is more mainstream rock than anything he's ever done before."
3,SACD is a disappointment,"This SACD is a disappointment. The album is decent, but I was looking forward to hearing it in 5.1. This doesn't really sound any better then the original cd. After hearing Elton John's Yellow Brick Road in SACD, this SACD does not compare in sonic quality. By the way, I was never really an Elton John fan, but after listening to that excellent SACD release, it is obvious that Elton influenced Ryan Adams' lyrical style quite a bit. Anyway, stick with the original cd and save some money."
5,Sheer Gold,"I'll use this review to say things that no one else has pointed out yet. I was greeted with the New York, New York video on VH1 early one morning when I couldn't sleep. I took a minor chance on the album and bought it.....Since then, I have also bought Gold on vinyl just to get the second disc because I couldn't find it on CD... I don't even have a record player, but if I get one, it's just to play this album.One of the greatest songs ever is ""La Cienega Just Smiled""This is the album of all albums for the new millenium, a twist on old music, done by young artists. This album should be placed on a pedastol and all new rock albums compared to it.And to quote an old newspaper article that described a classic rock band's old live shows, ""Exaggeration? You cannot exaggerate perfection...""Need I say more?"
2,Disappointed,"I encourage all those who are interested in Adams (or have given up on him after this album) to check out the work he did previously with Whiskeytown- a lot more feeling and much better musicianship. He should never have given up on his country roots, in my opinion."
4,A good one.,"This man has some talent. I am a huge fan of Whiskeytown and also really love his solo work. My favourite songs are ""La Cienega Just Smiled"", ""When Stars Go Blue"" and ""Goodnight Hollywood Boulevard."" There is something amazingly heartfelt about his voice - the way it breaks at certain points. Lovely, in a kind of sad, poignant way. Not that the album is all blueness and misery ... And how 'bout his hair? Love it!"
3,good mellow CD,"I love New York, New York so I bought the album, but I don't think the rest of the album is nothing like NYNY, IMHO. There are definitely a few great songs, like Answering Bell and When the Stars Go Blue. It's a great mellow CD to listen at work or relaxing at home."
3,A Sprawling Piece,"Ryan Adams seems to be releasing a record every couple months. He might consider slowing down and weeding out his weaker material before releasing anything else. While Gold isn't a terrible record, it just doesn't produce many memorable moments. By the time the end of the record comes, what you once thought was a good song has been replicated 3 more times and you can't remember which version you liked more. Some of the songs on the album are terrible. The 9 minute ""Nobody Girl"" just keeps wandering back and forth going nowhere. Also the psuedo soul of ""Touch, Feel & Loose"" feels contrived and the soulless drums just accentuate the unnaturalness of the song."
1,Faithless Street Fan Left Disappointed,"Whiskeytown's Faithless Street introduced me to the amazing singer songwriter that was Ryan Adams. I wore out that album, taking in the aching harmonies, the fearless rockers, the liquor-dripping ballads -- I ate it up.Gold left me baffled. Where did Ryan Adams I knew go?I've done my best to let this album grow on me, but it just won't take. The Faithless Street spark isn't there, in my opinion. This album feels eerily calculated.Faithless Street fans looking to catch up with Mr. Adams should proceed with caution. His focus seems to have shifted a bit."
1,It's true!,"Ryan Adams is a minimally talented, pretentious, pompous twit with an ego as vast as San Fran Bay. There's no realy way to describe this album other than to say it's profoundly silly and creates in the listener the deep desire to destroy every acoustic guitar and coffee-house warbler from Norfolk, VA to Long beach, CA. Adams thinks he's making deep and significant Art; unfortunately, so do his deluded, oh-so-sensitive fans."
1,Ryan Adams is a Chameleon,"The Press may believe in Ryan Adams. I do not. He is just a good imitator and nothing more. I just wonder if all this hype is payola from his record label. It seems most of the record industry types are dying to have another marketable Neil Young or Gram Parsons. With the exception of his punk band the Patty Duke Syndrome, I have never heard anything original from him. They were a band that had some worthy ideas. Gold is contrived and so derivative it reeks of thievery. However, since he is playing music that is tried and true and radio friendly for the mindless masses to consume; perhaps he can become the major labels new marketable poster boy."
2,overrated,"Enormous hype got me to buy this CD. But there is little new here. Adams is largely recycling sounds of those who have come before him. If you want something from the country-rock section that has some freshness to it, pick up something by the Old 97's."
3,"Okay, but not up to the Hype","After all the press he got since leaving Whiskeytown, I really looked forwrad to the album. It's okay -- some really nice songs, and probably worth buying. But I have to admit I don't listen to it too much ... it just sort of meanders at times. And the first track (New York) starts out really catchy and then breaks into a really annoying Bruce Springsteen sax bit that I wish I could cut off. Overall okay."
2,Same ole...same ole...,"I don't get the hype surrounding Adams. If I wanted to listen to this kind of music, I'd pull out my old Bob Dylan, Rolling Stones, Black Crowes....and a dozen other white man blues/rockabilly/R&B albums. Nothing new here!"
5,Solid 4.5 stars,"I bought this the first day it came out, listened to it once, and was a tad disappointed because it wasn't as good as Heartbreaker. Now, over a month later that is the ONLY bad thing I can say about this record. I still like Heartbreaker better, but this is a very solid effort. My favorite tracks are The Rescue Blues and Nobody Girl, although the whole album is good. What makes this album special though (the first Sea and Cake CD is like this as well) is the fact that you can put this in at anytime and enjoy it. New York's CBGB stands for Country, Blue Grass, Blues, and ended up being a haven for punk rock. Ryan Adams is a punk who plays what CBGB was supposed to stand for."
2,Get his books instead,"While Douglas Brooks puts out some of the best books on resistance training (which I would highly recommend), this DVD is not a good example of his advice. In fact, there are several moves that are he says are ""contraindicated"" in his book that he includes on the DVD, which is rather dated (notice Brooks' mullet 'do!)"
1,Bad,"Bad, Bad, Bad.After watching this dvd, I realized that I had missed about half of it because I had fallen asleep."
2,Did not get what I ordered,"I ordered a red ibeatle headset Organizer in February 2009 and received a silver iBeatle. I promptly called and told them of the wrong color and was told that the red was out of stock and they would send one free of charge when they were back in stock.It is the end of June 2009, and my order has not been corrected, nor has there been any communications what the status is."
3,Nice idea but poor execution,"The plastic handle is limp as a noodle and the product is unpleasant to hold and awkward to use. The handle bends when you press the switch to turn on the light and the switch itself has a ""mushy"" feel and is hard to press all the way down until it makes contact. It is nice to have the light built-in, but the product could be better put together overall."
1,Such a shame,"Not much words have to be used. Season 1 was perfection, season 2 was nice. Season 3 got it's old feel back and was almost as great as 1, Season 4 was just between 2 and 3, not really good, but had it's fun moments. And then..... 5 years time.....The actors don't really seem to enjoy it, life has left the characters and not because they have changed over 5 years. It's all just flat, it's all uninspiring and after about 7 eps. I got so bored, I just struggled to get through the episodes. Part of me still is hoping Season 6 will be as good as it used to...But to be honest, I think Marc Cherry killed his characters early. Such a shame."
1,disappointed,I received my seasons of desperate housewives scratched and completely unusable. The discs would only work on my laptop due to the immense damage and I bought these apparently new...obviously not.
1,very defective mechandise,"I bought this item as a birthday gift for a friend who is a big fan. The disc was labeled ""brand new"" but it was so defective that it wouldn't play in his, mine, nor four other DVD players. Since it actually came from HOPELINE on Amazon marketplace, I don't know how to get the help I need replacing it because I still want to give the gift. Everything has gotten complicated when it should have been a no brainer."
1,Seller lied!,"Advertized as NEW... It wasn't... I paid extra because I thought it was new, contacted the seller and NO RESPONSE... Will never buy from again!! TradeEntrance is NOT professional. Be careful if you choose to ignore my review and buy from... They LIE."
3,Desperate Housewives,"I found that this season was not as enticing as the first four seasons, but with the slow build up in the begginning by the end of the season it turned out to be pretty decent. If you have the other seasons, then I would reccommend buying this one as well because it shows the growth of the characters and the difference with age with the ladies on Wysteria Lane. Wonder what they are going to do for the eye catcher in season 6?"
4,A Housewife's Addiction,Desperate Housewives: The Complete Fifth SeasonThis is definitely one of the best shows on tv right now. I love how they start the season out with a mystery and don't reveil the details until close to the end. Plus there is always a cliffhanger.
5,Still the best series around,"Another great season. I am highly disappointed, however, that my favorite character has been killed off. Edie was the most interesting character on the show. I am looking forward to season 6..keep up the great work!!"
4,"Started off strong, fell apart by the end.","Desperate Housewives - The Complete Fifth Season saw the show jumping 5 years ahead, I think it was a good change but by the end of the season, the storylines started getting ridiculous. I liked how Gaby lost her sex appeal and Carlos got his sight back. I didn't care for the whole Mike and Katherine new couple situation, they have no chemistry! Felicity Huffman is my favorite actress on this show but I didn't like how her character became so boring. I was very upset when Creator Marc Cherry killed off Edie played brilliantly by Nicolette Sheridan. The best episode of the season is the last one Sheridan is in, she was a force to be wrecken with, and she proved she could act - the show doesn't feel the same without her. I didn't care for the finale, Lynette is pregnant with twins again, c'mon!! Hopefully Season 6 will be the best year yet. 4 stars for Season 5."
4,Finally! They're back....,"Gotta love those desperate housewives! So glad that Season Six has finally started, it's time to snuggle in for the cold weather and some good tv!"
3,Entertaining but getting soapy,"Although Desperate Housewives is still a lot of fun, Season 5 is a bit disappointing compared to the previous seasons. It has become some kind of classy soap opera. Still beautifully filmed, with great actors and entertaining. Yet, there is no real mystery in this one that want you to watch the next episode right away. Some very good scenes, yet no climax such as the tornado in Season 4. Great for die-hard fans though."
4,Funny and entertaining,"I was wondering what the Fifth Series would be like, however it is funny and with the introduction of Evil Dave things become hilarious, yet thrillesque almost immediately."
1,WORST SEASON EVER,This was the WORST season of Desparate Housewives. They completely massacred the characters. They're all just so different from the characters we've grown to love.
4,Convenient,I thought it would be a little bigger but I can't complain. It's very soft and perfect for a kid.
4,Very entertaining,"This book should be required reading for all business majors and MBA students. Partnoy takes you inside some of the biggest brokerages on Wall Street and blows you away with the realities of trader mentality. I only wish I had read this book before I worked among the traders in my previous job as an auditor at a major investment bank. I can see now how naive I really was!My only criticism is that the explanation of the specific derivatives deals is WAY too detailed. Although, I'm not sure Partnoy could explain it any other way since derivatives ARE naturally extremely complex.... perhaps some endnotes with a few brief definitions? I found myself flipping back and forth towards the end to try and understand some of it. Just a thought for the next publication.But overall, it's a very well-written and easy to follow. Enjoy!I also HIGHLY recommend: ""Conspiracy of Fools: A True Story""by Kurt Eichenwald"
3,An average Wall Street tale sensationalized by anecdotes,This book was an average tale of Wall Street with some very entertaining quotes. It provides a good explanation of several complex structured products but loses credibility when hammering clients for the positions they took and the banks for the role the play in the financial markets.
3,Personal feelings dominate author's opinion,Investment banking is not for lightweights. I'm not sure Partnoy has the guts for the business and that permeates through the books. There is a strong bias that the bankers purposely take advantage of customers. Does that happen? Sure. But is it rampant as presented? Absolutely not. But it does sell books so a disgruntled employee goes for the gold.Derivatives are complex and many investors did not truly understand what they were buying. That doesn't mean all the sellers are criminals. I'd take a pass on this unless you want to increase your knowledge on these complex assets and read some mildly interesting stories.
4,Another take on the goings-on of Wall Street,"Frank Partnoy worked in Wall Street as a salesman, well selling things that he did not understand although he performed his job as though he understood. In this book he narrates his experiences, not only of the office activities but also some of the things that they did after work. This is an interesting book along the lines of similar books like: ""Liar's Poker"", ""When Genius Failed"" to mention just two."
4,Exaggerated but entertaining,"This book is somewhat exaggerated. A relatively entertaining story told by a former Wall Street salesman. The author has many funny accounts of wall street brutalities, abuse and the money culture. The author talks about the Orange County treasurer and how Morgan Stanley managed to make a lot of money from them, and eventually drive them to bankruptcy. It is very comparable to ""Liars Poker"" by M. Lewis.Fun light read."
4,"Entertaining read, oftentimes sensationalist","This book is an entertaining page turner, as we follow the author in his exploits and experiences in investment banking. However, as someone who knows a bit about the derivatives business, it is clear that the author tries to sensationalize the transactions, using the expression ""ripping someone's face off"" too often. Clients of investment banks are, for the most part, very experienced financial managers, who generally choose complex financial structures because these are the structures that exactly fit their needs. It is very rare (I have never seen it) that a customer would buy something he was not thoroughly familiar with. My only conclusion can be that the author was eager to write a book, and so chose every single transaction he was exposed to and created the image that customers were always innocent bystanders."
2,A hate letter from a writer to his ex-colleagues,"The writer clearly detests his Morgan Stanley ex-colleagues at a deeply personal level. The book is not only void of a single kind remark on any of them, but it also contains a number of surprising low-level shots. For example, by the end of the book we are given the extension number of the derivatives division at Morgan Stanley. What purpose can that serve? In fact, some of people that he does his best to portray in a most damaging manner, come through as normal though rather eccentric people operating under great stress. Finally, I felt that the writer has oversimplified derivatives beyond recognition. Yes, there is more to bonds than ""positive convexity is good""! On the other hand, I enjoyed reading the descriptions of certain derivatives products if only because such information is not available in the textbooks. All in all, my impression is that this was an attempt to write a second 'Liar's Poker', but the attempt is not successful."
4,Great Film,"This is a great film in that it takes on a never-ending issue of racism -done wonderfully by Wm Macy, Laura Dern and others. Arthur Miller's ideas were presented beautifully; bringing out self-searching feelings in all of us. Another example that a film can be great without car-chases, bombs, and the typical needless krap of Hollywood. It is what a film should be: plot, good acting, and the effect of deep thought both inside yourself and of the ""bigger picture"" in life."
2,Poor movie on a serious subject,"Let me first start with the obvious: antisemitism has been a serious problem throughout history, present in many societies and causing the deaths of million of Jews. That said, the problem with this movie is that it views the United States - probably the most welcoming society ever to Jews outside of Israel - as a not very different place from Nazi Germany. Set in 1943, the movie is about a Christian man (William H. Macy) who gets confused with a Jew after he starts wearing glasses!. A number of very nasty things happen to him after that (he loses his job and he is unable to find a new one, the neighbors won't talk to him, all ending up in a violent confrontation). From one of Arthur Miller's self pitying, patronizing novels, the sort that gave liberalism a bad name."
5,Very well made,Very well made - definitely better than I expected. Good welding and machining. Easy to assemble. Appears to have a very durable finish coating. This unit will easily hold a full complement of dumbbells.
4,Nuclear Newsreels,"These videos are a compilation of military films detailing our atomic bomb programs after World War Two. Some provide very good information on how energy is propogated and released from a nuclear bomb ignition and explains how the energy released seems apparantly greater than what scientists believed the bomb originally contained. What was actually happening was a confluence of shock waves that magnified the force of the bomb itself.Although the Cold War is over, we still see countries developing nukes. India and Pakistan developed them and our Intelligence Services exclaimed ""HOW THE *** DID THAT HAPPEN????"" well, now we hear Iran is developing nuclear weapons.Or are they?Well, our fearful leaders say they are.These videos give a glimpse of our own nuclear history through our own historical materials and provide an insight into this chapter of American military history."
5,Duck and Cover,"See it up close and personal, atomic blasts that are horrific and the attempt to get humans to somehow survive the blast! Insane!"
1,Poor sound & short playlist.,"The song selection is ok, but it only includes 10 tracks, clocking in at under 30 minutes. Also, the sound on this set is terrible. But that should be expected coming from some random import company, who only copy old 78's, cassettes, or previously released legitimate CD's. If you want a Bing Crosby Christmas CD, there are many to choose from that are produced by Decca/MCA (Crosby's recording company) that are in much better sound and include far more songs. Just type in ""Bing"", ""Christmas"" and ""Decca"" (or MCA), and you'll find plenty."
5,Scrubs is funny!,One of the best comedy series that was on TV. Long time/running series about the ups and downs (mostly down) antics at a large city teaching hospital. Good fun for all.
5,quality,"what can i say, i named my kittens after the characters on the show. If you haven't watched it, you should. Just don't watch the last season."
2,"Good Season, Bad DVD","This was a season which returned much closer to the quality of the earlier seasons but that is not what the review will cover.After 7 years of being aired 1.33:1 full frame while their brethren on NBC were upgraded to High-Def, scrubs finally began airing in 16:9 widescreen on ABC during it's Eighth season. If you picked up this DVD you wouldn't think that because the season is not in it's Original Aspect Ratio of 16:9, but once again in a dreary 1.33:1 full frame. This far into the lifespan of DVD there is NO EXCUSE for releasing a title outside of its OAR. It would appear this is some manner of underhanded ploy to force people to buy the Blu-ray in order to watch this season as intended, and I am very disappointed."
5,Going out with a bang!!!,"This is probably one of the most orighinal shows on television. I was immediately hooked on this show! However, far be it to say that this show is perfect. It hurts to say that this show has been going downhill, starting with season five. However, it is such a GREAT show that even with a few lackluster seasons, Scrubs is still one of the best shows on television. This season the show went back to it's roots, and it remind everyone why so many people did not want to let the series die. This is one of the best seasons, and possibly the last. And if that is the case, Mr. Lawrence you could not have ended it better.The Only 1"
4,"Fantastic Show, So-So Season","The last two seasons of Scrubs have clearly been plagued with bad luck, whether it's the Writer's Strike, network switching, actors' contracts ending, or just a lack of funding for an incredible cult television program. This season, unfortunately, was bad enough to make me stop watching for several weeks. It's far from the funniest season of Scrubs, which I'd say occured around Season 5, but a bad season of Scrubs is the eqivalent of a good season for most sitcoms out now. Scrubs is by far one of the more creatively funny shows out there and deserves way more recognition that it has recieved. If you're truly a fan of Scrubs, buy this season; although it's a lackluster season as a whole, a couple of the episodes (including the absolutely perfect finale) make it worth owning."
2,"Sad decline in a great, under rated series.","Scrubs was a great series, never got the respect it deserved. But this season just is sad. Not really funny or touching like it was. Even all the actors can't be bothered to show up for all the episodes.One note, may be me, season 8 wasn't really the final season, it was back for season 9, but they may have a point, not the same show with characters gone but name the same."
4,1st Scrubs set on BD...,"Viewed on a Panasonic 50"" plasma via a Panasonic DMP-BD80 through a Yamaha RX-V869 receiver (5.1 speakers) and an HDMI splitter/amp.PQ - not demo quality, but definitely for fans with an HDtv and a BD player. very close in quality to the original HD broadcast.AQ - unexceptional.extras - always a pleasure. the audio commentary for the Bahamas episodes (bill lawrence and christa miller) i found to be very amusing.technically, a 3 star/silver tier set, but for scrubs fans, this is definitely at least a 4 star buy."
5,Great Show!,"This is an excellent show and it never gets old. At this point you either like the show or you don't. So, if you like the show, buy the DVD. :-)"
1,Unwatchable DVD Aspect Ratio,"I have a Sony upconverting DVD player and Sony XBR LCD. The XBR has features which automatically adjust the display based on the signal coming in from the cable box, PC, DVD, etc. This works flawlessly on everything. Every DVD set I have, the PC, every cable TV program--everything, except Scrubs Season 8. Even when I disable the automatic features, this set still looks too wide--stretched.Bad aspect ratio drives me nuts--actually makes me ill--and I can't watch this set. I don't know what they did in transferring this season to DVD. Even 10 year old TV shows (West Wing, STNG, others) including all the older Scrubs box sets are fine.Either they messed up, or did it on purpose to get some other sale, but it's going back to Amazon tomorrow. Not satisfactory."
1,Sucked,"I always thought [Scrubs] was an awesome series, then I saw ""My Finale"".. By far the most cliche series ending ever -- ruined every once of crediblity this series had, and EVERY single episode before it. All of them."
1,NOT widescreen.,"This shows was finally filmed and broadcast in HD this year, in a widescreen format. I fully expected the DVD, like many similar shows, to be in a widescreen format as well.It's not. If you read the packaging carefully, it's tells you as much on the back of the DVD, as well as in the details on Amazon's site.DO NOT purchase this if you want to watch the show in it's original, HD format. Buy the Blu-ray set in the fall."
3,Zurdo,"This movie brings back memories when simple games like marbles was the only game my friends and I could because it was fun and we didn't have money to buy other toys. The film is a cute story and children will love it. I found the story to be lacking a strong plot. Yet, it is fantasy and fun for younger viewiers. I enjoyed the soundtrack by Paul Van Dyk much better...the movie doesn't have all the great tracks, but I liked it."
3,Inexpensive materials don't feel great,"You don't really have a lot of choices in casement window hardware nowadays; it all seems like cheapo pot metal ready to fall apart. This is about normal for the type of product. I haven't been able to find something that feels like it will last forever and work with the old windows. So don't expect a lot from this. I bought about 20 of them (L&R) to re-do our windows when the old painted cranks were just unturnable. It all works, but I sure don't feel like I renovated the windows for a long time. Oh well. I guess new windows is really the only way to get super high quality hardware nowadays."
2,Zero fluid resistance,"Was expecting something fluid resistant, for protection from blood in lab.This item is light and does from a contact barrier, however, it offers zero fluid protection.Sprayed myself using water from a spray bottle. Went right through and onto my shirt. Zero fluid resistance."
5,Same brand/quality that the hospital and nursing home used.,"I had to purchase these for the adult care home to use. They are thin but so are the ones that the hospital and nursing home used, They are for light fluid and bacteria barier only. My mother has Cdif so they have to use these to prevent spreading the disease.Price is great too considering the local company wants $1 ea! I couldn't find them for less anywhere else on the net either.5 Stars because they are good for what they are made for just be aware that they are NOT for all fluids etc."
5,Small gun packing a lot of heat,"I bought this gun on the the strength of overwhelming number of positive reviews here and I was not disappointed. I could not believe that such good heat gun can be had for such a small price. I use it for reflowing soldering on printed circuit boards and the adjustable heat works great there. Even in the low temp setting the heat comes up pretty fast. A temperature scale would be nice on the gun but that would probably make it more expensive. If measuring temp is so important to you, get an inexpensive multimeter that comes with temp probe and use that. Such independent measurement would be more reliable anyway. I have not tried to use the gun for paint peeling but I'm sure that in high setting the gun packs plenty of heat for such jobs as well.I was also impressed by the fast shipment of this heat gun. It can't get much better than this, folks."
4,"works, but not for me","This is a great heat gun that has many heat temperature settings and blows extremely hot air. I used this to fix my ps3, but did not work. So if your looking for a gun for typical needs, buy this gun, but do not buy this to fix your ps3."
5,Works great and easy to use,"I just got this Heat Gun a couple days ago. I wanted a device to smooth the tops of the wax in my container candles. I used a blow dryer in the past but it could get really messy if I put it on high for a faster melt. This heat gun was easy to use and got the job done quickly and efficiently. The heat setting worked well for me b/c I could select a hotter temperature and put it on a low setting, allowing the wax to quickly melt without tons of air blowing out, eliminating mess."
5,Works great!,I ordered this item to apply shrink wrap bands to my tattoo balm tins. The Grizzly heat gun works like a dream! I had tried using a regular hair dryer in the past with less than wonderful results. This tool works quickly and offers a variety of heat settings. You can play with the dial until you find the setting that is best for the task you are performing. Great value for the price.
4,Not bad at all.,"I bought this to try and fix my PS3 YLOD problem. Didn't work out but the gun did it's job quite well. It has a nice, sturdy body and was able to heat up very quickly. My only problem is that there is no real way of knowing EXACTLY how hot it is. With no dial or digital display to tell you the current heat setting, getting it at precisely 360 degrees celsius is a guessing game. So if ""Low"", ""Medium"", ""High"" and ""Superhigh"" isn't quite precise enough for you, you may want to look else where. If not, then its a great and affordable purchase."
5,"Lightweight, powerful and easy to use",I bought the Grizzly heat gun to shrink wrap some cds that I made. The first time I used it I noticed how light weight it was and how powerful. I only needed to use the lowest setting for it to get the job done. I love how it can stand on its own and how it has several settings. I have used it to shrink wrap over 800 cds and it still awesome. Good investment.
4,Good for the Price,"This heat gun has a few fairly annoying flaws, the most annoying of which is that the temperature control is a big dial at the back with no numbers, so you never actually know the precise or even rough temperature of the air. It's also larger and more cumbersome than any other heat gun I've used.BUT it is cheap, and it works for everything I've used it for. The problems are an inconvenience only."
2,returned it,"while this fondue set looks cool and very functional, the cheese and chocolate burn and stick to the bottom of the stainless steel pan, even with just a low flame. i returned mine after one use as it was too much effort to clean the pot afterwards...besides, with the amount of calories that go into fondues, i would have never used it often enough."
1,PLEASE DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE!,"The author wrote this book to make money and he did, but if his family is ever killed by a drunk driver he would hate himself forever. Please drive safe for the people you love."
3,"Cool, but somewhat cheaply made","We got this for my son for his birthday as a combined CD-player, alarm clock, analog-clock so he can learn time, pseudo-nightlight. The functions work well and it looks great, particularly the neon ring around the edge (which was actually so bright we couldn't use it as a night light).The negatives: the plastic parts are a little on the cheap side, and in particular we have had problem with the mode selector switching all by itself between ""off"" ""radio"" and ""CD"". We fiddled with it to make it stick a little better, but it still has to be adjusted every time the radio gets jostled."
4,"Far out, man... way far out","It is hard to say any thing bad about this book. This book is up-to-date and to the point, with many new discoveries and its accurate, giving dinos feathers and bright colors(if i must have an opinion, i like chapter three the most which contains my favorite family, Spinosauridae!). I justy think some of these ideas are just too plain far-fetched. Incuding1. Suchomimus being wholly aquatic2. Scipionyx being all females3. Psitticasaurus being poisinous4. Acrocanthasaurus having the sail developed by bacteria5. Eotyrannus eating Hypsys for algae that makes their heads bigP.S. I really love the sketches of Spino and the drawing of poor Suchomimus getting eaten by fictional Croc Chthonosuchus lethei"
3,"It's cute, but could be better","I got this for my ballerina's fourth birthday, and she liked it ok. She doesn't beg me to watch it. It might be better for a younger child. The music and presentation are geared toward younger kids. I'm also not sure my daughter really learned any dance moves, but I'm also not sure how well she payed attention. The filming is kind of bad, not that my little girl would care about that, but it is a little painful for me to watch (not that I really would). I think a one to three year old would enjoy this video very much."
1,Not a very worth while video. Would not recommend.,Ordered this video for grandaughter. Don't think she will ever get much out of it. Wouldn't order it again or recommend.
4,An Excellent Resource Tool and a Refreshing Read,"Any african-american who is interested in discovering what true wholistic living is all about should read this book. The author presents his findings in a well documented manner, and provides a much needed history of wholistic living from an african perspective. As far as I'm concerned, a must ""read"" for all and a must ""own"" if you are serious about any aspect of a wholistic lifestyle. Lookout Dr. Andrew Weil Dr. Imhotep Llaila Afrika is right beside you."
2,Interesting read....,"I first read this book back in 1993 when I found it in a library. The author recommended drinking 10 gallons of water a day! Yikes. Talking about drowning from within. It did have some interesting tidbits, but I would not take the recipes to much to heart if she's recommended 10 gallons of water."
5,GREAT BOOK,THIS BOOK IZ VERY INFORMATIVE FOR ANY PERSON INSTREDED IN HEALING THEIRSELF. DR. AFRIKA HAZ A WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE THAT SHOULD B SOAKED UP AND FOLLOWED. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND.
5,A wealth of knowledge.....,This book was recommended to me by a friend. Dr. Afrika is very deep. He has a serious wealth of knowledge on holistic health. This book is one of those book that you keep as like a reference in your personal collection~love it!
1,Pretty bad,"As others have said, this book is pretty horrible. It's written completely in a disorganized fashion, replete with errors, and full of commentary about the ""bi-polar psychosis that whites have to uphold their white supremacy"". What that has to do with holistic health, I have no idea. Oh, and healthy women are not supposed to menstruate, other than every 3 years - the ""solar"" cycle, not the ""lunar"" one (why wouldn't a solar cycle be a year?). And he goes on for a couple pages about the dangers of condoms, even though unprotected sex can be far more dangerous.I was disappointed. I'm sure that there is a lot of wisdom in African holistic health, but it won't be found in this book."
3,Good information,"Although the information was good, I was put off by the hostility and racism throughout the book. Otherwise, I would have given a higher rating."
3,Adhesive needs help!,Well the device works fine in the short run however in the long run eventually the adhesive gives way and the assembly comes tumbling down.
4,Delightful Little Snipets,"I was pretty shocked when I opened my box from Amazon and found such a tiny book that promised to tell what what life was like in all decades of this past century. However, once I started reading, I could not stop. When I compared what he wrote about the early years of the 1900's to the fifties, when I could first remember things, Allen's descriptions fit to a T, just what my mother and grandmother had told me. And when I got to the section where I was alive, I felt right at home. He is right on target with the words, phrases and ideas of the way we were. If you are expecting a detailed history of the last century, this is not the book for you. But what this little book does, is capture the essence of each decade concisely and cleverly. And then if you are really interested you can go on and seek out other books on the history of that particular era. I am going to keep mine and one day let grandchildren read it."
2,What if Felt Like Reading this book,"This is a concise history of the American Cultures exhibited in the 20th century. The author uses ten chapters, one for each decade. He displayed his liberal point of view and considered mostly the extreme radical happenings to paint his cultural pictures. It's not that his illustrations did not occur but lots of other moderate life styles were also progressing. He fails to even mention these. I have lived through most of the twentiety century and I did not see ""myself"" portrayed in any of these chapters. Maybe I did not ""live"" with his crowd. The author, a feature writer and editor for the Washington Post, uses a telegraphic type of prose which sometimes becomes annoying. Generally speaking, I did not enjoy the book. It was not what I expected."
2,Great idea but not executed well,"A superficial look at a century of decades of American life, in which the author does not effectively manage to project beyond his own viewpoint. What was it like for a woman to vote for the first time? Don't look in this book to learn that, this major historical event is not even mentioned. Instead for the twenties we have a chapter about a silly drunken flapper; it was hard to imagine a woman like that ever drew a single breath of life. In fact, the one dimensional stereotyped portraits in nearly all the chapters was difficult for me to get past, as was the absence of hope and strength of character."
3,Light and Superficial,"I heard this book discussed on National Public Radio and decided right away I had to buy it. Reading it, I came away disappointed. The book has a depth of material appropriate for radio discussion -- which, in book form, is appropriate for the dentist's waiting room or the bathroom. The chapters on the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s are mostly rehashes of stock commentary our society is already awash in. The chapters on earlier decades were more interesting, providing information about times that aren't so well documented by the modern media, but even they were pretty thin. Read this book next time you're waiting for an airplane, when you want to keep your mind busy but not so engrossed that you miss your boarding call."
4,Finely observed but....,"A fascinating gathering of some of the trivial details thatreally DO describe what it felt like (or must have felt like). Thismay have been unintentional but, taking a decade at a time, the book""feels"" rather depressing or, to put it another way, sincethe 1940s, its been mostly downhill. Judging by the book's size and... pricetag one might conclude the defining event of the 20th centurywas inflation. END"
1,A book about America by someone who seems to hate Americans,"I enjoy reading American history and was very excited about this book. It's an easy read - you can get through the entire thing in an evening. It's organized into a chapter per decade. The author appears to hate every single decade. The commentary is snide, with little underhanded digs here and there. With each decade, life appears to get worse and worse. Why would anyone want to read that? From the title of the book, I expected some documentation of people's feelings of what each decade really felt like, as reported by an unbiased outsider. That is not what this book is."
3,"Great music, poor recording","I love the music on this CD; however, there is a problem with the recording. The first 4 or 5 tracks are fine, but there is some sort of static in the remaining tracks. I thought first it was a problem with my MP3 player, but if you preview the tracks, you will notice it. It is a shame, because I would give it 5 stars otherwise."
2,Way Overpriced,Why does this item cost so much here? Talk about overpriced. Why is it not sold by amazon? I seen this car at a store for around $4.00. I think letting these types of sellers sell on this site will be amazon's downfall.
2,Don't buy this here!!,"I can't believe that this merchant is selling this for over $44!!! Don't be ripped off!Yes, these are high quality toys, and yes, my 3 year old who loves Cars loves these toys. I've spent the better part of the past 2 weeks hunting these down at my local Targets, Wal-Marts, K-Marts, etc. I've managed to find almost all at the normal price of $3.25 except Chick Hicks, and I was able to snag him for $9.50 on eBay.I gave this item 2 stars because it's a good toy, but it didn't get more because this is a crazy rip off price. You can easily find this elsewhere online for much, much less."
3,Cars Are Great - This price is awful,"I think these Disney Cars are awesome - my kids love them and they have alot of detail. However I think paying $44 is outrageous - for a matchbox sized car. I have been buying these since early fall, a couple at a time. Everytime I go to Walmart I always check the toy isle and get a few more as they show up. I just got the last two that I needed - Lizzie and Chick for only $4.00 a piece. Shame on these merchants for selling these at such high prices and taking advantage of our kids wants."
1,Talk About Price Gouging!,"I am amazed that Amazon would allow this type of price gouging on their site. I have gotten this car for $3.67 at my local Wal-Mart -- ridiculous that someone is out to financially rape someone, especially a children's toy! Shame on the seller -- I hope that Amazon cuts their ties with them as they are NOT a company with morals or integrity."
1,Way OVERPRICED!!!!!,This is a great toy and my almost 3 year old loves playing with it but I found his Chick at my local Wal-Mart for $3.44. They only had one at the time but when I was back yesterday they had enough one... just keep checking and don't buy it here!!! For all of us out there trying to get our kids all their favorite characters from Cars don't let this person rip you off or else they will just keep doing it!
1,Rip offs!!!,"I think that this price is absolutely ridiculous! People dont buy these items for that ridiculous price, they are $3.25 at Walmart and Target. These toys are hard to find at Walmart and Target, but its because these sellers are taking them off the shelfs to rip people off in these sites. If the demand is high they will continue to rip people off. Don't buy from these sellers, and you will begin to find them at your local stores!!!!!"
1,Don't get ripped off,I have found almost all of these cars for usually about $3.00. My son loves them but we haven't found all of them yet. I got lucky and have found some of the rare one's like Sarge at Longs. I usually take my son to the toy aisle of most of the stores we go to (which isn't all that often) just so he can look around. That is how I have found some of the rarer cars. I do hope they make more of these great cars so that every child can enjoy them. I say shop around a little and give it time you may be surprised what you find. I found Nitroaide at Mervyns. Happy Shopping.
1,Beware of HP & Compaq,"If you own an HP and/or Compaq (both owned by HP) beware. The chip will most likely not work. Merchant advised me to try a Kingston brand, jury is still out on that one."
4,H20 Pro styling Iron,"The h20pro styling iron works great. It really straigtens your hair. The styling iron arrived in a matter of a few days. It was in good condition. The only thing I notice about them is my hair seemed a little dry after straightening, expecially on the ends. Could be I need a trim. Other than that I really like the way they straighten my hair. I like the fact you can adjust the tempeture. I would recommend this product to a friend."
1,Downright depressing! Not my type.,"I REALLY GOT BORED AND DEPRESSED BY THIS ONE. YOU'D THINK THAT GIFF JACOBS JUST GETTING OUT OF THE SLAMMER AND HUNTING THE GUYS THAT FRAMED HIM SOUNDS GOOD. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE'S JUST SOME ELEMENT OF EXCITEMENT (NOT DANGER) MISSING FROM THE STORY. ALSO, THE LOVE HE AND ROXIE LOWELL FELT WAS REALLY PAINFUL."
5,Great Saint Movie!,"This is a great movie done on Saint Bernadette! The acting is good, and the movie gives you a great idea of who St. Bernadette really was. It doesn't attempt to portray her having a life of no sufferings, and the movie doesn't attempt to show Mary in Bernadette's visions-thus having cheesy ""vision scenes"". (It just shows Bernadette seeing the vision-not showing Mary though)WARNING: This is a wonderful, fully, authentic, and totally Catholic movie. Don't take my word for it, just see it yourself! You won't regret it!"
2,power station years,"this is for the hard core JBJ fan. It is an excellent way to complete your collection, though. Gosh, he sounds so young."
5,Powerpoint 2003 Step by Step,As a beginer I have been able to understand the information and directions in the book with out any problems. Sometimes training books are to detailed for me to understand. The book is not. I am very satified with the book.
5,Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003 Step by Step,"Fast shipping. Book rec'd in same great condition as described on website. All in all, an A+ transaction."
2,This should have been the manual,"This is certainly as dry as a computer manual, so Microsoft could have included this as at least a PDF with PowerPoint. So did not do that and now they want you to buy this separately. That itself is reason to not buy this book and look at other alternatives.My favorite others are:How To Do Everything with PowerPoint 2003Cutting Edge PowerPoint for DummiesPowerPoint 2003 Visual Quickstart Guide"
2,"Basic Windows Information, not just Basic Powerpoint","I'm fairly dissapointed by this book, as a lot of it is not just basic instruction for how to use Powerpoint, but also how to use any other Microsoft Office program. I got halfway through before I found anything that I didn't already know just from using Word and Excel. This book is for someone with practically NO knowledge of computers, period."
5,WINCHESTER COMMEMORATIVE RIFLES EACH DESCRIBED,"The Winchester Commemoratives, completely describes all the vital information about the Commemoratives, including a large color picture of each of the rifles. The details of the number manufactured; type of plating on the receiver, number of rifles produced; caliber; barrel length; number of cartriges; and a narrative of who or what is being commemorated. The narrative gives a two paragraph story about the importance of the subject. The book the the best guide for the purchase and owning of the beautiful Commemorative Rifles made by Winchester."
4,Comprehensive philosophy of wrestling,"This video emphasizes more than just repetition of practice moves, but rather what to do when you don't succeed. For me, this was very helpful to maintaining a winning philosophy. Coach Smith shows what you can do beyond the usual isolated techniques to instill a series or ""chain"" of moves as alternatives when what you first attempted (and this happens all the time) doesn't work. Very helpful for me. The only thing I didn't like about the video was the interspersed steel guitar music used to introduce each segment. They could have done without that entirely. It's just filler."
5,Ultimate curling reference book,"For the few books on curling that I have found, this has to be one of the most informative ever. Author Gidley writes in an easy to follow style that makes the sport interesting for the novice or expert."
3,O.K.,"It is not a good book for just curling in general beacause it focuses on Superior,MI's curling team and history. But it was O.K. for the info I wanted, but the book not what I was looking for."
1,What Not to Write,"I'm this novel's ideal demographic: I've lived in Austin for three decades; I love and hate the place; I have a degree from UT; and I'm certainly a card-carrying liberal, one who has even subscribed to The Nation (to which the author has contributed). But I loathed this book. Not because it wasn't true to ""my"" city, but because its author thought she had to write Art instead of telling a story. By page 90, I was wondering if the story would ever begin -- or if I'd ever find anything to admire in the person who, I surmised after many choppy chapters, was the main character. But there was nothing to admire or to even vaguely like in the struggling Austin Chronicle journalist who is the protagonist. I did make it to the end of the book, because of the odd moment of funny truthfulness or because some vivid detail was keenly rendered. For that, I give the novel one star."
2,Almost three stars-,"The second half of this novel was certainly better than the first. The author was at her best in scenes heavy in dialogue. The narrative tended to wander off laden with too much description that really added nothing to the story or the characters. I don't think the overall spirit and vibe of Austin came out although I could be mistaken since I have only visited the city and have never lived there. The writing got stronger as the story went on but over all I never saw much pint in the whole thing. I did find the characters interesting enough to keep reading. Not the greatest of novels, but certainly not the worst. The author had potential so I would be open to reading future works."
2,Mostly for Generations X & Y,"Waterloo is very well written, but is peopled by the most boring losers I have read about in years! Both the younger characters - in their early thirties - and the older ones - in their fifties and beyond - are self-absorbed and self-righteous. Hard to say which is more boring: their drinking bouts or their sexual exploits."
1,What a disappointment,"Ugly cover, lousy title...and the book itself! Bland, boring, unconvincing. There's nothing wrong with having characters who are slackers, but it might help to have the slackers be interesting or even a little nuts. Nothing is at stake in this book--for anybody. And Olsson apparently has no sense of humor--her charactrers are all very grim and very earnest, and she's very condescending not only the poor boring dopes that inhabit her book but to her readers as well. Very sad. And why use ""Waterloo"" for Austin--especially since the book jacket says ""Austin""? Stupid.The sound you hear is Billy Lee Brammer spinning in his grave...."
3,The RunningGirl,"This was the first time I have read a book with a religious theme. I found the book very interesting while also I felt that I gained some insight on how different people feel about their religion and how it shapes their lives. I found the part about Nero educational and interesting. This being Mr. Blankenships' first work of fiction, it was enjoyable and what I would consider a soft book, a book that kept your interest, but was not a real page turner. I would look forward to reading more from the author."
3,Great book to spark lively debate!,"From visions, miraculous healing, to demons personified, this book definately has it all! I must admit it got a little too much to take at times, but I couldn't put it down. It had enough intrigue that I HAD to keep reading. My favorite part was the final race - I felt it really started getting good there. Over all, a nice job for a 1st novel and I agree that this writer shows promise."
3,Run Out and get The Running Girl!!,"My Blankenship does a great job with spiritual warfare. The Christian message in the novel is unquestioned.Through a tale of every-day characters, sent on a mission from God, this book delivers page turning action, once the story gets going. The author takes a few chapters in the beginning to set the stae, which I thought moved a littel slow, but once the action starts, it takes you to the very end!I will recommend this book to anyone interested in spiritual warfare, and also to any younger reader. This book was only 160 pages and written so that any reader could easily enjoy it!I look forward to Mr. Blankenships next piece!!"
4,Exciting!,"With his first novel, Dan Blankenship shows he has a real gift for writing. The Running Girl is suspenseful and exciting! The classic tale of good versus evil. The characters are well written into the author's vivid imagination. This book shows a positive family situation with a good message and I would classify this book as Christian reading. There are a lot of religious beliefs and ideas that may not be shared by all readers. I look forward to reading more suspense writing in the mainstream from this author."
5,What a GREAT novel! =),"I think this book deserves 5 Stars for the amazing story that unfolds! The setting is in a real life Midwestern town, that most can relate to.The events that unfold are full of suspense and excitement!!!Definately 2 THUMBS UP!!!~Lora =^..^=NW Indiana"
4,edge of your seat page turner,Superbly written account of good versus evil. The characters are like what you want your friends and neighbors to be like. I could picture Keanu or Denzel portraying Reese Mantle. It would be a great movie!
4,The Running Girl,"I never really liked reading books,but this one opened my eyes to a new world of reading.When Dan Blankenship first talked to me about his book I didn't think much of it, and to be totally honest I wasn't going to read it,but I did and it was the best.This book inspires me to read more and get people to enjoy reading.This book was the boom-digity!!!!"
5,Captivating,"This might be this author's first novel, but Dan Blankenship is a master storyteller.The Running Girl was captivating! I was charmed immediately by the innocence of Kylee and the love, strength, and support shown by her family.The story instantly captured my attention & caught me off-guard as the suspense mounted. It also touched my heart and soul as the forces of evil became overpowered. (Very hard to put down)Best of all, the Running Girl leaves you with a feeling of increased hope and inspiration. I highly recommend this fascinating story to everyone!"
5,Captivating,"""The Running Girl"" was awesome! Well written and very captivating, it had me hooked from beginning to end. It is well worth reading again, and I would highly recommend it to anyone. I loved the Mantle family! The relationships between Kylee and her sister was really sweet.Mr. Blankenship did a wonderful job through the whole thing. It definately deserves five stars!"
4,A fun read with a strong message,"Dan Blankenship's first novel, 'The Running Girl', was a fun read all the way through. The spiritual warfare in the present day along with ties to the biblical times Nero was an interesting twist. I wanted to cheer for Kylee and her great faith. I do think the book could have been longer. I would have liked to see the relationships between the charachters developed more and see Kylee run the whole list of races. Overall a great effort on a first novel. I am sure we will be seeing more of this author in years to come!Kristin Slavik"
4,The Faith of a Child,"Yes! What a wonderful example of ""faith like a child."" Working in Children's ministry for over ten years, this is what I have had the privelege to witness! Dan's story presents the true (spiritual)warfare that exists and the simple (childlike) faith it takes to withstand the battle. I was moved and intrigued by the story's plot and very impressed with its easy read and imaginitive, but believable conclusion. When you pick it up, you won't want to put it down!"
2,Not bad,i must say i have to agree with reviewer michael king in his opinions of this being not bad for a first novel. in my opinion it began well but i lost interest after about chapter 8 as the story became too simplistic and unbelievable. if i'd known then what i know now i would not have spent my money on it
4,WRITER RUNS TO MEET CHALLENGE OF FIRST NOVEL,"I think what I liked about this book is the author's attention to detail. His first person character, Reese Mantle, is very likeable and easy to identify with as he weaves faith and doubt. I could empathize with the way he lives out his Christian faith.Being from Northwest Indiana made reading the book fun, as I could picture Kylee running in the Dunes of Lake Michigan(which are awesome- if you've never been there--go!).My husband read and enjoyed the book, too, especially all the action that takes place. My favorite part is the vision of the cross. It's worth the price of the book just to read that. Can't wait for the sequel!"
4,Eclectic Aggregation of Musicians Exceeds Expectations,"Is EVERY song on this collection great? No. But, some ARE great and most are well above average and nearly all of them capture the spirit and essence of the timeless sound of Weather Report. I have had these 2 CDs in my car for about 10 days and continue to be impressed by the quality of the music and irrepressible energy that went into this compilation. A song-by-song review is not necessary as there are too many to review. Buy and enjoy!"
2,short of the mark,Interesting to listen to once to make you appreciate just how wonderful Weather Report was. Just get the real thing!
1,Completely uninformative,I received this book as a gift and I had a hard time lying when they asked me a few weeks later if I liked it. It was completely uninformative and written poorly. I was told it got good reviews but I'm not suprised a co-author gave it good reviews.
2,Disappointed,"I loved Ladies with options and was so excited to see a sequel. However, I found the Ladies with prospects almost boring compared to the last book. I read the other reviews on this book and purchased the book but disagree with the reactions"
5,Not much more I can say that hasn't already been said except...,YOU MUST BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHO IS CONTROLLING THIS WORLD! This book has inspired me to not be afraid and to stand up for my european christian roots and to warn my brothers and sisters of the evil deeds the neo-con zionists are doing.
5,I really like this book!,"This book is one gem of a book. Filled with insightful commentary and cold hard fact, this book addresses what most choose to ignore, lest they be labelled 'sickos' as the first reviewer of this book took it upon themselves to do.Interestingly enough, the reviewer seemed to have a preoccupation with lambasting Mr. Duke, relying on an ad hominem to form the brunt of their response. Obviously they hadn't actually read the book, which is riddled with documented quotes from Jewish leaders - how can you deny quotes?Read the book for yourself then form your own opinion."
5,best bra ever,"This has got to be the best bra for lifting up, smoothing the sides and making you look like you had some ""work"" done as we females say. I work in a busy medical office and let me tell you, I move all sorts of ways, and this bra moves and works with me. I barely remember having it on. Even at a larger size, this bra is comfortable. Would recommend to anyone."
5,Great product,"Great bra with good coverage, good support. I get these because they come in hard to find sizes."
1,Madonnna Cone Bra!,"Please don't listen to the other reviewers if you are well endowed! This bra does fit well and hold you in, but it gives you cone boobs! That is not a look that I am going for and as such I'll be returning my purchase."
3,"Nice, but not nice.","I had a fitting and found I was a different size and cup than I had thought, so I had to buy new bras. I bought 2 of these bras from Elder Beerman because I like the way they looked when I tried them on and they seemed comfortable. I have to agree with other users that the straps are made too long. I am 5'2"" and have a short waist and have the straps as tight as they will go and still not quite tight enough. The bra is very nice. However, after wearing the bra now for 3 days, I am going to take the second one I purchased back to get a refund. This bra has a very wide underwire and it digs into one particular spot of my ribs just under each [...] It is making my ribs in those spots very tender and I notice it a lot when I am just putting it on for the day because it hurts. If it wasn't for that, I would say this bra was perfect, minus the straps being too long. So, if the underwire is not a problem for you, this bra has great shape and support."
5,Bra,I had been looking for this particular product in stores with no luck. The stores had the item in white or beige but not black. I was very pleased with both the price and the prompt delivery.
2,Straps slip off all the time,"I specifically purchased this bra to get one that stated the non-slip straps and this one is terrible. I like the feel of the bra, doesn't poke and is soft, but the straps drive me crazy!"
2,Not as described,"It took a long time to ship and get product,product was not as pictured or described either but correct size, will not do business with again. Was not sold by Amazon ,was sold by another company Amazon has always been great when purchased from them."
2,playtex bra,"I am not really that impressed with this bra. I do like that it has a thin foam lining, but the lining DOES NOT STRETCH as the product description says it does. Therefore, it does not conform to your curves & will cause spill-over depending on how well the cups fit. Another thing is that the straps do slip (in length & off your shoulders) & as other reviewers mentioned, they are almost too long & have to be adjusted to the shortest length. They also have to be adjusted everytime you put the bra on because after washing they will probably not be where you left them."
2,Makes you stick out too far,The bra made you stick out more to a point in your bust than you really are and not natural.
5,BEST WANDA BRA,"My sister wears like DD in bra. One day she saw this BRA on Amazon and tell me to buy it for her, so i did. A week later while I was at work she pass by to say Hi. So I said to her, ""Girl you breast them look like they are shrinking."" Then she said, ""it the bra that you buy for me on Amazon, that I am Wearing.""So now i want to tell everyone these BRA made my sister look a cup and a size smaller. Total transformation.So I give them a five star rating."
4,Great little cellar,"This wine cellar is a great value with decent capacity. It's also pretty quiet. My only complaint is that the warmest temperature setting is 53-57 degrees F. Red wine needs to be stored at 60 F. For reds, skip this model and get one with the digital thermostat."
2,This needs better packaging,"I was very pleased to find this item at this price. It arrived and had quite a few damages from shipping. Okay... Amazon has an easy return policy and we returned it and received the replacement very quickly. It also arrived damaged. This time a piece of plastic on the door frame corner had been broken off. We decided to keep it anyway and just glue the piece back on (the piece was there, just broken off.) We did not want to be in an endless cycle of returning damaged wine coolers! These damages occurred because the item is shipped in a cardboard box not adequate to the task. The item itself is great - and at a very nice price... Having it delivered damaged, twice, is not great. Perhaps if the item was bubble wrapped before being packaged it could reach its destinations intact."
3,Adequate,"I agree with the other reviews that state the packaging was lacking. It is a miracle that the unit was not damaged during shipping. Amazon should really insist that the packaging improve if they want to continue to sell this unit.Pros:It is a nice looking unit and you can switch the door from left to right if you need to which is nice.Cons:It is rather noisy and the shelf arrangement could be better.The tempature control is in the rear of the unit, so if you plan on putting this unit anywhere that prevents easy access to the back, you have to set the temp and just live with it.It also would be nice to have a thermometer included. Everyone is going to go out and purchase one, so why not just included it? I spent more in gas driving to the store to get one then I did on the actual thermometer."
3,Disc pad,Used it a few times and the stick it disc don't want to stick too well. Might be my disc have been sitting around for a while though the surface is not smooth like the Norton disc pad I had. The stick it disc worked great on it.
4,Real facts and inspiration,"my son loves this series because the author writes in real sports terms. Even though it is easy enough for a 1st or 2nd grader to read alone, it isn't baby-ish. We especially like the stories of players who beat the odds. A great series for your little hockey fan."
4,"Australian 60s band [before 80s band of same name]Also Olivia newton john songwriter,s 60s connection.","This is a fantastic 60s band that had quite a bit of success in Australia.However,songwriter john Farrar joined ex shadows members[brtish instumental group]Marvin and Welsh...to form a 3some band....""marvin,welsh and Farrar""....this was when the strangers broke up in the early 70s.John Faarar created some great songs in the strangers during their few lone up changes.One song that stands out written by john is ""lady scorpio"" and the song called ""happy without you""though was arranged by the band in this great remake of a previously written tune.That song has an exhilrating and upbeat sound connection to it after the band livened it up.Overall,the cd....is well worth listening to....though it may not be as good towards the end....as John Farrar had left the group as 70s came along.He became a prolific songwriter for Olivia newton john writing many hit songs for her.I give it 4 stars."
3,bought it once and liked it ..got mine at lowes,was a great combo proce to get portable tools away from any outlet...can do almost 100 percent of jobs with this kit when away from shop
5,Talk about WONDERFUL,"This book had everything I love in a book. Great characterization, wonderful plot, the perfect combination of romance, mystery, I can't say enought marvelous things. First of all the premise of the book was realistic and believable. I never had to suspense belief. because of the natural progresssion of the story. The characters were wonderully drawn. especially the heroine and hero. Likeable people who overcame their fears, and learned to communicate effectively. After reading this book, I definitely have put Ms. Richards on authors that I MUST buy list."
2,Product information...,"For those seeking the original recording of Fess Parker's ""The Ballad of Davy Crockett"" from 1955 on Columbia, be aware that the recording here is NOT that original version. The mid-50's Disney ""Frontierland"" series spawned the original recording, but Parker's recording wasn't released until after the one by Bill Hayes had already entered the charts. Parker's take of the song was rushed out to compete with Hayes' version but as a runner-up - while it did make the top-5 - it was overshadowed by Hayes' chart-topping rendition. The version of ""Ballad..."" presented here is the later re-recording that was part of the mid-60's album released on RCA in conjuction with Parker's TV series ""Daniel Boone""."
4,New Age Nirvana,"This CD will remind you of Enya. Its got a lot of drum and percussion work in some songs, while others are flute solos with some background accompaniment. Combining high intensity pieces and smooth peaceful melodies in one collection, Pangea is a very dynamic CD and will make a great addition to your New Age collection."
1,Delivery seems doubtful,"Delivery is not 1-2 weeks. I have been waiting a month for mine and the delivery date has just been modified to be 2 1/2 more months before it is expected to be delivered. One may consider shopping elsewhere for this item unless you are willing to wait at least 3 months to receive your merchandise.Update...my frig arrived today...badly damaged. The box was opened at the bottom and taped up...as if it had been returned prior to being sent to me. Inside I found it badly dented, as if dropped on its top and side. So...the wait goes on."
2,Good price but very poor cooling,Bought this beverage center over a year ago and it is nearly worthless. It barely cools beverages. I have it on maximum cold and if you put a fair amount of soda cans or water bottles in the unit it hardly cools them at all. If you want a COLD drink I would not recommend this unit. It's gotten to the point where I am going to toss it and buy a different brand. I would NOT buy on of these again under any circumstances.
1,Time Investment vs Product,The product arrived badly damaged and it has been over a month that I have been waiting for it to be replaced. I really thought that ordering this item would be a simple procedure and I would have my cooler within a reasonable amount of time. August has now become mid/late October or I could wait for a refund which could take up to 10 days!!!I should have listened to the other reviews...I am still waiting for someone in customer service to provide me with answers.
1,CAN YOU BE SERIOUS?!?,"Cooler was shipped in a cardboard box w/ absolutely NO protective packaging; Box bottom was hanging off, held only by 2 pieces of tape; entire bottom of cooler was CRUSHED & door was broken off -- After reading previous review, I wouldn't be surprised if the same busted cooler was re-shipped... TOTAL RIPOFF!"
1,Broken after two years,"Ordered from Walmart. Arrived badly damaged twice. 3rd one worked well, just died after 2.5 years."
3,So Far So Good,"Also ordered this unit from Walmart. After reading the previous reviews I immediately tried to cancel the order, but it was shipped anyway. True, my beverage center also has dents in it & at this point in time it seems unavoidable to have some type of damage. For my purposes, the dent is something I can live with. The dent is located in a concealed area - I consider myself lucky compared to the other reviews. Only had it for two days now & it seems to be working well. The fridge is stacked with both bottles & cans & everything is cold. - not ice cold but cold enough."
4,"Delayed shipment, but good product",The shipment of the product was significantly delayed. It did finally arrive and it's a solid unit; it does the job as advertised.
3,"Good, but not the best","As a long time fan of Patricia Veryan (all the way back to The Lord and the Gypsy) I have always enjoyed her books. Her characters manage to never take themselves too seriously, and the lighthearted moments make her books a wonderful read. Alabaster Royal was not one of her best efforts, however, as always she has delivered on creating a marvelously wicked villian (a man you can really love to hate), a feisty heroine in Consuela (who is, on occasion, a bit too impetuous), and a calm competent hero in Jack. His two feckless companions, Toby and Paige, add much to the story and the dialogue is filled with humor and wit. Although this was not one of Patricia Veryan's best efforts, it still made for a lot of humor, and adventure. As always, she delivers! Now, will someone explain why her books are so hard to obtain?"
5,Another winner,"The Riddle of Alabastor Royal is a must for all Veryan fans. As usual, Veryan delivers humor, adventure, heart-breaking characters, and mystery. I had no clue as to the identity of the villain and I was stunned when I turned to the last page because there were so many things left unsaid and unresolved! No immediate happy ending for Consuela and Jack, either. Veryan leaves us hanging but I'll gladly wait for the next installment (as long as she brings back Paige and Toby!!!)."
3,A mixed bag,"It's hard for me to rate RIDDLE OF ALABASTER ROYAL, as I liked the mystery but disliked the romance (well, there wasn't any romance). I didn't figure out the identity of the villain at all, and the clues were there, so Veryan was successful in that respect. However, her heroine, Consuela Jones, wasn't likeable at all. When you combine that with a total lack of romantic interest between the hero and heroine, you get a dud. What's more, as I read the book, I was reminded constantly of plot devices used by Georgette Heyer in her mysteries and romances such as THE QUIET GENTLEMAN and FOOTSTEPS IN THE DARK. The ending was most unsatifactory, as it left the reader hanging, but at least I'm not waiting on the edge of my chair for the next in the series. I think I'll pass on future Veryans."
4,Classic Regency,"Patricia Veryan is another author who bases her novels in the Georgian and Regency times. In depth characters, a sense of humour, who else would introduce the hero to his caretaker when the caretaker was locked up in the stocks?"
2,Well written by extremely silly plot and a heroine TSTL,"My first Veryan unfortunately. The plot was really stretching reality and the supporting details made no sense. What was Consuela's family doing camped out in the hero's home? Why would the hero be at all interested in Consuela? Was this really a romance? Lots of questions, few answers."
4,Caution - not a self contained story,"I'm a long time reader of Patricia Veryan - I enjoy her wit, unusual characters, intrigue and, of course, romance. This book had all of the characteristics. However, it was also like reading the first 2 acts of a 4 act play. While I have enjoyed Ms. Veryan's series, I also saw each as a self-contained story. This book had a deliciously frustrating ending."
3,not her best,"I had a hard time getting into this one. The way she developed several of her characters bothered me, especially Consuella. The plot was okay, but I had figured out who the ringleader was long before it was revealed. I love Patricia Veryan's books, but I think she needs to leave the mystery genre alone. I was eagerly waiting on this book and I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed."
4,Thoughtful sidenote to a fun book,"This is a signed, limited edition chapbook from Subterranean Press, with cover and interior illustrations by Bob Eggleton.Captain John Perry, in Old Man's War, did a goodwill tour of the colonies after the Battle of Coral. This is the Q&A; session from one of those stops, on the colony world of New Goa. There's no story here, really; just the back-and-forth between a combat veteran and some of the civilians the Colonial Defense Forces are defending-who have a variety of views of the CDF, the fact that it's composed entirely of old folks from Earth (colonists cannot enlist), and the perpetual state of war between humans and most other intelligent species they're in contact with. It's interesting, entertaining, and thoughtful."
3,Wait for the Short Story Collection,"This is a short story that just doesn't hold up alone, wait for the short story collection (I hope will someday come).Only the die hard John Scalzi fan needs this in their collection... and yes I still have mine."
1,"To short, not worth the price, unless you are fanatic","To short, not worth the price unless you are a fanatic for this series. This might have been a good thing to add on to the next book, or in a re-release of an older one in this series. It shouldn't have been sold seperately."
3,For fans only,"No real story here.A fill-in, some insight in John Perry's mind, some background of the Huckleberry colony and Savitri. Well worth USD 0.99 for dedicated fans of the series. If you just want a short and cheap action read, skip it."
4,Very good,But way too short. I'd love to delve into the mind of this character even more. Mr. Scalzi is an excellent story teller
4,Overpriced,"I immensely enjoyed the 3 novels in the Old Man's War series, and this is a nice fill-in type item. However, way overpriced."
3,Questions for a Soldier,"I did enjoy the short, with the emphasis on short, story. Would have liked a great deal more detail, especially considering the series seems to have come to and end."
5,Excellent return to a great universe,"Scalzi at his best is fantastic. I was horribly disappointed by the journal of whomever -- the soldier made from Old Man's War protagonist John Perry -- and seriously considered never reading anything of his again.This wonderful -- and too danged short! -- visit with Perry was wonderful, the veritable balm in Gilead for a ""classic Scalzi"" fan. I get that you don't want to be typecast, John, but take us back to that place now and then, willya?<g>"
2,skip,"It's not a book - it's not an essay - it is a rip off. I admit, I missed the part about the length of this one when I bought it. But it is hardly worth the effort to read. More of an exercise in imagination than a story, I can't recommend it.Look closely at the 'cheap' books on Kindle - most are trailers for the series and not very good reading."
5,Loved it,"I picked up Naida West's ""River of Red and Gold"" at the California State Fair in August 2006 on one of the days she and other authors were promoting their books. She explained how she researched the historical events in her story and my interest was peaked. I'm no history buff, but, I found it intriguing and difficult to put down. Her descriptions of living conditions and the characters put a clear picture in my imagination. I didn't want it to end."
5,This vid is slammin'!,"I am a really big Rap fan from the UK. Rap videos aren't really avalible in England but when I went to New York this summer, I picked up this one. I took back home and stuck it in my multi-system VCR, and it was probably the greatest hour of music, I've ever had. Like I said, this video is literily ""SLAMMIN'!"""
2,LOOK AT THE COPPER!!!!,When I bought this item there was only one person on here saying bad things about the kit. Anyone who has bought this kit needs to disconnect their power wire and take a look at how much actual copper wire in inside the insulation. The price of the kit is really good.......but if you need to power a good size amp you can forget about this thing doing the job.the reason I bought the kit was to power a kenwood kac-x20 amp(which only requires 8 gauge wire) which I was going to hook up for the mean time. I also have a kenwood kac-x40 amp which i was going to buy a distribution block for the so called 4 gauge power wire and run 8 gauge from there to the two amps. But with the wire being so thin that will not work with what I want to do. So needless to say I will be returning this kit sender.
5,Good economical kit,"This kit came with everything you need. The other review says 17 ft may be a little short but I drive a Cadillac Sedan DeVille, one of the longest cars made, and it's plenty. I just wish they would've pre-terminalized the power cord. If you know what you're doing, you could run all these wires and power your amp in an hour. The insulation on the wires is really thick so you'll need a utility knife to cut that off. It's a great kit, especially for the price."
3,no instructions with it,this amp kit is ok it should come with some directions for people who dont know what there hooking up.so im glad ive done systems before
1,Do not by this.,The Product details say that there is 33 ft. of 12 gauge speaker wire that come with this package. The kit i received only came with 17. It even says so on the package. This is disgusting and deceiving. Will Not buy from this seller again
4,Absurdly awesome!,"I went into this movie not expecting much, but it ended up being one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in a long time! It's pretty indie- the special effects remind me of the first season of Buffy- and there are some plot holes here and there, but that's true of most horror films. And the ending is AWESOME. I laughed, I cringed, and I jumped a few times, too.So, when it comes to a group movie night, this one's got everything you need except the popcorn."
3,Pretty Decent Movie with a Ton of Bonus Material-worth the buy,"I think it's a fun movie that's worth the watch. A low budget flick but far better than most straight to video horror. Since I made the movie I am trying to not be biased here but I think everyone involved did a great job with what we had to work with and particularly the cast, Mike Carlisi really stood out as well as the supporting cast: William Martin, Kari Wishingrad, Jack Stahl and Lee Kahn, they all did a fantastic job. Had we more time to fix the script issues this could have been a 4-5 star movie. The DVD is packed with bonus material unlike most DVD's and is worth the purchase plus the cover has some great artwork of the book itself.Hell House: The Book of Samiel"
4,A MUST HAVE!!!,"everything you could expect from a cordless circular. comes with guide. latch on guard is pressure locking, so tends to come loose with constant sawing, but overall a great saw."
2,Gutless,"My father and I work construction. about two years ago we bought this saw and in that time, it may have been used twice on the job. most of the time it doesn't even go to work because it is so utterly gutless that it is nearly useless. It sounds overworked just cutting through a 2x4 at 90 degrees. if the blade binds any, forget it, the blade stops no matter what you are cutting through. if the battery isn't fresh you will feel resistance cutting through 1/2"" ply. if you value your time, do not get this saw. you will spend twice the time cutting than you will with a corded wormdrive saw."
1,WORTHLESS!!!,"I ordered two Sylvania bulbs and got two no-name bulbs. The 30-watt filament in the first bulb lasted a week and the 70-watt lasted two. The second bulb did a little better, with the 70w lasting over a month."
4,Splendid and informative,"Hetzer and Penny have excelled themselves with this fine work, which truly does offer 94 napkin folds. They are all relatively simple, even for people at the art of their origami careers. The book loses a star, though, for not properly discussing which fold is best suited to the Subbuteo tabletop."
2,Somewhat palatable,"Being a napkin enthusiast, naturally I'm quite an avid fan of Linda Hetzer, however, I find it immensely unnerving that she inexcusably has omitted several key napkin folding solutions. Apparently, she just wouldn't make the effort to list 100 Fancy Folds, just only 94 - how revolting...."
4,"Fun, if You're into this kind of stuff","After getting the book, we hosted a dinner party. We photocopied several pages from the book and stuck one copy under each guest's plate. To my surprise, people were totally into it - they happily started practicing ""their"" fold, invented new ones, and just had a good time.More to the point, though - the book is aesthetically pleasing, the designs are possible to follow (although not always *easy* to follow), and in all it's exactly what I expected - a book that shows how to fold napkins in neat ways."
2,SoSo,There weren't as many interesting folds as I had expected. Lots of them are variations of the same thing with only very slight differences that are hardly noticable.
4,Rock Baby Rock It,It is a marvelous visit to my younger days. Knew this performer in the late 50's early 60's was amazed to find this almost complete discography available. Better quality than I expected and a grand revisit to my teen years.
2,Filling in time,3 Nights of listening to this in the hope that it would live up to the passengers soundtrack but it does not even come close to the high standards set by that album. The only track that I would come back to is The Ground Beneath Her Feet. The other tracks are weak. The soundtrack lacks the creative input given to the Passengers Soundtrack and POP and is disappointing.
3,Unfinished business,"On the whole the album is quite good, probably better than the messy Pop. The new U2 tracks sound unfinished though, and the Sex Pistols cover and Milas effort on Satellite of Love are both very dodgy. Worth hearing.The ""Ground beneath her feet"" sounds a bit naff to begin with until it gets going, but is stunning eventually."
5,Million Dollar Hotel,All I have to see is the letter U and number 2 combined side by side and I knew this CD would be fantastic. I haven't been able to see the movie yet as it's not available where I live - but if it is anywhere near as good as the soundtrack then it's got my vote!
4,a must for U2/Bono fans,"This CD is wonderfully satisfying to U2 fans. There are six tracks on the album either performed by Bono or U2, and each of these tracks is done in the melodic, soothing style which is most like Actung Baby of the U2 albums. There is also some pleasing jazz instrumentals which are very easy on the ears. The one drawback, as other reviewers have agreed, is ""Satellite of Love,"" which is alright until it descends into a gravely shreiking cacophony that leaves you searching for the skip button on your player. One track should not keep buyers away, however. It is really a delight as the popular ""Ground Beneath her Feet"" is not the only Bono/U2 gem on the album."
4,The Million Dollar Hotel,"""The Ground beneath Her feet"" is one of the most powerful tracks in years from Bono and the boys. I can't wait to hear the new album"
3,I LOVE U2 BUT!,"i am a large ""u2""fan and as soon as i saw this cd i ordered it, i found it a dark and moody album with no uplifting song's at all the single""ground beneath her feet"" is a good cut but it is also moody there are no song's on it likethere are on ""achtung baby""or""the joshua tree""unless you want to sit and listen and get deppressed ? i would pass on this album ! maybe if you saw the movie? it would be a better listen?""i havent""seen it"""
3,Good - Yes...New- Not a chance,Whoever started the rumor that bold things are in store for the new U2 album based on this soundtrack has not followed the boys from Dublin very closely. Many U2 fans will recognize some of these tunes as B-sides from the 80s. No wonder it sounds like the U2 of old... Let's hope they continue forward and not back...
2,Where's Waldo,"I am an avid U2 fan and understand that as the band experiments, reinvents, pushes the envelope, etc. that we have to be patient and listen, re-listen, and give the music a chance. So it is with this record. But finding the U2 aspect of the soundtrack is a little like finding Where's Waldo. On some tracks its very obvious, on others its virtually impossible.I'll keep listening but so far its a disappointment."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I purchased this cd for the 2 new U2 songs (one of which, ""The Ground Beneath Her Feet"", easily ranks with the best U2 output of old) and the Brad Mehldau/Bill Frisell track (""Tom Tom's Room""). I had hoped the rest of the album (which includes 3 Bono tracks--nothing great here) would have some pleasant surprises. Instead, it is virtually unlistenable. To begin, the Mehldau/Frisell piece is ruined by some non-sensical talk about a shaved beaver. The 2 (yes, 2) remakes of ""Satellite of Love"" are nothing short of torture due to the screams of the movie's star (Milla Jovovish from the remake of Blue Lagoon). And to make matters worse, the album concludes with a horrible remake of a horrible song (done in Spanish). Please, save your money. I would rank this album 1-star if not for the U2/Lanois/Rushdie brilliance on song 1."
2,"Nice, but not enough...","This is an album with many older U2 melodramatic songs. SOme of them are very good, but most of the album is boring. I gave it a mark of 2 (and not zero) only because of the people that made this albums - U2, Bono, Brian Eno, Lou Reed and more.I recommend you to buy it only if you're a serious U2 fan."
1,Only for U2 fans,I am a big U2 fan and I don't really like this. There are a couple really good songs on it but other than that... not for the average listener.
3,Clueless,"Okay, so it may not be a GREAT album, but the Milla-bashing is just inexusably misinformed. Milla's smoky vocals are lovely. It is Bono who does the horrid squawking at the end. If you listen toward the end of the song they take the FX off and you can hear him. It would have been a great song without it."
4,U2 is constantly thinking... and that is enough.,"U2's latest offer with such heavyweights as Brian Eno, Daniel Leonis, and John Hassell is a hit for me. There is a space in this CD that is not matched by any other CD. The songs from ""Falling At Your Feet"" through ""The First Time"" reprise is such a beautiful auditory experience, I recommend it. Milla's screeching just doesn't sit well, nor does the final track's vocals, but you can hear U2 still thinking and experimenting and that is a enough."
4,Buy it for the Frisell stuff,"I bought this way back in 2000 for the U2 songs (in fact, I have still not even seen the film). Repeated listenings over the past 5 years has led me to the conclusion that the finest material on this album is the instrumental stuff comprised of the non-U2 groups. Bill Frisell fans should pick this album up for sure, as a couple of songs he plays are breathtakingly beautiful.Unfortunately, you'll have to skip over the song titled ""Satellite of Love"" because Milla screams and gargles over a good portion of it, leading me to cringe uncomfortably - I really like her in movies, but this vocal performance is sad and annoying.But aside from that, the album is worth buying for the reasons I gave above."
4,"Meeeeeel-yon dollah hotel, yah","Seems Queen Mab has been speaking in Bono's ear. Again.Yer Man gestated MDH for a decade before he & Eno & Lanois et. al. let fly. Dreamy, quixotic, & very cool is how I'd describe the first half of the Million Dollar Hotel soundtrack. I prefer it to the last half.Good music to play while you soak in the bathtub with candles for company."
3,Very mixed...,"Basically I have to re-itterate what most other people have said: the U2 tracks are great. I bought the album based on them, and was not disappointed with their contributions. ""The Ground Beneath Her Feet"" is soaring and moody, and definitely ranks among my favorite U2 songs of all time. ""Stateless"" is also good, though it lacks the ""hit"" calibre of the first track. But other than that, this album is mediocre at best. Yes, Milla Jovovich cannot sing--her screaching grates so terribly I had to rush across the room to skip the track as soon as I heard it. The rest of the music inspires images of dark, smokey bar rooms or rain soddened city streets...but unless your in the mood, it's not too much fun to listen to."
3,TO U2 OR NOT 2 U2,"HUMMM... WELL THANKS FOR REMINDING ME WHY I DON'T AS A RULE BUY SOUNDTRACK ALBUMS NO MATTER HOW MUCH I LIKE THE FEATURE GROUP. THE U2 STUFF HERE IS GREAT. MELODIC, HAUNTING, AND FULL OF THE GUTS AND SOUND THAT YOU EXPECT FROM THE IRISH GANG. BUT... AND A HUGE BUT...THE BALANCE OF THIS ALBUM IS MEDIOCRE TO JUST PLAIN BAD. THE ROCK CUTS ARE GENERIC AND BLAND, THE JAZZ CUTS ARE WEAK, AND MILLA'S 2 FORAYS INTO SONG ARE THE WORST THING I'VE HEARD SINCE THE FIRST YOKO ONO SOLO ALBUM. KIDDING ASIDE, THE SCREECHING ACTUALLY STARTLED MY POOR DOG...DIDN'T DO A LOT FOR ME! THIS CD IS DESIGNED FOR THE DO IT YOURSELFER...TAPE OR BURN THE U2 STUFF TO LISTEN TO, AND CAN THE CD ONTO THE BACK SHELF..."
4,"Million Dollar Hotel captures ""Blue Mood""","This is a wonderful soundtrack to a movie that people probably won't be able to see until it hits the ""New Releases"" section in your video store. Bono and Daniel Lanois beautifully capture admiration in ""Falling at your Feet"". U2 comes to the forefront with the powerful ""Ground Beneath Her Feet"" and Adam and Larry show how good they have become in U2's ""Stateless"". This soundtrack is a great listen ""after dark"" and should not be viewed as a new U2 album. Soundtracks have provided clues as to what U2's sound could be like for the next album (Captive-Joshua Tree), (Passengers- Pop). Turn the lights low, grab your partner, and you'll find the Million Dollar Hotel."
5,Start here to be a Jump fan for life!!,"Jump, Little Children has been a god-sent to me as well as the hundreds of other Jump fans across the USA (and beyond!) If you weren't fortunate enough to get ""The Licorice Tea Demos"" and ""Buzz"" when they were originally released, now's your chance!! Plus, it comes with previously released songs, including my favorite, ""15 Stories"". ""Early Years"" is a great way to start off your J,LC collection, or bring back the old stuff into your life. Also check out ""Magazine"" and ""Vertigo,"" Jump, Little Children's other cds, and find out why so many people have fallen in love with their heartfelt lyrics, unique sound, and the pure harmony every second of every song brings. Check out a live show near you and you'll get the full Jump experience! I highly recommend this 2-cd set, as well as all other Jump, Little Children cds!"
2,Tore down the back with one year old inside,"We absolutely loved this swing for the first week it was installed in our home! However, while I was swinging my 1 year old son, the buckle that tightens the sides tore away in the back and split nearly the entire length of the back. We were so sad to have Haba, a company for which we have huge respect, let us down like this. Note ""Designed in Germany, Made in China"" and the quality issue. Very sad to see our-go-to brand lose so much respect from a true ""Made in Germany"" family! :("
1,Possibly the worst film ever made.,"One star is one too many for this piece of puerile drivel. Plotless and virtually scriptless, badly ""acted"", a cheap piece of sensationalism. I can't think of a single redeeming thing to say about it other than that at least it ended. AVOID."
2,FEAR THE FLICK,"A new highly contagious virus is killing people, accidentally let loose in Eastern Europe. To make matters worse an infected killer cannibal is on the loose in a quarantined area of Boston immigrants. Delon (Natasha Henstridge) who has her own issues leads the gang that couldn't shoot straight against a man with a knife who is not John Rambo. Most of the film is consumed with a boring game of cat and mouse played out between our killer and the good guys.The movie we are told takes place in Boston, but was filmed in Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina which has noticeably different architecture. The police cars are small and have ""Policia"" written on the back. Who will notice?I was able to purchase this film along with 5 others on a contagious film 6-pack at Walmart for $5.00Parental Guide: F-bomb, no sex, no nudity. Scantily clad corpse with arms covering chest."
2,What the heck did Adrenalin (sp) refer to?,"Was this pre-Species? Anyhow, I don't get it, what was the point of the monster..., an army experiment gone awry, a plague treatment gone awry, a CIA experiment gone awry? We're given no explanation. An Adrenalin(e) experiment gone awry? Adrenalin (sp) refers to ??? the bloodshot eyes?This was Boston? Maybe the Boston in the Czech Republic. Our police chief did not have a Boston accent.Interesting point- the monster uses a gun!It was unexpected!Can you imagine the Alien shooting at Ripley with a hand gun? It adds a strange dimension to the 'demon in the dark' sense of danger that your usual horror film goes for. That just ain't right.Did the DVD have any extras on it- like a director commentary as to what the heck he was thinking?"
4,Adrenalin was a good movie,"A lot of people are being harsh towards Adrenalin: Fear the Rush, when it was actually a pretty good movie. The only problem with the movie is the setting. Otherwise the plot and characters were actually pretty good. It had suspense and a few thrills. If you like science fiction type movies, atleast give this movie a chance."
2,Nostalgia Stings,"I must say, when I originally saw this movie, I was a teenager. I thought it would be a good film to see again now (a decade later), but now realize that I really HAVE changed since then. The movie was nowhere near as exciting to me now as it once was. Perhaps I could donate it to some kid looking for something older than he/she is. However, I doubt that any true teen with CGA capabilities swimming through their head would appreciate such a film, so perhaps a resell elsewhere will suffice."
1,horrible from beginnning to end,"one of Lamberts sucky films with him and Henstridge going after a man with a virus that can speard and they have to kill him before its to late. begins corny with its lame intro to the killer and its god awful few seconds late suspense music, though theres the part where Lambert gets shot up a bunch of times. strikly for nobrainers"
4,a different kind of movie,"If you're looking for a good story, performances and dialogue look somewhere else. Adrenalin: Fear the Rush (love that name!), deliberately avoids all three, preferring to concentrate on non-stop action, and low-budget action is what Albert Pyun (directer) does best.While this doesn't appeal to many, if you get into the action you will find Adrenalin a tense and exciting journey, and never boring."
5,AMAZING!!!,"This video is absolutely amazing!It's action packed,and it will scare the hell out of you.It'll keep you coming back for more!!!I definitly request it!!!"
3,An excellent movie...,"This movie is one of many movies that I have seen over and over again. The plot is set very early, which gets it right out the way so you can experience, the RUSH. ""Adrenalin"" will keep you on the edge of your seat. The suspence and well placed screen shots, help add to the action. Thats why this movie doesn't need all those fancy effects. Which today, seem to be over used. This movie is atleast one to check-out...but don't take my word for it, look at it yourself. People these days expect something from a film, and if the film doesn't give them that exact detail, they turn on the film and call it ""A waist of time."" I just wanted to put my view out there...thank you for your time."
5,very well made,Bought this visor for my mother who was having trouble finding a quality visor at a reasonable price. She loves it and I'm sure I'll be shopping here again.
4,"'Songs The Cramps Taught Us, Volume 1' (Unofficial Release) Various Artists","What exactly do they mean by 'unofficial release'? Either way, I've seen this various artists tribute Cramps CD as well as the two follow-ups online and in an independent record store or two. Glad to have been able to finally hunt down a copy. Liked pretty much all (if not most) of these thirty-one songs performed by a variety of punk, garage rock, blues and rockabilly bands and artists. Some I've heard of and a few that I've never remotely heard of. Just a few of these tunes that did a lot for me were The Sparkles with ""Hipsville 29 BC"", The Sonics (though, they were the band who originally recorded this goodie ""Strychnine"", the awesome Third Bardo with ""Five Years Ahead Of My Time"", Ronnie Cook & The Gaylads with ""Goo Goo Muck"" and the rockabilly legend Jack Scott's ""The Way I Walk"". I didn't realize that The Cramps had done so many covers. Recommended."
4,"Very solid thrash, sophomore effort","VIRUS was a solid, if not spectacular thrash-band that got lost in the huge number of bands doing the same thing... While ""Force Recon"" isn't anything different from most of the other thrash bands, it is a very good album. No filler on this one! I really like how they stay on course and don't get into anything soft. Pure thrash metal here!"
5,I like Toby,Toby is cool. My mom and I read it twice already. I like Tut he's a funny dog and he loves Toby very much. Lauren is a very smart girl too. I am learning how to draw Toby alot. I like the website too there are funny games on it.
5,Best Children's Chapter book this year!,"It's about time. My children are smart kids. I have always had a difficult time finding chapter books they would actually engage in, but this new series hit the mark, Toby Digz is a great character and I was so impressed with the format of the book.The author has gone out of his way to obviously keep the kids interested. When you reach the last pages, there are all sorts of unique charts and games. This man know his audience well! Good job Tommy Nelson! Keep them coming."
4,Good value for the price,"Cover fits the chair pretty decently. Only drawback is it doesn't stay in place all that well on this particular chair, even with the ties tied. That might just be due to the style of this chair; it might not be a problem for something with a little less cushion. For the price and overall quality, though, I would still recommend it."
2,not so great,"This slip cover feels really nice, but never stayed smooth, and looked really sloppy. Plus the sizing was odd. I ordered what was supposed to fit amply, and it was a stretch."
3,looks good but fits poorly,subject is enoughwith the exception of it time were taken to better explain different methods of securing the ties and providing more ties it would be great!
3,Slipcovers,"My furniture is leather and the slipcovers do exactly that, they slip. I had to put ties at the bottom to tie the slipcovers around the legs. That helped but the slipcover won't stay tucked between the cushions."
2,Great looking and functional but way too loud!,"This blender looks great on the counter and functions well; we use it daily to make smoothies and it chops ice easily.However, I've owned six blenders and this is by far the loudest. I expect a blender to be very loud, but this is truly ear-splitting. My last blender was also an Osterizer and the noise level was much better.We've lived with this one for about four months and have finally had enough and are going to buy a different blender even though this one still works. (I'm going to look at Consumer Reports and see if their reviews cover noise level!)I see that there are several identical blenders listed on Amazon. Mine is model #4094. Perhaps I just got a bad one and most are fine, but I'd stay away from model #4094. Since this blender entry doesn't specify the model #, I'd be wary."
4,Best Blender Ever,I got this blender as a wedding gift and it turned out to be one of my favorite gifts. This blender crushes ice with no problem it's great for frozen drinks. Highly recommend this blender it not only looks great but it works great too.
1,"Worked once, then quit!","I bought this blender because it was stylish, yet inexpensive. It worked very well the first time I used it. The next time, it wouldn't power up at all. I guess the motor just died. I was very disappointed."
1,Junk,"I bought one of these because it claimed to be heavy duty. Mine suffered electrical failure almost immediately. And look at the grab nub on the cap. It's smooth and beveled backwards (like a teepee instead of like a vee), so if your fingers are the least bit slippery, you cannot use that nub for its sole and only purpose, which is to remove the cap. Poor reliability and careless design work by a company that's been making blenders far too long to be putting out a product like this."
1,Worked well until IT BROKE AFTER 2 MONTHS OF USE,"My problem with this blender is the same as some others have apparently had. The plastic part in the blender's base, that drives the blades, broke while crushing frozen fruit. Don't buy this one!"
1,not what I expected,"I was very excited to receive this blender after reading all the reviews. However, when I received this blender, I was extremely disappointed. This is by far the loudest appliance ever! I thought something was wrong, so I double-checked to make sure everything was in place. I put in 3 cups of ice and expected they would all be crushed, that didn't happen. I had to remove the many pieces of icecubes in order to give my children the snow cones they were expecting. I will return this product!"
5,"Durable, Powerful Blender",My wife and I had two cheap plastic blenders that burned up on us from normal use so we bought this blender because it seemed solid and we liked the look of it. After using it for 2 years we are very satisfied. It has blended many smoothies and blended ice coffee drinks with no problem and still performs like new. I would highly recommend this blender to anyone.
4,yeah it's loud but ....,So this beehive baby is loud BUT NOT THAT LOUD and I use it in my office with my door closed. No complaints yet. It has 2 speeds and that is all I need for ice and a healthy shake. So far no leaks and I love how it looks. I say get it. This product has one of the best reviews and so far it is standing up to the name brand I have come to love. I just wanted to give my 2 cents on the review since I think some people that give reviews complain way too much.Again I have given this a 4 because I need to see how it works after a few months ...so far so good.
2,Another one Bites the Dust,"I bought my first Oster beehive blender around August 2002 and I loved it from the start, but after about 4 months, the rubber piece that holds the drive shaft snapped in two. Thinking this was a fluke, I bought another beehive blender since it had performed so well before breaking (I use it nearly every day to crush ice for smoothies). And now, 4 months later, the second one broke the same way. This is obviously not a fluke."
2,Good Looking But...,"This blender actually looks good sitting on the counter. But, after having it for two years, I see two major flaws: 1) It's ear-splittingly loud, and 2) It has a lot of trouble with thick or chunky stuff. I literally wear earplugs when I use this blender. And, when I make hummus with canned chickpeas or smoothies with frozen fruit, I'm constantly having to turn the thing off, stir the contents with a long-handled spoon, and try to blend again. Even though it's not as stylish, I've decided to save my hearing and my spoons and go back to the fantastic Krups blender I had before."
2,Great Features but Too Loud,"I give it a 5 star on design -- I like the smaller 5-cup size (not too heavy), the sleek look, the simple on/off switch, and it's simple to clean. However I give it a zero rating on noise level. It is way too loud, I really wish I hadn't purchased it due to this."
1,The Loudest Blender Ever Made,"I'm sure this blender works fine, but I will never know because when I turned it on to test it out, the noise was so ear-splitting that I turned it right off and returned it."
1,Motor died ... very frustrating.,"I had the same problem ""leugim ttol"" had. After a year and a half of limited use, it died. There was a thick molasses-like substance on the bottom of the pitcher where you stick it into the base. The substance made it so that the base couldn't turn the blades. I fixed it the first time by taking a screw driver and sticking it into the hole in the bottom of the pitcher and spinning it until the substance leaked out even more. I then wiped it all off and was able to get my drink mixed. I went back to it a couple of weeks later and found the same thing. Only this time when I turned on the motor, there was a blue spark and a bad smell. Yep, it burned out. I would say that between me and my roommate, we only used the blender no more than 15 times. And we ALWAYS had liquid in the bottom. I am very disappointed in the product. I spent the extra money and bought Oster because I heard the motors were better than others. Money wasted! Never again!"
2,The noise is riduculus!,"There is no reason for a blender to be this loud with nothing in it, other than poor quality materials and lack of engineering. I just purchased it and will return it immediately."
5,A GREAT blender!,"This is a super powerful blender. I purchased this for a housewarming present for my sister and we have made quite a few smoothies and drinks. Never, ever a problem with items getting stuck. And it crushes ice like a dream. A great buy and perfect performance."
5,Awesome!,"This blender makes a smoothie out of a pitcher full of ice in 10 seconds flat! It only has two speeds, but that is all you will ever need. It's heavy and steardy - no sissy here! Great gift for anyone!"
2,way too loud...,"model 4126 redlooks nice, blends wellWAY FRIGGIN' TOO LOUD!!!you'll need ear protection,if you want to hearyour future grandchildren.tried to contact ""customer service"",to no avail.filed a CPSC complaint."
2,Powerful but broke within 1 month of purchase,"I give this product 2 stars because the powerful motor really blended things up nicely. 1 star would be more appropriate!HOWEVER, this blender cannot handle frozen fruit or ice. The post that insterted to turn the blades was held on by rubber which broke against the slight strain of small frozen fruit.I would not buy this blender if you plan to use ice or frozen fruit. Also, the design of the lid sucks;the plastic insert that you can remove so as to add things while blending was very loose and fell into the blender and got chopped up (for a few seconds)."
2,TOO LOUD!,"I had read some reviews of this product under this model but purchased the copper model. People said it was loud. I thought, of course it's loud, all blenders are loud. Received it today. Sounds like a jet engine is taking off in my kitchen. Yeah, that loud. The kids had their hands clamped over their ears and my husband and I were screaming over the noise. And I hadn't even added the ice yet! I got a large bath towel to wrap around the base and it muffled the sound somewhat, but I'm pretty sure I have permanent hearing loss.The copper is beautiful and it chopped the ice without struggling, but wow. SO LOUD!"
2,Worked perfect for three years.,"I have to admit I bought it for the looks, but the Oster name hasbeen around forever. How could I go wrong. For three years, and about 5-8 actual uses, it worked fine.That all ended tonight, and I didn't even use it. I pulled it off the countertop so I could clean behind it, and there was a five by two inch puddle of thick molasses like oil on my counter.I should mention this is quartz so I'm okay. But, someone with a granite counter would most likely be in bad shape. Funny thing too, this is the only blender I've ever seen that has leaked like this. I pulled the bottle off, and there was a nice pool around the drive cam as well. Awesome! I expected more for my $50."
2,Disappointed,"Although the blender is very powerful, it had trouble blending ice to make two pina coladas. I had to turn off the blender and stir the pina colada mix, and ice, with a spoon four times before all the ice was crushed...and that was only the first drink of the evening.<br />I made another drink later and had the same problem with the ice. Instead of turning the blender off and stirring the mix myself, I shook the blender with both hands and accomplished the job.<br />I guess that I was expecting a blender that could handle crushing ice efficiently and without my assistance.<br />I would not purchase this blender again or recommend it to anyone.<br />Next time, I will get a Kitchen Aid."
4,Crisp Orange Flavor - Great Substitution,"I was hesitant to buy a larger bottle at first because I had read some reviews regarding a clear bottle and a decrease in quality from OliveNation, so I bought the smallest container to try it out. I encourage you to ignore the previous review about there being alcohol in the extract: all extracts are suspended in alcohol- normally a pure fruit oil and alcohol mixture.Anyways, the extracts were well packaged and shipped quickly. I was pleased to find that the 4 oz container is tinted glass and the aroma is superb. I have used the extract in various baked goods and it provides a bright orange flavor.I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who is in short supply of fresh orange juice. This makes an excellent substitution."
5,Fresh and exciting!,"I was in search of new, fresh, and exciting worship music. Unfortunately, there's been a dry spell of good worship music.Lo and behold... someone told me about The Exodus. I went to their website at [...]and sampled some of their tracks. I thought it was a fresh new sound, something I'd been looking for.Long story short, I bought the CD and I love it! It's a mix of contemporary worship (like Chris Tomlin, Matt Redman, Tim Hughes) with a slight twist of mainstream music (like U2, Lifehouse, Creed) and very much in tune with the current popular sound of music."
4,"Good books, awful editing","The Ages of Chaos is an omnibus edition, containing the two of MZB's Darkover novels that she wrote about early Darkovan history. It is set about 1000 years after colonisation, during the period that the ruling families warring against one another and were breeding for Laran (psi-powers).Unfortunately, this edition is really, really awful to read because of poor editing - every now and again there is a sentence that makes no sense until the reader suddenly realises that a word is missing a letter, or a word is missing entirely from the sentence. eg. ""He could see it in her yes..."" - yes=EyesApart from the cryptic editing, it is still a good read for Darkover fans (not the best to start reading the series with), and a cheap way to buy a couple of classic SF/FAN novels."
1,Great Cover - Skip the rest,"In reading the other reviews, I was really looking forward to this book. Unfortunately, I struggled to get through the short 94 pages. The tone is condescending and the content is more a collection of the author's random, disconnected thoughts presented as useless pieces of ""advice"" on what you should and shouldn't do. (So much for ""being yourself at last""). The additions of scientific research used to validate the author's opinion seem out of place and more like a desperate attempt to prove she's saying something worthwhile. The author's use of language often seems forced, almost as if she's trying too hard. For example, a section entitled ""Beyond the Dualistic Approach"" starts off ""The relentless search for the best is not a pursuit of excellence, but an attempt to create a duality between what's on top and what's on the bottom..."" Wow! In general, there was nothing insightful for me in this one."
2,So So,I wasn't blown away by this book and found the message to be pretty basic. I mean there was nothing in the book that was inspiring and there was nothing in the book I didn't already know. I was rather disappointed.
4,Growing up also means growing old,"It's a mixed bag, this growing up stuff. Pushing 40 or 50 is not all it's cracked up to be. I refer you to another tome, ""Getting Old Sucks."" But on the whole, it sure beats the alternative of ""growing down."""
5,"not necessarily growing ""old""","to me, this book is not about growing old, it's just about changing. we are all constantly in states of change, growth, learning and relearning and it's important to let our authentic selves shine. so whether you're 15 or 85, we can all learn more about being ourselves."
4,Very good overview of Nichiren Daishonin buddhism,This book is an excellent summary of the history of buddhism with a focus upon the practices of Nichiren Daishonin. Ikeda has a wonderful writing style with emphasis upon historical facts and schools of buddhism.
3,"Works, but needs additional accessories.","It comes with eight resistors in different measurements, but does not come with enough adapters. All of the resistors are BNC Female, which means to be useful, they either need a BNC Male to F-type Male, or the BNC male to male converter - of which there is only one. Most BNC wall plates use BNC Female connectors. At a minimum, you would want to purchase at least one BNC male to male cable (for the transmitter), to compliment the one provided in the kit. However - that doesn't help with the F-type connectors typically found on Coaxial cabling in the home. Expect to pay at least an additional $20 for accessories (which are apparently not available currently from the manufacturer site) Other than that, the unit works just fine."
1,it does not work for catv,Without special adapters it only works for close circuit television it does not work for cable tv installations without special adapters
1,Bogus! NOT a Unicel filter!!,"I bought this filter understanding it was a Unicel brand filter. It is NOT! It is a Aqua Kleen AK-3049. Hopefully it will perform and last as long as my Unicel did (5 yrs +), but somehow I doubt it. Buyer beware! I find this sort of bait and switch very unsavory."
2,Not as described,"Purchased these because detail listed as unicel, products received were after market, not unicel brand. Would appreciate getting what is advertised. Last purchase from this seller I'm afraid."
3,The Center Hole Is Too Snug,"The price is great for this item, but I found that the center hole is just a bit too small. It fits too tightly in the spa pump. It makes it very difficult to remove the filter in order to clean it. I had to use a hook to pull it out because it was too tight and it was too hard to remove it with my fingers."
1,Horrible,"I wish I didn't have to even give it one star! Zero stars describes it best. This book was thee most horrible thing I have read about deaf/hearing-impaired children. Not only was it written way over a normal person's head in medical speak, but it was so very negative that it left me feeling sick to my stomach. It told many ""facts"" about how deaf children are 'lesser' and do not achieve or 'cannot' achieve things (education, speaking, reading, etc) that any other normal hearing child could. These 'facts' are not true and/or are outdated and only make your ""stress"" worse. It continues to harp on the 5 stages of grief and how a parent goes through these when you have a deaf/hearing-impaired child. DO NOT get this book if you are a parent! I wish I never read it."
3,Decent movie--Poor transfer,"I watched this DVD last night. Plot involves a young woman (Arline Judge) who goes into Panama hoping to further her career by singing in a club called the Bull Ring. The club is more of a place where the women hustle the male patrons to buy booze at inflated prices. On her way there, she meets a businessman (Preston Foster) who has an interest in her and tries to dissuade her from working in Panama. She winds up falling for a patron of the club and hopes to marry him, but he is still married. Her career goes downhill as she works for a sleasier club, then to prostitution.This film is more ""pre-Code"" than noir, but the story is decent. Unfortunately, the print Alpha used is jumpy, quite worn, and the transfer has too much contrast in it. It's not likely a better version will pop up, however.Walter Brennan has a small role as a frustrated waiter in an early film appearance."
3,"the Monogram ""quickie"" at it's height","Sparky and entertaining little roadshow feature from Monogram which doesn't wear out it's welcome. Marion Burns plays a society cutie called Dale Jordan who boards a cruiseliner headed for Panama. Once in the city she gets a job as a cabaret singer. She and her ballsy gal-pal Jerry (Arline Judge) wow the crowds with their act before getting fired. Dale falls in love with a doomed millionaire airman and Jerry is almost killed in a barfight before the film rushes to it's brisk conclusion.Alpha's DVD offers a badly-worn print, littered with jumps in picture and sound (though it's a miracle we have this film on DVD at all). Nevertheless this is the Monogram 'quickie' at it's height and film collectors will get a big kick out of it."
2,This is BAD if you have GOOD pictures!,"I got this frame as a gift. As noted in another review, the documentation is all of 1 page, barely readable and just about useless. I called the 800 Tech support # and, again as noted in other reviews, you get a voicemail asking for your number for a return call. I persevered by going to their website , getting their office phone # and calling. I was told they were very busy with a lot of calls. I asked how many people they had answering calls in tech support and was told 2!!! I finally did speak to a tech who informed me that my pictures were too high quality and that's why it took many minutes (instead of seconds) to switch between slides. My camera takes 7.2 megapixel pictures and I was told that unless I re-size them and copy them on to a memory card (i.e. make them lesser quality) then the problem would persist. I would strongly suggest trying this product out with your memory card at the store before purchasing."
1,NuVue 560 does NOT support images it claims,"I got a NuVue 560 as a gift, and am very disappointed in the total lack of customer support, and it clearly does not perform as described in the documentation. Stay away from this one unless you have very low resolution jpeg."
4,"Pictures look ok, but no USB and no TV out!","The description and the box says it has a USB 2.0 connection for fast transfer with included cable and a video out for TV viewing with cable. However, it has none of these connections nor cables! Our camera uses a different memory card (smartmedia) not supported by this product, so we have to figure out another way to get the photos from our computer onto the SD memory card supported by this product. If these interfaces are not required (and we probably won't need them once we figure a way to get photos onto the card), then the frame is a good way to showcase your digital photo collection."
1,doesn't work at all,"We received this as a gift. It worked ONLY the first time I used it. It has nothing to do with picture quality or size either. I have a Canon EOS Rebel 6.1 SRR camera (very large files). I took some pictures, and it worked, although image quality was quite poor. Of course, you won't really want to take some photos to use. You'll want to BUY ANOTHER MEMORY CARD, further expense, and copy some good photos to it for use in the digital frame. I did this and now it won't read any cards at all. I even reformated one of my memory cards, took new photos and inserted the card. Still won't read them. Don't waste your money. I'm asking for the receipt so that I can return it to the store. By the way, almost NEVER write really bad reviews, but this product is truly awful."
1,"No documentation, no support, dead on arrival","Picture frame looks good, but does not work. Card reader did not read any cards. Only has a 2-page documentation. 800-number at a website only have a voice mail box, but nobody ever calls back or returns e-mail."
3,Hank Locklin: Send me the Pillow You Deam On/ 48 Golden Memories,"A notable omission is the only thing which keeps this from being a great buy. Still, you get 40 great cuts for aboutA noteworthy omission is the only thing which keeps this from being a great collection. Still you get 48 great cuts for about $18. I am glad I bought it and that is the bottom line for any music purchase."
4,helpful book,This book expresses the many complicated feelings that pregnant teenagers go through in a realistic way.
4,Well pleased!,This is a very good book for heart patients. Offers some creative and different options for meals. Looking forward to trying some of these recipes.
3,Heart healthy recipes,"I bought this cookbook to get ideas for heart healthy recipes. I would say it does meet that need. However, for me these recipes are a ""starting point"" - some are pretty bland unless you add additional spices or herbs. Not one of my ""go-to"" cookbooks, but I do use it occasionally."
5,User Friendly and Informative,Easy to follow recipes with a reasonable number of ingredients. Comes with complete menus and lots of information and tips about eating for heart health. A well designed cookbook and a useful tool for healthy living.
5,Betty Crocker Healthy Heart Cookbood,"Easy to understand, beautiful pictures, nutritional values for each recipe."
5,Have had no problems,I have had this drive for about nine months and it has not failed me once. I have connected it to a few different laptops and a server and all were able to read and write to it with no problem. I don't have any systems with firewire yet so I just use the USB. I use this for shared storage as well as storing and running several vmware server vitual machines. It has always performed like a champ. I use this at work and it has become the place to go to get and store files and applications for many people within MIS.
1,Do Not Buy,"I got this drive for Christmas 06. It is May 07 and it is dead. It was nice when it worked and fast too. But the drive just quit working. I sent it for warranty work, but guess what? Seagate bought Maxtor and is honoring the warranty. It is hard to navigate Maxtor stuff on Seagate's website because it doesn't support a lot of Maxtor's old stuff. I got an RMA from Seagate for a refurbed drive of the same kind. The new drive worked once and then died. It's still at Seagate as we speak. Its a hassle. I have all maxtor internal drives in my computers and love them. I hate this one. I'd recommend Maxtor to anyone but they are not around anymore.Don't buy any leftover Maxtor stuff on the shelves that are overstock, or you'll have to deal with poor Seagate staff trying to phase out the stuff."
2,Arrived Broken,"Very cute, however very bad packing, and then was thrown in a bigger box with no packing materials. Too bad."
2,Never had a chance to use it,"This set looks great, very stylish, but I never got a chance to use it as one of the pieces was broken when I got it. I'm not sure if it was broken before Amazon shipped it to me, but it was clear that it was due to the manafacturer packing the item poorly. The two pieces for each warmer were stacked on top of each other with just a small, thin square of foam between them. If they ever change the way they pack the boxes, I'm sure it would be a great item to have.Kudos to Amazon for working with me to get me a refund instantly so I could order something else for my crab feed in 5 days!"
3,"Ok if you've never touched a bike, worthless if you've taken the MSF course already.","This book is essentially the expanded version of the booklet they give you at the MSF Basic Rider's Course. As such, I found nothing useful in it. It would be a great book to read before you take the class, though. I was looking for strategies on braking and cornering in various conditions, but what I got was just a listing of road conditions, not what to do about them. It mentions the different types of skids, but not how to recover from them. I guess they want us to have to take their Advanced class..."
4,Very nice book for begginers!,"For beginners riders is the book to start.We are living in Brazil and because distance, we couldn't make the courses.I think they could prepare a REAL COURSE using videos (may be throght YOUTUBE)and evaluate the candidates by internet-based courses or pupils could send them videos showing how they are driving. Only was out-of-the-box idea!"
4,Review of The Motorcycle Safety Foundation Guide to Motorcycling Excellence (2nd Edition),This is a great book for beginning motorcycle riders. It provides motorcycling details that should make a new rider comfortable in learning how to ride. It's also a good refresher for people that have been riding a motorcycle for a while.
2,Can be helpful if never driven a car or bicycle in traffic,"There are much words but the helpful information one can get from this book is suprisingly small. If you have driven a car or bicycle in traffic and taken a physics course in a high school, then it seems to me that the parts of helpful information to you would be only a couple of pages long.Also I feel the physics or logics described in this book is suspicious in its validity or at least its explanation is not complete in some cases.Quite disappointed and not recommended unless your are in the case of this review title."
5,Excellent Reading For Anyone,"I'm new at riding a motorcycle on the street. I can pretty much get on any bike and run it through the gears, but not with very much street experience. This book is pretty much common sence, but it includes many things that a new rider should read about before an encounter with another vehicle and learn the hard way. This book is a great book to just have around and review every once in a while. It will help keep you on your toes. Anything you can use to help you be safe on the road is worth taking a look at. For the price of this book, why not read it and share it with your riding buddies."
4,"Great Book, Great service","The Book was recieved quickly, and in excellent condition. Its a great read, full of information for even the most advanced riders. You can never be too safe. Every day we ride we learn something new. Great book."
5,Study it! just don't read it.,"Some books you read and some you study with a highlighter in hand. The Motorcycling Excellence from the Motorcycle Safety Foundation is such a book it reads more like field manual for the two wheeled warrior on the road, I bought a HD Sporster and riding a bike in Korea is a challenge but this book has brought to light many strategies that have been a great help. Whether you are a new rider or Vet, this book will help you get your mind right before you get into the saddle. If you are a new rider take the MSF Basic course, do you want to listen to the guys who got it right or the guys who got it wrong? Have a safe ride arm yourself with knowledge."
3,Lots of words but insufficient content.,"I am an intermediate motorcycle rider. I was hoping this book would provide a great deal of useful information for someone at my level.The book was well written and obviously professionally produced. But as someone once said about one of Mozart's Operas....""too many"" notes (words in this case). I believe the book could be ""slimmed down"" considerably, maybe to a pocket book size.I learned some things. I particularly liked the explanation of the scinetific whys and hows of steering a motorcycle. I obviously had been living with a misconception for more years than I would like to admit.I recommend this book, but with reservations. To my taste, too many words and not enough content. Kudos to the Motorcycle Safety Foundation for its work regardless."
5,MSF Guide to M/C Excellence,An invaluable tool for the beginner; an excellent review for the seasoned rider. Full of useful tips; phenominal safe-riding resource. I srongly recommend this book.
5,New Riders should take the time to read this one.,This book is very informative for new riders. There are many more things that a motorcycle rider should know to protect themselves while on the road. Most people do not even consider that there are motorcycles on the rode. It is up to the rider to be informed on aspects of safe riding and to protect themselves from inattentive car drivers. This book outlines some of the hazards and proper riding technics.
4,Good for beginers,"Great book for absolute beginers who has never ridden a bike before.Only teaches basic skills and helps you pick out a first bike, gear etc.Also points out what to look for in city trafic, in turns , or passing cars, objects."
4,Great book for someone returning to motorbikes,"If, like me, you are returning to motor bikes after a very long absence, or are new to motorbikes, this book can help you to arrive alive and enjoy the ride. It's is an easy read and goes into some depth on why motor bikes act the way they do and what you can do to stay out of trouble. I particularly liked the sections on how to approach intersections (many strategies provided), counter steering (I now understand it much better) and traction (you need to ride so that you always have traction in reserve). Worthwhile book regardless if you ride on the left (as in Australia) or right side of the road."
5,Motorcycle Safety Foundations's Guide,Excellent book for Motorcycle safety information for beginning and experienced riders. Would highly recommend it for all interested riders that want to catch up on the latest rider safety information.
3,To0iCy,"The model is okay, the scale is too small for me so the details on it is not that well done but it's alright. I won't buy this again, I'll buy a larger (1/100) scale of this model next time."
3,Not secure or sturdy,It's OK at fastening 2 sheets together. Anything else and it's too loose and comes apart too fast. Mine broke after using it less than 20 times.
3,Intruiging little gadget,"This product is a really neat little thing. It cuts a slit in one side of the paper, and then cuts another slice of paper and feeds that into the slit. The device is simple and fun to use. Overall I'd say it's a novel device, but the reliability of it to hold paper together isn't as nice as I had hoped. Don't expect this to 100% replace staples. I use it for personal documents and stuff I can afford to misplace or let get disorganized. For term papers/homework assignments good 'ol fashion staple is the way to go. That being said, for the price it's totally worth it. Very cool invention."
1,didn't work,This was a neat idea... idea's are more common than earlobes.It just doesn't work.Wasn't worth the cost and effort to get a refund.Too bad.
3,Like the 12 step plans,It's very easy to read and would probably help some of those who can adhere to these plan types. It wasn't anything new.
2,Overeater's Anonymous is not a diet program,"The description of this book, submitted by the publisher, is ""The inspirational diet program for followers of Overeaters Anonymous.' OA is a 12-step program, not a ""diet program."" Anyone who wants to understand OA should a) go a meeting in your area and listen; b) enter ""Overeaters Anonymous"" in their search engine and look at the organization's site, and/or c) read ""The Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions of Overeaters Anonymous"", the core ""text"" of the program.The Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions of Overeaters Anonymous"
4,It'll do...,"Oster 3883 Belgian Wafflemaker, ChromeThis waffle maker does a good job although I'm not certain why an adjustable temp. knob is necessary...Waffles only come out good if it's turned up all the way anyway, so there's no point in making it adjustable...Secondly, although they say you're waffle is done when there's no more steam, you really don't know HOW done it is unless you actually open it and look...Fortunately, after I used it a few times I discovered that mine were done at 4 min, so now I just set a timer for 4 min...Too bad it simply doesn't beep or have a lite that goes on in 4 min...Other than those two criticisms, it's a decent wafflemaker, so I'll give it 4 stars out of 5"
1,BEWARE ! OVERHEATING - POSSIBLE FIRE HAZARD!!!,I bought this waffle make plugged it in made a couple unevenly cooked waffles. Then noticed the heat was way too high . Waffle maker was crackling with excess heat till some of the teflone came off in our waffles. Return this unit rather than risk burning your house down. I am also contacting the manufacturer to let them know. I cant wait to find out which Chinese factory produces this little gem. PS Does not deserve a star but had to give minimum one star to post a review.
1,Worst waffles I have ever eaten!,"I have cooked many waffles and used many waffle makers in my time. This one is by far the worst. I followed the directions to the point (not that it matters because I have made so many waffles that I can do it without thinking). I tried changing the ratios of ingredients and even used multiple types of mix including some of the best mixes you can buy (even tried one ""just add water"" mix which was the worst of all) to compensate. No matter what I did, these waffles came out unevenly cooked and rubbery every time. Even for the cheap price point, I would never reccomend this iron. We plan to return it tomorrow."
5,Pleased!,"For the price of this waffle iron, I am very pleased. I've had good experiences with Oster products in the past and this one has not been a disappointment. It heats up pretty quickly and cooks the waffles evenly and relatively quickly--or at least no longer than my last waffle iron. I'm accustomed to cooking my waffles for 8 to 9 minutes. I don't really pay attention to the machine's timing mechanism: I just use my regular kitchen timer. I think the waffle iron looks really nice. It's small and doesn't take up too much space. Everyone loved the waffles I made in them so I'm giving it 5 stars. I just hope it keeps working for years to come."
3,Bought 3 1/2 months ago,"This unit makes good waffles. My mom likes the compact size and chrome body. Unfortunately, the small plastic plate that covers the wiring on the bottom crumbled off. There is some melting around the screws that held the plate in place. Kinda cheap, but I only paid $20 at Amazon about 14 weeks ago. The unit still works and I plan to duck tape the wire house shut. If we get another 3-4 months use I should be satisfied with this disposable waffle maker. When I made the purchase I was expecting about one year of use."
2,Poorly made,This product is junk. It worked 10 times then the switch broke. I chucked it and bought waffle plates for my Cuisinart griddle. That seems to be working much better.
5,"you CAN have it good, cheap & fast!","For under $20 this is an awesome product. If you want the giant, deep waffles that you get from a restaurant at home, you can spend over $500 for a commercial waffler. If you just want good waffles fast & cheap, get this one. Adding some malted milk powder to your batter may also give you the restaurant-quality taste that you seek.I set mine on med/high - after only about 2 minutes the ready light comes on. I use 1/2 cup of batter & cook undisturbed for 4 minutes. Perfect waffles every time & ready light recovers quickly for the next waffle. When I make a big batch for freezing, I cook only 3 minutes each, this way they won't burn when I toast them right out of the freezer."
2,nonstick?,"I bought this waffle iron about 6 months ago. We make waffles almost every morning. After about 2 months I needed to spray Pam every time I used it. Now, even with Pam, I can't get an entire waffle out. It usually comes out in about 5 or 6 sections. I'm ordering the Villaware that Alton recommends. I've loved every other tool he's recommended, so I am hoping that this will be the same."
4,Oster 3883 Belgian Wafflemaker,The product is everything it claimed to be. We have used it several times and are satisfied with the results. The price was excellent compared to what we saw it on sale for in a department store.
5,Fabulous appliance I would buy all over again,"Oster 3883 Belgian Wafflemaker, ChromeWe used it for the first time tonight. The waffles are amazing! Fluffy and light (like I like 'em) or a nice golden brown crunch (like the kids like 'em). It warmed up fast. After the first waffle, the iron pumped the waffles out very quickly. We look forward to many more meals using the Oster 3883!"
4,Our first waffle maker and it works very well,"We got this about 2 months back. I was looking for one that would be reasonably priced and work well.Right from the first time we tried it we had yummy homemade waffles.... It takes a couple of tries to get the right amount in. If you put in too much it can overflow ... so when you first put it in go easy. Th batter should be the right consistency. We usually make waffles with the dial at ""Max"" so that its more brown. The only oil I use is some that I spray very lightly on the 2 sides of the waffles maker. No oil in my batter unless the mix already has any fat.Now I can make healthy waffles with fresh grated apple, chopped bananas, blueberries etc.I have had no sticking problems that some other users have mentioned."
3,okay for a cheap waffle maker,"This waffle maker takes some trial and error before maximizing its potential. Most importantly, don't be shy with the temperature control. At first, I didn't want to burn the waffles, but don't worry about that. I tried and tried to make crispy waffles, but kept getting softer ones. You have to put it on MAX temperature setting, and let it get good and hot before cooking. Then, I found that it takes at least 7-8 minutes to cook a waffle thoroughly and to a crisp. Also, this waffle iron does tend to cook unevenly, so I flip and let it cook another minute the other way. I have not had significant sticking problems, but I spray the iron with PAM before each waffle. For really tasty waffles, put a tablespoon or two of cinnamon sugar spice in the batter (for a large batch). This waffle maker is okay for now, but I'll probably invest in a good flip-over type waffle maker that gets hotter and cooks more quickly."
1,Bad experience,"I added this as a backup to an older Oster that works great, and have been very disappointed with this one. It takes 10+ minutes to make a bad waffle. Perhaps it isn't working properly. Not sure."
2,Warhol review,The film was dated and focused more on Warhol's life as filmmaker than as an artist. I needed the film for my HS art class and found it tedious and somewhat inappropriate for students.
2,Not the best,"There are some gems in this book. For example, I liked how the author demonstrates how to use the shell modifier in 3dMax 6. This is a new feature and the tutorial attempts to demonstrate its use. Only problem is that the turorial is not easy to follow as many are not. The author fails to include examples of the different stages of modeling. You get the begining 3d model on cd and the final version (in some cases). However, it would be nice to show a model in different steps of completion. Overall, many tutorials suffer because of this. The still life tutorial was a dissapointment. 3d max comes with a better tutorial that is more realistic and impressive. The best tutorial is the character animation tutorial. However, this character looks weird. The worst character I have ever seen. Not the best book on 3d max with black and white diagrams, poorly sequenced tutorials and instruction that leaves much to be desired."
4,Good Shoe,"The shoe has a quality finish, looks great, and comfy when worn. However not too flexible, causing discomfort when kneeling etc..."
1,BAD RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX,"Bought this set and two days later the impact driver went out... I had a problem returning it because the stores sell out of the sets so fast that you cannot find a place to return it: and on top of that you have to return the whole set! This was a very time consuming process that i hope does not have to be repeated.On top of this, when i was at the local dewalt service center trying to get this sorted out, they got two other calls from people with the same problem! I really like dewal tools, but since about three years ago, i feel that their quality has really gone down. the first drill i ever bought is still going strong today... the second was bad right out of the box and now this 600 dollar set is acting up... this will be the last time i will ever buy dewalt!"
2,Half price is too high!,I only buy recon Dewalt. 50% off MSP is still too high. I like Dewalt BUT Dewalt is only Black & Decker's premium tool. It doesn't compare with Milwaukee or some of the other brands. It's a mid class power tool.
2,sweet smell of burning coils,"If you have to work with these tools at work you are going to get mad. Not enough guts, power and battery life. I find that Hilti is what works best in the trades.These tools are nice to have at home for your wife and kids to play with.I have smelt the burnt coils of many of these XRP tools. Go Hilti if you don't want to mess around.These tools are nothing but black and decker tools with yellow plastic on them.The flashlight is worthless too."
3,garbage to be or garabage for sure,"I had purchased a similar set recently and have had similar issues with the quality of dewalt products. I have dead batteries and switches that stick or click due to misalignment and a reciprocating saw that has now mutated to a 2 piece unit after a bout with 14 guage sheetmetal(needless to say there is no way to fix a broken screw for a feasible repair, the plastic body actually fractured!!)I have around 10 dewalt pieces with 18v batts. and am considering a full retreat from my existing armory and a milwaukee conversion. You know cut my losses for the future. Wake up R&D for Dewalt!!"
2,Dead Recip Saw,Bought in June 2005. REcip saw died today (jan 06) very limited use. Hopefully the other tools will last a bit longer. After reading other reviews not even going to bother trying to get replacement.
4,Welcome Home Jellybean,This is a cool book. Welcome Home Jellybean is about a family that goes to pick up their 14 year old daughter who is mentally challenged. She comes home and lots of funny and bad things happen. My favorite part is when she pushes a red button in an elevator. Read the book to find out all the exciting things that happen to Gerri. FOUR STARS *****by Marion
4,Welcome Home Jellybean,"Wow! I could just scream to the whole world how good Welcome Home Jellybean was. It's mainly about a boy named Neil and his family who decide to bring his mentally challanged sister , Gerri, home. Neil realizes that he is going to have some rough times now since Gerri is home. Gerri does some awful stuff to Neil. This book is exciting and is kind of predictable. I also think it deserves a four out of five stars.by Allie"
4,GREAT book!,"I thought that Welcome Home, Jellybean was an excellent book. I couldn't stop reading it! I really like how at the end of each chapter the author made it so you wanted to keep reading and reading. It is about a girl who is mentally challenged and she comes home. The family, especially Neil, has to adapt to Geraldine's(the mentally challenged girl) special needs. I would tell everyone to read it."
3,This book is great!!!!,"Neil Oxley's older sister, Geraldine, is coming home for the first time. After spending most of her life in an institution for most retarded people, she is finally going to live with her family and get used to the family life and life outside of a instition.Find out what happens your self."
2,Welcome Home Jellybean,"Not so great... This book is about a boy named Neil and his mentally challenged sister, Gerri. It isn't very funny. It is kind of sad though, like when Neil's dad packs up and leaves. He takes Neil's and Grandpa's pictures with him, and leaves Gerri's pictures behind. It isn't the best book I'ver ever read, but it's kind of good. I don't recommend it.by Matt D."
4,THIS BOOK IS GREAT!,"WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS BOOK I WAS SAYING TO MYSELF ""THIS IS BOOK IS GOING TO BE BORING""BUT REALIZED IT WAS A BIOGRAPHY OF FAMILYS WHO DEAL WITH THIS STUFF. AND I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK."
2,Welcome Home Jellybean,"Not so great... This book is about a boy named Neil and Hismentally challenged sister, Gerri. It isn't very funny. It is kindof sad though. It isn't the best book I've ever read, but it's kind of good. I don't recommend it. END"

5,Women Rebels,"In doing research for my book in progress on women resisters to authority in the 19th century, I ran across this charming book. It really encourages young people to think for themselves and stand up for what they believe. It includes a few women you've heard of, such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Clara Barton, and some you may not have heard of, such as Phyllis Wheatley and Ernestine Rose. All these women were incredibly brave and suffered because of their beliefs. The book also encourages children to think about the ideas of justice for all and equal rights. For girls, it provides excellent role models; for boys, encouragement to think of females as people who can be brave and courageous. The illustrations by Deanne Hollinger are exquisite. I love this book!"
2,"""spin"" is literal","The sound on these speakers is fine, but then again so are most PC speakers.The problem is that they are really, really tippy! Barely breathing on them will make them fall over. And if you want to turn them on, adjust the volume, or plug in headphones, it'll have to be with your other hand securely holding the speaker, because you will tip them over. They're the most unstable speakers I've ever used."
2,don't buy them,"1. You can't turn the volume all the way down! Even when the knob is all the way over to the left, you can still hear sound. Sucks when you need to take a call.2. They're really wobbly and fall over easily.On the plus side, there is a jack for the microphone on the right one, which a lot of similar speakers don't have."

5,Packed with sentiment,I downloaded this album mainly to get the song 'Aloha oe' in German which I love. After playing all the songs in the album I was not sorry that I got the complete album instead of just that one song individually. Jimmy Makulis has a remarkable voice and he puts a lot of sentiment in his songs. He is one of the best romantic singers out there. His music sung in German sounds quite exotic because of his foreign accent.These songs makes you wish you could go to a tropical island on your next vacation. Maybe fall in love with a Hula girl...
1,Completely USELESS. Don't waste your money!,"These screw-on filters have -0- effect on shower stream water.Don't fall for marketing, and ""peace of mind feeling"" once you screw it on.Small filters like that have no ability to filter own Chlorine, and they are completely useless for Chloramine.You need a 5-feet tall filter with 12-inch diameter to have any reasonable Chloramine filtering.AVOID, and don't waste your money."
2,useless,We have fairly heavy water in Chicago and its highly chlorinated. This filter does not make much of a difference as far as I can tell
5,Fixed My Problems,The original cable guard did not go far enough to keep veins from hitting the cables plus the old cable guard would come loose from time to time. The Z-Rod fixed my problems.
2,The Dud Ranch,"If I had known that this video had been edited, I would never have purchased it. It was very annoying having voice overs for numerous words they deemed inappropriate."
1,Avoid At All Costs,"Don't believe the description of this turkey of a film. There's more sexuality in a copy of Vogue. This is a ""3 AM on a free movie channel"" type of story, with poor production value, a ludicrous film script, and even worse acting. Now, you've been forewarned."
5,Not what you think.,This movie is not what you think it is about. I was rather dissapointed in watching it. It is a topless movie only.
2,Penelope,"Excuse me, Uncut - Unrated. You can actually watch it with your teenagers without guilt. It's a cute movie, but the title is misleading. The sex is simulated, if you could call it sex. Sue Ellen did more with J R. The actresses are nice looking and there is a movie here. It depends on what you're looking for. I was didappointed, but I watched anyway. I'll probably watch it again in life. It's not an errotic sex flick.Captioning??"
3,"Oh, well","If you like raunchy,stupid funny, this is the movie for you. I like funny, and stupid funny, but this is not one for the whole family."
2,ok movie!!!(women way too old),"I like the overall concept of this movie. It actually gives you a take of the life style that you experience when you go to Vegas. Now, what I did not like was the fact that the actors (women), age range seem to be from 35-50 years old. I think that the movie would have been a lot better if they used actors from 25-35. Other than that, it's a pretty good film."
1,mainstream at it best,This is not really movie its kinda something to waste your time between Friday and Sunday. It has two speeds-slow and really slow. I never judge acting but term wooden is pretty close. Chicks-between ugly and very ugly and no skin whatsoever so its more appropriate to call this flick--life in monastery.On a top of all nonsense there is no feel of real life its kinda imagined universe by mainsteam media. Bbrrrr.
3,some social content,"In a movie that seems aimed at sexual interestsis found some social conscience.There seem to be two sections of the population thatare not very happy in life.1) single women without careers or a futureand whose sexual services are in demand2) single men who can't make in life, with no futurewho can't afford a wifeSociety hasn't been easy on them.Loneliness and isolation in modern society isn't well dealt with.That whore houses are an antithesis to the puritan forefathersand the Christan religious righthasn't made them disappear.Sociologically for the prostitutes the ""house"" set up is safer.Psychologically for the male such houses seem to serve a purposeas well.I think the laws should not make sin a crime unless someone is being hurt by the sin.Prostitutes are people and have very definite sociologicaland psychological problems that aren't being answered well in our society."
2,boo zero,"this movies was not good at all. do not buy this. I was excpecting this to be good and fun and it was nothing but dumb, lame and boring."
3,Buy the Unrated Version,This movie is a pretty good B-list movie. the plot is not half bad and it kept me entertained. now there are two versions of this movie. the R rated one and the unrated uncut edition. the R rated one censors language and all the nudity. some of the diaologe does not make sence beign cencored. the Uncencored edition is the one to buy. the language makes the movie better and funnier. the nudity also makes this movie a little easier for a guy to watch it. in seeing both versions (cause i rented the R version first) the unrated version is alot better. and if you are someone that does not like the nudity and the language this movie is not something you would want to see.
3,rather boring: not erotic; unrated/uncut is deceptive hype,"This is not an erotic movie, just a movie-documentary that did not interest me much.HBO's Cathouse is more interesting and erotic.The movie Live Nude Girls is more fun and sexy."
1,A Must Read Review,"Don't even bother reading the back of the DVD cover. This is not your typical sex comedy/drama/real life story. There is no nudity, no profanity, no happy ending, and it is a waste of rental money. The women are only worth looking at when there is a 'lineup' in front of a customer.Take me seriously. Don't take me seriously. It's your money."
1,Lets be real,Ok be for real the only reason i got this was cause i thought it would be the same as the TV show the cathouse. NOOOOO its nothing like that and it has horrible acting with a cheap scene of showing moral.
1,no good,"next time i buy something i will check first, i haven't been able to watch my dvd, because i am in the wrong region, i suppose you learn by your mistakes."
5,Good battery for the price.,Bought this battery to have an extra one when the original is charging and the performance are comparable with the one that comes with the camera.
4,Great for the price,"When I first bought this battery, based on the price I thought it was a one time use battery. The back of the box even states ""dispose of used battery pack promptly"". However I thought I'd try charging it and it took charge. It does not last as long as the cannon battery that came with my SX230 HS but it does work. I take a lot of video with my camera and I usually have one battery on charge while using the other. I thought about buying a more expensive battery to get longer life but decided that for just a little over 2 bucks I could buy several of these. I would definately recommend to a freind."
5,Great Batteries for Canon NB 5L,I purchased these after market batteries to use on a trip. I have been testing them so far and they all work just as long as the original OEM batteries. I can take about 300 photos without using the flash or about 250 photos with using the flash sometimes. Great buy.
2,Very short life,"Granted, I did not expect much for the price a paid for these batteries (I bought two). We got them before the holidays and charged them up. Both batteries only lasted for a night or two of holiday photo taking before dying. Maybe 30-40 photos each. I am obviously looking for more life than this. This wasn't even close to the life of the OEM battery. I waited to try both batteries before I did a review and they are identical. They do work... just not for very long."
5,Very Satisfied,Product as described. Works as good as the Cannon battery for 1/10 the price. I'm getting ready to order another for my SX230HS.
3,Very interesting rating...,"Item description says 1200mAh, First picture shows 1300mAh, second and third picture shows 1400mAh! Very interesting battery rating! There is another similar item by same seller for same price but no battery rating."
3,It's More Flimsy than Flexible,This product is so flimsy that it bends under the weight of a chicken tender. I'd be afraid to try and move or pick up a fish with it.
4,Great fish turner for smaller pieces,I've had this for quite awhile and use it every time I make fish. It works great as it is very thin and flexible which helps it glide right under the fish. Only downside is that it can sag under the weight of larger pieces.
4,I'M NOT IN TEXAS BUT WISH I WAS SOMETIMES,"I bought this CD at the urging of a friend of mine, Bud Brewer, who had played music with Will Barnes in the past. I had no idea what I was getting but after receiving the CD and playing it in my pickup truck I really enjoyed the music and the words to the songs."
2,Not what it claims to be....,"The subtitle of this book is what caused me to buy it. ""A Christian woman's guide to mentoring teenage girls."" I had been asked by a young woman in our church to mentor her through our 'coming of age' program and was seeking some resources, as I had never done it before. This book is really more of a memoir than a guidebook... and frankly, it is just terrible. The author has many years of experience, it is true, but never gives any nuts and bolts advice. Instead she wanders around the subject, throwing in seemingly unimportant annecdotes and stories. It is really, in my opinion, poorly written. But, for me, the biggest issue is that I didn't get any advice on mentoring my teen friend. My brief experience with mentoring shows that teens can be deeply spiritual beings. Instead of talking about ways to help a teen develop her spirituality, the author talks about having make-up parties and overnight social retreats. It was a waste of money."
4,Good,This had some very useful ideas and some things that you should always keep in mind when dealing with teenage girls. I learned a lot.
4,good product,I bought this for my home computer running ubuntu .it works great for burning images and different oporating systems.plug and play.had no problems at all.
4,The smart writing speed adjustment is cool,"Ever bought a memorex 40mmx 1248AJ, but its reading capability is terrible. It even can not read the disc written by itself easily (very very hard). Exchanged a 48mmx 2448 with more [money], everything seems good. I like the feature that it can adjust the writing speed according to the data transfer rate (e.g., if you write at 48x, but if the computer can not deliver such a high data rate, the drive will force a lower writing speed such as 24x). This feature is better than the one that the drive waits till the buffer is refilled (the 40mmx 1248AJ does this. This is also a good feature, but due to that the laser power density is not adjusted accoringly, the disc written looks very funny).Still looking for a 24x CDRW disc. Does anybody know where can find the 24x cdrw disc?"
3,fair stuff but at this price......,"I am a fan of Billy and went for this collection. As many do, I love the double sax sound and here you start having it in cd4 out of 6, so it is a disappointment. All early recordings are with a ""common"" sound that is not particularly attractive. When the double sax come in of course the story is different, 2 and half cds of double sax entertainment. I can easy do without the strings of Billy when I think of Mantovani, Faith or Franck Pourcel, not to mention David Rose and Paul Mauriat and some others too. In the end I would advise to go for the now widely available double sax sound cds all over and leave this one out, incidentally with this price gone over the roof."
5,Pleasantly Surprised!,I just finished going through this book and must say that I'm pleasantly surprised by how much I learned and how quickly I learned it.The value of the lessons taught in this book were evident a few days after I completed the last exercise when I created my own project. Went without a hitch.Top Notch!
1,"UNSATISFIED CUSTOMER ""RIP OFF""","I PAID FOR THIS ITEM, 6/12/ PER THE ORDER FORM IT WOULD BE THREE WEEKS BEFORE I RECEIVED THE ITEM. I WAS UNABLE TO TRACK BECAUSE THERE WAS NO TRACKING NBR WHEN I WENT TO VIEW. THEN SINCE JULY 7TH WAS THE LASTED DATED STATED I SHOULD GET IT. I EMAIL THE COMPANY ADVISING THEM I HAD NOT GOTTEN THE MERCHINDISE AND THEY REFUSE TO SEND REFUND MY MONEY NOR SEND OUT A NEW ONE, IT WAS TOLD IN EMAIL I WOULD HAVE TO RE-PURCHASE. I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY OR PROBABLY AMAZON AS WELL."
1,won't read in that there is a battery,won't read in that there is a battery in my macbook pro ofter 2 months it gets a lot hotter than my other battery did
3,An exciting but undetailed book,"When you get lost in northern Canada what do you do? This was the problem faced by Gabe Rogers. Gabe is an average 15 year old boy, but when Gabe goes on a sight seeing trip the plane won't start when they land to see Virginia Falls. Then the rope breaks and the plane goes tumbleing over the falls! Now in need of food, Gabe and his friend, Raymond, must find food and shelter to survive.The book is exciting but not very detailed. It is also hard to believe that the tempature could go under -60 degrees farenhiet. This book is definitely not deserving of a National Book Award. I would rate it a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10. I would also not recomend it to anyone."
5,Very Good,"I had trouble putting this book down to see what kind of trouble the characters get into. Liked the descriptions of the far north, and would recommend to anyone."
5,THE MOST ADVENTUROUS BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY LIFE!!!,The way the book was written it made me feel like I was in the book. And it has an adventurous and daring and most of the time dangerous stunt performed in every page. I would highly recommend this book. It has changed the way I think and feel about nature and human beings; what we can do to help.
1,What is this thing?,"I received this book as a gift, which is the only reason it's not in a trash can right now. People are paying $17 for a bunch of recycled photos, only 40 or so of which portray Jesse James, along with a few hundred words of unreadable text? This is the ""authorized"" biography? Is the man's life so horrible that no one could write about it? Frankly, this book is an insult to Jesse's fans. If you want to read about Jesse, buy ""Jesse James: The Man and His Machines,"" by Mike Seate."
2,More balls than bikes,"I was a bit disappointed in this book. I did like the bike photos that were shown... not many. Lots of filler of Jesse and his gang posing with guns. What looks like porn stars on the bikes.... I would rather just see the bikes man. I don't need to see pictures of Jesse playing tough guy holding a shotgun or burning money. Or his freaking dog dish with the WCC logo on it... my god. It makes you wonder what he is trying to make up for. His bikes are cool. They need to show more of them. And the text is pretty much a joke too... F this and F that. Its like a big kiss up to Jesse as a bike god or something and F the rest of you. If you pay full price for this book, you deserve to get beat down by Jesse."
1,what a looser,"I too recieved the book as a gift. We read it, we laughed, we used it for target pratice. Seems he left out the part about the crank and the fat chicks in NYC."
2,Who is the real Jesse James?,"I am a big fan of Monster Garage and of Jesse James. I bought this book after reading The Man and His Machines thinking it would provide an insight into who Jesse is and some details about his life and his struggles. The photo's of the bikes are great but I have seen those same photo's over and over again. I expected to see more photo's of Jesse. I also expected it would be a more autobiographical book, not something I needed a magnifying glass to read and finished within the hour. Jesse needs to release a true autobiography. His fans would love it."
5,Griller Quartet only did one Beethoven,"I bought this for my Father. He is a fan of Beethoven's work and had the Griller Quartet on record saying it was the best version on No.15 ever made. He goes to concerts and listens to Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin and the others anytime they are offered. He knows better than anyone else that I have met, which are the better String Quartets to listen to. I have heard it and they are very good, each note is played perfectly with pride."
3,Fine book with a notable exception,"As an overview of the philosophy of sport from Egypt and Ancient Greece to the present time, this is a fine volume. But it is breathtaking that in a review of the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich the author saw fit to recall ""Notable"" performances in track and field events, gymnastics, swimming and more and yet managed to leave out the most notable and historic contest of all: the gold medal basketball game between Russia and the United States. This was the United States' first ""loss,"" since basketball's inclusion in 1936, though they were swindled out of their gold after officials put time back on the clock on three consecutive occasions.In a spirit of solidarity and righteous indignation the American team refused to accept their silver medals.How can this episode--which is arguably the greatest instance of official biasin sports history--not be recognized in an objective history of this sort?Ken Shouler"
3,Text book,Book was slightly beat up and almost every page had text that was highlighted by previous owner but its used. Also was the cheapest I could find online listed as used.
4,Super Secure,"This lock is awesome, will keep your bike very safe, probably cannot be stolen, however it is very heavy, about 10lbs. I still like it a lot though,; gives me great peace of mind even when I'm in the city."
1,trust the reviews. Lock is bad.,I bought this lock about 3 mos ago. Its a pretty tough chain/lock but I had the same problem as others. One day the key wouldn't go all the way in and the lock refused to open. Lucky it was not attached to my motor scooter or it would have been a b*&^h to get it off. I had it attached to the grate of my apartment building and it finally gave it self up. I took it off and locked and opened it again unattached to anything. Can't get the key in again. Not trusting it again. I went to OnGuARD'S web site and it's not even listed. So much for support.Forget this thing. Consider yourself warned.
5,Favorite Book of All Time,This book was given to me as a small child. I loved it then and I still love it now. I make it a point to reread it every year or so. Now my children get to hear it read and they love it too. I just found out that there is a second book called The Silver Nutmeg. I would love for these books to be rereleased in the original splendor. They capture the imagination and help it to soar.
3,Grab a used copy if you can find one.,"Amazon.com located my copy for me, so don't give up hope of obtaining one. Don't let the word ""Illustration"" in the title scare you off if you are an aspiring artist with an interest in these topics. Ted Wilbur's introduction is encouraging and insightful. Good coverage of most all of the basics. It goes into a lot of detail on drawing and painting aircraft, ships and vehicles. Good treatment of initially drafting the machines. Given the age of the book (1986), it remains a useful primer to the subject.I hope this title is reprinted. Cam Martin"
5,Lots of fun.,"When Karen decides to have her first boy-girl party WITH kissing games, she and her best friend Janet decide to become experts first. They buy the book and practice the kisses--they'll be two steps ahead of everyone else! Can you prepare for the unexpected though? Lots of laughs and fun for the reader."
3,Didn't tell me what I want to know,My name is shane fry and I need to know more about the hercules engine in my grandpas 1939 cletrac. Can anyone help me in this area.
3,Oopsy,"The video is fine, my 4 yr grand daughter loves it but the Toy Oopsy's outer felt covering fell apart the first day. It looked like it was dry rotted. She was very disappointed."
5,Great for my 3yo,"This is a great kids movie. The old care bears are back, but lookingmodern and vibrant. The premise is that Grizzle the bad bear is tryingto steal the bears 'Belly Badges'. The story revolves around Oopsy DoesIt, a care bear that has no belly badge because he is so clumsy. Hedraws his feelings on his blank belly. My kid loved the movie and is abig fan of the resurgent care bears. The Grizzle scenes are a littlescary, but not too bad. I had to explain that he is a bear who islonely and wants friends. There is a huge care bear amusement park thatthe bears are building that my kid loves. They do a great job of takingyou on the ride with the bears. It looks great on a big screen TV. Igive it a 10. It is very well drawn...do we even say that? Very wellCGI'd"
5,A Must Have for Septic tank owners.,This product is a must have for people who have septic tanks. I have this on auto delivery with Amazon - saw you could do this on the Rid-X commercial - LOVE IT.
5,Easy Peasy,"I get a box of this each month via subscribe and save - great reminder to treat the septic tank.RID-X down the commode, and the septic tank's feeling chipper,everything's A-OK, according to our honeydipper."
5,Rid-x septic system treatment,"For years (30 yrs) we have used Rid-x on a monthly bases ,the product has worked each and every time, not one problem with the septic system , we were a family of 9 persons, til the kids finished school and went on to make thier own life ,now that there are only 2 of us living in the house we still us the product every month, Thank you Amazon for offering to enroll us on a monthly service to receive the Rid-X without purchesing it every month at the store or online, that service is free, ""just like having a personl shopper at our address"". So very easy, we receive rid-x in the mail. we dont have to worry about remembering to purchase it while at the store (at our age we need a list for every thing that needs to be done or purchased) it because it comes in the mail every month. What a blessing we dont even have to remember to purchase it or to use it . When it gets to the mail box, we know its time to use it for that month.RID-X Septic System Treatment: 2 Dose Powder"
5,Rid x delivered,I won't forget to treat my septic system now. The day it's delivered I remember to flush it before I go to bed & I rest knowing we won't have any septic tank overflow! That's peace of mind!
3,IT'S ALRIGHT,I FOUND THAT IF I GO TO HOME DEPOT AND BUY ANOTHER BRAND CALLED ZEP IT COSTS ME LESS AND IS ENOUGH FOR 2 MONTHS OF TREATMENT AND WORKS BETTER
4,Works great,Product itself works great but using the septic pacs are the best.No powder to worry about and no mess!!!
5,Ridex by mail monthly,"Wonderful idea!! Thank you so much whoever thought of this. Even when I put this on my calendar I wouldn't do it or I had run out. Now it comes monthly by UPS, I immediately open it & pour it in. DONE!"
5,GREAT STUFF,HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT--IT REALLY DOES HELP THE SEPTIC TANK KEEP FUNCTIONING MUCH MUCH LONGER THEN EVEN WITH HEAVY USE
5,Awesome,"I can get my Rid X cheaper here online, automatically, and when it comes in the mail, it helps me remember to use it! I love it!!"
2,Problem was not slove by RID-X,"did not do anything for me, I still am facing the sample problem.Called a plumber to see if he can help me out."
4,Rid X is a good product.,"The way we have it set up to purchase once a month is great. I don't have to worry about when I used it last. Our septic system is brand new, and we want to do all we can to keep it working at its best. Rid X is a good product for preventative maintenance."
5,Never have to remember to put it on your shopping list again!,"A Necessity!!! Ordering this from Amazon has made it as easy as possible to remember to put it in your septic tank as scheduled once a month...Before i did this i would procrastinate and probably only used the product 3 or 4 times a year...Now when it comes in the mail , the same evening I following instructions and its done....Thanks for Offering the product on TV...I never would have done this had i not seen the advertisement....Brien"
5,Rid-X review - 2012-November,"I've been using Rid-X for about 5 years. Before I started using it, I had a backed up septic system. I didn't want that to happen again, and when a neighbor suggested using Rid-X, I knew it was worth a shot. Rid-X keeps my septic system working well and worry-free."
5,Perfect,"Works as described. Not the most exciting product, but I love the subscription service. Once a month, like clockwork,this necessary task is taken careof and it's one less thing for me to think about."
5,Rid-X - it works!,"We've been using this product for several years, so I was really glad to see the subscription email from Amazon. I receive a box a month, so I don't have to keep track of when I last used it. This product has prevented us from having our septic system pumped in quite a while. Thank you Rid-X and Amazon!"
5,great job Rid-x,Just had our tank checked and Rid-x had done a great jobThe report came back that we would not need a pumping for many years!
5,A must for septic tanks,"This is a must for your septic system. I love having it on auto ship, so I always know when I need to treat again."
2,Not comparable to Encyclopedia of German Tanks,"I bought this book because I was impressed by its counterpart on German armor. I was disappointed to notice that it doesn't live up to that standard. Where the 'German' book covered each version with technical data, this book often simply summed up all known versions, with a very brief description, often not even mentioning in service date (year) and production numbers. For example, the 24 pages long M4 Sherman section only contains 2 'technical' specification listings.... Same goes for the British Churchill tank section, only a single technical spec list. On the positive side are the sections on more obscure models and prototypes, almost all with illustration(s)."
4,allied tanks,"In many ways not up to standard with its German partner, Encyclopedia of German tanks of World War Two. Armor is not given section by section breakdown, but maximum and minimum. Allied armored cars, which were quite numerous, are not listed, unlike their German equivelent.But on the positive side, an appendix of british and American tank armament is included in the back that is in far more detail than the one provided in the German one which is excellent reading. And the same can also be said of engines.A good refurence in regards to the British, American, Canadian and Australian tanks and their sub types."
3,"A typical encyclopedia, but a handy reference","This book is a nice overview of topic and it gives a good impression of British and American armor of the WW2. It may be a good starting point for a person who has just beginning to show interest on British & American tanks of the WW2. For a tank modeller, it may be a handy reference (if you do not already have a book of this type), since the strenght of this book is nice pictures of the vehicles with brief descriptions. Although, most of the pictures are high quality, they seldom reveal any details that the tank modeller is looking for. The main weakness of this book is that it tries to cover everything and because of that it becomes shallow."
3,British and american tanks of WWII,"Not to bad. Excellent references to unusual variants. good detail about equipment, usage and weaknesses."
4,COOL COMPILATION,Neat to hear Norah before the hype.....I like this live version of Got To See You Again better than the studio one....I think her songwriter Jesse Harris is really good too...Totally worth my ten bucks.....
2,not nora jones,"this CD was advertised as a nora jones CD it is not, she is only on the first song. I was disapointed."
2,NOT WORTH THE PRICE,"Well, it functions just fine but I could have built one myself with the left-over scraps of leather or plastic and a mini tripod. The tripod the comes with the case is one of those $2.00 things good camera stores give away with purchases (I have several that are actually heavier). The whole thing with the cheap leather and little tripod is not worth more than $20. The idea is useful, though just over priced."
2,Works but overpriced,"Well, since this is genuine Edirol accessory, it just has to work as I expected. I managed to find the cheapest online but no matter how great the deal is, it is still overpriced which is typical Roland. Love them products but hate them prices."
4,Edirol Cover and Stand Work Great,"I bought the cover and stand with the Edirol, it fits well and is easy to put on, look very well made. You do need to take it off to plug in to remove files, but all of the other controls are open and withing reach. The stand works fine, just follow the picture to get it in the right way, otherwise the unit will fall over. Nice little addition for the recorder"
1,useless,The size is small and I find it is useless and it is also unstable. One has to be careful to use it.
1,Worthless peice of trash,"Do not buy this from vendor. Must be a ripp off from Edirol. If you go to the Edirol site and look at the image you will notice small, but very signifigant differences. This cover actually covers much of the micraphones and is much cheaper that what is displayed on the Edirol site. Really, do not purchase this. The Edirol recorder is great - this cover makes it terrible."
1,both cheap and expensive,"A lot of money for a piece of cheap plastic.It broke on my second or third use.Tried to see if I could just get the stand again for much cheaper,but I can't find a place that sells it without the cover.It's overpriced by about $50...and that's if it doesn't break.Maybe I need to check camera stores with Edirol in hand."
3,"Yes, works great but should cost a third of the price","As others have mentioned, the cover and stand work great, but considering this is made in a Third World country using slave labor I find it insulting that Edirol would charge almost $60 for this (I originally paid $67 in 2007). Can you say ""corporate greed?""!."
1,I wanted it but never got it !!!,"I did order this item, but it has now been declared lost in the post. So god knows if it was any good. So I made my own and saved 58."
4,Necessity if you want to do serious recordings of music,"This is necessary to interface the Edirol RO-9 to a mike stand or to the miniature tripod. The design is primitive, and the thumbscrew's threads on the bottom aren't long enough to secure the unit all the time (on mine, I can only get two threads to screw into the body of the adapter case or if I press hard, maybe three threads).Roland makes a great product in the RO-9, but their accessories can use improvement. But if you need to interface to a stand, and get the recorder off the table a bit (and away from boundaries) for flatter frequency response, you have no choice but to buy this item."
1,Good for a while but easily broken unacceptable for that hefty price tag,I love the Edirol product but the case is definitely overpriced.I had one. It worked for a while and then the swivel leg brokeand now it's worthless. Lot of money for something that breaksthat easily. Thus I would recommend something else.
5,Crystal Clear,An extraordinary music score!Mistery and powerful from a very talented artist such as Trevor Jones!Highly racommended to everyone love animation of workmen and likes dreaming!
5,Sets the standard!,"This book sets the high standard of the Inspector Morimoto series, of which I've read all three books. I strongly recommend them all. Hemion has found a successful formula, and I like the continuity between the books. I like the maps at the front of each of the books, the trips that Inspector Morimoto makes around Japan, and the puzzling ""mathematical"" plots. And I like the humor! This is a great series of detective/mystery stories."
5,Inspector Morimoto is great!,This book has a fascinating plot.It really makes you think.Definitely for those who enjoy a good puzzle.The setting in Japan also makes it interesting.
5,Great mystery that made me laugh as well!,Hemion has a dry sense of humor.A detective who can cook as well?Those Japanese pancakes are strange!Fantastic logical deductions.One of the best of its kind.I'll definitely read anything else by Hemion.
3,Disappointed,"The reviews were so glowing I bought without looking at the author. I was disappointed that this was not a Japanese book. I thought the background superficial, even tho a good description, you could find that in a travel story. I like more of knowledge of police procedural and culture than this. The low key story was fairly interesting to me. I could easily put it down for a day or two.The logic was new and interesting.I guess you can't prove anything in court tho if we knew how that was done in Japan."
4,Strange but beautiful,"Ok, this is not a commercial one. Music is quiet difficult, and Japanese traditional music tracks are not so good to me.But anyway there is a masterpiece here entitled Memory of Hiroshima. A sad, powerful, epic track evocating all the orror and pain of the atomic disaster of the Japanese city in 1945.Listen to this number with lights turned down, with a good stereo equipment, thinking about desolation, war, destruction: music will lead you to unexpected state of mind. Enjoy."
4,"Great Play, Must See!!","This was a great play, Deborah Cox was wonderful, the singing of all the characters was unbelievable. The interaction between the male characters was hysterical. The character of Khalif added just the right amount of spice to the pot without being over the top. All in all a great play about the African American male-female relationship at all different age levels."
3,This Was Okay,"I was able to sit through the entire DVD, but it didn't move me the way Tyler's plays does. This play seems to be geared towards the more serious minded person and I love a good laugh."
3,Love on Layaway,It was okay...it started out kind of long but got better towards the end...Mel Jackson was great & charming...Deborah Cox was splendid with her singing.....
2,How did this play get 4 stars?,The only reason why I finished this play is because I don't like to waste money.
3,cute...,i like the songs in it.. the one guy that had a hard time with committment should have lost her.. cause he was just plain dumb...
3,Love on Lay-away,Time and time again we watch movies that waste our time. This movie isn't one of them. I can see this as a big screen film. As long as they could change a few things. This one is a must watch.
2,This was an okay movie.,This does not compare to Tyler Perry. It was an okay movie. I am the type of person that will watch my movies over and over again if I like them. I've only seen this one once. It would be like my last pick of the litter.
4,"Nice, but no sitar","Despite the WAH!nderful CD Cover, the CD itself is really quite nice but it misses that bit of excellence that I like to find in music. Sort of easy listening, mantra's for beginners. Suits a night of reading as well as having tea with mom, without her being annoyed."
4,Inattention:,": This was ordered by mistake, but proved to be a good one. Arrived as promised and in great condition. Is a good companion to Graham Greene's ""The End of the Affair:."
2,cookie cutter offering,"There is enough drama in a missing person than linking it to "" big"" issues like the president of Mexico. This is a subterfuge that did not connect with any reality because the world is far more pragmatic and buisness- like. What it does is shout that one american is worth 10 mexicans In fact there are safer exotic locations to travel in.I enjoyed the many scenes of Mexico city from above, in the suburbs and on the street.That was the only interest.Acting was so-so and her character was a brave nice person. So What."
4,discusses an interesting subject,"The book is a survey covering the Egyptian feast lists from the Old Kingdom to the Saite epoch. After a brief, easy-to-understand introduction of feast names, the author describes in five chapters those found from the Middle Kingdom, New Kingdom, Post-Imperial Era (lasting from the Third Intermediate Period to the Saite Period), from the First Intermediate Period to the Middle Kingdom, and finally the Old Kingdom. Recommended, it is an interesting and comprehensive book dealing with a subject rarely touched upon."
4,But have you TASTED Nanita's flan?,"Call me a skeptic, but I think there are better ways to make flan. Soy sauce? Crabmeat? Pickle relish? Nanita's flan recipe wouldn't go over well here in rural Manitoba. Yuck!Still, it's not a bad book. The pictures are nice, and the accompanying 8-track tape has some catchy tunes (""Walk With Me Jesus"" played on the zither is an especially nice touch.)"
4,McCulloch hammer drill,Good drill for $$. Hammer drill function works well. Good power with adjustable speed. Good case. Only negative is keyless chuck does not tighten enough and loosens during hammer vibration. Delivery was quick.
3,Time moves on,"As a TechnoDroid, I'm rather disappointed with this book. However, one must realize that it's now approaching four years old, so the technology of hand held GPS receivers has advanced significantly since the book was written. Battery life, continuous use of receivers and accuracy all are out dated when viewed in light of currently marketed GPS receivers. In particular, accuracy data are completely out of synch with my real life experience with various GPS units.However, other than the time lag aspects, the book is reasonably complete and is well written, albeit, from my point of view, the data is more suited to a non-technical (i.e. beginner) GPS user. For those who deal with technical issues, or who have done any study on the GPS system, the book is rather rudimentary."
2,Marketing Gimmick,Such a great idea converting PDF files to Word text. Unfortunatley this product only converts about 3 out of 10 files accurately with the remaining requiring a much more expensive software product from Scansoft to convert the rest. Almost like the bait and switch tactic preformed by used car salesmen. Buy this product only for very limited use.
2,PDF Converter with Potential,"Having used this product on large (more than 500 pages) and complex documents, my conclusion is that this could be a very good product. Unfortunately, the software has some logic flaws that cause it to fail repeatedly on specfic text formatting. For example, consider the following listing:a. Data Elementb. Data Element Tagc. Element Numberd. Group NumberThe application always fails on this and similar listings by randomly deleting the new paragraph marker and setting the right margin incorrectly. Too bad that Scansoft support, which could alert developers to this type of problem, is the worst I have ever encountered. Perhaps someone from Scansoft will read this review and fix this problem and other problems encountered by customers."
5,Finally,"It's about time that someone came out with this product! PDF files are so difficult to deal with, and our firm often has no way to track down the original. PDF Converter is fast and gets all of us back into Word so we can make adjustments. We've been using it for contracts, but I'm sure it would work great for any files. Documents look perfect. Great Product!"
1,PDF Converter - Warning,"This software only works on NON-ENCRYPTED pdf files. I paid too much money for something that did nothing for me. It read the pictures or scanned files, but not the text oddly enough. It was a waste of my money and my time to install and attempt to convert the file. I wish I would have checked to find out if it was encrypted or not. I might just end up selling it and hopefully get most of my money back."
2,Most of These Stories Should Never Have Been Unearthed,"This anthology highlighted one story for each year of Weird Tales' publication from 1923 to 1954. In most cases, it seemed to include lesser-known works by the magazine's writers, including many pulpish, contrived, overlong, dated ones -- featuring a German werewolf; a Russian devil-man; and Lun Yurka, the Eurasian vampire out of the ""high passes of the Far East."" Many stories were indeed horrific, though not in the ways intended by their authors. Maybe this book showcases the stories that were the rule at the magazine, rather than the best ones.Another collection for pulp lovers is Weird Tales: Seven Decades of Terror (1997)."
5,Peridot Ring,This fit my pinky finger perfectly which is what I wanted. The gem is clear and clean. If it clouds up baking soda or toothpaste cleans it up. I really like this ring.
5,Herzog & De Meuron: Natural History,"Another object book with content that matches the originality of the design. Herzog & De Meuron, the Basel-based architects, are best known for their art museums, but also for creating buildings that are works of art--even when the program is as mundane as a railroad signal box. This companion to the recent CCA exhibition is an anthology of interviews, stimulating essays by artists and clients, and pictures of objects that have inspired them, in addition to an illustrated catalogue of their 200 buildings and projects. (Michael Webb is the book reviewer for LA Architect magazine.)"
1,pyramid power supply,This power supply has stopped working. I am not satisfied with this purchase. I have only used it normally and would not expect that it would simply stop working.
1,PYROMID,"BEWARE! THESE THINGS ARE CHEAP DREK. BRAND NEW OUT OF THE BOX, WITH NO LOAD, NEARLY SET MY HOUSE ON FIRE. SMOKING AFTER ON FOR 10 MINUTES. STEPPED OUT TO LET MY DOG OUT AND WALKED BACK IN TO TOXIC FUME HELL. SMELL WILL NOT GO AWAY AFTER PUTTING IT OUTSIDE. I SHOULD SUE THESE CROOKS! GOOD THING I HAVE A FREE ATTORNEY."
2,ordered 6 of these units,"I ordered 6 of these units. I installed all 6 of them and 1 did not work right out of the box and 1 of them failed after about 5 hours of use, The other 4 are working great, for how long is any ones guess? Amazon will not replace them because they deem them as ""HAZARDOUS WASTE"" no returns on hazardous waste, not sure where they get their information from. They think it is some kind of battery I guess????"
3,NOT FOR BIG POWER LOADS!!!!!,"I purchased this item. I gotta say it works awsomely fantastic. it powers my 1200 watt amp in my room but, I do not recomend useing it with a bigger amp that 1200.If it gets really hot then it will begin to starve my 12 inch sub of power. But over all it does its job."
5,"Works very well, on constantly","I use this power supply with an amateur radio that is on constantly. No RF hash, good stability of power and very reliable. Prefer this over switching power supplies. Good value for the money."
5,Good 12VDC power supply at Great price,"I got this to power my dew heater on my telescope and it does the job quite well. It seems to be well made and works exactly as stated. All metal case with sturdy connectors and IF weight is any indication of quality then this must be a good one. I did not want and did not get a lighter plug connection...this one is set up for direct wire connection only. For those who want to use a lighter plug they make another model like this. As usual, Amazon has a great price on this product!"
4,Pyramid PS12KX Power Suppy,"Great product at a good price. Power supplys are generaly expensive, so i was happy to find this 10 amp PS for the price I paid for it. I would have liked more amperage but didnt want to spend the money. Very good quality. I use it to power a LiPo, NiMh, NiCd DC charger for radio controled truck racing and other radio controled models."
5,Real nice device,"Really nice device, absolutely silent, delivers power with zero headaches. Solid construction with nice connectors and high quality on/off switch. Note that the power measures 12.96 volts with no load, not 13.8. For me, this is a plus."
2,"Books are Hilarious, This is Not!","I started reading the book series when I was in high school [around 9 years ago], and I was SO excited when I heard there was a movie coming out. Then I waited a couple years for it to get made. Then I had to wait a year after every other country's release for it to be released in the US. It didn't come out in theaters, I just happened across it on cable.Awful. They combined two girls' characters, didn't have a lot of people, her parents were kinda lame and too nice, the separate boy/girl schools were combined... I was so disappointed that I had waited so long to see it and it wasn't even funny! The books made me LAUGH OUT LOUD! The movie never made me laugh once. Sigh.I can tell most of the people reviewing the movie haven't read the books... PLEASE read the books instead! Even as an adult, I still luuuurve them!"
3,movie,"My niece wanted to get this movie, but I have to admit I enjoy watching it with her to remind me just how silly life was as a teenage girl. :)"
5,perfect girl becoming a young woman story,never read the books from which this movie is based off of. say this movie first on nick. after seeing it two or three times off of the television had to see if it had been released on dvd. this movie is totally a movie revovling around girls growing up and becoming interested about boys. but still a good watch for people of all ages. this movie will make you laugh out loud. great movie to watch as a family. completely shows what girls will often to do inorder to get the man or boy of their dreams. you do not have to read the books to understand the movie.
4,fun movie,This is a fun teenage / preteen movie. Reminding you of the things girls worry about and the mistakes they make.
2,DVD purchase,Dvd came cracked. Can still be played and is scratch free. It is just a bit cracked but didn't affect it's function. Expected a bit more but was disappointed by its defect.
2,tedious,"could not even watch past 15 mins. poor acting, juvenile. might be ok for some brain dead pre teen, but really why would you want to?"
2,Kids only (tweens),"Sort of a Brit verson of a Nickelodeon type movie...I suspected it before I watched it, but watched it anyway (silly me!). Kids (read young girls) might like it though, so don't let what I say stop you from showing it to the young uns."
5,Great,This movie was great! My Mom bought it for me because I wanted a girly movie so she got this one. I watched every second and laughed a lot! Get this movie! You'll love it.
5,Cute and funny!!,"I watched this with my 11 year old daughter. She really enjoyed the movie.It's about a 14 year old girl who has a crush on a boy and she's trying hard to get his attention even though he seems to have the perfect girlfriend. Her parents have an incredible relationship, but her father goes to Australia for his job and her mother is left behind with her and her sister. Georgia believes her mom will leave her father for a younger man who happens to be fixing their house. A boy she has no interest in has a crush on her. Her best friend is dating her crushes brother...it's a really good story. Very funny too!! It does have a mature element to it with girls and their first kisses, bras and actual thongs."
2,Too many changes,"I've been a fan of the book series this is based on, since I was in high school. When I heard there was a movie, I was super excited. Then I saw it. If it were not based on the book, I would have rated it higher. However, because it is based on the book I didn't like it. There were too many changes and they did not seem necessary at all. Some of the casting felt wrong, especially Robbie and Tom. I really like the actor who plays Robbie, but he seemed a lot younger than Tom. Dave the Laugh (my favorite character in the series) was ok, but his dialogue felt awkward instead of funny and cheeky. The differences do not end here, but I won't continue. If you like it, that is great. As a fan of the books, I can't accept it."
2,Benign...,This story had such potential but it turned out to be a tepid romance with little intrigue - with characters who lacked lively personalities. It just wasn't that interesting. (Sorry)
2,Expensive and not great,"I bought this when I was down in Savannah at one of the company's stores. Doesn't incorporate well into the skin so leaves a greasy layer, kind of like using Vaseline. It also contains a lot of water so after application, water oozes out making the surface of this layer wet."
4,Smells amazing!!!,"I am outdoors a lot and have skin on the dry side, especially in winter. I got some of this for christmas from work because my first name is Savannah and my last name begins with a B.Pros:Amazing smell, sort of like sweet blueberries with a hint of the almond and honey scents. I wish I could rub this stuff all over me and buy a matching perfume.Hydrates nicely- I've been using on my hands and feet, it is even softening my icky barefoot childhood calluses some.All natural ingredients I know how to pronounceThick formula, not oily or watery- this is about the consistency of margarine.ConsThe tag on this says it costs $12 at the shop it was purchased at. It apparently costs $25 on amazon? EEK! I totally can't rub this stuff all over me, the jar is tiny!It contains royal jelly, and I am slightly phobic about bees. I am not sure I'd be brave enough to wear this outdoors in summer, might attract bees."
5,great product,"I originally purchased Beeswax Hand Cream while I was in Savsnnah. I loved it so much that I needed to get more. It has done such an incredible job on my cutitcles, and has a wonderful aroma, not to mention how my hands feel after I apply the cream to them."
2,Not good with the NEC ND-2500A,"I bought an NEC ND-2500A 8X burner last month and bought a pack of Memorex 8X DVD-R's for my first burns. They ended up only burning at 4X, which is acceptable at this state of the DVD-R game. After reading through some forums, I found out that FujiFilm 4X DVD-R 10-packs were known to burn at 8X as they are Taiyo Yuden media. So I bought those and they indeed burned at twice their rated speed.These Imation discs, however, max out at 2X. Even after downloading some ""tweaked"" firmware from the http://www.rpc1.org forums. Bummer!Anyone looking for good media for their specific burner should read up on forums as much as possible before buying packs of 25, 50, or 100 DVD-R's or DVD+R's. I hear +R's are much better overall, so I'll be sticking with them from now on.Recommended brands:Taiyo Yuden, Mitsubishi, Verbatim, TDK, FujiFilm, HP, Mitsui."
1,Check Before You Buy!,"I urge anyone considering this media go to the Imation web site & check compatability with their burner before purchase (wish I did) http://www.imation.com/products/dvd_media/index.html I'm running an NEC 3520A drive & this media flat wont work at any speed yet I have had NO PROBLEMS with Maxell, Phillips, & Verbatim media. I went for the Imation product first since I have always bought their CD media in the past & been very happy with it. Not sure what the issue with the DVD media is but I wont be wasting time/money on them again - I'll pass these on to my father-in-law & hope they work for him. Note this is not an Amazon issue as they were purchased at a local store."
4,Outstanding author,"The writer of this volume is a former curator at the Louvre. He seems to understand artists, creative motivation, genres, influences, and to write about them in clear, concise vocabulary. His writings on images and ideas are inspirational and lift art above contemporary emphasis on $ values."
4,A historical perspective on anti-thinking,"Nanez does a good job in the first few chapters of surveying the Biblical foundations for a balance of mind & spirit, pointing out that the Scripture rarely makes the distinctions between rationality and emotions that we do today.The last 2/3 of the book deal primarily with the historical aspects of anti-intellectualism within American pentecostalism / charismatic circles, and may not be as appealing to those who haven't a clue who Charles Parnham is.All in all, an excellent read!"
5,Excellent Insightful Read!,The book arrived in like new condition and in about the time specified by the shipper. I am really enjoying the intellectual topics discussed in the book and recommend that all Full Gospel Christians take the time to read this book.
1,"Lafable copee, ridiculous erorrs","Despite being toted as a college-level text (with a hefty price tag), this book is rife with typos, missing words and ridiculous formatting, including classics such as ""existing the office"" instead of ""exiting the office."" On top of this, the introductions to the playwrights distort their views and words to render them more politically correct. The editors make no mention of Strindberg's incredibly sexist views in the introduction to ""Miss Julie"". The ""Topics for Critical Thinking and Writing"" are so leading they aren't suitable for anyone more intellectually sophisticated than a middle-school student. All of this after it has gone through eight editions!In summary, this collection is hastily assembled with little proof-reading and less thought and research put into the introductions and ""Play in Performance"" sections. Do NOT buy this anthology. You would be better served selecting the plays you want to cover and buying used copies of each play."
2,$104 !!!!!!,"I remember reading and, subsequently, teaching earlier editions of this book. It's a handy collection -- with a particularly good translation of Lysistrata. But that was then, when the book was well under $25. Now it's $104!? That should buy a hardcover with color photos and DVD of famous productions. I know everything goes up in price, but what are we really doing to our students if we ask them to fork over so much money for literature?"
3,College,Great book for my college theatre/writing class. Was most referred to in my syllabus and in good condition. Rather large book and was stunned when it arrived.
4,this cd takes you away,"when i bought this cd i had never heard about it before i just bought it because i read about it and it looked good. When i listened to it it was ok and then it grew on me. THis is just a great cd the music is real quiet not what you would expect its different then just about anything. Its done by these three po surfers who wrote the songs but its not just a jam cd its really good i would recomend it to anyone, especially people who love the beach and the ocean."
2,Didn't know what to expect.....but didn't expect much,"I didn't have high expectations for this CD. I was expecting something just below the level of Jack Johnson. What I heard was much worse. I honestly think they should have made it instrumental, as most of the vocals are quite terrible and distract from the songs. There is no flow or pattern to the album, yet it all blends in to one bland mess. I tried to like it, but it just didn't grab me like I had hoped it would."
1,Not good,"The Moon and the Bonfires is quite probably the most boring book I have ever attempted to read. Though short, its 156 pages felt daunting. It was like reading a hermit's diary: absolutely nothing happens, the narrator is quite dull and the characters he meets are more so.I would not recommend this book to anyone except those seeking a cure for insomnia"
1,Can you say: Rip-Off!!!,"I'm evaluating this one, and discovered that this KVM has NO cables?!?! How can you use a KVM without cables. The DVI cables from Belkin cost like $80. This raises the price to over $500 for full functionality. Rip Off!!!Lastly, I heard so many horror stories about poor performance, bad video, connectivity, and also that the cables block the USB ports.Seems that Belkin doesn't quite have a clue with this product..."
5,Another winner!!!!!,"Ben Rudnick and Friends have done it again! Fun and Games will provide the glue to bring your whole family, young and old, together. The songs on this CD are very positive and upbeat while at the same time having a terrific sound to them. This CD is one where the more you listen to it the better and better it gets, with no burn out! You can't go wrong with this one. It will be a family favorite forever!"
2,Full of typos,"First, the book is a landmine of typos. It's mainly elementary concepts covered in other books as well. Skip it and find a more mainstream book. Most of the stuff here are covered in books by Veronesi or Stefanica, or even a pure stochastic calculus book such as Shreve's. There is a reason the book has only one edition in over 10 years."
2,"sloppy editing, little additional material over previous work","Slapped together and little better than his original book. The original and a few downloaded PDFs are a better value. I'm beginning to think JW&S specializes in adding slipcovers with fancy graphics and nice new clean typefaces onto stale old previous material. Like middle-aged men who suddenly start dressing bizarrely younger in an unsuitable style, the result is neither value added, becoming, or informative."
1,Not for beginners,"This book seems to have been written for mathematical finance experts...but then what's the point? If you already know the stuff, why bother buying a book you already know everything about?"
1,Computational finance: Tavella,Badly written/errors/typos all over.Reviews/praise (on back cover) are meaningless & misleading.
3,could have been more enjoyable if not for Mom...,"This movie started off great, and the premise certainly is entertaining enough. I mean, this certainly isn't the only movie with a overbearing and neurotic mom. However, as the movie progressed, I found myself disliking Diane Keaton's character more and more. I suppose this is a credit to Ms. Keaton herself that she was able to play the annoying Mom character so well, but GAH!I kept wishing that something horrible would happen to Mom. She is just so annoying, and her daughter, as much as she tries (though she's a pushover at times) just can't get through to Mom. And when Mom wanted to arrange the furniture, I found myself wishing she would get hit by a bus or something. Mom just won't stop meddling, and I was rather disappointed at the end of the movie. It would have been awesome to see Daughter totally rip Mom a new one, but that just didn't happen. This was a movie with a lot of potential that just sputtered out."
5,Diane at her finest,"This movie was made for Diane Keaton. She is funny, yet human as her role as mom gets a little carried away. I just loved it!!"
4,Good comedy,"Yes, it's another romantic comedy, but it's not that bad movie. Defenatly I'd give more then 3 stars."
3,Flawed but decent.,"Because I Said So starring Diane Keaton and Mandy Moore is a so-so mother/daughter movie. Parts of this movie work and of course parts of it fall flat. The supporting cast is annoying but the true talent of this film is Mandy Moore. She holds her own as Milly, her mother is controlling, opininated, nervous, and constantly on her daughter's back about settling down and sticking to a relationship. This movie has some funny moments but don't expect it to blow you away. If you're a Diane Keaton then this movie is for you."
5,GREAT MOVIE,Love this movie... Watched it a few times at my MoM's. It is one that can make you laugh when need. Understandable to those who knows what life is like when things going haywire.
1,Terrible!,"It's not so much that the acting is bad....but the movie is soooooooooooo stupid that it hurts. First off, the tittle to the movie says it all...what a crappy movie. Youck! x 5!!!!"
2,Lightweight and overdressed,"Between the amazing digs in some of the highest priced real estate in the States which everyone seemed to enjoy despite being underemployed, I couldn't understand how Keaton (whom I LOVE) managed to avoid heatstroke all bundled up in those tweeds and berets, etc. Didn't anyone ever visit Venice, California EVER?It's WARM there. I kept losing story and character involvement to big skirts, WIDE belts and NY winter garb. I hate that.On the other hand, as others have mentioned, it was very light on character/storyline and little TOO silly while aiming for smart -- in short CONFUSED."
1,Don't waste your time..truly terrible movie!,"This movie was such a disappointment, since I generally love Diane Keaton. I am also such a sappy romantic that I am quite easy to please in the romantic comedy department, so I said, ""How bad can it be?"" Well, it's BAD....I just about walked out on this one!"
1,Barely cracked a smile.,"I love Mandy Moore as an actress so I had to rent this. I was very, very disappointed. The characters are horrible and unsympathetic. The humor is cheap. The mother is irritating and overly pushy to a completely unbelievable degree.Pass this one by."
5,Because I said so,"We enjoyed this movie in the theater and were happy to be able to own it and even got a discount from buying it through Amazon, Mandy more was great! Enjoy."
1,Shrill,"Diane Keeton is just as obnoxious as you've heard. Mandy Moore, is cute and charming. The sisters are pretty useless. There are some laughs but it's mostly uncomfortable to sit through Diane Keeton's shrill performance. God help us, I hope she is that good an actress and not that annoying in real life. If you have any sort of warm fuzzy feelings for Diane Keaton because you remember her back when she was great, then don't watch this, it will taint your memory of her forever."
1,we wish to give it negative stars,"My wife and I both liked Keaton, so we rented this movie from Blockbuster. The movie was so bad that we made up our mind never to watch another movie from Keaton ever again. It's a movie about a pair of excessively narcissistic mother and daughter indulge themselves at the costs of their own lives and lives around them. And the movie tries to make it look fun and promising. What is fun and promising for being narcissistic and destructive?! It's simply annoying! Beyond the plot, the directing and acting is simply despicable. But then, what can actors do to play out such a silly drama, except being excessively silly? The whole movie is an insult to the viewer's intelligence."
2,Mostly boring,"I love romantic comedies so even though the critics gave this one a bad review I wanted to see for myself. The only likeable character was Gabriel Macht's ""Johnny""; all the other main characters were just annoying.All I can say is that I'm glad I choose to borrow this one from the public library because it only cost me a dollar."
1,Ms. Keaton paging Woody Allen,"Diane Keaton is a very good actress who is in serious need of a good role. I would suggest she page up Woody Allen and see if he can help her out. Because I Sad So is just short of unwatchable. I am not certain if it is just a bad storyline, or a combination of bad storyline, awful editing, and under/overacting. The most disappointing aspect of this waste of one hour and 42 minutes is the waste of good acting talent. Mandy Moore is a charming actress, and Diane Keaton is outstanding, but this movie was just awful.One star, since a half is not available."
1,What a Shame,"I bought the movie because Lauren Graham was in it and I knew what a great comedian and singer she is. Instead I got Diane Keaton and Mandy Moore, neither of which gave a very stellar performance.I hope in the not too distant future Lauren Graham will be STARRING in some good movies."
3,Relationships,A good movie to sit down with a bowl of popcorn in front of a roaring fire and just enjoy.
2,Mildly enteraining...,"2.5 stars. I liked the movie a little more than I expected, but the script sort of fell apart. I'm not a big Diane Keaton fan, her voice rides my nerves and for the last couple of decades she's played the same character over and over. I do like movies that touch on the complicated relationships between mothers and daughters. They always make for great drama. This one was just a little too pat and uninspired. Still, it was mildly entertaining."
2,Uninteresting and repetitive,"The movie is about an overbearing meddling mother who decided to play a match maker for her youngest daughter.Diane Keaton, who happens to be a talent actress, horribly overacts here and turns into a cliche. There are the same cake in the face, bad dating prospects, annoying children, seen in many other movies. This is dull and forgettable."
1,0 Stars-Amazon..makes you give at least 1,"This is the WORST movie I have seen in a loooonnnggg time. Diane Keaton-as mom- is the MOST neurotic, overbearing, personal space invading nutcase-with an overly cutesy stupidity act. And Mandy Moore is a crying daughter of nutcase Keaton's character. This movie is unfunny(I saw it free-at a hotel on HBO). It is stupid-obnoxious and and just annoying. I used to respect Diane Keaton as an actress, until I saw this piece of garbage. Hey Di...stick to selling cosmetics-obviously your movied career is on the wane. Don't watch this-unless you like to be tortured."
2,Not-so-good.,"I'd have to agree with the general review about this film. The movie is quite badly done. The movie is about the conflict between a domineering mother and a pushover daughter. Diane Keaton and Mandy Moore both over-act and gets down right annoying to watch. And as mentioned in other reviews, it seems as though the film tries to downplay the fact that Mandy Moore's character is two-timing two men. Millie (Mandy) does get pushed around by her mother and we are made to feel bad for her but it still doesn't justify the fact that she cheats on her men.I did enjoy Diane Keaton's wardrobe and actually Mandy Moore's as well for that matter. Lauren Graham and Piper Perabo are quite charming as Mandy's sisters but all in all, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Two stars - a generous rating."
3,O.K. hokey,loved the decor in the rooms. Story was over acted by Mandy Moore and Diane Keaton. Sappy but fun enough for a slow afternoon making cupcakes or any another diversion. You can do 2 things at once while watching this movie. It could have been better. I am not sorry I bought it.
3,Not the best I've seen,"I was excited to see so many of my favorite actress' in this movie but then was disappointed to see what the movie actually had to offer. I didn't find as much humor in this movie as I thought I would. Diane Keaton's character had some cute moments but, by the end of the movie, had become annoying with her persistence that she knew what was best for her daughter in spite of the fact that the 'right' man that she had picked out for Milly, her daughter, was making her daughter absolutely miserable.Lauren Graham was in the movie for very few scenes, which was also a great let down to me as I really like her acting.This is definitely a movie that I would watch but I don't think that I'd spring for the money to buy it as I don't feel that I'll bother to watch it again."
4,Cute chick flick,"I bought the DVD because I was watching it on TV and lost the last 45 minutes of the film... I enjoyed the movie... Diane Keaton is great, and I love Mandy Moore as well as the actresses that played her sisters... all my favorites.The DVD was in very good quality as proclaimed by seller"
1,Possibly the most insulting movie I've ever seen,"I mean insulting to the viewer's intelligence.Save the funds, watch it on cable, where it will without a doubt live indefinitely."
5,A great movie for everyone,This was such a great movie and so enjoyable. My boyfriend and I and our kids laughed and cried and so enjoyed it.
3,Innapropriate but laughable,"I went to see the movie because I love Lauren Grahm. She, you muct admit was awesome. The relatioship between the mother and Mandy Moore's charachter was well developed. The little boy was adorable, and a realistic character. After that, I found the movie innapropriate. It would have been much better without all the sex talk. I think that the plot was well developed enough to go without the constant allusions to sex. In conclusion, cute movie, but could've done without the sex content."
2,love chick flicks but there is a limit,"Chick flicks are ment to be funny and relaxing, inspite the great actors, their performance was not the best and that is niether fun or relaxing."
2,"Offensive, annoying....silly","I was ok with the movie until the lead character started sleeping withboth guys she was dating. Is this supposed to be interesting?Furthermore, I like Keaton, but doesn't it seem she's stopped actingand just plays the same ditzy mom over and over? Also, the lead is so successful as a pro chef, but is an idiot in the rest of her life. Believable? I don't think so, it's ridiculous and annoying."
1,Hello? Anyone in there?,"This is a movie about a few idiots who are wrapped up in some god aweful situation making for one god aweful movie. What happened to morality and pride in women? This is a sad revelation. I think this movie promotes a lifestyle that I would hate for any of my children to grow up to become. And Dianne Keaton definetly has to grow up. Her days of Annie Hall were great, but very much over. It's time to mature and become a distinguished actress. Maybe I'm wrong? I have no idea. But this was definitly a walk out. One's sex life is nobody's business but their own and this movie was just pretty disgusting. It's like they TRY to shock the people in the audience as opposed to writing material that will sincerely make someone laugh by using satire. Anyone could say ""orgasm"" and get a laugh because it's so rediculous. How abbout trying to write some good satire instead of going for shock value. All I saw was a bunch of air-head bimbo women trying to make a movie. Grow up all ready."
5,The reader will experience a young girl's family struggle to survive,"The Irish Dresser is fantastic historical fiction which tells the story of Ireland's Potato Famine that occurred between 1845 and 1850. Told from the perspective of thirteen year old Nora McCabe, the reader experiences her family's struggle to survive. Nora decides to escape by hiding in her family's dresser aboard the ship, fantasizing about food and a better life. The reader experiences the difficult journey experienced by over two million Irish through Nora's touching story. Surely, students will be engaged by the McCabe family's tragic and difficult voyage to America in search of food, as well as Nora's vivid and descriptive voice. The Irish Dresser is an exciting story about the reality of taking risks and facing the unknown. This title will make a fantastic read aloud and could be enjoyed by students in grades 2-6."
3,For the Fans,"Fans of Justice Thomas will find much to cheer and swoon over in this synopsis of his many constitutional law opinions (majority, concurring, and dissenting alike). Others, however, will find a disjointed collection of poorly edited outtakes clumsily presented in a linear fashion that seems to skip from one constitutional provision to another. Rather than paint the reticent justice's approach to the law with strokes outlining his primary tenets, Holzer paints by numbers, beginning with Article 1 and working his way through the Bill of Rights.I found this approach to be generally painful, and longed for a concise, expository presentation of Justice Thomas's jurisprudence, beginning with introductions to his originalist principles and followed by illustrative case examples. Instead, I received a torrent of not always helpful case examples, with principles occasionally peaking through."
5,Listening to Eckhart Tolle,"Every time I play this while driving, I get something new from it. I like hearing his thoughts in his own voice. His book,A New Earth, changed my life, and this audio tape has added to that."
1,Ugh.,"Eckhart Tolle should be banned from doing any voice recording. He is just GOD AWFUL to listen to you. I mean, Oprah loves him and everything, and maybe the written books are a better format for him, but the sound of his voice on this CD was such a turn off I think I am ruined in him forever.He has some god-awful accent that is like nails on a chalkboard and he stammers on like some nerd who can't spit his words out. And don't even get me STARTED on his child-molester laugh. Seriously, I can't believe his handlers let him make a recording of his voice. I can't beleive this has not destroyed his career. I've heard his ideas are good, but his publicist should have had someoene else read the book on tape because I could never even get past his horrible, horrible, and I mean REALLY horrible voice so I have no idea what his ideas are."
1,Wasted money,"As a cd before bedtime this will effectively put you to sleep. Buy it as a sleep aid. Sadly as I know Tolles work in his books is just a series of copy of others words, mis quotes from the bible and playing with words its hard to listen to this tape for long. Still it adds money to his billions of dollars and hopefully his desire for huge amounts of money will end soon and he will find the peace he craves."
4,Living in the Present reduces stress and anxiety,Living a Life of Inner PeaceThis two CD set of Eckhart Tolle details how by living in the present you get rid of the ghosts of your past and worry about your future. I found this training to be of immense help and have several friends with whom I will share this. The narration is very soft spoken - soothing.
5,Revolutionary music so inspiring it will make you want to learn more.,This cd is great! There are so many emotions conveyed through music that there is always a track to fit your mood. My favorite song is El Picket Sign. It has a great rhythm and references to Juarez and Zapata make me wish I wasn't such an Anglo!
2,Movimiento sounds.,I am a 70's activist who 'cut his teeth' on the L.A. Moritorium and spent hours on the picket lines of many a Big Bear Market during the Grape Boycott years so I looked forward to this CD's music with great anticipation but was sorely disappointed. Several of the songs sound as if there was a low-grade tape recorder on top of a metal trash can and a group of people were simply singing some songs to pass the time. I am glad I bought it (for sentimental reasons) but it was not what I expected. One exception is the Alacranes Mojado music which is excellent!
5,The most awesome book of God's love and grace,"I first read this book in 1996, it was a gift from a friend. I have gone back to this book time and time again since. This wonderful, exciting, awesome book puts so simply God's marvelous love and grace towards us, His children. This book isn't about striving, or fighting or working hard to be who God wants you or I to be. This book is so powerful in that it lays open for each and everyone of us the simple fact that Jesus wants us to give him the burden of living this life and let Him live His life through us. It is in completely giving ourselves over to Him that this life becomes bareable and livable. This book shows us so simply and yet most powerfully ""It is no longer I, but Christ..."""
5,A Great Read To Encourage Christian Growth!,"""Principles of Spiritual Growth"" focuses on the basics needed to encourage and challenge the reader to further maturity in Jesus Christ. The book is around 110 pages and contains 18 short chapters focusing on topics such as:1. Faith2. Purpose3. Preparation4. Identification5. Self6. Self-Denial7. The Cross8. Discipleship9. Rest10. ContinuanceWhile some of the reading may appear to be basic to some readers, it certainly does not hurt to be reminded lest we fall!The narrative is easy to read and flows smoothly from topic to topic. Read, enjoy, and be challenged and encouraged. Recommended!"
3,you too can hop on a plane and visit hell,"loved his sense of humour, with pictures of the family picnic in[at] hell to boot lol I wouldnt recommend his books for those just starting to investigate this issue even though his books are very easy to read and can be finished in 15-20 minutes if that, but it will add to your understanding of this issue from a different perspective all together"
2,Does not explain his position very clearly,"Though I believe in Universal Redemption I think that Martin Zender's book was way too light on the subject and he didn't really explain himself well. If I hadn't already read more academic works by quality authors I don't think this book would have convinced me one bit. Don't waste your money here. Get a quality book by a quality author. Perhaps ""Christ Triumphet"" or ""Every knee shall bow"" by Thomas Allen or the many other works by much better authors."
1,DId not convince me...Made me feel sad.,"I think this book may be an advertisement for the Concordant Publishing Concern. You will have to read it to see what I mean. If you are not aware, the CPC is a Universalist publishing company. The book begins with a rant revealing the spiritual formation of juvenile Martin Zender and his fights with his mother about hell. Its funny how many books purporting to have mysterious biblical insight begin upon a foundation of a person's experience. As the story continues, Martin grew to be smart and wise and thus he wrote this trendy argumentative little book to teach HIS ideas to what he calls ""seekers"". Zender asserts that everyone goes to heaven, hell does not exist as a place of departed souls (It's just a garbage dump), the lake of fire is a place where sinners will nap until they get out, and everything was far easier before the cross."
3,I was surprised to see how these burned the paint...,"Quite an old design to us smokers,but getting two different orders, found that both colors had the same problem, they bubbled up with burns.Fox Run Ash Tray"
1,Ash Tray Burns,The looks and design are good but the resin used for manufacturing leaves burn marks if the heat source contacts it a short time. Normal use leaves burn marks.I would have returned it but the shipping cost for return makes it a loss.I bought one at Walmart with same looks and it performs like it should.I would not reccomend this product!!!
2,DISAPPOINTING,"In all honesty, I was quite disappointed by this collection of short stories. I have always been a great fan of time-travel adventures, yet most of these short stories turned out to be uninspired, shallow, and inconsequential. The only pleasant surprise out of these twelve short stories was Ursula K. Le Guin's very interesting tale entitled Another Story."
2,Bad script and direction don't hurt good acting,"I bought this video for one reason and one reason only. I wanted to see if Reshma Shetty could act beyond what she does in Royal Pains. I had written my book Gone Missing and the subsequent screenplay with her in mind for the character of Lalita Singh. I needed to know if she could pull it off.I'm convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that she'd be perfect. So, did I get my money's worth? If I think of it as an audition reel for Reshma Shetty then absolutely.I wish I could say more about the film but it was really hard to watch. Most of the lead performances, especially Ruby Dee's were stellar. But the script, the dialogue and the direction missed the mark. I found myself skipping forward to the scenes where Reshma was in. Unfortunately there weren't many. The other characters just didn't hold my interest. I didn't care what happened to them."
3,Rival Wok,"I have not tried this wok because I went to the store and looked at it. The non stick coating was uneven, the metal was flimsy, and it looked cheap. I am looking for a gift, and I would not want to give this one to anyone. Sorry, just being honest."
2,"DVDs are VERY Difficult to navigate, Sloooow to Start","The first disc has a good program. Discs two and three consists of additional commentary.Also, UOPs (User Operation Prohibition) are enabled on all 3 DVDs, prohibiting the viewer from Fast Forwarding during sections that are protected by this universally loathed feature, meaning that you are FORCED to watch certain content (previews, long introductions) that you have no interest in.If not for the UOPs (User Operation Prohibition) it would be 4 Stars."
1,MJ12 documents,"Looks like nothing has changed in ufology.""The MJ-12 documents are the most important documents ever to be leaked""You have got to be kidding..The author of the book and reviewers still dont understand the mj12 documents were complete and utter garbage.No wonder the field is a complete and utter joke.If rational thinking was an organ. then it atrophied years ago with ufologists.Cant they actually do research before they write books or reviews anymore..and yes..I must work for the secret world govt team that stops the truth getting out.I believe ufo`s exist..but you dont need govt`s to try and discredit the phenomena too hard with the the people ""involved"" in it doing such a great job of making the whole thing a joke..well done guys.."
4,The code _does_ compile!,"This book teaches you how to program 2D games and a game engine. It doesn't teach you DirectX or OpenGL, just programming with the Windows API. I've got a Dutch translation, I don't know if the code is cleared from bugs in my edition, but chapter 3 compiles, even in Dev-C++.I want to say to the poster about the C++ language: you can't give a book a low rating because the author uses a language you don't understand. Learn C++ and read the book again then, maybe you will understand it better."
2,Running into trouble...,"Chapter 3 will not compile in Borland 5.5 or DEVC++ on XP Pro... this could be because many of the code citations do not indicate in which file to place them. Is it possible that the author assumes I know more than I do? It's supposed to be a ""teach yourself"", not a ""honing your already excellent skills"" book.Currently tripping on ""Declaration syntax error"" in a resource file. Argh."
1,speculation at best,"it's nice to put a pack of lies on video and call it science. where is the dna evidence? could the first Europeans cross the Atlantic in open boats. if early Americans really did descend from some European travelers, it could be proven by looking at the DNA in the bones they left. This has yet to be proven. The producers of this movie create a whole story around speculative evidence at best."
3,On being able to understand without sound!,"This film was totally marvelous in its presentation of technological application to understanding our pre-history of the Ice Age. The first time I saw this was on the Discovery channel and completely understandable even without sound. It is this DVD, I am unable to understand -- no captioning or subtitles which was available during the showing on the Discovery Channel. Why not on this format? It was on TV! A delightful presentation of history and one that is collectible on DVD except for the fact -- no captioning or subtitles something that is frequently unavailable in many of the films being released on DVD. For example many of the films by the actor Tony Curtis is lacking in that there is no captioning. I picked him as he recently passed away and the films are still out there without captioning."
3,"Great Fantasy, on the level of Clan of the Cave Bear","Length:: 7:55 MinsThis video is based on faulty science. But it is very entertaining as far as a drama goes. I thought the acting was great. Unfortunately it is misleading as far as the science goes. Even if Europeans had come over, which the evidence does not support, they would have not evolved light skin yet.Once you get past the fact that this is not history, but historical fantasy, like Clan of the Cave Bear, it can be very entertaining. Beautiful actress.This video is really just part 1 of 5. You can see the rest at my youtube channelhttp://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=D5DF56947FC83F51"
2,Theodore Joanne(or something like that),"This is a christian-based childrens book.I read it as a kid and I was bored,but I was easily bored,always,when it came to books,and dearly devoted to Sweet Valley Twins!!!!!This is about Teddy-Jo and the fact that she is terrified to dive into the swimming pool in swimming class!(She shouldn't have to!)Eventually,it is her normally mean sister,Linda,who helps her by quoting from the bible that we are not meant to have spirits of fear.In other words we should just chill out and be happy.Cool!!"
2,Terrible writing,"I was very excited to get this book- I love the era of Toulouse-Laurtrec, Degas and Renoir, so couldn't wait to read it. Except, the author has no idea how to write. I think I read ""mon dieu"" six times on one page. She clearly knows around 15 french words and uses them repeatedly. The inner dialogue of Suzanne was embarrassing. This is one of the first books I couldn't finish."
1,Junk Fan,"I purchased this fan, and it is JUNK !!!! It lasted 2 months and then the motor quit working, and trying to get a refund from Amazon is a joke!Save your time and money and go to Home Deopot or Lowes and get a fan!"
1,garbage for the price of 100 dollars,This fan is garbage for the price of 100 dollars. It died with in a month.
2,Cowhide Leather Doesn't Cut It,"These are fine if you're taking a romantic walk in a snowstorm - but don't try shoveling snow with them, or doing anything where you have to TOUCH THE SNOW, because they get soaked through pretty quick and your hands end up sitting inside the squishy insulating material. The modern ""hi-tech"" synthetic stuff is far superior."
1,Not well finished at all,"I ordered these for a Christmas gift, thinking they looked nice and a somewhat dressy mitten. I was so disappointed when they arrived. They look like they are lined with insulation, and on the cuff there is no finishing. The lining and leather meet at the cuff (typically you see the leather folder over about a .5 inch inside the mitten to make it look nicer. They are incredibly stiff and would never fit or stay in a coat pocket. Those looking for something warm that do not need them to look at all dressy may still like these, as I am guessing they are warm. However, If I was going for warmth only I would likely go for a more rugged mitten all together. I plan on returning these."
4,Very Warm Mittens,These are nice and warm and well-made. The only negative is they're a little big and it's had to get them in places - like door handles on cars.
3,Works OK,"We used this in our RV for TV reception. When we removed the tv tuner, I re-wired it to receive FM. It does a good job."
3,just ok,these antennas work ok. I puchased them before the digital transition so they are anolog only. So if that is what you are looking for these will do just fine. I only gave three stars because of the anolog only and they don't work as good as the $15.00 antenna I got a wally world.
5,MOBILE ANTEENA OF CHOICE,I am very satisfied with my purchase of 4 channel Diversity twin antennas. The delivery time reasonable and I am just as impressed with Amazon as they followed up on a credit due myself for shipping cost that I saved when S/H decided to send my item via US mail as apossed to UPS carrier reason the cost of the item I ordered would have been less than the cost of shipping thus creating a second review of how item would be shipped assuring best possible cost effective for myself the customer. My savings amounted to twenty dollars saved this is impressive.I am giving Amazon five stars Thank You Amazon..Aloha Robert Anstedt
5,Explains Muscle Testing,Healing Energies is a book that explains muscle testing for determining which foods and vitamins affect our bodies in negative ways. I have used this testing to help determine which foods I can and cannot eat. Read the book to learn how foods that are bad for us can make our muscles weak. Very informative.
2,Nice - but outgunned and outclassed,"There is nothing wrong with this book. In fact, it is a good value for the price. The problem is that this book is a handgun blasted apart by a cannon. The cannon is the larger, heavier, more expensive (but well worth it) book on Fallingwater by Edgar Kaufman Jr. (Wright's pupil and son of the client).For a less expensive gift - this is the book.For yourself, a Frank Lloyd Wright fan, or a lover of Fallingwater; invest in the cannon - it will blow you away!"
5,Great Video,I knew the work of the producer and found these videos to be without compare. I have not seen anything else that presents the story of Jesus' concern for mankind in this setting. I can't tell enough people about the interesting narratives found on these videos. I will likely purchase more copies to give as presents.
5,I Love how Jefferson Moore protray Jesus Christ!,These short biblical movies in real life situation is something everyone I mean every person on earth should see. Jefferson Moore as Jesus Christ answer all kinds of questions people ask God I'm sure all the time. Watch this and be enlighten in wisdon and love.
4,Beautiful Comforter Set,"I love this comforter set. Right after I got it I had problems with my cat peeing on my bed (and new comforter) and had to wash it several times within a couple of weeks and it's help up great in the wash machine, as well as the decorative pillows. Love this!"
3,Good history and detail but too fragmented,"At the beginning of the book, my attention was held very well. However, as my reading progressed, things got a little muddled. I found that the author liked to jump around the timeline quite a bit. This led to confusion due to the number of characters in the story (necessary as this is history and they were part of it) but no consistency in the narrative with relation to time. If you are looking for a rootin' tootin' shootin' western about Doc Holliday, this is not for you. But as a history, despite some small problems, it is very good."
3,Not a book for entertainment,"This is not an easy read for the entertainment of the weekend warroior. This is a serious in-depth resource book for the historian. The author exposes pieces of the legend of the famous dentist to reveal a man of humility who refuses to be bullied. Doc is a man who values friendship. It is this trait that led to his becoming an important figure in the shootout at the OK corral and it is this event which gained for Doc the reputation of a killer, a gunfighter, a notorious figure of the Wild West. The author did his homework. Read this book if you want to submerge yourself in the man, not wade in the legend."
5,Good read,I bought this for a friend and he really liked it. I recieved the book alot quicker than I had expected.
5,A True Doc Holliday Fan,"If you hunger for more information on Doc Holliday look no further. Doc is here hidden in the pages of Gary L. Roberts book. I first rented this book from my local library, and loved it so much I had to buy and add it to my collection. One of the best books on Doc you will find!!!"
4,Doc Holliday,Ordered this book for my grandson who is incarcerated. Thank you. He was interested in the book and have not heard if he is interested in ordering others
3,"detailed, interesting, seems accurate to a novice like me","...picked the book because it seemed a good read on an historical cowboy character. I knew little of the details & circumstances surrounding the ""Gunfight at the OK Coral"". When I got to the chapter ""The Freemont Street Fiasco"" I presumed this skirmish was a precurser to the legendary fight at the OK Coral - only deeper into the book did I realize this chapter was in fact the OK Coral gunfight! Author Roberts, please keep in mind some of us are newcomers to this legend & need to be flagged when we're indeed reading about the famous gunfight at the OK Coral - ""The Freemont Street Fiasco"" is not what this gun fight is called. Otherwise, an informative, enjoyable read. Robert Morris / San Diego, Ca."
1,SHIPPING PRICE,You can buy this tea pot direct from Treasured Designs and save on the price and the shipping.
4,memories of How the West was Won,"I had an early vinyl copy of this,which I loved, long since lost and worn out, and I'm absolutly delighted that it's available on CD. Always loved Sheb Wooley's voice for this sort of music. Makes one think of the (mythical) West and provokes nostalgia for a lost (and in fact brutally hard)life led by some people in the not too distant past, for whom some of these sorts of songs were probably their only consolation while driving cattle. Only sorry that, in the UK, I probably can't get a copy."
5,Amazing Service!!,These seeds came by USPS 5 days sooner than the expected date! Not even UPS is that fast with my orders! Packaging and seeds in great condition. I can't wait to plant them and see them bloom!
2,Arthur's Tooth,"Arthur's Tooth by Marc Brown is a book that any kid that's about to loose a tooth would enjoy. In this story Arthur is the last to loose a tooth. He feels behind and awkward for it. Everyone tries to help him loose it, but nothing ever succeeds. Finally, Francine, the bully of the group, that hassles Arthur for not loosing a tooth yet, jabs Arthur in the mouth, and knocks his tooth right out!Arthur was my favorite character in this story. Arthur felt embarrassed that he had never lost a tooth before, and while everyone else was loosing their baby teeth, his was just getting loose. Poor, innocent Arthur. But at the end he shows them that he's no different. Read the book to find out the details!"
5,A peek at 100 years ago from a cyclists view,I received this book for my 60th birthday from a friend who knows I love all things related to cycle touring. The cycling part is great but what really got me was the perspective of 1909 from a bike. The author notes that it had been only 100 years before that Lewis and Clark had made their exploration. Now it's been another 100 years but I can identify with their every challenge.
5,Amazing Look Backwards,"For anybody going on bike tours this is a humbling book to read, and hard to put down. You can't help but root for two 18 year old boys who don't know enough not to make the trip. It also has special meaning for anyone who has ever driven all or parts of I-5 from San Francisco to Seattle. In 1909 it was possible to stay on the best road between California and Washington, and still get lost. Finally you get a feel for what life was like when my grandfather was alive. The postcards the two boys sent to their parents show buildings still standing today, but life was so much different. A good read."
3,Classic,"This is a classic, classic ski book and should be read as a historical reference, a milestone, but nothing more. The modern ski technique is vastly different and much more efficient for the newer shaped skis."
1,Not my style,"Received the product, did not like the quality and materials. Returned to Amazon for refund."
3,It's fine,"I wanted to own the Pokemon movies on DVD, but now, I think I made a mistake, because I decided to sell some of the DVDs."
2,Writer needs a good editor,Decent idea but Poloway needs help with the writing. This would make a great screenplay if somebody could decipher it.
1,I can't believe KitchenAid puts their name on this!,"Have had this blender for about 9-10 years now... It does such a terrible job at crushing ice it's not even worth using! I bought it because it was KitchenAid and assumed it would be a quality product like all my other KitchenAid appliances. It's not worth the counter space. I had a party one day and was going to make Margaritas and decided to go buy a cheapy $25 blender instead and it does a MUCH better job. I actually still have the Kitchenaid on my counter where it collects dust. While I was on here searching for a Vitamix I saw this and decided to give my opinion, take it for what its worth..."
2,Doesn't Do Ice,I had a previous version of this blender for 5-6 years of very light use. I started making protein smoothies with crushed ice and it pooped out shortly thereafter. The blade strips from the drive. Couldn't find a replacement. If this stripping is a feature to prevent burning out the motor then a replacement blade should be readily available. It didn't do an acceptable job of crushing ice anyway. I bought a 50$ Osterizer and it's a little smaller but does ice quickly and well without problems. Plus replacement parts are cheap and readily available.
1,Looks good but does not blend,"Yes that is the only problem...it does not blend. If you put items in that were first blended with an Oster then it would work. You can put in fresh strawberries and blend it for 10 minutes at any speed and there are chunks of fruit....always. This blender does not blend . Also, the pitcher ways a ton."
1,Very Dissapointing,"Purchased 4 years ago and used 10 times a year. Began to use 5 times per week January 2009, the rubber part that propels the blades began to slowly break off. The rubber completely broke off completely on July 02. Will Never buy Kitchen Aid again. I should have bought a vita mix from the very beginning."
1,Very disappointing,What is happening at Kitchen Aid? First my new toaster breaks and then my new blender? This blender is almost all high quality glass and metal but the one plastic part that holds them together shattered on mine after only about 10 uses. Now it's worthless unless I can order the part online and figure out how to fix it myself. Very disappointing.
1,Don't bother with smoothies,"I've had lots of blenders, cheap and expensive. This one's probabably the most over priced. If you are looking to make smoothies, forget this one. As many of the other reviewers have pointed out, it's worthless for chopping fruit. The blades are so dull, it actually beats the ingredients to (rather large) pieces instead of chopping them. Unfortunately, no other blades are available (the company told me they actually love the design). The top and bottom are very difficult to remove as well."
1,18 months to failure,"We have owned one of these for 18 months. It has never done a great job of blending our fruit smoothies, but my wife wanted it to match the other KA appliances. Yesterday it failed, while trying to chop up some frozen strawberriies & OJ. I removed the jar & saw that the teeth on the drive coupling had broken off. Take a good look at the drive coupling. Its made of a hard rubber. This is going to be a failure point if you buy this blender.I would recommend loooking at another brand."
1,Not Kitchenaid,"I have been using this product and think that it is a knock off. I have purchased other kitchen aid items before and none have worked this poorly. I tried to make a smoothy and the ice took a very long time to crush. I gave the kitchen aid I have previously purchased for double the price to my mom and thought this purchase would be a steal, instead I got what I paid for. This product should not have been endorsed with the kitchen aid logo. If it is kitchen aid it was defected."
2,a good 2 years owning one,"Almost two years since the purchase date to the day, the rubber teeth that make the blender blend starting breaking off, rendering it useless. So much for the one year warranty."
2,"Plenty of power, but short life span.","I purchased my KitchenAid a little over a year ago. Coincidence or not, the blade section has become very hard to turn just after the warranty ran out. I had decided that the justification for buying the (...)unit was that it would last a long time and individual replacement parts could be purchased if necessary. Only a little upset, I looked through my files and found the replacement parts insert that came with it. Eighteen dollars was the cost for the new part. After calling customer service, I was informed that they stopped making that part (only a year after I bought the thing) and as a consolation offered to sell me a whole new one. I told them I could get a Hamilton Beach at Target for (much less) that would last longer. I also looked on their webpage for replacement parts for their “new” model and they were not listed. My suggestion would be to go with a Cusiniart. It comes with a three-year warranty and ALL parts are orderable through their web site."
2,How to fix a shattered blender drive coupling of KSB5,"I tried to make a date smoothie and the metal blade jambed, but the motor kept going. when I took off the glass container I found that that vulcanized rubber blender drive coupling had shattered. I was able to chip the rubber away to reveal that inside it there was an aluminum disk. This was attached to a shaft sticking out of the casing. the shaft had flattened facets on each side which I gripped with thin wire cutters, and using a channel lock wrench turned the disc CLOCKWISE (this thing was reverse threaded). This revealed the threads at the end of the shaft. Then we ordered Modle # 9704230 from gourmet depot.net. We will hand tighten that by turning counter clockwise and running the blender should automatically tighten it. Good luck"
5,Quiet and Easy to use,"The blender works well. It is very quiet and easy to use. It is made of metal, not plastic like other blenders so it feels sturdy and durable. The cup is made of glass also. Not only does it look and feel durable, but it is also aesthetically pleasing. I am completely satisfied."
2,Disappointing for KitchenAid,"We purchased an earlier version of this model a few years ago. Ours gets infrequent use, maybe 1-2 times per month, maybe just a little more around Christmas.It has been a disappointment.The component that sticks out of the base and drives the blade quickly began to make a loose connection with the blade. Other than that it worked ok for about 3-4 years. Then all of a sudden it stopped working.This was at the time a fairly mid-high end unit, one which I would have expected many years of dependable use particularly at a low usage rate.I will avoid Kitchen Aid in the future for small appliances, and have begun to wonder about larger appliances, of which we own some."
5,Kitchen Aid Blender,I mix my Herbalife shake almost every morning it it for the last 10 years works wonderfully!
2,NOT FOR SMOOTHIES,I am very unhappy with this blender. My old cheap blender did a much better job with making smoothies. This blender does not puree a banana. I always have large chunks in my smoothies. It does not chop ice very well either. I should have returned it immediately.
1,Beautiful Piece of Junk,"It will last for 10 hours of use if you're lucky. Rubber gear on top will brake, but not hard to replace. Problem is the control board that goes bad and nothing but blinking lights when you turn it on. See the reviews for the white version of same blender for the same set of problems. Stay away from this one."
1,Terrible Blender,"I bought one of these and finally threw it out and bought a 2 speed Oster (a good blender) instead.I have other Kitchen Aid products that I like very much. They should either re-design their blenders or discontinue them.I bought one of these for my son and his wife for Christmas. They didn't tell me it was such a bad blender because they didn't want to hurt my feelings. So I bought one for myself, hated it, and then they confessed that they didn't like theirs either.Not only do they almost always leak at both ends and make a mess, they don't crush ice all that well and the berries in your smoothies will always be chunky rather than blended.Take my word for it, this is one you will not be happy with and it's overpriced to boot."
4,Seems to work well,"No problems so far, though for the price I might have expected a bit more industrial feel to the blender."
5,Impressed from NY,It was a pleasant surprise to buy a blender that justfied the price! I have had blenders in the past that didn't last or didn't perform but the kitchenaide has done an outstanding job no matter what I have used it for. The solid base and the shorter jar is great. I have a feeling that this investment will serve my family for years to come.
5,Great Blender,"This is a blender with real power. Crush ice, make a milk shake, or crepe batter..this is the machine to do it right. Comes in great colors too. I got the yellow. Who else offers you a yellow blender?"
1,Broken after 18 months- KA refused to fix,"I find that such a well-known brand would have a longer warranty than 12 months. My blender broke (it was the ""coupler"") after about 18 months of use. I emailed KA about it and all they did was give me two repair shops where I could pay to have it fixed. Both repair shops are more than one hour away. They also offered me [...] off a ""refurbished"" blender. Gee...what service. You'd think they'd at least work with me since the blender wasn't even 2 years old. For [...] I went out and bought a Cuisinart and that comes with a 3 year warranty. KA blender was not worth my [...]. It never blended fruit all the way, either; it always left chunks of bananas."
2,ugh!,"i agree that this blender isn't the best.if there is hardly any liquid in the blender (example, chunks of apple only) it will not blend it well. you will need to constantly stop and stir because it all gets stuck to the sides and even when it does because liquidy it still won't blend it well and takes forever.really frustrating! i would not buy this blender again."
1,Engineering Flaws make it a poor choice,"The blade is a poor design and has a hard time making margaritas. The coupler between the motor and the blades has shredded twice now, leaving parties hanging. Shoot the product manager, this is a poor excuse for a $150 blender."
2,save your money,"I bought this blender by name,we have a kitchenAid stand mixer that we love.but this is blender is a joke.We make smoothies 4 to 5 times a week,and this blender will not liquify a banana.We e=mailed there customer service and they said to blend the banana first on pulse ,so we did and the drink was still lumpy. This is one of the highest priced blenders out there. We went back to our $16.99 cheapy blender.At least it will liguify a banana."
2,Disappointment,"I have used quite a few Kitchen Aid products with good results. This blender, however, has proven to be a disappointment. The other day I put a banana in the blender with a good amount of orange juice. Then I put it on ""puree"" for a couple of minutes. When I poured the mixture into a glass, there were still a lot of banana pieces, the size of corn kernels, in the liquid. Heck, my old $29.00 Waring blender did a better job than this."
3,Kitchenaid Disappointment,"I purchased this blender a year ago and I was totally disappointed in the way it mixes and very loud. The black rubber that turnes the blades at the base has become quite the project when you try to clean it. The rubber sometime smears and very difficult to remove. I went and purchased the new Oster that just came out the other day, what a difference. So quiet and gets the job done much faster for the same price I paid for the KitchenAid"
5,Goes Beyond Expectations,"In Deciding whether to get a KitchenAID versus a cuisinart or a Waring I read all of the previous reviews as well as did a lot of research and asked around. Reviews seemed somehwat mixed but seemed to favor KitchenAID. I chose this blender and it has lived beyond my expectations.It's easy to clean and when you first turn it on it adjusts to the designated speed after starting at a slow speed. I mostly make smoothies and different kinds of drinks. It crushes ice, and fruit nicely. I had been using a cheap Hamilton Beach model prior to this and now I realize why people pay so much more for great kitchen appliances"
1,buyer beware,"We bought this blender a few years ago, going on brand name that was known for quality. However, we have been disappointed with this blenders performance. With light use of this blender only over 2 to 3 years time the blade assembly is now non-functioning. I called the company and they said I could order a new blade assembly for $25 and with shipping I was up over $30. I decided it wasn't worth it when I could get a new blender for that price, one that rates even better for less money. I was dissappointed overall, with the product and the customer service."
2,Deffective or poor,"I just bought this blender after months of looking for the best, but I guess I have to keep looking. This one does not blend properly, fruit stays on pieces after 5 min puree, even blueberries stay whole!!, so no drinking from a straw. It could be a deffective one, I am not sure I will replace it probably to check, but I doubt it. It seems like cheap plastic, cheap motor (very quiet, but does not do a good job) made in Mexico, etc. I don't like it. Even my Broun hand blender does a better smoothie for seconds."
3,"Great for a couple years, then fails","Mine works great. I use it daily to make smoothies for my daughter. It crushes the huge frozen strawberries and the fresh banana perfectly. I have no complaints and would buy it again/recommend it to a friend.Edited March 2011 to add: This blender didn't continue to work well. The teeth that are on the base and grab the jar and make the blade turn are made of rubber. After replacing them a couple times, it finally wouldn't work even once I put a new piece on."
4,Satisfied customer,Product as advertised except I miss the ginseng that was in the original.I am happy with the product.
5,Works just fine...,I'm using this for my amateur radio two-meter transceiver. I gave it five stars because it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do.
3,Under-powered for the price,It is a low amperage Power supply and there are cheaper ones on the market with 30 Amps for two thirds the cost.
5,It's Gator,"These work very well. We don't transport our drums much, but these bags are about perfect.We have Pearl Vision drums, overall the bags fit well, but not perfect. But that is to be expect with any general bags purchased (not made directly for a drum set)."
4,Great for the gigging drummer,Bought these for my Gretsch Catalina set. They provide great padding and are easy to carry along almost the entire set at once with the convenient straps. I have been gigging with these for a couple of months now without a scratch. I would have given them 5 stars but they are a little snug width wise. I have to wrestle the Bass Drum into it's case but other than that they are perfect.
2,Bass ripped out in a couple of gigs.,The strap started ripping off the bass drum shortly after my son started using it. Put he likes them okay other than that.
3,All covers do not fit,In the item description each case should be listed with size. Unfortunately all of the bags did not fit all of our drums. When you read the description it appears they all will fit. Two did not fit any drums we had so each of those are in a flannel sheet in a trash bag. Very disappointing.
5,Well written and clear,As a Wordperfect user I bought this to brush up my skills on MS Word. The practice exercises are clear and well laid out. For just $16 and a few hours of my weekend I came away with a few shortcuts.
5,very good resource,This book was very helpful in teaching me the necessary skills for Microsoft Office 2003.
3,Good resource!,"Great Resource Book, it is a big help to me. MY only issue is that it was missing the CD-Rom. Buying it used, you take a chance but without the CD, i cant do any of the practice files. : ("
3,Windows 7 Step by Step,"In the past these books have been excellent to learn from. However, I could not get the practice files to download nor could I get in touch with a live person to assist me with this problem. This was very frustrating. Thank goodness I had the experience with the previous editions of these programs or I would have really been lost."
2,"Book Good, CD Wrong",The book is in excellent condition but it came with the wrong CD. It was a library book so I'm sure that's why it was mixed up. However I wish the vendor had listed no CD rather than the wrong one.
2,As to the item's form but not its content...,"Thus far, I have only two warnings. First, the ink smudges easily. Second, I find myself preoccupied by the book's size: although its girth is evocative of Hume's corpulence, the pages from top to bottom are too short, and so hardly fitting for the words of such a towering mind."
1,Bad product,"the ones i bought from here are bad, they only lasted for a short while and they seemed as if they were used before. i got another pair from dell, they worked for a longer time."
2,Missing...,Aluminum side brackets as pictured were not included. Save your old ones. Not worth the hassle of returning or exchanging.
2,Disappointment,Paper makeup of filter causes it to decay quickly and this can block the drain line at the bottom of the humidifier causing it to leak.
5,Does what was needed.,I needed a power supply to run a CB radio and a car radio in my garage. This unit is powering both at the same time with no problem. It was just what I needed.
1,Absolute junk,"Sorry, folks, this is a waste of money. The threads on the positive terminal screw cap stripped the second time I hand tightened it. Looks like the threads were cut in really thin copper foil. Maybe if you're going to attach a terminal lug once and never touch it again it will work, but be very careful not to tighten the screw cap very much."
1,Nice Product But,"Price was great, shipping good, but it was DOA. Tried to expedidite a replacement but to no avail."
4,it works great but KNOW ITS LIMITS!,i bought this power supply and it worked great for almost a month but because i was using it to power a sub woofer amp when i turned the volume up it of course demanded more than the power supply could produce so it caused an overload NOTE-YOU CANT JUST HOOK UP ANY ITEM THAT SAYS IT RUNS 12V IT HAS TO HAVE A LOW AMP RATING because that is how this happens its not the power supply's fault it is only designed to handle so much. EXTENSION CORDS ARE NOT RECOMMENDED FOR THESE PRODUCTS.
5,Great sound for Musical Fidelity V-Can,"It works perfectly with the Musical Fidelity V-can and improves the sound a lot, clearer with better definition! It is like removing a veil from the sound."
4,Pyramid 12 volt power supply,I recieved exactly what I expected. The product works well and suits the need for which it was purchased. It did arrive slightly damaged but nothing a pliers and little paint couldn't fix.
2,Truth vs Falsehood,"I was a bit dissappointed with the contents of this book. I am a big believer in muscle (or kinesthetic) testing. But this book appeared to have more opinion than actuality. If you are purchasing the book out of curiousity about how the Hawkins researchers calibrate current events, this book is great. However, I think the claim of ""Falsehood"" in the title is not a valid position."
1,Pure Quackery,"Hawkins states that people in developing countries should be grateful for corporate exploitation. They would otherwise starve, he explains. He also rates WalMart has having extremely high integrity. Never mind the mistreatment of its workers for which WalMart recently paid millions to avoid going to trial. Never mind the exploitation of Chinese labor. Pure quackery, in which there is no verifiable means of testing beyond Hawkins' say-so."
1,Disappointed to say the least!,"I have been an avid reader of David Hawkins over the years but Truth Vs. Falsehood is a great disappointment on many counts. His personal viewpoints have been mixed into the Truth and it has me selling my copy and telling my friends to not buy it.Can you read around the obvious prejudices? Sure, but it has tainted my view of him and his Truth."
1,Falsehoods Instead of Truth,"I can't believe Hawkins can knowlingly publish obvious Falsehoods as Truth!p.31: How on earth can these ""Grazer and Exception"" animals calibrate higher than 75% of humans???p.114: Hawkins' comments on Bill O'Reily make NO SENSE... ""the rule of the thumb is that if O'Reilly dislikes a public figure or a ""cause"", it calibrates below 200 (handy for those who cannot do the calibration technique)"" So forget everything Hawkins has ever written based on kinesiology and simply watch Bill O'Reilly!!!p.115: How on earth can 2004 Election Republican voters calibrate at 405 and Conservatives calibrate at 415 - supporting Bush and the unwarranted war on Iraq while peace-wishing Liberals calibrate at only 255??There are many very questionable calibrations here and I couldn't read any more of this after reaching only page 124.This is a HUGE disappointment after Hawkins 3 previously enlightening books."
1,Save your money and your time,"I've read Dr. Hawkins previous books and, for the most part, enjoyed what he had to offer. Anyone with an ounce of social conscience (or anyone who enjoys NPR) best stay away. Ann Coulter finally has someone to support her nonsense."
5,Sometimes the truth is surprising,"As some of the other reviewers have noted, this book offers some surprises in terms of what it would seem to endorse. Specifically it uses Dr. Hawkins' Scale of Consciousness to calibrate everything from movies to the Iraq War. Some reviewers seem to be bothered that their own beliefs systems were not upheld by consciousness research. This is beyond silly. If the truth runs counter to my beliefs, I take it as an opportunity for self-reflection and change. Sometimes this is uncomfortable, but so be it. I'd rather have the truth than a cherished illusion. Personally, I love Dr. Hawkins' work and I enjoyed the hell out of this book, even when it offered unexpected results."
5,A most important read for our time!,"I'm a fan of Dr. Hawkins previous works, including video/audio works, but took a chance on this one, even though it had some negative reviews. I believe this is one of his most important works and one of the most important books in our society today. Dr. Hawkins reviews a significant amount of practical aspects of day-to-day living and helps shine the light of consciousness on these important daily living areas. I believe, having worked through the book, I understand why some of the reviews are a bit negative because some of the conscious calibrations are ""higher"" for some potential controversial topics...my understanding is that Dr. Hawkins is not attempting to say, ""this is good and that is bad""...but if you view this is his intent you may get a bit defensive. I found his book helpful, open, and very meaningful for me."
1,Disappointment and Outrage,I was enough impressed with Hawkins' Power vs Force and his The Eye of the I to begin using his technique myself as a non scientist. I gave Power vs Force to several friends. Fortunately I came upon Michael B's review which confirmed some of my experience in trying to use the device as well as disabusing me of much of my enthusiasm for Hawkins as a scientist. I am disappointed and outraged at the writer's ill disguised political bias in Truth vs Falsehood: How to Tell the Difference!
1,Conflict of interest,"After learning that the Hawkins foundation received a generous donation from the Republican Party my suspicions were validated.Unfortunately, we have all been duped into the ""inner development"" syndrome. We all want answers to questions of reality. What a better deception for those who wish to rule the world! Have you noticed the lack of a mass public outrage for any injustice, lately? The power elite has sufficiently dumbed us down into selfish mental masturbators.We are all vibrant creatures endowed with many gifts. Emotions are a wonderful tool for self expression. We are able to create and destroy with them. Kinesiology has it's basis in gut feelings. Don't you sense that something is wrong in the world?The movie ""The Matrix"" is a wonderful metaphor regarding the influence of how just a few awakened individuals can transform a society into a quest for liberation.We've been asleep too long...Its time to take the ""red pill""...Peace"
2,Very Disappointing!!,"I'm a big fan of Power vs. Force and was looking forward to this latest offering from Dr. Hawkins. Big disappointment!!I stumbled upon this wisdom within the body a few years back and have used it in my chiropractic practice since. It truly is an amazing biofeedback mechanism. Up until I read Power vs. Force I thought I was crazy. Power vs. Force was refreshing to me because it confirmed the existence of this communication pathway.However, the most important thing that I have learned while using this method daily for years is that you will get what you are looking for. If you are not careful in your questioning - you will get the answers that you want or expect. Single blind studies don't cut it. Try double blind tests - Bush doesn't come out looking as good as Hawkins would like us to believe & 2nd hand smoke is detrimental to our health.Dr. Hawkins, in my opinion, has fallen into this trap with this latest book."
1,God is a Republican?,"Do not buy this book!Hawkins now thinks Bill O'riley of Fox News is the moral compass of the world.Hawkins used to be a wise old man, but now he is senile and totally lost his mind.Do not buy this book!"
3,Seems like a great stone... But I'm not convinced yet.,This stone is a little confusing to me. It seems to be more dense than my 1200 grit in that it does not flatten or create a slur very easily. I also noticed that my 1200 stone seems to take more metal off. For reshaping an edge I have been skipping my 800 and going from 220 to 1200 to 6000 to a two sided Strop (both sides) and I get shaving sharp with a mirror polish finish.Perhaps I should revisit this stone.Note: I am still very new to this tradeskill. I will update this review if my opinion changes.
4,revisionism of history can be hazardous to your health,"Deborah Lipstadt writes an excellant book and documents how revisionism can be junk academics. She exposes many arguments and personalities used in Holocaust denial.I was intrigued about her expose on the origins of WW1 hisorical revsionism and its the impact on historical revisionism of WW2. She documents how bad academic scholarship and a willingness to absolve Germany can lead to disturbing nonsense . Holocaust revisionism has its origins in trying to absolve Germany from WW1 guilt. This should give pause to any revisionist historian when trying to disect and interpret the historical record. Lipstadt demolishes Holocaust revisionists. There is a need to always reinterpret a historical event -the Holocaust included but this needs to be done without trying to advance a nefarious agenda (i.e Hitler apolgia,anti semitism). The book will be an in important book cataloging the misuse of revisionism."
2,"the author is an activist, not an historian","nd as such, she fails to effectively argue her case, and lumps anyone who questions the facts and figures of the holcoast in the same category as neo-nazis. Our perspective on the Holocaust has been distorted by people who use it for political ends, and she doesn't seem willing to come to grips with that. Rather than rally around such propaganda, ask yourself this - why have we re-examined every other aspect of history except this one? When people become afraid to question history and the status quo, we are all in trouble."
1,Poorly Done,"This book is as others have stated an emotional plea rather than an academic work. Yes, I believe the Holocaust was a reality but this work only leads me into denial owing to the he said she said argument. Where are the facts, footnotes, and scholarship? I would pass this book over, a waste of time and money."
1,Worthless,"The appeal to motive is a well known logical fallacy. One cannot show that someone is wrong about a point of fact by showing that he has an ulterior motive. If ""holocaust deniers"" are factually wrong, their motives hardly matter. If they are right, again their motives hardly matter. Since Lipstadt's entire book is devoted to imputing ulterior motives to her opponents rather than debating them, it has no value.Even Lipstadt's characterizations of her opponents' motivations are inaccurate. She continually misquotes, distorts, and invents whatever is necessary to make her opponents look bad. Books like this are the reason the word ""screed"" was invented.For a fair assessment of the holocaust controversy, seeDebating the Holocaust: A New Look At Both Sides."
4,Hard to do fully,"This is an excellent book in explaining how people can continue to support a concept that is as fully discredited as anything in history. Ask our own army that liberated camps what they found. What more can be said if Amazon protects anti-semites' ""right"" to lie from honest discussion, especially when it is by anonymous cowards. I doubt this will see the light of day, but I agree with the author, having been grown when the war ended and the denial began in spite of the overwhelming evidence by both sides (including a huge amount of Nazi records)."
5,JUST PLAIN BRILLIANT!,"Deborah Lipstadt has more chutzpah than any Holocaust author I know...she's a real tiger for the truth and for exposing the reaches of hatred, both then and now. I can't recommend this book enough by a brilliant professor who always fights the good fight."
2,"I wanted to like it, but it fell apart.","Within 24 hours, the belt clip had broken and within two weeks, the mounting stud on the back of the case had broken off. Both parts were plastic and not very durable. The opening on the face of the case was also misaligned. About an 1/8th of an inch off causing the case to depress the buttons.The leather felt good and protected the PDA very well. Even with drops from waist high, there was no damage. Too bad the belt clip was so flimsy and the face did not align with the PDA."
2,"Good case for PDA, not SD cards","I bought this case from Best Buy. The case is ok, and seems to protect the PDA decently well (I have a Toshiba e310). I would have liked to see a further reenforced screen cover though. Some may like the belt clip included in it, but I do not. The fastener for the clip protrudes when it is in your pocket, and can get very annoying. Perhaps my biggest complaint of it is the storage pockets for credit cards and SD cards are useless. They are too tight to put anything in. I'll probably look for a new case when I get my SD wifi card."
4,A must-have for UltraFans!,"Those of us who grew up in the late 60's might remember a syndicated English-dubbed Japanese series that featured a red-and-silver giant battling equally-large monsters. The giant was ULTRAMAN.This tape features a made-for-TV animated movie made in cooperation with Hanna-Barbara, the studio that gave us everything from The Flintstones to Scooby-Doo to Yogi Bear. Here three American stunt pilots merge with 3 extraterrestrial defenders to help save Earth from the invading Sorkan monsters.With voices including Stacey Keach, Sr., Adrienne Barbeau, and Chad Everett, this feature gives classic Ultra-action with a definite American flavor. There are some pacing difficulties, including some scenes that seem to be shoved in at the last minute and obvious ""pauses for a commercial break,"" but the story is still pure Ultraman. END"
5,These briefs are lovely,"I really love these briefs because they are so soft and feminine, but they do run a little large. I would purchase them again because I like them so much."
4,Vanity Fair underwear,"good quality, covered elastic is a plus-very comfortable. Have tried others but keep coming back to these. Hard to find black in stores, black goes undisclosed under all garments."
3,ordinary,"Nothing special... Fabric quite ordinary, certainly not special.These panties are acceptable. Probably would not purchase again.Got just what I paid for...so be it!"
5,Great fun for my 5 year old,"My son recently got into these acceleracers. I wasn't really sure how this would work, but wow! We put in the batteries and this toy really has a great grip. It really goes and goes. Over blocks, legos, my foot, and almost up the wall before it fell over backwards. Once the weather gets nicer, my son is so excited to take it outside and watch it go. Overall, just a fun, non violent toy. Thank goodness."
4,Baby steps to public speaking,"When I bought this book I thought that it would be useful as a 'text' for a public speaking course I was taking. Turns out you should use it the way you use a religious text; little by little, day by day. It's not something you read through instead it's something that you use as a guide to improve over time. It's a great book but does require discipline on your part to practice what is suggested in the book."
1,Inferior quality book,"First, I didn't read this book since I returned this book immediately. So my review is based on the quality of physical book from TARCHER PENGUIN publisher.Amazon is currently selling the paper-cover version at two different prices. Worrying about the quality, I ordered the expensive one.When I received this book, I was surprised at horrible quality of this book.The paper cutting is done so poorly that I can't flip the pages properly; TARCHER PENGUIN seems to cut papers with hands and glued them.I attached the pictures."
1,It died way too fast!,"I purchased this battery at March 14, 2010. In last 2-3 months it started to show signs of weakening - quickly self discharging and can't hold capacity well. Yesterday, after full owernight charge with specified original charger, it was only to able to drive 3 screws into plywood.Very shame for a battery made in japan and costing $60!Just for comparison, in January I bought Black & Decker FS130 battery (which is same as dewalt, but 1.2ah capacity) and it still works flawlessly!"
1,Dewalt Battery,I purchased this battery from you and it will not hold a charge. I do NOT recommend this productRobert Richelson
3,Dewalt 12 Volt XRP Battery,When I first purchased these batterys (2) I thought they were great. They had more power then the ones that came with the drill and recharged in half the time. I use them at work for drilling into drywall and some screwing of #8 1 1/2 inch screws. After about 9 months of use they no longer will hold a good charge. I have always run them down completely before recharging them and have not abused them. They now only last about one hour before needing a recharge and if not used they go dead in about two weeks.
5,Battery out performs old,"this Battery was a replacement for an older Dewalt battery and it really outperformed the old battery. the price is high, but better than at the local Dewalt Store."
3,Not that great.,"I'm just your average home owner and own a DeWalt 12v drill and a Black and Decker 18V drill. My DeWalt is 2 years old and both batteries are FUBAR and my B&D is 5 years old and the batteries charge right up and last forever. Please note my B&D drill was a twenty dollar drill from Wally world. Am I missing something here? I'm going to see if Dewalt will cover these batteries under warranty since its still under its 3 year ""Limited"" warranty. I have no clue what ""limited"" entails and can find no explanation on Dewalt's website so I'm taking it down to their service center to find out the details. If they somehow screw me out of new batteries then I guess I'll be looking at Milwauki or Porter-Cable. Oh and FYI DeWalt is manufactured by B&D. We all own 200 dollar B&D's lol Google it!"
4,Dewalt Battery,"I have used my new battery in my cordless drill several times now and it has worked fine. The old one wasn't holding a charge for very long and needed to be recharged before use every time, but this one is ready to go everytime I need it."
3,"Decent battery, pleased with OEM","I knew what I was getting with this battery when I ordered, as its the replacement for my cordless drill. I'm pleased to buy an OEM battery, with confidence in quality, although this battery is big, heavy and doesn't last all that long in terms of holding a charge. I'd prefer the option to purchase lithium ion, instead of a ""dumb"" NiCd version."
4,Very satisfied,I'm very pleased with the efficiency of the service and the quality of the productThanksDEWALT DC9071 XRP 12-Volt 2.4 Amp Hour NiCd Battery
2,Works great when it works at all - Do not Hold up,"Do not bother, these simply do not last at all well, and are worse now than the smaller units that came with my drill. They start off so well, you actully have hope for improvement, but the satisfaction is very short lived, and within a year they simply fail to give you much working time. Not worth it."
5,Needed to replace old Battery,Needed to replace my old battery packs.. they lasted almost 5 years and I know these will last about the same. That is why I purchased the original Dewalt batteries. They cost a bit more but are worth it in the end. Purchased 2 of them and my original battery charger works perfectly with these new ones. Highly recommended!!
1,Consistently Poor Battery Life,"For what these Dewalt Battery Packs cost, they should at least meet their rated life. We have never gotten the kind of battery life that the ratings would make you expect. And neither has anyone else that we know. We are switching to Porter Cable, Bosch, Rigid and Ryobi. For the Dewalt cordless that we have, we are going to try non-Dewalt replacements as they cannot be any worse and they are a heck of a lot cheaper."
4,Prompt delivery and product as advertised,"Just started using this new battery but it seems to be performing just like the unit it replaced. That unit lasted 2 1/2 years of hard use. The price, including shipping, was very fair and noticably less that than the local Home Depot price."
5,Dewalt and Amazon.com Rock!!!,The new Nickel Cadmium Batteries work better and last longer than the original Dewalt 12-Volt Batteries I received with my Drill/Screw Gun 12 years ago. Hopefully the charge will hold up longer over time too. Thank you Amazon for the great price too!
1,DeWalt Battery DW9071,Idont know where you guy's get your battery's but they suck they can't hold a charge and do you know how hard it is to try to return them I thought I was buying new one's you sent me recontioned battery's oh then I get a Email from theses guy's saying the charger is bad what's up with that?
2,thin,"thin bargin zip ties at not so bargin price. if you need heavier duty zip ties, probably best to shop elsewhere."
1,Wireless mice suck,"I'm trashing this thing and going back to the cord. It burns through batteries in days, not months. To make matters worse, Logitech tells us NOT to use rechargeable batteries for reasons I still don't understand.My computer is only a few feet away yet I always have reception problems between the mouse and the computer if my hand or arm is between the two. Sometimes the cursor just stops for no apparent reason and needs a reboot. I deal with that enough using Windows, thank you.If that's not enough, this mouse in particular is way too small and skinny for my hand. I'm already starting to feel some pain from the awkward way I end up holding it. Seems like it was designed for little kids. Sorry Logitech. I've used a corded Intellimouse for years and I'm going back to it."
3,Cheap because it has a large transmitter,This mouse is cheap because it has a large transmitter. If you are looking for a tiny usb plug in you will be disappointed.
4,this is 1st book i read by gayle wilson and not the last,This was the 1st book I read from gayle wilson and not the last. I am going to at least read the other two sinclair borthers stories.
4,Problems with installing and playing the games,"The DVDs and CD arrived promptly and appeared to be in good condition. I installed the ICEWind Dale DVD and the game played well. Upon trying to install the Heart of Winter Expansion CD, it could not be read by my computer. I tried a few times but it did not recognize the CD. I installed the ICEWind Dale 2 DVD and my virus protection software detected a Trojan and automatically removed it. A scan of the DVD with my virus protection software did not reveal any problem. Upon trying to play the game it kept quiting at certain points saying there was a problem and it had to close and wanted to send a report to Microsoft which I would not allow. I thought perhaps a file was missing or corrupted and tryed to reinstall the software. During the reinstallation process my virus protection software again detected a Trojan and automatically removed it. I have not been able to play the ICEWind Dale expansion or ICEWind Dale 2."
4,Be warned with Windows 7,"I've always been a big fan of Infinity Engine games from Bioware and Black Isle. I decided to take a trip to the past and pick up these games. I don't think I have tried to load up such old software on a new machine. So be advised - if you are running Windows 7 then you'll need to a do a little tweaking to get them to run consistently. So far, they seem moderaltly stable using compability setting of Windows XP w/service pack 2. If you don't know unsure who to adjust this then consult your windows help and you can find a guide. Also, the quick save feature seem to cause crashes over the normal save and load options.There are other patches and suggestions out there to increase stability but I think they may be unnecessary or at least for me they were.In short, great fun games - just need a little help on new machines."
4,Still so good,"I played IWD some years ago and enjoyed it a great deal. Having given away the game to a friend, I decided to order the bundle of three disks. I loaded up the first disk and heart of winter and then began to play... It was like visiting an old friend. The story is engaging, the mechanics easy to master, plenty of strategy and you feel connected to the party you creat right away. The graphics are old school but still serviceable. I highly recommend."
1,Doesn't work on modern computer,"These games do not work on a modern computer. I can not start a game both games install fine and I get to the game menu but after that I get an error telling me ""Can not connect to game session"" when I am trying to play in single player. I get the same error message in both IWD and IWD2 I read some articles online, beacuse the readme has not been updated since 2000, and they suggest I have to roll back my direct X software, which I am unwilling to do. I also find it bothersome that the publisher did not bother to include the most recent patch which was released in 2000.The package says it is compatable with Vista and XP. I am running Vista but my direct X is not compatable with this and the support for this product in nonexistatant.Try the other IWD, IWD2 heart of winter on DVD. This product is published by [...] which seems to be a UK company and I am unsure if this is a UK product."
3,Hard to use and lacking in features,"This remote works, but the LCD screen is hard to use, you don't get the same feedback from it as you do from ""real"" keys.It also cannot do macros, which is a handy feature on most of the One for all remotes.The learning functionality is good, but limited to only certain keys.The assigning and reassigning of keys is inflexible when compared to the One for all remotes.I ended up returning this remote and getting a One For All URC8811 for less money and a lot more flexibility and features."
2,You get what you pay for,"As another review mentions... no MACROS!The LCD buttons don't really work.I do love the learning feature, I was able to program it to handle my iPod remote control! Battery life is good, might not be be for everyone."
1,Wish I had known,How awful this remote was brefore I purchased it. Philips dosen't even carry any support at their website!
5,Tokyo AMajin,This is one of thoes rare titles tht just leaves you wanting more and more. I is a totalt unique title that reminds you of classic titles like Yu Yu Hakusho so if you love super natural animes with lots of butt kicking action this one is for you.
5,"Zombies, daemons, and martial arts!",It is not the most amazing show ever but you get to watch high schoolers beat up zombies and whatnot so it's a great way to spend a afternoon!
4,A book to remember,"I read this book about 30 years ago, and now that my own daughter is old enough, I found myself remembering it. I loved it then, and I would love my daughter to be able to read it too. This is surely the mark of a successful book! It's about some children who find an old cooker, and with it, an old cookery book, which cooked up more than they expected! A magical story in both senses."
2,Cheaply made.,Spend a couple dollars more and get something worth it. It works but the brush wont last long. The so called hair is falling out and laying flat. It's 6 or 7 months old now and i'm looking for another one. Save your money
2,Took 3 tries,"First two shipments were broken, although the packaging appeared undamaged. The units may have been broken before packaging?? Have not yet tried the sound."
1,Please keep looking,"In order to install this you have to remove the grill, should not be a big deal. After about 1/2 hour and a utility knife I was able to remove the grill but destroyed it in the process. I am not an expert in audio by any means but this speaker did not sound good. I now have a complete in wall speaker theater with midlevel Polk speakers that is 100% better than the Pyle. Please shop around before you purchase this."
1,Poor Quality,"This product is a very poor quality item. The cut out size is incorrect. But I could work around that aspect. The bigger problem is the supplier (Restockit) of the speaker, the worst customer service ever! Basiclly a zero day warrenty."
3,Beware,"As a previous review stated, broken on arrival. Packing was not damaged.Had to send back twice before I received one I could use.Plastic was cracked in several areas.Sound is ok.There are better products out there."
4,Return to the Saturday matinee,"If you like returning to yesteryear and remembering spending Saturday mornings and afternoons watching your favorite heros do battle with the evil villians, you will love going thru this book. It is a great addition to the video "" The Republic Pictures Story"". You will be able to find date of your favorite cliffhanger serials releases, how long they actually ran and even if there were sequals. Go visit with your heros like Commander Cody, Zorro, Jungle Girl and the G-men. Have fun returning to the Saturday morning serials from Republic Pictures."
1,The Republic Chapterplays,"It was a good thing that I did not pay the full $39 for this book as I would have felt terribly cheated. As it was, this little paperback book cost me $28 and was only worth about $8. The quality of the pictures in the book were terrible. The information provided within the book was nothing spectacular either. I was thoroughly disappointed. Once again I am reminded to touch and see the things I want before I purchase them."
5,Quickly Responsive!,"I had to sign for this item, and made special arrangements to do so while at work. Love the way the vendor took care of the product until I was able to get it. I really appreciated that. Would definitely purchase from this vendor again."
5,It even comes with a small Nagura stone.,"6000 grit makes knives razor sharp, and it even comes with a small Nagura Stone!I have only had this stone for a day but it has taken my knives to a razor precision. I am a Chef and have been slowly adding Japanese steel to my collection through the years.This stone is meant for final sharpening with high carbon steel blades and should in no way be considered for German, French, American, or even some Japanese Molybdenum blades. I use it specifically for my high carbon Japanese knives.Creates a great slurry and wears very evenly.For the money, you really can't beat it, this stone combined with an 800, a 1200, and a nice steel works great for a very sharp knife!"
3,6000 grit stone works. 5 stars if it did the sharpening work for me...,"Stone works. It gets 3 stars because it does it's job. If it sharpened edges for me, well, shoot, I'd give it 5 stars no sweat. I hate the base, and really wonder why the very fine stones get glued to a funky chunk o' wood."
4,best of previous CDs,"Finally, she is playing again at what she does best...modern music. Her style is much more mature now, and richer in taste and selection. Whenever Vanaessa Mae attempts to play classical music, there seems to be great lacking of soul and spirit, something like Becky Taylor when she sings structured songs like ""bluebird"". Handel here seems pretty decent to me."
5,True Heavy Metal Lives-Vengence Rising!!!!,"Vengence Rising is in True Heavy Metal form.The lead guitarist(Anthony Maglio)shreds, with killer harmonies and amazing virtuosity. The vocals are pure with heart. The vocalist(George Tsalikis) voice is in top form with a lower register than the previous album, however you can expect the searing high notes and occassional metal screams. The Bass and Drums are tight, pure adrenaline from start to finish!!! Sonically, this album sounds amazing. Pump this album on your speakers or headphones and you will hear a great mix, and all the dynamics and frquencies of all the vocals and instruments.In summary...This album Rocks!!!!"
5,Metal-icious,"I do not normally listen to metal albums but this has become one of my fav cds. I even put the songs in my 'gym' work out mix, my 'I have to go sit on the subway for 10 hours' mix and of course my 'I'm walking down the street don't mess with me' mix. It really in powers the listener. That's what I love about it. It gets into you. And ok I think those vocals are so sexy!"
5,"Hey, look who reviewed!","I don't know which member from the band it is, but a band member from Zandelle reviewed this album...that's awesome!Uh, yeah, this album rock pretty hard....this stuff is as good as any power metal band from Europe! These guys are WAY underrated. Necromancer is amazing, but the whole album rocks. So, listen to it. Oh yeah! and the cover's great..look at the band's artist(on the left) cheering on an epic viking while he rocks a monster's world...with his fist."
5,"This book give you the best ; Theory, and practical too.","George Box and Alberto Luceno give you the best advice you need for Engineering Process Control (EPC) and SPC theory in this 300 page book. New methods, such as Cusum, and EWMA are also explained. Enough knowledge for a practician and more if you want in detail. They don't bore you by deriving equations you care less. I am an engineer in manufacturing and know when I need to study an equation or accept it as correct. In year 2000's, SPC and EPC will be emphasized in manufacturing even more than ever. Engineering process control has benefited from SPC in an exponentially growing rate. My motto is ""SPC is the blood test of the manufacturing process control - S. Can"". I recommend this book to all practicians of EPC."
4,Superceded by Bailey/Gates Smart Eating,"Great principles. No one cares about Bailey units, however. The book has been superceded by Smart Eating by Bailey and his associate, health promotion educator, Ronda Gates. In addition to an update of Target Diet Principles Smart Eating includes 200 quick-to-fix great tasting recipes that are keyed to the Smart Eating Target concept"
4,A valuable resource for anybody already familiar with CFML,"There are plenty of ColdFusion books available, unfortunately many of them just follow the same structure, trying to cover ColdFusion from start to finish (often ending up as around 1000 pages). While those books can be just fine for the beginners, they offer very little value to the experienced developer. This is the first ColdFusion cookbook to ever hit the market, and it's a pretty good one, providing practical solutions to common problems. I am giving it 4 stars out of five only because I would expect more in depth coverage of certain topics, for example, the chart section lacks details and RegExp are barely covered (hidden inside the string handling chapter). Although 50-100 additional pages with more advanced recipes are missing from this book, it's still a valuable resource for anybody already familiar with CFML"
1,Other texts are deeper,"We got the book for a course in Introduction to Networking. The only thing the teacher could say was, ""I wish that GWU didn't require this book, there are better, and cheaper at that."" It really does not deliver in detail. It is just a superficial vision. Skip it if possible."
1,Def not a good book!!,I and many others in my IT Management program were forced to buy this new text book for our intro to telecom course. All I can say about this book is that it is far to broad!Didn't teach me anything new!!
2,Weak. Lacking technical detail.,"Recommend a pass on this text. Good overview, but far too broad, and lacking in essential detail."
3,Excllent customer service,"I learned about this product from a German friend. It is an excellent product. When i ordered it, they shipped me the normal, not the extra strong (extra stark). I was disappointed, and when Smallflower found out about it, they contacted me, gave me a guarantee that if I did not like it, they will pay for the shipping and give me a full refund, and overall demonstrated outstanding customer service."
1,MGM,I can't remember what this was about but if I can't remember then it must have been not good at all...
5,Hola colegas!!,Este disco es redondo. es un recopilatorio de las mejores canciones de la banda. Si eres un fan del Hard-Rock es indispensable que te hagas con el. Escuchalo y vas a flipar...
4,Pretty Good,"Over all, pretty good, but the better tracks come later in the CD. If track #15, Damp Carpet doesn't get your feet moving...You must be dead. Vocals are a bit muddy, drums are muted to, but worth the money if you play the tracks in reverse order."
4,Great Message Machine Recording For Country Life,"I actually heard a recording of a cow mooing on an answering machine used by a farm equipment business so much that I wrote to them and asked if they sold the recording at their store....They referred me to this CD, which I am going to use for my own message machine at home...I believe my 6 year old daughter will also enjoy listening to all of the animals as part of her bedtime ""calm down"" routine....Very relaxing and ""country-fied"""
3,teenagefrankenfurter,everything good here xcept needed lil more monsta action; all i can say for now.
3,Sure why not??,"When you start to run out of ideas for the popular 'Frankenstein' character, put yet another twist on it. In his lab/office another mad docor brings yet another corpse to life, this time a teenage male. For those who discovers his grissly secrets, or for his failed attempts, he has a catch all solution. A dumb-waiter door on his wall falls into an alligator pit. Witnesses and body parts fly down there quicker than you can say 'Boris Karloff'.The doc keeps his creation in a filing cabinet. When he opens the drawer he sits up. Pretty high tech huh? He doesn't even lock it. That's when the witnesses get there first glimpse. Scares the hell out of those secretaries, that's for sure.Too bad this didn't start a whole new series......a. I was a Teenage Frankenstein's Prom Dateb. I was an unemployed Teenage Frankensteinc. Teenage Frankenstein goes to boot campd. Teenage Frankenstein's Girlfriendc. Teenage Frankenstein gets acne.It could have gone on... and on... and on..."
1,Fiction,"The Amazon bio for this author says:""Michael Bowen is an attorney with a deep understanding of American politics and has author many books of fiction.""This book isn't supposed to be a work of fiction, but that's how it comes across. The 2008 election showed how wrong he was."
3,essential elements,book is a good beginners guide for my 10 year old. recomand for all starting music lessons.
4,"Good, but with one caution","This book is a good introduction for the newcomer. It contains much useful information, including a discussion of health benefits that is not overstated. The price is right, as well. My only complaint is the implication that there is a right way and a wrong way to sauna. With regard to maximum measurable health benefits, the author may be correct. However, half the magic of the sauna is developing a routine that is comfortable and enjoyable. While I recommend this book, I would also encourage others to visit the Finnish Sauna Society's website, or Mikkel Aaland's website entitled ""Sweat"". Using his name as a keyword should get you there. In this way the reader can review the many aspects of the sauna. Enjoy!David Prescott"
1,Content Free Reading,I found this book basically content free as I was looking for a book that would give me in depth details of the health benefits of sauna and how to use it most effectively. Buy this book if you know nothing about sauna and don't really care if you learn anything more than the varieties that are available.
2,Nothing here that a couple of minutes with google and wikipedia wouldn't give you,"Not content-free so much as basic-beyond-belief. There's nothing wrong with the book's contents, but it's a mighty thin effort to get our money when so much more information is only a click or two away."
3,A good but not great book,"This book contains images of a lot of Packard models that I hadn't seen before, some of them quite rare. In that sense it's an excellent book, and it's good to have so many cars shown in a relatively inexpensive paperback. Precisely because it's inexpensive, however, little or no effort was made to enhance the quality of the photos. Such improvements, mainly in adjusting the brightness and contrast, would be easy to do in Photoshop today, although more difficult when the book was published in the mid-'90s of course. Enhancements to the photos would have added tremendously to the value of the book; this is shown by comparing the enhanced cover image with the unimproved photo of the same car and scene on page 25. For the reasonable price, however, it's hardly fair to complain too much."
4,double image,"Vampires, ghosts and fast paced action. What's not to like?The next book in the series is even more incredible.Don't know why I haven't heard more about Jaye Roycraft."
3,COOPER WIRING DEVICES INC #BP1008 Button Flasher,"I bought two of these flashers a while back. They were both individually packaged, but one came through with the outer plastic case separated in two pieces, so I epoxied the halves back together and it works as it should, but they are indeed very cheaply made. I noticed that there is about a 10-second delay before the light will even turn on when first energized, while these warm up and then begin to flash. The flash rate is pretty fast, so when working it will most definitely get noticed, but it kind of looks to me like something you might find flashing outside a house of ill repute. These buttons were a snug fit for a standard Edison base socket, but a little push with a wooden dowel and it went in and bottomed out in the socket, so the bulb could screw down enough to make contact. These flashers work as described, but if they weren't so cheaply made, I probably would have given them another star."
2,Button flasher,"Received the order promply, open the package and removed both buttons. Well they fell apart in my hands.Had to tape the two halfs to hold them together."
1,Barrows Dunham,"Wow, this is strange...I typed in ""Heroes and Heretics"" looking for the book published in 1964: ""Heroes and Heretics: A Political History of Western Thought,"" by Barrows Dunham. He also wrote a book called ""Man Against Myth,"" published in 1947, and several others. Dunham was a progressive thinker whose grandfather had led a regiment of freed slaves during the Civil War, and Dunham himself attained a Masters and Ph.D. in Philosophy from Princeton, and served as a professor and Dean at Temple University. Sounds very different from this book."
2,"Sig P250 ""fits"" but not really good. (Tight!!)","While my Sig P250 ""fits"" it's too tight IMHO. I'll be cutting off the rivets, putting in some stainless screws and washer spacers.Also, I don't care for the plastic casting nub that is exposed on the inside that I feel is too close to rubbing on the side of my gun on every draw.I'm NOT very impressed."
3,Sticks a little!,"This is a very convenient holster. It can be mounted without removing your belt. The only issue is it is too tight! I loosened the screws with no success. If you are into leg holsters for this model sig, make sure you purchase nylon and small to medium size."
3,Last Fobus product I'll buy,"This holster pales in comparison to my Bianchi, and it is not only flimsy but requires major effort to put the gun into, then pull the gun out. Two hands are definitely required, and the old maxim applies here about 'you get what you pay for'. I will be ordering another Bianchi for my revolver."
4,Works... And works great!,"By the way, I did order and received the SP11B which is a right side holster for a belt, not as shown a paddle holster. When I first received the holster, my Taurus PT99 fit way too tight. After leaving the pistol in the holster, it stretched the plastic material and now has the proper friction to keep the sidearm in place during any kind of physical activity including a scuffle and also prevent accidental acquisition by an assailant.It is exactly what I wanted and I believe the design and performance is perfect for concealed carry."
4,Fobus -compact holster,This product is OK not sure how much I will use it but the firearm does fit in it.Has too much of cant.Could have gotten it for less other places.
3,Good but not great.,"Pros:AdjustableFits both of my .45 Taurus Autos PT945 and PT145PRO MILLENIUM(with adjustment)Seems durable and well made.After propper adjustment, provides decent balance between retention and drawing ease. Was able to hold loaded guns upside down and shake moderatly (over couch) without either gun falling out.Cons:Does not fit my PT145 as well as I'd like, and it rubs pretty agressively on the foward/top end of the slide. It holds the gun tightely but it is a ""sloppy"" fit with only a few points really holding the gun in place. With repeated use I fear those same points would rub the finish off of this gun (PT145)Over all you can tell that this holster was not really designed with the Millenium Pro in mind. It works, but has issues.It seems to be a much a much better fit for the PT945. It's a little loose (and noisey) but the holster will fit, and retain the gun after proper adjustment of the screw. I'll get a different holster for the PT145 and use this one for the Larger PT945"
5,Taurus pt111 millennium pro,"I was skeptical when ordering this holster for my 3rd gen pt111 mil pro because it was not molded specifically for my gun, but the fit is excellent. High quality holster great for around the house or the range but definitely not for concealed carry. It rides comfortably in the 3-4 o clock position and doesn't jam the gun into your sides. The one thing I did note about the holster is the loaded chamber indicator will cut the interior plastic as it is not molded for one. Other than that I highly recommend this holster for the Taurus pt111 mil pro"
4,Fit My Needs,"Works great with my Sig Saur P250! Comfortable to wear, I did have to adjust it to accommodate my Sig but that was easy.The flat profile makes it great for outside the waistband conceal carry with a light jacket or shirt."
5,"Tunes to go with your dram, or to keep you amused and calm","My first listen of this came in the height of the holiday shopping season, stuck in gridlock in a parking lot of a large mall. I had noticed the lack of movement before I got in my car, and took care of those things known to cause anxiety (food, water, calls made) in gridlock.I saw a lot of drivers cursing, but I had a smile on my face, if not a giggle in my voice.I first heard about this album as Robin Laing was touring Canada...on a music list dedicated to Canadian music. I was quite grateful to hear of it.If you love a good dram of singlemalt, you'll want this album, as it celebrates the spirit of the spirit, as it were. It gives a bit of history, a litany of drams in two of the songs, and a lot of whimsy.Robin Laing has a lovely voice, and I expect I would enjoy listening to him live, and hearing the stories the first reviewer describes."
2,"Good design, but drive was defective",I really liked the design of the flash drive. Complete rubber outside in which the flash drive slides into the center. Completely protected on the sides against impact. The large loop means it wont break off on your keychain unlike many other keychain style flash drives. My problem is that when retrieving large files off it many times the files would state they are corrupt. Even though the original file was fine. This only happened when I transfered files on this flash drive. All other flash drives I have are fine. Smaller files work fine. Tried reformatting it but to no good.If the drive isnt reliable its serves as no use to me. Maybe I just got a lemon drive. You may have better results.
2,"Very, Very Slow","This by far my slowest USB flash drive, bar none. And yes, my system supports USB 2.0 and the system log identifies it as a high speed device."
5,2GB Clip Flash Drive USB 2.0,"Exactly what I needed for my Computer Forensics class. The ""write-protect"" feature is absolutely needed in a forensics class and it works great."
3,Meh.,Its a really nice piece but I was expecting it to be fully enclosed by the rubber and also its poorly designed it should have been able to slide out like the most cruisers so that you dont have to take the flash drive out of its rubber shell.
3,Flash Drive,"If you dont want to lose your flash drive, this is a great product. It is a little difficult to remove from my PC but I definitely will not lose it."
4,Excellent Product,"So far, I've been happy with this product. It showed up at my door within the time they specified and it has worked without any issues.I do like the rubber shell. I have been using it on my keychain, instead of the carabineer it came with."
4,Lots to offer. Take what you will.,"Freemasonry describes itself as ""a science of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols"". This book is a clear example of that definition. All Masons, and even non-Masons, are free to make as much or as little of Freemasonry as they wish. MacNulty's Jungian approach is an interesting new expression of mystical Freemasonry. Deep mysticism or self searching, however, has never been of interest to the majority of Masons, who get a lot out of their Masonry in other ways. Even if you have no taste for the ""woo-woo"", this book is worth it just for the pictures."
3,Not for metal roofing,"I just bought a 5 year old house that has a common metal roof with overlapping panels. Some were not installed properly so I went looking for more information. This book has a chapter on metal roofing, but it is like an afterthought and doesn't delve into the various types. Except for the standing seam type, there is no detail on the joining of common metal roofing in use today. Why the author devotes 6 pages to thatched roofing and only 5 to metal roofing befuddles me."
1,Problem after problem with a finicky little drive,"I love the way the drive looks but it's just finicky and continues to fail. When I initially got it, it died after just a week or two. I sent it back and got a new one pretty quickly. The customer service wasn't bad. Even when it worked, some computers would see the drive, others wouldn't. It was a crap shoot. Then, I tried to reformat the drive and it wouldn't; it just became unformattable. Apparently there's nothing I can do because Pexagon doesn't have any drivers that I can download and reinstall. So, this drive, which had so much potential, has just been plagued with problems and is now just a $100+ hunk of metal. I am waiting on customer service yet again to solve the problem. Will report back how it goes."
4,"Great device, makes backing up files so much easier!","Do you back files up onto CD's? If so, you really need to get one of these and chunk your old method.The Pexagon Store-It 60 GB external drive has taken what was a 3 day monthly backup process using CD's (I back up my files and my colleagues critical files) to a 1 hour per month process.I am only giving it 4 stars because while I am able to get it to work on my office PC and my laptop, I cannot seem to get it to work on my home PC. Also, the software that comes with it is not exactly intuitive. That said, you can treat this device like an extra ""drive"" in Windows Explorer to just drag and drop file copies onto it. It is fast and simple to use, and sleek and compact.I would recommend this for both work and personal use if you have newer PC's (3 years old or less) to use it on. It has greatly simplified my life."
2,Better luck next time,"Followed the instructions when using the stone, used it for 30 minutes and it did absolutely nothing. My neighbor has a standard oil stone which works great. I sharpened all my 7 kitchen knives with his in 30 minutes."
5,wet stone,"This is very fine wet stone. Requires care in use. If you are a person who just wants to sharpen your knife in 2 seconds this product is not for you. For one this it is recommended that the stone is placed constantly in water, or at the very least for 15 minutes before every use. You cannot use oil on this stone because it will ruin the stone (thus the name). On the positive side it sharpens the knife very finely and I have very good experince with it thus far."
3,"1200 grit stone works, but it's just a stone",I needed something between 800 and 6000. This stone fills the gap pretty well. I may end up getting something like a 3000-4000 if I'm suffering from over-enthusiasm. The price was good.
1,Most despicable Liar and Human Being,"You really have no clue... McClain is and was much worse than the events portrayed in the trial. He is such a liar they immediately took this book of the market.I was a witness in the trial and McClain is one of the intelligent people you would ever meet: Street smart, magnetic personality, could light up a room.He is just the most despicable liar and human being on the planet.He is worse than a common thief and ruined may people's lives including his family.He would steal the money out of his mothers purse and tell her his brother took it.He would rather climb a tree and lie than stand on the ground and tell the truth.He had no remorse. He immediately bought a meat packing plants pension fund and managed to ruin more lives.Opps jail time number two...... But he was railroaded again, right?????"
1,The Story of Denny McLain,"From his organ playing to his drug dealing,this book paints a heart wrenching story of one of the biggest losers next to Barry Bonds.Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Much less than what I expected,"I bought this CD after reading praise reviews at PerfectBeat.com and sampling the songs figuring getting this compilation will eliminate the need to buy certain singles. Some great songs included here like hard-to-find Deborah Cox song from Aida, Monica's ""Get It Off,"" Benni Benassi's ""Illusion,"" LMC, Narcotic Thrust, ""Summer Jam,"" etc. However, many songs have been butchered by jumping to vocal parts and skipping the instrumentals (which are in the mixes for a reason, othewise radio versions would be just sufficient). The transitions seem rushed. I totally agree with some other reviewers that transitions are not smooth and especially that the sound quality is very very poor. For the lack of a technical term, the sound is just flat, as if the disc is recorded in mono.I would not stay long on a dancefloor if this mix was playing. I am so glad I bought this CD used."
1,poor,"I'm a great fan of Louie DeVito and also bought all of his cds but i wont buy this one because the songs are old fashioned, they were passed from the dancefloors so i think he was drunk when he choosed the playlist... but i know he is the best and he will be back with a great new cd as soon as possible..."
3,Disappointing Work For Such Good Songs,"You see songs such as ""Easy as Life"" and ""I Like It"" and ""Get It Off"" and ""If I Close my Eyes"" and you expect greatness since this is mixed by Louie Devito. It is almost as like Louie has become the Yankees of Dance DJ's. Anything less than a perfect cd with every song being a big hit and the mixing to be flowing perfectly is considered a failure just like when the Yanks make it to the World Series but lose. This cd rates right now as like the Yankees making the playoffs for another year. You know it was going to happen just like you know Louie's cd will be decent. However, if the Yanks don't win the World Series I will be upset because they have spoiled me for a decade now, just like Louie spoiled us in the past with NYC Underground 1,2,3,4 and Dance Factory. This cd is still better than most out there and only gets three stars because I know Louie is capable of so much better mixing."
1,Louie Devito: Dance Factory 3,This was one of the worst albums I've heard. Very disappointed as I am a big fan of Devito's music.
2,"Good song selection, production quality is not good...","The song list is good. You'll recognize many of the tunes. Probably my favorite track is ""You Promised Me"" by Ingrid. Compared to DFL1 and DFL2, though, the production quality stinks. The dynamic range of the songs and/or the stereo separation seems to have been compressed. At times, you wonder if you're listening to a mono CD. I bought this on the first day of release - now, I wish that I had been able to preview the CD before purchase."
2,Deluxe edition has some hard to get mixes-but all edits!,"Sure, it's great to get on CD Deborah Cox, Monica, Wynonna, and Angelo Venuto's Sweet Carolina, which was added exclusively to this ""deluxe"" edition of Dance Factory level 3 (unfortunately, it's the version that doesn't include this song that is not censored lyrically)...but as most of these commercial mixes do, you are given a lot of tracks in short versions. If you're looking for longer versions of many of the hard to get tracks, stick to series like Party Groove, Global Groove, and Masterbeat. Track times here are:1. pump it up (5:05)2. Get it off (5:10)3. Easy as life (4:58)4. If I close my eyes (3:42)5. illusion (4:36)6. you promised me (4:00)7. take me to the clouds (6:21)8. F**k it (4:15)9. summer jam 2004 (4:08)10. calinda (4:43)11. sanctuary (4:09)12. I like it (6:23)13. just a little more love (3:59)14. never be alone (4:35)15. love comes again (5:15)16. sweet caroline (4:29)17. I want to know what love is (3:27)"
2,Dance Factory - disappointing,"If you're into paying for what you can mostly listen to on the radio for free - this is your CD. The first 6 songs are very straightforward - a weak drag and drop of today's so-so tracks. You will not be impressed.Summar Jam 2004 on a dance CD? What an unbelievable waste of space. I'm glad this was a loaner.The only reason the CD gets an additional star is because of tracks 10-Calinda, 11-Santuary, & 15-Love Comes Again. Tiesto is amazing, in Central Park NYC in September, and really works the crowd.Louie Devito would do well if he included more DJs of his caliber in his mixes. This CD is worth +/- $4."
3,A rehash,"I am a physician, and recently used the previous (10th) edition as an overview for a presentation I was preparing on opioid analgesics. We just got our new, 11th edition, and I embarked on a comparison of the chapters. To my astonishment, despite the considerable ongoing research in opioid pharmacology, the chapters were practically identical, with the new edition providing NO substantive new information. I cannot speak to the rest of this venerable reference, but this chapter was just a rehash (and a big disappointment)."
2,Get the 10th edition.,"I can't say that I'm pleased with the new edition. The information is grossly disorganized, there are no introductory chapters, and important information has been omitted or dumbed down, e.g. the section on fat-soluble vitamins, specifically vitamin A.If you're buying, get the 10th ed. The new edition is definitely a step down for Goodman & Gilman."
1,Women Pirates?!,"The author of this work has taken some of the most silly anecdotal stories about women in the military and claimed that they were real. Does he provide any archival sources to back it up? No. So then, why should we believe that these stories are true. The answer is that we shouldn't take the stories serious, nor should we take seriously the book they are found in."
4,Readable and comprehensive look at fighting women,"This book on warrior women reads easily- only its density- for I found that Dr. Jones had included so much- revealed his university ties. Just as there were once women priests, so too women could be fierce, feared warriors. This book should be required reading for men in the military- so they can respect the potential of their female cohorts."
4,An inspiring Read about Women from the Past,"Great book to read if you're ever feeling down, and think you can't do it, you're not strong enough, whatever.. You read some of these 'real' women's stories, and it makes you rethink what is truly possible, when faced with overwhelming odds.I've attempted to read several of the other 'Women Warrior' books, and found the author's writing styles...in a word, or two, boring and dull.This book I thoroughly enjoyed, even though I am not a history buff."
4,well researched and documented,"The secret to this book is its copious bibliography; more than enough information for one to go ahead and look up further information on anything mentioned that caught one's interest. And while it falls under the umbrella of a brief and wide ranging survey of the subject, many stories are just interesting enough to warrant further investigation.All in all a good read."
4,its ok,"u get what u pay for. it was cheap and it feels cheap, but it does the job. its worth the $20"
2,"Poor, poor, poor","I had one of these a couple years ago. It worked very well for a few months. Then, all of a sudden, the left analog stick became non-responsive. It wouldn't work on any game I tried. After reading other reviews on the gamepad, I figured I just got one that was poorly made and that the analog stick problem I had was just one of those several ones that was bad. Since it was only $20, I just left it alone. Well...after going months without a gamepad, I decided to get another Logitech gamepad, the same one I had, and guess what. After literally ONE DAY, the right analog stick stuck and is completely unresponsive. So, as far as I'm concerned...they're all terrible controllers. PERIOD."
1,Sweet pad while it works...,This seems like a perfect joystick until the calibration problems everyone else talks about happen.Shame on Logitech for continuing to sell a defective product like this.
4,good gamepad,"I'd rate this a 5 stars but it doesn't do anything exciting other than work very well. Bought it for Madden 07 for the PC and it works great, no complaints. I've read others say it feels cheap. That may be, at least compared with a true PS2 controller, but it's strong enough for me to squeeze with all the strength in my hands after a series of plays didn't go my way..."
4,Works for me,"I've had this controller for over a year now, and it still works great and reliably as ever. After many months, the analog sticks occasionally drifted a little, but a quick jiggle and they'd be back to center.The profiler software is excellent, allowing you to fully map the controller to your keyboard and even mouse. This allows you to play any game with the controller, even ones which don't naturally support gamepads like Splinter Cell. With the ""shift"" profile function, you can effectively double the number of buttons which I found great for playing a complicated flight sim like X-Wing Alliance, completely keyboard free, using only the gamepad.Only downside: The D-pad is hard to control precisely. It's difficult to press only Up, Down, Left or Right. You almost always end up pressing a diagonal direction instead. This made the D-pad more or less unusable for games like Street Fighter, but then the analog stick was a perfect alternative anyway."
1,Jerks left or right,"The 8 way D pad doesn't stay straight when moving forward. It jerks to the left or right and is way too touchy.How annyong to play a game and not have full control.The other parts of the controller seem OK. However, since the 8 way D pad is integral to this controller, the controller falls flat on its face. That's why it gets a 1 star. I'll have to return it and get another one.** sigh ** thanks for wasting my time Logitech."
1,Left analog stick loses calibration,"Do not buy this product. Like many other people who purchased this product, my left stick loses calibration, making the gamepad worthless."
2,What a piece of junk!,"This controller doesn't stay calibrated for longer than a few seconds before going kaput, and the digital controls don't work for anything requiring holding them or rapid action."
2,first ever Logitech product to fail me...,"Logitech products are known to be of prime quality and in a gamepad I was expecting something well made, responsive and accurate. Well, none of this are to be found on this gamepad. I believe and I think is a common notion nowadays that the best PC gamepad you can have as of today is the XBOX 360 PC compatible one. Don't look elsewhere."
1,POOR FOR MACBOOK PRO INTEL PROCESSOR,"NO SOFTWARE ON CD, DOESN'T EVEN GET RECOGNIZED!!! THIS IS THE SECOND CONTROLLER I HAVE PURCHASED THAT SAID MAC OS ON BOX AND DOESN'T WORK!!"
2,Doesn't work with CoD Modern Warfare,"I bought it for Modern Warfare and it's not even recognized! So, I guess it's off to try another. At least Amazon has an easy return policy. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 b/c it probably works with something."
1,It didn't even work,"It's very hard to give it a fair review when it doesn't even work. When I plug it into a usb port nothing happens, not even a ""device not recognized"" bubble message. I ended up breaking this thing apart in disgust, and buying a cheaper but more reliable Precision gamepad."
1,Right Anolog Lost Calibration,I had this controller for about a 3 weeks before the right analog stick went haywire. Try buying the ChillStream or even a 360 controller. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
2,Should have listened to others,"I read some negative reviews but still went for it as it was very cheap. Mine worked fine but the huge problem was key numbers were all wrong. Key no. 1 was key actually key 3,key 7 was key number 2 and all messed up like that. I was really looking forward to play some games in summer had to wait now till I get the other one:("
3,usb game controller,"I can not judge this as I bouth it for Crysis II and I can not use it. The game does not recognize it. So for now it is collecting dust. And yes I do have the latest drivers etc. Windows 7 16 gig ram. Athelon Phenom II X6 1090t etc etc etc. Yup, 60 bucks for a game that i really can not use comfortably"
2,Doesn't work after long term use!!,"Okay, I bought a Logitech Dual Action and it seemed to work well so I decided to buy another one so I could play video games with friends! Just a few months ago it became defective, it wouldn't even connect to my PC. So now i'm stuck with having to buy 2 more game pads. I would definitely not reccomend this product if you want it to last more than a year!"
1,Computer no longer recognizes the controller,"I've had the controller for about five months.. it worked alright on my old laptop. With my new one (2007 model Lenovo/IBM R series as opposed to 2008) it doesn't register as even existing when I plug it into a USB port, occasionally it will appear for a few seconds and then disappear again.. Everything else I plug into the USB ports work.The controller worked fine till a few weeks ago. I'm just peeved that there is money down the drain and more to shell out if I even want to play anything."
5,"cheap, effective and functional","Bought this for Legos Star Wars II for Mac. Mostly my 4 year old uses it, but I've played it a bit as well. I love mac, I just plug it in and there's no thinking or finding devices, it just works. Pad works fine in the game. The rotating joysticks have a little less control than the 4-way cross, but still easy to use. Lots of buttons to customize, friendly for the hands (my 4 year old has hands a little small to use it well, but he still likes it over the keyboard a lot better). Long cord.Not sure what the complaints are about. It's effective, works well, way better than the keyboard, it's been dropped numerous times on hard floors and still works fine. Good product."
2,Very painful to use for fighting games,"This is an OK general use controller, for emulation of old school games. It looks like a PS2 controller, but it is fatter. It is just fat enough that my left finger encounters a lot of stress from pressing against the rear section.The main issue I have with it is that the D-pad is also a button, and the extra pressure required makes playing fighting games a painful chore. I can play for about 30 minutes and require an hour-long break.Of course, few would have recommended this for fighting games, but it is all I have, and I am surprised at how incredibly painful it is to use.I played SF2 on the SNES back in the day for days straight, and never experienced anything like this."
2,Not an everlasting joypad...,"I bought this elsewhere as I was in need of a pad for my PC. I thought the PS2 controller look was pretty good, and the price was ok. Well, after a few months of Fifa 2004 and Grand Theft Auto III and Vice City, the left thumbstick grip on top wore down and then it started to lose its connection. The analog stick would have to be reconfigured every time I wanted to play something and even then it would become twitchy, so instead of say a player standing still they would take a step right or steering a speeding car in GTA and then suddenly lurching to the right, ARGH! CRASH!This pad should be about $10.00 in my honest opinion and even then watch how much you use it. Won't last more than a few month - A definite budget model."
2,Let The Sh-t Begin,"Let me begin by saying: this controller bites. However, it does not suck as bad as the other Wingman Logitech mess. I keep getting these crappy controllers as presents, so I'm going to spare countless others from getting them. DO NOT BUY THIS CONTROLLER. It has a bad feel to it, very breakable. Just because it looks like the Play Station controller, it does not respond as well. The D pad is very flimsy, in my opinion. I own this thing for one week already, and I expect it to be destroyed in a few more days. Now, I'm not a gaming guru, but I know thrash when I get it. In short, Logitech has a history for sucking. The end."
1,Totally Stinks,"This think is a piece of junk. Don't waste your money. I was very disappointed with the performance. I will never, ever buy another Logitech Product. You couldn't give me a Logitech Product as a paper weight! The FTC should shut them down for taking money for junk they call products!"
1,The same problem as everyone else.....,"This is a great, great controller. While it lasts. It was absolutely perfect for me. No-nonsense, let me play NHL perfectly. Then the calibration issues started, say, two weeks later. I can no longer move my hockey players to the right, which is vexing to say the least. I would not, unfortunately, recommend this buy. It seems lots of people wind up in this boat."
1,same problems as everyone else,"I've had the same problems as everyone else. For about a month, it was the best PC gamepad I've had. Then the left stick started drifting, and then started going in one direction only, and then stopped working. Try playing FIFA 2005 when your players only run and kick to their right. Plugging and unplugging seriously only corrects the problem for about a minute before the same old signs start popping up. Save your $20."
2,Great Quality... For a While,"I bought this controller a while ago when I bought Halo 2 for the PC. It worked great.After that game was over and done with it sat unused until I decided to buy Cabela's Dangerous Hunts for the PC. It worked great until a few weeks ago. The left analog stick began to ""stick"" in certain positions. Now, it just refuses to work.This is great for your occasional PC gamer, but if you intend to use it for long periods of time then I'd suggest buying something else."
2,wears out too easy,I have to agree with other reviewers that the D-pad and analog sticks seem to wear out too soon. I guess that's what you get for a $20 product...
1,Sticky Fingers,"There've been quite a few comments here about the quality (or lack thereof) of the d-pad and analog sticks, but I just watned to add that the buttons stick as well. I've had the gamepad for two weeks, and I'm already finding that my most used button is non-responsive. I bought this product because it was cheap but not generic. I may as well have just bought the piece of junk from a company I've never heard of that was half the price."
2,D-Pad issues,"The D-Pad on this controller is terrible. It feels mushy, but more importantly it impossible to consistenly hit any single direction. If you try to go right, you will often press up or down in addition, resulting in diagonal movement. This can be devastating, depending on the game. For example, it is impossible to reliably perform even simple fighting game moves such as SubZero's freeze or Ken/Ryu's fireball. Also, this pad lacks a button to swap the D-Pad with the left analog stick.The Saitek P880 is much better in this area. Also, Logitech fixed these issues when they made their Rumblepad 2, but it's a bit more expensive due to the rumble feature. If you think you ever might want to use the D-Pad, buy one of those other controllers instead of this one."
2,Hunk a' Junk,This game pad will work very well for two or three months until the left analog stick malfunctions. This is not a very durable piece of hardware.
1,Couldn't be paid to buy another one.,"I bought this gamepad a few months ago for my PC. While it worked great for maybe a month or two, its response time and control accuracy have greatly diminished recently. Attempts to reconfigure the gamepad have thus proved futile. Hopefully, someone will heed my warning and steer clear of this atrocious gamepad."
3,"Fine, But It Hurts","Pros:1. Very compatible to Windows2. Easy to setup3. Compatible to many games, including Monster Hunter Frontier Online and many console emulatorsCons:1. The analog sticks are hard on touch, prolonged use caused my thumbs to hurt and be injured, taking a few days to recover.2. The analog sticks don't have indent at the center, so it is harder to keep thumbs at neutral positions on them, and pressing analog buttons would easily trigger analog directive responses (meaning ↑↓←→&#8598;&#8600;&#8599;&#8601;)."
2,OK but...,"I really do not like the way the base of the analog sticks are shaped. As you can see they are SQUARED and not ROUNDED (like the Xbox or PS3 controllers. This becomes a slight problem if you have games where you need to rotate the sticks.Plus, it doesn't give you control when you need to move. The analog sticks just stay stuck in the corners."
4,Decent product,"So far, this is a good, cheap, game pad. It has a good feel for those of us who aren't particularly fond of the x-box styled controller. However, one thing that is a touch annoying is that the various buttons featured appear to be mis-labeled. This is a bit of an annoyance when you are trying to re-do your button layout for a certain game, as some of the buttons are quite far off from what they have been labled (and this has been in all games I've played using this pad so far). It isn't enough to really impede on gameplay, but it is a bit of an annoyance."
5,Escellent Customer Service,The first one I received had a dysfunctional left analog stick. They mailed me another one without even charging shipping and handling or asking for the first back!
3,Disappointing,"I was used to the XBOX controller, and bought this for my PC. My hands are on the small side, and it is uncomfortable for me to hold to hold. The buttons are positioned ackwardly enough to be a strain on my hands to operate for any extended period of time. Maybe for someone with bigger hands it would not be a problem. But for someone used to the xbox-controller, and liking it, I do not think this would be the right product for you."
1,Doesn't work on a Mac,The problem with this for the Mac OS Lion is that it does not work. Period. Logitech should have driver support of OSX!
5,Great Controller for Mac Computers,"Got this controller for my Mac, plugged it in, and BAM! it works--really well... perfect in fact. Like it should. If you have a Mac, this controller is a great choice--bet it works on a PC ok too."
2,Don't buy this controller,"It didn't take two weeks for this controller to lose control of the left analog pad, actually, it was more like 2 days.I bought this gamepad because it said that it was compatible with FIFA 2004 -- well, when it is working, it is just great, but many times, it loses control DURING a match.I'm going to buy a different company's controller this week."
1,This product REALLY doesn't work...,I read the other reviews and thought they must have been unlucky. So I went out to buy the Logitech Dual Action and it was a great gamepad for about 3 weeks until the left stick started acting weird. I'm playing a lot of Madden NFL 2004 and after every snap my QB moves now to the left even without touching the pad. It sucks and makes this product useless. I deserve it though because I didn't listen to the other reviewers. My advice: DON'T BUY IT!
1,Don't bother...,"I just bought it, and I'm taking it back. It worked for about 15 seconds and hasn't worked since...cheap junk."
1,Not for mac,"I bought this to game on my mac. It says it is compatible with mac however the little disc they send with it cannot be inserted into the mac. And I could not find, after days of searching, any downloadable version of the software online. It says it works with mac but you need the software in order to use it and there are no options for mac users to get the software."
2,Everything is well until the left analog starts to act weird,"Just like what everybody is saying, but it doesn't seem that severe to me though. Played NFS: Underground and Prince of Persia with it, when you constantly move the analog button, you won't feel any difference. It is only when you let go off the button and suddenly your guy started to walk by itself! Pity pity, it could be the perfect gamepad out there that resembles PlayStation gamepad..."
1,Bad product - Lost all respect for Logitech,"I bought 2 and both have the same major problem. Both have the analog stick calibration drift problem, which is widespread and well-documented online (check out the logitech web site user forums). Unfortunately, Logitech is totally ignoring the problem despite a tremendous amount of complaints (presumably because it is a unpatchable hardware problem). I am also upset with EA for endorsing it for MVP Baseball 2004. I replaced it with the comparable Saitek P880, which has worked well for me so far."
1,Another Broken Unit,"I bought this item before reading these reviews but wish I had read them first. The controller is terrific except for the ""minor"" detail that the left stick went out after a couple of weeks. First I noticed a slight drift and now it completely freezes during game play on a regular basis. Sure you can fix it; exit the game, unplug and replug the device, and restart the computer. However, as I don't consider this a benefit I'll be returning today and finding another product."
1,teh foock,"Ok heres the lowdown, I don't know what came over the designers of these new game pads, but I havent purchased a recently made controller yet with a high quality d-pad. Which brings me to this controller, which suffers from the same issue as the rest. If you are buying this controller to play any game on your computer that require you to use your d-pad forget about it. The action is delayed and finicky. The d-pad sticks and cuts down on the percision in your gameplay. Bottom line, it sucks Im returning it. Im going to search for a controller made a couple years ago when, for some reason, computer controller makers knew how to make d-pads. If I could give this controller 0 stars I would."
1,BAD GAMEPADS,Steer clear of these gamepads. Actually you won't be able to steer anything because most likely in a matter of weeks they won't work. I bought two at the same time and had sporadic problems right from the start and now they just quit working completely. I've seen many people having exactly the same problems on discussion boards. Spend a little more money and stay away these controllers.
3,"Good, but be carefull","This controler is fine, and easy to use, but mine only lasted a few months, the analogue stick went crazy. It did take quite a beating from my 4 year old naphew, but I have and older Belking Nostromo that has taken the same rough treatment for several months more, and that one still works fine. Oh, and the D-pad is not very precise.If you still want one of these because it is simple and well designed, take really good care of it."
1,Mine broke as well,"In the same manner as some of the other posts. The left analog joystick gets stuck, or just stops working in some directions. I have to unplug and plug it in again to make it work. Time to shop for something better. I'd avoid this joypad."
1,Great gamepad - Horrible Durability,"This gamepad is great - if it worked.Just like ALL OF THE OTHER REVIEWERS have described, my Left Analog stick is no longer functioning properly. It will not respond when moving it to the right. I have only had the controller for about 2+ weeks, and I am far from a heavy gamepad user.These controllers should obviously be recalled.UPDATE: I have been able to recalibrate the controller by unplugging it from the USB connector on my PC. I have to do this daily. NOT GOOD.UPDATE2: I bought a new controller (and returned the old one), and so far after about 4 weeks, no more calibration problems. Maybe they got the problem fixed? If the calibration problem stays away, I would give this 4+ stars."
1,Stay away from this!,"Don't buy it. If people will stop buying this gamepad then Logitech will start taking customers' feedback seriously.This gamepad is a waste of money. The Internet is full of complains about this pad, all with same problems. We are not fools, we have been robbed, period. Yes, there maybe be 2 people that were happy with it, but there are thousands that only wasted their money. If you want to take the chance and try to be one of those 2-3 lucky people, then buy it. My suggestion is to not buy anything else from Logitech anymore. Not only they robbed me, they didn't even pay attention to my complains.Not 2, but a THOUSAND of thumbs down!!"
1,Analog stick gave out after two hours.,"This gamepad was fine when I was just using the D-pad for emulated SNES games. But about two hours into playing Batman: Arkham Aslyum, the left analog joystick has fallen out of calibration. Logitech does not provide a Macintosh calibration utility (despite the OS X logo on the package), and nothing, not even rebooting, fixes the problem. This junker is going in the trash."
3,i was what i expected,It was what i expected. although it does not work on my tombraider 3 game. other than that i works.
5,Great Hardware,"I don't know why everyone has had troubles with this controller, but I surely haven't. In fact I'd say it's probably one of the best controllers, console or otherwise, I have ever used. The D-pad and analog sticks feel wonderful. I plugged it in and started playing! Great, cheap, easy, and works like a charm."
3,Good use but not that sensitive,"The controller is comfortable to hold and looks nice. Compared with my last controller, the button are not that sensitive."
5,Excelente Producto,"Producto excelente y la empresa que lo vende es muy responsable, cumple con todo lo prometido y el plazo de entrega se cumplio justo como lo indicaron. Los recomiendo ampliamente"
2,"too simple, too unwieldy","The author seems to underestimate toddlers` intelligence and attention spans. While the text of the `stories` includes some thoughtful questions to ask the child, many of the stories are oversimplified, and less interesting than if told in more detail. Although the colorful illustrations will engage any youngster, I am also concerned that all the people are depicted with creamy, peach-toned skin. With so many stories packed into a small space, the book is thick and heavy, like a small dictionary, which makes it difficult to hold open with one hand, a manoeuver which, especially if you have one or more children who move, is an absolute necessity. I highly recommend THE LION STORYTELLER`S BIBLE, which is written to be told. There are fewer stories, but the writing is better (attention paid to rhythm and repetition, for example.) The author does not talk down to little ones, and the stories (fifty-plus) are neither too long nor too short."
2,Simple Book about a Complex Cat,"Review of Abyssinian Cats by Stuart A. KallenThis thin, hard cover, childrenfs book is easy to read with medium-sized fonts and captioned color pictures. Good for kids learning to read, for grown-ups to read to their kids, or for families with young children that are thinking of buying a cat and want to educate their children. The book introduces where cats come from, what an Abyssinian catfs character and conformation is, and then general information on care, feeding, kittens and purchasing options. The content is not too serious or technical, with easy words and concepts. A glossary is included for the few not-so-common words. An index and bibliography add to the thoroughness of the book. This book is a good model for youngsters learning how to write a book or paper, is good for learning to read, and has only some general information on Abys."
5,A Look Back,"This is a courageous book written by a courageous woman. The story is of a life that continues to endure despite many hardships. If Betty Friedan had been less bright, one wonders if her life would have been easier. My personal favorite part in the book is that of her childhood. One can see her development as a feminist. When one is involved in raising daughters, I feel there is alot to learn in this book. As an aunt with four young nieces, I see the great responsibility one has in raising women to become leaders in the world today. That is why I recommend this book for library use."
2,boring,"I was honestly expecting something more insightful, especially after reading her first more famous book. This book was one I didn't even finish because it just was not engaging. Perhaps others might disagree, but my opinion is to pass on this one."
2,"Disappointing, unless you are an exhibit designer","If you want a history of America's transporation ""from horse to horse power"" look elsewhere. America on the Move is about staging a Smithsonian exhibition on American transportation. The details of the exhibition are recounted in exhaustive detail: How a bus was resized to fit the exhibit hall, where a historic car was found, how to display a locomotive. What suffers is the actual history, which is included in brief dibs, dabs and snippets between interviews with curators and designers. We had hoped this would be an informative show on the history of American transportation and it's role in the growth and expansion of the United States. My daughter, a teacher, needs such material for a unit in her social studies class. This DVD has too little for such use, even as short clips. We found the recounting of the mounting of the exhibition very tedious."
2,great movie,I love this movie!!!I bought the movie and have watched it several times. You should see it!Love the scenery. Great Christmas romantic comedy movie Great additiond to my Christmas movies collecetion
1,Horrid movie. The main actress is HORRIBLE!,"ugh. couldn't take it. just terrible. plus, the main character(as seen on the HBO show Entourage) is so terribly miscast. She is an atrocious actress, too short and stubby to be cute or interesting, and her english is not mature enough to be believable as a ""business-woman."" Not to mention the fact that she wears skin-tight ripped jeans in most of the movie. I LOVE Christmas movies, but this one is a REAL STINKER!don't waste your time. Lifetime and Hallmark both have some great Christmas movies, this one does not make my repeat-viewing list....I urge Hollywood, do not hire that actress again, MAYBE as a some sort of carnival-dwarf or an extra at a fat-camp.oh, there is a scene with really strange singing in the warehouse and they are dancing around with their carts, for 'camp-value,' it is worth buying the dvd and posting it on the internet! It's such an absurd scene!!! It makes you feel really uncomfortable and embarrassed for all those in it!!!"
4,It's not that bad...,"Maybe I have bad taste or something, but I actually enjoyed this movie (albeit, only as a guilty pleasure), and was surprised to see all the one-star reviews. This is your typical made-for-tv / lifetime-original-movie fare, and if you go into it knowing what to expect, it's an enjoyable ride. Sure, it's corny, patronizing, and full of hammy acting from no-name actors, but it's a sweet and simple movie that captures the spirit of the season pretty well...and that's what I expect from this type of feature. After watching Lifetime Network's Christmas specials for the past few weeks, this one actually stands out as one of the better efforts."
2,great christmas movie?,"A great christmas movie? Not so much. But hey, if you collect christmas movies, you gotta have em all. Happy holidays..."
2,"Well, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen.","All She Wants for Christmas is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it could be a close second. Seemingly amateur acting does not overcome a weak but cheerful script. In essence, it is an only marginally entertaining Christmas film. There are no surprises for a film of this genre. There are much better out there worth your time and money."
1,"Oh, this movie is bad!","I am angry at myself for wasting an hour and half of the holiday season and spending the money on this terrible film. Bad acting, bad plot. The only redeeming aspect of the film was the handsome lead actor, but that did not make up for all the other negatives of this film. And I am someone who LOVES Christmas movies......."
4,Excellent Christmas Movie,I really enjoyed this movie. I watch many Christmas films and most have the same concept but this one takes a different approach. It is very enjoyable.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This book was not helpful at all. It is only 15 pages and it only gives two examples, neither of which are very applicable to real world designs. There are more examples for free all over the internet."
3,Keep your facts straight,"This book provides a satisfactory conclusion to the World Gates series. The every-day reality is enough like our own that we can believe there really are gates between worlds up, down, forward, backward, and sideways. The heroine is just a bit too perfect. Some annoying inconsistencies from the 1st 2 books have crept in, and the author has not fully thought out the immortality concept that is largely limited to this book. She could have done better."
5,The BEST LCD Screen Cleaner,"I've tried many others out there and this one truly is the BEST. It gets all greasy finger prints and smudges out and leaves the LCD crystal clear and helps keep it static free so there's no dust and fuzzies on it. I use it on my laptop, HD tv too and it works great on cleaning the outside of the laptop as well as my cell phone and ipod."
2,Is this water only?,"My guess in that this product is nearly all water if not exclusively water. I have not seen any effect of this that was any different than plain water. The enclosed cloth will take off finger prints dry: it is very good. I tried cleaning something else with iKlear, and no effect. If you want a spray bottle with something liquid in it that will remove dust and dirt, spay a microfibre cloth with water. There is nothing on this bottle that indicates its contents, such as a poison warning or treatment method for accidental ingestion. If it has so little chemical, or indeed any chemical, as to not require a warning... guess what? A-ch-two-oh!"
2,Unnecessary,"This product cleans well, but that is simply it. It does not remove scratches. You can simply do the same with another cheap cleaner. It's a waste of money."
