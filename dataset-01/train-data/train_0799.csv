3,Like Streisand for the 90's.,"It is a good CD but aside from Shadowboxer and Criminal it is bluesy easy listening. Psuedo blues, but her voice is so wonderful it is enjoyable."
4,Impressive Debut,"While many of the patterns on this album are all too familiar, Fiona's combination of thoughtful lyrics and a melancholy voice are entrancing. Highlights of the album include ""Never is A Promise"", ""Sleep to Dream"", and ""Criminal"" (it's better if you never even see the video). There's no denying her talent, but she can't be compared to Joni Mitchell, Emily Saliers, or Tori Amos. In time, perhaps, her music will just get better -- hopefully to the point where one can ignore her considerable and over-hyped sex appeal."
4,"Edgy, Angry, and Blue","The girl has a *great* voice, the best lyrics around, and some out-and-out fabulous songs. She is edgy and Blue-sy and can rock as well. Many of her songs are in the Blues tradition and she sings them skillfully and soulfully. My favories, however, are the angry ones that she belts out with everything she's got."
5,Oh....My.....God,"Fiona Apple is, without a doubt, the best solo singer I have ever heard. I admit, I didn't like her at first, but that was in 1997 when I was a naive third grader who only cared about the Spice Girls. I wasn't in touch with real music back then, but believe me, I am now.I actually bought her second CD first. I really loved the song ""Criminal"" and I wanted Tidal so bad, but when I went to the store it was out of my price range, so I bought When The Pawn... instead. That's what really introduced me to Fiona Apple. Every song on that album was perfect. Then someone I know burned Tidal for me, and I wasn't disappointed.Fiona Apple pours her heart and soul into her songwriting. It's honest, and beautiful. And most of all, it's powerful. She is, and always will be, one of the best singers on this planet. If you buy this album, you will not regret it. It's absolutely amazing.Favorite tracks:""Sleep to Dream""""Sullen Girl""""Criminal""""Shadowboxer""""Carrion"""
2,Tidal,"Overall a boring album. Fiona Apple writes good lyrics and okay music. Musically it is not very compelling and she tries to be a bit jazzy, bit rockish and poppish and even though she manages to be that all she doesn't do it very well. Her voice is irritating and constant moaning doesn't help either. Her Piano playing is overlooked by the mass production which often distract the listners from the music. Obviously talented but this album isn't very good in my opinion."
5,Tidal is Terrific,"Fiona Apple is one of the best female artiss of the 90s. Her album has deep lyrics , smokey balads and amazing vocals.She is an awesome singer ,talented pianist and a gifted songwriterSleep to Dream 5/5 This song has deep lyrics that talks about a relationship that was taken for grantedSullen Girl 3/5 It is a sad and powerful song about a depressed girlShadowboxer 4/5 a smokey balad about a brake upCriminal 5/5 Great song . Fiona's biggest hit everSlow like Hoey 4/5 Song about someone wanting you back but you dont want them backThe First Taste 3/5 Song about someone wanting someone backNever is a Promise 5/5 This is a song about never promising someone backThe Child Is Gone 4/5 soft balad with miseryPale September 4/5 Beautifal Song and beautiful lyricsCarrion 4/5 light songTHIS ALBUM IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Solid Performance,"Although Fiona Apple's Tidal is not a new release, it is a solid record. It has a little something for everyone. Even my mom (almost 80 yrs old) likes portions of it. My impression whenever I listen to Fiona's music is that it is fresh, (even after 5 years of listening to it) very well produced and the arrangements still team me up! This keyboard oriented music and deep lyrics make this a great CD for your collection."
5,A genuine artist,"Can't wait for her next CD. I bought Fiona's TIDAL because I liked the cover and the 3 listening samples; never heard of her, or any of her work. I've had the CD for about 3 months and she is the vehicle that led me to a number of new (to my ears), very talented female songwriting-singer-musicians. Fiona is definitely one that searches her soul and finds questions AND answers. She and Natalie Umbruglia are the best."
5,An emotional roller-coaster!,"Fiona Apple's CD has been with me through thick and thin. I can relate to every single song on the entire CD. She's totally original and that's what made me buy her CD. The music on there is so powerful, that you have to sit back and let it flow through you to get the full effect of her work. I can't wait for her next CD!"
2,'Criminal' highlight of mediocre album,"This debut from aspiring Lilith Fair singer Fiona Apple (her real name?) is a real disappointment. Aside from the decent Criminal, which I grew to love on the radio, I rushed out to buy Tidal. After listening to Criminal, I started to listen to the rest. Dark, slow, very jazzy, and, overall, not very catchy. Ho-hum."
4,Good condition-delayed arrival.,Item took over 2 weeks to arrive but made itintact. Seller very responsive and willing toassist.
5,Shes the next BIG THING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Fiona apple is a very cool mystique presence.her voice is like a dark angel humming.She is depressed and boy does she have reasoning too.Her rape, numerous therapist visit plus her evry day normal angst!This cd is a platinum masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!"
5,amazing debut,"i can remember first falling in love with this cd. it was about 4 months after the album came out she was on the cover of the daily news in los angeles and she was doing a show that night '96. i read the review of her album and just went out and bought it, wow just an amazing album i couldn't get over it for months. and years later i still go back and play this cd and just hearing her voice, heartache, longing for love, obsession it's just wonderful music on that album. i gotta say that never is a promise is my favorite from tidal."
4,Tidal,"I bought this disc back in 1996 after hearing a lot of buzz & hype about Fiona Apple. After my first listen and now 10 years later, I still had the same reaction, ""Wow - she's only 18 writing songs like this!?"" Even today it is so refreshing to hear such poetically beautiful lyrics set to original composition. Her smoky voice is haunting and while she is not the best vocalist I've ever heard; like another great singer/songwriter, Laura Nyro, Fiona sings HER songs with such passion & conviction that eclipses the fact that she's not a vocal powerhouse. I also love the fact that she so successfully mixed different genres of music to create own sound.My favorite tracks: THE FIRST TASTE, SLOW LIKE HONEY, CRIMINAL, PALE SEPTEMBER & NEVER IS A PROMISE."
5,"like water,it inspires!","i don't know what is better.her writing skills or her acrobatic vocal style.her voice is deep beyond her years,yet smooth like silk,she is not only a great singer but a great poet as well(all the songs on tidal are written by fiona).she's moody,profound,thought provoking,she is a breathing contradiction.tidal is confusing poetry thought in the head said out loud,the world needs more people like fiona."
1,MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT,"So, I first heard Ms. Apple performing ""Slow Like Honey"" on a radio program called 'Acoustic Cafe' late in 1996. I was intrigued--had never heard of her before--so I wrote the name down and kept an eye out for a CD.Months later, I found ""Tidal"" at my local record store. A bit concerned about buying a CD on the strength of one live song, I hesitantly made my purchase. BIG MISTAKE......This is, without a doubt, the WORST CD purchase I have made in years!Some of the more off-key crooning makes my stomach churn in agony. (""Shadow Boxer"" should come with the same warnings that are printed on bottles of Syrup of Ipecac.)Hopefully, now that she's a mega-star, dear Fiona will invest in singing lessons.Needless to say, I sold this disc to back to the shop immediately. I'm just glad to have gotten six bucks back.Save YOUR money......buy a Sarah Vaughn disc if you want some genuine emotive soul crooning."
1,Extremely disappointing,"I received this album as a gift over a year ago. The only listenable songs were ""Shadowboxer"" and ""Criminal,"" and even those weren't so great. I already had ""Criminal"" on the 1998 Grammy Nominees album, so why did I need to have it on two albums? It just wasn't worth my time. I only had this album for a week and a half before I sold it to a used CD store."
2,Not impressed,I thought the music was murky. Perhaps not my style. Tried to trade it in but it ws politely shunted aside by the guy buying discs. That told me alot. She must have a loyal following it did nothing for me.
2,the pawn hasn't hit yet,"I have a lot of respect for Ms. Fiona. However.. I was very disappointed over Tidal after hearing the magnificient When the Pawn. It is clear how much Fiona has evolved between those two albums, because on Tidal she can barely form a tangible melody--her voice tends to jump.The only song that is fully enjoyable is Criminal, with it's light-hearted jazz-rock beat and Fiona's voice gliding across the melody. She performs it very well. On the other hand, ""Sleep to Dream,"" the opener of the album, sounds like an experimental hip-hop track. ""Never is a Promise"" is earnest but too self-righteous to touch listener's minds. ""Carrion,"" the closer, is really jazzy but does not hit an emotional note.If you want to enjoy Fiona Apple at her best, I reccommend When the Pawn Instead."
3,it was alright,"good effort on here with the piano in several tracks and fiona's promising voice, but I personally thought she was overrated and there are much better musicians and artists out there who deserve the hype she got from mtv"
5,very mature for her age just an all around good CD,"Her voice is very mature and the music has an element of jazz It is a slower CD, her voice is calming and the lyrics are great. You can tell she has passion in what she talks about without her screaming or whining about things. She seems like she has been hurt in life and love. All the songs are great!! You can feel the music. It's just to bad she only had one real hit. She deserves more."
5,I've loved this CD for years,I love everything about this CD. Fiona's voice is sultry and delicious and the lyrics are beautiful. I've had this CD for years and it remains a consistent choice in my CD player.
2,Fiona has two good apples here.,"""Sleep To Dream"" and ""Criminal"" are musically superb. The remainder of the album is filler."
2,Used Dental Floss,"I wasn't super pleased with this, considering the reviews behind it. THis album is kinda boring, not very inventive. Spend the money on the Rushmore Soundtrack."
1,wish i could give it no stars,"fiona apple is another example of the music industries 'manufactured' product(s). fiona apple is a fake, she tries to be different, tries to talk and sound deep, but makes a fool out of herself trying. her music is no other than a 'wannabe' underground artist, that tries to act like she's indie or something (whatever she's trying to do). i cant beleive i bought this album, it really disappointed me. i've got five words for fiona : 'you are trying too hard'."
1,uggh,Fiona can't sing worth a damn ... she's not in tune half the time an her lyrics are AWFUL (not the words but the way they are set to music) - most of the time she's adding syllables to words because she couldn't make the lyrics match the tune. This is really awful music. I can't believe anyone actually LIKES this stuff!
1,"Not too impressive, even for an 18 year old.","Although I won't say that she's trying to be Tori Amos, no one could acheive that, she definetely is not doing anything so impressive. Her lyrics sound even more self-obsessed than Tori's. It's like she's trying to be philosophical, but it's not quite working. I feel the same anger and guilt she does, but I want a singer who demands and includes me at the same time, whereas Fiona Apple just seems to be venting her anger towards me. I want you to understand my pain and make me feel better, not to feel guilty for your pain! If she got some singing lessons, actually played the piano (does she just say she plays the piano, 'cause I've never seen her do so), and didn't try to solve her problems with rage but with understanding, she would be a much better artist. I respect her though for trying. Good luck Fiona in discovering you might actually have more talent than you show."
1,Fiona Made A Fool Out Of Herself,"Fiona sounds ridiculously stupid singing these songs in her low, monotone, dragging voice. Her vocals are awful. She can't sing- she has no range. I can't remember a single word- just uuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhh, bluuuuuuuuuuuhhhh, duuuuuuuuuuh, blaaaaaaaaaaaaaah, uuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh!"
4,Fiona Apple is GREAT!,"I LOVE this CD. At first when I heard Criminal, I thought it was Sheryl Crow, but when I saw Fiona singing it, I realized it was her and not Sheryl. I just wanted to say that this is a GREAT CD, my favorite songs on here is Sleep to Dream(which I like the most), Shadowboxer, & Criminal. She has such a strong voice when she sings these songs and she has a good talent. Also, the lyrics are so strong too. Keep up the good work, Fiona!"
3,Good album; some songs are better than others.,"Apple's debut album is unique and fun to listen to. Her lyrics are nearly poetic and very meaningful. The highlights of the album are ""Sleep To Dream"", ""Criminal"", and ""Shadowboxer."""
4,Great value 3CD set containing hard to find tracks.,"This 3 CD set features 54 tracks mainly from the 1960's and 70's. It contains several tracks not available on any other Bassey CD including The Way We Were, What I Did For Love, Born To Lose, Emotion, My Way, I'll Be Your Audience, All In Love Is Fair and Feelings. Only disappointment is the fact that the tracks were not remastered for CD and some tracks contain some background hiss."
4,A Great Bassey Collection!,"Some of her best work, not easily found elsewhere. The gem is 'Born to Lose' which I heard her do live some years back. A definite plus for any Bassey fan. Only reason I didn't rate a '5' is that some of the tracks need a remastering due to some minor tape hiss."
5,What a Deal,Four Decades of Song is a 3 CD Box set that is price so low that it seems like a steal. I thought for that price how could I go wrong and I was right the quality of the CD is great and the songs WOW! Shirley sure can belt them out. One of the nice things about this CD box set besides the outstanding value is the selection of songs it has many songs which I have been unable to find on CD before. I have been listening to these CD at work everyday for the last 5 months and still love hearing it. You can never go wrong if you like Bassey and this Box set proves it once again. Get it and I think you will love it also.
5,Sounds good to me,"I really was just looking for one song- What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life, but for the price, I got 3 discs. I am enjoying all 3 and have not really noticed any poor sound quality."
2,Shirley Bassey Diva,This is one of the biggest disappointments in recent memory of Bassey.I think perhaps it was recorded years ago. The orchestration nor her voice is at their best. After the death of her daughter and she lost her voice and was retained by some famous teacher. She became the reigning queen of high drama in the female performer. When she's at her best there is no equal !!!
2,Crush washers are too fragile,"This product ships with no installation instructions. You'll probably tighten the banjo bolt down until the whole piece is somewhat stable. That's where you will go wrong. Gas spews all over the place and those delicate little plastic washers are warped and wont seal anymore. Too bad they dont throw in another pair. So you postpone your project until Ace Hardware opens so you can buy some copper crush washers and try to salvage the 15 bucks you're already in the hole; and just to ensure you make progress on you spend some extra cash on a 5/8-20 hose barb connection in case you have to scrap everything and go back to the basics. It's a shame, because the metal part is actually built better than I expected. I was really afraid it was chromed plastic. Count on this piece costing you another 9 bucks plus time and frustration and budget accordingly."
2,Ultimate Demonstration Disc Review,"I purchased a new Sony Receiver and a surround sound speaker system and connected it to my Sony flat screen tv in December 2008. I was looking for a demonstration CD or DVD to play through my new Home Theater Surround Sound System to evaluate the performance of the receiver, speakers and cables. I probably would not have purchased this particular CD if I could have listened to it before purchasing. A very small part of the CD was ok, but I was disappointed with the most of it. I feel it did not demonstrate my surround sound speakers effectiveness well enough. I would like to be able to review the material on the CD before buying again."
3,It's not her best...,This book is the weakest link in the Celi saga. It does not compare with any of the books in the Rune Blade series. I can only hope that book 2 of this series is based on characters with greater depth. The characters in this book are rather predictable and two dimensional. The story line is also predictable and frustrating.
1,Absolutely horrible,"I picked up this book for a light read one afternoon and it was most disappointing. The characters are one dimensional, the plot is very predictable, and the dialogue is very unnatural."
4,Good,"Como filme remasterizado o trabalho está louvável. É uma pena que o distribuidor no tenha noo que a obra possa interessar a admiradores de outros países como o Brasil por exemplo e no disponha, pelo, menos legenda em portugus-Br. Sou obrigado a re-autorar introduzindo legendas PT-Br.How remastered film work is commendable. It's a shame that the distributor has no notion that the work may be of interest to fans of other countries such as Brazil and does not, by less, Portuguese -Br subtitles. I am forced to re-author introducing subtitlesPT-Br."
4,A very FANTASTIC book!,"This book tells everything about Colin McRae; from when he was just a little tiny baby, to what he is right now. I suggest this very much to fans of Colin (If they don't know too much about him). I think this is the best book that explains about Colin because it was written by Colin himself. But this is one thing I'd like to say: Better not buy it if you're not a Colin McRae fan!"
4,Radical Amazement,In my recent Amazon purchase I was delighted to find an author able to integrate the scientific and the spiritual without over or understating the findings of either. It is well organized and clearly written. It is a worthwhile read for anyone interested in the dialogue between the spiritual and the scientific communities
5,Amazing!,"This book is really amazing! The connection between science, scripture, and living the Christian life is brilliant! A must read for all on the spiritual journey!"
5,Radically Amazing,"Radical Amazement is one of my favorite books! I have shared this book with all my friends! I bought an extra supply to pass out to my friends. I even gave one to my neighbor down the street, a Baptist Pastor! Hope to use this in an interfaith, inter-parish group and start a book club!I'm looking forward to making Judy's retreat in July! Blessings to all! Sister Rose Therese"
5,Black heroine from the 1700s,"This is a wonderful book. It was in the library when I was a young girl and I read Sophia Scrooby's adventure several times. I was really thrilled to find it in the New Orleans Public Library Children's Room when I began work there. This book should be in print and in libraries everywhere. It is thrilling and well-researched. The character is taken from African, enslaved, educated, freed, and made into a heroine. And she is highly believable."
3,somewhat disappointed,"I'm sorry to say that I am quite disappointed with this scale. It's my first Soehnle scale and I thought I would absolutely love it. The LED display is great ... very easy to read. The scale is very attractive. However, sometimes when the scale is moved just a bit it loosens the battery and the scale stops working, so I have to pick it up, turn it over, and open the battery housing. Also, when you step on it three times in a row it will change the read-out by anywhere from .1 to .3 pounds ... not such a big deal, but I wouldn't have expected this from a Soehnle product. I've thought about returning it to Amazon but haven't done so yet since these problems are not major. Still, I don't think I'd recommend this Soehnle model. I'd be interested to know if others have had similar problems and if there are any remedies, especially about the battery coming loose."
2,Erratic Readings,"The scale looks great! But if you are looking for consistent readings, look elsewhere. It will read within a couple of pound of your weight, but for most people such accuracy is inadequate. Their spec is .2 pounds. Their quality control was sleeping at the wheels when they shipped my unit out. Also, I would not recommend you weigh anything less than 20 pounds. The inconsistency goes off the scale!The position of the feet on the scale appears to make a difference in reading. The scale was supposedly designed to correct for such imbalance, but I sure did not notice it.All their printed material comes in every language in the world except ENGLISH! I guess they assumed that all English readers intuitively know how to use the scale.One of the reasons I purchased this scale was to weigh my luggage for airline checkin. Positioning the bags on the scale is cumbersome and again the reading was unreliable. After you pay your $75.00 penalty you will understand my review very well!"
3,Not bad,I bought this product to help keep track of my success in losing weight. The product is nice looking & not bulky. It turns on & off fine for me. The only concern I have - (since I like to do this) is when I weigh myself then i step off and try it again.... sometimes it fluctuates the weight within 3 lbs different. That aint gonna help me if I'm trying to see if I lost weight in the last week! I wish it was more accurate -- but I know it's pretty close each time.
2,To Weigh Or Not To Weigh Daily,"This product seems accurate uses two lithium 3v button batteries. After using it for about two years the unit kept indicating low battery power, checked it with a voltage meter more than once and the batteries check as good yet the unit periodically goes into this warning mode. After the batteries are removed the unit resets itself and operates normally for awhile then reverts to the low battery power warning. I would assume the scale has some software issues and falsely defaults to the an erroneous battery warning."
2,Electronic Scale,"Scale appears to be somewhat accurate but has recently given false messages about a low battery condition. Although a volt meter tested the lithium cells batteries to be fine, you may need to remove and reinsert batteries to stop this false reading by the scale several times. This leads me to believe the electronics on this precision instrument may not be up to par when it comes to weight measurement."
2,Inconsistent readouts,"I've owned this scale for 2 years. It is stylish, the digital display is easy to read. It continues to work, in the sense that it continues to display something when you step on it. However the problem is that the measurements are inconsistent. They can vary by 6 to 8 pounds in successful measurements.This morning I stepped on it and got the exact same reading 4 times in a row. Then I stepped on it a fifth time and it read 4 pounds heavier. It then held that reading two more times. On the 8th time, it went back to the first measurement.A couple of days ago I stepped on it 6 times and got 4 different measurements, with a difference of 7 pounds between the lightest and heaviest.So it only gives me a rough idea of what I weigh. If that is all you seek, then it does a good job. But if you are trying to determine if you are gaining or losing weight from day to day, from week to week, it is almost worthless."
1,Didn't last a year,This scale has died after less than a year of use.I figured that a scale manufactured by such a reputable company would be reliable. I am very disappointed.
3,International Dictionary of Adult and Continuing Education,"Because this is an international dictionary written by a British professor the preponderance of terms are not applicable to students of adult education in the United States. At the same time, the book lacks many terms that are applicable to US students of adult education. I recommend either in its place or as a companion book a handy and inexpensive dictionary written by Bernadine Raiskums, M.Ed. for US students of adult education: Principles and Principals: A Dictionary of Contemporary Adult Education Terms and Their Users available through PWR & Associates."
4,Good b side and live song by great band,Like in the other single this is the same 1st track the Still Laughing live song is a live studio song( if you dont get this think of the Its Been A While extra track at the end of Break The Cycle) but still great. Next was Miles Away From Nowhere awesome track dont know why it wasnt included on the album. Again this is a MUST for any Lost Prophets fan
2,Very basic info,This DVD was kind of a let down as it was extremely basic. There are a variety of weatherization books out that go into much greater detail and describe much better ways to weatherize your home.
3,Useful Introduction,A reasonable quick introduction to free trade from someone who is obviously much in favour of it. Doesn't go deeply into things and is heavily based on fairly recent US-orientated examples. It appears to be reasonably well researched and the author backs up his points well but the book does not really grip or inspire you.
4,"Good tunes, short release","If you liked Arcade's self-titled debut release, you'll enjoy this.The concert tracks are broken apart by the demo tracks. Tracks 1, 2, 6, 8, 11 and 12 are live 1993. The remaining tracks are demo's from 1992. This would have been distracting. But the concert tracks are played very close to the studio original. No extended guitar solos or interaction with the audience to remind you the song is live.This would have a 5 star release if they had only included a full concert with the demos at the end. At only 52 minutes, there's plenty of room for more material."
2,pearcy live,"Previous reviewer wrote ""No extended guitar solos or interaction with the audience to remind you the song is live"" and ""disk is short"" Have you ever seen Pearcy live? No interaction with the audience, no solos, and only 13 songs. This is Pearcy live! He don't move, he don't talk, and usually cuts 3 or 4 songs off the end of the show. Pearcy is a corpse on stage, gawd everyone knows that. I think I saw hip hop once, but that's his live show. Mr. Vegas excitement he ain't."
1,IT COULD BE BETTER,"WELL, SADLY THE LIFE PERIOD OF THIS GREAT ROCK GROUP WAS VERY SHORT BUT WITH ONLY 2 ALBUMS SHOWED A LOT OF GREAT MUSIC SKILLS. THIS ALBUM DOESN'T SHOW THE BEST OF THEM-VERY DISAPOINTING HIS CD, I THINK A BETTER PRODCUT FOR FANS AND TO SELL FOR THE RECORD COMPANY COULD BE: TAKE ON ONE CD (80 MINUTES IS GOOD ROOM)THE BEST STUDIO SONGS FROM THE 2 ALBUMS (ARCADE AND A/2) AND ADD THE SONG ""POLAROID"" OUTTAKE OF A/2, AND DO A REMASTER, PLEASE, NO LIVE NO NOISY DEMOS...HOPING ARCADE REUNITE FOR A NEW CHANGE, THEY ARE GREAT!"
1,Great Machine but just keeps crashing,"Microsoft has created an extraordinary machine. Crisp graphics and so far the library of games available are impressive. The only problem I have is that Microsoft produced a defective product. For the first few months it played fine with only aa couple of moments where the games would freeze. No biggie. Then it died. No problem, sent it in for repairs under warranty. Free of charge. Cool. Got it back and it played well with me actually beating Ghost Recon with no problems. I stopped playing for a while but when I tried playing again BAM! Ring of Death. Warranty over. $130-140 dollars to fix. Yay. I think I'm going to throw it against the wall and buy a new one. Hopefully Microsoft has found all the solutions to the defects."
5,Truely Enjoy My 360,"I have had my 360 since March and I have had NO problems at all with it. No overheating problems at all. If you take care of your investment then it should work fine. I never thought I would own a Xbox of any kind, then I started looking at the game titles Micrsoft was accumulating and said wow. I am currently playing Gears Of War, and this game is amazing. The graphics on the 360 are are second to none. I also enjoy XBL. I don't care if I have to pay $50.00 per year and the PS3 is free, remember you get what you pay for. I can download game and video demos and still play a game at the same time. On the PS3 you can download and that is about it, you have to wait for the download to finish before playing a game. Microsoft also did an update were I can play games in 1080P. I am SOOOOOO glad i bought the 360 instead of waiting for a PS3, which is having their own heating issues right now."
2,Great When it works,"I am not one to complain much but i feel microsoft is being a bit ridiculus. my system was great when it worked but now its a $400+ paperweight with less then 24 hrs of game time on it. In the middle of playing Gears of war it stopped being able to read the game disks, or any disk for that matter. Now I have to send it back for service. And from what Im reading Im one of the lucky ones who still have there waranty. just plain bad. Very disapointed."
2,Unreliable,"Broke down 4 times already, I only play Halo with my friends. the 360 design is so weak comparing to play station, Wii, or even my old xbox, which is still working ,, i dont know whats wrong: the overheating, corrupted hard drive, Doesnt read disks ""open tray error"", you name it, and on top of that I had to pay $120.00 to fix each time, they give you a warrenty on the 3 red lights and they forget to tell you that once it breaks down it will not stop!! and its not covered by the warranty. I will NEVER recomend it to anybody, stick with PS3 or Wii if you can and save yourself the pain ."
2,If they ever got the quality issues resolved.,"I first purchased my Xbox 360 9 months ago and since then I have had three consoles that have failed. The first video output died, the second I received the red ring of death and the third the dvd drive would fail to recognize dvd's and games. I would not purchase this time without getting a extended warranty of some kind and be open to the idea of not having your console for a month while getting repaired. If not for the great games coming out and xbox live I don't think anyone would be buying these."
5,Works great,"I got my 360 last year at this time. I took it overseas with me deploying with the military and brought it back home. I've used it non-stop, playing games and movies. My system has been left on for days at a time and no problems arose. I keep it on it's side as I have a customized faceplate that looks better that way. I have numerous games and have been very pleased with the gameplay and graphics. Never had any issues with the system."
2,$399.99 for a console I occasionally can use when it is not in for service!,"First off, the Xbox360 has great games for the system and the online play is top notch.The downside is that I am now on my third Xbox360 as a result of the ""Red Ring of Death"". I purchased this system when the price was $399.99 and it lasted 6 weeks, than died and I got refurbished unit since my original was unrepairable. This next unit lasted about a year until last week it died. This time I sent my unit in and got the same one back. I hope the saying is true that ""the third time is a charm"" because this is ridiculous. With failure rumors of the Xbox360 to be around 33% I am wondering how many are repeats?I have since bought a PS3 as well...the PS3 is worth every penny. It is a beautifully designed console and is now in price competition with the Xbox360, did i mention the built in Blu-Ray? Nice!Purchase the Xbox360 with the mindset of not if the unit will fail but when!"
2,Maybe,"Great system, great games and lots of fun...but...This system has a CONFIRMED failure rate of 33%. Sure you get a three year warranty with it, but do you really want to buy something you know you are going to have to send out for months at a time to get fixed. The 33% failure includes all models!!! Even new ones. I love my 360 and the games are great, but I cannot recommend other people buying something that will probably fail."
1,Stay away! Breaks frequently! Warranty service from bad to worse!!,"I bought this product on Xmas last year as a present for my fiancee. We had several problems with it. It broke for the 3rd - YES, 3RD - time two weeks ago and guess what: After talking with the representative on the phone she said that the turn around is 4 - 6 weeks!!!!It used to be 15 days or so, now it's 4 to 6 weeks to get your system back, and when I asked why and that it must be a mistake her answer was ""Yes, it use to be that 15 days but now that we have extended our warranty at no extra cost the wait time has to be longer"". I cannot be more upset with this. I don't know how a company can pull this out and not be held accountable for the product they put on the market."
1,XBOX 360 IS A FAILURE!!!!,"The xbox 360 sucks,it cuts off in 30 minutes!But it cost a fortune.Instead of spending 300-400 bucks you might as well wait for the nintendo revolution.Nintendo says it will be less expensive plus it better.Hey i just dont want to buy a game thats $60 bucks.TRUST ME its not worth it.besides its graphics are the same as the first xbox,dont make me laugh."
5,Great System,This is the best system out. I played ps3 and it not as good as this. This has great online play and it is alot of fun. This system is more for teens and not kids. The ps3 sucks compares to this. The ps3 might be more powerfull and have blue ray but this has better games and could have just as good of graphics. If you really want a good deal on this go to [...]. They have better deals there than here but overall this is the best system i have ever played
1,Totally not what I expected,"I bought the Xbox 360 premium system 3 weekends ago and I took it back for a full refund the following weekend. I had trouble with the console locking up on me, and overheating. It was only a matter of 2 or 3 minutes of turning it on when it began to blow hot heat out the back of the console......it was just like having a space heater running in my bedroom. I assume it was on it's way to the ""Ring Of Death"" and that's why I took it back. The games aren't that great either. I feel the system was very rushed and has poor quality in the machines. My advice is avoid the Xbox 360. The origial Xbox is twice the machine and I have never had any problems with it."
2,What a joke!,"The situation at hand is criminal. The first time i played my new 360 after about 40 min it shut down, man u should have felt the heat emmitting from the vents of the console, i later discovered that this is a common problem with the new units. My brother went to buy one and coudnt find any as all retailers are sold out, lo and behold out come these stupid packages that the big retail chains are putting together and all cost around $800 to $900 each. Before they announced the launch the price was stated as being between $299 and $399. Now why hasnt the Dept of Justice stepped in to stop this incredible over pricing, do they take us the consumer for idiots? I dont know how long this will carry on for but something really needs to be done about it, ive returned mine, got my refund and wont buy another until the problems are fixed and the pricing is fair."
1,Break down is insane,"The system is fun when it actually works, but I am currently on my 4th repaired system which keeps destroying the dvd drive and any disk that is in their currently. Microsoft refused to replace GoW when the DVD destroyed it last time, but they finally just let me get a new system. Buyers beware, you might want to get the extended warrenty if you are any kind of gamer as this thing falls apart upon touching it."
1,NIGHTMARE!!!,received defective back in July `06.Has been repaired 3 times.Still waiting for the HD to be returned after the unit was returned w/o it. They now claim I didn`t ship the HD w the unit bc their is a discrepancy btwn what the xbox console + HD weigh and the weight of the box they received. Unbelievable!Have called customer service at 1.800.740.9269 least 20 times.I have been given at least 20+ reference #`s.Difficulty in communicating w the cust sv reps bc of their inability to clearly understand English.Only reason I called sooo many times is bc my 8 yr old nephew is very unhappy he can`t get his present back from the repairman.I have stopped payment through AMEX.DON`T BUY! DON`T BUY!! DON`T BUY!!! DON`T BUY!!! DON`T BUY!!!
1,not worth the money,I can't believe someone will buy a $400 game console that is a pieace of junk. It has the worst games ever. The graphics for it are horrible. I'm going to wait and save my money on the PS3.
1,HATE IT,"I hate this console. I just got it and for about ten minutes of playing it,IT frezzes up. (...). May next console will be the PS3."
1,FLOP in Progress Please Stand By!,"the 360 is a total flop, faulty harware,outdated hardware,no full HD, i dont hate MS, i have a xbox but the 360 is just.....well plain crap, wait to see what Nintendo and Sony have to offer, the 360 is a pass console"
1,Very dissapointing.....,"This system is not worthy of being a next-gen console, but thats not really the problem. Microsoft did not think of the gamers when creating the 360 (big surprise there). The backwards compatibility is not native. No accessories, especially memory cards, work with the system that worked with the old xbox. The system is loud, with an annoying ""whine"" when the DVD spins up. The D pad is very poorly designed. The old white and black buttons have been replaced with shoulder buttons (some games this may be a plus). I bought several of the top games, and they are just prettier than the old xbox games, not better. Same old crap under the pretty wrapping. There is no ""Wow!"" factor with this system. I could write many more picky problems I found with my experience playing the 360, but the bottom line is I am returning this one and sticking with Nintendo for my gaming for now, at least they are all about the gamer and have different, innovative games."
3,Just wait a bit....,"What's on this site and ebay is way to expensive for this system. Just wait until March, and you can buy it for a lot less. Personally, I'm going to trade in my old xbox, and see if I can get a discount. Sweet."
3,Needs Some Fine Tuning,"I have to say that this is a fun and essential system to have to experience any Next-gen games that are set to come out in the next few months. I have experienced many of the draw backs that a few other customers have complained about, namely that the system sometimes crashes when there seems to be too much processing going on. Yet this seems to happen only with a few graphic intensive games (Oblivion) and I've heard that it's a disc eater as well, though I haven't experienced this yet. I think Microsoft is working hard to iron out the kinks in the meantime, you may want to wait before purchase. It's a good system, but it could be better. I am currently debating whether or not I'll trade it in towards a PS3."
4,"Very Good, but has a fairly big price tag","This system is hard to aquire, do to the ignorance of retailers and there bundles. The system price will die down and become even more succesfull. The games I viewed at E3 showed me that Microsoft is heading in a good direction, Nintendo is heading in a better direction, and Sony shot itself in the foot. The 360 has a $[...] price tag. I'm going to get it, but I don't like the price tag. The Wii is better in the way it produces it's new controller, and the PS3 is good, but will not have very high sales, do to the $[...] price. The 360 is an excellent choice, especially in about 6 months."
1,"After 10 months, I already got the three red flashing lights...","If you are considering buying an xbox 360, you must first find out about the three flashing red lights problem (a hardware problem that most xbox 360 have). I own an xbox 360 and after 10 months I already had this problem. Find out if the new xbox 360's could have this problem too. If you are considering on buying an xbox 360 or a PS3...I would recommend the PS3, I have had the chance to play it and I loved it, I should have bought that one."
1,Worst sytem launch ever!,"Overpriced, not available, no A+ titles, gliches,""bundels"", multiple system types. Barely backwords compatible. Some games don't look better than this generation. Could Microsoft have screwed this up anymore? Does anyone there have any knowledge of how to do it right? Doesn't look like it. This sytem will NOT win this generation. I could tell microsoft how to do it, but they wouldn't want to here it, since they already think they know."
1,Not good,"We gave the game system to our sons for Christmas, didn't have it running more than 2hours and it overheated, had to contact Nintendo, we sent it back, still don't have a new one. Very disappointing."
1,be aware of amazon.com,"Warning, do not use credit cards when buying from amazon. If amazon makes a mistake they wont pay for your interest and they will give you a refund in almost 6 months(while the credit card still charges you with an interest). (...)"
1,What a piece of junk!!,"I thought I was lucky when I purchased the last Xbox 360 core system three weeks ago from a local Walmart. It turns out to be a piece of junk.Not to mention the radiculously sized power adapter, the console itself was poorly designed and engineered. It is ugly, noisy and fagile. The console has to remain absolutely still when you playing games or DVDs. If you happen to touch it or move it just a little bit with your wired controller, it stops working instantly, and gives you an error message on the screen. Even without any motion, it overheats every 15-20 minutes. I had to shut the whole thing off and on to restart the game.I have an old HP desktop computer made in 2000 in my media room. I am telling you the cooling fan in the Xbox 360 is 10 times noisier than my old HP desktop.Well, I just returned the console back to Walmart yesterday. I will have to sell the wireless controller and 4 xbox360 games on e-bay.No wonder X-box has only less than 15% of market share in Japan."
2,People get PlayStation 3...,"I'll wait when the Xbox 360 drops the price when PS3 comes out. I did my research on Xbox 360 is going have add-on HD DVD, it reminds me the good old days of Sega CD add-on which was a waste of money. PS3 will have a Blue-Ray built into the console, instead Xbox 360 uses DVD formant. PS3 have all the backward capabilities for PS1 and PS2 games, plus it will play CD, DVD, and Blue-ray itself. PS3 have 6 USB ports, 2 HDMI ports, built-in digital optical surround sound, Xbox 360 doesn't have all the features. PS3 is twice as powerful than Xbox 360. PS3 will match the same price as Xbox 360. PS3 will have better launch than Xbox 360, did. Even though I own Xbox, PS2, Gamecube, and the Dreamcast. Xbox 360 gotta have worse launch titles, ever. PS3 is going blow Revolution and Xbox 360. Down the road I'll probably get all new-gen systems in the future."
3,Why?,Now i'm not saying that this is a bad system... What i am saying is for $500 you can watch blu-ray on the PS3. For the 360 if you want to watch hi-def movies you have to buy a $200 stand alone box for a total of $600 all without a 60GB hard drive. The PS3 is one box that's it. If you don't have a hi-def television that you should buy the stock 360. But it's pretty dumb to go cheap on the next-generation of entertainment.Also get a waranty. I have a friend who's 360 broke about 360 days after buying.
1,The Xbox 360 Secret,"The Xbox 360 only plays a few games from the old Xbox system. Microsoft continues to be quiet about this hiccup in the system. I was disappointed to find out I cannot play any of my NBA Live games from 2005 - 2007 on Xbox 360 because the only update they have is for NBA Live 2004. What kind of sense does that make? I am sure not too many people play that game anymore so why would they even update it? Why would they ignore the newer games? It has been a year since the Xbox 360 launch and still no updates... So be very careful before you buy this system and do your research to see if it will play the games, you want it to play."
1,"Live is good, but hardware is unreliable","Live is good, but with the monthly fee it should be! If you buy this, make sure you get the extended warranty from microsoft and any other warranty you can get. mine died!"
1,Count on it breaking,"I have owned an original XBOX and XBOX 360 and both broke in the same way after about a year of playing, not even playing much. Microsoft wants $140 to fix them, and only gives a warranty of 90 days after that. It is widely known that XBOX used poor-quality Thompson Disc Drives in the first XBOXs (which I had), and many many problems have plagued the XBOX 360. I have heard that as many as 25% of machines were defective straight out of the box, and many more, like mine, broke down after the warranty expired. A $400 paperweight is not much fun."
1,Xbox 360,"The Xbox did not work. Had to send it back to Microsoft. These Xbox's should be fully tested BEFORE sending out to customers. The lady at UPS said they have had to send ""A lot"" of the Xboxes back."
1,BUNDLES SUCK!,[...]YOU HAVE TO PAY $1000 TO GET THIS SYSTEM WITH A BUNCH OF GAMES YOU DON'T WANT.AT THE VERY LEAST WE SHOULD HAVE A CHOICE OF GAMES.LEAVE IT TO THESE BIG RETAILERS TO TAKE THE JOY OUT OF GIFT GIVING.
1,"Save your money, buy the 65mm chip set in 08.","Save your money, and a big headache. I had this system, it was awesome when I first got it. But it died on me, with the 3 red lights problem that's being posted all over the internet. I got it replaced by Microsoft only to get another faulty system that scratched my disks. So, I sold it and bought a Playstation 3.Wait for the 65mm chip set, Microsoft is trying to sale out these FAULTY units. Before they bring in the better SKUs, if you don't want a headache in the future, I suggest you wait it out.Oh, and Microsoft didn't replace my disks that were scratched.. >_<"
4,"Fun, pure fun!","I am so sick of hearing how good the PS3 is. Truth is, the PS3 and the 360 are not that much different in performance, and sony's highly toted online play's not that spectacular. Its just not. So, here goes a review from a smart person, who does not give into lies and false info.Who ever's bashing the shape of the consoles a prick on society. That automatically makes the 360 a bad console, ya right.The games for the 360 are awsome. Like, freaken sweet. Gears of war, Elder Scrolls, halo 3 and many many more. Whats PS3 got? Kill crap?The controller is very good and responsive, and you gotta love the hard drive. And online? The best thing to happen to you in a LOOONG time. XBOX live is the best, but true, you do have to pay in order to play online. But, the downloadable contents the best, and the ps3 from what i hear lags a whole lot.Dont listen to sony, listen to reason. XBOX 360 has got great games out already, and it only cost 300$ less then the PS3, for a better console.Max"
4,Its good if u get........,the thing u need is a inside cooler for the 360 it tends to heat up and in some cases but very rare melt the game in side
1,"Fun when it works, BEWARE OF RELIABILITY ISSUES","The 360 has the best game library as of summer 2007. There really is only one major issue with it, the reliability of the hardware. Do yourself a favor and do a google search of 360 failure rates. What good is a fun system with great games if it doesn't work? The failure rates are horrendous.. much , much higher than the admitted 5%."
1,It was great while it lasted,"I have had an xbox 360 for about a year now. It was amazing being able to watch HD-DVD's and be able to play next-gen video game.Then just 2 days ago, the three red lights lit up around the power button. I called microsoft and they said it was a hardware faliure and that they would charge $139 just to repair it.At least I have a ps3, which when played with a good HDMI cable, completely destroys 360. I will admit that HD-DVD movies are better than Blu-Ray, but they are just barely better. Microsoft's games aren't even in a next-gen format, where as Sony's are in Blu-Ray.I hate to be bashing microsoft like that, but to make a product that will only last for a year and costs $400 is awful. But as I said in my title, I loved the 360 and am more just pissed at it's lack of durability"
1,Class action law suite needed,"I got my 360 at launch. It worked great until, I decided to use it as a dvd. It overheated and Microsoft wants $140 to fix plus shipping. Its just wrong. They need to take care of the customer!!"
3,Great when It's not being repaired,"Love the 360 untill the three rings of death showed up. microsoft is now extending the warranty to three yearsand says its going to cost over a billion, they charged me 140.00 to fix mine do the math thats more than 3 to5% microsoft says its having a problem with more like 40%. It's great when it works love the games and online play. If sony drops the price (I hear next week) of the playstation 3 before I get my 360 back I will probably get one, even though I have over 1500.00 in games,console,and accessories. Hope this review helps someone."
4,No. 2!,"Received my refurbished 360,w/different serial no..My Intercooler is hooked up to it,so I hope it stays running for a good while.New review,RROD has hit me too,guess the motherboard got warped,now I sent it to Texas(Mexico) to get repaired.Thinking about getting another one or plunge and get a PS3. I guess I'm one of the few lucky ones.I've had my 360 for a year now,no RROD yet,but I do not use my 360 12-18 hours a day like some would,going on online and stuff like that.It will probably happen to me too soon,hey,I've had three(3) PS2's,so it happens to everybody sooner or later.The more high tech our consoles get,and the way they(Sony,Microsoft,Nintendo) have to put out these consoles faster,or maybe we could wait longer so they could test them more before they put them out,yeah right!LOLReceived my 360 back,received a replacement version,see how long its lasts.I'll hook up my Intercooler EX,see if it keeps cool enough for no RROD."
1,Fun While It Lasted,"I had mine exactly a year and two days when I got the red ring of death. I found out that 3 out of 10 Xbocx360's made durring the time of October-November 2005 had the life span of about a year...just right after the warranty ends. Now I have a $399.99 paper weight. Isn't that nice?I understand that they have extended this warranty, but what about the rest of us?My advice? Find out the manufacture date, if you can, before you buy it."
1,Too bad this console is not stable,"I hade the unit for about 12 months. This thing freezes up constantly and at the worst times. I sent it sent back to microsoft to be fixed, that took one month and in the end it still freezes up. I traded it in at EB Games for store credit AND A SERIOUS LOSS OF $$$. Ill wait for a WII.The frustration and loss of $$$ is why I am only willing to give this thing 1-star"
1,"So much promise, but 3 bad machines...!","My kids had the first x box, and so it seemed to me that they would like to get the new one when it came out. I went to a lot of trouble to get one for them for christmas the first year. They really enjoyed the games, but then after about two weeks (a lot of use) it started showing red lights.Microsoft took that one back to repair it, and the next one lasted 3 weeks before it showed red lights. Finally the third one came which did not burn up. However, one day I noticed a disc out of its case with a big scratch on it and I got mad at the kids saying that they needed to take better care of the games since they are expensive. Of course it turned out that the console was doing the scratching, putting rings on the discs.When I now read that Microsoft admits a 33% failure rate, it makes me angry. I would avoid this one."
1,Great if it weren't junk,The 360 could have been a great system. Unfortunately it is a piece of junk. I have had to send mine in for repair and out of 10 people I know who have 360s only 1 has not died yet.A piece of junk.
1,Brand New and Defective,"Right out of the box, mine was hanging at the Xbox splash screen. It would occasionally boot past the splash screen, but then the wireless controller would randomly lock and not work.Back to Amazon it goes ... [sigh] With crying kids here that had thought they were going to be experiencing the XBox tonight! Their gaming experience was reduced to having to watch some neat flashing red lights.Lot: 0615S/N: B4J6040431"
2,Way Too Loud. Disappointed.,"Too loud (fact)Not enough *good* games (opinion)More expensive than PS3 (fact if you consider a Hi-Def dvd player and wifi)Better controller than PS3 (opinion)If you like to watch hi def movies, the 360 noise *will* bother you. Watching Transformers? Maybe not as much. Watching Planet Earth? Definitely annoying.Opinion: Buy the PS3 and a Toshiba A2 and you end up with BOTH formats for LESS than just the 360 w/HD & wifi. And the PS3 game selection is very good unless you need more than 20 games at a time. Personally, I play 2-3 games and they last me a few months, then add another game here or there as something cool is released. To each their own. My opinion is the PS3 is a superior platform."
2,"6 Months Old, Red Lights of Death","Very fun system (especially NCAA Football 2007), but after 6 months I've got nothing but the red lights of death now. Frustrating. Buy the extended warranty, and back up your dynasty file to an external memory card after every game ..."
3,Where is the help?,"It strikes again! The continuous lock ups, and no help from anyone. Especially Amazon. You would think that with the buying power Amazon has it could put pressure on Microsoft to fix the problems. Amazon where is the help? The first 4 months were great, and then the pain set in, until the eventual demise of the system. I am not a hard core gamer, and maybe play a couple of times a week. So, is it worth the money? Nope. Not until they fix the problems."
2,This bundling is ridiculous,"Anyone notice that retailers are refusing to sell just the core or premium consoles? Consoles are completely unavailable, unless you purchase a ""bundle"" for several hundred dollars over the console price.This is an intentional effort by MS and the retailers to move software titles. Nobody has consoles, but they are magically available as bundles.That's a big gamble and may fully backfire. I am not buying a bundle and if that means I don't get a 360, so be it."
2,Red Rings of Death,"I purchased my Xbox 360 from Best Buy in March 2006. It took exactly 13 months for it to give me the 3 flashing red rings, which means hardware failure. The system is useless after this occurs. I had an extended warranty and returned it to Best Buy. They told me that since it was after the manufacture's warranty of 1 year, that they would only do one replacement and that was it. These systems seem to be failing at a extrememly high frequency. Beware!"
2,XBOX 360 RED RING OF DEATH,"So I decided to let the initial XBOX 360 go through the bugs before I got one. I've heard many stories of disk eating and overheating in the first batch of consoles. I got mine last August with a June built date. My son and I had many fun nights playing Gears of War, Lost Planet, Crackdown and NBA Street till last night when the dreaded RED RING OF DEATH struck! A few more months and I would not have been covered by the warranty (1 year). Buyers beware.On the side note, XBOX 360 help desk was great and worked with me to get my cosole fixed ASAP."
3,Nothing special,"Finally I'm able to write something. Xbox 360 is nice. I've seen it. I'm not comparing this to PS3 or NR. Xbox 360 should be for fps people like me. However,I gave it 3 because of all the problem going on. It's been ridiculous of all the overheating, freezing, deathscreen that has been going on. Even worse, when you move your little box when it's playing, the disk will get ""eaten"" or heavily scatched that you probably can't play it again. Microsoft says that it is only a small proportion of the consoles, however the ""eating"" is for EVERY cosole."
1,XBOX 360 Has Serious Problems,"We bought an XBOX 360 in April. The graphics are great, and the games are fun. But don't ever download updates and make sure you buy the extended warranty. In order to continue playing XBOX live, the system required us to download an update. Shortly thereafter, the system began locking up regularly. As the problem got worse, it locked up while playing Gears of War and the DVD head hit the disk while it was spinning and put a big scratch all the way around the disk - rendering it useless. A day later, the system would no longer even start. Microsoft won't admit responsibility and forced us to pay $140 to get our game system fixed. So, the XBOX 360 didn't really cost $399, it cost $539 plus shipping. Perhaps Playstation 3 or Wii will be more reliable."
4,Great system!,"I've been out of gaming for many years until I went to my friend's house and saw him playing COD3 on the 360 in HD. I was in awe. The next week I went out and bought one. I have not regretted it once. The only problem I have with the 360 is that EVERYTHING that you need costs extra. The HD-DVD player ($179), the wireless adapter ($99), extra controller ($40), XBox Live ($50/yr). As far as available games and game play goes though, I love it and would buy one again."
5,Superior gaming experience,"I purchased the Xbox 360 for my teenage son. He already has the original Xbox system and wanted to try the new experience with the internet included. He was absolutely thrilled to be able to not only find other players online, but to be able to TALK to them with the headset was even more fun! System is reliable, easy to set up and take down and is portable, easy to carry. 5 starts for sure!"
3,Greatest fragile product ever.,"This systems is a all of 5 star for me. However, I have had my 360 since launch and after yesterday I will be on my 5th system. I am fortunate that they all have been fixed for free. Great selection of games.Great games worth checking out are Bioshock, Madden 08 and more. I am a owner of all 3 sytems and this system is starting to take up more of my time."
5,Right up next to the Wii.,"I bought this a few days ago, because the lack of games for the Wii, which I also own, was getting very annoying. I bought a used one for $190.00, an extra hard drive, an extra controller, and Gears of War. I couldn't be happier. The console is great. The graphics are perfect, the games are great, and everything runs quite smooth. It did freeze up on me once, but just that one time. It seems to stay pretty cool, but I have it raised up by the sides so that air gets all around. Xbox Live is awesome. You get a 30 day Xbox Live Gold trial when you open a Xbox Live account, which is really nice. I've had a fun time killing people on Gears of War. This is definitely a must buy for people who want good games, great graphics, great online, and just want to have fun."
3,great if you get one that works,Had a hard time getting one working out of the box (came broken). Called Microsoft but they were no help.... Amazon took care of everything though and made sure I had a working product. Once it was up and running it was great.
2,Fun until red lights go on,I purchased my Xbox 360 in summer of 2006 I have enjoyed up until last weekend when all of the sudden the system froze which is annoying but not surprising because it has happend before. Only this time when I went to reset the system I had 3 red flashing lights go on and the console was no longer responding. Fortunatly although my waranty is over this is common problem and microsoft is going to repair it. I am somewhat annoyed about it because it will take 3-4 weeks.
1,BEWARE! Buy the warranty.....or you'll be so sorry...,"We have had our 360 for a few months now and were relatively pleased with it. Although there really arent that many great games out for it right now. Really should have waited for more. Our system is dead now, it locked up with the notorious ""Ring of Death"" after freezing a few times. Of course, Microsoft will gladly repair it for 129 dollars but even thats not guaranteed. Check out the XBOX forum, this is a common problem that they will not address. If you buy this machine you are in for a lot of hassles. Plan on buying the warranty and on having to contact microsoft repeatedly to get your system fixed, not to mention the down time while waiting for them to ""refurbish"" it. This is the first console that I have EVER had break in less than 6 months so I definitely wont replace...Just wait for the Wii !!"
1,Trouble with X-Box 360,"I have had my Xbox 360 for 4 months and have had trouble from day one. The tech support was not helpful. I have had trouble with the games freezing during play and now none of my five games will play at all. I have had to return my console to microsoft for repair. When I took the console to UPS, the staff said they have seen tons of returns of these systems. I find the length of the warranty (six months) to be alarming as I won't have much (if any) time to insure proper play once it is returned from repair. I would not recommend this system to anyone. The price is too steep for such a poorly developed product with such little support."
1,Regret,I spent more than $700 with this console. First Wireless $100. Live $60. Then $100 Hd-dvd adapter which is not as good as bluray. Plys rechargable batterries and a fan. that is 700. I not happy with this console. It keeps on constantly breaking down with the 3 rings of death. Obvouisly this is only a 4 year system. Halo 3 is its last game. I really regret getting this system. Shouldve gotten a PS3. Dont do the same mistake that I did get this reallly!PlayStation 3 (60GB)
1,OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This thing is deadly.Okay I started to play my xbox360,andI was playing call of duty 2,and all of sudden my mom calls me for dinner.So while we were eating,like 10 mins later we smelledsomething burning,so we ran to the basement to find my xbox360in flames!Thank God we were able to get it out,it was a smallfire and did noy burn to many things,but if we did'nt evensmell any thing are whole house would be in flames!Later we went to take it back to best buy,and they gave us aremoney back.I really wanted another one but my mom said no.I guess I have to get a nintendo revolution,or a playstation 3LOL,my bro said that Bill Gates and his company microsoft areteaming up with aliens to destroy the world by installing amatch and gasoline in every xbox 360!I laughed for a bit thenrealized maybe its true!"
1,"Xbox, one more product about Microsoft.","Like any other product of Microsoft the first month is fully functional, Xbox Live, No Crashes, everything seems to be a lot of fun. But when the 1st month ends the Xbox Live goes to Silver Membership that the only feature of this membership is that you can download a lot of junk, the ""quality"" content has a ""little"" prize that you have to affort plus the high price of the games. The games have a high definition but the gameplay is not as good. The console get crashes in the middle of a lot of games and need to be restart it. Anyway this is not what I expect for the prize. I'm still waiting for the always stable console, Playstation 3."
4,ps3 vs xbox 360,"the success of PS2 proved one thing, you dont have to have superior technonogy or graphics to be on top in the console buisiness. What matters is getting a better selection of games and releasing your system at a critical time. This generation, sony and microsoft appear to have switched roles; microsoft releasing a system early with over 20 games available at release, and sony releasing an (apparently) superior system way later.I believe that the PS3 will outsell the 360 for two reasons: first, those looking for the best features (previously xbox customers) will find a more powerful system in the PS3. 2nd, most casual gamers will want to be able to play their old games on their new console, leading most back to sony (but myself back to microsoft). thusfar, the 360 is sold out about everywhere, so it is possible that yet again, the release date will triumph."
4,Worth the $$$$,"A little pricey, but worth it if you are into and appreciate videogames. To fully appreciate the system you should use both the LIVE service and hook the 360 to a hi-def tv. Then the system really shines. The fact is there is no other device on the market that integrates online play as well as the 360. PS3 is not even close in terms of integration, security and community.Back when I made the decision to purchase the original Xbox over the PS2 (I was coming from a PS1 and a big fan of Sony) it was based on what I concluded to be Microsoft's vision of online gaming and ""whatever it takes"" attitude to make them the best in the business. (And knowing that they would spend whatever $$ is necessary to be successful). I have never looked back since. The 360 continues the drive and ambition.In the end, all you need to do is look at the software avail. on the system and what is coming in the future. Software is what ultimately makes or breaks a system, and the 360 lineup is EXTREMELY strong."
4,Is it worth the price,"While the Xbox is great technically, you need games that are engaging to make the hardware useful. Are the racing games that much better than what's available on the PS2? So far I don't think so. However there are a lot of unique features that the developers haven't completely taken advantage of. The true test is whether or not there will be a lot of choices one year from now. The life span should be at least 5 years for this unit. For now I have a few games I play but I'll reserve judgement until there is another bunch of games on the market."
3,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!,"This product is junk ive had mine now for a total of 4 month and its already breaking. I take great care of it and its still going down hill the games will not eject and it wont read themm half the time anyway and its not just mine all 5 of my friends are haveing the same problem im having 2 of which are on the second one and the problems are still reoccuring. If you are looking to waste your money then look no further, if you think for 1 sec that the problems im having wont happen to you Think again!!!!"
5,I'll Get Back To You...............,"...........unfortunately my son was home when it arrived back in early January and I haven't once been able to play it. He seems to enjoy it. I haven't seen him since early January either. He's been in his room playing ""The Godfather"" on MY X-Box 360. He said it plays DVD's better than my regular DVD player. I wouldn't know."
1,Mine died too!,"Our console is past warranty and yes, 3 red lights! Very disappointed to say the least! No I will not pay microsoft to ""fix"" it but since I enjoy Elder Scrolls and have preordered Halo 3 I will invest in a core 360 and use my old hard drive from my premium dead system. I will get a 3 year store warranty for only $29 at Target. So I figure during the next 3 years I will probably get 3 more xbox's at the going death rate for only $29.99. Yes!Update: Trade in your dead system at gamestop or ebgames for $110!Good news!"
1,360 Warranty - Be Cautious,"Don't count on the Microsoft warranty after they give you the first replacement 360. I encountered the 3 red lights on my 9 month old 360. Microsoft sent me a replacement 360 in September of '06. The replacement 360 now has the 3 red lights and does not work. Microsoft just told me that the replacement 360 is out of the warranty period as I purchased the original 360 more than a year ago. I replied that the replacement 360 has a warranty of its own that is separate and apart from the original 360 as it is a completely different console. MS Support replied that I had a number of options, those were pay a $130 fee, buy a new 360 or stop gaming."
4,un-biased opinion,"the xbox 360 is a GREAT machine. best console for next generation gameing. the graphics and gameplay are both excellent and you wont be disapointed in that area of the console. here are my pros and cons-CONS-has a 2 to 10 chance you get a dysfuntyonal system. (but it's ok if you have the warenty)corrupt data is hard to fix/bad custermer supportPROS-best games oof 2007 are comeing out for the xbox 360next gen software allows it to expan the usegraphics are more detailed than eververy easy to connect to reqular and HD tvxbox live is multy media (not only do you play games but you can download movies, shows, demos, traliers, and arcade games)/ cost 4 dollars a monthThough their are alot of great things about it, the problems can casue alot of trouble so buy the warrenety!!!!!!!!"
1,XBOX 360 AT AMAZON,"I'm still waiting for my pre-ordered XBOX 360, and I'm sure the wait will be worth it, but the prices listed here on Amazon are a total disgrace!! I can't believe people would actually price gouge like this. How do you sleep at night??"
4,Good Gaming System,"I personally like the Xbox 360. It think it has great games, great graphics, and other cool media features. (warning: do not buy the core system it is Extremely stripped down). So yeah like i said DO NOT BUY THE Core system, it is stripped down to the point where it isn't even fun, so i reccommend buying the ($...) version. The only thing about it is it doesn't have any real new, mindblowing features like the PS3 or Wii. ALSO if u dont have an HDTV u cant get the gorgeuos graphics this thing can produceBottomline: If you want a great system and have an HDTV with great games and great graphics, this is the system for you!"
4,Excelent game console.... But.............,"Excelent console, but i think i got lots of issues that can be solve like, the overheat problem, the video issues (DVI C-Video) but in a overal i liked a lot."
5,Best Thing Ever!!!!!!!!!!,This is the best console ever. way better graphics that any other game system out there. The games are the best. Like Viva Pinata. I totally love this console and you have to buy it. Dont miss out on this great buy you will be very happy with you purchase.Best Thing Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,BULL SHT,ALL OF THESE STORES ARE STEALING EVERYONES MONEY...NEXT SPRING WHEN PS3 COMES OUT THIS SYSTEM WILL BE LIKE 200$ BUNCH OF CROOKS
3,First impressions,"Amazon solicited me for a review of this product (by email) so here goes although I can't really tell much. I bought this console for my 2 sons and it was not until they had received it that I learned that it didn't come with any games, so it was useless until they either rented a game or I forked-out more dough to buy a game or two for them. While searching the games titles, I noticed there wasn't much choice, which is understandable since it's a relatively new product and old XBox games don't run on it (or maybe they do, I do NOT know). While searching for games to buy, I noticed that a couple of companies offer coolers for this console, which tells me it runs hot (which can be detrimental for the 20GB Hard drive), so that gives me a not-so-good impression. The XBox 360 is supposed to have superior graphics, a faster processor and - initially - Microsoft could not (and maybe STILL can not) meet demand. I still wonder if it's worth all that hoopla."
1,HEAR ME!,"LOOK AT THE PRICE. THAT SAYS SOMETHING DOESN'T IT?Also, although I do not have an Xbox360, you should still listen to the bad reviews and good reviews. Just because you were so hyped up to get the 360, doesn't mean it is flawless. I not saying that you shouldn't read the good reviews, but head the warnings of others."
1,Are you kidding me?,"I paid 400 dollars for 2 hardware malfunctions and xbox games. I see a little advance in the graphics, but its not that much at all. It still DVD format and doesn't hold enough. Hold off for the Revolution or Playstation 3 when the real next generation begins."
2,Good Potential,"The console allows for future addons which is a plus, but for its cost and graphics one can utilize a computer to have as much or more use than the console. The problems with the system would almost give one more reason to buy a separate HD DVD player than the add on since the add on HD DVD player cost as much as a player with a surround sound system. A computer also has warranties that cover any defects for many years. It is all up to the gamer on how versatile he wants his system."
1,Rip Off,"If you do not have an xbox 360, and are trying to beat the odds and get one now, don't buy it. First of all, with all the people that will sit in lines even if it is below freezing, will get the system. Secondly, the system is being overpriced on online retailers. I am not going to buy the Xbox 360 for $5,000 dollars on Ebay, or $1,000 dollars right here on Amazon. For god sakes, you could get a stinkin Plasma tv for that money. Third, almost all the games currently on Xbox 360 suck. There are no blockbusters like Halo out. Fourth, all the people that bought the xbox 360 the first day were Ebay freaks who wanted to amp up their profits a bit. None of them wanted to play the thing. Lastly, people are even filing lawsuits cause the Xbox 360 is so called not doing what it says it is supposed to do. So BOTTOM LINE, wait about a couple months to buy your Xbox 360, or do not buy it at all. It will save you tons of money."
3,This console is OK.,This console is cool. The only problem with is microsoft isn't producing alot and all the stores are sold out because each store got like 10 in and then they were gone the first minute that store opened. The xbox360 is also having problems.
2,xbox 360 sistem sucks,I have paying twice to fix this machine .that every 4-mohts need to be fix. for the heat problem I can cook a egg with the steen coming out of the vent of this machine. and microsoft charge for the repair $129.99 for only 3-mhonts garranty.and the sistem broke down on the 4 monht.for me is not cooincident.I like the sistem but my experience is frustrade. and beside you need to buy a garranty from microsift to fix the sistem if broke down after 3 m- aster they fix it.and for me that is a rip off.that is why I not recomended this sistem.have to many problem's.
1,no fun at all,"Don't buy,It isn't worth the money and every game I get sucks. save your money for the PS3."
1,What a waste of money,xbox 360 sucks for all you people that like the 360 because it is the best system out there yeah right I have played it at a friends house and it really sucks my friend owns Tony Hawk American Wasteland and I own it for the PS2 and the 360 version looks just like the PS2 version and I have played NBA 2k6 it looks the same as the PS2 version except for when you do a instant replay when you do an instant replay the players have sweat running down their faces WOW!!!! big thing PS2 doesn't have that because it is not as new as the XBox 360 If I were you I would wait for the PS3 because the PS3 will allow you to play all of your PS2 and PS1 games and it will upgrade them to PS3 Quality and the PS3 has a Blue Ray High Def system the 360 does not You can't even play all of your old XBox game on the 360Peace out
1,COPYCATS! by the way im 13,i can not believe that microsoft has the nerve to copy the sony ps2. i mean other than the good graphics is there a diffrence? NO. usb ports? the ps2 has them. cd/dvd player? the ps2 has them. and guess what. the ps2 is HALF the size and price the 360 is. you can buy the ps2 and SEVEN games and still have 10 dollars left. so do the right thing and buy the playstation 2. or at LEAST the original xbox.
5,THE BEST THING IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I want this game because it is so cool. My dad keeps on saying that there sold out but I dont believe him.
2,"Broke again, and no I don't want to buy an extended warranty","My 360 is going back to Microsoft for the second time. To be fair the one I am currently sending back was a replacement so technically I've sent two consoles back, one time each. It's the same problem you've read about all over the place, games freeze, then three flashing red lights of death. Tech support is a bunch of teenagers reading from a script that uses the line ""I'm very sorry for that, I will help you to the best of my ability"" way too many times. They deal with the problem, but keep telling me I need to buy the extended warranty to make sure I don't have to pay for any future repair. Babe, when I have to start paying for Microsoft's failures I buy Sony."
5,my savior :),"i am a guy from Kuwait and bought xbox360 from amazon knowingly that i may get a defective console and since iam out of usa the warrenty is useless and to make things worse i am not buying for me , iam buying for my uncle which he placed in my bank account 600$ (the extra 200 for games and joystick )after 20 days i reserved the console and guess what, their was no problem whats so ever hell i played the xbox360 for over 8 hours straight having a great time with the whole family (yes the xbox360 is for family,kids and ofcourse hardcore gamers :P) my uncle was extreamly pleased with the console that he even bought the sony bravia lcd ^^i know my English is bad , i just wanna say the xbox360 worth it and if you don't like ghost recon,gears of war,lost planet and upcoming games like mass effect blue dragon and lost odysee then please don't consider your self a gamer :)again iam sorry with the english :)"
1,"Broken Machine, not a good start","Well I got my xbox for Christmas yesterday and was very excited to sit down and play my gears of war. I turned on the machine and got an error code of E 57. I called customer service and had two choices, return to store for a new machine or mail in the hard drive and wait 6 weeks to play my xbox. I immediately cursed microsoft and kicked myself for ever trusting their crap products. I switched my home and laptop PC to macs last year after a disasterous 10 years of PC. I guess I can't wait until Apple releases their own system that ACTUALLY WORKS PROPERLY. My own stupid fault for believing in a quality microsoft product."
1,Microsoft con job,"As has happened with other reviewers, my son worked hard to save a LOT of money to buy this system (plus the investment in games and accessories), and ours only lasted 3 and a half months - just outside the pathetic warranty period. I am livid. No sales person ever told us (until a few weeks ago anyway) that a fan is a requirement or you can be guaranteed that the unit will overheat. We also found out later the problem of disks getting damaged so easily - particularly if the unit is stored vertically. This is appalling design and quality control for a system in this price range. Stick with Sony or Nintendo products."
2,Reliability Issues,"I bought an X-box on the first day with Perfect Dark Zero. The problem is that the game would lock up after about 15 minutes of play. So I had to send it back to get it replaced. I'm still waiting for the new one. Don't get this if you're buying a Christmas present. You may end up with dissatisfied children on Christmas Day. I recommend waiting until the summer to give them time to get the kinks out of the system. Also, by then, you'll be able to comparison shop all three next generation consoles. Take my word, it's too early to buy this."
1,Fun while it lasts.....,"The xbox 360 system is fun while it lasts. Unfortunately, it doesn't last long. Anyone considering getting this system NEEDS to get the extended warranty. They are notorious for breaking down. I know three other people that own a 360. Out of the 4 of us 3 of our systems have broken down all within months of owning one. MS will replace it for free as many times as needed for 1 year (And yes if you look on the web there are plenty of people who claim they are on their 3rd or 4th 360). After that one year it will cost you roughly $160 for repair and shipping. So do yourself a favor and just assume this system cost $460. $400 for the system and $60 for the 2 year warranty."
4,Fantastic,"Good product, good graphics. I also have an xbox. Showed it to a friend who wanted a PS3 ended buying 360 instead. Good step up. Even my dad loves it."
3,Great fun but low quality parts.,When setting up this system you realize that most parts are cheap plastic. They even seem a little filmsy from the audio video outputs to the power output connection. Getting past that this system is great. From XBox live to the games it's a great investment. If you are looking for the future it is here. We are yet to see whether the PS 3 will follow suit.
1,Reliable?????,"Was really fun for two days and then had ""internal failure"". At least AMAZON is great to work with to get resolved"
5,PERFECT!,This system will put Microsoft in the console lead. Not only are the games/graphics awesome but the online feature makes it a winner! Pick it up today!
1,My Xbox 360 Didn't Even Last 24 Hours!!!!,"I purchased this system brand new on May 29, 2006. While playing Fight Night Round 3, the damn machine stopped working!!!! It couldn't read any discs!!!! I had just purchased my Xbox 360 a few hours before this occurred!!!! I was hoping that it was just a faulty disc, but after trying to play my entire DVD collection on the Xbox 360, I sadly realized that my system would not recognize any discs!!!! I took my system back immediately and recieved a full refund. This was such a dreadful experience for me. I've had erections that have lasted longer than my Xbox 360 did!!!!!"
4,We forgive,"Any Microsoft product is a love-hate relationship. The 360 has the best games and the most versatlity. However it seems to be plauged with bugs. Often time I'll be playing a brand new game and at the most exciting part it'll freeze and give me a ""dirty or damaged disk"" error message. The system, at times, can be very frustrating. However, we forgive Microsoft because their games are so great. If you're planning to go wireless, make sure you will be using it near the router; I use mine in the opposite end of the house from the router and can never get a steady enough connection. Out of the 360, the PS3, and the Wii, the 360 is a must."
2,Red Ring of Death,Got the red ring of death today after only 10 months of use. Only solution is to send the console to Microsoft for repairs. This really is unbelievable.
1,amazon prices,I cannot believe that amazon is trying to sell X-box 360's for triple the price. It outrageous i mean 400 was already a steep price for anyone but diehards. Now they want they casual gamers to fork over more monkey. Forget it. They'll loose us in the market until the firts drops drastically. I was planning to get mine here but i guess i'll go somewhere else. I don;t want to be mean but i've waited for about a month to buy this and since i am a kid i cant do an overnight at my nearest Bestbuy. SO amazon drop the prices or i drop you.
1,wait and save,"I personally do not own a x box 360 but my cousin does and he lives next door. He stayed out overnight to get one and bought a deluxe version. We were playing CoD2 and it crapped out on us. we rebooted 5 times and it screw up again and again. I suggest waiting till all the bugs are fixed and the case fans are fixed. Also the price will drop from the outrageou 1,000+ sollars for each system. So wait till Amazon gets it through its head and lowers the price of the Xbox 360 -Stuey mchogin"
5,great!!!,i love the xbox360 i coudnt decide whether to get a ps3 or 360 and when i found out ps3 was 600 dollars and the games suck!.and the wii looks wiitarded and nobody wants the last gen systems!! and xbox360 is a fair price 400 dollars for a 20gb hardrive xbox live silver membership a wireless controller and michrophone headset!!.and ps3 is a overpriced piece of crap!!!.and xbox360 has all the good games!!. like halo wars halo 3 gears of war and elders scrolls 4 oblivion (which rocks) and wii has poor graphics weird controller and games are all the same like zelda excitetruck (seqeul to excitebick) dragonballz tenkaichi 2 call of duty 3 and tonyhawks downhill jam!.and xbox360 has its own good games i recommend xbox360!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! highly more then the nintendo wii and playstation 3 (piece of overpriced crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!).
5,Hmmmmm,I like the game system alot I don't own but I've got a question. Can you plug in 4 wired controllers because I don't see any place to on the pictures. I might just be an idiot and not notice it. I want to know because wired controllers are alot cheaper than wireless
1,"If you want fun, buy a PS3",I have played the Xbox 360 and was not impressed. The Nintendo Wii did not interest me. So i stuck with the best....Sony. People gun sony down but if you try the console you will fall in love with the graphics and the power!
2,Regret,"I'd so rather have my five-hundred dollars back. (includes cost of Gears Of War) As of my writing this review the 360 has not remotely procured five hundred bucks of entertainment for me, even with not having had any technical issues with the console as of yet. I can only hope Halo 3 relieves some, if not all, of my regret."
1,Don't buy it without an extended warranty,"I bought my son an Xbox 360 last Christmas and, luckily, also bought an extended warranty. Glad I did. 3-4 months later it started freezing up after being played for about an hour, and about a month afer that, developed green lines. Don't know what that's all about! Luckily with the extended warranty my son will be able to get a replacement game system, but it won't be an Xbox 360."
1,What a waste.,"Will admit that I have been a long time fan of the ps. I purchased a 360 about a month ago because I kept hearing how good the system is and how great the games play and I just got tired of waiting for some of the premium ps3 games to come out. Rented some games and they played great. I could definitely understand why folks are fans of the system and I was on the edge of becoming a convert, until....I got the rings of death. You can say I was not happy and had some choice words. Talked to the MS customer service (which was not very fun at all) and they offered to send me a box to ship it out and I declined it because I did not want to deal with the reliability issues of the system. I ended up taking it back to the store for a refund. I will stick w my ps3 that I have not had any problems with at all. I may pick up another 360 later down the road when MS fixes whatever problems the current system has."
3,"Love the system, but has got quality issues","I bought a XBOX 360 Bundle from COSTCO a month ago(Dec 2006). My four year old son and I loved the system. Our favorite game is Table Tennis by Rockstar Games. He was able to play well against me. But unfortunately, the system stopped working. It showed 3 red flashing lights and wouldn't start. I called Microsoft, they asked me disconnect cables, hard disk etc the reconnect and try again. But that wouldn't help. They asked me to send XBOX 360 for repair. Since I got it from COSTCO, I intend to return it and get a new one."
2,What undeserved hype!!!!,"A little prelude to my review. One of my neighbors is a game developer who works for a company that makes games for the Xbox, Xbox 360 and MSN network (mostly downloadable content). He told me that his company currently has 4 Xbox 360s and he warned that I should wait until all the bugs are ironed out before I buy one myself.Ok, now onto my review. I don't understand why people would buy this system at this moment. There are no must play game for the 360 and that's the bottom line. Also, one of the reasons why you can't find one is that people are buying these things to solely to sell, thus creating an entirely new class of middlemen who you can find on ebay and craigslist. This in turn makes the people who are forking over $400 to get this system actually believe that they are getting a great ""bargain"" when compared to what people are paying on ebay.Trust me folks. Just wait 'til spring when some more games come out or wait for the PS3. You really aren't missing much."
4,Powerful gaming system,"I actually just got this system recently so I wouldn't know about all the problems that many are having with overheating and other issues. However I have quite a number of friends who own the xbox 360. Two of my friends had their xbox360 break post 2005. Coincidentally both of them had their xbox set up vertically. Correct me if I'm wrong but aren't those holes on the side to vent the air so the xbox360 keeps cool? If you set it up vertically doesn't that block air from getting in and out? Just a thought.But the system itself is really awesome. I own a 40"" Sony Bravia LCD TV and the graphics are mind blowing. I only have two games now since I just purchased my system. Gears of War and Madden 2007, both are truly amazing. You need a HDTV to fully enjoy everything that this system offers. Perhaps the PS3 is more advanced technologically wise, but graphic wise the two are very close after having demoed the PS3 at a toys r us in NYC."
1,Run Away! X-Box Sux,"I bought one. Five minutes into every game, it freezes. Says the disc needs cleaning. So, I replace my game. Same thing happens. So, I send it back to Microsoft. They send me a brand new console. Guess what? My disc still needed cleaning. You will want to throw this thing out the window. I'm doing so with mine. A PSP 3 is looking mighty good..."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Don't waste your money on this product by Microsoft. It would be an awesome product if Microsoft wasn't involved in the hard drive and production. Their computers are borderline but their gaming systems are substandard.I should have invested in anything Playstation makes since I've have my original playstation and playstation 2 with no problems whatsoever. However after 5 months of owning the X-Box 360 the hard drive crashed and after talking to someone in India, I realized I have a paperweight on my hands.Needless to say, they do burn real nice and give off alot of magnificent flames, that's about the only thing good I can say about the Microsoft product X-Box 360.Stay with Sony or get a Wii, but please don't invest in an X-Box 360. If you do send me the money and you will get exactly what Microsoft offers, nothing but headaches.Hope this helps."
2,Hardware Disappointment,I bought an Xbox 360 in October and after playing it for two weeks it crashed. I got the one red light flashing. I called Microsoft and they told me to return it. I did and although I am living in the Caribbean and it cost me 200USD which is half the cost of the system I did that because I really believed in Xbox. I had a Generation 1 xbox before and had no problems. The system came back after 2 months and I was so excited I stayed home from work and went to pick it up. I brought it home and plugged it in only to see the same problem. I was disappointed and microsoft told me to bring it back in. I refused because it is costing me too much. They cannot understand that. The system is very unstable and overheats fast. Although the games are good but that is about all. I am going PS3 now and I will also write a review in one month about that.
2,Ok system; not fantastic,"the xbox 360 is an ok system. but it breaks down quite a bit (overheating). overall, its sort of a waste of money because it doesn't last long.why would ms put out a shoddy product that they're going to have to fix anyway? I would wait until the price dropped to spend money on this piece of junk."
2,So when is the REAL next-gen system coming out?,"the graphics on the x360 are not that much better than the first xbox. save your money for a playstation 3, because the graphics are going to be WAY better. so much better infact that it would be like comparing the very first gameboy to the gameboy advance. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! my work here is done. :-)"
1,Buyer Beware XBox 360 has tons of problems - Do your Research prior to purchase,"5 months ago we bought the new Xbox360, we should have waited a few more months to read the more recent reviews. With that said, the Xbox 360 has a 50 percent failure rate. The one that we purchased has failed and is being returned to Micrososft for repair. The turnaround time on the repair is 3 to 4 weeks. Apparently, the fact that the XBox 360 breaks down is a common ailment and one that Microsoft neither apoligizes for nor determines it a necessary candiadate for either refund or replacement. I recently visited the Circuit City website and read over 100 reviews of this product. 70 percent of which were highly critical of the product, labeling it as either a ""waste of money"" or a ""poor qulaity product."" With that said, we purchased a PS3 and will be selling the XBox 360 on Ebay."
5,"Quick shipping, horrible condition","It came faster then i expected, but the box it was in was very beat up, and had no padding or anything to keep my Xbox 360 from banging around. Very unimpressed with the shipping and will probably not order from Amazon again."
1,Come on people!,This is idiotic selling a system for so high a price. So it is sold out in stores just wait it out you'll get one and probably cheaper than store price now. These second hand sellers are crooks selling them so high. Think about priorities before paying these sellers such an idiotic price.
1,Product and custumer support is horriable,The system was cool until it overheated and destroyed my games. I called custumer support (aka India). They offered no help at all and claimed that it was my fault. They have the worst support in the world and they can barely speak english. I did not move or touch the Xbox 360 at all when I was playing it. This is not an isloated problem the same thing happend to my friend down the steet and countless others. Eventually you can argue with them to fix your Xbox but they will not replace the game that it burns. They make you pay for shipping to their repair shop which takes 2 weeks. I would not buy one or at least wait until they fix the fatal design flaws in the system. Right now I have a $400 paper weight.
1,Lack of Quality Control doesn't justify 400 bucks,"Long story short, bought my first one in July and my 9th, yes, 9th xbox 360 died last week due to bricking after a pushed update from Microsoft.Save your money, time, and blood pressure if you haven't bought one yet. Microsoft gives NO support other than taking your newer broken system and replacing it with an older repaired system, pushing updates that render the system worthless (as if it had value before). Purchase the cheapest BluRay player you can get.... PS3.I know I'm throwing my 1800 dollars in XBOX 360 consoles, games, and other garbage where it belongs."
1,Same Lens error from original Xbox console,"After no more than two month of use, this console can't read Games from Xbox or Xbox 360, not even DVD's. This happens to mee also in the first console XBOX generation. Why are this people using so very low quality parts????"
3,Xbox 360 SUXX,"This system is terrible. Finally after months and months of waiting, lucky finally went my way and i found an xbox 360. I have a 55 inch HD tv in my family room and i was so excited to test out the brand new system on that massive TV. Things went great for the first 5 days when i had only one game COD2. Then i was like i need another game and i picked up NBA 2k6 because i love sport games and it was only 49.99$. The second day i had the game, guess what it froze. Im like thats not a problem. Play it 2 hrs later turn it on 2 min into the game it freezes again. Now thats a problem. Luckily i return it for a new game and see if it was just hte game and nope the same thing happened. I have just sent it back to microsoft to get repaired and they better do a damn good job because im pissed off and i specifically said to include a complimentary game becasue of the all thte trouble they are causing everyone. TO be honest save your money now, this system sux."
2,Xbox 360 Prices,"When the Xbox 360 came out, I think it costs around $400. The Xbox 360 is way overpriced, and I think Microsoft did a bad thing in releasing a bunch of defective Xbox 360s. The price is outrageous, and, according to a freind of mine, has very little internal memory and requires a memory card to play games (Oblivion, for example) the way they were designed to play. Plus, $60 a game is laughable."
3,Does Not Play Home Made DVDs,"I like Xbox gaming system. I also like their HD DVD add on. However, to my horror, it won't play DVDs which I recorded. I may have to switch to PS3 if it plays home recorded DVDs."
1,360 Days (if lucky) of defect free operation.,"The 360 has a great library of games. But the hardware is mediocre at best! I've went thru two 360's that died within months of light usage. I decided to take the lost (in games purchased) and go with the king of hardware Sony's PS3. And while there aren't any games at this time (AAA games that is) there soon will be. So it's either ""jump in"" now and get a 360 and suffer the consequences of having to deal with a highly defective unit. Or get a PS3 with its reliable hardware and HD movie player and you can count on hardware that will truly ""Play beyond""."
3,Another SEGA Dreamcast?,"It seems this system was released too soon... Microsoft is trying to cash in on the holiday spending instead of having further development. Although, it looks awesome but so did the sega dreamcast when it came out only to take a pounding by the ps2. Buyer beware: Sony will be comin' guns blazin... Will Halo3 be Microsoft's savior? Time will tell, and hopefully we all will have a quality system instead of one packed in a box in our closet."
3,MAYBE THE NEXT DREAMCAST,"we all know what happend to the dreamcasrt back in 2002. The dreamcast failed because it came to early for its own good and did not expect the power of ps2,gamecube,and xbox. I THINK WEHEN PS3 AND REVOLUTION COME OUT MICROSOFT WISH THE HAVE WAITED INSTEAD OF RUSHING. FACE IT MICROSOFT YOU RUSHED BUT 360 IS STILL TIGHT"
1,disappointed,"No where does the description say that you can't play xbox games on this machine. If you hope to play regular xbox games- forget it. The website says it will play the most popular ones- it doesn't. I would not have purchased this system if this had been made clear. Do yourself a favor and buy a different game system. I will when I return this system. If I wanted to buy all new games, I might as well get the Nintendo wi"
1,Terrible,This is the biggest piece of junk I've seen lately. Got it home and it wouldn't work. Called the help line and didn't receive any help.
3,A rip off,i tried to get an Xbox 360 from best buy on the 18th. they promised they wouldnt sell any of them before the 18th. people were outside waiting on the 17th(not me)and it was about to rain so the people at best buy decided to sell them that day i was so mad. dont trust best buy to get a 360. to me the 360 isn't worth the trouble i've played the games and yeah they're really good but not next-gen good. i say wait a few extra months and see how the PS3 and Nintendo revolution turn out
1,360's aren't stable,"My opinion of the Xbox 360 would be better had M$ not have rushed this out into the market, without thorough testing.It's clear that they didn't test enough, because I know a guy who had to replace his 360 8 times due to the ""infamous"" RROD.This will be my first and last 360 I buy, as I got the RROD, along with an E 79 error.It's sad when you pay the amount you do for the system, only for it to go bad in less than a year of ownership. My old xbox is still running just perfect, yet the 360 is trash as compared to the old xbox.Shame on M$ for unloading such an inferior gaming console to the masses. So Nintendo Wii or PS3 here I come."
1,"RUBBISH, FAGILE, OVERHEAT, STAY AWAY IF YOU VALUE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!","This piece of rubbish breaks down a few times before the first year of use, the average life of the XBOX 360 is 7 months, sad but true some of the games make me buy this thing but in the end is not worth it to pay $400 for a console the does not work most the time, and the overheat is the worst of the worst the 3 red lights of dead as some people call it"
4,Fabulous,"The Xbox 360 console is a great machine and in it's current rendition has fixed many of the freezing / cooling issues it's had. The graphics and gameplay in the games of played so far are stunning, and the PS3 games, as of this review, don't look any better, and the 5.1 surround on this system is awesome through my digital surround reviever. Downside is still a lack of support for my favorite original Xbox titles, and the inability to easily transport your old xbox save games. Other than that I love it, I also use it as my Windows Media Center extender to watch my stored video's, pictures and TV from my Media Center PC through my Television downstairs."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"After the research I have done on this console I guess I should consider myself lucky that mine lasted a year. I read that they had extended the warranty to 3 years, but it turns out that is only for the ""Red Ring of Death"". Turns out I had one of the million other problems this console is experiencing. That means you have to send the broken console to them and pay them $100 to fix it. Microsoft says their console failure rate is 5%. An independent study found it to be 33%. I don't know anyone who owns one that hasn't had to send it off for repairs. When I called customer service, he knew exactly what was wrong with mine. So they obviously have more reoccuring problems than the ""Red Ring of Death"" but won't admit it. The console is very nice when it works. The thing is that I know several people with P3's and not one of them has sent one off for repair."
3,Flashing Red Light of DEATH!!!,"Other than the flashing red light of death, which has affected every xbox 360 that i know, it is a really fun system.Whats not so fun is calling the 1-800 number and waiting for them to send you a coffin for your $400+ system. The flashing red lights means that there is something terribly wrong with the hardware in the 360.I have had my xbox for almost a year and it was fine until now. Since this is a BIG problem, Microsoft has extended the warranty to three years from date of purchase on all affected 360s, which means i don't have to pay for my repair fee.My suggestion, go ahead and buy one if you want to have fun, but keep the receipt and all the papers that the 360 comes with. You may need them later.-j"
4,360 and Wii,"I have both the 360 and the Wii... If you are a hardcore gamer then a 360 is a must have. Gears of War is worth the purchase of a 360 alone. If you are looking for a console that the whole family will enjoy, then I suggest the Wii because it has more party oriented games. 360 is definitely worth every penny, and Microsoft isn't trying to rip you off like Sony."
4,Xbox 360 is the one for grownups,"The reason we all buy these righteously fun machines is because of the amount and types of ridiculously unawarely timestealing fun games they bring forth. Xbox 360 while having a good deal of the same games as the competition, usually has theirs out first and some looking and playing better. But the thing that sets them apart is their exclusive games as Halo 3, Gears of War, and Ninja Gaiden 2 which will be coming out next year as well as all the incredible things that are available on Xbox live from game you can play while talking to your best friends across the world, downloading new games or even movies and tv shows and more to come. This is your machine for digital entertainment as I have not even covered it all. My hands are twitching, time for some bioshock."
1,Xbox 360,"This product has some fun games but what's the use if your system keeps breaking down and needs to be sent to Microsoft for repairs over and over. It is very frustrating to see money spent on a $300+ product that needs constant repairs, and is away for months on end. Very disappointing! Maybe there should be a recall on all defective machine!"
3,This is a Micro-Catastrophe waiting to happen.,"So many awesome games, GOW, Quake4 to name just a few.. XBox LIVE is a breeze to use and there's alot of free content that can be downloaded in Hi Def. Plus there are alot of excellent peripherals that can be swapped with PCs. The only downside is the hardware side. Discs can be scratched far to easily and the disc drive is a major weak link. I have had this console for over a year and have had to RMA it 3 times. However the warranty offered is full and comprehensive so the cost to me has been small. My suggestion to those interested in buying is simple; wait until the next incarnation, if there is one."
4,Great Game System,This is a great system for game play. All the games so far have had amazing graphics. My only complaint is that the system heats up too quickly. You must have a very well ventilated space for it. We had to replace the hard-drive due to this problem. It's nice in that I can access my computer's microsoft media center using the 360 console which also gives access to other media products.
3,dissapointed,i had to send the first 360 back because of it freezing up and they were excellent at sending another so fast but we are now having problems with this one and am going to have to send it back and if it keeps happening we are going to get a refund.
2,As a mom....,"Got my teen two systems this year. The Wii for the holidays and 3 months later an Xbox 360 for his birthday. We made a deal, he traded in his PS2 and Gamecube with a ton of games got a $250 credit and put it toward the 360.Bought Oblivion, MLB 2K7 and GTA Triple pack (not for 360)He hates the 360. It doesnt support the regular xbox games. He had a failure on the hard drive within a month of play. Microsoft support was terrible. Finally threatened them and they let me return hard drive only to wait a month to get replacement. System overheats even with cooling fan after 3 hours of play.He has the Wii for a longer time and absolutely no problems at all. I understand the two systems are different but come one when you spend $500 on a console you should expect to have it for a while.If you're a mom beware you child will have meltdowns from this system."
1,Had to Send XBOX Back,"I received the console and when I plugged it in the hard drive worked b/c it brought me to the start up screen, however it did not read any games, dvds and or music cd's. The controller that also came with it damaged. The Left thumb stick did not sit directly in the middle, almost as if the spring was broken.I have contacted Amazon and they are sending me a replacement for all the items inside the box. Pretty dissapointed in this up to now. Hopefully the new one will not have the same problems."
1,Failure Waiting to Happen,"This is a nice system when it works. I've had mine for just a little over 3 months, and it is now dead. Not completelty dead, but you can only use it for less than 5 minutes before the screen freezes. When I called support about it, I learned that the warranty is only 90 days, and it would cost $130 to have it repaired. I would've thought that a system that goes for about $400 would have had a 1-year warranty. I guess Microsoft must have hired some top-notch reliability engineers, so they would know exactly how long to make the warranty period, so as not to eat into the profit margins too much."
4,Treasonous Doings During King Edward I of England.,"Espionage is not a new game. It has been occurring for centuries. This book outlines the historical treason of a trusted citizen of King Edward I. The book is based on historical fact. In it we see Hugh Corbett and his squire Ranulf on the trail of a traitor. Someone very close to the king has been informing the French King Philip of everything that has been going on in court. It's a dangerous mission for Hugh, and we see him in France and Wales and back to France again while he chases this elusive prey. This series by P.C. Doherty is a very interesting one. Each book is based on well-known historical fact, and Doherty weaves his fictional characters seamlessly into the tale. I recommend this series highly for those interested in English history, and for those who like a good historical thriller."
1,I've seen high school papers better written than this,"I guess anyone can write a book nowadays and try to sell it on Amazon.By reading the preview pages available on Amazon, two questions come to mind:How old is the author? (I'm guessing teens to early twenties)How much real life experience in managing companies does the author have?In fairness, I didn't buy this book (thank goodness!), but if the rest of the book is anything like the pages available here for preview, I'm glad I didn't."
4,Worth Reading If You Are A Fan,"I read a lot of autobiographies.This one stands out for the way it was written. She writes it in a very easy style to read. Like she is just sitting down and telling you a fun story. She includes a lot of personal feelings, and her little stories about things that happened in both her personal life, and in all her many career endeavors.There are a few down sides to this book. There is a lot of religious and Bible talk. She is very devout in her faith, and seems to be trying to convert the reader. Also, there is not much insight here on her part. She does not do any self reflection. She seems to think quite a lot of herself, and wants the reader to realize her importance too. There are not very many photos either.All in all, a good book to read if you are already a big fan of Ginger. But, if not, you should probably skip it."
4,Ginger Rogers paperback,The book was in good shape for a used book and arrived timely. I would use this seller again.
5,love being an insider,I totally enjoy reading Ginger's words and being on the inside of her history. Imagine hearing her thoughts about meeting and dancing with Fred and so much more. I am just at the point where her career is really taking off and cannot wait to continue.
4,Ginger,What an interesting life. The attachment to her mother (Ginger`s lifetime friend and mentor) was incredible. A good book and above average as a autobiography.
4,Ginger Rogers Life,"This is a great book telling the details of Ginger's life, her successful life, loves and Christian outlook. There is a lot more to her character than what we have seen on the screen. Sounds like she had a fun and fulfilling life. Well written book."
3,What an Ego!,"I love the Ginger Rogers-Fred Astaire movies, so I expected to love this book! The info is good, but the tone got old very fast. It seems that the biggest fan of Ginger Rogers is Ginger Rogers herself. And while I'm sure a big ego is mandatory for an entertainer, it makes this book a bit tedious."
2,Oh So Tedious!,"I was a huge fan of Ginger Rogers until I read this book--oy vey, what a moaner! She comes across as thoroughly tedious and completely self-involved. I can fully understand exactly why she had so many husbands. I truly sympathized with one of the later husbands who had to resort to hiding booze up in the loft of their house--anything to numb the pain, I suspect!"
4,Ginger Rogers review,I havn't got to read the book yet but from the looks of it I'm sure I'm gonna like it.
4,Realistic view of a fantasy world,"Pleasantly surprised to read Ginger Rogers autobiography about the golden age of Hollywood. She writes about her troubles with the hollywood biggies ( director Mark Sandrich...) and the price she paid for having not conformed to the hollywood social scene of drinking, philandering and ego stroking. Loved to read about her early broadway career and her romantic tangles ranging from Jack Culpepper to Cary Grant. There are times when she is not specific about certain events ( her later marriages) but does not make any apologies. Obviously this talented lady was a force to be dealth with seriously, or she would not have survived the harsh realities of show business. Much has been written about her mother Lela, and not in very sympathetic tones, but none of that in this autobiography- love, support and tenacity are what got these women through- a very entertaining book."
3,INTERESTING,"Frady definately has the usual liberal anti-Wallace attitude, but he has a lively writing style and, at times, does give credit to some Wallace's populist accomplishments."
4,Frady is an excellent writer,"Has some wonderful passages, especially on Wallace's youth. Frady's biography of Billy Graham is also top-notch. He is a superb prose stylist who can evoke a setting and an age masterfully."
2,Told Before,"I've never given a book less than three stars. I just wanted to point that out and make that clear.One of the ladies in our book club brought ""The Hottest Summer Ever Known"" to the table. I saw the book - read the title - then thought about ""The Coldest Winter Ever"".The Hottest Summer Ever Known lacks originality and to be rather honest plagiarizes ""The Coldest Winter Ever"" in more ways than one could imagine.In spite of the copycat title and storyline, I must say that it conveys a message that should be ignored by no one. AIDS is real! AIDS DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE! AIDS ATTACKS THE BLACK COMMUNITY HARD! AIDS KILLS! So, rap it up and be safe.Ms. Williams, I would like to see you try again. You're an author with a conscious mind, which is good. You're used as a tool from God to get your point across to everyone. I love that about you and your book. My only advice would be to be original in the process. Best of luck to you.RolandaNothing BUT Page Turners Book Club"
4,A great effort for a first time author.,"This is a page turner! From the first chapter to the last, you won't put it down until you're done. The author tells a great story full of excitement and suspense, while enlightening the reader to the real threat of HIV/AIDS and how it's being spread in the community. It's believable, it's funny, it's sad, and it's a good read."
2,Some Summer's need a cool breeze! 2.5,"A tale of 2 sisters..1-Good intentions gone bad the other sister-It's all about me due to the fact I have hidden issues! Life started out ruff for these two and is bumpy along the way. It's a so-so read No need to rush out and get this one,I must admit the tittle is what drew me to it. If you like giving knew author's a try why not this one? My advice is that you go to the Library or borrow."
5,Great Summer!!!!,"This was an excellent book and very well written. I highly recommend this book to all readers who loves the genre of reading. It keeps you turning from page to page with anticipation of what is going to happen next. Although it started off slow, it suddenly turn to action drama fill read. I love the ending, I guess blood is thicker than water."
4,Never Trust a Big Butt and a Smile,"Summer is irresistible and can have any man she wants. With her banging body and her sister girl personality, Summer is taking revenge. Due to the heart-wrenching death of her mother, Summer turns her back on the only family she has.Grams, is tired of the disappointments but knows that Summer has a good heart somewhere under there.Aunt Kim is so into her own disappointments at home that she doesn't have time for a disrespectful child.Treasurer loves her sister to no end, but cannot break the wall that has been up since the diagnosis of their mother.After Summer meets a prominent doctor, while dealing with her own issues, her life spirals out of control. Hopefully, the one's that she has turned her back on will save her from the destruction she has caused."
5,ASTONISHING!!,"This book was absolutely awesome!!! I could NOT put it down. It was suggested and selected, by our book club 'Sista's In Books' and we actually reside here in Detroit. I know we will have a LOT to discuss at our monthly meeting. If you want a book full of drama and suspense, I recommend The Hottest Summer Ever Known. You will NOT be disappointed. Great job Ms. Valencia Williams!!!By the way, my husband was upset because I could'nt turn the nite-lite out and read until 5 a.m. one night. LOL!!!"
1,Horrible Read!!,"I hated this book from moment I started the first page. Ms. Williams' characters are one-dimensional and the whole story reads like a week's worth of Jerry Springer episodes. I understand that Ms. Williams believes this book to be a cautionary tale about sex and relationships, but it is not successful in the least bit. There are also many errors in word usage and several forms of punctuation are used improperly throughout the book.There is no ""word craft"" to this story -- no metaphors, descriptive language, turn of phrase, anything to make this book a piece of prose or literature. It is just a raunchy tale of sex, deception, and stereotypes with characters that have no redeeming qualities. I tried to get into this book because Ms. Williams is a fellow Detroiter who did have the guts and tenacity to see her book through to the published stage, however, I cannot recommend this book to anyone."
3,Was just ok,"I thought this book was going to be good,but it was just okay.I guess people got different views on what they consider a good book. The book had to many unnecessary details,I had to keep skipping through the book to get to the juicy stuff. I liked the fact that brought up the issue of HIV."
3,Medium,"I bought this brush in order to make my dog feel better.He didn't like the other brushes I had.I have RA Big Time,this brush allows Buddy&I; tolaydown on carpet&just; brush.He doesn't whimper w/this one.The old wire brush pulled the hair and HURT him.This brush is soft&pliable.We; enjoy the grooming now."
4,"If you can find it, get it","I read this as part of my book club. We were to pick an autobiography of a musician or band. Great book about how Dolly got her start. Reading about her childhood really makes you appreciate what all she has accomplished. She is a positive person and it's always good to hear from someone with a good outlook on life. You don't get a lot of the dirt, but who needs it? I hope she writes more down the road about how the rest of her life is going since this book was published."
5,Magpie,"The book was in very good condition, better than i expected it to be. It arrived arrived in time for me to use as part of a Christmas gift for a friend that is really enjoying reading the book."
2,Dolly a Disappointment!,"Shucks, I was hopin' for so much more. This book is just too sanitary for me. This gal has been around and seen a lot more than she talks about, and I am not talkin' jest sex here. This woman has more talent than half of Hollywood put together. She is a hurricane, but she comes off like a mouse in this tome. She is the most beautiful woman in the world over 50, I am sure of it, both inside and out. I'll wait 'til she's 80 and writes her REAL memoirs. Dolly, you have the greatest lips in the world."
5,Dolly: My Life and Other Unfinished Business,"A very good book. Dolly is quite the interesting gal. I lived a very similar life as a child so I could sure relate to her. I love her down home ways, no matter how much money she makes. It's hard to lay the book down when you start reading it. I read until 4 in the morning because I couldn't find a stopping place."
5,Loved it,"I enjoyed this book so much, and I am glad to get the chance to know Dolly better. I have always loved her as a person and an entertainer. This is a touching, funny book about her roots and childhood in the Smokies to the days of Porter Wagoner, her marriage to Carl, the movies she made and the ups and downs of her life. Funny, crazy situations she has gotten herself in to. She is very candid, honest and humble. She gives some very good advice, and I have taken most of it. She is a smart lady. She is a caring, loving, spiritual person, and I am happy I got the chance to read her book. In a way, it has changed my life."
3,HP Inkjet Refills,"Better than the last one I tried. Be sure to wear gloves. Also, be sure the fill hole is very dry before attempting to adhere ""dot"", or it won't stick. Some ink will drip from print head for about 2 minutes, have a cup or lint-free towel ready."
4,A Needed Call to Discipleship,"Walter Chantry has done an excellent service to the church community. In a culture of lazy, self-serving spirituality, Chantry writes about the cost of discipleship. He gives no easy solution, no quick-fixes and no gimmicks; all that he lays before us is the cross of Christ and the words of our Lord to come follow Him. Although discipleship costs us everything, Chantry reminds us of the joy of this sacrifice. This book is a must read for those who are serious about their relationship with Christ and want to follow the difficult yet sweet road of communion with the Lord Jesus Christ."
4,variety of mixes featuring the singer from Wolfsheim,"I thought I recognized the male voice as soon as I began playing this single, and I had to look Heppner up to see if he was of Wolfsheim. The Humate mix works best with his voice. It's moody, trancy, dark house. The Felipe Inoa mix is minimlastic house with a middle eastern sound. Marco Zappala's mix is funk house. Mellow Traxk mis is dark and hard I(like this mix). Sono's Ghost mix is clunky house. the Splashfunk mix is hard and energetic, another good mix. Funky Junction mix is funky and trancey at the same time. Chill out version is mostly synth and vocal. Pretty good variety of mixes if you like male vocal house."
3,"Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby blue.","Ms. Kortes' voice isn't all that, nor is this performance some wondrous revelation into a different Dylanesque dimension. But for those of us who are smitten with Dylan's original compositions on ""Blood on the Tracks"", these songs could be performed by Roseanne Barr and still be worth three stars. (Well, maybe not Roseanne Barr -- but definitely Roseanne Rosannadanna.) Props to Mary Lee's Corvette for paying homage to one of the greatest albums of the 70s with straightforward aplomb. Ultimately, though, this is a pleasant novelty worth a listen or two, nothing more."
4,An Unexpected Delight,"This is nothing more and nothing less than a soundboard recording of a one-time only NYC club show in which Mary Lee's Corvette performed ""Blood on the Tracks"" in its entirety.The album won't, in fact, change Western Civilization as we know it (but neither will any other album released this year or the next or the next or the next). What the album does do is capture a show in which the great songs on ""Blood on the Tracks"" are brought to life with a tight band, simple arrangements and a compelling lead singer. What could be better than that? Not much really.A marvelous listening experience that, in my judgment, holds up to repeated plays."
1,tribute or mimicry?,"There's no point in slavishly mimicking every note in the original. Dylan did it already, and in every concert today, he does it differently; his reinventions are often surprising and even shocking. None of that in this respectful album.For good tributes, see the 'This ain't no tribute' series, e.g. Taj Mahal's version of ""It takes a lot to laugh..."". But Mary Lee ain't no Taj Mahal. And she certainly ain't no Big Bob."
3,Not Terrible...Not Great,"I love Donald Byrd's output in the 1970's. From ""Black Byrd"" through ""Places and Spaces"" he was consistent in delivering compelling crossover music that jazz purists detested. There seems to be a departure on Caricatures from the blaxploitation influence of the aforementioned albums. This CD has an obvious disco influence that makes it seem a little contrived and cheesy at times. I realize that from the mid to late 70's disco had an effect on all genres of music (Kiss-""I was made for loving you"", Rolling Stones-""Miss You""..to name a few) but the influence here just doesn't seem to work. The vocals on the album are a little too forced and don't sound free and airy like the vocals on earlier efforts. I can understand why this hasn't been released on CD sooner. If you are a huge Donald Byrd fan - buy it..you may enjoy it. If you are looking for a starting point in his 70's Blue Note output - go with Black Byrd."
5,Old School Jazz,"I originally bought this album when I was 16. The music took me away then.And still does. If you like sunset walks along the beach, or cruising through darken city streets. This is a great album to muse to.-m"
2,"allis chalmers tractors,enthusiast color series","brief narrative,uses same picture over and over,would not reccomend!!!"
2,Allis-Chalmers Tractors,"I was a bit disappointed in this book. It would seem that these guys had an old A-C day on a farm, then got a camera and decided to take pictures and make a book. There are alot of colorful pictures of reconditioned tractors, but I was looking for a more data based and historical account of A-C."
1,Do not bother,"The earpiece was very flimsy, and did not stay on your ear very well. It always felt like it was about to fall off. I returned it for a headset that had the clamp on top of your head."
2,"Good design, poor volume","Bought this after my Plantronics headset broke (that had volume problems also anyway). With this headset, the person can hardly hear you and you must keep repeating yourself no matter how close your mouth is to the headset (unless its touching of course). By the way, I used it with a Panasonic phone and it was a recommended headset on Panasonic's website. Waste of money."
4,Fairly Pleased,I have purchased three of these over the last couple years and may be getting another today. I have found that the cable gets worn out in time. Works great in the beginning and my listeners have been satisfied yet as time goes on and I use it more it eventually becomes sensitive in the cable. I have an older one that I can't move when using it and have to be sure the cable is not dangling or my listener will hear me cutting out. I keep purchasing it because I have yet to find on that is nice and light like this one and easy slip over the ear.
2,techno i hate techno!!,I thought razed in black would be on this cd with music like razed inblack like dark industrial music but its just tehcno. I dont like it!
2,HAPPY MUSIC FOR HAPPY PEOPLE,"IF YOUR INTO DARK EBM/INDUSTRIAL DANCE MUSIC THAN THIS ALBUM SUCKS, BUT IF YOUR INTO HAPPY EBM/INDSTRIAL/TECHNO DANCY MUSIC THAN THIS ALBUM IS FOR YOU ! I LIKE MY EBM TO BE DARK AND SINISTER. THIS COMPLIATION IS MORE ON THE TECHO SIDE !"
5,Great Gift,"There are very few baby items from the NFL. This was a great gift for a newborn, GO EAGLES!"
3,All of Warnock's books are free,"The kindle edition is for sale here foor $5.00 the paperback is for sakle here for $29.00? How can this be when Warnock has in the introduction to ALL of his books, that they are free? And free on purpose."
1,Mine was damaged as well.,"Got mine today, and yes there was damage. The 3D pop up was ripped, and 3 disks were out of the pockets, all 3 had scratches, one real bad. The 2 that stayed in the pockets were ok. One folded ticket, the book cover has mars.Does anyone know how to contact Universal directly? I looked through their web site, and there is no way to contact any type of customer service.The music great, of course.However, the DTS layer on the DVD is only 48/16. How lame! They couldn't do it in 96/24? LAME! You can defintely hear the difference!"
3,this is sad,I received my package yesterday. Three of the cd's were not in the tray and one has a minor scratch. I'm not about to send it back for one that could be in worse condition. The dvd had a little glue on the edge. I was able to clean that off and it played just fine. Everything else was ok. It's a sad day when I spend my hard earned money for something that is packaged so poorly.
4,"Very, very good","As I my only previous experience of Clapton was Disraeli Gears, expected power chord rock with screaming solos. When I heard Layla.., I obviously knew the title song was excellent but the rest of the album is also very strong. D&D play the blues so well. If you needed any reason to buy this CD, the reason lies with the first two tracks alone as these stand out. I couldn't believe how beautiful Bell Bottom Blues was. I can see how Counting Crows developed their sound. In short, a solid album and a good record of 70's rock/blues"
4,Can someone help me out...?,"I have one of the remasters from the 90's, which is what my ears were used to. Obviously, listening to this version was a bit different in terms of the mix, but it's certainly clearer.HOWEVER, my question concerns the song ""Keep on Growing""...at about 24 seconds in, there's a quick break where Clapton shouted ""Whoahhh!"" On this 40th anniversary edition, that shout is completely gone!Was that something ""edited in"" for the 90's master? Was it NOT on the original vinyl?Update: NEVERMIND...I answered my own question by breaking out the turntable + vinyl. It turns out the 90's version (which contained Eric's shout) was a ""remix"", including vocals, guitar bits, etc that the band had recorded but NOT included in the original release. This 40th anniversary edition is like the original vinyl release, albeit with better sound quality."
2,Over Rated,"Other than Layla, there isn't much of interest here, just more British white boy blues, I'd stick to the comps."
1,"Bummed out, buyer beware!!!","I was totally looking forward to this arriving, I was quickly disappointed when this arrived today and I opened the package. When I opened the box the contents were strewn all over. But the biggest bummer of all was being deceived that this included a custom Layla artwork Fender stratch plate/pick guard. It's not a pickguard at all, just a cheap sticker to place over the pick guard. LAME!!!!!!!"
4,When God decided to be human,"This album is a real snapshot in time. I think Eric was so tired of being ""God"" that he decided all he wanted to do was to be in a working band. Thus Derek and the Dominos were created. There's really no music like it, either. There are so many influences that it all becomes a melting pot of raw emotion and energy that defies description. Mr. Clapton dissolves himself in a sea of desperate vocals and cascading, battling guitar licks that are ever-present and unrelenting in their ferocity. It's many flaws give it timeless character and a uniqueness that will never be matched. The sound has a brittle edge that only helps to reinforce the urgency of the music."
3,Layla,"If you like this album you might consider buying it in the SACD format as I just did. On listening I think it is not particularly better than the CD version. I guess that different Hi Fi systems will playback SACDs differently (to some extent) and this needs to be taken into account. Some SACDs I have bought have been very much better than the CD version and a few have been outstandingly greater than the CD: this one was not one of those. I'm not talking about the music, but only about the recording quality; the 'sonics' as some people put it of the SACD version.SACDs generally, in my limited experience, sound much better than the CD version. This SACD is better than the CD version, but not by much."
4,I wish Clapton could've kept this up...,"Derek and the Dominoes is where Clapton's talent really shines. This CD is worthy of 4 stars most definatley. (I don't give 5 stars out that easily, and this album does not match my standards of 5 stars.)Standouts on this album are ""Layla"" and ""Bellbottom Blues."" Others include ""Why does love got to be so sad"" and ""Key to the Highway."" I wish Clapton would've kept this kind of guitar playing up, as opposed to going the direction of Pilgrim and Reptile. Oh well, I'll be listening to this until Clapton comes out with another real guitar album."
5,A proposed marriage from Eric Clapton...,"The classic album from the days when Eric Clapton proposed marriage to Pattie Boyd. All songs were for her, but she said NO! -and he got a very long down period with drugs, alcohol and many girls who tried to comfort him. You can sense on this album the great love he had for Pattie. He created great creativity. I highly recommend this album.Ole Nielsen / Denmark"
5,if you dont have it youre not a clapton fan!,simply the best love song with a taste of classic your money is in good investment in this album
5,I want to be buried with this album...,"Eric Clapton at his absolute zenith! I believe this to be the greatest record ever made...there isn't a bad tune on it and his supporting cast on this album were the best muscians playing at the time. The singing, songwriting, and music made Derek & the Dominos one of the tightest groups of all time. Anyone that knows anything about music will agree..."
3,Decent for its time..But gets old fast!,"Sure,most of Mr. Clapton's stuff is reasonably good, but really that's only when it's compared to the immediate competition. Truly, when one is a rather naive 17 year old, some of these tunes may not sound half bad! But with some musical and worldly experience, this album, like just about all ""Rock"", fades away into the realm of adolescent sentimentality,bordering on noisy nonsense. Indeed, listening to say ""Bell Bottom Blues"" for a wizened old timer (now over 50) is simply an embarrassment, and the idea of these performers playing them now is even worse. Same with just about everything here. And the copy cat version of ""Little Wing"", originally written/recorded by Eric's old rival, J. Hendrix, does not come close to the original! Really, the best Clapton can still be heard on the older (1967-68)""Cream"" albums, much of which still sounds fresh and unique, not just thumping re-treads of 3 chord blues with banal lyrics."
2,Layla,"Clapton's best moments were, undoubtfully, the ones he spent with Ginger and Jack. By then he had freshness and promissed to really change things for better in the music field. After that, all he did was just repetitive, full of keyboards and boring. Listen to what he did here with Little Wing and tell me sincerely: Don't u think he had potential to have done MUCH BETTER than that with this song?"
2,One of the most over-rated rock albums of all time,"Derek and the Dominoes were, of course, a one-album band for Eric Clapton and ""guest"" musicians. The title song and ""Bell Bottom Blues"" notwithstanding, the album is, in a word, B-O-R-I-N-G. While the virtuoso guitar soloing between Clapton and Allman may enthrall some, this album is guaranteed to otherwise put to sleep the vast majority of the listening public. This is definitely NOT an album to play while driving down the highway late at night. ZZZZZZZZZ....."
2,Overrated,"I have never been a Clapton fan, but I feel compelled to speak up here because this is one of the most truly overrated albums of all time. Take the title track - this would be decent guitar pop if it didn't have Eric's disgraceful vocals dumped on top of it.I don't really have a cohesive viewpoint to state. Just that this record stinks."
5,EC's Finest Moment,"A great example of chemistry & kinship being more efficient than the suprgroups he was involved in up to this point, this proved to be Clapton's pinnacle achievement as an artist.Take his soap opera situation, the band he surrounded himself with (Was there a better rock drummer than Jim Gordon around this time? Has there been a better collaborator for Clapton than Bobby Whitlock?), throw in Duane Allman, Tom Dowd producing, & what you have is a album with great songs, vocals... & yes, guitars.Clapton, whose music is marred at times with inconsistency, was at his BEST in the late 60's & early 70's, & this is the best example of him at his finest."
5,THIS IS THE GREATEST ROCK ALBUM OF ALL TIME,"I have never heard an album so pure and so beautiful... Every song sticks in your head like glue. You will never forget that piano solo at the end of ""Layla""- It's timeless!"
3,The original master recording is the way to go,"I still like this particular album, but, unfortunatly, the 20th anniversary edition copy that I had got dammaged. The quality was much better and it was the original master recording. So, I recomend that if you have the extra $$, but the original master recording and you'll enjoy it much better"
2,A disappointment,The SACD recording of Derek and the Domino's Layla is a disappointment to say the least. I have recently begun listening to several SACD and DVD-Audio recordings and this sound mix offers nothing new to the previous recordings. This is one of rock's best offerings and the sound on this SACD offers no improvement to the mix of Eric Clapton and Duane Allman's guitar work. A major letdown.
5,Clapton is God.,"This is a beautiful album - full of emotion, heartache, and angst, a rock album of this quality is a rarity in this day and age. Eric and Dwayne are rock legends, and you too will not be surprised after hearing this album. It's one of my top five albums of all time. Not to discredit Jimi Hendrix (the Master), Stevie Ray, or others whom have covered ""Little Wing"" in their time, but Derek & the Dominos version of this classic song on this album is glorious."
5,clapton-allman,clearly one of the best albums of all time. Allman deserves special recognition. Outstading guitar work.
5,Must have!,"This sensationally superb representation of forbidden love wraps it's arms around your soul. Clapton sings his sorrows screaming out in pain. The exchange of guitars spoke the language of sadness expressed throughout each song. This amazing, soulful album is a must in your music collection."
2,Glue on CDs,"My CDs/DVDs also had glue on them, ugh.What a mess.I am reviewing on this alone, don't really expect these kind of problems from a set that costs 100 bucks.Quality control leaves something to be desired."
1,Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs?,If you bought this before there is no need to buy this version and it is not near as good as the Sacd version!Please wait another 10 years they might it do as 50th Anniversary Super Duper Deluxe version? Only time will tell
2,great music. Horrible packaging,"I would like to get my hands on the 'orrible, 'orrible lit-tle man who thought up the packaging for this album. Two of the CDs were scratched on receipt because of the way they were stuffed in the cardboard pockets in the set. i managed to clean them up by performing a CD wash using eye glasses cleaner but that's not the point. The packaging sucks. Recommendation; if you buy this set, go out and purchase 5 CD sleeves to store them. Other than that a great set. However, where is the ""video"" which is advertised. My DVD has only audio. Whoever kaboshed the design of such a monumental set should be fired. I gave it 2 stars because such great music can oversome even the odds presented here."
2,"Shame, shame, shame.","Well you heard most of it before, two discs loose in box and one hidden. However I was lucky, no scratches and no glue. What nobody mentioned was the packaging of the vinyl in paper sleeves. High quality vinyl in a high priced set deserves rice sleeves. That's where mine went instantly. I would also like to take Amazon to task as I purchased from them. I know they always state that discs may come loose during shipment in multiple disc sets. Well the box set is plastic wrapped to a piece of cardboard. This in turn was placed in a box three times larger and shipped. No other packing material. I am not a shipper by trade but I think common sense would tell you that the box set would slide all around loosely in the larger box. Mine came with a nice big ding in the box set. Guess I will have to live with this for fear of getting scratched or glued discs upon an exchange."
4,Layla,"Layla is another one of those must have albums for your collection if this is a genre of love for you. It, like Live At The Fillmore is made up of wonderfully composed and performed music. On this album however there is an added pleasure and that is Duane Allman on guitar. There is a lot of the same songs on this as is on Live AT The Fillmore but instead of being a live performance, Layla is a studio production and that is the only reason I gave this four out of five stars."
5,Renders 95% of my record collection to be redundant,"Many moons ago a jock buddy of mine lent me a cassette of this album-didn't care for it. Twelve years later, it's all I wanna listen to. Rippin' guitar, soulful playing, and oh, twangy as hell. This really puts the classic in classic rock. If you don't dig this, you are either an ignorant high school junior (as I was), or a hopeless fool who doesn't deserve your sense of hearing...I feel bad for deaf people, for they will never hear the majesty of this record. I never understood why Eddie Van Halen worshipped Clapton-now I do."
3,Is it Clapton at his best ?,"Well...a question best answered by others. I liked Clapton long before this LP and still like some of his work. As a piece of work this is not his best work, some tracks yes but mostly no. 461 Ocean Blvd. is better as a album. Eric Clapton is best served LIVE. Derek and the Dominos Live at the Fillmore, EC was Here,etc.... do youself a favor...go live or go home."
5,Simply the greatest album ever recorded.,"Unbelievable! Slap on some headphones and get ready for the ride of your life! This album is emotionally exhausting. Listen to it 5 times, each time concentrating on a different musician. The best ensemble ever put together. Great guitars, great bass, great drummer, great keys and backup vocals. Tremendous."
1,a disappointing remaster,"I bought the 2011 remaster of Layla based on the Amazon reviews, which suggested an improvement over the 20th Anniversary remix/remaster. I was sorely disappointed. Perhaps it is true that this remaster is closer in balance to the original album, but the sound quality is poor - and amazingly so. There is an audible high frequency hiss throughout the disc, most easily identifiable at the end and beginnings of tracks, which colors the entire production. Add the overall muddiness and low-end thump, and (believe me) you don't want to listen to this. I don't know which version of Layla on disc is best, but, for me, this isn't it. I'll stick with the more pristine sound of the 20th Anniversary edition - remix or not."
5,WWII-A Small Part-(but a good book),This book was very good read.I was a little surprised that there was not a lot of combat action seen by this WWII Marine but the story is very interesting.This man went about his duties and served his country with honor.He shares his thoughts in an open and honest fashion as though he was talking to one of his friends in a casual conversation. His style is as casual and open as I remember my own father's who served in WWII about the same time but who is now been gone for over 20 years. I just wish I had paid better attention in my know-it-all years prior to his death but this book gives me some insight into the thinking of an everyday guy that went to serve his country in one of it's most trying times-not really knowing what to expect when he got there-but dealing with the cards dealt him.I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it to anyone interested in military history.
1,Wrong image for discription,"Image is a 5-in. fruit plate of the Johnson Bros. ""Merry Christmes"" pattern, not ""Friendly Village""."
4,one time,I have only had one chance to use it and i like it. size is a bit much. the size on line could be in inches and that might make it a little easier to decide which to order.overall it works and can't wait to be able to use it more frequently
3,i wouldn't bother,"I found this book to be too out of date to be of any help. Like laws that have not kept up with the technology, this book is also incapable of dealing with the modern media. I'd suggest reading Guerrilla PR Wired by Michael Levine for a more up to date and relevant techniques."
5,"The ""Q"" Document (Book)","A fantastic book. I read the ""Q"" Document every few years because it's that good. I decided to finally buy my own copy."
2,Boring people and an inferior story,"This book was recommended to me by someone who loved it. The people in the story are boring. Who cares about a guy who ran away from home and is one-dimensional? Who cares about a broken down alcoholic woman who's a shadow of her potential and former self? I couldn't care about these characters. I could see that they acted stupidly. After reading 75% of the book, I didn't finish it. It was an inferior DaVinci Code. The religious and historical significance of the story was presented in a dull fashion rather than being fascinating like Da Vinci Code."
3,White Clover! Where are you???,"Why won't DG start making the White Clover wand again? I'd buy their whole supply. Okay, maybe not that much, but I'd sure be a steady customer. Sprinkled on clean linens, it was a transcendent experience. Sigh. Everybody, write Davies Gate and ask them to bring back the White Clover wand!!"
3,"OK, but product support is awful","Have had the thing for a year and a half. Works well for sure. Sailboat. Helm is 15 feet away from the radio mounted below. This unit solves the problem. Only beef I have was when I wanted to clarify some confusing info in manual re. charging of batteries. Was murder getting product support to pick up or call back or respond to email. FINALLY got them to do so and they told me unit is defective, send it in. When I sent it in they sent back saying unit fine, it just won't charge the way you want, in spite of manual saying the opposite. Wasted 2 months getting to the bottom of an issue that one intelligent person at the other end of a phone could have solved with 5 minutes of customer service."
5,Elusive!,"If you're like me, you've looked everywhere trying to find this 1/4 inch GearWrench, at one time they were fairly easy to find but, for some reason, they have become very elusive!I paid less for this wrench through Amazon than I did buying my original one off a SnapOn truck which, by the way no longer carries this wrench.Complete the set, buy the wrench! While you're at it, there are other sizes available through Amazon that are not found anywhere else.If you're as anal as I am, you gotta buy it, mix-matching wrenches is just cheesy! Buy them all!"
5,very cute!,"its such a cute toy.all the little accesories are really nice.and her clothes are pretty but some are sorta wierd.i dont really like a dyed pink in her hair,and also when you open the counter it doesn't open to wide and its annoying when u want to put her behind the counter.overall this toy is adorable!"
4,70s Thriller Classic That Skewers its Era,"The Stepford Wives is a great, slick piece of entertainment. Beautifully shot, carefully directed and well cast, this makes for some first-rate entertainment. Is it about feminisim? Chauvanism? The quest for perfection? Any and all really. Goldman did a great job scripting Levin's novel. It is mysterious, creepy, sometimes languid and it still manages a great number of tongue-in-cheek moments. Ultimately, it's not WHAT is happening to these women (how many clues and winks can they give you) rather it's about whether our heroine will succumb to the same fate. The final shot is the ultimate gasp and chuckle moment. Ross, O'Neal and Masterson are fine. Paula Prentiss is the perfect wiseass who keeps it in check just enough so that she herself does not become a joke. The film holds up well and the DVD looks great. A must see."
1,Most recent release - Very Grainy DVD - great movie,"I've loved this movie since seeing it on TV in the latter 70's. I also have the original DVD release which, sad to say, is far superior to this release.This release's video, though it's anamorphic widescreen, is very, very grainy. Viewed on a HD, big screen TV with a progressive scan DVD player, it's almost unwatchable. It's like watching it on analog broadcast TV from a distant station via an outdoor antenna during nearby thunderstorms - it's THAT BAD!Save your money, buy the original DVD if you can find it, or resort to VHS (gasp), but you'll be disappointed in this release. Too bad, because the extras are interesting."
2,well made but...,"If you have any inkling as to what this movies about your in for a long slow trip through seventies suburbia. I heard a rumor that Tim Burton is planning a remake (Hope its better than Planet of the Apes.) so I checked this flick out. I also heard that it's tense and scary, and it could be unless you figure out what indeed is going down in Stepford. And it's not too tough to guess believe me.This film is more like a really, really long episode of the Twilight Zone. It does have a decent payoff at the very end but it sure takes an awful long time getting there."
4,Classic 70s!,"Everytime Stepford Wives is on I have to watch, as it just makes me laugh. The dialogue is a panic, and Paula Prentiss, especially, is just great.Beyond that, it was probably scary the first time I saw it (I don't remember). Yes, the best horror/sci fi movies have a larger element of plausiblity than this one, but I recommend just relaxing and enjoying.Most fun and interesting is how this is such a classic product of the 70s - the hair, costumes, the whole theme and premise of the movie. If Ira Levin's novel were adapted into a movie today, it would bear little resemblance to the Stepford Wives as we know it today.Next time I am having the boys over and we are going to have a Stepford Wives party! (I'll just die if I don't get that recipe!)"
5,are you next?,"Joanna Eberhart has decided to get away from the chaos of the big city and moves with her husband and kids to the town of Stepford. at first, it seems like a perfect, quiet, and just to good to be true. everyone is friendly, the town has all the accomidations, and its family friendly. but theres something off about the town. for one thing, the wives are to...perfect, to bland, and just seem content with living in a kitchen. as Joanna meets another woman who suspects something odd, they begin to investigate but there investigation will lead to the towns most darkest secret and for Joanna, she will soon realize that in a matter of time...she's next. the original version is definently more close to Levin's novel were nothing is what it seems and the director keeps the film in a taut sense of dread. the actresses also bring exeptional performences and the ending is so shocking, it will leave people breathless. so if your looking for a frighting film, this is the one for you."
3,Could've Been Better,"This movie adaption of Levin's great book is only so-so. It's plot is original and intriguing, yet it could have been executed much more cleanly. I may be biased since I have just read the book, but I thought that the book was better, and I didn't like the parts where the movie strayed from the book, especially towards the end. Levin's ending left you wondering...did the men in Stepford really do what you think they did, or are you crazy too? The movie leaves no doubt, no mystery. Overall, I guess I would recommend it."
1,DVD of The Stepford Wives does not work in U.S. DVD players,I have bought this item (and returned it) from Borders and an online company. Neither DVD will work in my DVD player or any other machine it has been tried in. (Note: my DVD player has never before rejected any DVD.)This is obviously a flawed issue. I believe ALL of the DVDs are unworkable.Has anyone else purchased this item? Why is Amazon selling a product that does not work?
1,I agree with Chuckju,"I bought this title on-line from Amazon. It would not play. I returned it for another. Same problem. Apparently, according to customer reviews; those discs that do work are sub-standard anyway. For now, I'll stick with my widescreen VHS version - which looks damn good. I would like to have experienced those great extras though."
4,"after 20 years of suspense/horror movies, this is the best!","The most eerie feeling is knowing that this could be happening in today's world...For a horror movie from 1975, this one will definately keep you on the edge of your seat and make you wonder if it could really happen!"
3,It was better than I thought the original would be...,"I saw the re-make with Faith Hill, Nicole Kidman before seeing this version. But my thoughts were this: the original kept to one plot that Stepford was going to turn all of the wives into robots. I found myself beleiving the store in the original, the new one feels like they couldn't make up their minds, and it was too 'girl power' weirdness.It was nice to see Joanna and Bobbie really become friends. I felt in the new version the they weren't as good of friends so when she become's 'Stepford' it didn't matter. When I watched the original it was really horrible when Bobbie changed.Overall, I think that if you watch them both you will get a great movie alone.. I am really not sure which was better. Both had their faults. (Although - my husband will tell you the original is better because it was the 70's and the girls were wearing SHORT SHORT shorts...)"
2,The Stepford Feminists,"I must admit to never having read the book, but from its reviews, the movie manages to follow it closely enough. The plot would work much better if more men were actually like the men of Stepford. Some reviewers obviously think that MOST men are like the men of Stepford, or at least most men were until this movie came out. This says more about some people's fear and loathing of healthy masculinity than it does about anything else. Seriously, ladies, stop judging all men by ""The Man Show,"" unless you want us to judge all women by ""Oprah.""That having been said, this film is an interesting caricature of a certain SMALL segment of the male population. Or perhaps it is an unintentional parody of '70s feminist paranoia. If only the feminazis who blast women who don't follow in their own jack-booted footsteps were as tolerant of other women's choices as they demand others to be accepting and approving of there own."
2,Stepford Feminists,"I was too young to see this when it originally came out, but finally saw it on cable. This is a movie whose themes have not aged well, but it is a very campy little time-capsule of a film.The politics of the 1970's equal-rights movement are really perplexing viewed through a post-feminist lens. The women in this movie all whine because their husbands want them to actually stay home, cook, clean, and raise the children. Horrors!Frankly, with such selfish, self-absorbed, whiny creatures as depicted in that movie, I found myself rooting for the husbands for turning them into robots. Thankfully, the Battle of the Sexes is fading into the shadows of pop-culture history, and I think (hope) men and women are re-learning to value and respect each other and the complementary roles we play."
2,Oh no! The big bad MALE is going to get me!!!!,"As a feminist, I hate movies that portray women as victims who struggle futile against the big bad evil MAN.There are no good men in this movie. There are no evil women.Such portrayals of women are demeaning. We are human beings, just like men. We are capable of evil. Men are capable of good.Yes, some men would turn their wives into robots if they could, but so would some women! And I find it ridiculous that not one man stood up for his beloved partner. I find it ridiculous that not one woman was capable of true evil. Are we puppets?It also bothers me that if these women are so strong and powerful, that they are helpless against the big bad men. The message seems to be that we can't save ourselves. We are just doomed to be what men want us to be.I hate this attitude. Men are not all powerful. Women are human beings, not saints.Two stars, though, for capturing the fears of women everywhere."
1,waste of my time...,"This movie was so bad! It was very slow moving, and I kept waiting for something to happen. And then the ending! It really made me angry, what was the point of having this character Joanna go through the movie hoping she can do something to change what is going on in Stepford? Everyone is saying what a great campy classic film this is, but i just felt it was boring and didn't go anywhere. This movie is far to boring to be a horror/camp classic."
1,Perfect horror story for the 70's,After all the drugs of the 60's had strung out the hippies to the point that thier minds stopped functioning. In come the 70's and those same druggies think that stories like this make sense. So this is a 6 out of 5 for the stoners and 1 out of 5 for the coherent.
2,Hippies Rejoice!,"The thing with this book is that during the course of reading it there aren't many victims since its mostly all build-up for the end which is fine if it does indeed deliver. I was enjoying it ""knowing"" all hell would eventually break loose. *spoiler alert* Unfortunately what it all leads up to is a lesson about togetherness and being one with nature and respecting it. The little carnage is halted after everyone learns this and a *chuckles* conversation with the plants leads to a sacrifice. No, I'm sorry to tell you this is not the killer plant book one expects. Minimal plant activity, very few kills/attacks, and a build-up to not much of anything."
5,Good Night Music,"This CD is a great compilation of peaceful and beautiful music. I personally use it to get to sleep, because it helps to calm my nerves. It also makes a great companion when reading a mystery, fantasy, or romance novel. The music is also great inspiration for writing, if that applies to you. I would personally recommend this to any lover of fantasy, because this music has a great feel to it that I really can't explain. It's just.... beautiful. If you have doubts, get it from the library before you buy it... but this album is definitely a buy! (I got it in Amish Country several years ago.. I've listened to it every night since.)"
1,"The song I was looking for, wasn't on here.","I was looking for a mellow soundtrack. This wasn't it, and it sure isn't worth $60.00 plus for one CD. Never again will I order a Jeff Victor CD. It isn't worth it!"
4,An Excellent Read,"This is the first book I've ever read by Paul Cook and I was very surprised by the quality of the writing and by the novel's plot structure. At first, I thought the book was going to be a typical adventure story, but it quickly took off in its own direction. And the ending completely surprised the hell out of me! I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to read a well-plotted, well-written SF novel with all kinds of new concepts and interesting characters."
4,Exuberant Read,"Very interesting book! I could hardly put it down and I finished it in about a week. Paul Cook's latest publication is clearly the best. I enjoyed how the plot unfolds and was totally absorbed in the characters' adventures. The novel also explores important human issues of authority, religion, and questioning it. The latest scientific discoveries are taken further and expanded skillfully. I wouldn't be surprised if they made a film based on this book."
3,"Light, Weak, but slightly entertaining novel","I was first struck by how awful this book was. Very thin reading, no depth of character, trite metaphors, the whole nine yards.What saves the book however, is that the pace actually picks up and makes for a half fun (I didnt say ""interesting"", mind you) read.Also, its small enough that finishing it in a day is a breeze. So youve had your light reading, and youre ready to move on to better books afterwards.It's kind of a shame the book was as bad as it was, but I can't exactly remember why I bought it.-2 stars for not being any good, but 2 stars for relatively short period of pain, and 1 star for fun.Buy it used."
2,Astonishingly Childish and Bigoted,"The author has some MAJOR issues with religion and seems to hate Mormons with special vigor. The writing is smug, self-congratulatory, and juvenile. This guy actually seems to think that he is being cute.If he had filled his book with derogatory comments about African-Americans or Homosexuals, it would never have been published! But apparently he thinks it OK to make fun of someone if they are white and beleive in God. Well, it is not OK-- racism is racism no matter what direction you are coming from.All of this might be tolerable if the plot, characterizations, or writing was any good. It isn't. How did this garbage ever get published?"
2,Distinctly mediocre,More a series of disconnected short stories that jump all over the solar system in a very disconnected fashion. Some truly great ideas and great scenes but not tied together in a coherent or believable fashion. Buy some of the other great SF available here. Don't waste your money on this one. I didn't bother to finish reading it.
5,Great Plot and Great SciFi,"This is really an excellent novel. I had never read anything by this author, little wonder since I find nothing else by him in the catalog. The writing is clean and the plot moves well. I thought the book was fair in the first few chapters. After further reading I thought the book was pretty good. By the time I got to the last few chapters I was tense and anxious to see the conclusion in a way that I have not been in quite a while. I am eagerly looking forward to more works by this very talented author."
3,Slight space opera,"...Engines of Dawn is fun, but is nothing to write home about. Characters are flat if likeable, plenty of cliches are trotted out, and the sexual innuendo is a bit forced. Also, if you're paying attention you'll guess the big secret about halfway through. Having said that, it is quick and something of a page-turner toward the end. Also, a touch I particularly liked is that many starships are named after porno actresses..."
3,Would use it again.,"I have an extremely dry scalp, and it helps! It smells slightly like kerosene, but is a good shampoo. The stink dissipates."
4,"For sensitive scalp, smells better than Neutrogena T-Gel","This DHS Tar Shampoo seems to do the job and the fragrance is not as irritating to me as the Neutrogena T-Gel. My husband has a skin condition that requires use of a tar shampoo, but every time he used T-Gel, its fragrance/odor really turned me off and made my throat constrict. DHS Tar Shampoo has a mild fragrance, does not smell like ""tar,"" and is recommended by the allergist. It is priced competitively compared to T-Gel. He likes it, so I like it better."
2,on autopilot,"Mid tempos rule the day. There's just nothing here with FIRE in its belly. If you haven't already done so, go pick up ""Urban Coyote"" by Unida or ""Exam Room"" by Hermano."
2,A New Era For Queens,"I've listened to the cd 5 full times and these boys are all over the map.The biggest thing lacking is the drive on all but one song (sick,sick,sick). The rest is a jumble of misc. garbage. Not worth the price or time and makes lullabies sound like a 5 star album. Maybe the loss of Nick Oliveri is catching up with the band in the song writing department on the second release since his firing."
2,What went wrong?,"I've listened to this album at least once a day since its release a few weeks ago waiting for that moment when it grows on me. The last two QOTSA albums, particularly last, grew on me instantly and I couldn't stop listening to it. This one is not a rock album in my opinion. It's not 'cool'. Its certainly not catchy like the others are. I never once found myself singing along with Josh enjoying myself. The guitars are repetitive and thin. The drummer sounds like he was drunk for part of the recording. In fact, I find the majority of the tracks on this album to be annoying. So Im left with the question, what happened? I'll more than likely buy their next album hoping for a gem, but this lump of coal spend a lot of time on the shelf. Sad."
5,their best,"I thought it would be tough to top Lullabyes to Paralyze or Songs for the Deaf, but they have done it with Era Vulgaris. This is an album that needs to be listened to as a whole, each song flows so well into the next. You need many listens to appreciate this, so give it a few more listens."
2,Era Mediocritus,"For the past 10 years or so, the Queens have consistently released some of the best rock music to be found anywhere. Though invariably loud and abrasive, their songs ranged from the eerie and ominous to tightly structured pop classics that were never derivative. Coupled with decent lyrics and great musicianship, they stood distinctly apart from and far above their peers. Unfortunately, none of this is evident on the new release. The songs meander and are reminiscent, to me at least, of a style personified by the Greatful Dead...much harder, of course, but just as uninspiring. Sick, sick, sick a supposed standout here, reminds me of another clunker of theirs, the repetitive and just plain stupid song, Feelgood Hit of the Summer (an anthem for brain dead meatheads). Every good band delivers a clunker on occasion and they have risen (or stumbled?) to the occasion on this CD.P.S. After repeated listenings, it gets much worse."
3,Bubble gum,"Era Vulgaris could use some distorted, low-end guitars from Songs for the Deaf... and what's with that Rock Band music video for 3's and 7's?"
5,Queens have done it again,"By the end of the year, I am confident this album will be one of the top 5 hard rock releases of 2007. Maybe even top 3 if Pumpkins, V. Revolver, W.Stripes and Interpol suck. This band is very talented and continues to deliver consistent material despite changing members. Always refreshing and original. Would you want an artist to sound exactly the same every album?? I wouldn't. One of the reasons this band is so talented is their range, they can do uptempo and frenetic, mellow, and in-between stuff very well. I like the whole album, but the immediate standouts are trks #2,3,4, and 9 -""Suture up your Future."" This song captures my mood perfectly this year -all the stress I've been through the past 2 months. Can't get it out of my head. All three albums deserve 5 stars. It'll be hard rating this album against Lullabies which I absolutely adore."
2,Could have been alot better,"Needed more Mark Lanagan. Needed more Nick. Needed more dave. Needed more of the unique things that mades QOTSA the great band it WAS. All you nick haters out there need to get real. Josh was doing al lthe same stuff as nick. Josh pulled a major powermove. Josh is a baby and is even on probation for breaking a bottle over the lead singer of the dwarfs head. Why did he do it? cause josh was pissed that they let nick tour with them. What a child. This Album reflects current ""Josh Hommie Band"" attititude."
4,Heavy Hypnosis,"This album isn't as instantly likeable as previous outings by QOTSA - even though some tracks grab you from the first play. It is only after repeated listening that some of the subtleties begin to reveal themselves and the real craft that's been put in comes to the fore.If there's one word I'd use to describe the appeal of this band it's ""energy"". Even with a new band line up this is tight, heavy and above all energetic. It gets into your head and makes you move. The tone isn't exactly dark but it is brooding, atmospheric and has that hint of danger that gives the music a real edge. The singles are good and give you a flavour for the album but it's only when you hear this album as a whole and enjoy tracks like ""River in the Road"" and ""Misfit Love"" that you'll see what's going on.I'd highly recommend it."
3,A little disappointed...,"I've been a QOTSA fan for a long time, but this album is a definite departure for the worse. Not nearly enough of the heavy riffs we have come to expect. Most of the songs are passable, but only a few stick out. ""Sick, Sick, Sick,"" ""Into the Hollow"", and ""Misfit Love"" are all OK as far as the first half of the album goes, but definitely skip Battery Acid. After this point, the album starts to pick up, but it's a little too late. Definitely pick this up if you are a QOTSA fan, if only for the studio version of Make it Wit Chu with Mark Lanegan on vocals.I don't know, it sounds like they made this album for hipsters and not rockers. My two cents anyway."
5,An excellent rock album,"I'm not going to do a play by play of the album because reviews in general are just opinions so that would be a waste of your time. I will say that this album is very cocky, indulgent, dark, and delicious.You can go to their website and hear the whole album. If you like it, buy it. Simple as that."
2,Queens Of The Stone Age? More like The Josh Homme Band,Let me say first of all I love QOTSA or rather loved. Anyway simple thing is Queens ain't nothing with out Nick Oliveri.
4,Q. O. T. NEW AGE!!!!!!!!,"I really have liked all of what Josh Homme has put out.Rated R will always be my fave,but do love his latest,Era V a lot and previous 2 albums.It has a mix of fun diddies.Harder,softer,just a fine mix.Sick,Sick,Sick,Into The Hollow and battery Acid are my faves on the album,after a few times listening.Other goodies are Turnin' On The Screw,Misfit Love,Make It Wit Chu,3's & 7's and River In The Road. It's a real good album from start to finish.I don't think old QOTSA fans will be disappointed and many new fans should be made. It is a solid 4.5 and am sure the future will get only better.Just straight in your face,fun rock.Get it or you will regret it!!!!!"
3,No Nick...No Dice,"This is probably the most ""experimental"" Queens CD thus far. Sorry to say that without Nick Oliveri in the band the last two CD's have been lame as compared to the first three. Mark Lanegan is hardly featured and the new ""members"" couldn't hold Josh's jock strap if they tried. The remake of ""Make It Wit U"" is also nowhere near as good as the original. There are a few decent tracks on the CD but if anyone states that ""3s and 7s"" is the best song Queens has ever written I think I will puke. The best Queens song ever written is Infinity - HANDS DOWN! Bring back Nick and turn up the amps PLEASE!!!"
2,Extremely disappointing,"I've been in love with Queens of the Stone Age for some time now and this CD is absolutely WRETCHED. The ONLY good song is ""3's and 7's"". Period. NOT WORTH THE PURCHASE! Just buy that one track and forget the rest of this album."
2,Queens of the Stone Age,The cd sucked so bad. I can't believe they even put this out. It is no lullaby!!!
2,huge disappointment,"like most of you, i LOVED songs for the deaf, and i enjoyed lullabies to paralyze enough to buy era vulgaris. but when i got it home and started listening, i was thoroughly disappointed.i'll admit,some of the songs have a certain appeal that grows on you the more you listen. especially the first two:turning on the screw and sick sick sick. another halfway decent song is suture up your future. the only 2 good songs on the album are make it wit chu (a great song) and 3's and 7's (my favorite queens song.) but everything else is an obscure attempt at pushing artisitic creativity to the point where the album just becomes bad.i give this album 1 and a half stars.do NOT buy it.no matter how much you love the band."
2,Not Too Exciting,"Queens of the Stone Age - Era Vulgaris (release date: June 12, 2007)straight to the point --->This album is, unfortunately, pretty monotonous, not very melodic and it doesn't rock nearly as much as this band is capable of. It's not horrible, but it really doesn't do anything for me. And ""Make It Witchu"" sounds like a failed attempt at a pop single and sticks out from the rest of the album like a sore thumb. I've heard some great rock from this band, but I don't think I'll ever bother putting on ERA VULGARIS again."
4,Would be even better...,"...if it had all the songs! Title track ""Era Vulgaris"" for some reason was left off CD. Also the song ""Running Joke"". ""Era Vulgaris"" I downloaded using a peer-to-peer file sharing program (I think it was legally given away for free at some point, though I could not find it on the QOTSA website). ""Running Joke"" is included when you buy this from a certain online service.It's a shame the CD doesn't have these two songs. Other than that, it's great."
1,Super Pissed! (use the American English translation),"Total Junk! Who is this posing as the Queens? It should have been an Eagles of Death Metal (like calling a fat guy Slim) album. To quote an old Wendy's commercial,""Where's the beef?"""
1,Follow up to Era,"I gave this cd my best shot since I've been a big fan of the band.I thought Lullabies was off but in a good direction.This cd is just off period. It's dull, boring and mindless.I have sold the cd already. Not worth a dollar and sure won't make you feel like a millionare. It Sucks..."
3,Decent - Doesn't compare to albums 1 - 3,"Era Vulgaris isn't too bad, but pales in comparison to the self titled album, Rated R, and Songs for the Deaf. While I do like the album, I would have to rank it last when ranking their 5 major albums.For those of you who got into QOTSA during the Songs for the Deaf album, go check out Rated R and the self titled album if you haven't already.You can currently hear this album for free on the band's official web page."
5,Truely a Blessing!,"This is a tremendous book. It has added to both my quilting and prayer life. The writing is exceptional and the quilts with related prayers really lead to deep reflection. I would recommend this book to anyone who is struggling to find their place , whose creative juices have stopped flowing, and for whom quilting and the needle arts is their place of refuge."
5,words can not express!,"I would like to say thank you GOD for giving us ""Will""! This album obviously was a good point in Will's life, it just showed so much of his creativity. I would also like to add that this album did alot for my life during that period. I can only say I love you Will. Keep it Up!"
3,"Smooth vocals, bland choices, o.k. CD!!","Will Downing has the smoothest voice in Jazz. I bought the CD 5 years ago for his cover of Angie Bofil's ""I Try"". I was hoping the rest of the CD would be just a great. It falls short. However his vocal style gives the listener something different. Good effort."
5,A Drean Fulfilled,I have purchased this CD 5 times since it was released. It remains one of my very favorite. Hats off to Will Downing for making my evenings listening to you memorable.
3,Gigong,"It was a little too complex for me at this time. I got some good ideas of how wide this field is, so hopefully in the future I can expand with it."
5,Best voice for not-the-best Musical,"Although Bravo Giovanni might not be the best musical in history, Cesare Siepi might have been the best voice in history. If you are a fan of Cesare Siepi (""sovereign bass of the Met and La Scala"" according to Voice of Firestone), then this is a must have recording. Songs such as ""If I were the man"" and ""Miranda"" are sung without compare by Siepi. I'm happy to be a proud owner of this recording."
4,Heavy duty in every sense,"What the photo doesn't show is the monster heat sink sticking out of the rear of this unit. The vanes are about 2"" long and have unpleasantly sharp corners. If that doesn't bother you, and you're happy to own and use a piece of equipment built like a 1950s refrigerator, Tripp Lite certainly does the job. I don't know why it has to be quite such a massive object, but the heft does induce a feeling of trust."
5,Unfortunately Necessary,"With the godlessness in our times and the severe increase in violence, this book goes a long way in preparing one mentally for the possibility of an incident and how to best respond. A level-headed approach that is very helpful."
5,Some of the best most frightening stories!,"This is a reference for every eerie and nasty folktale in Jewish culture. From Maimonides and the Homonculus to tales of the angel of death this book can only be compared to the Grimm Brothers at their most evil.It is so sad that Sarah MacLachlin and neo-pagan feminists have tried to make Lilith into some Gloria Steinem type of symbol. Her destructive and glorious power is something that should never be defanged, and the Lilith stories in this volume prove it."
5,Top-notch! Entertaining but also with educational value,"This an absolute delight of a book, with stories that will entertain adults and children alike. A number of the tales focus on Lilith, but there are also a good collection of other supernatural beasties here.Howard Schwartz is a first-rate scholar and even provides footnotes and background on the stories he presents. The information on the history of Lilith here sticks to proven facts instead of farfetched speculation and outright errors and fantasies most other books on the subject are filled with.I highly recommend this collection and Schwartz's other books of fairy tales as well."
1,Wrath of the Goddess,"This book is a waste of precious resources, time, and money since a mind is a terrible thing to waste besides your money I do NOT recommend this book. I found it boring, trivial, stupid and mundane but am happy that there's the ability to preview this SEXIST blasphemous collection of worthless jewish folktales before purchasing such trash...AmeriKans As Marilyn sings it ""turning literature into litter""!!!"
4,A little overproduced but a great band and a great album,"Out of all of the slightly stoopid cd's, this one is definately the most produced cd. If you like sublime, you will in fact love this cd and/or any other slightly stoopid cd mostly due to the fact that Bradley Nowell (lead singer of sublime) discovered and mentored these guys. I really like all of their cd's but none of them can quite capture how amazing they are to see in concert. Very laid back with a big mix of styles. It is always nice to have a cd that is good that nobody really has or knows of (outside of So-Cal). Buy this cd or any other Slightly Stoopid cd if your into that kind of music and you will not be disappointed."
5,It's good....without the punk songs,"I discovered them through a listening station and thought they were good enough to take home. They have an eclectic mix with the obvious reggae influence that really works for them.However, the punk songs don't work for them...at all. I try to listen to them, but end up skipping them a lot. I'm a big punk for going on 12+ years from Bad Religion and Anti-Flag to Pennywise, and I know good punk. They shouldn't try, really. It's too easy to make a disposable punk song, and really hard to make a good one.It has become one of my favorite albums for being so original, but only 11 of the 14 tracks are worth a listen."
5,Talent that's been missing in music!,One of the top CD's I've listened to in a long time. You'll never really understand the true talent until you see them live. The energy is crazy and the sound is even better. In a few years I think they could even be better than sublime! Great mix of styles keeps everything flowing through the entire CD.
5,Talent that's been missing in music!!!,One of the top CD's I've listened to in a long time. You'll never really understand the true talent until you see them live. The energy is crazy and the sound is even better. In a few years I think they could even be better than sublime!! Great mix of styles keeps everything flowing through the entire CD.
4,THE TITLE SAYS IT ALL,"If you are into rock/reggae/acoustical music, this CD is worth your while. It contains good music and catchy hooks. My friend told me about this CD and I am glad I bought it."
4,3.5 Stars...,"I don't want to dissuade ANYONE from buying this album because this IS a GREAT band and they deserve some recognition. I'll just say: If you are already a fan, don't expect this album to have the sudden shift from mellow-reggae-beats to crazy-surf-metal that appears on other albums. If you're not already a fan: I think that if you are a Long Beach Dub All Stars fan who thought the song ""Sunny Hours"" was TOTALLY AWESOME, then you'll probably dig this album. If you're looking for more surf/punk/reggae though, go with the other Slightly Stoopid album ""Longest Barrel Ride"".Favorite song on this album: Runnin' with a Gun"
3,Don't start with this one,"If you plan on buying your 1st Slightly Stoopid CD, don't start with this one. It is good but no the best. It is over produced for sure.""Sweet Honey"" jumps into boy band territory and was obviously the attempt at a radio single (gone bad). I hope that wasn't SS's idea. I could have done without the John Denver cover. It's just boring. Despite what other reviews say here, the rest of the album plays good. If you want more Punk and ska then try to find their 1st out of print (I think) CD which is self titled. If you want punk and ska with more reggae, get The Longest Barrel Ride. If you want less punk and ska, more reggae and roots, then pick up their new album, Closer To the Sun. They have incorporated their roots style that they had been forced to rely on during times without a drummer, into their new album. Also touring w/ G. Love often has rubbed off on them."
3,it's about time,"This CD is alright. I have all slightly stoopid albums, and think of them as one my fav. bands next to bargain music and sublime.This CD is really polished and ready for radio.It's not there best but it will be they're most played OUT....Get Magic is Over or 77-oo3 also from bargain music"
3,Everything I Dont Need,Sublime and Long Beach Dub Allstars no longer are around so Slightly Stoopid will have to do for now.
4,good reggea surfers band,"its a really good ,band that remind me of sublime, BUT WHY THE SONG KILL ME DEEP INSIDE IS SO MUCH BETTER ALIVE ,THAN THE ONE OF THE ALBUM"
2,buy Longest barrel ride instead,"Slightly stoopid is a very original band, with great reggae songs and great metal songs. However this Cd offers a new genre that is all to familiar. Pop. However the reggae and metal tunes can still be found, this Albums simple and unimpressive guitar and constant Dj scratches puts Slightly stoopid in the same catergory as hundreds of other bands. THis album was a huge dissopointment. The Bands previus album, ""the longest barrel ride"" is a true masterpiece and you can find it on Ebay for about 30 bucks(its worth it). ""everything you need"" is not a bad album but chances are you already have it under a different artist."
2,DJ's and Drum loops ruined a great band,"The melodic harmonies, thundering walking basslines, and great riffs that made slightly stoopid's longest barrel ride a classic have all been swapped for DJ scratches, Drum Loops, and guest rappers. What happened guys? I am Really disappointed."
4,"""Everything you need"" holds true to its title","Not a bad cd, thisis the only slightly stoopid album i own and i like it qutie a bit. But i would never listen to its for its 'punk' music. The reggage and easy listening music is great to listen to and their rendition of ""leaving on a jet plane"" is great. a must buy for long beach dub all star and sublime fans...but be open mindined!!! peace"
3,Loved it,"I really enjoyed this album. I was a huge Sublime fan, you know ""back in the day"" this was the closest thing I have found that is similar. This cd is all over the place, some rapish stuff, reggae stuff, and crazy rock stuff. It is a fun album"
5,You need this for a first trip to Charleston.,"I just returned from Charleston and used this book. It was a joy to use. Best little travel guide I've seen. It covers the major information for planning a trip and then it becomes a highly portable reference book while there. Highly recommend this book and ""The Best Little Map Of Charleston"". You need little else"
3,Just an OK Guidebook,"This guidebook gave an ok overview of the area and seemed to hit the highlights, but it also felt like it catered to the lowest common denominator. If you want to stick to the tourist sights, this is a good option. For a more in-depth guide with a realistic assessment of the attractions and at least some sense of local color, consider Moon Publications guides."
4,Frommers Charleston,"A good resource. We used it a bit, especially the maps. Charleston is one of those towns that you just have to get out of your car and get lost on foot."
5,Amazing,How marvelous is God's love and grace expressed in Mr. King's testimony throughout this book. I was overwhelmed with the miraclous change in this man's life and yet not surprised in what the power of God can accomplish in one's life when the heart is open only to His will. A living testimony written to further accomplish what God has for each of us when we look to Him for deliverance. A book you will not put down when you once open it's pages. Thr first thought will be to pass it on. God's grace is truly amazing.
4,Remarkable account of the power of grace,"This is a remarkable, touching story of God's grace at work in the heart and life of a man a lot of people -- including himself -- thought was beyond redemption. God has no limitations when it comes to reflecting His limitless love for those who respond to His love, His mercy and His grace. I felt compelled to continue to discover more about this man's life, the driving force in his redeemed life and the ministry he has started to reach other men in the a similar situation as he was when he was so uniquely touched. It is a powerfully inspiring story for all of us. I highly recommend it."
4,Inspiring and Challenging,I read Terry's book in nearly one sitting. It's the kind of book you just can't put down. The end of each chapter entices you to get into the next one. It's good to finally read of someone who takes responsibility for his own failure and sin without excuse.
1,swat 3: elite edition,THIS GAME WOULD NOT LOAD ON MY COMPUTER.I do not have a clue as to why just that it did not load.
4,great read,"I read it cover to cover, great fun, lots of fascinating history of the collective. The pizza recipe I tried was excellent. But if you are looking for a book with lots of detailed information on different cheeses and what to serve them with, note that you won't find that here -- the food focus is on baking."
5,One of the best books out there!,"I love this book!Love the history and stories and pictures included throughout the book. The recipes are amazing! I have had so many complements on the breads I have made from the book! This is a great book of recipes - tried and true! I would love, love, love to visit the store when I get out that way!"
3,Colors are different than they appear,We received this screen and were very surprised when we opened the box. The seemingly green leaves look bluish and the cherry blossoms are very bright pink. Just beware of this before purchasing!
5,The greatest Irish album of all time,"In my own opinion Hearthworm is the greatest Irish album of all time and was recently voted in at number 5 on an all time greatest list by an Irish music magazine.How this band never made it big is a travesty because they certainley had the talent.This album is extremly hard to get so dont hang about buy it now,evrybody should know about this album.The band recentley reformed and played a gig in Dublin which i was lucky enough to be at and they were excelent.To pick out a stand out track is difficult because there are so many but 'we dont need nobody else' is my personal favourite,one of my favourite songs of all time from one of my favourite albums.If you read the rest of the review's you will sea that everyone has given it five stars and have said only positive things about it.There are not to many albums that get such universial praise,we all cant be wrong buy this album and share it with everyone you know you wont be disapointed."
5,"Highly collectable copy of ""The Holy Books Of Thelema""","This is the very nice blonde sail-cloth edition of the Equinox Vol. III, No. 9. ""The Holy Books Of Thelema."" It was a limited edition, either 500 or 1000 copies, available only by mail-order from U.S. Grand Lodge, Ordo Templi Orientis. It matches the Ltd. Ed. Equinox III(6) Liber Aleph, and III(10). I own all three of these, and they are quite nice, wonderfully bound, smythe-sewn, printed on acid-free archival grade paper. A worthy investment to your set of the Equinox. Any price under $150 for any copy of these editions in very good or better condition is a fair one."
2,"Not what I thought, but possible.",Bought the book thinking the author could have been some one I served with in Vietnam. Turned out it wasn't. I know people were making lots of money illegally while I was there. Thought what the author reported was entirely possible.
5,Pride and Greed,"Incredible journey in the black market and laundering of money in the Vietnam War. A must read for every American. Have proof read the original manuscript and read the published book. My son and grandson and now reading it.They cant put it down.Ernie Polte WW2 vetSan Clemente , Ca."
1,Mislabeled book,This item was not as advertised. Very misleading. Ended up costing quite a bit to return. Amazaon tried to charge half the price of the book for returning without ever looking at the book. Unacceptable!
4,"THE CONFESSOR, ONE OF JOE'S BEST !","This album starts off a little slow, but picks up steam as it goes and the second half is very strong. The title track is the best song Joe Walsh has ever recorded as a solo artist and ""Rosewood Bitters"", ""Slow Dancing"", and ""Dear John"" are as good or better than anything he's done on his other solo albums. ""Good Man Down"" and ""15 Years"" are also notable. Overall, the album has a more updated sound, but there is plenty of Joe's stellar guitar work throughout. His trademark sense of humor is here, as is his simple, unpretentious charm as a vocalist and lyricist. I only gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because ""I Broke My Leg"" and ""Bubbles"", although not bad, are lightweights. I still recommend this album, especially to Joe's fans."
4,The title track is Walsh at his best.,"""The Confessor"" is the song that many fans of Joe Walsh had been waiting for. Not since ""Rocky Mountain Way"" has he shown that he can rock with a vengeance. ""Good Man Down"" also is a good rock song. The rest of the album is a mixed bag, but the songs mentioned above make this a better than average album."
4,I bought this album in the 80's!,"If it wasn't for the song ""Confessor"" where would I be? But let me go back. In the wild's of Kentucky(1985) the glam rock was everywhere. I use to listen to 100KDF out of Nashville. They use to rock. That is when I first heard ""The Confessor"". WOW! What made it so neat was that we had a place, an old campground, where the only thing left was the old hot tub and pool, that is where we use to go. A friend and I had picked up our dates and headed there. Oh yes. It was a hot, humid KY night. We called our little place the HOT TUB CLUB. That's when we made this song the""HOT TUB CLUB "" song. Listen to it and enjoy. By the way,only 2 songs are on the album I liked. ""The Confessor"" and ""Hard to Keep a Good Man Down"".It's just a strange, mysterious and a different mood setting music. But it was good in the glam rock days when you needed something to really rock!. Rest of the songs are bad, except ""I broke My Leg"" which is different and funny."
1,"This book came with the title page half missing. Should not get even one star, but I had to mark it.","First, this book was said to be in great condition (used) from Montag. When I received the book, it looked good on the outside, but the the title page was missing the bottom half. How can someone say that a book is in good condition with missing/torn pages??? NEXT, I wanted this book only for Historical purposes of the life of Vladislaus Dracula, and the information in it was not as expected. It did not have anything on the time when Vlad was held at Visegrad, Hungary for the most stable period (14 years) of his life. It did not say about his marriage or even his children. This book dealt with only his time in Romania. The book was VERY SHORT and looked as though he only cut pieces of OTHERS WORK strapped together with minimal sentences to make this book. It was not worth the money, and I bought it used."
5,More Maine Sweaters,"This collection of patterns is a wonderful collection of classic sweaters. They are warm, wooly items that will be used often."
3,Product is good but the delivery was bad - a couple of tins got dented,The product is a good product. My baby loves it. The problem I had was with the delivery from the supplier. A couple of the tins were very dented and one was even punctured. I was furious. This is infant formula and it is certainly not the cheapest. Therefore I was not too happy with the delivery. I will not be ordering from that supplier again!
1,Another Joke by Munoz,"A better title for this book would be ""Forgotten Works By Antonio J Munoz"". Save your money and type your questions into Google. This is nothing more than a collection of copy & pasted facts from well known internet sources. Nothing new or original in this book."
5,"Adults laugh along, too!","My 2 year old grandson loves to listen to music in the car, and LOVES Sesame Street, so I purchased this CD for his parents, and one for me too. The songs are so cute, funny, easy to understand, and educational. There are 2 songs that my grandson laughs out loud to: ""Oh, Look What Our Baby Can Do"" and ""Everything in the Wrong Place Ball"". The characters voices are easy to recognize and the variety of songs make it a DEFINITE MUST HAVE purchase! Even grandma laughs along...."
3,silly songs,"this cd was ok, a little old for my 2yr old. We will no doubt enjoy it more in the future!"
3,Kid of dissapointed,"Good example of this doom european rock, but it is not my style. Maybe they have better examples."
5,An excellent interview!,"This is one of the best interview CD's that I have heard.Shania is very relaxed and candidly speaks about her marriage with Mutt,shares some very funny stories about Mutt and her fans and the listener can tell she is really comfortable and enjoying herself.I highly recommend this interview CD because it is so good that when Shania starts her contagious giggling,you will have no choice but to join in!"
2,"Runs, But Needs Work","As a former naval aviator I can appreciate Vistica's perspective of how the navy mishandled numerous situations. However, the books relies mainly on speculation, and would not ""hold up in court"". Public relations play a large role in politics and the military. Perhaps the navy should look into Clinton's spin machine; he seems to recover intact from seemingly inarguable situations. Ego and competition play a part in every organization, but when it occurs in the military, the results are often front page news. But 99% of the military is made up of outstanding, honest, hardworking individuals, paid with pride and a sense of honor (last sentence written to the Bloomington, IN critic. Yes, I'm glad you went the MBA route also. The military needs strong leaders, not weak followers)."
1,"Great Title, Boring Book","This book is a huge volume of information, not very well organized, about a small slice of naval history.The subject matter has great potential, the title is intriguing and the cover is eye-catching, but the book reads like a very dry college textbook. The sprinkling of pornographic photos add no interest or value."
5,A step-by-step process to release personal power,"Collaboratively written by Marilyn Graman and Maureen Walsh, and with the assistance of Hillary Welles, The Female Power Within: A Guide To Living A Gentler, More Meaningful Life is an insightful and highly recommended guide to developing inner strength, offers a step-by-step process to release personal power, and taking charge of one's own life. From identifying with our inner child, to visualizing the future and learning to enjoy life, The Female Power Within is an excellent and commended instructional to cultivating one's strengths and pursuing happiness."
3,Crazy Attempt,Take a good look at the country charts for Phil Vassars American Child the original album bombed on the charts after about a month and dissapeared from the top 40 album charts a major disspointment obviously for Arista Recrords because they probably have high hopes for Phil Vassar. I have never seen this before on an album now the person has got to buy this album again if they bought it before January that is the case with me because there a few new tracks here to make the album shine a little better with a power ballad called This is God a song kind of similar to American Child but in different context and a few other tracks were added. The rest of the album is kind of shuffled and I guess they could not pick another single off the album for the radio that is why they had to rerelease the record.
3,Somewhat of a sophomore slump for Phil Vassar,"The newest release by Phil Vassar does not measure up to the fun and depth of his debut...with the exception of AMERICAN GIRL, ATHENS GREASE and STAND STILL....the rest of the cd seems not up to his usual par. I am just not impressed with the lyrics or production....I hope his third release goes back to awesome songs in the veins of SIX PACK SUMMER, CARLENE and ROSE BOQUET as well as JOE & ROSALITA...next time Phil!"
4,Pretty good album-worth owning but not as good as the first,"I love this guy's voice and I love American Child and especially THIS IS GOD!!! Wow - this album is worth owning if only for that song (I do feel bad for those who bought it before the bonus tracks). However, it is not a future classic after future classic compilation like the first Phil Vassar album. If you don't have that one and you can only afford one, buy that! If you have that one or you can afford 2, go for Amazon's 2-fer deal and get them both. This one is worth owning and quite enjoyable in its own right. I'm not panning it, but just saying I was expecting FABULOUS and got simply really good instead!"
5,enjoyable sudoku variations,"I really enjoy sudoku, kakuro (cross sums) and will shortz, so I was looking forward to this book and was not disappointed. Here you'll find Wacky Sudoku, in which you are plying with non-3x3 subgrids; Hyper Sudoku, in which there are 4 3x3 grids embedded within the usual puzzle and these must also meet Sudoku solving criteria; ABC Sudoku, sometimes called Wordoku -- these were not terribly challenging; Killer Sudoku, a combination of Sudoku and Kakuro; and Kakuro. There are 100 puzzles altogether. Size of the book is good, 6'x9"" with nice big grids.I'd buy it again."
3,Puma Review,"The shoe runs about a 1/2 size small compared to normal shoe size. Keep in mind the cleat is a speed based cleat, in that it is very very thin. Probably a great shoe for strikers, I returned mine because they were both too small and too thin. I did really like the way the cleat was formed, it went more to a point than most other brand shoes."
4,Pedometer,It would of gotten 5 stars if it came with a battery that wasn't dead and I had to go buy one...
2,Hope it gets better,"Well my son just opened the pedometer, goes to use it and wont display- has a rattling noise, my husband took it to work and it may be the battery but the package indicates the battery is good for up to 1800 hours, well ours wasnt working at all, so now we are out the price of a battery, I do hope that was the only problem. So far not so good"
1,Wouldn't Work,"I have an Accusplit pedometer which I've used daily for a long time, & I love it. Bought this one for my husband and neither of us could ever get anywhere near an accurate step count with it. I returned it for a refund. He really likes to measure distance -- I only care about steps. Maybe that's the difference. Or maybe we just got the odd lemon with this one. Don't know. He decided to keep using his stop watch and forego the pedometer."
2,Not for senior citizens,I am a 68 year old granny who is quite active. I walk every day. My old pedometer only measured distance. I wanted to count my steps through this cold winter because I cannot get outside each day. I could not get this pedometer to set. The buttons are very small and you have to keep pushing them; once won't do. I went on the website for help and it shows the model but the intructions tell the incorrect color for the buttons. It is very confusing. I finally got it set. I called the 800 number and got told to leave a message. I would not buy this again.
1,"Defective, Defective, Defective","I was really excited when I purchased this as I prefer a small, simple pedometer.And for the first month it was great.Then one day I put it on and realized there were no numbers showing up on the screen, just zeroes.So I got in touch with amazon and they exchanged it for me.BUT the new one came with no numbers.So I had to return and refund both.Too bad, because it was exactly what I was looking for and am now without any pedometer. =("
1,Do not give to dogs with sensitive stomachs!!!!,I am a registered dietitian who ordered these for my black lab who has a sensitive stomach. I am a big fan of this line's other treats. They usually have very few ingredients and so I ordered these for our pup thinking they would be fine. BIG mistake!! When the package arrived I read the ingredients list and it has sorbitol in it...which is a sugar alcohol. This gives humans diarrhea very often but I tried giving her one just to see anyways. Huge huge huge mistake. She had diarrhea for 2 days straight every 20-40 minutes. I would not recommend these to any dog owner.
4,Delivered on time and the dog likes these sausages,"This is one of my dogs favorites, and as usual it was delivered on time so she is happy again.It's really easy to shop from the Amazon web page and their suppliers."
2,Not so muc,"Bought this along with some other treats for new puppy. Took me a while to get to these. Puppy isn't a big fan of these. He will eat them, just not with the same gusto as others."
5,Duck sausage dog treat,My Bichon really loves these and the reason we started using them is because they were made of entirely duck meat. He has bad allergies and the duck jerky & sausages were a treat he could have. Recently they have reformulated the product (sausage) and now they are using chicken liver in it. I'm disappointed in this because we usually won't feed him beef or chicken.This supplier is great and received my order in just a few days.
2,Not at all what I thought I was buying,"This cd is mostly instrumental. I bought it for my parents who enjoyChet Atkins voice and a particular song he sings. Not only is this CDmostly instrumental, we had to search the CD for their favorite songbecause the songs are misnumbered. Not happy with this purchase."
1,Terrible,"Sure Wish I had saved my money and purchased another of Chet's CD's instead of buying this one because of the reviews. I loved the picking, but didn't like the songs. will not play this CD again."
5,"Agreed--Almost Chet's Best, but still an incredible CD!","We agree with J.K. Olsen,Chet Atkins - Solo Sessionsis even better, but don't dismiss this CD. It is still features some of Chet's best playing. (Just listen to You Do Something To Me and Mr. Bojangles)Getting back to Solo Sessions, I think what people like so much is that (except for two tracks) it is all solo guitar! Listening, you feel like Chet is right in the room with you, sharing his latest arrangement. Very highly recommended!Chet fans should also check Guy Van Duser's tribute CD,Staying On the Atkins Diet. For another exciting fingerstyle/classical guitarist influenced by Chet Atkins, as well as Charlie Byrd, Earl Klugh,and Joe Pass, seeAcoustic Standards, Vol. 1andAcoustic Standards, Vol. 2."
3,"I still play it ""Sometimes"".","I've been a fan of this band since day one, and though I enjoy this album, I don't find it as pleasing as ""Vs."", ""Yield"", or ""Riot Act"". This is very similar to ""Vitalogy"" in my opinion, in that it is good, and very diverse, but just doesn't impress front to back like others do. However, I love the songs ""Who You Are"", ""Off He Goes"", ""Red Mosquito"", and even ""Mankind"". The others are decent, just not stand-outs. Overall a fine album, but not essential ""Pearl Jam""."
3,The weak link,"Being the big p.j. fan I am it hurts me to say this but this album is very sub par for their standards. Ten, Vs., and Vitalogy all had one nesscessary ingrediant important to a p.j. record and that ingrediant is:angst. The same angst that made ""Animal"", ""Not for you"", and ""The long road"" p.j. classics. Other than ""Red mosquito"" this album is forgettable. Now I understand that they wanted to switch gears with this album and I find that admirable but it says a lot that they pretty much went back to their old ways on ""Yield"". It tells me that they didn't care much for their new ""direction"" either. By the way the 3 stars are for effort only."
2,worst of all pearl jam's cds,"i am a great fan of pearl jam and i really like eddie vedder's voice but i think ""No code"" is terrible because the music is usually slow and they are much better as a hard rock group."
2,Pearl Jam's best ... are you insane?!?!,"My brother and I are big Pearl Jam fans, and I would never skewer No Code out of respect for the band, but No Code clearly was a record-company album and not the passionate Pearl Jam effort your reviewers describe. The album was rushed and unpolished, and my guess is the execs pushed it into stores sooner than they should have. There is some respectable material which works great for them live, but this album doesn't even come CLOSE to the work of the first three albums - and to suggest that Ten and Vs. are softer than No Code is preposterous.Thankfully, the albums that follow are a clear sign Eddie and the boys still have their chops (but with all due respect to Matt, we miss Dave)."
2,Krista's review,"I have no idea what they did with this one. All the songs on this C.D are either slow blues type or trying to be on the verge of pop punk. Favs on this C.D are Red Mosquito, Hail Hail, smile and LUKIN (that's one really heavy for them, you can't understand what he's sayin) If you like the more mellow blues side of pearl jam or just mellow blues music then this C.D is for you. The Cover art is different and unique as well"
4,Very much underrated,"I don't see why this cd didn't do well. I'd say almost every song is good, and it doesn't really have any weird crappy songs that most of their other albums do. I still say that Ten is their best, but this would have to be second best. It obviously has no defining radio hit, like a ""Jeremy"" or a ""Daughter"" or a ""Betterman"", but the songs touch you in a way that is impossible to describe. It includes both classic grungy Pearl Jam rock but also has some good slow ones too. So quit following ""the crowd"" and buy this cd now, you won't be dissapointed."
4,"not so bad, really...","While many people will undoubtedly hate this record because it's not ""Ten"" I think that it certainly has its merits. Although several tracks seem to be rather offhand and resentful, ""No Code"" does contain some of the most excellent of pearl jam's skill. ""Off He Goes"" ""Hail, Hail,"" ""Present Tense"" and ""Mankind"" are excellent. Lukin would be too, if only it was longer."
4,"An overlooked, solid fourth effort. My first PJ record.","This came out when I was starting to get into heavier music, like hard rock and metal, right around junior high. I immediately loved the diversity of songs on this album, but happen to think that PJ's first three albums were superior.This album has it's share of classic songs, even though they didn't get the attention of earlier stuff.""Sometimes"" is a slowly-building, mid-tempo opener.""Hail,Hail"" is one of my favorite rockers of all time.""Who You Are"" is an eastern-tinged mid-tempo single.""In My Tree"" is a fun, percussion-driven, brooding song.""Smile"" is a Neil Young-ish, groove-driven rocker.""Habit"" is probably the heaviest song on this album.""Off He Goes"" is another melodic ballad, in the vein of earlier hit ""Nothingman""."
4,4.5,"The most eccentric PJ cd. I love it personally. a lot of ups and downs. Aside from the last 2 tracks, this cd is beautiful. Especially the tracks : Hail, Hail, In my Tree,Red Mosquito and Present tense (which rules)... Great cd, but not in any particular genre. A sound and feel of its own. Love It!"
4,No Code,"By the time 'No Code' came out, most of the world had jumped off the bandwagon. That's not necessarily a bad thing. 'No Code' follows in the direction 'Vitalogy' was headed, and since 'Vitalogy' is my favorite PJ album I pretty much love 'No Code' too.For 'No Code', Pearl Jam decided to push the boundaries of their music a little further. New sounds and styles appear throughout the album. The harmonica in 'Smile' is one of my favorite touches, for example.At any rate, if you liked 'Vitalogy', give this album a listen. It may take a while to grow on you, but once it does, you'll be glad."
4,too mellow,"if you're looking for something mellow then this is the one. I love the sound that they achieved in this record though, specially the guitars."
5,WOW... TALK ABOUT TURNING YOUR BACK ON THE MAINSTREAM,"What an incredible album.That's the only thing I could say that would due this album justice... never have I heard an album with this much diversity.. ever..It's brilliance sums up the 90's in a whole, only pushes it to a further extreme, every area of great song writing is covered here, without any mistakes."
4,Smart mid-career triumph,"Arguably their last great work. It certainly fulfills the mellow contract Vedder signed which Vitalogy had been hinting towards, and though we see some rough spots straining to fulfill the musical wishes of fans past, present, and future (in particular their former heavy-rocking screamers which impressed on V take a beating here) the album remains a well-rounded snapshot of a thoughtful band in flux, in no small part from so many of the impressive transitions McCready and company impart on unsuspecting formulas."
5,Often overlooked,"I have every Pearl Jam album except for Binaural and must say that this is much better than the rest of their stuff. it has lots of diversity, a nice original feel that is rare in modern rock, and most importantly, amazing songs. ""Hail Hail,"" ""Smile,"" and ""Habit"" are excellent to rock out to, ""Who You Are,"" ""Present Tense,"" and ""I'm Open"" make for great experimental tracks, and ""Off He Goes,"" ""Sometimes,"" and ""Around the Bend"" provide for some excellent calm ballads. Make no mistake; this is one of the best 90's rock albums I've heard in a long time. If you are new to Pearl Jam, I'd reccomend starting with Ten, which conains the songs that made them famous, but anyone who has an appreciation for this band's music will fall in love with this album.This gets nowhere near the regognition it deserves."
5,Pearl Jam's best album to date...,"While this is certainly one of the least popular albums judging by sales it far exceeds this listener's desires in an album. While one must also note that it does take some different directions than pearl jam has taken in the past it also ends up being the most rewarding listen in the band's catalog.The album starts off with ""Sometimes"", not your usual first song rocker but it has great lyrics and nice music and end's with one of the the weakest songs on the album ""Around The Bend"". While not a particularly bad song it just doesn't do it for me.""In My Tree"" may be the best song the band has ever recorded. The music and vocals just soar...a masterpiece. ""Present Tense"" is another keeper. Just great lyrics and subtle but still powerful music.Overall I would reccomend this album to anyone. Definitely my favorite pearl jam album and one of the best disc's I own."
2,"Deviation Proves Fatal (to me, anyway)","I'm sorry, but I cannot give this CD any more than two stars because it is completely...well, just wierd. I have never heard of anyting quite like this, an while songs like ""Hail, Hail"" and ""In My Tree"" are quite good, the goodness stops there. Almost all of the other songs are very mellow, something that I'm not used to hearing from PJ. If they had done more songs like ""Hail, Hail"", it would have been a much better CD. Pearl Jam has always meant, to me, to be a full-steam-ahead kind of band, and their futile attempt to deviate from that has proven fatal to their usual kind of music. Sorry, PJ, but stick with what works."
2,the downfall of what once a great band,"I can remember years ago when I first got into Pearl Jam when 10 was their only album. That album was filled with energy and inspiration that I have rarely heard on an album. Songs like Once convey a sense of raw power while songs like Alive and Jeremy have a strong emotional attachments to them. Vs continued this tradition with songs like animal and go having that raw power and W.M.A and elderly women have that emotional attachments. However with vitology, the band began try things which is good but sadley the execution of that expirementation did not sound as good as their previous works. No Code sadley follows that tradition. It is difficult to listen to because of its unfinished sound. Songs like Hail Hail seem like they would have been good if Pearl Jam had worked more on the song. In the end, No Code fails to make a connectin that is strong with listeners."
5,Extremely underrated cd,"This cd totally missed the attention it deserves. I heard ""Who You Are"" like once 3 years ago and that was it. It's a good change from what they've done before. If you listen, there are similarities between it and Yield. Anyway, this cd has tons of good songs on it. Hail Hail and Habit are awesome songs to rock to (Habit reminds me of Tool), Who You Are is cool cause I like Indian rhythms, I love In My Tree (one of my all time favs) with all the polyrhythms. Red Mosquito's a really cool one, really Hendrix-y. Present Tense is an all time favorite, too. I am just so impressed with the lyrics. Anyways, to say the least, this cd should have gotten way more attention than it did."
1,"What happened, Pearl Jam?","I loved Ten, Vs. and Vitalogy, but on album #4 Pearl Jam seem to have collapsed completely. *Thud*. Only 2 out of 13 songs here are listenable, one of them is not even sung by Vedder - yikes!!! (does anyone understand the logic in that?)"
1,the worst yet...,"As a big pearl jam fan, i have been listening to them from their first cd. It was excellent, and i still do believe that it is their best. Since their first they have just been getting better and better until No Code came in. I bought it straight away because I am such a fan. I put it in my CD player and sat there thinking ""what a waste of money"". If you've heard Pearl Jam before and you like them then buy all of their cds, because they are all good, all apart from No Code. It is a terrible failure. Luckily, they have made up with Yield."
3,For Those About To Rock I Salute You,"I am a big Pearl Jam fan, but this CD did not impress me. After the first five tracks they seemed to just fall into the typical whiny rock of the Counting Crows. I still listin to this for the good music in it but there is very little original work compared to Pearl Jam's other CD's. This was the first one I bought and I almost did'nt get the others just because I did'nt like this."
2,They do so much better,"Being a huge Pearl Jam fanatic, I was really disappointed with this c.d. The songs almost put me to sleep."
5,Pearl Jam's underrated gem,"""No Code"" is possibly one of my favorite Pearl Jam albums, because it is their least mainstream, and more experimentational. It shows exactly how great a band they are, and especially when I caught them live on the ""No Code"" tour, it proved to me that they have more power than half the so called rock or alternative bands cranking out today. Jack Irons' drumming on this album is absolutely fantastic, especially on ""Who You Are"" and ""In My Tree"". Matt Cameron mangled the fantastic hi-hat smashes on ""Hail, Hail"" on ""Live on Two Legs"" by turning it into a ride-driven song. What a big mistake. ""Yield"" could not have been made without ""No Code"" and ""Vitalogy"" so all of those new found PJ fans have these two albums to thank for the great power that Pj is producing today."
4,"Hail, Hail! PJ's Four album Stands Out","Sure, it's no ""Ten"" or ""VS"", and it didn't stand up to ""Vitalogy"", but ""No Code"" is still a great album. It might be a little slow but listen to it more than once and it'll grow on you. It reminds me of ""Led Zeppelin III"". Sure everyone was expecting ""Whole Lotta Love Part II"" (or ""Spin the Black Circle II"" in this case) but instead you got hit upside the head with songs like ""Tangerine"" (or, in the case of PJ ""Who Are You""). It's the kind of insightful music that doesn't get produced in this world of corperate rock. It's an effort by PJ to do something that no one expected them to do, and I applaud that!"
2,Not the place to start with PJ,"If you're looking for the Pearl Jam CD to buy first, this isn't it. This is easily the weakest of their 5 LP's. None of these songs stand out. They all seem to be underdeveloped ideas or jams. There are a few worthwhile tracks however. ""Off He Goes"" is a nice ballad, in the spirit of the Vitalogy ballads. ""Mankind"" is interesting, but doesn't sound like Pearl Jam - Stone Gossard sings. ""Smile"" also stands out. It sounds very influenced by Neil Young, which is probably a decent prediction, as No Code was PJ's first album after recording Mirrorball with Young.Anyway, PJ neophytes will be well served to get any other PJ album first, as they are much more focused and consistent."
1,I just wasted 15 bucks,This is the worst thing I've every heard and I love Pearl Jam. How Sad. It only gets 1 star cause I have to give it something.
2,Not that great,"This album is ok at best, there are a few good songs, but it just doesn't rock as much as the first 3 albums. This cd lulls you to sleep by the 5th song. I probly won't listen to this album again, unless i can't sleep. Ten is still the best."
4,One of Pearl Jam's Best,"Although I can't say whether I like No Code or Vitology better I can say I think this ones better than Yield. Pearl Jam is one of those bands where all their albums seem on an equal playing field, its tough to compare. But No Code needs no comparison, it stands on its own. First of all it flows. From beggining to end it seems to flow as well as a continous album(Dark Side, Sgt. Peppers etc.). And with some astonishing songs like Hail, Hail I don't know how you coudln't like it. Oddly enough it didn't do as well as some of their other albums(probably due to lack of radio hits, go figure)."
3,Three and a half,"Most definitely not Pj's best effort, but still quite good. This album is very raw. Even the slower songs have a rawness to them. However when you compare this to other pearl jam albums it is probably their weakest. Not that No Code is bad, but it just doesn't compete with their other works. It doesn't have a song that you will want to play over and over again. I will still reccommend this album, because it's jammed packed with solid songs. There aren't any bad songs here, but not any great ones either. It IS a must have for any pj fan. And a good buy for anyone that likes rock music. Yet, if you are new to the band, this is the least essential of their works."
4,"Soft, yet pleasant.","Ok, I admit: after listening to Vitalogy over and over and over, at first ""No Code"" was a dissapointment. But then after many listens, it wore on me. Not many people will remember this album for much. Maybe some people will remember the songs ""Habit"" and ""Hail, Hail"" which the CBS orchestra preforms ocassionally on the David Letterman show. Both a great songs. But, probably the only two songs that rock...there are others. But then you might just enjoy mellowing out to the rest of the songs. ""Sometimes"" is a song that just captavates you...you can't help but relax to it. ""Up in my Tree"": ubeat song...one you don't want to skip over. And ""Smile"": has guitar playing similar to Neil Young, and some harmonica. It's great.A year ago it would be hard for me to give this album 4 stars, but now I just realize it's a Pearl Jam masterpiece...even if it doesn't have the high profile songs of the other albums."
1,Worst Pearl Jam album of all time,"i'm a big Pearl Jam Fan, but this is their worst album. Not one good song on the Cd. Don't waste your time with this one. Not one good song on it."
2,Epic Poem Becomes Clumsy Narrative,"This is an extremely poor translation of Beowulf for anyone who wants more than just a narrative summary. Wright has, by his own admission, eliminated most of the poetic language from the original poem. The poetic, metaphor-like kennings seemed to him puzzles and word games which barred the reader from the real meanings of the narrative. The appositives used in place of actual names and pronouns he found ""long-winded,"" and the poetic descriptions pretentious. Wright, apparently believing readers not intelligent enough to understand creative language, has given us a translation of Beowulf in the form of highly simplified prose, with few poetic descriptions or language that will ""distract the reader"" from the narrative. What remains is a clumsy, awkwardly worded translation which offers little to replace the poetry Wright has hacked out of it. Any lover of language will be deeply disappointed by this translation."
3,Okay as a translation,"The translation is okay, but hardly anything close to the original. If someone is merely looking for a translation of Beowulf, this book is more than fine, but don't depend on it too much if you're translating Old English."
2,Not impressed,"I thought this would be the perfect gift for my very artistic daughter. However, the graphics on it were quite disappointing. We actually returned it for a different product. Has potential, but not worth it at this time."
3,NOW she's afraid of the monsters,"My 3 year old loves this book. However, she never mentioned monsters under the bed until we read this book. Hmm.. seems that wasn't such a good idea to mention. We still read the book, but I skip over certain parts (monsters). I don't want to give my daughter something ELSE to worry about.Cute book. BUT if your child doesn't know about ""monsters"", then I would wait or skip certain pages."
3,Way overpriced!,This item was way overpriced. I found it at Walmart for $4.00. Unfortunately I misplaced my sale slip otherwise it would have been returned.
5,Great unknown artist,"Cage gained most of his press through his feud with Eminem. Claiming Eminem stole his style, Cage has a similar style to Eminem but isn't as politically charged and contraversial. His songs have an addictive quality about them but if you like one you will like em all. Off this cd my favorites are Unlike tower 1, escape to 88, Pussy, money, and war, and agent orange. Cage is also part of a group called Nighthawks with their song Nighthawk."
5,Don't try to stand off bullet holes show too much!,"I pre ordered ""Movies for the Blind"" on Amazon.com in August 2002 and still to this day it's in my cd player I cannot do without. This cd stays with me always from Amsterdam to Alabama! This cd is one of my most favorite hip hop / rap albums simply for the fact it's so original sound wise, and rhyme wise. Movies will stand the test of time unlike many other hip hop albums released in 2002. I discovered Cage via record store employee when looking for something new and different in the hip hop genre. After picking up Smut Peddlers ""Porn Again"" I was an instant fan! So, if you like hip hop but want something maybe you haven't already seem a million times on MTV you should pick this up, it's one of those cds that is an instant classic and good from start to finish! The title ""Movies for the Blind' speaks for itself!"
5,Periwinkle,"I ordered this toy for my great-granddaughter. She is in love with Blues Clues and she loved the Periwinkle toy. It was so convenient to order online and finding Blues Clues today isn't easy; but, Amazon made it easy for me."
2,If You Have To,"This is a decent selection of Emerson essays -- if you HAVE to read Emerson. His 19th century circular writing is tedious. Much more interesting is reading about him, his ideas and his times."
2,Self Reliance: Can we really Rely on Waldo!,"Not his best book,I Thought Waldo Lost in New York is more authoritive. I mean who honestly belives that someone who is always lost can be trusted to help other people become self reliant, when he can't even rely on himself."
3,"Good, for a ""thrift"" edition","While the text contains some real gems of Emersonian thought (i.e. Divinity School Address and Self-Reliance) it is not an adequate representation of his better works, leaving out ""Nature,"" ""The American Scholar"" and other more important and influential essays. I, personally, order this text for my Freshman English classes because it's cheap and gives two exemplary representations of Emerson for a survey course; however, if you are looking for a total package text that reflects what Emerson is capable of as a writer and thinker, you are better off investing a little more money and picking up a Norton or Library of America Edition of his works."
5,Love It,I'm going to admit that I actually sing along with Bert and Ernie in the car. I almost like it more than my son does.
4,Bert and Ernie's Greatest Hits,"These are the same songs I sang with my now 30 year old daughter and her son loves them too. ""Pat Pat Patty Pat"" is great for a 10 month old and older to try the motions and develop coordination."
5,A Classic Collection of Songs,"This is a must-have for parents who grew up with these songs, and can now share them with their kids! My 10-month old son lights up as soon as he hears ""Rubber Duckie"" or ""Pat Pat Patty Pat"". Not a bad song on this disc."
5,BEST CD EVER!,"All through my childhood, I grew up listening to Bert & Ernie... Ernie was my favorite:) About a year back, my older brother brought home the cd, he felt like ""reliving"" his childhood. After I listened to it, i realized how many old memories it brought back to me. I realized that I knew the words to each and every song! In no time I was singing and learning the songs to play on my guitar. I have spiced the songs up a bit, but I hope that someday I will be playing these timeless classics to my own children."
4,Not the favorite cd,"This has some cute songs, but is not our most requested Sesame Street cd. It can get annoying when played over and over, but the kids seem to enjoy most of the songs."
4,Love this!,"This is such a funny season. It felt a little off at first, but a few episodes in and they are back in their groove. I was excited to see that so many episodes had extra features like commentaries. However, most of the commentaries are by crew members which was a bummer! I wish the show was still small enough that the stars did the commentaries. They are much funnier special features on previous seasons. Still worth buying though!"
4,still funny after all these years...,still funny after all these years...this is a long season -> many funny nights of fun.
5,The Office Season 5 Blu-ray,The DVD arrived in excellent shape & earlier than expected!We will watch over & over again~
4,Review,"Price was good, shipping was fast. the plastic case that holds the dvd was cracked in several places."
5,Office,I am very satisfied with this purchase. It was priced much lower than other stores. Shipping was great. Arrived fast.
5,I do not understand....,This just proves the ill attitudes of the general public. So quick to lay judgment. This show is BRILLIANT. And when I'm done watching it always always always leaves me wanting more. Every single comedy I've ever seen has had more dramatic episodes (And now.. a very special Blossom) It makes the characters more real. And the comments above about how it was painful to watch and embarrassing. That is the appeal of Micheal's character. He gets into these positions where he does embarrass himself. Its just in his nature. Just be glad they are not trying to teach you a lesson in the show like so many comedies before them. Touching briefly on a serious issues only to forget about it the next episode. THAT'S Painful..I love the further development of the characters. And if they made the show be everything you wanted to right now for your quick fix.. they couldn't make anymore of this brilliantly wonderful show.I cannot wait for next season!
2,Soap Opera,"As with season four, in season five, the show's humorous moments are outweighed by the ""this is just too stupid"" moments.Too many characters - Michael, Dwight, Angela, Andy - come across as grossly exagerrated caricatures rather than believable people. They act so demented that, too often, the show is painfully stupid.During season five, THE OFFICE was sometimes funny, but it was mainly just a soap opera. The soap opera actualy is interesting for a few episodes when Micheal Scott leaves Dunder Mifflin to start his own paper company. Aside from that, watching season five is a waste of time."
3,Okay Season,"First, I really do enjoy watching The Office. It is possibly one of my favorite shows on television. With that said, I think that Season 5 is the worst season so far. I felt that there wasn't enough ""classic"" Office material, like Jim-Dwight interactions, Michael Scott-esque failures, and not enough Kevin time (but lets be serious - is there ever enough Kevin time??). I still will most likely buy this Season, but it will definitely not get watched as much as Seasons 3 and 4 do."
4,"Still funny, but not the best.","This was still very funny, but also had some serious parts that were a little much/overboard. Wasn't quite as good as the previous seasons, but still funny and worth a purchase if you're a fan of ""The Office""."
5,Good Stuff!!,"If you love The Office, you'll love having the seasons to watch whenever you want!! I have every season and can't wait to to buy Season 6 when it comes out!!"
3,Bearly Ok,"The only reason I rated this episode as three stars is that we finally get a real step forward in the Pam-Jim relationship. Other than setting up the show for the next season, this episode lacks genuine comedy and has a sketch that is one of the most ineffectual attempts at humour. If I hadn't gotten this episode for free through an Amazon promotion code I'd be very upset. Not an episode you would want to show someone who was starting to get into the show. I would recommend the purchase to loyal fans only."
5,Awesome Series,"More great fun from the office. If you've enjoyed the first four seasons, you'll love this one too."
4,The worlds smallest bluethooth...,"I loved this episode. My wife and I will be working for the same company in a few weeks and when I saw this episode where Jim and Pam use the worlds smallest bluethooth headsets to stay in touch with eachother it made me laugh and even get out on amazon searching for the worlds smallest bluethooth to see if they exist and I was surprised to see that they do! Anyways, this is a pretty funny episode, not by any means the funniest in the Office series but it is a good one."
2,poor disks,"The first disk in the series ran fine. The second had skips, the 3rd would not run at all. I am in the process of looking for my receipt and will be trying to return them for a refund. Not sure if I can, never tried before."
2,The Magic is Gone,"What happened to this show? The Office used to be an amazingly funny show. But halfway through the fifth season it became terrible! The comedy was bland, the antics, rather than clever, were just stupid, and characters were acting differently than they have used to. Are the writers/producers doing double duty with another show? My wife and I purchased seasons 1-4 and have enjoyed watched them over and over. The first half of this season was good, but my wife and I have only produced a mild chuckle during the last half of this season. We will not be purchasing this season at all or maybe when it goes on sale. I hope the writers/produers turn back the clock to when this was funny or ax the show at the end of season 6. If you are new to the series, don't start by buying this one."
3,OK at best.,"Wow. Compared to the other four seasons, this one kinda blows. I loved this show so much but this season is crap. If you want explanations on unanswered happenings (Meredith's face) on this season watch the deleted scenes.Also, some one thought it would be a great idea to cut all the scenes that would have made the season pretty damn good and funny and put them in the deleted scenes.So, ***WATCH THE DELETED SCENES*** That is where most of the laughs are."
5,fioninxs,"The gang from Dunder Mifflin Paper Company are back for another side-splitting season of The Office. Michael believes he's a father and hijinx ensue. Michael starts up a rival company to Dunder Mifflin and Ryan is back!Dwight is his neurotic self and Andy and Angela continue with wedding arrangements. The love affair between Jim and Pam continues, even with Pam in New York. This 5 disc set is chock-a-block with over 5 hours of deleted scenes,audio commentaries,bloopers and the extra special The Office 100th episode and 100 memorable moments, so sit back and get ready to laugh yourself silly!!"
3,good season/ not so good product,"I really love this season. But, the discs were not secured in the set. I opened the fold cover and a whole section of the plastic that holds the discs in fell out. I am going to re-glue it in and keep the product."
4,Pretty Good,"Most episodes are funny, but the episodes when there is a segway to another Office run by Michael aren't very good. Still worth watching!"
1,Didn't Work,"I bought this and it never worked at all, just kept loading for over an hour but still never worked. Asking for a review reminded me I actually paid for it so I'm going to try and go about getting that back. Great show, but buy the DVD's not the episodes online."
2,"Deceiving,,,,NOT New...Old and Crappy...","This DVD set sucked. First of all the box was old looking, dirty, and damaged. The DVD appears to be some sort of weird ripoff. It was edited, and the actor's mouths were blurred-out when they swore (not that that's a bad thing...but it was weird).Overall, I was very disappointed with this purchase."
4,More commentaries,"This is a great season I think.I'm always disappointed that there aren't more commentaries, or behind the scenes special features.But... what can you do?"
4,always enjoyed this show,missed this season due to school and work. recommend this show for some laughs and giggles. hope you also like it.
5,office season 5,"another great season of the office. too bad to hear about Steve Carrel leaving, it looks as though season 6 will be the end of a great show. hopefully not though. overal season 5 has its great moments though seasons 3-4 are the best, this season is not much of a let down."
5,The Office-Season Five,"This is one of the best TV shows i've ever seen,the funniest moments are when Jim and Pam are pulling pranks on Dwight,when Andy punches a hole in the wall after his cell phone is thrown in the ceiling."
5,Wonderfully written and teaches patience too,A very well written book which is appropriate for the upcoming Halloween season. It teaches patience through the story without making it at all preachy.
4,Extremely well done,"I found the text to be well thought out,extremely relevant, especially in the field of evangelism. Anyone considering starting a ""contemporary"" type service as an outreach should have this book on their shelf."
2,good insights but unpleasant reading,"Ms. Morgenthaler obviously knows what she's talking about, but she seems to have an attitude that she's writing for a group of clueless morons whose only hope is to agree completely with her and do things her way. This poorly edited book is written in a rather sarcastic, condescending tone to the point of ridicule if anyone does not agree with her. I believe most worship leaders will have discovered for themselves through experience Ms. Morgenthaler's insights in worship planning, and her expansive passages on musical programming seem to assume her readers don't even have the musical expertise to find middle ""C"" on a piano. So I recommend this book if you have little formal musical training and have never led a contemporary worship service and need a crash course in worship direction. Otherwise, spend your time planning your next service."
4,True Worship Attracts,"I found this book to be a great encouragement. It warns against dumbing down worship to evangelize and instead advocates an authentic worship that will attract even the unbeliever. While not all Morgenthaler's suggestions will ring true with everyone, she raises an important point for those led to consider seeker sensitive styles."
4,"Only 4 Stars Because ""Nebraska"" Got 5","This album will rip your heart out. Like ""Nebraska"" it is deep and thoughtful, perhaps not as ""dark."" It reminds me so much of Dylan at his best - listen to the harmonica.Much of it is ""derivative;"" the melodies go back to earlier stuff.I would, however, like to take this opportunity to say thanks to his backup - Max, Nils, Stevie and the rest of E-Street."
5,"It Will Grow On You, I Promise","I remember when I bought this album, I kind of popped it in the car CD player and played a little, stopped, got back in the car, played a little more, stopped, etc. Well, I did not have a very glowing view of the album, thought it boring and lacking. Sometimes I would pop it in the CD player and move around the house, picking up pieces here and there. Once again, thought, not that good. HOWEVER, I finally one night, crashed in my chair and put the CD on, listened to it the whole way through. WOW! WHAT HAPPENED!? It was as if my eyes were finally opened to a piece of art. I just played it over and over, still do. It's a concept album, not as commercial friendly as ""Born in the USA"" or something. But when you take the time to mellow out and listen to it, it is GREAT!"
1,Springsteen's sequel to Nebraska,"Bruce Springsteen is a rock icon because of thoughtful lyrics set to a rock sound. He did not begin to gain wide spread notice and sustained success until he departed from the folk style of his first two albums and released a rock album, which was both a commerical and critical hit.Springsteen likes this type of Dylanese folk whatever style of music and is rich enough to spend the time and money to make and release these type of albums.If you like listening to Springsteen play and sing by himself, you will love this CD. However, if you listen to Springsteen for rock do not waste your money (or your time) on this CD; rather, you might wait for the current tour with the E Street Band to end and hope for a live album. I do."
2,Overrated sleep-inducer,"I've been a Bruce Springsteen fan for most of my life, but I really can't get into this album. Folks, it's not his best album (that would be either Born in the USA or Darkness on the Edge of Town) nor is it a classic. Youngstown is a great song, but the rest of this album isn't that great. One review said that this album was ""the best driving music ever made"". Trust me, if you listened to this album while driving, you'd fall asleep at the wheel.If you want a great acoustic album by The Boss, check out Nebraska, one of the best ever made. The Ghost of Tom Joad pales in comparison.I've heard a lot of comparisons between The Ghost of Tom Joad and The Boss's latest album, Devils and Dust. For the sake of Bruce fans everywhere, let's hope those comparisons are false."
1,Buy it ... only if you a maniacal fan of Bruce !,"This CD is probably the WORST in Bruce's carrier . It is terrible from the beggining to the end , with a single exception .... "" Youngstown "" All the rest is something to forget . I think , Bruce should stay at home , instead of recording this garbage ."
4,amongst the most tightly drawn scenarios of his career,"As a long time fan of Bruce it was with great anticipation that I unwrapped this release and and then after a few spins dismissed it as one dimensional and simplistic. Then I dug deeper and discovered as strong of craftsmanship with lyrics as I've heard from him in some time. The mesh of themes from depression era hoboing to modern day immigrant woes is well woven without becoming a burden and the purity of the charactors is as realised as anything he's done this decade. This is one down album and it seems to suit these times as well as anything out there from the edge of the envelope of metallic harshness. Soft songs that bite, mangle and spit their contents back out on your boots. Not for those who've slacked off the anti depressants."
2,This is Bruce's weakest album!,"Bruce has been writng about the working man for a long time now. However, for the first time, the stories in his songs seem forced and artifcial. Like he is writing experiences he's gotten second and third hand, rather than lived. He's moved his characters out of New Jersey and into the southwest and it seems false. It dilutes the work and the message."
2,"""Nebraska"" it ain't","I was excited when I heard that Bruce Springsteen was going to record another album in the ""Nebraska"" mode. My excitement turned to disappointment, however, as I listened and realized that there are no songs here close to the power of that album's ""Atlantic City"" or ""Johnny 99."" What you get instead is a lot of standard folk-singer-stands-up-for-the-downtrodden tunes that fail to achieve any transcendence. Bruce's stand for the oppressed would be a lot more convincing were he not already a multi-millionaire rock star. This is a well-intentioned but ultimate self-indulgent effort from an artist capable of much better. Never was the need for Bruce to bring back the E Street Band more evident."
1,save your money,This album is a disappointment. Use your money to buy something better like The River. Only die-hard Springsteen fans would like Tom Joad.
2,"Unsure and tuneless, but Springsteen's not a lost cause","This is, to me, Springsteen's first wholly unsatisfying record. ""Lucky Town"" and ""Human Touch"" did not sustain the excellence of his work from ""The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle"" through ""Tunnel of Love,"" but they had a few moments on each of them worth saving. With the possible exception of ""The Ghost of Tom Joad,"" this album lacks the focus and haunting tunefulness of the Springsteen album it is most often compared to, ""Nebraska."" I admire the attempt to venture back out into America's lost stretches with a newer, multiethnic and all-encompassing point-of-view, but this album is in dire need of a melody, and lacks even the qualified uplift of Nebraska's ""Reason to Believe."" It's not enough to make me lose faith in his talents--it's just the man's first real misfire."
5,A great album,"The first time I bought this I hated it so much I sold it to a used CD store. I thought it was dull and depressing and it was an example of an aging rock star going through a serious mid-life crisis. Then I saw Springsteen for the umpteenth time at Madison Square Garden and heard him do some of this material live. I went out and gave Tom Joad another try and now it's one of my favorite Springsteen albums. Personally, I find it more meaningful than Nebraska. I think there's more anger and more hope in the songs, which are reminiscent of early Guthrie or even Leadbelly. Was especially impressed by the last song, ""my best was never good enough."" Granted, I can see that this album is something of an acquired taste, but if you're willing to stick with it and really hear the lyrics, this is possibly Springsteen's best."
2,Not quite up to par,"I hesistate to give this album less than three stars because of who this is. Springsteen is an important artist who justly demands respect, and I applaud him for doing whatever he feels like regardless of whether it's commercial. However, listening objectively, I find this album just doesn't work. An entire album's worth of barely audible guitar picking and intense muttering (and occasionally offkey singing) has tremendous potential to put you to sleep, except for the occasional Dylan-esque harmonica solo which may jar you unpleasantly awake. Springsteen already did a pared-down album before with ""Nebraska,"" and this odd attempt to be Woody Guthrie doesn't really hold up all that well in its general lack of melodies and overunderstatement (to coin a word.) The title song improves with listening, and the lyrics are competent."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzz,"Why is ""Nebraska"" great and this not? Both albums have great stories. The difference is that you can sing the songs on ""Nebraska"", in fact that album has some great melodies. I challenge anyone to hum the tune to ""Galveston Bay"" of Baloba Park"" right now. Stories are great, but they are only a part of songwriting. That's why Flannery O'Connor is known as a great short story writer and not a songwriter. Why does Springsteen not know this? ""The New Timer"" is simply wretched with a vocal performance that is so close to self parody that it would fit nicely on a Saturday Night Live skit.The title track and ""Youngstown"" are good, (the latter is actually much better as a rocker as released on ""LIve in NYC"") but they really only stand out because they have discernable melodies."
2,new????,"cd arrived without a security strip... was ddescribed and purchased as new. does not appear to be.....also,long pause before track"
2,Disappointing,"I was never really a Springsteen fan until I heard his ""Nebraska"" album. I was captivated by the eerie, gritty essence of the album and the blue collar storytelling. It became one of my most cherished albums.When I read that The Ghost of Tom Joad was a sort a ""sequel"" to Nebraska, I enthusiastically picked up a copy. Unfortunately it was a disappointment.The Ghost of Tom Joad is a highly polished, full-studio album and as a result, it fails to recapture the folky, haunted feel of the lo-fi Nebraska album. In addition, although the album has good storytelling and lyrical quality, there are few catchy melodies and little variety between songs. Halfway through the album it starts to get very monotonous. The title track is the only song that really stands out.I had high hopes for this album but ultimately found it to be mediocre and forgettable. In my opinion, it does not hold a candle to Springsteen's outstanding ""Nebraska""."
3,Missed Chance at a Masterpiece,"This is Bruce's should've, could've, would've record. There are some great lyrics throughout but he only achieves intimacy on tracks like Across the Border and Dry Lightning where on others such as Sinaloa Cowboys and The Border his narration seems removed, almost voyeuristic like Lou Reed. It works for Reed but Springsteen requires honesty and connection for his songs to translate. The arrangements and production hurt the impact of the record as well. Bruce incorporates the E Street Band into these songs live to flesh out their arrangements and they truly shine in a live setting. If he tackles another acoustic record, I would like to see hime use them in the studio this way as well. Finally, if the record is ever remastered and reissued, drop the awful last track and include the acoustic version of Brothers Under The Bridge from Tracks as the album closer and you have a 4 to 4.5 star record because despite the shortcomings, the writing still comes through."
2,his most diappointing album,the songs all start to sound the same after 3 tracks. a very talented man who needs to find a new inspiration.
5,Good thing Bruce has plenty of money,"That way he can afford to continue to make tremendous recordings that are sure not to sell to the narrow minded public(see many of the reviews below).Just when I thought I would never really like another Springsteen record,he comes up with this. This record does for folk/americana music what Born To Run did for rock.Way to go Bruce!"
5,One Of the Great Works Of the Late 20th Century,"A full four years after hearing this album for the first time I'm still haunted by it. The bitter resignation of the title song, the hard won wisdom of ""Highway 29"", the angry indictment of ""Youngstown"" and the transcendant beauty of ""Across the Border"" are just a few of the brilliant strokes that Springsteen paints here. After 25 years of almost consistant (and unparalleled) brilliance, expectations are almost unreasonably high for each new Springsteen release. With ""The Ghost of Tom Joad"" Bruce delivers a bulls-eye. Listen to this album next to ""Born In the USA"" to see how far he's come. A true masterpiece in every sense of the word. One that, I truly believe will be looked back on as one of the great masterworks of the century in American art."
5,this polly rocks!,i'm 9 years old and this toy is cool. the arcade skeeball game really works and it comes with stickers. it has a grabber toy that you just spin a knob and a bunch of charms come out so you can put a necklace on the doll.
5,It does the job!,"Why do you purchase a self-powered radio? For emergencies! This radio is a great value. My kids played with it (to test it) and then I put it in our emergency kit. It is easy to crank, powered up easily and has good reception."
4,Very good for the money,"This is very good for the money. Yes, it's larger than a ""pocket"" radio would be, but it's quite light. AM, FM and Weather bands all work well, and I found that a local TV station came in at the high end of the Weather band."
1,Total lemon,"I got this specifially for an emergency kit (because it supports the Weather band). When it arrived it would not take a charge from the hand crank. Like others noted, it would light up, but no power would get saved. Thinking that maybe the battery was really fatigued from sitting in a warehouse, we tried cranking it for 10 minutes straight. This only led to the crank falling off! (yes it fell off, and no we were not being rough).Batteries would let the unit turn on. Once on, the stations did NOT come in clearly, and there was ZERO weather band reception, just terrible static.I was very surprised about all the failures in this product. Jensen is a good name, and i could understand maybe one of these things happening as a fluke, but this product was a complete piece of junk."
1,"Radio works only with batteries, not by the crank","And if I'd wanted a battery operated radio, I'd have bought one!We cranked and cranked for about 10 min total, the charging light went on, but it only worked when we put in AA batteries. When I called Jensen with the 800 number in the manual, I got the message that all circuits were busy- this was during the day on a weekday.I am returning it, it's a dud. No wonder it was $15 instead of $50, like the others I see around."
4,Not bad,"This book was very interesting and well written, the pictures are good but limited in size and number. The overall book is good but I have read better, this one is good, but I need more than this book to take me to Cuba for a visit, so there are other books beside this one, but this one is very good on some categories"
1,cheap,Very disappointed.Thin gauge ? Stainless steel. Size does fit into my sugar canister which is why I liked the shorter handle but I would have sent it back based on its poor workmanship.
1,Why is it so difficult to make a scoop?,Like others I was looking for the ultimate pet food scoop and this one isn't it. The handle and scoop are made from separate pieces and have already come apart.Anyway I went withEndurance Oval Measuring 1/2 Cup Scoopinstead and its a solid piece.
3,beautiful watch but small,"The moment I opened the box I knew it's beautiful, for every detail. The color is exactly what I want: blue, mixed with a slight percentage of purple, which makes it outstanding rather than pure black.However, I had to return the watch because it looks a little bit small. The case diameter, described as 40mm according to the website, might be even smaller if you use a ruler to meature it. If you are looking for a watch that really looks ""Man"" then it's probably not a watch for you. I guess it might be suitable for those who enjoy the city life and have slim wrists.As for the accuracy I can't comment on this one since I returned it. However I have two other citizen watches, one eco-drive and one automatic. The automatic one gains time at about one minute per couple of months, but the other eco-drive one is very accurate, so I guess accuracy is not a problem for these eco-drive watches."
5,Best watch i have owned... have had it for over 4 years,"One thing that always annoyed me with analogue watches was the need to reset the date after every month. With this watch, once the date is set ( if set correctly) it will never have to be changed, even on leap years. The alarm function works and has the standard beeping. the LTM function is handy if you do a lot of traveling as it leaves the regular time the same and only lets you change the hour hand. The fact that it never needs a battery is also a plusCons: After four years of having the watch while wearing it constantly, the mineral has a lot of scratches in it. the watch has a lot less scratches compared to glass faces, but it also has a lot more than the higher end crystal faces have.Other than that I have not had a major issue since i bought the watch and highly recommend it"
5,Wonderful watch,"I bought this watch to gift it to my brother.We actually wanted a watch with black dial. This watch looks black in the picturebut when it arrived, we saw its not actually black.Its marine bluish and its fluroscent.But we liked the new color also. Very nice watch and its great for the price asother Citizen ecodrives are way more expensive than this one."
4,"Elegant, Elegant, Perrrrrrfectly Elegant . . . !","This watch looks gorgeous and its eleganza are why I bought it. I do wish that the watch face had true luminous. After a long time in direct sunlight, the hands and markers *ARE* visible but only for a very short time. That is my only gripe about the watch itself. I would advise NOT inserting the disc into your laptop as it has a virus bomb in it. Instead, read and retain the little instruction booklet."
4,Nice watch,The watch is as listed in the product description. Haven't had any problems with it so far. Would recommend it to others.
3,eco-drive,"Even with removing links in the bracelet it was an akward fit for a thin wrist.The dial info is hard to read and mostly gratuitous, and the overall styling does not equate to the price.Bought from Amazon online"
1,VERY disappointed in merchant and product,"After I purchased this product I found the same one on the merchants website with a better offer. I contacted the merchant who told me to send the watch back at my own expense, pay a restocking fee and I could receive their offer. Not exactly a good taste in my mouth from that reply......Once the watch arrived I must admit I was disappointed in it as well. It was not as substantial as I hoped, especially for a man's watch. There was nothing wrong with it, but I did not feel that it was as nice as similarly priced watches by other manufacturers. Personal taste I guess.In the end I returned the watch and was charged a restocking fee. I would never use this merchant again."
5,Simple Elegance yet full of features!,"Very elegant with simple looks. Not gawdy or bulky. I'm 5'10"" and weigh in at 230 pounds and am medium framed and this is the perfect size watch for both everyday and dress up days. I wear mine to church as well as working on the tractor and other equipment. I shower with it, swim with it, relax in the hot tub with it, I hardly ever take it off except when I know it will likely get damaged or expose me to a safety risk. I like it so much that I keep a spare around so that when it's time to replace the crystal from getting all scratched up I am not without my favorite watch. I've only had to get the crystal replaced once in 4 years but when it is time again I'll just box it up, send it back to Citizen like the last time and it will become the spare when it comes back! Great watch, I doubt you'll be disappointed."
2,Orange tips,"The clamps were very strong however, the orange tips snapped off on every one of them. They did not break off but came unsnapped and you have to snap them back on if you would like to use them. I tried supper gluing them ALL OF THEM so next time I need to use them I'll see how that works.If you glue them... they do not pivot any more."
3,Pretty Entertaining,"I've become very cautious over the past few years when it comes to buying anime. I can't even count how many times I've been fooled into thinking that the anime I'm buying will be awesome. Perhaps I'm setting the bar too high or it could be that I tend to buy an anime that just has cool cover art or an interesting sounding story from the synopsis on the back of the DVD. Well, I can safely say that this was worth the money. I intended to watch it with the Japanese audio, thinking it would be the better choice, but the English dub was very entertaining. Both lead characters are funny and likable that make for a continually interesting story. So I guess in summation, this was a very good, interesting, funny show that I would recommend to any anime fan."
4,"Many great songs I've been wanting, some that shouldn't be on here","This cd really has two group of songs. Songs that Metallica have covered, and songs from bands Metallica likes. The Master of Puppets cover is cool once, but not again. Loverman is worthless for metalheads. Tuesday's Gone doesn't fit in. The ones that really work here are the Motorhead songs, the Diamond Head songs, and the Mercyful Fate songs, (but where's Satan's Fall?). If you want a collection of classic thrash, buy the first one of these, only get this one if it is cheap. I got my copy for forty-five cents."
2,NOT THIS ONE.,"The first volume is very good but not this one. Basically it's the original versions of all the songs that METALLICA cover on GARAGE INC.The first volume makes one solid collection, and though this one has some killer tunes its a disoriented mix. Songs like TUESDAYS GONE, which I love, Lynyrd Skynyrd rocks, but it doesn't fit here.The first disc is the stuff that was underground when METALLICA was coming up the ranks. Its the stuff you'd expect to hear. The stuff that mom hates and it makes your ears bleed.The second has LOVERMAN by Nick Cave and the Seeds.WHile it isn't bad, it just seems to me like a way to make more money. I'm not sure I like the whole concept of this thing anyway. I mean, its not like these bands aren't awesome on their own. Do we really need to stamp Metallica's now pretty bogus name on a collection of songs that really has nothing to do with them? I don't really understand.Buy a MOTORHEAD CD, and you'll feel a lot better about yourself."
5,Butterfly Photography,"A must book for butterfly enthusiasts. Arrived on time, and in great shape. Thanks!"
1,Perfect for kids,"If you have no background in biology or you are a young child, then this is the perfect guide for you. If, however, you are an informed enthusiast or competent scientist, then you should buy the peterson guide or the kaufman guide, or both."
3,This drummer is unbeleivable,"I thougth the remix of COme to Daddy was awesome, the drummer did such a cool break beat rendition. Pig Latin was great too. Cool album name."
2,Its Weak compared to the old stuff,"Dillinger Escape PLan IS one the best Hardcore bands there is. Their old albums are great but i think this one has turned for the worse. For those who were fans of their old work surely would not like much of this album because of their new singer. The band is still really good but Mike Patton doesnt fit in well with this band compared with their old stuff. for those who knew them for a while and you are looking For something more like Dillingers old stuff, this cd is not for you. you will be dissapointed, trust me. But if your a fan of Mike then you should probably get it. Also for those who dont know them and are looking for something heavy insane hardcore stuff check out their old cds."
2,dissapointed,"i am a huge dillinger fan and this is no where near what i was expecting. the music is great, but i'm not too down with mike patton's vocals. he sounds like the singer from korn, complete with weird noises and everything. i wasn't too happy. i liked calculating infinity a million times better."
1,Boo Urns (if there was a minus 2 stars it would be above),"if you like Korn, Disturbed and Ramstein then buy this CDit is now a coaster in my room......... but it works great to help stop those unpleasant water stains!BOOOOOOO URNS"
5,The best of both worlds?,"At first, when I hear that Patton was going to appear on a DEP release, I became fearful. I had a feeling that like the other recent supergroup-esque records Patton has had a hand in (like the first Fantomas album, the Tomahawk album, and his work with Zorn), this would be just as, well, not so great (Don't get me wrong, I like Fantomas, but it's not half as good as albums by any of the respective members' bands). However, this is wonderful. Not only is the Dillinger Escape Plan up to their old tricks, even without their original vocalist, but their sound is even more progressive (and Bungle-y, I guess you could say)-- often I was wondering whether Trey Spruance had also made a guest appearance on the EP."
4,Chaotic beauty,"I must say this is one of the most beautiful albums I have in my collection of over 275. The technically perfect, artfully crafted musicianship of The Dillenger Escape Plan shines through past a sort of dissapointing (but still great preformance) from Mike Patton (of Faith No More fame.) I would recomend this album to anyone who likes their metal mathmatical and their music hard and heavy."
5,000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,"Mike Patton singing for Dillinger Escape Plan, enough said. This is an amazing collaberation of two pioneering musical forces. Probably the most creative album I have heard this year, next to the new Nursing Home Abuse."
2,made with scraps of leather,"The vest itself is OK, but don't think that you are going to wear this out anywhere for motorcycle events as it is made with scrap pieces of leather and looks like it. Picture does not show the patchwork pattern and it is easily seen as creaselines, but they are seams sewn with a serger stitch and it is quite obtrusive in the tanned finish of the garment. It would work fine for a theater production or anywhere artistic license is appreciated.Amazon should somehow state that is is not made of sheet leather but small pieces. Its not a bad craftwork if that is what you want, but it is the pits if it is not."
3,Misc.Leather Vest XL,"I ordered this for my husband, thought it would fit him, however it didn't fit real good, could have been longer in the body, but it didn't. And wasn't a size XL, looked and fit like a large."
4,Cheap is cheap,If it cost 24 bucks you get that muck quality so wagtails can I tell you go spend your money any
5,excellent product,Perfect price for awesome product.Highly recomended.I use it for my shop andit works great.The price was great for allof it compare to other stores.
5,The people's favorite,One thing I'm struck with while reading all these reviews is that every one of them give S/A 5 stars-and many of them relate this album to a certain point in history-including their own personal history. They are all correct. This is one of the best albums ever made and just might be the best pop album ever made. If you were lucky enough to be a teenager in 1972 and had any taste-this album was most likely the soundtrack of those times. I was 16 years old and fell in and out of love to this album. It will forever hold a special place in my heart.
5,Pop Masterpiece,"Todd Rundgren's SOMETHING/ANYTHING is a pop masterpiece, the sick thing is he did it all by himself. This is the album that propelled him to stardom and he deserved it. Somethin/Anything is an album i tresure. It puts me in such a good mood. A-"
5,Thank You Kingpin...,"well I was watching the movie Kingpin (i recommend) and theres a sequence in which a stunning song's on it... I did'nt know anything about the artist,i was ripping my brains out to find out who was the performer of that masterpiece... I found out it was TODD RUNDGREN (I saw The Light ,yeah boy I did!!!),now i own this CD and i love every single song on it ,it has the power to make you feel good ,even when your don't,There are songs that give you that cheesy smile on your face (you know what I mean) This is an absolutely masterpiece to have in your library (and constantly in your CD player)."
3,Doesn't Age Well,"Loved this album when it first hit the stores. Lost my original 2 disc vinyl in that nasty break-up of 1989. Figured it was a good time to recapture some of my youth and get the CD set.Listening again after all these years my perception of Something/Anything has changed. Yes, the disc contains quite a number of winners. However, 25 years later I found Something/Anything not that different from mainstream rock that was packaged during that era. Technically, TR is great, but the album as a whole fits into that 'Good Stuff but Same Stuff' category.Glad I bought it just for the trip down memory lane.."
3,"Some Wizardry,but only Three Stars","This double album is held up as Rundgren's masterpiece, a singer-songwriter at the peak of his form. And some of the songs fit the bill - I saw the light, It wouldn't have made any difference, wolfman jack - to name the first three cuts on the first CD. But overall Something/Anything, like the name suggests, feels unedited and over-long. Wizard/True Star and Runt are tighter and have more than their share of great songs."
2,Loved it as a teenager -- I guess I've moved on,"""Marlene'. 'Cold Morning Light', 'It wouldn't have made any difference' -- I listened to these songs over and over as teenager. Now in my 40's I figured this album is a must-have, but I brought it back after 2 playings. The lyrics now seem either juvenile or overly sentimental, and the racous ones I wish weren't on the album. I guess I'm looking for more delicious complexity than this."
3,animation and interactivity for the advanced,This book will be a great help to those who have worked with flash before and want to learn the advance parts of flash and plan on using Flash with most of their work or job. The lessons have great content but the beginner will have a hard time understanding the lessons.
4,interesting...,"got this one and the first one ON SALE. the series is famous for starting the modern ninja craze in the movies. and is known for being a great interpretation of real ninjitsu. a good deal on sale, but at regular prices I'd wait. if 3 & 4 ever go on sale I'll get them.not bad."
1,so old that most computer programs cant play the cd,"I have no idea how the game is because the cd program is so outdated that my HP computer will not play it. If you have an ancient working computer it'll possibly work, but it can't be newer than 1997 progams. Very dissappointed. :("
1,worthless,"the most useless item i ever bought , i didnt have any of the china in it that i needed it to have."
4,Davion Rebirth,"I have to say, that I was surprised how many listed Davion units are loyal to Katherine Steiner-Davion. Still, loyalties change all the time in this universe. Despite that, I am sure the book will put at ease those B-Tech fans who think the AFFC/AFFS is no longer as potent as it was during the Succession Wars. Although the Federated Suns is not as up to date as other Inner Sphere powers, certainly they can hold their own in superior organization and tactics.The real question is, even with the resurgence of the Star League and detente with the Draconis Combine, can the Federated Suns, and the Federated Commonwealth survive the sundering of Civil War? This Field Manual will reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the Federated Suns, and with the Lyran manual, ""stack the forces"" together to let readers understand the unsettling future ahead. A must-read."
4,Field Manual: Federated Suns,"Could be better, but overall, it's a GREAT book, with a lot of in-depth information and useful Role-playing info. :)"
4,A Hot Buy,This cd is one of my all-time favorite. I like it because they know how to flow and put their words together and rhyme things that you wouldnt think should normally rhyme. ...buy this CD from Amazon!!!!!
5,Showcase of the D,"If you like Eminem, D-12, Obie Trice, and Royce Da 5'9"", you gotta pick this up. There is almost NO filler on here. The best songs include ""Life"", ""Ecstacy"", and ""Do What I Wanna"", and ""Feels Good"" and ""Take No Shorts"" will grow on you. Support Proof and Dogmatic for real rap, not that commercial [*]."
2,Negative,"This book is mainly a put-down of Elizabeth Taylor, who worked tirelessly to help people with AIDs. She may have been spoiled as a child but she worked very hard in the industry. It isn't easy being a child star, transitioning into a real actress, especially when you are burdened with almost preternatural beauty. Everyone expects nothing but lovliness from a person like Elizabeth. She hated the nick-name ""Liz"" so I should've known from the title of this book that it would be an endless put-down. The author quotes people who said horrible things about her. I far preferred Richard Burton's biography of Elizabeth Taylor. His wasn't a paen to a godess but it was a real, honest look at their lives together. Forget this book! I quit reading it after about 80 pages. I kept hoping for an honest evaluation but it was just one put-down quote after another."
3,How much could he know?,"If he did such great research, which it doesn't seem like, why did he call the book ""Liz""? It is well known that she does not like to be called ""Liz"""
2,Scale is nice but doesn't inculude working batteries,"Scale is nice but doesn't include working batteries. The batteries run out a few days after you get it. My mistake was not returning it, so I purchased new batteries, at the cost of $10.52. A little less than what I paid for the scale."
5,I love it!,"I bought this scale to replace another one, and I loved it from the first time I stepped on to it.The top is slightly convex so it seems to hug my feet and I feel more balanced when I stand on it.The output is large and very easy to read and very accurate.I would reccommend this scale to anyone."
3,No TOC or Index in Kindle Version,"The content organization of the book is pretty good. I purchased the Kindle version for my iPad with the thought that I wouldn't have to carry as many books on a two week trip. Unfortunately, the Kindle version of the book is poor. No table of contents and no index. In a travel book I consider them to be critical."
2,A World Cup Class Disappointment,"Frankly, I was disappointed in this movie. It spends way too much time on the soccer aspect at the expense of fleshing out the father and son so one can understand, especially, the father's behavior. The story is very weak, and even the changes the father makes seem to come out of nowhere. Even more farfetched is when Matthias shows up at the World Cup final and that so inspires his player-hero that he wins the game! There are a lot of much better movies out there, especially if you have to go to the trouble to get a region 2 or multi-region DVD player to watch it."
3,"Very good, until the epilogue.","This the second book in Piers Anthony's Cluster sci-fi series. It expands on the Tarot theme found in the first volume (and also in the Tarot series). This book is one of Anthony's first from almost entirely the female point of view, and he does a good job overall. The action is great, with many plot twists and tense moments. The problem is the epilogue, in which Anthony conducts one of his typical experiments in the psychology of sex. He equates friendship between females with sexual love in a way that turned me off. If you can swallow this, you will love the book. If not, you will be disgusted. If it were not for the epilogue, I would have given it 4 stars."
2,Useless Reference,"I am not an experienced DBA, but mainly a Java developer. However I thought this book would be a useful reference when doing any Oracle related development projects. I was greatly mistaken. Myself, or my colleagues have never found anything useful in it. So if you want a good Oracle reference, I'd look elsewhere!"
2,Shovelware At Its Worst,"I have no idea what the other reviewers of this book are thinking. I feel seriously mislead, and am returning the book for credit. This is shovelware at its worst, a random unedited pile of hacks, thinks, and yawns thrown together without thought, direction or inspiration. It should never have been published. Books like this are what keeps those Giant Computer Book Sale operations in business."
5,* Dim the lights out and enjoy this album !! *,"This has got to be the BEST TRANCE COMPILATIONS ALBUM in 2002. Tiesto's smooth style is the key to all. Each song is blended well in one contagious melodic journey. I am one of those people who dislike monotone trance music which only shows us plenty of boring/useless instrumental sequences. If there's a thing called a perfection, this album has got to be as close to it in any ways !!Listening to Tiesto not only makes us feel uplifted but also soothing. Unlike most of junk trance outhere which often gives us nothing but a headache, Tiesto provides us the exact opposite effect.This album should be owned by any person who likes TRANCE, especially melodic trance. There're songs with words as well as instrumental in it. It's simply BEAUTIFUL. Run to the nearest record store or order it online right away. Peace !!"
5,"Meditative, Uplifting, Energizing","What can I say but, ""Wow!"". I haven't been able to get this CD outta my player. It travels from the car to the house and back again in the morning. It's perfect for meditating, waking up in the morning, unwinding on the drive home after work, and for toe-tappin and head bobbing as it progresses. Tiesto never ceases to amaze in his track selections and arranging. Hear You Now gave me chills and the vocals made me catch my breath. Faith was a good follow-up as I still hadn't caught my breath when this took me further down the intense journey. In My Memory was also spectacular. Mindcircus could only make me smile as the Gabriel And Dresden remix was definitely a complimentary nod to Way Out West on their own incredible piece of work. Armin Van Buuren's Tranceparance is another one to pick up to go along with this one."
4,Wish it was Live,This would be even better listening if it was a LIVE concert like the Live in ADam Magik CD I listen to all the time. There are some sure as fire repeats like the Oakenfold Sunrise that I have heard way too many times on other CDs but somehow Im not bored of it yet. So I would say this is a BUY but not on the list of top 5 all time best ever. That would still reserved for the LIVE in A'dam as well as Van Dykes Politics of Dancing which I still love! Anyway get it I still rate a 4 star on this one.
2,Sponsored by Mattel,"How this guy consistently ranks near the top (or on the top) of the World DJ rankings baffles me. Regardless, he loves what he does, has a massive fan base, plays music that appeals to both genders, and puts on very flashy shows when he tours. A brilliant recipe for success and a substantial income.This album is your standard set from Tiesto. Trance and multiple tracks featuring female vocals. Appealing to the masses (and there is nothing wrong with that) but not appealing for my electronica tastes. I just had to check out a few of his earlier albums after being completely taken aback and impressed by disc 2 of his In Search of Sunrise 5. I wish he would mix up more sets like that. If Tiesto is your DJ and you love his sets, then I'm sure you will love this one too (if you don't already have it).2.5/5 stars"
3,Average,"I would rate this album higher if it had been produced by another DJ, but I consider it to be weak compared to the rest of the ISOS series (as of November 2006). Whereas 4 and 5 have shown Tisto's ability to produce progressive trance albums and 1 and 2 were flawless melodic compilations, this album falls short in both areas.In Search of Sunrise: Panama is weak for several reasons. First off, it is a single CD, hence shorter than the most recent ISOS compilations. Second, the album starts out very slow and stays there up until the very end which is not the case with the other ISOS, which had and have shown Tisto's full spectrum.In all honesty if I would only purchase this album if I was collecting the full series (which I have done already) else I would skip and go for the other four."
1,AS USUAL TIESTO PUTS OUT TRASH!!!!!,"IF YOU LIKE TO SUFFER AND ENJOY TORTURE THEN BUY THIS ALBUM, TIESTO PLEASE I BEG YOU, GO AWAY AND LEAVE US ALL ALONE> The almighty god of the sound of torment gives us one more reason to hate him. Do not be decieved, this album and any other with his name on it will leave you wondering who this fool is!! if you want something nice buy AVB 2006 or DEEP TRANCE produced by water music records."
2,Great tracks Flawed mixing,"Tiesto fails, he picked very nice greats but his mixing skills are sub-par. there are mistakes quick cut offs. sounds like a work in progress rather then a final product. almost had it but needs to spend some more time before poping out another mix cd. people are getting to hyped about this, and it fails to live up to the hype. then again i guess you don't listen for his mixing skills which arn't very good, but just the track selection.."
2,Hello people wake up !!,him and oakey should be best friends. together they will provide all the cheese this world needs.- progressive is the attitude -
1,Prime shipping?,I ordered this item with 2 day prime shipping and should have received it yesterday. However estimated delivery is 4 days later so I'm already unhappy.Amazon violated the terms of my purchase. I would not have ordered it through them and Hires Automotive if I knew I wouldn't receive the item for weekend use.
5,What a Great Bus Book!,"If you have an interest in buses, this is definitely the book for you! It has such an array of photographs, many of very good quality. There's double deckers, a fishbowl on rails, and pictures of UMTA's transbus entries from the 70's. Never knew that in the 90's, Northrup Grumman tried to enter the bus business. Nor did I know that there was a ""non-electrically powered RTS trolley bus"" running in Dayton, Ohio (to clear the wires for the real trolleybuses).The only thing missing from what I can tell is NYCTA's double decker experiment from the 1970's. But overall, this is a fantastic photographic look at American transit buses!"
1,Black and white pics only,"THe pics are in black and white only. Unfortunately, all the buses pretty much look the same in black and white. Judging from the cover you would think the pics would be in color. I ordered the book and had to send it back."
5,Contents,"Living MayaWalter F Morris Jr1987First Edition HardcoverThis book features Maya in a remote area that has had far less influence from modern civilization. The patterns of living and worship weave a unique lifestyle. 125 full color photos, 60 line drawings and two maps. Of particular interest are diagrams of the weaving and embroidery patterns that produce such colorful garments. Text is on a brown, heavy paper, giving a back-to-the-earth feeling, while photos are on high gloss paper. Exquisite book."
4,Truly Married,"Their marriage was eternal magic, a fiery fusion of body and soul. But in one blind moment of betrayal, attorney Fergus Lachlan forfeited Sharon's precious love and lost his paradise on earth.Five hellish years elapsed. Then a bolt come from the blue. Sharon was accused of murder! Could her former husband defend her life and justify his endless love? Their fierce, unstoppable passion flared once more. But was this just a breathless, desperate reprieve? Or truly paradise regained?"
4,Oldie but goodie!,"Since I am a huge fan of Sade, I felt it only appropriate to see what her band could do without her and I was pleasntly surprised! The sound that I love is all over this CD. Calming and soothing sound that lulls you into relaxation mode. Even though this an oldie, it is a goodie!"
4,Sweetback is Sweetness...,"Sweetback is wonderful! It has been in my CD player for years now and for years to come. I have lost it and i did not mind buying it again. It is just one of those CD's that is pure, that you will always enjoy. It has a nice mix of artist on the album and Sade's band is totally wonderful. It is great for chilling and unwinding. I would recommend this on your list of ""Must Have's"" for your Neo-Soul Collection."
4,Sweetback,"An impressive offering from Sade's boys, and the hot single ""You Will Rise"" featuring the mesmerizing songstress Amel Larrieux is the metaphorical icing on the cake.4.3 stars."
3,Pretty Laid Back,I am not sorry I bought this cd but it is a little too laid back for me. This is a soakin' in the bubble bath and readin' a book while listenin' or rainy day stay indoors cd. If you want to take it down a thou you won't go wrong with this cd. My fav- Au Natural with Bahamadia.
4,"...Or ""How we spent our 8-Year Vacation""","Sade's guys discovered after 1992's ""Love Deluxe"" the same thing that the Yellowjackets did when they finished doing session work for Robben Ford--they liked playing together enough to become a real band on their own. There's an interesting lady-rap number called ""Au Natural"" that takes aim at the sexism often found in the male counterpart, but Bahamadia foregoes the temptation to be just as badass as the dudes. Most of the rest of this disc is instrumental, running the gamut from numbers that would make good Sade songs to semi-ambient to the techno/ eastern fusion of ""Arabesque"" to a crossover funk/ jazz that Marcus Miller would approve of. Hey, they had to do something until last year, and I hope The Lady cuts them enough slack to do more of the same as a change of pace."
5,sound of paradise,"This is a very underrated group. THeir music is pure magic dreamy, smooth, soulful, seductive.A great album for ""special"" moments too."
2,It's a Toss up,"This cat Lil E is a cross between The Realest, and Tupac with a southern voice. He's just another Tupac sound a like. Which isn't so good. Even though he do got some nice tacks on this CD, It still not that good of an album. But if you a southern Rap fan, than this a CD that you would get. Other than that, It would be a toss up. The Production is bad, not horrible bad, but bad. If the production was better I'd give it a four, but a two what I gave it. I took one star off for production, one stars off for sounding like Tupac. And one more star just because I just don't like it too muchOVERALL Evaluation: Get it? If you want, but personally I wouldn't."
2,Poor Ticking,I got these about a year ago for a gift. They were quite firm but I figured they would break-in after using them for a while. I put them in pillow protectors before using them. After the first week they had down coming out all over. Little dusty bits and full pcs of down. The more they are used the more dust/down. They are a pain to deal with. I was very unhappy with them. I really wanted a good set of down pillow and this just isn't it.
5,Disney Talking Vanity is So Cute,My daughter (4) thinks she's THE princess now! This is a really cute item and is a great mix of toy and utility. It fits nicely in her room and isn't like many other talking toys... it's actually a pleasant voice and not too loud.I definitely recommend this for all the little princesses out there.
2,JOINING THE RANKS OF DISGRUNTLED PARENT'S,"My 4 year old just had to have this vanity for christmas and because it was the only ""big"" thing she asked for, I got it for her. Even after reading the reviews I thought I would come out unscathed, no such luck! I put it together correctly, made sure everything was tightly connected. It worked perfectly all Christmas Day,my daughter loved it and played with it for about three to four hours, then that was it. Cinderella stopped appearing, the voice recording started running extremely fast, it gives the wrong or no responses when you chose something off the vanity. I promptly took it apart and returned it. Of course they didn't have any in stock, so I got my money back and hopefully my daughter will think Santa forgot to return it since he had to take it back to get ""fixed"". I refuse to spend that money again for such poor workmanship."
2,Do not try!!! Complete headache!!,"Not only did this toy not work, but I had a horrible time trying to get a new one. Nobody carries it any more. They must have realized it was defective and stopped making them. The people at Toy's ""R"" Us were so rude to me. After telling me that they didn't have any, they said the wouldn't even give me store credit to get something that actually works."
2,Falls Over,"This table should have been made by Little Tykes. It falls over if not put standing against a wall. It still tipes a little. It could also say more than what it does, be a little more interactive."
2,help! lost key!,We bought this for our two young daughters for Christmas. Ofcourse the next day our 4 year old ate too many Christmas cookies and was running around the house with the key. I spent 5 hours tearing apart the house and looking for it. The girls are disappointed and I can't seem to find how to contact the co for a new key. I should have spent the money on one that didn't require an unattached key to work! Can anyone help?
2,Bought THREE to get ONE that worked!! Poor quality control!!,"At 10pm on Christmas Eve when we got the vanity put together, we inserted the key. The light flashed, Cinderella appeared, but NO sound. We took apart the mirror and reattached it, and never got Cinderella to appear again OR any sound. My best friend bought one for her daughter and had problems getting Cinderella to appear as well. We went to three different stores (first two were sold out) the day after Christmas to get a replacement (thank you K-mart). FINALLY we found one that worked. Of course, our 4-year-old loves it now that it works, but it is RIDICULOUS that Disney would put out a toy that has a 50%+ failure rate. What a disappointment!!"
4,Please read if you are having problems with this toys,Well my daughter wanted this like every other little girl here. We put it all together and the sound worked but no light at the top or the cinderella appearing in the middle. I went over and read others comments and tried everything. The instructions should be to first put the mirror on. So we took it all apart and started over. We put it flat on a wood floor and pushed in the mirror so it clicked. Before we could not get it to click. And low and behold it worked!!!! Of course there were a few holes that did not line up perfectly so we just used a few longer screws but for the most part it was fine to put together. My daughter is 4 and it was just her size. She loves it and it was level and pretty sturdy. I think again the they is to put in the mirror on first and hear the click. Good luck!!!
1,Advise or help?,I am unhappy with this product. The lights don't work. Cinderella doesn't appear and it doesn't say all the phrases.Only days before Santa is coming what can I do? Our daughter will be unhappy since this was what she was so extited to get.
5,For the Perfect Disney Princess,I purchased this Vanity for my daughter and she loves it. She is amazed everytime that Cinderella magically appears in the mirror. The item is the most durable vanity we have ever purchased. There are several vanities by other companies but they seem very flimsy. This vanity is great. My daughter enjoys picking up all of the pieces (it comes with a lot to play with) and hearing Cinderellas voice.This is perfect for my Disney Princess.
2,UGH! It won't work,"My husband and I spent two hours putting this thing together and we couldn't get the mirror to light up or get Cinderella to appear. We then took it all apart, started over, and still there's no light or magical annoying princess. We followed the directions and there is a tiny tiny gap in the mirror to vanity connection, but still....come on! We even tried a rubber mallet. Curse you Cinderella!!!"
2,Not so good......,"Received this toy for XMAS and did not work out of the box. The lights and sound do not operate. We'll see if the replacement is any better. I would suggest avoiding this product, as it appears the manufacturer does not have good quality control. It is hit or miss if the product will work at all. Also important to mention is that the design and quality of the materials for this toy is fair."
2,we did not like it,This was a cute concept and my daughter was very excited when she got it. Then we opened the box up! The some assembly required was a nighmare. The stool is too small for her to sit on and she weighs 35 pounds! The make up falls out of the holes and the whole thing is not easy to organize for a 4 year old. The clear plastic drawer on top broke after 5 minutes of GENTLE play. The concept was cute but the quality just isn't there.
5,Beautiful and Entertaining,"My daughter is almost 3 and this was her favorite Christmas present by far. Each accessory has its own place, so it's easy to keep organized. My husband was able to put it together fairly easily. I highly recommend."
3,GREAT IMAGINATION TOY,"Santa got this toy for my three year old daughter for christmas. She loves it!! She loves to hear Cinderella talk to her and tell her how to get ready for the ball. Their are a few drawbacks to this toy. I found the screws that come with it are too small, it is also top heavy, make sure you place it against a wall or it will fall over. Another drawback is that if the child loses the key, you will have lost the electronic feature of the toy. (Hince you can no longer see Cinderella appear or have her talk to the child.) Over all a good toy for the imagination, but needs a few more design flaws worked out."
3,we fixed ours.....,"I think the on-off switch's 'travel' is limited by the little window it sticks thru -- I took off the bottom pink plate that hides the connection and such and just wiggled the stuff around. Everything looked fine, but that little switch needs to ride on those 2 plastic pink posts.....just a little 'juke' and i flipped the switch and it turned on. I think the switch was simply unable to get all the way to the true 'on' position.All good now."
2,not as I expected.....,i bought this vaity for my almost 3 yr old daughter.(for me that can hardly put stuff together) its easy to assemble.. BUT the crystal light up and cinderella did not appear. so i brought it back to toys r us to have it replaced.. and just to find out that the new one that they opened..you can barely see cinderalla and the annoying voice repeats itself 10times until you take the key off. its annoying for me but my daughter loves it.
2,Test the mirror before you put it together!!!,"You learn by your mistakes, they say. We bought one, put the whole thing together, only to find the mirror did not light up. Rather than take the whole thing apart to return, we bought another one, took the mirror out of the second and swapped it with the first, put the mirror that wouldn't work back into the replacement box, and returned it, avoiding a lot of work. This thing cost a lot of money, and putting it together was a pain! Do not wait until Christmas Eve to put this one together!"
1,Do Not Buy This Toy!,"My granddaughter wanted one thing for Christmas 2005. She wanted Cinderella's Talking Vanity and then of course you had to buy the interactive styling set to go with it....about $120.00 total for this toy.Out of the box.....it could not be made to work....Christmas Eve we are frantically looking to the other parents who took the time to write to let others know of the same plight....took the thing apart, looked for the ""bent wires"" ...nothing. So, [kid] wakes up to a ""broken toy""....showed it to her grandmother and when asked how it worked....""Santa brought it broken""....out of stock everywhere.....best you can do is return and try to get your money back....not the point. How can Disney and Amazon.com sell something with so many of these with so many problems and then not stand behind them? They should have them lined up in their wearhouses with electronic engineers manning the Vanity Hot line....will never buy a Disney toy again."
1,This toy will dissapoint your child.,"We we went through three of these vanities to get one that would actually work at all. So, we thought that everything would be fine on Christmas morning. But, it stopped working 5 minutes after my daughter started playing with it, and hasn't worked since. There is a connection between the mirror and table top and one between the mirror and the key that need to stay tight...but they just don't. It does not appear that this toy is really designed for kids to play with. It looks pretty and the concept is neat...but we really haven't been able to see it in action at all. You are better off buying a better brand without some of the extra features in order to get a sturdy toy that will last."
1,Disney used to mean something.,"This is the one toy my 4 yr old daughter asked for from Santa. It's dead out of the box. Tomorrow morning I get to try and convince her that Santa is not mad at her and even elves can screw up. Stay very far away from this toy. It is JUNK, and expensive junk at that. As for me, this $70 is the last that Disney will ever recieve from me and my family. With as many bad reviews as this toy has (I should have checked out the reviews before hand.) They know there is a problem with this, yet they allowed it out of the store anyway. TOYSRUS are contempable in my eyes from this point further. Merry Christmas, yeah right... Thanks!"
1,This toy absolutely STINKS!,5 Days before Christmas and it does not work. Should have read the other reviews.Only thing daughter wants for Christmas.Now what?
1,BUYER BEWARE!!,"Both my sister in law and I got these for our girls for Christmas. Hers' doesn't work in the least. Mine, when you can manage to get one of the keys in, Cinderella sounds more like Satan than Cinderella. Neither key makes her face appear and there are no lights. There's supposed to be....but they don't work either. This was a GIGANTIC waste of money!!!"
3,Cute but not what was expected,"This was a very cute gift. The first one was broken when it arrived and AMAZON replaced it in a very quickly. (Thanks!)The replacement had some interesting ""talking"" features activated when the accessories were placed on the table. However, I was disappointed that the ""Talking Cinderalla Vaniity"" didn't tell my niece that she was the ""fairest of them all."" (Did I have the wrong mirror in mind?)"
3,Vanity Table,"This is a cute idea but it just isnt durable enough for my 3 year old. It tips over easily ( on carpet )which I think has contributed to ruining the lighted Cinderella image that appears within the mirror.I have to prop it against the wall. There is good storage for her ""beauty products"", hairbrushes, bows, etc. It was easy to assemble."
2,Not Giving Up!!!,"12:30 AM on Christmas Eve, and I finally got the silly light to work. If you're still having trouble, follow these steps:1. Remove the mirror (I know you've already tried this 5 times)2. Unscrew the top from the legs so you just have the top to push the mirror into.3. Push the mirror down as far as it will go.4. Flip the top over so you're looking at the underside of the top and you will see 2 screws holding a cover over the bottom of the electronic port. (You will also probably see the gap that is keeping you from getting a connection)5. Push down on the cap over the port and you will hear a loud snap (I thought I had really broken it!)6. Try it again, and the lights should work.7. Stay up til dawn putting all the screws back in to attach the legs again!Merry Christmas!Daddy needs a nap!"
3,We Have Lights!!!!,"well it is 1:30 on christmas eve and I too have had trouble with the getting the lights to work on this toy! I found the problem to be the connection between the mirror and the table to be misalligned. If you remove the mirror, there is a black connector coming out of the table. Check to make sure the connector is straight up and down , mine was angled toward the back of the table letting the mirror go all the way down as if it were connected correctly. To fix the problem I angled the connector forward slightly with a screwdriver the I made sure I put the mirror straight down making contact with the connector."
1,Disney HELP! The toy is broke but there are no extras to exchange for,All my 4 year old daughter wanted for Christmas was the Cinderella Talking Vanity. She wants to know why Santa brought her a broken one. You see Cinderella does not appear in the mirror and the voice does not work. We tried to exchange at Toys R Us and they have none in stock. I've looked all over the world and cannot find one anywhere. My 4 year old does not understand why Santa brought her a broken toy and why he just can't fix it! The whole toy is not sturdy and if it were up to me I'd return it for my money back but my daughter wants to keep it. SHAME ON DISNEY!!!!!!
2,Cinderella Magical Talking Vanity- Disney should be ashamed,"My twin 4 yearolds were so excited to see Santa brought them the Cinderella Magical Talking Vanity, BUT LIKE EVERYONE ELSE ON CHRISTIMAS MORNING I PUT BOTH OF THEM TOGETHER AND NOTHING!!!!! I finally got the one to talk but no image and the other won't even come on. Tried everything but still nothing. Try explaining to twin 4 yearold that Santa brought them a broken toy and is not going to fix it. I Called Toy's R US they said put it back in the box and get a refund their out of stock. So I'm left with the choice, get my money back and tell the girls Santa took their presents back or just bend over, take it like a man and tell the girls Santa's not going to fix it. Disney Should be ashamed !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,what a ripoff!!!!!,"As with alot of people had to explain to my 4 year old daughter on christmas morning why it did'nt work out the box. My husband spent 25 minutes putting it together,another 20 minutes taking it apart and putting it back together again. thankfully this was the toy we gave our little girl and not a Santa toy. so only we look bad right now. She is very disappointed that it doesnt work."
1,It's 10:30pm Christmas Eve + it doesn't even work!,Our four year old daughter's ONLY gift she asked for from Santa and it doesn't even work out of the box. We are VERY disappointed. Can't wait to explain this one to her tomorrow morning...
1,Make sure you have ALL parts and test mirror first!!!,"I order this item and my 4 year old girl was so happy. After we put the first one together, we found out that the ""talking"" mirror didn't work so I had to take it apart (which by the way has the smallest screws which are pretty hard to get in). Then we ship this one back and I tested the mirror for the second shippment first. It worked but as I'm an taking everything out the second box I notice that the hand held mirror for vanity is broken and that the main stick (the Cinderella image) is not in the box as well. This toy is not worth all these headaches as it is made of cheap plastic (very easliy broken anyway)!!! Invest you money in a wooden vanity and put some Disney Princess stickers on it."
3,What a dissappointment,"I was immediately against this toy. It was a pain to put together, and in my opinion, very shoddy. But, my daughter loves it, and it's held up for a year so far. I ended up having to edit my original review, I was a little harsh on it. Still not something I think will be around for grandkids, but for the price, not to bad."
2,Poor workmanship,This bird feeder was put together in haste with poor quality wood. The maker scrimped on material for the roof. Small roof with no over-hang does not protect peanuts from the weather. It looks like this was done to accomodate shipping.
3,Works as expected but painful.,"I ordered this stethoscope over the other brands on Amazon because of its higher reviews. I had also read that other scopes were painful in people's ears. The quality of this scope is as expected, but the earpieces are painful to wear for more than a few seconds. That made it difficult for me when I was hunting for a noise in the front end of my car and had to test multiple places. For quality, I like the scope. For comfort, I do not. Ultimately, I'd seek an alternate scope (for comfort reasons) if I were in the market for this product again."
3,it's ok,it's not as great as I thought but it does work. And I am glad I bought it. It does really help crack the shell. But it only cracks it on one side . But if you are always getting stabbed from the shells this does help.
5,A great CD with his more recognizable tunes,"This CD is very accessible to most fairly new Sun Ra fans. It has a number of his often played tunes when he performed live. I have seen him 6 or so times over the years and a couple more with the Arkestra after his passing. With 25 or more of his records, I can highly recommend this one. If you are new to him, also look into the albums with recognizable jazz standards. Usually, the more songs on the CD, the more accessible it will be to the new Sun Ra fan."
5,Providential.,"I'm glad I found this band. I like the ""No Place Like Home"" CD more each time I listen to it. This is a definite buy..... Enjoy them!!"
3,Used,This book had alot of handwriting in it. I have purchased used books before but this one seemed overly used.
3,The Unauthorized Biography .,"I see now how Clifford Irving was able to write the autobiography which proved to be a hoax. And why Hughes denounced it via the phone to the media instead of a personal appearance. He was a demented person by that time, from all reports. But he had led ""the big life"" frequenting the Coconut Grove and hobnobbing with Hollywood people. Coming from Houston, TX, and choosing his suits from Penney's, Woolworth's, and Sears (wearing tennis shoes as a standard), it had to be heady stuff. He had no social graces.The FBI looked through his personal items at the Mayflower Hotel, his residence 2-12-47. Because of his mental illness, he Quarantined himself from the world."
5,An amazing array of music,With such tracks as Troy and Skint this album prepares you for one of the most exciting new blends of sound there is. With relaxed vibes but with tense skillful guitar lines this is a must get album!!
3,Uh..,"Well, the bendable knees were useless because she can't pedal the pedals on the bike. Easy to put her on the bike. She's cute, but has a weird smirk on her face. I'd still get it, because i have a million other dolls to play with. I don't have to use her. I would just use her for a popcorn seller."
2,Whats with the bendable knees?,"I don't have this toy, but my friend saw it. She said it looked weird with the bendable knees. I think the popcorn machine is cool, just not the girl."
5,Product as advertised / seller responsive,The product had not been received after 2 weeks from being shipped so the seller resent another battery. Both batteries arrived about the same time (the first one was postmarked on the day the seller said it was shipped so it must have gotten delayed somewhere in route). The seller was very responsive and professional to the situation and I would definately buy from him again.
2,This makes no sense..,"Most of us bought Season 1 when it was released however many years ago. Then they re-released Season 1 like 1 or 2 years ago (for whatever reason). Now they are releasing 2 different ""best of Season 1"" and now the 24 hour marathon. This is ridiculous and makes absolutely no sense. Just release Seasons 2 and 3 already. Stop doubling up and wasting our time and your money making DVDs the fans don't want to buy."
1,WE WANT THE REST OF THE SERIES!!!!!,I agree with everyone else... just give us seasons two and three!!!! We're waiting!! WE WANT THEM!!! WE'LL BUY THEM!!!!
2,Wow.....,"This looks like a best of all three seasons - after comparing the episodes with the actual list of Episodes on IMDb. I also agree with the other two. I have S1, and would dearly LOVE a complete set of S2 and a complete set of S3, not a mix of all three. Those of us that watched and loved the show, I'm sure would all agree on that. Come out with complete sets of S2 and S3 and yeah - then I'll buy. I had thought about this one until I read the reviews and then did some further checking. Thanks but no thanks on a 8 disc 24 hour Marathon."
1,This has to be a joke??,"We have been waiting over 6 years for Seasons 2 and 3 to be released and they produce this? Where on earth is the logic with this release. This must be the only TV series in history that has not been released in full on DVD. The thing that worries me is that this is going to be a very poor seller and they will use it as a guide to not release S2&3. Whoever is responsible for future releases of this great series, pull your finger out and give the fans what they want!!"
3,ok but not complete!,"I LIVED for this series as a teenager growing up in Texas....riding horses and being of Native American heritage....LOVED IT! I almost died when I saw this boxed set at a large retail store...so in my 40s now, my mom giggled and bought it for me for Christmas.....imagine my surprise when it is NOT the entire series (which shouldn't a box set be ALL of them??) There are bloopers in the editing (spots will replay as if you hit rewind!) and blank spots where a commercial would have been...just really crappy editing!I KNOW that us die hards would kill for a NICE box set of ALL of the season! WHY not just do the series justice and release them already! This is an ok compilation...but it would be nice if it were A: complete and B: in order!!!Just my 2 cents worth....."
1,Yea,"All I have to say is, SERIOUSLY?? Who are the idiots releasing these, my feelings are shared with the other reviewers."
1,the young riders 24 hour marathon,we want seasons 2 and 3. what is the big hold up? I think everyone would be more than happy to pay top dollar for the whole set.
2,"This is ridiculous, but.....","Unfortunately, fans are in a conundrum with this ridiculous release. We all want seasons 2 and 3 released in their entirety. We don't really want to buy this hodge-podge, but the fact of the matter is....if we don't buy it, the powers that be will say ""see, nobody cares about this show - why should we release seasons 2 and 3?""The only way to get seasons 2 and 3 released is to buy stupid releases like this. So, I'm torn. I don't wanna waste the money. Then again, I would love to see (and own) season 2 and 3 episodes that I've not seen in years...and I want to convince these idiots that complete season 2 and 3 releases are worth doing...still pondering whether or not to buy...."
2,Author mistakes convolution for insight,"While the book does a reasonable job of tackling the subject matter, the author overuses compound sentences. Rather than clearly stating his points, the author loses his readers in a flurry of poorly constructed sentences and lists of names. I would recommend finding a more concise read with fewer unnecessary and repetitive words."
2,What has Odom done to Argent?,"The plot elements were great, but the execution of these elements were poor, especially considering Mel's previous Shadowrun work. I guess the first problem was utilizing one of Nigel Findley's (RIP) most famous characters in a manner unlike before. He became a munchkinous character with too much coincidental training and unnecessary cyber for a character like he was before. Also, the irony of his mentor's situation was fantastic, but fairly useless and kind of stupid."
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz... Not so good!,I love the shadowrun books. I got hooked when i was going through some old books of my dads and found the first three shadowrun books. They looked good so I read them. They have kept me on the edge of my seat but this time I fell off of my seat because it was so boring. I couldn't finish the book!
3,S'okay...,"For there to be only 7 songs of instrumentals, I must say that this is really okay stuff. I didn't get into it too much so don't have too much to write. Besides there are no lyrics. But nevertheless, the music is fair, a bit too Country for my tastes though.Best track (to me):Vinyl FeverBasically, if you like tripped out Country music, you just might like this."
3,Not their best effort,Guess I'm just spoiled by Yankee Stadium - which seems to contain all of their BEST work!Perhaps they should renamed that CD: NRBQ's Greatest Hits?
5,These stories embody what writing is meant to be.,"Doris Betts has written a group of stories peopled with all of us. Faced with their own ""ordinariness,"" and their recognition of what they could be if only they knew how to get there from here, Doris Betts' characters charm us and break our hearts. Ms. Betts has done it again; she does it every time. Brava!"
2,Choppy playback,"The audio and video was clear on this Glee episode, but the video kept stopping. The audio would continue when the video froze on a screen so it was like watching still photos with the sound from the show playing. One time it froze on one screen and wouldn't move on so we had to start it over. I gave it 2 stars because we were at least able to hear the entire show so we didn't miss any plot points in the series since they didn't replay the ""Funk"" episode during the summer reruns."
4,great musical series,I think the series brings back talent to the screen that we don't see much of any more. What a delight to see sucha variety of music covered in modern themes. Unfortunately the third disc won't play so I won't be able to watch those episodes. But the order and delivery where painless and quick. It will be a treasure to have for years.
2,Not worth cost,This set is not worth the additional cost of the Season 1 set. All you really get in addition is a journal. No extra features.
4,"Good, but missing something.....","I loved that I got GLEE for so cheap, but when it arrived it was MISSING THE SPECIAL FEATURES DVD. And I know for certain it isn't on a part of the episode DVDs- because there was a missing place in the case. So I didn't get what I fully paid for, but then again I don't entirely care for the special features. I can get them from my friend... but still.... for those that want this the dvds are fine minus the MISSING dvd. the quality is good and like new and everything. :P"
3,DVD has some anomalies,"I love the show but the quality of the DVDs are sub-par. I haven't noticed the sync-ing issues but I will definitely take a look at that as I am sure I will be watching the season over again.My issue is with DVD #6. The second episode on the disk ""Dream On"" skipped multiple times and the last episode ""Theatricality"" completely froze at 5:39. It took over 10 minutes to unfreeze; the time on the Blu-ray player counter was jumping between 5:39 and 8 minutes and change until it unfroze. The freezing continued throughout the first 15 minutes of the episode. After that the episode was fine. I checked the disk and there are no scratches on it."
5,My daughter loved it,I have been watching the Glee series from the beginning and thought it was entertaining and that my daughter might like them. She got the first season on DVD and she hasn't been able to stop watching.
5,Great.,For Christmas my aunt gave me the second season of glee. So I bought the first season and I LOVED IT!
4,Suprising,I didn't expect that I would enjoy this but I did. The humor takes a light look at the social interactions between the clicks.
5,such glee from Glee!,I purchased this dvd configuration for my partner as a birthday gift and not only was I happy with the savings I received here but he was happy with the great quality and of course the content too!
5,glee!,"I was very happy with the DVD set I recieved. It was in perfect condition, and I got it nearly a week before I was expecting it to come, which I was very happy about. Plus, Glee is just awesome :)"
3,Amusing to watch.,"If you like the show and want to know a little more back story, this is a good watch. Be warned, however, it's very obviously one of those hastily assembled behind-the-scenes deals with low production values of its own."
1,will not play on Sharp Aquos BD Players,None of the discs will play on my SHARP AQUOS BD HP 21I had never had trouble with this player so if you have it don`t buy this product.What a rip off!!
1,There will be a Glee Volume 2 :Road to Regionals,Just so everyone knows there will be a Season 1 Volume 2 Glee:Road to Regionals release but it won't be out until 9/13/10. I saw this on a Glee website but I don't know how much it will cost so everybody can relax.
1,Not the product but the service,"Can't rate this item because I never received it! This is due to the terrible delivery service (not) provided by UPS and the awful follow-up by Amazon. After 6 telephone calls (long distance!) it was still never delivered. I am extremely disappointed and angry at this. It is now more than 1 month later and I have still not received a refund, either!"
1,Volume 2?! Cover?! Extras?! Common Fox!,"THE SHOW GETS 5 STARS!!!!!I am all for a Blu-Ray release of Glee. It is a wonderful, original and fun show and I love it!But...1. A lot of people feel they should also release a DVD copy of the second half of the season for those customers who bought the first half as Season 1 Volume 1. I mean, what's the point of naming a product Volume 1 if you're not going to put out a Volume 2. That's just poor form Fox!2. What's with the cover?!!! Where are the kids? Rachel and Finn are nice and all but where's the GLEE CLUB? Kurt?! Mercedes? Tina? Artie? Even Puck and Quinn?!!!3. The extras leave a lot to be desired. More commentaries?! I know they are overworking those kids but maybe they could have postponed this release until they could put out something that would satisfy the rabid fans they have created.Customers like me who are looking for a quality product will definitely be put off by this kind of release. A shame really because this is a FANTASTIC SHOW."
1,Where is volume 2?????,I just recently bought Glee the first season vol 1. obviously insinuating that there will be a vol 2. Where is it? NO! I get an e-mail stating I can pay over $40 for the complete season. NO THANK YOU!! What a rip off!! I am not paying for the same episodes twice. Anyone who bought vol 1 should be given the option to buy vol 2 to complete the first season without sinking over $60 into it and having duplicate episodes!!! Completely misleading!! If I had known the Complete season was coming out and there was not going to be a vol 2 I would have never bought vol 1. Guess they knew that and needed to get rid of them somehow....
3,Good video but fake,"These dvd's worked great and I got to see the whole season, but the cover and box were not original. It looked like it was printed off a computer. I don't know if it was pirated or not."
5,AWESOME!,"Love, love, love this show. Really wanted to hate it so bad but after the first 10 minutes I was hooked. I owned all the episodes on iTunes but I wanted all the special features. Totally worth the money. The first half, what was Volume 1 the special features aren't great but the last half or Volume 2 really make up for it. Season 2 on DVD should be just that much better. Can't wait."
1,Rip off,"I purchased ""Volume 1"" like a lot of people did, and I too feel ripped off. Unless they release a Volume 2 at a REASONABLE price (not inflated because they went through the trouble of correcting this), I will not purchase another Glee product. Or maybe I will wait a few years and get someone's used copy at a much reduced price, as long as it isn't Fox getting my money."
1,Studio Greed Attempts to Force Fans into Re-Buying What They already Own!,"Knowing that ""Road to Regionals"" (season finale for season 1) will be aired next week, I went on-line to find the release date of Glee Season 1 Vol. 2. Imagine my disgust when I found out that there will be no Season 1 Vol 2 release, but that Gleeks were expected to buy the 1st 13 episodes all over again just for the privilage to get the remaining 9 episodes! Well, not for me! I refuse to give into studio greed by re-purchasing something that I already own 60% off. If worse comes to worse, I will wait until I find the item used and buy it from a second party so that 20th Century Fox gets NOTHING from me!!!! In addition, I will minimize spending my money on all DVD and movie tickets for FOX films and I urge other fans to do the same. The fans must ban together to stop corporate greed. I hope that Amazon has the courage to print this review since I buy over 100 items a year from this website."
1,Annoyed,"I am livid that there is no season 1 volume 2 to go with my season 1 volume 1 which I thought was the entire first season. It is bad enough that I have to buy all the cds separately and then pay $1.29 for all the songs they do not include on them, but now I have to pay an additional $40 to get the rest of the first season? It it rather ridiculous and they should really make a volume 2 dvd."
1,SO not fair,"I have to chime in with the others I knew that when I purchased the first DVD set for my sisters for christmas that it was part one, and that it wasn't the entire season. Now you are choosing to not release just part 2 of season one, but you are going to release the entire season? Relaly not okay. Terrible customer service. YOu know that people will buy part 2 if they already purchased part one.Come on people, just not okay.Oh, and if you think that people are over-reacting because you plan to release season one part 2, then don't make announcements like this. Just stupid. Terrible."
1,amazon failure,"amazon has failed to send the item and i have now been waiting a month.money is paid and still no parcel.WILL NOT BUY OFF HERE AGAIN, WANTS MOENY REFUND!"
2,not the complete season!,"How can you call this the Complete First Season when there were 22 episodes, starting with #1 the ""Pilot"" May 19, 2009 and ending with #22 ""Journey"" on June 8, 2010? This shows only 13. That is considered part one at my video store. The complete season should have all 22 episodes on it! Not a good deal and marked incorrectly, if you ask me!"
1,Great Video - No Sound on TiVo,"iTunes was being super slow and since I had a promotion code for Amazon I thought I would try it out. Amazon is much faster than iTunes tonight, but, there is no sound. After some troubleshooting, restarting the TiVo and everything, still nothing. Glad it was just a promo code I wasted."
2,Great but scratched,I love Glee and I am a (not gay) 13 year old.I am pleased to say that everything was great until I looked at disc one.I looked at everything and now I noticed that the back of disc one there is a huge scratched circle.I wish I could contact the seller but no.There is no way to contact seller.I would not recommend buying from this seller.
5,BLU-RAY: FINALY YES!!!,"I've been wishing it would come out on blu-ray... as far as 5 stars, that is also for the BRILLIANT Comedy/Music/Drama show ever. ;)I'll be watching it MANY times. How about you?As for the others who bought Season 1 PART 1, I hope they work something out for you all. I didn't buy it because it said part 1, and I hoped for the Blu-ray, and here it is just as I hoped. Good luck to you guys, I do hope they give a really good discount for the other Loyal fans who bought that first season part 1 DVD."
2,Glee Season 1,"The bonus dvd skips a lot as did other episodes on other discs. Very disappointed in this purchase, especially since I think I purchased a ""new"" set."
3,"One disk bad, balance okay.","The story is entertaining and rates 3 or 4 stars. However, the first disk was bad because the video and the soundtrack were not in sync. The other disks were fine. If the first disk wasn't bad, the blu-ray package would rate four stars."
3,Lip Sync Issues,"I have the DVD version of the Complete First Season, and there are serious issues with lip synchronization on several episodes. This happens not just during the singing, but throughout the entire episode. It makes watching the episode almost painful. Very disappointing."
2,Frustrating,"Some discs would not play on my t.v. I had to view them on my computer. \Some discs had flaws, interruptions during the play time. Frustrating. I may return this item."
5,I love Glee,I love the actors and storylines. It's a very unique show that addresses some real issues. I would like some of the bullying and inappropriate relationships addressed more realistically.
4,"Ok, but one good song","I generally don't like this episode but there is in my opinion one good song. ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" sung by Mr. Schuster & Puck is amazing. Bohemian Rhapsody by Vocal Adrenaline is OK, but I never have liked that song much. The episode includes funny and touching part by Sue but the songs by Finn and Rachel are not that great though."
5,Gleeked Over Glee: The Complete First Season,"An absolute must-have for every Glee fan, of which I am not ashamed to admit being one. I especially liked the Jukebox extras so I could rewatch some of my favorite song performances. The auditions were immensely entertaining,as well as the interviews with some of the actors. This collection was worth the wait. I would have liked to see interviews with Madonna and other icons who inspired some of the episodes to get their take on what the show has, or has not, done for their careers, as I understand Madonna's record sales took off again after the episode that featured her music and the wildly entertaining re-make of Vogue, featuring Sue Sylvester."
5,Love it!,Love it love it love it!!It shipped super fast! And as soon as I got it my friends came over to watch with me!Glee is a great show!
4,Fun and Exciting,"I love Glee. I think is a great turning point in TV history. A successfull Musical tv show, with music that the family enjoys."
3,Something amiss,"While I enjoyed the show TO A DEGREE, what made me tune out was the it was all a a bit too ""High School Musical"" - like a whitebread version of the original ""Fame"" series which at least had some reality and grit to it. The other thing that turned me off was that the supposedly ""live"" glee club performances sounded overly produced - even the rehearsals."
2,Where's The Second Half??,"Like many, I bought the first volume of Season 1 and now will wait for the - SECOND VOLUME of season one - forever apparently (???) - oh well - I can wait"
2,Shame on You - FOX,"If FOX was wise to their loyal audience they would have two releases, this complete first season release for those that have not yet gotten into GLEE, and the 2nd part of season 1 for those that have bought the first part and have been GLEE fans from the beginning. Being a GLEEK does not make me a GEEK or a SUCKER."
5,First timer,"I had heard a lot of comments about Glee, but never watched it. I watched all of season I and found it quite entertaining. I liked the music and how sometimes the singing would morph into a ""music video"". The casting is good."
3,Great - but not the director's cut I remember,"Glee is a great show and this episode sets the tone for the series.But I don't think this is the same editing as the ""director's cut"" I saw on DVD a couple of months back.It seems like the editing, especially early in this episode, is very choppy and condensed. And there is one specific thing I remember from the DVD that is not in this. When Shue goes to the football team and is addressing them, most of his talk is deleted. I remember Puck telling Shue that he could sing, offers to show him, and then flatulates. This is not in this version. It seems to me a lot of stuff was deleted, especially in the early part of the episode.Caveat Emptor - or buy the DVD version."
4,Gleeful glee,"Unexpected was that the bonus features are actually interesting, but somewhat lacking in major substance. Many of them have been available on the Internet for free, and the ones that I havnt seen are a bit small. Matthew Morrison, who plays the lead, doesn't show up in any of the bonus clips. More information about the show's origins and the actors would have been nice, considering the size and scope of the product. time to load -- about 2 minutes on my player -- and selecting each show or bonus feature brings an additional wait time of about a half a minute before it begins. I have some slow-loading Blu-rays in my collection, but this one takes the cake."
5,love the show now can watch favorite episodes,"Get yours too and have a Glee parties with your friends. This is the complete second season, careful as you select which version you are getting."
4,Start from the beginning,"Glee is a great show - sassy and unapologetic, with outrageous characters and fantastic covers. I am not a fan of cover songs myself, but I love almost every song Glee does as much if not more than the originals. As a big Journey fan, I think they rock Journey songs, as they do many of the other artists they take on. The guest stars are a bonus treat. You should start at the beginning, as Season 1 was fantastic with the most honest take on each of the characters that we'll ever see."
5,My Granddaughter is a Gleek!,"I bought this for my Granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it, it is the perfect gift for a Gleek!"
3,Good,"My mom bought this. It came pretty quickly, and works well. No damage to the discs, and for a Glee fan, it's perfect."
2,This series is much different during the season than the pilot . . . IMO a 4 to a 2 star.,"I love the high school kids, I love the music . . . so much I found my eyes misting up. Ya . . . and I want them to win the Glee Club competition sooooo much.I've fallen in love . . .Hey . . . I'm a vet, I love military history, The Alien Trilogy, The Terminator Trilogy and Battlestar Galactica. I want to see the wall pasted with the bad guys.Can this really be happening . . . :)Note: At this moment I am pretty disappointed. I cancelled my subscription to Glee . . . the pilot was definitely a 4 star in my book. But the following series went downhill, IMO. The music changed, the plot seemed to get muddled and uninteresting. But especially the music . . . totally different. Mostly an obscure collection of semi-modern lyrical. Just disappointing"
3,Review to not review,"I do not remember ordering this. So in fairness and I will try no to insult the dedicates, I will say I'm pretty sure its ok. This was probably a free be."
5,Awesome!,"best bluray and season of glee evereverything came just as promisedlove glee, love amazon =Dlooking forward to second and third season"
5,christmas gift for my son.......,Scooby-Doo's Original Mysteries...Glee: The Complete First Season...just so happy love it own all the seasons...a real pick me up series!~
5,A great start to a great series!,"I was very impressed with the quality of production, and the choice of music. All the actors are very convincing in their roles, especially Jane Lynch."
5,outstanding,i was late finding out just how GOOD this series was/is. Watching it now i was crying tears of joys at how very excellent it all comes together. If only real high schools had glee clubs like this one
4,DVD Clarifications,"For those who originally purchased the first part of season 1 in ""Glee Season 1, Vol. 1 - The Road to Sectionals"", you have a couple of options. You can either order ""Glee Season 1, Vol. 2 - The Road to Regionals"" (also currently available for pre-order on Amazon) or Fox has also offered a $10 coupon for you.I believe the idea behind Fox releasing only the first part of season 1 had to do with the long mid-season break. People were eager to have their DVDs for all those months they spent waiting, but Fox couldn't very well sell them unaired episodes.Other than that, this DVD set looks like it's going to be great!"
5,Fabulous Glee!,The music--fabulous. The acting--great. The theme--the best. Will be watching and waiting for more. Turning away from the almighty dollar to do what makes one truly happy is more than a goal: It is inspiration.
5,Absolutely worth every Dollar and Cent!,"When the first dvd volume of glee came out I rushed out an brought it not caring that it wasn't blu-ray. Do I wish I waited, honestly it's not that important to me now, what is important is that this complete 1st season has great quality in terms of the videos and blu-ray feature extras. All 22 episodes are available from both the original SD dvd volumes. I urge all of you out there wondering weather or not to buy this to go ahead and do so, you won't regret it!"
5,"First season, best season","I bought this set two years ago as a bunco gift for my girlfriends. Amazon temporarily had an AMAZiNGLY low cost on it. My friends were thrilled. The quality of the DVDs is great, and the story line and musical numbers are so wonderful that I would (and have) watched episodes multiple times. Keep an eye on the price and when it dips, snatch it up! It's good stuff. I will say, though, that if you're buying it for the special features, you might be disappointed. I wasn't impressed with them but YMMV (your mileage may vary). Buy them for the great episodes they are, and because Cory Monteith is a cutie. There. I said it.P.S. Amazon tip: Put items you know you want to buy, but are waiting for the price to drop, in your shopping cart. Then view shopping cart and click ""save for later."" When you do this, every time you go to your shopping cart after that, you will receive a pop-up announcing any price changes on your items."
5,Awesome,I was wanting all the seasons of Glee. This was the first to buy really good at a pretty good price.
1,Defective DVDs,"Hold on to your Amazon shipping label and box. Only three or four of the seven-disc set can actually be played on my DVD player or computer. I like the show itself, but the packaging and production of the DVDs is of very poor quality. Be prepared to send them back."
5,Satisfied Customer!,I purchased this product on black Friday for an amazing deal! I was told my purchase would not arrive untill after Christmas. However the product arrived 2 weeks before Christmas!
1,This Show is so overrated!!,Not that many people like this show and i got a digital copy of it from my friend on iTunes. I guess it's ok that they are making it all one season available and if you have to buy it get the Blue Ray version less disc more quality Blue Ray is great. I've seen several episodes and find it very annoying some of the individuals. The song choices are ok but you can;t get what you want. A lot of show tunes nothing really that great and amazing or recent. Single ladies is an annoying song. If you like great Fox shows pass this one as Birds of Prey was even better.
1,GLEE season one - no sound,"Well, I love Glee. BUT the DVDs I received were malfunctioning. The sound totally dies out on the second disc. As well as the third, etc. I've given up on them. I am further disappointed that I was unable to contact the seller to get a refund. If the seller reads this, please contact me about a refund."
5,Read The Fine Print This is Blu Ray not regular DVD,"This full season set is not the regular dvd but rather Blu Ray edition, so most likely they will put out the regular season dvd volume 2 so everyone should try to calm down and wait and see. I also bought volume one not even thinking they would ever put this out on Blu Ray. What a great surprise! I watch this show every week. Went through withdrawal from December until the return in April. Hopefully Fox will sign it up for a second season!!"
4,Comedies about strange FAMILIES are always the best!,"This film goes straight into my HALL OF COMEDY FAME, along with American Pie, Hollywood Zap, and Dumb and Dumber.Ben Stiller is undoubtedly one of the best young comedians in America today. He is America's favorite nerd, so if you love nerds, then this film is a must-see."
1,One of my least favorite movies of all time.,"I know a lot of people thought this was a lighthearted romp, but watching it made me so upset and angry I was had trouble getting to sleep for days afterwards. When I see Ben Stiller sell himself short in such a cliched, self-hating-jew stereotype, it makes me cringe, but that's not the real reason I disliked the movie (and the entire genre it represents so well).When someone in an awkward situation lies to try to make it better, then lies to cover up the lie, then continues in greater and greater contortions to try to preserve their illusion of social conformity, it's presented as funny. But to me, it isn't. It's a tragedy, and it's a tragedy reflected in our daily lives as a society.This movie reminds me of everything I dislike about shallow social convention, and about people who subscribe to it and who desperately crave the approval of others. No laugh track, no acrobatically awkward pratfall, could make me find that funny."
2,ok,not a great movie at all - just worth practicing guitar along. Has some good moments and a happy ending and predictable lines but that's about all.
2,Pretty bad.,"Meet the Parents starring Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller is not that funny or original. Blythe Danner is pretty good in this but Teri Polo is one horrible actress, she's so lame and wooden. I have never been a Stiller fan but his chemistry with De Niro makes this movie not so dreadful. I don't why but I saw the sequel to this film a few years ago I enjoyed that one more than this. The jokes are somewhat crude but if you like those kind of comdies than this film is for you."
5,Still Laughing!,"This is one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time. It follows the story of Greg Focker (""just like it's spelled"" hehe) and his struggle to fit into his girlfriend's family. He decides to ""Meet the Parents"" to ask if he can marry their daughter, but a twist of hilarious events leads to a great plot and darn funny movie!Favorite quotes from this film:""Well, if you're going to have little Fockers running around...""""You didn't tell me much about your cat-milking days in Motown.""""That was a lot of.... information.""""They'd have to be interesting people, right? To name their son Gaylord Focker?""Caught your interest? Thought so. Now BUY THIS FILM!"
3,It Was OK.....,"I was so anxious to see this movie, and unfortunately, I was disappointed. I felt that all of the funniest scenes of the movie were shown in the trailers. Robert DeNiro was great, as was Ben Stiller, but I feel the trailers gave too much away.I would not recommend even renting this movie, wait for cable TV."
1,They were tryiing too hard,"You care about someone and you want to make a good impression on the people that matter to them even if that means you've got to lie or not be yourself to do it. It's a common enough theme and a great source of comedy, but neither my husband or I found much to laugh about. The joke about the last name was tired. Everything just seemed strained and depressing. We gave up halfway into the film and found something else to watch."
2,disapointment,"i suprised not to find this movie very funny,Deniro was as always good, but could not fined a bone in my body that would help me like the family of his lovely girlfriend.There snobs and very anoying for this film.They should have had the family be more likeable. American Pie and Theres soming about Mary was alot funnier....rent this one first"
1,Irritating and only occasionally funny,"I was very dissapointed with this movie. I found that Ben Stiller was very annoying as well as all of the other characters. Most of the time we sat there with a flat face and just kept looking at each other wondering how this movie got recommended to us. I enjoyed Deuce Bigalow and other 'dumb' movies. This movie was simply not funny and actually irritating most of the time. I'm Selling my copy to EBAY that's how much I don't like this movie as it has no rewatchability. I am very easy to please and RARELY sell any of my DVDs on EBAY because I like to collect DVD's, but this movie has no merits."
4,A big hit from De Niro & Stiller,"This is a big one from both De Niro and Stiller! De Niro, especially, knows how to blend well in a comedy: he's been parodied numerous times, but to see him in an actual comedy works even better. The rest of the cast makes it all the more engrossing. This will certainly bring big laughs and even bigger hearts."
1,De Niro's Worst Movie,"Another Dream Work's dog... Meet the Parents is forced, boring, and just plain not funny.As a big fan of De Niro, I expected a certain level of entertainment, but this movie was rancid. The script was boring, background music grinding, and acting horrid. Could they have made the audience suffer more? Luckily it was only 100 minutes.An actor of De Niro's capability really should not associate his name with such projects...."
3,Funny Movie,"Great fun to watch. Two scenes, the cremation jar and the Airport are one of the funniest. Gave it only 3 stars as it was to long an entry into the fun part."
2,Two stars for two scenes that where funny.,"That's right, there are only two scenes in this whole long boring movie that where funny. My wife and I wanted to rent a comedy and heard that Meet the Parents was a great comedy. I guess people will laugh at anything really stupid, which this movie is; very stupid and not very funny. The best scene, by far, is when Ben Stiller is on the roof trying to get the cat and what happens after that. That's it. Typical Hollywood ending too. Very disappointed. After this movie my wife and I watched Charlie's angels which (I can't believe I'm saying this) was a much funnier and more enjoyable movie. Meet the parents also dragged a lot. A lot of the scenes could have been shorter and funnier. I just don't understand what people are laughing about when they watch this movie."
3,Pretty funny movie.,"This is the story of Greg Focker(Ben Stiller) who (as the title suggests) meets his girlfriend's parents(Robert Deniro plays her father;he's an ex-CIA agent). Instead of focusing on outright comedy, it tries a mors subtle approach. It creates awkward situations and makes you feel for our unfortunate hero. Ben Stiller is great, but Robert DeNiro steals the show."
3,Over-hyped,"When this film hit the theaters, a lot of people I know made it out to be the funniest thing in a long time. So after renting the film I'm sorry to say that I just don't see it.It had it's funny moments, but it seemed to get more boring as it went along. Some of the jokes were really funny, but others were just lame.I mean most of us have been in Stiller's shoes at one time or another. And I have to say that not even the biggest loser wimp that I know would have put up with some of that treatment. Sometimes I just didn't find the abuse he took was funny. ..."
1,No wonder this movie bombed in the theaters!!,"Don't get fooled by the snappy trailer ... this is one unfunny film. You're going to get suckered by the Stiller / De Niro billing, but you're in for a major disappointment. Like the characters in the film, MTP is stiff, dry, even painful to watch.I still can't get over how the trailer set up my expectations. Shame on the Hollywood marketing machine for duping the general public. This movie bombed in the theaters, and deservedly so."
1,No redeeming quality...,"When I saw this movie the first time, I saw no humor. However, I was subjected to this film four more times that week, due to some unusual circumstances, and it was only then did I truly come to despise it.The story is Ben Stiller meets girl. They fall in love, and then Stiller has to meet her parents. The humor is reliant on the fact that people find it humorous that the hopeful husband-to-be always gets everything wrong. However, it's just not funny. DeNiro, although playing an interesting new character as father of the bride, does not add to this, already mess of a film.Stiller can be funny, but bathroom humor and slapstick can only go so far. If that's you're thing, then you'll like it, otherwise just stay away.(The only good thing is that the sequel is ok, but that's a different review.)"
2,"Funny First Half, Then Runs Out of Steam","I really liked the first half of this movie. Stiller and De Niro are very funny. My favorite scene: the dinner where De Niro reads the poem about his mother that ends with the cat using her ashes for a litter box! My favorite line: ""I have nipples, Greg, would you like to milk me?""But about two-thirds of the way through, the movie felt like it was just Piling It On the Stiller character. When Stiller actively deceives his future in-laws about losing their cat, I lost a lot of sympathy for him and really didn't care how it turned out."
1,The parents are not worth meeting,"It was supposed to be so funny. An hour into it, I was still waiting to laugh. The plot was predictable. The characters were made of the cheapest cardboard. I wound up thinking, ""none of these people are worth what Stiller's character is going through."" Least of all, the complete whelp of a fiancee who was dishonest, weak-willed and insensitive. The funny moments can all be viewed in the trailer. Beyond that, it's just difficult to watch.I really like Ben Stiller and I love Blythe Danner. But DeNiro should be totally ashamed. Totally ashamed."
3,Why you shouldn't visit the in-laws.,"Greg Focker is completely in love with Pam Byrnes and plans to use the trip to her parents' house on Long Island to ask her to marry him. Once Greg is introduced to Pam's parents, however, things stampede steadily downhill. Pam's father Jack takes an instant and obvious dislike to his daughter's boyfriend, making fun of his job as a nurse and generally making Greg painfully aware of the differences between him and Pam's family. Where Greg is relatively unambitious, and Jewish, Pam comes from a long line of well-mannered, blue-blooded WASPs. Things go from bad to worse, with Greg incurring the wrath of both Pam's father, who worked for the CIA for 34 years, and the rest of her family, and almost single-handedly destroying their house and the wedding of Pam's sister."
3,"Funny, but not Ha Ha Funny","I think the marketing of this movie cost it in that its a funny movie, but its not the side-splitting followup to ""Something About Mary"" that it was at times billed as.It's average for this genre, which, if you enjoy it, makes it worth watching, but likely not worth owning."
1,Come on De Niro?,"Why you waste the comic brilliance of Robert De Niro on such a ludicrous and unfunny comedy is beyond me. People will watch him in MEET THE PARENTS and laugh at his humor, but when it comes to seeing his good performances in GOODFELLAS and TAXI DRIVER they act like those films are no good. ANALYZE THIS is much funnier and more inventive...so watch it instead."
1,Don't Bother,"I didn't laugh once. There isn't a sympathetic character in the film, with the possible exception of Blythe Danner's. The actors deserved a better script, a better director, or agent's who knew when to say ""no"". Don't bother renting it, buying it, or wasting your time seeing someone else's copy."
1,Stupid waste of De Niro's talent.,Robert De Niro must have had to payoff some gambling debts! The was not funny! The scenes were pre-fabricated and forced. Pure plastic.De Niro should be ashamed of the film and his sophomoric performance. His talent would be better served on other projects.
1,mactheknife,"Alot of hype, not a great movie. The comedic aspects were so-so. De Niro is great but Stiller is painful as an out-of-step soon to be son-in-law. I'm not sure where all the hub-bub about this movie comes from. Way over-rated."
2,we are not amused,I had heard several people say this DVD had them rolling with laughter so I was expecting alot. I was mildy amused...intermittently. The plot was rather predictable with lots of slapstick humor. There was nothing new or fresh about the story or the presentation. I wouldn't buy it again.
1,Skip it unless you're an under-25 male!,"Stupid! Unfunny! Lots of toilet humor! Ben Stiller's character is such a totally pathetic loser that it is COMPLETELY ridiculous and implausible that a gorgeous woman like Teri Polo would be interested in him -- not to mention continue to love him after he's made an utter fool of himself for an entire weekend and torpedoed her sister's wedding! Not as horrible as ""Something About Mary"" -- which we turned off after the famous ""hair gel"" scene -- but strictly for brainless adolescent males."
2,Not so funny as I thought...,"Ben Stiller plays a lovesick male nurse who wants to ask his love (Teri Polo)'s father (Robert De Niro)'s permission to marry her. Silly hijinks ensue, but not as funny as I thought as it was in the preview. Some cute moments, but doesn't produce genuine laughs, or at least chuckles, which the show ""Friends"" almost always does. But ""Meet The Parents"" just wasn't funny enough, but it's worth a look at, and it garnered an Oscar nomination for best song, Randy Newman's ""A Fool In Love,"" so if a movie has garnered an Oscar Nomination for best song or whatever minor (such as best costuming, etc.), best if you stay away (I only watched it on VHS three times). You may ending up hating it as well as wasting your money buying it. Hopefully the sequel will live up more than its predessor. Rated PG-13 for language and some very mild ... content (as well as seeing Ben Stiller in a skimpy Speedo)."
4,Great Fun,"This wildly funny movie barely gave me a chance to breathe during the time it was playing. Ben Stiller is a comical genius and Robert Deniro plays a great out-of-style role (normally acting in more serious movies), yet their chemistry was great.The movie has Ben Stiller, who would like to propose to his girlfriend, meeting her parents...and that's where the fun begins! I recommend this movie to everyone, it's one of the better comedies i've seen in awhile."
1,Meeting the Gentiles,"A better name for this movie is ""Meeting the Gentiles."" I am extremely tired of seeing Jewish men portrayed as insecure, ineffectual nervous people. I have never met a Jewish man like Woody Allen or this wannabe Woody in ""Meeting the Parents."" Cinema needs to retire this tiresome persona. It's never been more than barely tolerable. And in this movie, it is just plain creepy. This pathetic... guy is so condescending to his Gentile girlfriend that you pray throughout the movie that they won't stay together; that a light will finally go off in her head and she'll realize the guy is treating her like dirt because she was raised in a clean suburb and not in cesspool like New York or Detroit. It's an awful movie."
1,This was funny???,"I don't get it. Maybe I'm just a curmudgeon, but this was one of the most unfunny, contrived, STUPID movies I've seen in ages! The very few ""jokes"" that might have worked are nothing more than mean-spirited barbs. There's no sense of comedy, humour, or sympathy for the characters. It's just a loooong string of stupid people acting stupidly and suffering stupid consequences.I tried to give it two stars, but I came away from the theatre so angry that it doesn't get the second one. This is a movie that truly deserves one star."
1,Not even remotely plausable.,"I've given this movie one star for effort. But over all this is an uneven piece of .... It might have worked better if Ben Stiller had been a dumb teenager instead of a professional nurse. As it is, he is a professional nurse, and with all of that education, he can't explain his side of a string of horribly contrived disasters. It is one of those films where no one can explain the obvious because the script won't let them. It is a fine premise: boy meets girl's parents, it was just a rotten script. Jay Roach said this was the funniest of 50 scripts he had been reading... if this was the funniest, I would have hated to see the other 49. And by the way, is there anyone on the planet who's last name is actually spelled ""Focker?"""
3,Why DTS??,The movie was a 1 timer at best just ok with some parts being funny... However i cannot figure out why this movie was released in both 5.1dd and dts? one or the other would have sufficed.. in short this movie is just a rental..
3,Just ok.,"It had some funny parts. It had a couple of hilarious parts. But all in all, this movie was just average. I loved Ben Stiller in Something About Mary, and I'm sure everyone who saw this was looking at that movie also. But something was missing. Deniro trying to be funny was only funny in spots. Owen Wilson did a good job as usual, but the rest was just blah. So far, I have found only a handful of people who have enjoyed this movie thoroughly. It had the potential but just didn't click. Stiller spent most of his time in this movie either breaking something, catching it on fire, or just saying the wrong thing. Could anyone really blow it this bad?"
5,Hysterical,"For any couple who are scared to take that extra step into becoming a part of the family, this is a must see. Ben Stiller was hysterical as the outcast who yearns to win over his father-in-law. As the plot unfolds, many different mishaps occur. The family totem, Jinx the cat, is lost. Stiller's character goes to the local animal shelter, and spray paints the tail of a Himalayan so that it will appear that he has saved the day by finding this cat. This new cat wrecks the wedding preparations for Pam's younger sister; the altar that was varnished several times by Kevin bursts into flames. The septic tank needs to be drained because Stiller's character left the toilet running overnight. This is definately not his weekend. However, each faux pas left me howling. This is one of the better films I've seen."
3,Could have been better,"A DVD should present interesting detail of a scholarly kind. Otherwise, rent the video. This DVD had two voice-over comments; one by the cast and one by the director and I think producer. Why couldn't it have been just one with all of them on it. More than this, a director's cut would have been welcomed because they talk about the deleted scenes all the time. I would have liked to have seen them.The director was trying to establish a tension with the awkward, long silences and drawn out scenes. Unfortunately, this translates into boring when on the screen. I could have done with a lot less of the sappy love story and more or the humor of the Farelley brothers type.One of the very best parts rarely comented upon is the flight attendent scenes toward the end of the film. Guess I was expecting too much."
1,Meet the Parents,"There are many mistake on the Specifications about the movie. The Language is Only English , No Spanish and Neither French. The Caption is only English, No Spanish and Neither French like the seller describe. Personally I was looking for Spanish Caption. So I suggest at the seller fix the mistakes on the seller page."
4,Funniest movie of last year,I laughed and laughed at this movie! There had not been a just cute funny movie like this in quite a while. Too many movies are the 'Something About Mary' variety with potty humor. This movie was smart and had respected actors who really cracked me up. How Robert Dinero kept a straight face calling him Mr. Focker I don't know. Rent it it's funny!
3,Less Than Expected,I was expecting a movie that would keep me laughing throughout most of the movie. There were sporadic chuckles but overall I was disappointed. Some scenes seemed to drag on while others could have been milked for a few more yucks. The out takes and deleted scenes are a waste of time as most of them are not funny at all and others just boring. I gave the DVD 3 stars because of Robert De Niro's acting and his character.
2,Watch this for a couple of OK gags,"I have read most of the reviews here and most of some merit. I DID watch this with a group of people and most of us were not laughing. There were a giggle now and then. Most of the movie is so badly written and the people in the movie are acting really dumb for supposedly being so smart. If you like smart people acting really dumb and at times snobby and obnoxious then this might be for you. I almost turned it off in the middle because I couldn't take how just unbelievable it was. I know it is a comedy and it can take some artistic license, but this was way over the top at times. I love 2 of the 3 vacation movies and baseketball. So dumb comedys CAN be funny. You will get a few chuckles and maybe a ok laugh or two. The end the movie smartened up a bit but, that was so it could have a place to end. Overall I was disappointed. This is for the DVD which is why it gets the extra star for the extra features."
2,Meet the Predictables,What ELSE can go wrong to the character with a last name of Focker? Get it? Focker? This movie is way too predictable and silly. Just when you pray nothing else will go wrong...it does....you be the judge....boring.
4,What is wrong with you people????,"This is probably the best comedy of last year, There are more than enough laugh out loud moments to satisfy any normal person. The sequence with DeNiro's mothers ashes alone makes the film worth watching. The person who says DeNiro can't do comedy must be a comedian himself, his timing is spot on as always."
5,Mega Entertainer,"I feel confident enough to write this review because I have seen this movie easily over 50 times over the past four years. Everytime it comes on television or just pops in my computer I have to sit and watch it all the way through. Its just too darn funny! Everyone does an amazing job. Greg Foker (Ben Stiller) is invited to spend the weekend at his gorgeous girlfriend's house with her parents. Her sister was getting married and the situation is hectic to begin with. But when Greg meets Jack (Robert Deniro - the father), hell freezes over. It just keeps getting funnier from then on. Every scene is done at its best and there is nothing I would change from this one. Maybe make it a little longer? Enjoy. A true keeper."
3,So-So movie,"After all the hoopla over this movie, I bought it on DVD. I should have rented it instead. Sure, there are some chuckles but it certainly wasn't gut-busting funny. At points, I was bored with it. So if you haven't seen this movie, before you buy it, rent it."
3,Meet The Parents,"The movie is funny, but like other Stiller movies, it seems to go downhill. The scenes that were funny were pretty hilarious, but they were few and far between."
2,Too Predictable,"I had heard this was supposed to be really funny, and I must admit there were some humorous points. Overall, however, I thought the slapstick was really predicatable and went too far. Bad things happening over and over and over...it got old, fast. The ending was also very predictable.It's worth a rental, but I certainly wouldn't buy it."
2,Something About Mary 2000,You could call this a toned down version of Something About Mary and no one would notice. Another messed up love story with Ben Stiller. Ninety percent of the crazy events that happen are ruined in the previews. It really isn't worth even a rental.
2,another disappointing comedy,"I had heard and read about how funny this movie was - I know many who saw it more than once. I found it contrived - lacking cleverness, wit or subtlety. I found myself getting more and more annoyed and frustrated as the story unfolded. There were a few humorous scenes, but not enough to save it for me. The last scene was a culmination of the tacky and awkward humor throughout the film, as he was letting out his frustrations into the hidden camera. I love physical or silly comedy, as long as somehow we are given the idea that there is intelligence behind it. I was relieved to read the other less than positive reviews, because I felt alone in not being impressed by this film."
2,This Film is NOT VERY FUNNY. Another Disappointing Comedy.,"I really wanted to laugh, but found myself with a grimmace for most of the movie. The characters were way to contrived and the jokes and humor were forced. I actually found myself annoyed most of the time by the characters. Ecept for just a rare 2 or 3 funny clips, this film was actually annoying."
2,eh..,"This one just doesn't come out right... you'd expect Ben Stiller and Robert Deniro to work well together, and this movie bombs by no fault of the cast, who perform admirably. Its just that, we've seen all these sight gags before, and anything original here just doesn't hit the mark enough to be really funny. Stiller's would-be family are such snooty, annoying people that frankly, you'd rather see him just drop everything and forget about marrying this girl."
2,Funny for the easily amused,"Meet the Parents is about a male nurse (Ben Stiller) who spends a weekend with his girlfriend at her parent's house. Stiller finds out immediately that his girlfriend's father (DeNiro) is quite the character. Stiller's character tries his best to impress his potential father in law but of course the harder he tries the worse things become. The film does have some funny moments especially the subtle jokes but the more obvious jokes are not so funny, just dumb and predictable. Meet the Parents is just another movie in the continuing downward spiral of DeNiro's career. When did Robert DeNiro become so lame?? If you are easily amused you will love Meet the Parents if you are not it would just remind you of old Three's Company re-runs. If you are a fan of Robert DeNiro and you want to see a comedy rent Midnight Run....that was made when DeNiro was cool."
2,Something *NOT* about the Parents,"I saw this one and figured ""Hey, Ben Stiller is funny, and it has De Niro in it, so how bad could it be?""The answer: Pretty bad. My wife and I both felt like this movie was a waste of the time we took to watch it.This movie tried to hit the same vein of humor as Something About Mary, but missed at almost every occasion. Nothing in this movie seemed to click. De Niro's character came across as both poorly written and poorly acted.We almost turned this movie off 5 or 6 different times, but finally ended up watching the whole thing just to see how it ended. So I guess I can say that it does it least have that going for it."
3,Mediocre Meeting,"Meet The Parents - One of the blockbusters of 2000. This movie stars Ben Stiller as the main character who falls in love with a woman and then they will get married, but FIRST he needs to meet the womans parents. So many things happen there, and all of them really start to dislike each other. There are tons of Cliches, which can get annoying, but there are some funny parts, like when Ben Stiller is getting on the plane and he needs to be removed ( that's all I'll say.) The ending is pretty good, so overall, it can get stupid and boring, but it's worth a rent at your local movie store.Alex S."
2,HMMM...DID WE ALL WATCH THE SAME MOVIE?,"I'll be blunt: this movie is definitely NOT as funny as many people would like you to think it is. Oh, it has its moments here and there during which you'll chuckle and giggle. A couple of lines will even have you laugh out loud. Just don't expect the riotous laughfest that's been promised by reviews on this site or by the television commercials themselves.The DVD includes a couple of deleted scenes, one of which (""Surf & Tur*"") should definitely have been left in the film because it's actually funny. The outtakes should have been omitted altogether because, frankly, they're boring.This is not the worst film you could ever watch, but it certainly doesn't live up to the hype. This is a definitely NOT a purchase. Maybe worth a rental if there's nothing else available, otherwise skip it."
3,Not That Funny,"This movie should have been better than it was. The ""big"" scenes could have been alot better."
2,Disappointing at best,"After so much hype, and the movie teasers, I was expecting this to be a pretty funny movie.Unfortunately, after nearly 30 minutes into the movie, I had uttered scarcely a chuckle. De Niro, of course, does his usual good job. Ben Stiller adequately plays pretty much the same ""Something About Mary"" character.I thought there were less laughs than ""About Mary"", with the two major comedic scences space apart by agonizingly long periods of irritating nervousness between Ben Stiller's character and ""the dad"".At least ""About Mary"" had the funniest part up front. ""Meet the Parents"" makes you wait nearly 30 minutes before the first good one.In fact, if you've seen the full trailer, you've seen all the funny parts. If you are a fan, its worth the rent, but not the buy. My copy is up for sale."
2,Humor lessened by innuendo,"This movie was hilarious during many parts. Poor Mr. Focker's constant streak of problems really had me rolling on the floor. I loved this screwball element, the neverending onslaught of difficulty and misunderstanding. But all of the sexual and homosexual double entendres really distracted me from the humor, because I don't find such shallow jokes and things funny at all.I would like to watch Meet the Parents again for the intriguing plot, but I would find it difficult because all of the less than funny things really take away from the experience."
2,Is supidity funny?,"I know the majority of the people found this movie funny, but I found it very stupid. And I really like good comedies, but this one is not. It is just a sum of stupid gags. To enjoy this you really need to leave your brain at the entrance of the theatre. The only good thing about the movie were one or two gags, and the always funny Ben stiller, whose talent for comedy is unquestionable. De Niro has the same stupid mafia face throughout the movie, I think he should return to serious movies -he was funny in ""Analize This"" though. If you want to see good movies with Ben Stiller I would recommend the very different ""Something About Mary"", where he really gets to display his squills, or the romantic comedy Keeping The Faith, seen by not too many people but a nice, warm-hearted comedy directed by first-timer Eduard Norton, who is also a lead character in the film."
4,Hilarious!,"I believe the term 'snowball effect' would be apt in describing the overall plot of Meet the Parents. Good-hearted Gaylord 'Greg' Focker has the biggest cloud of doom hanging over him on the weekend that he visits his girlfriend, Pam's, family--especially in the eyes of her hard-as-nails judgmental father. Greg wants to make the best impression possible, as he desperately wants to marry Pam. Time after time, Greg tries to get on Pam's father's good side, only to have each scheme blow up in his face--not to mention almost ruining a family wedding and destroying the house!Ben Stiller again plays a loveable guy next door. He and Robert DeNiro (Pam's father) have terrific chemistry as old buck and young buck trying to keep Pam's affections. The DVD also has some great outtakes and deleted scenes. Great for a night when you want to do nothing but laugh."
5,Comedy at its best,"If you are a picky hard to please type of person (when it comes to comedy), then watch this movie and I guarantee that you will be recommending it to everyone to watch afterwards.This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. An excellent work by Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro."
4,Original and refreshing,"Meet the Parents is a breath of fresh air- it's hilarious without straining to be, with an entertaining plot and terrific cast. Ben Stiller is hilarious as Greg, a male nurse who wants to get permission from his girlfriend's father before asking her(Pam)to marry him. Greg immediatley gets nervous around Pam'sfather Jack(Robert De Niro) and lies to sound good. This leads to different hilarious scenes that lead to an even more hilarious and perfect ending. Meet the Parents is undoubtedly one of, if not the, best comedies of 2000."
4,There's something about Robert DeNiro......,"After meeting the parents of his girlfriend, one thing after another goes wrong for Greg Focker. Imagine meeting the parents of your spouse-to-be for the first time. Imagine everything that can go wrong. That sums up this movie. I thought Robert DeNiro did a great job in this movie. Ben Stiller just seems to be playing the same character jumping from movie to movie.I don't watch a lot of comedies, but this movie had me laughing from beginning to end. My husband, on the other hand, thought it was horrible. Maybe it's just the perspective from which you watch it. Overall, it's not a bad rental."
4,Funny and goodhearted at the same time,"Meet the parents was one of the best comedies of 2000. Though many people think there aren't enought jokes to satisfy, it's evened out by believable characters and cheerfulness. I recommend this movie for anyone who needs a good movie to watch."
4,Surreally Funny First Impressions,"Gaylord 'Greg' Focker, male nurse, just wanted to make a good impression on his future in-laws. Ben Stiller brought his unique brand of comic timing to bear against his suitably dour, unimpressed, ex-CIA dad-to-be, Robert DeNiro. Frequently bitingly humourous, there are some good belly laughs to be had as well. DeNiro's under the breath condemnation of Greg's purported drug problems are great. The master-of everything ex-beau, the volleyball match, the septic tank, the race home, the cat incident all combine for a high-brow/low-brow joke coupling that works. Recommended."
5,One of the best,"I think you people who rate this movie lowly are missing the point & the true nature of its humor. You're right when you say that it lacks typical comedy of the falling down the stairs, oh-my-God he hurt his head sort. In Meet the Parents, the humor is a bit different. It's in the way Greg Fokker holds his hands up, clasped in prayer, just a bit too high. It's in the way he manages to commit every possible faux pas, and then some. It's how when they're playing volleyball, the moment he starts to try hard, he breaks the girl's nose. It is about how this poor guy is totally unable to understand the customs of the girl's parents. That is Meet the Parents humor."
2,Good Plot Badly Done,"""Meet The Parents"" is about a male nurse who wants to marry his girlfriend but has to spend a weekend at her parents house.Ben Stiller plays the male nurse and does a funny job. Robert DeNiro plays the father but he acts great too. But there's something missing from the from the plot.There are a few jokes like the one about milking cats and the one about marijuana but there aren't many good jokes. I found this movie fairly boring but my friends liked it so you might to."
1,Parental Dissent,"What a waste of time and money. ""Meet the Parents"" is a painfully UNfunny film only slightly redeemed by Robert DeNiro parodying his traditional ""tough guy"" role--who wouldn't be intimidated to have him as a father-in-law? Ben Stiller proves again, however, that he A) can't select good material to star in or B) is a terribly overrated talent. Pass."
1,MEET THE PARENTS,THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A SLAP-STICK COMEDY THAT JUST DOESN'T MAKE IT. THE TIMING IS POOR AND TIMING IS WHAT COMEDY IS ALL ABOUT. I WONDER WHAT THE DIRECTOR WAS THINKING ABOUT AND THE CAST DIRECTOR WHEN THEY TRIED TO TURN ROBERT DE NIRO INTO A COMEDIAN. HE JUST DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO CREATE COMEDY IN HIS FACE. THE LOOK COMES OFF PHONEY.
2,Had Potential,"Meet The Parents really had potential, but, it fell flat. De Niro's and Stiller's talents were wasted. The story had good ideas, but, timing and direction killed them. There was too much time watching and waiting for things to happen. Apparently, the director was assuming that the audience had little or no imagination. I laughed at a few things, but, I felt this movie was a waste of my time, money, and gas to pick it up at the video store. I was constantly feeling uncomfortable for Ben Stiller, yet, thinking how stupid he was for his lies. I did like how he ruined the wedding plans for De Niro's other daughter, but, that was a long drawn out breath. If the young people today consider this funny, they need to gain a little more depth to them. This movie appears to be a rough draft instead of a finished product. I didn't like it."
2,First half of the movie was good.....,"This movie started out pretty funny, but just ran out of jokes. Most of the jokes used were not very original anyway, and were stolen from There's Something About Mary. It seems the minute Ben Stiler started smoking on the roof of the house, the movie went really downhill, everything that happened from then was not very funny and just got very stupid. A big problem too was that the trailers to this movie gave away some of the best jokes. Don't rent or buy this movie, wait until it gets on HBO/Showtime then watch it."
3,"If you've seen a Stiller movie, well, here it is again.","Unfortunately this movie is like most every other Ben Stiller comedies. A slight plot, goofy characters, and a string of sight gags and impossible situations.I expected more out of this movie, but I guess I shouldn't have. Robert DeNiro plays a good jerk, but that's the only highlight of the movie.It's not the funniest movie ever, the funniest movie of the year, or even a very funny movie. Watch it for a handful of good gags, and that's about it."
1,108 Minutes of Boredom,This movie was a total flop. For the first 70 minutes or so I felt like I was in a coma. This movie should be recommended as a cure for those with insomnia. A total bore. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
4,A Funny and Harious Movie!,"Meet The Parents is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen! I got it on DVD the day it came out, and just love it! It has cool behind the seens stuff! Get you copy today!"
5,Ben Stiller: on top of the Comedy World,"In my mind the two funniest comedians in the world right now are Jim Carrey and Ben Stiller. Meet the Parents is one the funniest movies that I have ever I seen. Next to movies like Planes, Trains and Automobiles and The Full Monty this is right up there as a comedy classic. BUt the great part about Meet the parents is that it's easy to watch this movie over and over again because the comedy is fast paced and full of great energy."
2,"Nice Mix, but (Disappointingly) Little Score","This is a nice compilation or ""mix"" album, and evokes a nice feel and flavor of the world of the film. However, Christopher Young's music for the movie was gorgeous and barely appears here. Even the tracks notated as ""score"" are misrepresented, as they are odd little snippets that don't even include the film's truly haunting and beautiful main theme. I was so disappointed to realize the CD did not include any of the real score at all. Still, a worthy purchase for some gorgeous and evocative classic songs."
2,New Steps in Latin-Teacher's Manual,"This is a booklet based on a view of the Text; New First Steps in Latin that I did not find at all helpful, and I have consequently returned the booklet today to an address in Fulham, London.8th April 2010"
4,No bumps? No way!,"Bikini Zone has long been recommended as a product to treat razor bumps and irritation - after the shave - and although I hadn't tried Bikini Zone, I knew I had to try the shave gel. It had to work well after the original product received such rave reviews. And it does.Thought this formula may be a bit slippery for some, you don't have to use much and, unlike other leading women's shave gels, you can see right through it so you know what and where you are shaving.Bikini Zone shave gel has a pleasant smell and even has moisture beads to help your skin stay in its top condition. While it doesn't eliminate all bumps and irritation, I get a close shave and the condition of my skin post-shave is quite improved.Bikini Zone works well for the intended area!"
1,Still got bumps!,This did absolutely nothing for me. I still got razor bumps. It doesn't work as well as a regular foaming shave gel. I feel like I just used soap and water. Never use it again.
1,Irritating!,"I have always used the regular formula Bikini Zone bikini area shave gel along with the Bikini Zone after-shave anti-bump gel. I got a great deal on this ""extra gentle"" formula and it was a bonus size with 25% more free. Since I have sensitive skin, I was thinking that this extra gentle formula would even be better for me. I was wrong! This formula actually ""suds-up""- which is not like the regular formula, and made me very itchy in uncomfortable places! Also, all of the printing on the container had washed off all over the shower and made quite a mess."
2,Joe sounds better elswhere!,"I would be willing to bet Joe Cocker had no say in the release of ""Standing Here"", a live 2 cd set recorded in May of 1981. The recording finds Joe Cocker at a stage in his career when he was still getting back on his feet from years of abuse. His voice is weak and the band is surely not as good as his late 80's and 90's Chris Stainton bands. The cd has most of his classics and some nice mid-seventies album tracks but they lack the power of his best live offerings. Listen to his ""Maddogs and Englishmen"" or his ""Joe Cocker Live"" cd's and compare it to this release and you will see what I mean. I am sure some fan is going to be upset with this review but if you are truly a big Joe Cocker fan like myself, you know this does not come close to his best live recordings. I would not be shocked if this cd went out of print fairly quickly. Thank goodness Joe is healthy again and singing better than ever, but this release should be avoided."
3,This was a soso model,"First off, I am a AFOL (Adult Fan Of Lego), and I only bought this because it was on sale, and I was looking to add more Lego parts to my collection. All-in-all, there wasn't as many parts as I was expecting. I did assemble the primary model, and was also disappointed with it's functionality."
3,can't really tell,"Replacing the battery made no difference, probably the garage door opener remote is broken.The product was shipped and arrived on time."
5,Nothing to say,"It's a battery......what can you say about a battery? Product came in good condition and on time, as promised . Works just fine."
4,"Good Quality, Fast Service","Cheap. Good Quality, Fast Service. It's fit perfectly with my 2 car's remote. Last time I bought, it cost double for the price."
2,Only game in town for replacing garage door remote batteries,These batteries art too pricey - where are other generic alkaline competitors? They tend to get depleted fairly often. I keep waiting for a lithium variant - at least then you wouldn't have to change the batteries so often.
2,Won't help with a menu.,"We got this for a trip to Tuscany in Italy and were hoping it would be helpful in restaurants when they don't have english menus. Almost none of the words in any menu were in the guide, including ones for beef, chicken, pork etc. It is not a very good dictionary."
3,language chip,It is good but not as convenient as I thought it would be. It takes a bit long to look up and use the language translator. The preset phrases are a lame.
1,Not a helpful tool,"This product takes more time to figure out then it is worth. It was useless with basic road signs in French or French menus. One really bad example is that you can find a useful phrase and ask ""Where can I go handgliding""? Wow, that will come in handy over and over. It is so bad as a translator that I would never recommend anyone to buy this product, you would truly be wasting your money."
1,"Returned Item, would not work with GPS","I had to return item because it did not have the chip with in a chip that would fit my GPS. I had brought a language guide about a year ago for my other and same type of GPS which came with the dual chip. I was disappointed and returned item, but have not seen a credit to my account. I would still like to get this Language Guide, but am not sure before purchasing that it has the dual chip. Do you have any idea's??"
4,"Good product, promtly was ship. Can trust the seller.",Product is good in many different languages. For travel is great to get to know some phrase.
4,Somewhat a Good Book,"The book is good, an interesting read but it lacks qualities I like in other books such as Fearless and Harry Potter. It interested me when I saw it in the school library and it had a lot of Accelerated Reader points so I picked it up. Quite good and I reccomend you read it."
3,Great shade,"It fit pretty good, comfortable. I think it can last few summer. It come with a case. For the price, I think it's pretty good quilty."
5,An Encouraging Success Story for Those on the Vajrayana Path,"This book is about the tale of Tibet's most beloved saint, Milarepa translated from a Tibetan source. It tells of how he embarked on the journey of revenge, and then realizing the grave mistake of taking many lives, seek the Vajrayana path through his guru, Marpa, to attain enlightenment in a single lifetime. Milarepa encountered many hardships but finally achieved his goal.Anybody who has not heard or read about the life of Milarepa but on the Vajrayana path should read this book as Milarepa is an excellent role model."
5,If you haven't read the story of Milarepa this is a good one,"The story of Milarepa is a classic in Tibet. He is their Robin Hood and their Shakespere, and universally loved. This is the most well known of the recent translations and provides a readable and fun story, if not something that is somehow going to provide enlightment.Milarepa starts out as an orphaned child who learns magic to defeat an uncle who slaughtered his family. Later in life, he renounces those powers and becomes a monk.I highly recommend this book!"
4,"Buy It For Bright Eyes, Love It For Son, Ambulance","This is one of the best split records I've ever listened to. The Bright Eyes melodies sound like they're directly from the Lifted sessions, meaning they're quite raw and moving. The real gems here are the Son, Ambulance tracks. Brown Park is one of the best songs I've heard in a while. The Invention of Beauty proves that their soft tunes rival even Mr. ""Bright Eyes"" Oberst. I'm still quite amazed that Saddle Creek still is under most people's radar, but with amazing artists like Bright Eyes, Son, Ambulance, Rilo Kiley, Cursive, an Azure Ray, it's almost certain they won't be for long."
4,conor oh conor,"what an excellent split!if you have a special place in your heart for conor oberst, as i do, this is a sure thing. i wouldn't recommend this for someone who isn't previously aquainted with saddle creek and the kind of stuff they put out, but for a fan of bright eyes, this is a great addition to your collection. before i bought this cd i hadn't heard ""son, ambulance"" and was pleasantly suprised. their songs are a good balance to the sometimes gratuitous despair and helplessness exhibited in the bright eyes even tracks. track 4 is quickly becoming one of my favorites for bright eyes and ""no lies, just love"" is just incredible song writing.this is a great buy. you won't be disappointed!my hat's off to you saddle creek! rock on"
4,It's a Wonder This Got Off The Ground,Before you mark this as an unhelpful review please read it. I'm a fan of both of these bands. Hell I'm from Omaha it's almost required. But originally I didnt expect much out of this joining of self obsessed frontmen. It's honestly a wonder that it got off the ground. Props go to Presto studios in Lincoln Nebraska and more specifically Mogis for keeping these two egos in check.
5,It's a battery,"It's a battery and it works, what more is there to say?! I needed this for an electronic band saw. It arrived on time with Amazon Prime."
3,Type J battery,"Came to me in slightly discharged state. Did not power up display on my radial arm saw. However, this battery was apparently not the problem. I managed to get a fully charged battery locally and it still did not fix my problem."
1,Andreas Raufeisen- ART,"I THINK --- Big art, nice womans, but...- where is my stuff ? Where is this my book?Many Greetings,Stepan Mares, Prague, Czech republik, Europe."
3,"Good book, bad support","The book gives very practical tips for looking slimmer. There's supposedly a website where you can post questions. However, after 5 months, they still haven't responded to the question."
4,"Excellent advice, but title is off putting","Leah Feldon's latest book offers excellent advice on dressing slim, including colors & silhouettes. I hate the title, however, as it focuses on women's angst about their body image. A better title might simply be ""Dressing Slim."""
3,"MEN, look elsewhere","This book is OK, but despite the title, it's only for women. The token chapter for men is a joke."
2,The unbroken line of black,"This book does succeed in telling women how to create an unbroken line of monochromatics, which creates the illusion of a longer, leaner body. However, it is not in the books's scope to tell you how to flatter your unique shape. If you are a woman who is round all around, or thick top and down without much waist definition, these tips will work great. However, any curvaceous woman, like a pear or an hourglass, might wish to purchase ""The Pocket Stylist"" instead, as the advice there is not to make you look leaner as much as flatter your existing body type. As an hour glass, these tips made me look boxy, much leaner, but boxy as though I were shaped like a ruler."
3,Maybe I've just read too many style books...,"I've read quite a few style books myself and I was a little disappointed in this one. All the usual dress thin techniques are in here (black, vertical lines, etc...) and I really didn't learn anything new. But as a general guideline for dressing to appear slimmer and stylish, you could do much worse. It's well written and if you're new to style books, this is a good one to start with."
5,not only for soft shaped ladies! basic rules of harmonious figure,"I am Italian and I sew. this means that clothing is a basic necessity for me. I am blessed with a good figure but everytime I help a friend in looking at her best, I have not been able to tell her why I insist for a certain lenght or a neckline. in this book there are the reasons why certain harmonies are so perfect and why other choices are wrong on two ladies apparently similar. It is the basic book to reinvent the proportions of the body you don't know how to look at- yours -and to look just beautiful. it is the written version of what enhainces without all the mistery aura of the ""good tasted gurus"". to be read and to be offered as a gift."
3,Maybe just not for me,"I thought the advice was ok, but I dunno...The problem with these sorts of books is that they fixate on everyone trying to be the same way (even if they claim otherwise!). I'm a short woman, curvy, with a big chest, and I always thought that was well, sexy. Really, I did. Leah Feldon however, felt that a shape like mine was ""matronly"" or magnified every single extra pound. Which is fine, it goes to the theme of her book--making everyone look thinner--but I guess I would have liked some simple dressing tips without so much negative judgement attached to my body as a whole. Keep it in mind that if you're not perfect, this book will have the tendency to make you feel worse about the fact that you're not perfect."
3,Entertaining and engaging reading,"This is a very readable book, liberally sprinkled with interesting quotes from celebrities (large and small, young and old, literally). The basic advice, however, is plain, plainer and plainest. Which makes you look thinner, I would have to agree- and much less colorful than many of us want to be. There are some excellent points about lines and details that might not otherwise cross your mind, and the overall effect of things that made me want to throw everything out and make a new wardrobe at once, but I'm feeling better now. Maybe I don't ALWAYS have to look thinner, you know?"
1,Falls apart in the rain,Don't let this wreath get wet. I got one as a gift and left it out on a rainy day it fell apart in a soggy mess.
4,Great for the first time traveller to Italy,"I am finding this book extremely helpful in my ""discovery"" of Venice and the surrounding area. This is not a guide book, but does offer many basic things to know with good explanation. The resource text is small so be aware of this. I photocopied the sections I needed and made my own notes in planning my trip. Not for the quick fix obvious guide book info, but for people who want to know more dialogue about their upcoming adventure."
5,Hooray for Dame Cleo,"I have always loved Cleo Laine, and finally having access to her work in the earlier stages of her brings a smile to my face."
2,Make that three...,"It's not quite abysmal, but it's close. The explanations are unclear; the examples, as noted, are horribly simple; and when you need to refer back to something earlier, it's hard to find. Thankfully I have a copy of Calculus: Early Transcendentals Single and Multivariable by Anton, Bivens, & Davis that I can use to figure out what's going on. If you're stuck with this book, I suggest you find a better textbook to use as a reference and just get your homework problems out of this one."
5,Excelente producto,"Producto original, buena calidad, llegó en el tiempo pautado, no tuve ningun problema para realizar el proceso de compra. Recomiendo el producto y al vendedor."
5,Bass liines kickin,"I heard this song played at God's Kitchen@code by Paul oakenfold, as you might of guessed this is an Oakie-anthem because he's been playin this track for the past 12 months I think at the other club/rave scenes. I fell in love with this song cause tt has deep bass lines that will keep you hypnotized and will also make you keep on dancin!!! BUY IT."
4,Good beginner's guide,"We're planning a trip for next fall, and this has been a great beginner's guide for us. I like how the segments are broken down by area of Scotland and type of activity you're looking for. It also has a section on the best time to travel and other helpful hints. Another favorite part is the recommended trips and itineraries if you have 1 week, 2 weeks or longer. I do wish there were more pictures. Apart from that, it looks like a great deal of time has gone into cataloguing favorite sites and suggesting restaurants, shopping areas and museums."
4,pretty good,"This book is helpful. It gives you a feel for the neighborhoods of Edinburgh. Restaurant recommendations were very helpful. Maps helped. And it helped us get to where we had to goin Scotland. No photos, though."
4,classic rock and soul hits,I loved disc one and only liked disc two. Loved the compilation of classic rock and soul hits. Inclusion of Sam Cooke's civil rights song Change is Gonna Come and James Brown's classic It's a Man's World are the icing on the cake. You get the concert feel with crowd noise and high energy version of rock classics. Wasn't as nuts about the second disc mostly because there's only so much you can do with songs you've heard a thousand times over on the radio--golden oldies that are growing moldy. But even disc two had a few songs that were definitely worth listening to.

4,Sandisk SD HD Memory Card,The memory card is the best price for a 4GB I had bought to date. I now have plenty of memory to take hundreds of pictures on my digital camera. I will buy this card again from the same source.
5,4.0GB SD HC Memory Card,"Fits, works great, and is everything you expect from a memory card! Fits my camera and has not given me any problems at all. I'm very happy with San Disk SD card."
4,Great Value,Good price on this product. Use this SD card in my point and shoot camera as well as game cameras. Much less expensive than other stores and you get the same result.
5,sandisk 4 GB card,"excellent product, fast shipping, reasonable price, excellent seller the disk is primarily used in my bushnell trail cameras, and i switch them from camera to camera, i have 4 cameras, the card seem to hold up in all kinds of weather extremes here in Wi."
1,Never Received it,"I can't review this product because I never received it. The company that was supposed to send it to me emailed that it got returned to them by the post office ""for some unknown reason"", so my grand daughter didn't get this part of her Christmas gift."
5,twice is not enough,"We bought our first card for my wifes Nikon D80.The owners manual specified this size and brand so we felt confident.It performed so well I wanted one for my older Cannon Powershot S31S,but I wondered. The camera was from the era when a 250 meg card was considered big.A call to Cannon Tech support confirmed it was indeed compatible,and it has performed flawlessly.Check first with the people who make your particular device before ordering, you will be glad you did."
2,i dont know,well i dont know if its me but isn't this suppose to be able to go in your computer so i can get the memory transferred? it doesnt work like that I am pretty upset I went of vacation took photos and its not reading and I have 3 computers in my house and none is a no go.. I got to figure out another way time to dig up my usb cord..
4,CHEAAAAAAAAAAAP!,"Card was cheaaaaaaap, altho did not come in any packaging tho seller stated ""new"", there werent any files on it when recieved so if it was used atleast they cleaned it up! Either was it was like[...] or something for 4GB so i'm not complaining!Thanks for a quick delivery as well!"
5,Its A Memory Card,"Its A Memory Card. That sums it all up. It works fine with my camera, and it holds many pictures. If you need a memory card, this is a good one to get. It is cheap and can hold many pictures.Five Stars"
1,Poor excuse for not shipping items,"I ordered a 4 GB memory card from Digital Media Source through Amazon, along with a digital camera and picture frame. Because of the order total ($300), I qualified for free shipping, but Digital Media cancelled the shipment because they said my address was invalid. The address is fine - I've been here for 20 years - and the other items arrived in 2 days. After reading the other reviews of how they slam people with high shipping charges, it appears that they won't ship it under the free shipping condition - they don't make enough money. The invalid address excuse is a sneaky trick. I'm going to Walmart to pick one up for $4 more, but no $12 shipping charge."
4,Never been disappointed,"I've bought a bunch of these. Always worked well. Don't know about the 8mb cards, but the 4mb cards are a dream."
1,"Cheap, breaks VERY easily.","I JUST BOUGHT one of these cards two days ago, brand new, for 15 dollars.Unfortunately, I cannot actually review this product because the card actually broke inside the camera I was using. Thats correct, after ONE USE the card BROKE! One moment I was taking pictures, the very next moment my camera couldn't read the card!The 4gb SD Card cannot be read in my computer, the locking mechanism is stuck in LOCKED mode, and its ultimately useless.I won't reccommend this product to anybody, and would advice any potential buyers to seek another brand because clearly SanDisk has dropped the ball."
1,Item Was Never Received and Interacting With This Merchant Has Been Appalling!,"I never received the item that I paid for from this merchant(Digital Media Source)! I raised the matter with them on several occasions, over many months, but their feedback has either been non-existent or useless! The reply from them would be something like ""Please confirm your address and we will submit a claim for investigation."" Nothing positive ever came out of these ""investigations"" and, after almost a year, I haven't received the item and I haven't been refunded.This is easily the worst online shopping experience I've ever had and I'd hate to believe that this is how they usually (mis)treat their customers. I'm quite certain that I will not be buying anything from them again!"
2,"Product fine, vendor misleading practices","I have no complaints about this product, but I refuse to buy it from any vendor (in this case ChiTek, but apparently there are others) who advertise a low price but then charge your 3X what they should for shipping. I tried to order $10 worth of memory cards, and after filling out all the necessary ordering information, I'm informed on the last page that they were charging $19.95 shipping for about 3 ounces of product. The final price was typical, but I'd much rather buy it direct from Amazon or another vendor that does not follow these arguably sleazy practices. I hope you do to. Be aware."
3,Shipping Price is out of Line,Beware. They charge you about three times their shipping cost. They shipped me one of these cards via US Mail and their cost was $0.44 (44 cents) yet they charged me $1.49. They just stuck it in an envelope with no packing. Seems like they could have wrapped it in tissue paper. They didn't even stamp the envelop to hand process the envelop. Luckily the card seems to work okay. Next time I will look for a different supplier. NOT RECOMMENDED.
1,You get what you pay for...,"I guess I should have known better, you can't get something for cheap and expect it to perform properly. This card corrupted my photos while it was in my camera! I have never had problems with other SanDisk products but this one is junk..."
3,The title BULK & picture of 2 SD cards is misleading,The title BULK and the picture with 2 SD cards together is quite misleading. I also did not get the exact item pictured. I guess we have yet to see how well they do work.
4,Pleased wtih the SoundFly,"When i first plugged the Soundfly Mp3 transmitter in, I was a bit concerned about the sound quality. Read the directions, turned on the Audio Boost, adjusted the Frequency and the sound quality is as good a the CD's I play. The quality of the Mp3 is important, if the Mp3 quality is bad this unit will pick it up, and if the quality of your Mp3 is good. You will have good music quality. I only give it a 4 star, cause that is reserved for High dollar, High end sound."
1,Did not work on my picture frame,"I purchased this memory card specifically to use in my Kodak Picture Frame but apparently the picture frame does not recognize this memory card. When I first did my search to purchase this card with Amazon, I entered the make and model of my picture frame. Prior to all this I purchased a memory card from my local computer accessories store and that card did not work in my picture frame either. So that is the reason why I decided to purchase it from Amazon - I thought I could identify my product so I would get the exact item that I need. But that did not work either. The card works in my Nikon D90 camera though, so I have an extra memory card for my camera - maybe I can sell it."
1,didnt work,"I put this in my camera and it wouldnt work at all, it just kept saying cant read card. not sure why, it does work for my sons ds i but not in a camera."
5,HELD MEMORY LIKE A CHAMP,"EVEN THOUGH THESE DAYS ITS CONSIDERED SMALL, THIS MEMORY CARD WAS GREAT TO HAVE AND EASY TO USE, THATS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME..."
5,Awesome!!,Fast and it works great! I have several of these already and no complaints at all so far! Love it love it love it!! Thank you!
3,Works,"It works, it was cheaper than going to walmart or the PX. If you can wait a little while for it to be shipped to you then you can't go wrong..."
4,Nice,No issues with the card. Work perfectly and didnt have any trouble is copying photos. I would recommend this product.
5,Memory for camera,Bought this Scandisk to be able to get more pictures than my 2GB disk. It is a great price and works as expected.
5,Great accessory,My mother will be able to store many pictures on this memory card as it is her first digital camera. Great accessory.
3,Kodak film,I never did receive the product I ordered and was charged for. I have contacted Amazon and the carrier about this but I have yet to receive the item.
4,"Nice but received with out any packeg, should be cheaper.",its ok but u should buy more then 4gb card to get the full experience.
5,Very good product,"This memory disc is versatile - it fits in my Canon SD camera, fits on all our laptops, and fits in the digital frame we got. It stored tones of pictures and music. Works well. In terms of speed, I don't have what to compare it to. Good value for price."
1,the item is not the same in the picture!,"the item is not the same in the picture!WHY?now i need to prove is this is goog or not!that is not fair!but if the produt no working good i am returned, tk-u"
2,Get what you pay for,I thought I was getting a great deal with 4 GB and the price under $10It worked great in my Nikon digital camera...then suddenly it broke (the gold metal on the back came lose) and I no access to the pictures on the disc.You get what you pay for!!
1,Still have not got this in the mail,I think you need this in your hand before reviewing it. Ordered early December. It is now Jan 9th. I heard it is on the way....
5,Nice,Has lots of space and works great! I use it in my camera because it came with a card that had very little space. Great quality too!
5,4GB SDHC,This is a great buy and the Sandisk is a great product. I would buy it again and recommend it for all thos e that need this size a disk.
2,Stop playing,"This product is not working for me, could be my Devices, but i have an SD by Kodak and Polaroid and they work fine. You decide.4GB SDHC (Secure Digital HC) Card Sandisk SDSDB-4096 (BUB-S)"
3,Good One,There is nothing more in this product to like or dislike... the package arrived on time and it was go
1,4 gb card,"Not happy. Saves information well, but computer cannot recognize it like it does with my other chips. I have to leave the chip in my camera. The card readers don't recognize the chip."
1,very disappointed:(do not order!,"i was really disappointed..I placed my order on 6th September, and I have been waiting to be delivered between 10-15 September.I could't track it , because as the seller explained to me, under 30$ purchase you can't track your orders..I have been waiting till 21st September and when I wrote them to ask again , when I am going to receive the order placed more than two weeks ago,they could not give me any information, what is going on. When I asked for a refund , they said I have to wait one month more...That is really ridiculous:)))So , it appears that I should wait about two months,counting from the day when the order was placed...I would never order something from this seller again..."
5,Good SD Card,"card works great, i bought it for my Nintendo Wii to put all my old original nintendo games on, 4 gig will be more than enough. 2 gb would of prob been enough truthfully for anyone looking to buy an SD card for ur Wii, Just make sure it is an SD HC for the Wii, has to be an HC. atleast that is what i read online. but anyway working great so far. thanks"
1,No read memory card,"I bought this SD card in preparation for a new digital camera and thought it was a great deal (only about $7). After purchasing the camera I installed this new memory card and it seemed to be capturing the images just fine. However, when trying to transfer the images to my PC or through a Photosmart printer an error displayed that it could not read the card. I was disappointed since all of our holiday pictures were taken with the camera and captured on this card. Maybe a bad batch of Sandisk cards were produced around that time. Has anyone else had this experience before?"
4,Good Size Storage - Inexpensive,"I bought four of these SD cards for about $20.00. The same items at Best Buy would have cost $68.00 They also came with a plastic case which I wasn't expecting. I have to use a screwdriver to open the case, that's why the four stars instead of five. Make sure you spend an extra $5 on something to get the Free Shipping. It's nice to have extra cards around for pictures and video on my camera."
5,It's a memory card!,"Does what it says...stores photos and videos. Nice! As long as it retains the photos and videos as long as I want them to remain on the card, then the card would be a worthwhile purchase."
4,Somehow ahead of its time,"The product works fine in my camera. But apparently the rest of the World (my PC, my old camera) is not prepared to its beauty. Furthermore, the price is right if you're using free shipping."
1,SanDisk 4 GB SDHC card,"I ordered the 4 GB SanDisk card as recommended by Amazon via an outside seller, Digital Media Outlet in New York. The card appears to be a genuine SanDisk product and was received in a sealed package. But it doesn't work -- the computer can't open the card advising it is defective. I have other SanDisk SCHC cards which work fine. I would not purchase from this source."
2,sandisk sdhc card 4 gb,"I has to complain fo this people ,because they send my card and i never go it, i has not idea what company carry this item ,but they said was undeliverable,and is not tru because i received anothers item from amaon to the same adreess."
1,Not happy :(,I am not happy with the Sandisk because I never got it. But I will get refund.Thanks for nothing :(Ragna
1,Would Help If I Could Unlock It,"I bought several of these memory cards because I consider Sandisk to be the ""gold standard"" for SD cards. Unfortunately all my cards were locked - I can use them on a computer, but not in a camera. I understand there's a switch on the card that locks it but it was in the unlocked position. I tried formatting them in my camera and on my computer. No luck. I didn't discover this until I was in Europe ready to take pictures on a recent vacation. Beware!"
1,Worked fine until it didn't work,"I purchased this card five months ago and used it without incident. I was happy with the amount of space on the card. Suddenly today, for no apparent reason, a message came up saying ""memory card error"". I cannot access the photos on my card with my external card reader. I cannot use the card in my camera. The photos on the card are lost, and that makes me quite sad."
3,expensive SHIPPING!,"I played around with the prices on this and found out several things. If I order this item, $11 in shipping costs is added by the third party supplier! If I get the 2G version, even two of them, those qualify for free shipping from Amazon and come out much cheaper. So check your prices on these before ordering. My hunch is that you can probably pick this 4G up cheaper at your local electronics/computer store..."
2,Beware! does not work in many cameras,"Finding that this product does not work in my one year old Canon camera I contacted the company and was given a list of cameras which do support it. This list belongs on the product description at the Amazon site. Besides the nuisance, I'll be out the $4.50 shipping cost for shipping an item requiring .59 cents postage."
1,"sd 4,0 memory card","This does not work at all in my camera it always says unusable get a new memory card. also it looks nothing like the picture they are showing because the picture is the one I use I'm not sure what they sent, but poor poor business practice to show one thing and ship another."
2,unhappy,would not work and did not return my contact about product until a week later. then they just sent a return policy recommendation which did not help because i no longer had the package it was sent in.
1,Cheap quality.,The little lock switch works 10 percent of the time. Gotta keep playing with it to unlock. W w w
1,no worky,It simply does not work. I tried everything. Thought it was formatting or something else. Made sure the lock was off. But it still did not work. Seeing how many others had the same experience I'm sending it back. You would think Amazon would get the message.
4,Fun on the run,"The SanDisk system is the only system I use to keep up with my data, In over 8years it's alway been their when I need it."
5,Scan disk 4.0 GB,"The Scan Disk 4GB is great for cameras with an incredible amount of storage capacity. I also give 5 gold stars to the seller of this product. It turned out that this scandisk disn't fit my camera and he gave me an immediate refund, no questions asked. It's great when you get really good customer service like that!"
5,Excelente,"Todo tal cual lo ofertado, sin inconveniente y muy satisfactoria la transacciòn en general. Excelente todo el proceso de principio a fin."
5,Excellent,It had never been opened and was still in the original package when I got it. Works great in my camera!
3,memoria,"muy conforme con la compra recomiendo al vendedor de este producto, llego en perfecto estado y estoy conforme con la compra"
5,4GB SDHC,It meet my expectations and provides plenty of memory for many photo's in my camera. It is also makes it easy to transfer the data tom my home computer.
5,SDHC,"Product is great, thought it didn't work properly at first, but that was my fault because I hadn't formatted it first!!Now working great. Good price, delivered quickly."
1,Was great when it worked,"Do a search on the web for 4GB SanDisk problems. Mine worked a couple weeks in a trail cam. Then I picked up 9 shots that are now inaccessible. The disk cannot be accessed, it cannot be formatted and it cannot be partitioned, cleaned or formatted using the disk part command. It's useless right now."
3,"Doesn't hold enough pictures,",I was only able to save about 4-6 photo's on this SDHC it may hold more but with my camera it was full after that many photo's.
5,"Sandisk 4GB Secure Digital SD HC Memory Card (SDSDB-4096, BULK, No Reader)","The Sandisk 4GB Secure Digital SD HC Memory Card (SDSDB-4096, BULK, No Reader) is a very reliable SD memory card and just for some bucks. Totally recommended. Thank You..."
4,Good shape on time!,"The item arrived on time and in good shape, it worked fine with my camera. I would recommend this product."
5,Sandisk,"4GB sandisk for cheap price and works very fast , I recommend this product for others to buy from Amazon.com"
5,nice little card,"Great price, They haven't given me any trouble so far and I've been putting them thru the ringer. I just can't say enough about my satisfaction with this card."
2,BEWARE - Be sure your device compatible!,Turns out my camera is not compatible with this card. The product description should make it more clear that this is different than a regular SD card. I have no idea how well it works because I can't use it!
1,becareful of this card,"Please be careful if you decide on this card; I have had 3 of them go bad on me. After I took pictures and tried to review them, a big question mark came up on my camera screen."
1,Products not ordered,"I never ordered this product, did not want the product, did not need the product, cost was only 4-5 bucks so not worth fooling with trying to get my money back."
1,SECURE DIGITAL MEMORY CARD LOCKES & WON'T OPEN,"ORDERED THIS FOR MY CANON CAMERA. AFTER INSTALLING GOT MESSAGE THAT THE CARD WAS LOCKED AND WOULD NOT OPERATE. I COULD NOT UNLOCK SO TOOK CARD TO LOCAL CAMERA STORE AND THEY COULD NOT UNLOCK, EITHER. THEY SUGGESTED I BUY NEW CARD SINCE THEY FEEL CARD IS DEFECTIVE BECAUSE IT WOULD OT UNLOCK."
1,Where is the disk?,This has not shown up. Where is the Disk? SanDisk appears to be a storage medium that is a standard and will function well if i had it.
1,Way a business should not be BEWARE PLACING AN ORDER,I went to my camera and it listed memory cards for it ordered on ireceived the memory cards for a diferent caera notified sender who said return it bur restocking fee were more than original cost of correct menory card I have sent a dozen emails with no replies. so all I can say is BEWARE WHEN YOU THINK OF PLACING AN ORDERgenefrenchko7t@yahoo.com
3,it dont look like on the pic,they charge me for $1.49 for ship and it cost them for local mail $.44. and it dont look the same as on the pic they sale it.
3,"Ok for storage, not for use in a camera","I bought this for my new digital camera. It is too slow. On occasion, my camera will blink red and freeze. At first I thought it was a low battery, but after further research I learned it was the memory card. They are not all made equal! It turns out they are rated differently by class, or MB/s, according to how fast they read/write. This one has no class rating, and should only be used for storage where speed is not an issue."
5,RECOMMEND,"I had just bought the same memory card 2gb at the store for $15 and after a month or so i realized that i needed a memory card that has a bigger memory capacity. So i looked it up here on amazon and found this 4gb memory card for half the price. IT WORKS PERFECTLY FINE, SHIPPING IS FAST, AND CHEAP PRICE. I RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE."
1,Did not work,"I never bothered to return this item, but it did not work when I received it. Tried reformatting it even, but to no avail."
1,"not working, maybe wrong","I hope to change this SD card under garanty, because it doesn't work neither with Bushnell nor with PC card reader nor camera..."
2,my own fault; i bought the wrong thing.,"Before i bought this, I had no idea there was such a thing as a 'SD HC' card, and that my camera didn't take them. Ah, well... I'm only out a couple dollars."
1,Seems funny to me,"It's very strange that I ordered this product along with the other product a the same time to the same address, but I only got the other item. Hmmmmm?"
5,Advanced Technology!,Compact storage. Too much information to analyze. So I dragged and dropped whats important. And got rid of the trash. But I'm glad I got it and leanred a lot about it. I have a San Disk reader anyone interested?! The RAM Is worth a lot!
1,Don't Know,I can not review it because the camera I bought it for has yet to be released and I can not find anywhere on Amazon when it might expected.
4,Cheap price,I bought it on deal. Very cheap and a good value of the money.It never worked for my cell phone due to the capacity limit but my brother is very happy using that product.
5,Very affordable Memory Card!,"I was really pleased with these two $GB cards i bought two of them and i don't think i'll ever get a chance to se the other one, but the price for this card is amazing, even with the horrible shipping charges it's still at a way lowers price compare to instore pricing of these cards, Great Card! Great Price! Great Quality! What more could you ask for?!!"
2,No good,"SD cards would not open in the computer for me to review any pictures, and it is very disappointing not to be able to check my the wildlife that I was trying to capture on disk."
1,Never received / cancelled / Poor Customer Service,"Received the incorrect item (Memory card for Cell phone (much smaller)1 1/2 week after ordering (?). Send back and than after I inquired about the status, I was informed that they no longer have that item. No apology, nothing! Poor, poor customer service!I was very disappointed!"
2,NOT COMPATIBLE w CANON SD400 SONY VAIO HP Printer/readers,"i bought this only to discover it is NOT compatible with most Windows XP SD readers and very limited compatiability with older digital cameras - i have a Canon sd400 which it DOES NOT work with - but i have a Canon sd770is which it does work with - my Sony Vaio desktop running Windows XP Professional does not recognize the disk but my Sony Vaio laptop running Windows Vista Business Edition does - kind of a pain in the butt - buy at your own risk - endnote: i paid [...] no joke, nice little margin of profit on that shipping fee ...."
5,Move over Visa!,This card is the no hassle card! 4 GB is huge. I've been able to take it on week long vacations and not worried about filling it up. I use the highest resolution setting on my camera about 8MB/picture and take lots of video but have never been able to fill it up.I ordered the card and it was on my door in just 3 days. They did a great job.
1,Not worth it,This product is not worth it. It doesn't come in packaging and is probably not authentic. Mine will not work at all in any of my devices. The problem is that they will not refund shipping and that is what the majority of the cost is on this. Buy this product at a store. It will be a better buy in the end.
5,It's a memory card,What more can I say other than it's a memory card that works for my new Panasonic Lumix XR1 with no issues.
4,Good purchase to expand the memory of your digital camera,"Adds a lot of space, so if you want you can leave your photos on. Good gift for someone who does not have access to a computer (yes, these people still exist!)."
2,didnt work,"I put it in my camera and didnt work, i had to buy a new one at k-mart, it was a 2 gig and it worked. So the problem wasnt my camera."
1,disappointed,"This memory card would not work. Contacted the seller with this issue but got no help. Not even an apology for defective card, Just some type of excuse for what may have occurred. We do A LOT of shopping on Amazon.com and this is the first me I have EVER had a company not take responsibility for a mistake."
1,sd card,"I tried to format thid SD Drive on my computer, whe I went to use it my computer would just state that the drive is not formatted, computer works on other drives but not this one."
4,4 G SD Cards,The cards are exactly as described and work perfectly in our cameras. They have proven to be a secure place to store pictures for long periods of time.
1,Arrived Locked,"Card arrived stuck on ""locked"". Will not work in computer or camera. Pretty disappointing even though it was only 5 bucks."
1,Came in mail locked and now dosnt work,"I ordered this card, and it came in the mail locked, and now it doesn't even work at all. I understand it's a secure card, but the owner should really disable that feature before selling."
5,Excelentes,los felicito por tan buen servicio aunque una pieza tan pequeña me llego al tiempo y de excelente calidad la recomiendo. saludos
4,Stored stuff,This item did what it's supposed to do. Stored my huge collection of visual resources that I needed for school.
4,Good photo card,"Got to go with a camera I have as a gift. Wanted to be sure got all the pieces. Been working great, have had for a year"
3,Missing Lyric?!?!,"I first bought 'All Systems Go' on TAPE. I was excited to open up this 'remastered' copy on cd (actually I accidentally ended up with TWO copies). I popped it in my cd player and when 'Love Kills' came on something strange happened. Two lines of the lyric are missing. How can this be an original recording if two of the lines of the lyric are missing? No, the cd didn't skip, it happened on both copies. It's very difficult to hear a song I've been listening to for many, many years now without two of the lines in it. It's just plain wrong."
5,Vinnie Vincent Invasion - All Systems Go,"I thought ""Invasion"" was a great album, but this one ""All Systems Go"" is even better. Don't get me wrong ""Invasion"" is still great, but ""All Systems Go"" is a gerat follow up. With Mark Slaughter being the Voice, Bobby Rock on drums, Dana Strum on Bass and Vocals and Vinnie Vincent on Guitars these guy's just tear it up on ""All Systems Go"". Ever since getting this cd it is one of my most played album's. ""Love Kills"" is my favorite song of all time and in my opinion one of the greatest power ballads ever. ""Ashes to Ashes"" is a great track to open up the album. Awesome rift in that song. From beginning to end there is not one bad song in my opinion. My personal favorites are ""Love Kills"", ""Ashes to Ashes"", and ""Dirty Rhythm"" but they are all awesome songs and this album is definetly worth it."
1,Absolutely worthless,"I bought this CD because of 'Nightmares-on-Wax' and I must say that the two numbers they produce are about the best this cd has to offer. The rest is pure JUNK. Despite of other reviews on this product that makes you think that this is greatest 'Chill Out' you come across (that's the reason I bought it in the first place, it will not happen again) don't buy this until you have a good idea what's on it. It's very commercial and non inspiring."
5,The Gateway,"This album (sorry, I'm old and got it on vinyl to start) is a great bridge from the earlier, hook-laden songs from Something/Anything and Runt and the middle years works like Todd. There are straight up singles like 'Just One Victory' and 'I Don't Want to Tie You Down' along with longer, complex songs like 'Zen Archer'. Granted, this music is best absorbed if the listener is in a transcendent state (bourbon or beer will do), but all of the tracks are consistently higher quality Todd."
5,Rundgren's best work,This has always been one of my favorite albums. I've owned the vinyl for 20+ years and just bought the CD. I've lent the CD to many of my 20 something co workers and they are just blown away by the production and the color. Sure it has a few rough transitions but when you consider the era when it was done you have to give Todd credit for breaking new ground. The original work is some of his best and his tributes to R&B and broadway are excellent. This Album deserves a good listen by anyone who likes music of any form.
3,Nothing Special,"If you're an avid Rundgren fan, which I'm not, this might be a great CD. I was less than impressed with the sound quality... not bad, but less dynamic than I'm used to. There's a lot of music here (22 songs), and most of them are listenable. I just couldn't get very excited about any of them. Compared with the ""Very Best of"" CD this was a disappointment."
4,Revisiting my youth,"I listened and love d this cd in the 70's and it was such a trip to dig it again. What with all the Tyler fanfare, the fact is Todd raised Liv Tyler and I think he is a genius with sound. My dad is a working musician at 83 so I know the sounds..."
2,i tried and tried to get it....,"ok,Ive had this lp for about 15 years and played it then and quickly put it away.I love Todds first three solo albums filled with geat productions,upbeat music,power pop brillance.I was on the amazon reviews yesterday and saw ungodly amount of praise and joy for this album.so....... ! listened again....perfect vinyl copy....through a great pair of headphones....a good buzz...at night......and got a headache.It starts out promising but the production is godawful...the songs are coy at best...pale beach boy rip-offs...that unnessasary medley(come on you can write,todd!!)a swirling mess!!This is NOT a psychedelicmasterpiece...only another overdosed musician with to much time on his hands.sorrrrry!!t"
2,Don't Purchase the MP3 Download,"One of Todd's greatest works ever is AWATS. However, the MP3 download ruins the original flow of the album by breaking up each track. If you are a Todd purist (if not, go away) you need to purchase the vinal or CD version. The download version is a waste on money."
1,The worst book ever written for Albania,I guess the author of this book has visited Albanian mountains only form the helicopter windows.... they are beautiful and wild of course but the way you can see the Albanian tradition and the culture is not only the negative side.Many foreigners that visited Albania for some reasons read this book and they were really disappointed with this writer....I wouldn't suggest this book to the new arrivals in Albania...If you wanna know about Albania traditions you better read Edith Durham Books ...they are wonderful..I wish Mr. Catver would visit Albania and update his book....Thank you
4,This is a good starting point!,"This book is well worth reading. If only to learn how NOT to judge other human beings! Nevertheless it is well written, quiet funny at times, very inaccurate much of the time, but manages to give an idea of the nobility, the dignity, the kindness and generosity of an extremely poor nation. I lived and worked in Albania for seven months."
4,An excellent Third Book to Read on Albania,"Having visited Albania several times and hunted similar themes, I found Carver's picture well in line with my own. It was insights to some of the 'whys' which caught me the most. He gets a hearty well done for doing what I had hoped to in 1992 when visiting as a journalist."
4,energizer cv3010 vhs rca/hitachi c camcorder battery,nice battery cause they are hard to find....although the last one i bought didn't last a year and i didnt use the camcorder all THAT much.... i was always charging it and it wouldnt keep a charge.. it lasted about 8 months....so find one that's relatively cheap cause you'll be buying one in the not so distant future..unless i just got a lemon of a battery........but if you wanna use your camcorder i guess you have no choice........
4,RCA/Hitachi C Camcorder Battery (Energizer),Good replacement for what is becoming a hard to find battery especially for those with a full size VHS camcorder that still works and is still very usable in today's digital world.
5,Practical Advice Abounds!,"Patricia Fry's book on writing is quite simply one of the most practical books on the subject I've ever read. What makes it so unique is that Ms. Fry packs into 66 pages what many books on the subject fail to shed light on in several times as many pages! Ms. Fry gives hands-on, approachable advice on a number of pertinent matters that freelance and wannabe freelance writers take to heart: finding article ideas, self-promotion, selling rights, and handling rejection. Clearly the tips she shares with readers have worked for her, as she has made her living as a freelance writer for years."
4,great music!,"I saw regurgitator opening for Melvins & Helmet on the aftertaste tour in 1997, and I'm hooked 4 life. Let me tell you, these guys are one of the best groups performing live and they are just three fellas!Do yourself a favor and buy this CD, you won't regret it never."
4,"Great size, Good water absorbtion","Good Price, Good amount of water absorption, but will not leave your car bone dry.I found this towel best for pulling 90% of the water off large SUVs and large trucks in very short time.I still recommend this Item"
2,This book is junk,"I'm a UC Davis student who took the plant biology course that uses this book. The professor doesn't even follow the book because it's so bad. It's unorganized, confusing, and useless for my class. Even some of the illustrations in the book are wrong. Don't buy this book if you just plan to learn plant biology. If you have to buy this book because course requirement, good luck"
4,Great Band!,"After reading the only other review here, I felt the need to defend The Goodies. I saw them play several years ago in Birmingham, AL, and was blown away by the band charisma and musicianship. They played for 3 and a half hours, each song great. The girls swooning over the lead singer. The album ""Greatest Hits"" doesn't really capture the live effect they have, but it's still pretty great. It's over the top, eccentric, and unusual. I don't know about you, but that's what the best music sounds like. ""Plastic"", ""Mr. Francisco"", and ""Edge"" are standouts on the album."
1,Bought it in error,"I thought I was buying a record by a very bad British comedy group, so bad they were good. In fact this is a very bad group of amateur musicians who should have stayed in the garage where they recorded this. Oh well - serves me right for not looking into it properly. Don't give up your daytime jobs guys."
4,George Wallace vhs,"Great movie, George Wallace realized it later in life that all people just equality no matter what color.Sorry to say, it took a bullet to make him see his unjust ways."
4,Sinise Shines Again,"Gary Sinise has to be the most underrated actor of our time, and it's a real tragedy. He is one of the most talented people in show business today, certainly equal to Tom Hanks or Bruce Willis. He's at his best in ""George Wallace,"" John Frankenheimer's look at the detested former governer of Alabama. Like he did in ""Truman,"" Sinise makes the title character out to be a human being, not an over the top racist or evil caricature. The film doesn't pass judgement on Wallace, but leaves the viewers to decide what they thought of him. Frankenheimer does a capital job of recreating the south in 1960's, and the realistic settings help make the movie more believable. While some historical facts are a little off, the film captures the essence of Wallace's complicated life superbly."
5,George Wallace,A well done piece. If you like to see some history about civil rights and how some people can try to hold it back this is a good show. It shows Wallace may have been after power more then being truely prejudice but had to portray prejudice to get the power.
2,History distorted by hollywood,If you want to know the basics of George Wallace then this film is fine. But if you want to know true historical facts go somewhere else. This movie creates characters and scenes that never happened. Anybody intersted in true historic interpretation should not turn to hollywood. This is not a good source to judge the Wallace factor in American politics or the turbulent times this film focuses on. END
1,Terrible!,"I don't know what was worse, the acting or the history. The film was just one big hit piece on Wallace, and the only fair portrayal in the film was Mare Winningham's playing of Governor Lurleen. If you believe anything is sacred, don't buy this film!"
5,"my favourite album, period.","I've owned this CD for around 2 years now, and in all honesty I can truly say that this album is possibly the GREATEST album of the 90s.For all those who thought that ""Issues"" by Korn was full of emotion and frustration, then tracks like ""What I've Wanted To Say"" and ""Job's Eyes"" will make you think on a whole different wavelength.An album for all occasions- parties, romantic backing music.... You can't go wrong. Jonah's voice is beautiful also."
5,The best band you never heard,"Tin Cans with strings to you, is an album by the Sacramento based Far. This album is just oozing emotion and feelings. It is very smooth and fluctuates from quick songs like Love American Style, which questions what we see on T.V. and how much of it we believe, to the slow, beautifully painful Job's eye(the albums highlight) that almost brings me to tears to this day. It has an edge for real rockers,but is so down low and grooving that any true music fan could appreciate. Unfortunately very few people know of this band which I consider to be like one of the greatest bands currently out there. Overall this cd is fabulous and should be listened to by all."
3,A lot like Chevelle's Point #1,"I'm not use to writing music reviews, but I love rock and Chevelle is on of my favorite bands ever, so when a friend recommended Far, it made me happy to hear a familiar sound to a beloved band. There are a few songs that I really loved, but some were too slow and didn't seem to go anywhere. I feel a good song can take you on a journey. And I agreed with the comment about the vocals getting drowned out at times. I also felt that his voice lacked dimension in general. There are some rockin' riffs, but I'd prefer an album with a little more guidance and polish."
4,Definitely worth it.,"Lolita Storm is the voice of an entirely new generation of hardcore, screaming out vile lyrics above incredibly distorted drum and bass melodies. ""Get Back"" is one of the most amazing music experiences I have ever had. Songs are addicting, and leave you with that ""craving more"" state of mind. Like potato chips, you can never have just one."
5,Genuis,"I have listened to a number of different remixes of this track, and i must say.. even though DJ Lars Holte's version on ITWT003 was good,DJ Johan Geilens version on ITWT004 was the best ever,,, probably the best trance track i have ever heardGET THIS TRACK NOW.. BUY: DJ JOHAN GEILEN - IN TRANCE WE TRUST 004 (black hole)"
4,Work it Mya,Even though the record company scrapped this cdits a good cdmya is working itshe has left the record company and nowis independentI can't wait to see what she will do nowa new song has leaked on the netits good called Ego Trippin
1,Really bad experience. Beware of bad shipping from Amazon,"Ordered Horizon treadmill CT61 from Amazon, received in broken box with broken plastic pieces from all sides. I cannot figure out what belongs were as its in pieces. When called Amazon Customer service, they told me to buy a new box and pack it up for pick-up which will be scheduled in 5-7 business days. Customer representative was very rude and just mean. Be aware to spend more time hustling with Amazon folks rather spending on treadmill."
4,Good deal,The treadmill and the manufacturer have been solid in performance and service. The motor cover was damaged during shipping and one of the core pods (pulleys used for resistance)was defective. The company immediately shipped out new replacements and have since followed up to check on my satisfaction. The machine works well and is quiet as described...easy to walk or run on...I like the little extras!
4,Great product for a low price ...,"I purchased this treadmill for my cardiac exercise. This was my first treatmill purchase. So I did not know what to expect from a low-priced treatmill. Well, this turns out to be a great bargain. It runs smooth and quiet. It does not take up much space, but it is long enough for running. I like the spring coushions. Only one down side was that it made some (unidentified) noise when I used the incline while I was running. Overall, i am very happy with this product."
1,Don't Buy Estes - Buy Quest - Igniters make ALL the difference,"It pains me to write this as I had Estes rockets in my youth and loved them. But.... My kids are now old enough and we got this rtf kit with an extra pack of engines/igniters/waddings. Out of the 30 igniters, we had 2 sucessful launches. The rest of the time the igniter shorted or failed to work. My kids were understandably disappointed. I called Estes and they were supposed to send new igniters - never came. So I tried the new Quest igniters (the ones with the glass bead) on the Estes engines (had 28 of them). 100% sucess launch rate.I am now a 100% Quest supporter. Good educational web site too."
3,Let's not get carries away . . .,"I bought this record as a cut-out in a Woolworth's in Palm Springs, Calif. in 1972. I think I payed something like 99 cents for it. This group was strongest in its instrumental facets, especially on the first side. But a lot of the record just sounds like noodling with no idea or direction of what to do. Like they didn't really have enough good material to record an album, Lord knows why they went and put out a double LP, and Columbia let `em! [ the old John Hammond-influenced Columbia could often indulge their artists like this- to their credit!] The singer is not very could- he's obviously intent on duplicating Beefheart. The instrumental jamming on side 1 showed a lot of potential, but anything by Frank Zappa or the Nice or Alman Brothers from around this time shows a lot more involvement in the composition phase of putting together music. `Halifax' has funny lyrics."
5,Music to Think,"Well, folks, ""Music to Eat"" is an amazing record at all levels: artistic boldness, superb musicianship, top-notch compositional skills, originality and firepower, conjuring an overall, neverending atmosphere of adventure and impact. Zappaesque and beefheartian echoes are surely present here, but The Hampton Grease Band manages to combine those influences with a remarkable creativity."
3,game too short,I really enjoyed playing this game. I finished it quickly and have been replaying it over and over. I just wish it was a bit longer.
3,It's OK,"If you like search and find games, I imagine you'll like this one. The puzzles after the search part are repetitive, and you'll often finding yourself looking for the same thing multiple times, which is disappointing."
3,Not what I expected...,"It's not so much a mystery as a search and find, puzzle solving type game. It only took a few hours to complete... it was fun, but too easy and got repetitive after a short time. I'd play another game in the series, but I certainly wouldn't pay more than 5 or 10 dollars for it."
5,Life Lessons From Corrie,Was very happy to find this book. I have a copy but wanted to find one for my very good friend! Thanks
4,"Different, but some good tracks.","DJ Sammy's Heaven album is a good ablum to listen to something different. I like some of the tracks such as Beautiful Smile, California Dreamin', Heaven, Sunlight, and The Boys of Summer. The other tracks are okay, but I can live without."
1,TRITE,"This album is a travesty. Processed, unimaginative, bland. Do not waste your time. Do not waste your money. (Alas, there was not an option for ZERO stars. . .)Keep searching. . .there are better things out there!"
1,Makes a great coaster,"Picked up this trash at the store and 10 minutes later, after tracking through the entire thing, it took a back seat in my garbage can. Well done Sammy, way to release a horendous fart into the Trance genre."
1,Terrible,"Do not waste your money on this trash. DJ Sammy stinks the place up with all but 1-2 songs on this CD. I remember when i bought this CD thinking ""All right, this looks ok..."" 10 minutes later after tracking through every song on the disc, it took a back seat in my trash can."
4,It didn't hit me until I saw him live....,"To tell you the truth I was frankly ... getting tired of these songs being over played on the local radio station.But one night I was on the job at a local club that hosts concerts and Dj sammy and Lonna came to perform. THEY WERE AWESOME!! the cd actually does little justice for they're actual energy and enthusiasm. Once I heard them live I went right out and bought this cd because I really love that song ""Beautiful Smile."" Loona is beautiful and Dj Sammy is energetic and lovable.They took the time to sign autographs for everyone waiting and even took pics with me and my friends.. but anyway... the cd is a great reminder of a great night. You should get this one to start you off... shop around for more of DJ SAMMY and LOONA as well!!!"
4,The title song is really what stands out,"I really love the single for ""Heaven"" and was looking forward to this album to come out. A lot of the songs are quirky and upbeat (especially the covers of Don Henley's ""The Boys of Summer"" and of The Mamas and the Papas's ""California Dreaming""), but remind me of songs by pop groups like the Cardigans and Eiffel 65. I was more under the impression that the songs would be more like ""Heaven,"" which is a true techno song in its own right.I still really like ""Heaven"" though, and the album features a great remix of it. The remix alone makes the album worth buying (even more so if you're a fan of the single), hence 4 stars instead of just 3."
2,Heaven? Hardly,"While DJ Sammy's remake of the Bryan Adams power ballad 'Heaven' is the cheesiest guilty pleasure of the summer, the same cannot be said of the accompanying album. Soulless eurodisco production and equally banal singing suck the life out of even the album's most tolerable tracks('Take Me Back To Heaven','Unbreakable'), with several of the tracks sounding so identical in nature that he could sue himself for copyright infringement. And those who think the kewpie-doll singing of Do on the title track make Paula Abdul seem like a natural born diva need only listen to vocalist Loona on tracks like 'Sunlight' and a very misguided remake of 'California Dreamin' to realize she's as good as it gets here. Those who love 'Heaven' would best be served by seeking out the maxi-single. Otherwise, this HEAVEN feels alot more like hell."
2,Trance for kiddies,"I went bowling to one of those alleys where all of a sudden the lights went down, a disco ball would spray, and some really safe, mindless trance/freestyle music would come up while bowling. I thought that was pretty cool just for the effect and didn't care what music was playing.That might be the only condition which I could tolerate ""Heaven."" It's trance for kids under 10. Think of Kylie with a computer. I can't imagine being in a club and all of a sudden this came on. I'd probably leave."
5,love this album,DJ Sammy had done the best techno album ever... I highly recommend this CD to all those that do love Techno
3,good,Decent album but I have heard better. I would probably stick to buying single songs instead of the whole album.
1,Please Ignore This,"This is what gives dance music a bad reputation, Dj's/Groups that just make cheep remakes of old hits, add a dance sound and some mediocre singer, and tada they got some airplay on the radio without really doing much themselves. I'm a huge fan of dance music but i can't really stand this kind of b-dance. ""Heaven"" a classic Bryan Adams song is better on its original version so is Mama's and the Papa's ""California Dreaming"" and Don Henley's ""Boys of Summer"". The rest are just fillers, you know that kind of songs no one would pay attention to anyway. This whole album is really bad and it's sad that Dj Sammy who's not even half as talented as many Dance Artists out there could get airplay making cheep cover versions."
3,Pleasant Back Ground Music,"Ok, ok, quit your griping. It's not the best, but at least it's not the worse. I didn't buy it here, but as my only CD souvenier of Europe this fall, I have to say I'm pleased. I'm listening to it now; I needed something peppy after listening to industrial goth all morning, and this fits the bill. Besides, this is the only way I would be caught listening to anything even remotley associated with Bryan Adams or Oldies."
1,Trance???,"Horrible!! The ""Heaven"" song was good for the first few listens but then I realized what I was listening to and I had to smack myself a few times as punishment. I was stunned when I saw ""Heaven"" on a progessive trance cd!! This isnt trance..this is some guy that digs out old cd's from his collection and plays a preprogramed CASIO keyboard beat to it. To have him on the same cd as real DJ's like Paul Van Dyk, DJ Tiesto, Timo Maas, and Oakey is a disgrace. Dont even get me started on Yanou. I just checked my watch and her 15 minutes of fame is up. I went to a club that had her performing. She sang the ""Heaven"" song without DJ Sammy, which wasnt the worst part. SHE SANG THE DAMN SONG TWICE IN A ROW!! Why you may ask?? Cause all of her other songs are crap. Alright...thats enough bitterness from me today."
4,"Review for ""Heaven"" by DJ Sammy","Heaven is a very good album by DJ Sammy. It is one of his first albums. I very much enjoy his main song ""Heaven"" which is the main song for this album. After listening to the whole CD, I found out that there are other songs besides his main one that is good too. Songs like ""Sunlight"" and ""The Boys of Summer"" are some of the top songs right behind ""Heaven"".The rate of DJ Sammy's beats along with the way the song is mixed into a techno song with a regular song. This puts DJ Sammy as a different kind of DJ unlike the regular DJ who uses countless times of the same beats along with the same words in the background. DJ Sammy's unique style actually has a blend of several beats going at the same time along with a real voice in the background. The way things are mixed together produces a great song with a lasting memory of his songs in my head."
2,DJ Sammy - Too Far from Heaven,"DJ Sammy's two celestial ""Heaven"" hits are the only songs on the ""Heaven"" CD with any real celestial magic. The rest of the CD is a disappointing revelation of DJ Sammy's lack of inspiration beyond the earthly bounds of standard euro-sounds. Remakes are the name of his game, and his own original creations are euro-bland. He tries to recycle several other classics like ""California Dreamin'"", but the magic is gone. Besides ""Heaven"", the CD's most redeeming sounds come from his remake of ""Boys of Summer"", which is still far from heaven. The ""El Condor Pasa"" remake at times sounds like the type of Asian muzak you would hear in a Chinese restaurant. If you love the sound of ""Heaven"", buy the single; if you want to slip the surly bonds of one-hit-wonderdom, try CDs like ATB's Movin' Melodies or DJ Encore's Intuition."
4,entertaining and light-hearted,"decided to buy another copy of this, since my original got lost in the process of my 4 different moves in 3 years. if that doesn't explain that it's a pretty good cd, i'm not sure what will.most of the tracks on this cd are upbeat enough that you want to move, and many of them give me a little lift-me-up when i'm feeling down.now, i can respect those of you who don't like this cd because it has a few ""rip-off remakes"", but let's be honest people--just about every artist in any type of popular music right now has remade at least one song during their career.i'd suggest at least giving it at try. if you don't like it--sell it back to someone like me. :)"
4,da best review on this damn list,"dj sammy's cd was great. if ur into all of that fast beat stuff and enjoy that certain sound and style that she has, then you'll love the CD. i personally don't really care for it, but i bought the CD because of the slow versions of ""heaven"" that they had in it. that song is so sweet!!! but anyways, it's a pretty good CD overall... i'm not in love with it or obsessed with it like some other people are in their reviews, but i'd give it a thumbs up and recommend it to someone considering it."
3,Eh.,"This CD is...well...okay. You should definetely check out tracks 1, 2, 3, and 4. But the rest, are, well, eh. Ohh well, if you're a big trance fan, you'll love this CD, but if not, it's average."
1,Do yourself a favor--avoid this garbage.,"I normally wouldn't spend the time to write a review, but this album's utter lack of artistic merit has compelled me to do so. I have no beef with the original songs on which Sammy's tracks are based (I like many of them), nor do I have a problem with techno/trance music (I own a lot of it). The problems I do have with this record are (1) the utter lack of originality, (2) the awful singing, and (3) the generic, pre-programmed beats. I do applaud Sammy's business acumen. The secret? Take a song you know people like, have someone sing it (who is so bad she would get booed off any karaoke stage), put it to a simplistic ""trance"" beat (just edgy enough to make people feel like they're hip), and peddle it to commercial radio stations as something people will like instantly (because they've already heard it. Oh, the horror."
1,DURACELL AA24 PROCELL Professional Alkaline Battery,I bought these batteries to use w/ my xbox remote but did not work most were nearly dead right out of the box. Some only worked on smaller remote and some kids toys. Out of the whole box only 4 batteries worked.
4,procell AA batts 24 ct,Batteries work as advertised. I think this will be the last item I review due to the fact I have to write 20 or more words in the review!!!
1,NO,"WOULD'NT BUY AGAIN, I GOT THESE FOR THE LAPTOP TOYS FOR MY GRAND KIDS AND THE DID'NT LAST 2 DAYS...RIP OFF FOR MY MONEY...."
5,Great!,"These came quickly, they work perfectly, and they are prepackaged in smaller boxes of 4 so they don't end up rolling around everywhere. Wonderful price!"
5,"the price is right, and the batteries are good quality","ive been buying this procell line of duracell for a while now, and for the price and longevity I will continue to buy them."
1,Never went through a box of batteries so quickly!,"This product may be for you depending on what you want. Maybe you are in need of a vacuum chamber for electrons, that can practically suck them out of the air and throw energy down into a black hole. Or perhaps you are playing a prank on somebody who needs their batteries for some type of life-sustaining medical equipment and you will get a real kick out of it when your victim goes into shock. But what you WON'T get a kick out of, electrically speaking, are these batteries."
3,price a little too high,If you could drop price by 2.00 I would buy 4 more of these packagesand recredit my card by 2.00 I found cheaper on linedel
1,You don't actually get 24 batteries!,"Ordered these batteries because I go through a ton of them and thought it'd be best to start buying in some bulk. Much to my surprise after opening the box, there were only 20 batteries in there!! The interior box was all smashed up and there were 5 boxes of 4 batteries, and I'm no mathematician, but last I checked 5 X 4=20. It wasn't worth sending back everything and waiting another week and a half over 4 batteries, so I'll just be bitter about it and never order batteries from this place again. So beware if you're thinking you're getting 24 batteries, because you won't!"
5,cheap batteries!,"packaging was a little beat up, but that does not matter to me.I've tested 4 batteries so far. They work just fine!Exp says 2017.Can't beat the price."
2,Worthless,No longevity at all.Maybe 10 shots worth in a digital camera.Don't waste your time.False economy.Bad deal.
4,batteries,We use these batteries at church for the lapel and cordless mics. We've had no complaints so far! We probably go through 4-5 boxes a year...
4,There great,I bought these batteries because they were going to be perfect for all the hobbies and games im in to they have a pertty good life span but I think regular Duracell might be a little better overall great deal.
2,Don't last like copper tops!,"I have triple cellular blinds on 9 large windows for insulating as well as sun protection purposes. They all are battery operated and are opened and closed again every day. I have gone through 6 - 24 packs of these ""Pro"" batteries now after having used copper tops for an equal amount of time. The copper tops would last almost a year and a half (on average). These Pro batteries are lasting 6 to eight months to do the same job. Obviously, I am switching back to copper tops. They cost more but the time to switch out batteries cost something too, especially on the high up blinds."
1,They leak and make a mess and may ruin the clock.,"Twice I have had these batteries leak in a electronic atomic clocks. The first time there was corrosion and a mess. The second time there was a mess and the clock would not work when I replaced the batteries. I was almost going to throw it away but I scratched the connections deep and the clock started to work again. Then there was acid on my hands and all over the table. Better pay more money rather than take a chance on something that is going to leak and make a mess. Even cheap generic batteries when they leak did not make this much of a mess. These were working clocks on my wall, not something sitting in a drawer somewhere. They do seem to have a long life though, if you do not mind having to clean up a mess when it is time to replace them."
4,very nice product,The only concern was the box. Its different from the one shown on the picture. Using the batteries and everything is pretty fine!
2,Over-hyped -- not a good battery,"I ordered several boxes of AA and AAA size Duracell Procells because I wanted to replace batteries in many different devices less often. Some are indoor, some are outdoor, all various consumer devices, slow drain and high drain. After going though at least half of them now--at least a couple of dozen since December '09, I can say for sure that they last far less than half the time of any other good quality battery. Copper-top Duracells, Energizer Max, Rayovac Alkaline, etc. all have lasted much longer (in the same devices) in my experience. The Procells I have have a 2016 expiration date, so 'old batteries' isn't the problem. I think these batteries are for professionals/companies who have lots of equipment and have to change batteries often anyway and can't keep track of all of it closely, so that they don't notice how quickly these batteries expire. Anyone that pays attention to run-life and overall cost of replacing batteries wouldn't keep buying these."
5,Good price for good batteries - nice packaging too.,The package came with a piece of scotch tape on the lid of the box - probably to keep it from opening during transit. The batteries are packaged in 8 mini-boxes of 4 batteries each for a total of 24 batteries (8 x 4). Pretty nice and keeps the batteries seperated as much as possible and/or for purposes of placing them near places for emergency use like my mini-flashlights and LED lights so that I can find my larger flashlights and what not.I tested all the batteries with a volt meter and measured them all to be 1.649 to 1.651 volts as I would expect most new batteries to measure.
1,Quality and Charge is Hit and Miss,I've ordered these batteries on two different occasions. The first package performed at least as well as an off-the-shelf Duracell batteries from the store. My most recent order however was a completely different and very negative experience. The batteries from that order had almost no charge at all in them and in fact couldn't power a computer keyboard or mouse for more than two or three days before they completely lost all charge. Your mileage may vary but I won't be taking the chance on these batteries in the future.
