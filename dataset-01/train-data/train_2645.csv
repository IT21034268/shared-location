3,Good but definitely not their best,"I've been a Fighting Gravity/Boy O Boy fan since I first saw them open for the Kinks at the boathouse in Norfolk, VA. Forever=1 Day is a good solid CD but it lacks the energy and sheer fun of some of their earlier releases such as Shiskabob and No Stopping No Standing. I especially wish the horns were more prominent on this album. This is a good CD but it's definitely not their best work"
4,A must have for any music lover!,"If you ever get the chance to see these guys perform live, TAKE IT!"
3,Arrived later and in poor condition,The valve arrived 1 week after the deadline date. It was shipped in old carton that didn't belong to the item. We had to find a replacement valve at a local dealer because we couldn't wait any longer. The valve was finally returned. This was not a pleasant transaction experience.
2,You'll get what you paid for,"In short, this radio specs are misleading. There are plenty of good features that comes with the radio. The the radio is not up to specification listed. The radio advertise output of 2W ERP, with test equipment I can only measure about .75W. using the included NiMH batteries. Good part about that is it will not drain the batteries as fast as expected.NOTE: A GMRS license is require and that cost another $85.It defeats the purpose of getting a higher power radio service like GMRS. Mind as well spend the money and get a real GMRS radio like the Kenwood TK-3101 or not spend the money and get a plain FRS radio for less money."
5,Great for giving pills to the dog,My dog loves these treats and they are small and soft so it is easy to shove a pill into them.
2,"Dog Liked Them, His Stomach Did Not","The dog loved these treats while doing his therapy exercises but they reeked havoc on his digestive system. Vomited after one day and had diarrhea for days after that. I stopped using them after right away. Note: The treats I purchased did not have corn syrup listed in the ingredients. I have seen some advertised with and without. So, if your dog's stomach can handle them, they are great. If not, take a pass. BTW he ate a different brand of liver product treats with no problem."
3,For the Richter aficionado and student of the arts,"I am mad about Gerhard Richter. Especially when it comes to his masked and stripped oil paintings. Therefore it makes sense that I would have to acquire this little book full of detail panels of Richter's painting. That's it. That's why you would buy this thing. It's straightforward and there's really no other use for it once you are done staring. It gets filed under ""reference"" in my library. When someone wants to see what it is about this German painter that get me so juiced, and we don't want to run out to the Saint Louis Art Museum and I don't have Sonic Youth's Daydream Nation lying around (or even if I do) then I let them flip through this little art book."
5,I love it.,"It just what he wanted,and it works good. Thank You. he use it when he go walking,just like the one he had before."
3,Auto reverse is why I bought it,"Auto reverse is why I bought it. My thoughts on the player is that it is average - you get what you pay for!Ever since Auto reverse was develop it was the best thing since 8-track tapes, mind you at that time. I still have cassettes and enjoy listening to them at times. What is so annoying when the tape reached the end and stop while you're driving or in the shower-not while driving of course. Having to flip the cassette is either dangerous or inconvenient. Anyway more on the player, battery life is too short, reason I buy rechargeable's. When you want to rewind or forward you don't know the direction of the tape is going, no counter. Awkward to find controls and functions. lastly,the player drags if the tape is a 90 minute or a worn out tape, the drive is weak to say the least."
1,Caution: Contains corrupt version of March Slave,"This score is one of the rare problem scores in the Dover series. They have basically photo-offset from the old Soviet editions. In March Slave, the Russians edited out the Czarist hym material that Tchaikovsky quotes in the piece and substituted innocuous filler, with a footnote to an appendix containing the original material. The Doverites, not understanding what they were doing, leave in the footnote (which is in Russian, naturally) but omit the appendix. Anyone trying to use the score of March Slave with a recording or to prepare a performance will discover this problem. (Note - for a correct score of March Slave, get the Eulenberg pocket score and compare....)"
1,Inaccurate Scores,"As an avid musician, I have taken great pains, through research, time and money, to purchase high quality scores with which to hone my craft. Unfortunately, this score has fallen into the category of a true lemon. The other readers' comments regarding Marche Slave and the 1812 Overture are substantial and on target.Specifically, the 1812 Overture's is rife with errors; the most glaring of which is the incorrect melody in the low-brass and low strings during the finale section in combination with the alteration of the most recognizable theme in the rest of the orchestra. I have great respect for Dover and their editions. I own dozens of them. This one, however, receives two thumbs down from me because of the gross errors. If you would like a quality edition of this work, try the Eulenberg edition as suggested by the another reader. Happy Hunting!"
1,1812 OVERTURE HAS DEFAULTS,"Please do not take this the wrong way, but I found some repeats of the final section of this opus and when the cannons go off on the cds that I have listened to, while I follow a long with the orchestra, Dover repeated many measures. So, these past two days I had to figure out the right places to mark when the cannons go off. I had to mark X's where it is repeated. The cannon notation in this score is off, so I fixed that in my edition. It is still a good study guide if you want to become a conductor, when I graduate out of college I would like to become a conductor of a major city symphony orchestra."
4,Fabulous!,"This amazing book describes some of the greatest fiascoes and acts of silliness in the Twentieth Century. These include:The Amphicar -- which is both a bad car and a bad boatThe Flying Car -- which is both a bad car and a bad airplaneThe Flying Sub -- the US Navy actually spent money to develop this turkeySmokeless Cigarettes -- not that tobacco is bad for you, as RJR assures usNew Coke -- a marketing phoenix or roasted chicken?Fallout Shelters -- take the fun out of survivalThe Edsel -- synonymous with failureKudzu -- if this was the answer, what was the problem? and did we need to solve it?and Live Goldfish Swallowing -- no commentThe only thing missing from this list of marketing mayhem is my favorite gimmick from the decade of the Silly Seventies: the pet rock!Oh, what an inexcusable omission! Somehow I will learn to live with myself and my disappointment."
4,Took a while to arrive,"but the used hard bound edition was in good shape. A bit of sun damage. But for the price, I won't complain TOO much. I thought the photographs of the techniques could have been clearer-so often it looks like a tangle of laundry in the dryer (a common fault with aikido manuals). This could easily be remedied by having one person in light dogi (forget the hakama, that obscures the stance)and the other person in a dark dogi. However, with those minor quibbles, I still recommend the book highly."
2,"Lousy pictures, poor production quality","The pictures illustrating the moves are dim and small. They didn't shoot enough pictures in many sequences, leaving gaps in the pictures and making you wonder what happened in between them. The aikoda wear hakama, making it hard for you to see their feet. Save your money and buy a far better illustrated and photographed book like Gozo Shioda's ""Total Aikido: The Master Course."""
2,Another 80's one hit wonder.,"The 80's was most certaintly one of those decades where pretty much every genre of music was fantastic. However, you still had those one hit artist who's songs would still be remembered and in this case this particular artist was one of those. ""Rain"" was Oran Juice Jones only hit. I happen to have this vinyl sitting somewhere at my house in one of my stacks, but I could not possibly bring myself to pay a steep price for this cd with just that one good song on it. I have that one hit single on a compillation and that will have to do."
5,A Wonderful Book for Many Disciplines,"The target audience for this text resides in art or anthropology departments. Because it is often seen through those specializations its influence is less than its deserts.It stems from a structuralist orientation but in a dimension that school rarely considers. Since structuralism tends to think of the passage through time as just the instance (""parole"") of a simultaneous expressive system (""langue""), it misses Kubler's insight that time too can be thought of as a dimension of a trans-era historical structure. As in evolution in biology, all temporal fields then become suject to formal relational analysis.In addition to its insights, the book is lucid, brief, and articulate. It has the benefits of theory without the ponderous vocabulary and tortured syntax that sometimes mars that field."
2,Juvenile Pretensions Flatten Good Writing,"Scott Heim's writing is at times beautifully visual and graphic, and yet in this novel, the story is so preposterous his art is obscured. The characters all engage in completely ridiculous behavior that is meant to be read with grim shock and guilty, ghoulish pleasure, but which will make more discerning readers roll their eyes. This book also personifies the laughable trend in gay fiction: if there is death and depravity and self-loathing, then it's lit. If there is not, then it's not. The finale of this book is especially outrageous; you can feel Heim reaching for the most grotesque things possible in order to top himself. One part of the book I did love was the female character's past as one of those dirty little girls in class who doesn't even realize why she behaves the way she does. More character study on that line would have improved this book immeasurably."
2,I'm Left Wanting More,"I'd not recommend this book. When I put the book down today for the last time I was angry. Angry that I wasted my time with a juvenile story of twisted desire and obsession. IN AWE did keep my attention with an interesting main character. However, the plot is ridiculous and reads like a made for TV movie. I'm ready for novels that say something new, and this one does nothing but entertain the masses. Skip it."
1,UGH,"Just finished this. I agree with other reviewers that trying for the ""artsy gold"" was really just a pretensious attempt to be recognized as A Serious Artiste. Get over yourself. His first book at least held the reader's interest. I fear Mr. Heim is In Awe of himself."
4,Poetry!,"Scott Heim started out as a poet, and you can sure tell here! Beautiful evocations of emotion, loneliness, friendship, love, and the weird/beautiful/scary Midwestern landscape. Also the landscape of the midwestern mind. All tied together artfully. Some of the most ordinary moments are some of the most stunning"
4,BRIGHT FREEDOM'S SONG,I liked Bright Freedom's Song because the author used powerful and strong words. The book told a lot of informatin about the Underground Railroad. I could't put the book down because I just wanted to find out what happens next. So if you like books about the Underground Railroad you should read Bright Freedom's Song by Gloria Houston.
4,VCI!!!!,"Amazon does not have a listing for the VCI DVD-R edition, which is the one I have seen. I have not seen the Alpha because I refuse to buy their products as they started using a superimposed logo around 2005-2006. This VCI Kermit Maynard Doule Feature includes ""Red Blood of Courage"" and ""Roaring Six Guns"", both Ambassador releases. According to records, they don't appear to be edited, but both features do have some annoying splices breaking up dialogue. Unless I find them super cheap, I will be cautious about purchasing. At least the titles are original."
5,I can't get these children out of my mind...,"I was introduced to Kate Wilhem through her Barbara Holloway books. I knew Ms. Wilhelm also writes Science Fiction which is not a genre I read, but I ran across ""The Good Children"" on the 'to be shelved' cart at the library and was intrigued by the premise. Once I started reading I just couldn't put it down. Normally well disciplined in putting a book away at bedtime, I was up until well past 2:00am finishing ""The Good Children"". The four siblings are so well written I felt like I knew each of them. Don't pay attention to those who complain about the implausible ending - the book has to wind down, it just couldn't go on forever. This is a GREAT book and I will, for sure, be checking out more Kate Wilhelm writings."
2,We must have read different books?!,"I bought this book because of all the positive reviews here -- indeed, I think only one review gives the book less than 5 stars. Did we all read the same book? I was looking for a suspenseful, quick, and easy spring break beach read book, so I wasn't expecting too much. This book failed to meet even the most modest of expectations. The characters are incredibly undeveloped, the narrative is boring, repetitive (and then, and then, and then . . .), the plot is almost entirely absent in parts. This story could have been good, and the premise is really interesting. It seems like a rushed manuscript. Had the author slowed down, this book could have been much better exploration of the family dyamic. As it stands, it's so boring I almost couldn't finish . . ."
3,"Compelling, yet sad","I listened to this on audio tape and could not put it down. I was waiting for a happy part. A part to make the rest be okay and not so sad. There isn't any happy part. When I pictured Brian, all I could think was my 4 year old son and it made me cry. It was hard for me to just say ""this is a book and not real life"".I will not read one of her books again."
3,"Good Read, Not so good children.","I liked this book, not loved, liked. Its a good lesson to those who think that secrets should stay in families and letting them out will ruin you."
3,Family Friendly Raw,"Pros:* Delicious family friendly recipes* Lots of variety* I particularly enjoy making and serving the 'Sweets' e.g. Selenium Sweets and White Chocolate* Nice explanations of health benefits, when eating certain foodsCons:* Lots of recipes require dehydration, which is not quick and often not simple.* Ingredients that I wouldn't consider raw or particularly healthy e.g. nutritional yeast flakes, soya flour (not raw) and rice flour (not raw).* Quite a few recipes require sprouts, which are time-consuming to prepare.* Lots of dehydrating, which is also time-consuming."
2,There are better choices for raw food beginners,"I've owned and used this book for several months now. I am new to raw foodism in the last 6 months. I'm not new to cooking really great tasting dishes and am pretty skilled in the kitchen. Unfortunately, I have not been impressed with the outcome from any of the recipes I've tried from this book. They simply don't taste good. I have used two other raw food prep books and found lots of surprisingly tasty ways to eat things I'd previously eaten cooked or things I've never tried, but not in this book. My husband has asked me to stop using this one. The one thing I did like was an attempt to include the calorie/nutritional information for each recipe. That is uncommon and an eye-opener on how much fat and carbs plus lack of protein the dishes have. Also, the recipes aren't highly complicated like many of the raw prep books. I am enjoying Raw Food Made Easy for 1 or 2 People by Jennifer Cornbleet."
3,Another Swami Satyananda on the Far West,"Hari Om to all good Shaktas here, my slutations to you all! The surprise on bying a Book of Sri Swami Satyananda, which is not the Paramhamsa Swami Satyananda that we know was not a good news for me. But the SamSkrit translation and transliteration of anccient Dharma Shastras is of a good quality, not perfect, the translater is not a ripe saddhaka yet, but is blessed and blessing in bring into the light of the Far West the sweet and imspiring love for Shakti Devi! Mistakes of translation such as ""MA"" meaning ""limitation of Consciuousness"" is to be found is this work, ""MA"" realy means MANIFESTATION, as for Counsciousness has no limit at all... All though it is a nice Shakta text and a blessing to life and the heart of English language."
4,Eibach Sportlines,"I purchased a set of Eibach Sportlines for my 2006 Mkv GTI. They do give the car a significant drop. The ride is slightly more bumpy than stock. My quick tip if you do buy these, get them installed. What my seem like a quick and easy upgrade quickly turns into an hours long struggle. In the end, I'm very happy with my purchase and would readily buy them again."
5,excellent product,This book is an excellent bibliography for anyone working with ectoparasites and especially ixodides. It is a comprehensive book with essential information for project development and post graduate degrees in various fields of knowledge.The book is in excellent condition and can be considered a new book. The cover and pages have no imperfection or notes.I recommend everyone working in this field.
3,Joshi is mediocre,"Joshi himself admits that his work (1990) is not as complete as what he expected shortly in Douglas Greene's The Man Who Explained Miracles (1995), since Greene was Carr's authorized biographer. A Critical Study is still worthwhile in the manner in which Joshi tackles an analysis of each major character."
4,CD/DVD Labeling,"Labels are excellent in quality, but Matte White Full Face (8960) hard to use with stomper a they curl up on the stomper."
3,"Nice labels, hard to line up",Nice glossy labels. But can never get the imagage to line up on the lable using the software from the avery web site
1,The Product Quality Is Not The Problem,"I actually did not hate the product. It seems to be a good product: easy to use, sticks well, good print surface.I do not appreciate the fact that the manufacturer only included 18 labels while I was charged for 20.Either Avery cheats, thinking the customer will not notice, or their product quality control is lousy."
1,Design flaw,My problem is with the design of the luggage. When you attached it to the handle of another piece there is not enough room to get your hand between the new piece and the handle. My knuckles got really scrapped up from the lack of room and I have small hands. I had to return the luggage. I have never encountered such a problem with Hartmann and my family has had over a dozen pieces for years.I never would have thought this would be an issue.
2,"OK, if you're a hardcore fan","I have never seen a-ha live, but I have heard and read rather negative opinions on this stage show.And after watching this, it seems like most of those reviews were correct.For the hardcore fan, they'll love this up. But the singing is rather perfunctory and at times, lackluster. The performances here just don't have the punch of the group's studio recordings.Some groups sound just like their recordings when playing live, some sound GREAT and even better than their studio recordings, and still others sound WORSE than their albums.Unfortunately, a-ha sound worse. Stick to their studio output and you'll be fine."
2,VERY POOR sound quality...,"I have always been a big A-HA fan and have even been to a couple of their shows. This DVD however is poor, principally due to the very bad sound quality. I'm not sure what happened, but it seems to me that Morten cannot sing as he used to in the past. His voice is kind of weak in this show. I have been influenced by the several positive feed-backs I've read in Amazon, but now I regret. This is not a DVD that is worthwhile to have in your collection."
4,Good DVD,"It's a good DVD, however the sound quality as some people have suggested, is not the greatest. I have heard better quality sound on Peter Gabriel Concert DVD which was recorded way back in 1994. They should have done a better sound recording on this concert.. and I would love to hear it in DTS."
5,hypnotic fuzz at is best,"flying saucer attack's self titled(AKA rural psychedelia) release is a hypnotic gem. the theme of the album seems to be the exploration of new realms and soundscapes in music. the cd is consistently perfect throughout its entirety with the strong points being tracks like ""my dreaming hill"", ""wish"", and ""the drowners"". flying saucer attack had combined the dreaminess of my bloody valentine, eroticism of slowdive, and the space rock vibe of subarachnoid space to make a truly wonderful musical masterpiece."
4,Noisy atmospherics,"This is where they began, where FSA took off to ride the cosmic wind to some better place. The sound here is distant, other-worldly yet still tethered to Earth by some force of gravity that cohesively holds these songs together. While ""My Dreaming Hill,"" ""Make me Dream,"" ""Wish"" and ""The Drowners"" seem intent on taking the torch from My Bloody Valentine in terms of guitar effects, they are anchored by industrial-sounding beats. FSA also move forward from the MBV territory by including excursions into free-jazz on ""Moonset"" and pure ambient experimentation on ""Still."" This album is a great listen suited for galactic dreams while you have the headphones on."
2,Shoegaze noise yang to Slowdive's yin often falls under it's distorted weight,"2 1/2This fuzzed-out, psychedelic wave of distortion aesthetic does help to capture some amazing moments, though in this album's case I must argue that those moments do not outweigh the burden of living up to these production values throughout the entire disc. Often way to shrill, the feedback only lends itself to profound contrast when there is an effective and identifiable melody to contrast with, otherwise it often undermines the details found throughout the subtle sonic manipulations. Although the pure noisescapes can keep listeners afloat enough and even overwelm in their simplicity, it is clear that this act works best when both sides of the coin are played with equal measure and intensity, rather then the obsession to consume the listener by drowning them out with it's low-fi reverb."
2,"They ""say"" it's new......","I like the TV show but it's the people who sell it you can't trust. I didn't want to get a used dvd because you never no what the actual condition is. They say ""like new"" and it's beat all to pieces. So I decided to order one that was suposedly ""new"" from Amazon. Needless to say the fraze ""new"" was a lie. It was obviously scratched and I couldn't even see the end of one show to find out what happened. It couldn't have been new because it didn't come in its original shink wrap. It had been resealed at Amazon. You would have thought that a company like Amazon would have been true to it's word when they say it is new. I was disappointed by the product but who wants to go through the hassle of returning it 3-4 times? That's were they screw you and know they will get away with it."
2,For English speaking & spanish people only,Well it seems people from Quebec (part of the dvd region 1) will be unable to watch (or read the subtitles) in their native language. This is quite unfair!
5,STIRRING SECOND SEASON,"One of tv's best crime dramas, the SVU tackles its second season with the expected excellence it so marvelously used in its premiere season. The regulars--Christopher Meloni, Mariska Hargitay, Stephanie March, Richard Belzer, Dann Florek, B.D. Wong, Ice T and Michelle Hurd---continue to be among the best ensembles out there, and this season they get crackerjack guest performances from such stars as Eric Roberts as a neighborhood crime watcher; Richard Thomas as a crazed killer; Chad Lowe is brilliant as a rapist/killer; and Margot Kidder in a smallish role is outstanding as Lowe's sick mother.The characters continue to grow and the acting couldn't be better. A very good show!"
3,LAW & ORDER SVU SEASON 2,"When I recieved this purchase , it took a week to recieve it. The package look new but when I open it there were finger print on the buttom of the DVD before I even touch it. The DVD itself had no label print on it compare to a store purchase of season one and a purchase from another site from season 3. The DVD work fine but I have my doubt that it was an original."
5,My favorites,"Episodes were all different, and considering all are cops after the bad people, that's something. Never bored and there were no glitches in the DVDs. That's better than rentals, anytime."
1,kind of a rip-off,Not what you would expect from an artist of that magnitude. No interaction between artist and cheering crowd. Cold performance.
3,Not as expected.,I was very excited when I heard there was a Concert DVD out there and since I had seen him Live I was expecting to see the entire concert once again. As you can tell I was disappointed. I'm still a fan of Pepe and I love his music and enchanting voice nonetheless.
5,MUST Read for all Trying to Understand Incarceration,"""Although the focus of her information is to help those victims, her book is a must read for anyone who truly desires to understand the full meaning of incarceration.""- Eloy L. Mondragon, former New Mexico Secretary of Corrections"
5,Incredibly Helpful!,"""Practical, non-judgmental, and incredibly helpful...fills a huge void in the marketplace.""- Traci Cothran, Audio Book Club"
5,November 8th?,"K, its november 9th, a day after it said it would ship it. So, i felt like this was cool since thats when everyone else was going to get it anyway. WRONG!!! All it says is ""Item Is Being prepared to ship"". ? Wut ? Does that mean its coming tomorrow or thursday or mayb even friday?! I should have just preordered and done in store pickup somewhere else. Amazon is great for most things, but Halo 2 is the only thing i hav ordered from amazon that was not sent in the estimated ship date. Its cool tho, ill get it soon so im still happy."
5,Multiplayer Takes a Revolutionary Turn!,"While the single player in Halo 2 is lacking and does not really compare to that of the original, the game play is still action packed. The creators kept the same game elements and using the idea of ""if it ain't broke, leave it"", the game turned out all for the better. The multiplayer, however, makes up for the lack of single player. WIth all new maps as well as the Xbox Live service, the game is hard to beat. A matchmaking system has been introduced that has never been seen before. Also, a complex ranking system has been created so you can see how well your doing on H2's site, bungie.net. The special edition box has a dvd with tons of info. However, if you are not an avid halo fan or interested in the making of the game, you should not waste your money on the special edition and just go for the original game. Also, the multiplayer experience is really only complete with Xbox Live service which is sold seperately!"
3,Halo,G. Jagiello! It wasn't Amazons fault that you didn't get your little Halo 2 yet! Maybe your so obssesed with Halo that you forgot to come back to reality! When you where ordering Halo did you check what it said for availability? Can you read?..No! It said that Amazon will get the game on Nov. 9 NOT you will get this game on Nov. 9! In other words Amazon will ship the game to your home on Nov. 9! It may take a few days to reach your home! Next time learn how to read before ordering something!
1,Expecting a lot more,This game is basically the same as the first on except they added a few more guns and now you can dual wield. Its really boring how its just the same relentless killing over and over again. What is the point? The story line was practically the same. Another ring you have to blow up because it will wipe out the entire inverse. The flood makes their apperence once again.I wasnt too impressed with this game you should just rent it.
2,"Single person alright, Multiplayer lame","Halo 2 is an alright game, nothing really new and original about it:Single player:I've been through the first two levels and it's pretty much just a future battle scene in urban combat, nothing that hasn't been done before. Plus the AI isn't the smartest, original half-life has better AI still.Multiplayer: I HATE it! It takes forever to get a game going, you can't choose to enter a certain game you have to wait for the server to place you in a random game. This results in almost never being in a type of game that you want to be in. You can't set up you're own game unless you invite your friends to play. The multiplayer levels themselves are also unoriginal and have been done before.Halo 2 isn't worth it, I'm going to just going to return it for Half life 2."
2,Wow messed up stuff...,I preordered the game over a month ago and despite the promised shipping date at the release of the game I was scheduled to get the game 10 days later...the one day shipping *cough*(what a joke). I was alittle irrate over this and just out of experimentation I tried ordering another copy today. It is scheduled to get here tomorrow (umm...ok). Suprised to say the least I tried canceling my previous order to no avail....guess I will be receiving 2 copies. Assuming they WILL let me return the one copy I suggest this could be a suitable course of action for those also in my predicament. Overall I am very disappointed with amazon's service and do not plan to preorder from them again.
5,Short yet pleasing!,"This game is easilly the best game I have ever played. The story is pretty good, and so is the sound, graphics and aliens. The Brutes are big and powerful. The Grunts are still fun to kill, the shield guys (can't remember their name) have an awesome sniper rifle. This is in my favourite game list with Halo, Half-life and Max Payne. Its very short but you should enjoy it. O yea, the music is incredible."
4,great fun not the best,"great game not all the hype 10,000,000 sold on the old game 35,million sold on first day tplay halo before 2 please play almost the same game"
2,Halo Boom or Bust ? (Bust),"This game sucked, if you have something that works why fix it. Ok make the graphics better, make the environment more destructible but don't do what Bungie did. They made all the fans hate the ending; hate the changes to the human weapons, although the some of the covenant weapons are ok. I predict Bungie will make a lot of money from Halo 2 but no where as much as they would have if they had some, or more input on the beta versions of the game from the everyday gamer."
5,Great,Well my shipment arrived 3 days after I purchased it the disc was in great condition and ya this guy is awesome
5,Wow,"I knew this game was going to be good, but I never imagined it would be as good as it is. The original Halo was good but it lost me after a few levels. This one is different. I'm doing about 5 levels a day. If you're a shoot-em' freak and you're thinking if you should buy this game I say you should definetly get it."
3,Not worth the limited edition,"Maybe you'll disagree, I rather save the extra 10 bucks and get a regular than a limited edition... they only give you an aluminum case with behind the scenes cd which i could be less interested in."
5,Another great game,"What to say more then everyone already knows, that Halo games are the top games to play. This is one of them and it works on xbox 360S."
5,Cool,Product arrived as described and plays on console great. Collector's edition case and inserts in great condition for age. My son loves this game.
3,Halo 2 huh.,"So I am convinced that this Halo 2 that everyone is talking about is a completely different Halo 2 than the one that I bought. I had bought it because I'm a huge Halo fan and to be honest have every one. In my opinion though Halo 2 is the worst out of the franchise besides wars. 1 through 3, 3 would be the best. Hell even the director of Bungie hated and gave Halo 2 a bad review. To put it simple the game is boring. You want a Halo game buy Reach or Halo 4"
4,no XBOX Live life before Halo 2!! Long live Bungie!,"The first time I bought this game I traded it in coz it was so unlike my idiolized GR2-all the rays, plasmas, aliens-intolerable. Alas, I was shamefully wrong;i bought it again.The campaign is 4 star good; the story line makes sense especially after visiting the addicts at halopedia.org. The cinematics help too. I have finished the game once on campaign mode will start over a level harder.Halo 2 will awaken you when you continuously get killed by 10 year olds on XBOX Live. The 5.1 sound is flawless-5 stars! If you like FPS and have XBL, then you have to try this.Halo 2 lives on XBL"
2,Quality rating was not what they said.,When the item arrived it was all dented up. They rated pretty well. But I would not have. I dont think I can resell this item b/c it is all banged up. Supposed to be a tin box and it is but in very rough shape. I wouldnt have bought it if I had known.
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"This is a frustrating game to review, because it has some great features. However, as everyone who has played this game for more than 8 hours quickly realized, it's a rip-off. This game is about one-third as long as the first Halo, and doesn't really add many features that weren't available in the original. There is no excuse for hyping a game this much, while the average player can defeat it in less than ten hours. If you don't have Live!, this game is a rental, at best."
1,Halo 2 Limited Edition,All I got was the DVD disc instead of the game disc. So what if it was stated in the description that the package does not contain the game disc. It should be listed and sold under the DVD disc category instead of games. I search under games and this thing was the first one that was listed. Who reads every fine print anyway?
2,"Good, but there is better","First of all I must say I dont own halo 2, infact i dont even own a xbox (i have better things to do with $150). However I did play this at my friends house who owns it and the xbox. First of all we played the copertive story mode, it sucked. We got bored after 10 min. and then we played his little brother's v-smile (yeah that thing on the annoying commerical). That was more fun than this game. A little later I got bored and I decided to give halo another try, so i hit the single player story mode. It was fun for about 10 minutes, but then I got bored again. The levels all seem kindof the same, with the same plot for each -- kill everything that moves, then find your way through a maze of hallways and doors. On the positive side, the graphics are amazing (for a console anyway), and the AI is decent for once. If you have a good computer, check out half life or doom 3, they kick the heck out of this game. And if you have a ps2, get gta san andreas, now thats a good game."
2,Its kinda good,"First of all HALO 1 is much better overall. I got bored after a few hours of playing though. REplay value is not good. On the other hand, the graphics are really good. Online SUCKS wang though. If you want an amazing online game, get SOCOM II: US Navy Seals. Its okay for a rental though. Its an average FPS with nothing really special. Although i admit it is fun for the first while you play it. Overall: 4/10 Replay: 3/10 Graphics: 7/10 Sound 4/10"
1,Preorder,Yeah I preordered Halo 2 in August with the promise that it would be at my door step November 9th. Well its Nov. 9th and it hasnt even shipped yet. Amazon.com pre order is not the way or the place to buy video games!
5,Still Waiting,"I preordered this game planning on getting it as early as possible. Unfortunately, this is not the case. I wish that I had just gone to gamestop and preordered it there.UPDATE: I got the game in the mail Nov. 11. I did want to get the game on opening day, but I got it 2 days later. If you really want to preorder a game, go to gamestop or some other store where you can walk in and pick it up yourself. Don't use amazon to preorder unless it's a long time before it comes out. Otherwise, amazon is great."
5,Don't buy this version unless you want the case,"That bonus disc of making of featurettes that comes with this version of Halo 2 is not very enlightening or very cool. It is not worth the extra $5. However, the cool silver case may be worth the extra $5 to some people, and if you're one of those people, then sweet! You got the cool case!The silver case is fun, but the game is already awesome as awesome gets. I just thought the bonus DVD was lame."
1,didn't get the game,"I didn't receive the game when I purchased this, all i received was the bonus disc dvd. I've very upset about this actually. I purchased this to replace my version that disappeared, so then I could have my collection of Halo complete again. Now I'm still without the game! how do you advertise Halo 2 game then after I give you money for the game, I don't get it!?"
4,"Awesome... must own if you have an xbox, just skip the ""collectors edition""","No need to buy the collectors edition - it's just the companys' way of making a few more bux off each sale. The extra DVD that came with it... I have no clue what's on it because I've never taken it out of the box. Once I started playing the game, I could have cared less what was on that extra disc.Just buy the regular version. The game... AMAZING."
2,Wow Bungie you really [...] up this time..,I will tell you what happens at the end of this game.... Master Chief what are you doing on the covenant boarding ship? Finishing this fight were the three words said at the end of the game. I waited 2 years for this!? I hope bungie never makes another game again because byfar this 1 SUCKED
4,Good Sequel,"Halo 2 is nothing short of being impressive. It has a fair single player campaign and a fun online mode. If you have a lot of friends that have Xbox Live then you'll probobly want to pick this one up since it's the most popular Live game. If you plan on playing single player only then you might want to rent this one first. Graphicly, the game is good, however the textures are a bit weak. At the end of the day, it's hard to go wrong with Halo 2 if you have Xbox Live, if not, you may want to consider buying it."
4,DADDY'S IMPRESSED,My now-13-year-old son eagerly awaited the sequel to Halo. I too secretly anticipated it's availability as I have played many times with my son and have come to enjoy the game. Halo 2 was as good as Halo with some minor exceptions.PRO:- Great story line. The cut scenes and follow-on action blend well.- Longer opportunities to drive Marine tank.- New flight controls for Banshie.- Ability to drive Alien Tank.- Ability to hijack vehicles.CON:- Banshie inability to go 'backwards'- No link play!- Too dark in many places. For my degrading eyes anyways.
3,I'm also still waiting,"I'm also still waiting. Pre-order a week ago and said it will ship it out to me on November 9. NOVEMBER 9!!!!! I can get it somewhere else on November 9... not November 12.By the way to the kid you asked way Halo 2 is rated ""M"". It's rated ""M"" for violence, blood and gore and language."
3,more of the same,"halo 1 is one of the most amazing games, along with metroid prime 1 (and 2). halo 2 however is just an over polished, softened version of the first game. i'm really dissappointed, the thing is they had nearly everything so tight in the first game but went and screwed with it. you don't feel that bang!! that gritty feeling it almost feels as though you have mittens and a dress on while playing. i'm really pleased to see that nintendo always focuses on innovation and has realised that hype and graphics do not make a game great. i don't know how much work bungie did but after three years, i expected a much better game, honestly one can only care about the storyline so much , but this is a game not a movie-if by chance you get a look at the extended dvd you will see that bungie admmitted all their mistakes(while eating pizza) and do not even realise it. i hope halo3 is better but i have my eyes on metroid prime 3 for now.."
3,Disappointed,"Too short, too dark and dreary, too boring due to repetitive gameplay (and, what's with unloading 2 or 3 clips just to kill a baddie??? even when I'm shooting them in the head!?! then spend all your time looking for ammo, geez). I actually liked the cut scenes/story better than the play. The levels I liked the best were too short (on Earth, outside) and the others were a pain to get through due to unattractive/UGLY settings that ran for miles and miles and miles. And the Flood are just plain annoying. I want more realistic play with a greater variety of environments. It's that simple. Plus, I'd like immature idiots not to play on Xbox live."
1,Game didn't come with it!!!,"I got the game for a friend so when I got the product I didn't even look at it. The day after I gave it to her, she said that it was only one of the DVD's and not the game and missing the second DVD. TERRABLE PRODUCT. The description said that it came with everything, but it didn't. I spend over $40 on it too."
4,Amazon Blew It . . . Or maybe not?,I sure wish I had this game. I preordered it at the end of September. Same problem as others have noted. My advice. NEVER preorder anything from Amazon. They really blew this one.Update: I just got the game in the mail. Even though my account does not indicate that the game has even been shipped to me yet it still arrived!!!
1,Limited Collection Edition Halo2,"So damaged it did not work Tried to inform seller, got no response. Andrew W. Kragt, from Maple Valley, Wa.There is his label address on package, should I just return it?I been sick so I have not given it much attention until I got your post.My grandson is VERY unhappy bcause it did not work. His Christmas money paid for it.Ethan & Grandma Sandra"
1,this is the worst toy,This is the worst video game ever. Why would anyone in the right mind purchuse this item. its like like purchusing foul talking and bloody action in your home. I as a mother will not buy this. but my 15year old son did. and it changed our house it is so evil.
5,Listen Up!,"Alright, i've been hearing some people say they are pissed that the game hasn't come yet because it's ""shipped"" already. You guys need to listen up right now: When Amazon.com says ""your purchase is being shipped"", then that doesn't mean it has shipped to YOU, it means it has shipped to your local UPS or FED EX. Goodness, people, don't cry about it.Otherwise, I went to my friend's house because i was still waiting for the game to come, and it is the best game i have ever played. the sound, gameplay, lighting, graphics: everything. it is the best."
1,Also still waiting!!!!,"I am also still waiting for this game. I ordered this item 2 months ago. I'm hoping that tomorrow will be the day, but I have already written to Amazon. What is the deal? Usually Amazon is really good about sending my orders promptly. I can't give this game a rating becuase I haven't played it yet."
1,Never pre-order on Amazon,"Figure this one out. I ordered a copy for myself early in October.I then about 5 days ago ordered a copy to be sent to my brother. Now it says that my brothers copy (ordered later) is shipped, my copy is still to be shipped soon. And even though the local Meijerhas the game in stock, Amazon won't let me cancel my still to be shipped order. Refrickindiculous."
1,I'll never pre-order anything from Amazon again!,"Well, it's now November 10th and my son's copy of Halo 2 still hasn't shipped.....according to Amazon it had an ETA of November 8th. We preordered back in August. Will continue to look locally for it and return the shipment to Amazon......that is if it ever arrives!!!!! They've just lost me as a customer."
5,GO WITH BEST BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I ordered from amazon months ago, and it didn't ship. I ordered on line from my local best buy yesterday(November 9th) at 3pm and picked it up at 6 on my way home from work. My Neighbor got it from best buy and had it over nighted, they shipped on the 8th, it arrived on the sale date November 9th. Much Better than Amazon.The game is pretty much more off the same - but the original was so good they can get away with it. The vehichles and weapons are cool, and the controlls and displays are improved. All in all worth $50 if you loved halo"
5,THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!,"Halo 2 is the most incredible gaming experience you can imagine. Breaking it down:Graphics - Fantastic! Fluid, colorful, interestingStory - Simply mind blowing! The plot in Halo 2 is so completely riveting it rivals ANY popular science fiction or fantasy movie plot! Yes, I'm talking as entrancing as Star Wars or Lord of the Rings!Playability - Plenty of improvements including new weapons, access to Covenant weapons and vehicles, and shooting two-handed. PLUS... a fascinating playing twist early in the game, which I won't reveal..Every owner of XBox should buy this game. Every owner of an alternative system should buy XBox so they can buy this game! This gets my highest recommendation possible."
5,The best game ever and more,The best game ever has just got better. The limited collector's edition has the same halo 2 game in a collectable tin case plus a bonus DVD containing the making of halo 2 deleted scenes and characters Halo 1 and Halo 2 cutscenes and more. It may not make a difference to some people but it is generally up to you whether you want to pay the extra five bucks to get the limited edition. Copies of these are strictly limited and are likely to be sold out after christmas. So you can get it before christmas and you can get one of the last ones at your local game store. Good luck
4,"Excellent game, but clearly rushed","Halo 2 is the most fun I've had on a console game since--well, Halo 1. The gameplay is excellent and the game is far more balanced, without any abundant megaweapons like the pistol in the original Halo. The game is far glitchier however, and this can detract from the experience, especially with how easy it is to cheat."
3,More of the same,Few changes from Halo. If you did like Halo I would recommend getting the sequel of course.
3,I am a 15 year old Halo addict but find halo 2 a bit lacking,"Like many I was super hyped for the Nov. 9th release of what was to be the best xbox game of all time. I went to my local bestbuy and preordered the special edition copy of the game, making sure I would get it on Nov 9th. Then came the day I'd been waiting for, and I went to get the game and quickly ran over to my friends house(my box was broken) to play some 2 player deathmatch at coagulation(new blood gulch). After playing for 5 mins and seeing everything new, I noticed I was not having too much fun and felt there was a lot missing. It cold be the lack of a decent pistol or some new weapon imbalences, but it didn't feel right. It is not a ad game by any means, but I suggest a rental before purchase. Don't make a decision you might regret like I did."
4,Ham!,"I used the recipe in this book to make my first ham. It was a great success and everyone enjoyed the apple and onion salad that the recipe recommended serving with the ham. It's been a fun book, but I think it will be most useful in the summer when more vegetables are in season."
3,ok but far from the best,i have no issues with the shipper in terms of shipping time etc.the gun works also but the one i got does not completely shut off water flow when the trigger is released......very disappointed.anyway in all fairness to the seller i cannot blame them for this problem as they are not the manufacturers and this might not be the case for all of the guns.......im probably just unlucky.WOULD'NT MIND A REPLACEMENT THOUGH.........smile!!
3,Picture Memory Card - Fuji 256MB xD,"Good price for card. I am disappointed that this did not come new in original packaging, as I believed it would. I did not see anything in item profile stating that it wouldn't.It was shipped in a SanDisk plastic case inside of a Uline static shield bag. This made me wonder if this was previously used."
3,A little overpriced......,"Purchased gun to install 1/2"" solid bamboo flooring was recommended by a lateral flooring manufacturer. It performed ok but jammed a few times and I had to shim angled foot to improve performance. I felt tool was a bit overpriced for a basic narrow crown stapler which can be purchased at any home improvement store for less tan $100. That makes the foot retrofit a very expensive accessory, but with limited sales potential the high price the manufacturer probably justifies the price...."
4,My favourite non-LM CD...,"Haunting music arranged around harp melodies. Hollienea's voice is quite beautiful, and hits high gear on track 1. Loreena McKennitt comparisons inevitable but unfair. One of the few CD's I have bought in the last couple years not being used for a coaster. Stayed in car CD player for 1 month straight."
5,The music of the Jewish soul,"Shlomo's music is everywhere today in the Jewish world. Shuls which would not let him in during his lifetime davvan today to his nigunim.He wrote some of the most beautiful songs we have.My own holy teacher Dovid Hertzberg sang these songs all the time, and they were for a constant inspiration."
4,The Persecuted Church -- all too real,"Jeff's view of Christianity's role in a ""tolerant"" society can easily be envisioned in this day and age. Many of the scenes in the book can be found in countries around the world -- the Bible banned, Christians persecuted for sharing their faith. It is a chilling but compelling story of globalized persecution."
3,The Doorway Papers,"This is by far the most insightful and innovative look into various aspects of Christianity. It is a combination of C.S. Lewis and Francis Schaeffer but surprisingly full of innovative thinking of which I have never read. I would easily say that these papers (all 60) are must reading for any Christian after the bible. Combining immaculate scholarship, exhaustively researched scientific corroboration, within the framework of a highly biblical environment, it is simply astounding reading of the likes which will transform your thinking."
5,Great aromatherapy!,My daughter loves this product. I had to take it away from her so that we would have it when she needed it with a migraine. She finds the aroma very soothing.
3,It's OK,"It really doesn't do all that much for me, but then after 10 years the doctors can't do anything for me either...... I guess it makes me relax a little. I don't necessarily like the roller all that much - - it's large, which is good, but it doesn't feed well & it makes me think of a deodorant...."
1,Ehhh,"Bought this to re[lace HeadOn which is not being made anymore. This product stinks, both literally and figuratively. Company I bought it from only sent one bottle when I had ordered two . When I wrote them about it they did send second bottle ASAP. The product will not be reordered. Smells horrible and makes headache worse..."
2,"Does not work like 'Head On', unfortunately.","Was hoping to find a substitute for head-on. It does provide a cooling sensation, but does not relieve the pain."
2,Uses too much water,"This is actually 2 showerheads in one. It allows you to use one or the other, or both. Problem is, using either of them alone does not provide good coverage so I found everybody in the house using both. When using both you are using twice as much water as with a normal showerhead. Not very economical, plus it cut the amount of hot water down....so there were some cold showers! Never had a problem with hot water with 45 gal water heater before this showerhead. I've since replaced it and tossed this one."
3,peerless shower system,"I was excited to receive this shower device due to the previous raving reviews. I, however, am not thrilled with it. It does provide good water flow and has a nice variety of shower settings, but the device itself is larger than I thought it would be, and hangs down too low. For a tall person the shower stream would probably hit you at your chest, rather than on your head. When I try to adjust the position of the shower head, it doesn't stay in place. It's also made of cheap-feeling plastic, so I'm not sure how long it will last. It's just OK, and I'm keeping mine, but I wouldn't buy it again."
3,"Currently works well, but . . . .","I purchased this shower system to replace one that was about ten years old. Before I installed it I made sure that everything was tightened up per all the other reviews about leaking. It was simple to install and both my wife and I like it's performance very well. I like to have both shower heads on and she likes just the main one on, so we are both satisfied. The reason that I only gave it three stars is: the hose on it is noticeably shorter than on the one it replaced and I really need a longer hose to rinse all of the water jets when cleaning the tub and it seems made of very cheap lightweight plastic that I doubt will last anywhere near the 10 years that the previous one did."
3,Wish it was sturdier.,"The last showerhead i got was from Costco and it was amazing. I thought this one would compare but it really does not. I have to keep constantly adjusting The top part of it so the water does not leak out. And the water pressure is mediocre. The only good thing about this product is that it has three different settings, So my little one can enjoy the shower without the pressure being too hard on her. Although I do wish Costco still sold the old shower head that I had."
2,"Peerless 76950 2-in-1 Shower System, Chrome",lasted close to 2 years and broke from the swivel joint. Not a big problem because it comes with lifetime warranty.
4,"Shower Twice, Once","The best thing is that when you use this, there is a lever on the side that lets water come out of just one or both so if you want the detachable shower head for say washing a young one in the tub then you can switch off the main shower head so you don't get wet too. Sturdy, Durable, and looks expensive. Easy to install on your own also. Just get some Teflon tape for the threads to ensure no leaks."
4,Great multipurpose shower system.,There's a bunch of settings. I would buy this again for my next place. It's easy to install and easy to use.
3,Leaks,We used this shower head for over a year it started leaking around the out stationary part. Certainly not the best hand held shower we have had but not the worse either. Average.
2,The Water Pressure,"I purchased this shower-head for one reason and one reason only-water pressure. After two knee surgeries, the Doctor said to message the knee to diminish the scar tissue and pain. It sounded like a job for a good shower-massage. Now, keep in mind that the benchmark for this review is from a shower head purchased in Target, so I am comparing one shower massage to another and here are my findings. This Peerless shower system did a lot better than the store-bought shower-head. It does increase water pressure and surpassed my old one by about 25%. I travel a lot and I have been in more than 100 hotels so I can say you won't be pounded by water but it did improve water pressure.Aesthetics- I paid the same price for both. The one from Target is white and looks cheap. The Peerless looks really nice.Update: Did not stand the test of a short time. The shower head stopped pulsing."
5,I love it!,"I really like this shower head. I haven't had any complaints, and except for a small leak in the selector knob (which has sealed itself apparently) I've had no troubles.If you like the idea of a dual-head shower and can't redo your bathroom, this is the best I've tried."
3,Excellent...,"Good news for fetishists, this shower head is excellent for someone who wants to feel like they are getting peed on. 3 *s!"
3,OK....for now,"When I removed this shower head from it's shipping container it felt very light in weight.Installation was straight forward, easy, no leaks.Because it feels rather ""unsubstantial"" I gotta wait before posting more."
1,piece of junk,"piece of junk. you get what you pay for, i guess. I wanted to use it to wash my dogs, but you can't turn off the top part to use the hand held device....as far as i can tell."
1,Junk!!!!!!,I put in in two months ago. The big head broke off this morning. Worst piece of JUNK I've had for a shower head. To bad there is not a NO STAR RATING. That is what is deserves.
2,Hose TOO Short,"I've had this shower head for a year now, and I'm looking to replace it. First of all, when you remove it to use as hand-held, it doesn't come off easily -- feels like you're going to take the entire shower head off. Secondly, the hose is way TOO short. You have to hold it up in the air to reach the back of the tub. It's too short to kneel down outside the tub and take it down to wash your hair. And, last, the plastic lever you need to twist to change the spray is stiff and confusing, never quite sure which way to turn it to get which section to spray. Now whom do I dislike enough to give this to?"
2,Very cheap and lightweight,"I was not impressed. The entire unit (including the hose) must weigh less than 1lb. Everything is plastic. Tightening the connections must be done with great care in order to avoid cracking the plastic. If you do need to use pliers to tighten the connections you will have great difficulty doing this without marking the plastic - a strap wrench might work.Mine came missing a washer and so trips to 2 stores were needed to find the correct one. $2.08 for 2 (coz they come in packs of 2) washers plus gas and about an hour in time. If it weren't for that, the install would have taken 5 minutes.The spray is OK but not as good as my Speakman Anystream 2000.I would not recommend this unit to a friend."
5,One of the best $30 I've ever spent,"I just used this for the first time, and it is simply amazing. I have a hard time believing it only uses the 2.5 gpm it says on the package!I have used a number of handheld showers over the years--always had a dog, and it makes it MUCH easier to wash them. Waterpik, Delta, even other Peerless models. This model is SO much better than any of the ones I've used.Very easy installation--I didn't need any tools, hand tightening was enough for me.People that are taller than me may want to consider getting one of the height adding things available from Home Depot (or the like), as it was just high enough for me at 5'7"".Buy it! You won't regret it. Seriously."
4,peerless shower system,"So far, so good. Installed a couple of days ago to replace a standard showerhead (the Delta water amplification one, which is still a really great showerhead). The main reason for this one was to have a handheld shower in order to give our dog a bath without too much chaos. I added a stretchable stainless steel hose to give some additional reach and everything is working great. When both the showerhead and handheld are running, it's quite a lot of water - great for rinsing your hair or continuing to use the handheld while still getting a shower from above. The one drawback is that this amount of water also uses up our hot water tank's capacity rather quickly, which I can't say for the Delta water amplification head. Overall, great product so far and does what's promised."
4,Shower for Two,"NOTE: If you're tall, be sure to get theS Shower Armas well, because it hangs a bit low. It's still a great value and just as easy to install. I'm 6'4"" and have no issues using both items together.My favorite thing about this showerhead is that two people can shower without either one freezing. Usually one person is left out of the water and gets cold, but when you have water coming from the handheld and the head itself, both people can be warm whether they're the latherer or the latheree.The showerhead is a little hard to tighten to the point of being completely leak-free (I get a couple drips), and the black rubber washers that prevent leaking are loose and easily lost when taking it out of the package so be careful.Overall it's a great showerhead, and the pleasantness it brings my daily life is worth for more than what I paid."
5,A++++++,I have nothing but good things to say! It took me a whole five minutes to install and I would buy one again in a second. It puts my old shower head to shame! I will have to agree with other reviewers that the hose could be a little longer. I did buy it for the hose since my 5 yr old is afraid to take a regular shower and I am planning to use it to hose her down instead of a bath all the time. Still not complaining though. I could of stayed in the shower all day!!
5,What a luxurious little thing!,"Was this really only 30 dollars? How on earth did I get such a spectacular showerhead for so cheap? The water pressure is great, being able to have a hot shower while I do the ""detailing""? Amazing. The removable portion could afford to have a few more settings, but I am ridiculously pleased despite that. I'm a bath person and this showerhead makes me resent less those mornings when I have no time for a long luxurious bath."
2,not enough water,I removed two O-rings from inside this shower assembly but still the water flow is inadequate. Otherwise I like it. It was easy to install and the hand-held portion is easy to take out and replace. But it needs more water flow. My old shower had much better flow.IS there another flow reducer apart from the rubber rings?
5,Love it!,Love my new Peerless handheld shower head from the first day I used it. The water that is coming out is perfect. I will get another one for my 2nd bath
5,EXACTLY what I wanted!,"Could not be happier. I just moved into a new apartment and the shower just didn't have as strong of pressure as my old one and I was so bummed. Got this yesterday (one day before it was scheduled to arrive). Works just like it says/what the video review shows. Took all of 5 minutes to install, and has AWESOME water pressure. The hardest pressure comes out of the handheld when only that is on and at the middle spray setting. Took me 10 minutes LESS to take a shower this morning!! AWESOME!"
5,Really Nice,Great shower head! The dual heads give a really wide stream of water and has a prefect water flow. The length of the hand held is perfect for bathing the dogs (or kids I would imagine). I would buy this again!
4,great product for the price,What more can I say but it's a great product for the price. LOVE IT. has nice pressure and I love the rain shower feeling of it. I wanted to buy a rain shower head for awhile. Glad I didn't buy an expensive one because this one can't be beat for the price. I saw almost exact same one at lowe's for [...]
5,Awesome showerhead!,"I just received this the other day. Installed using teflon tape on all threads and have zero leaks. Took about 15 minutes to install including a new shower arm. I highly recommend getting the S shaped shower arm with this (it's likely listed on the product page also) raises it 6"" higher and that makes a huge wonderful difference.It feels like standing in the rain. I'm gonna have to wake up earlier as my showers are definitely going to take longer now!"
1,Broke after 10 months of use,"I did love this shower head while it worked. It provided excellent water pressure and coverage. However, after just 10 months of use the piece that holds the shower head in place broke, causing the shower wand to just hand lifelessly in our shower. Not a pleasant shower experience! I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Poor quality,"First off I'd like to say that this showerhead is not for tall people. I am over 6 ft tall and cannot stand underneath it. This was ok because you can tilt the head up, so at least the water comes down over most of your head and body, if not directly over your head. But after only a few months, the showerhead would not stay up, leaving the larger showerhead virtually useless, unless I wanted to crouch under it. Not a good way to take a comfortable shower!Like quite a few other people have noted on here, I've also had trouble with it leaking. After less than a year, I'm finding myself having to replace this showerhead. It's not a good quality showerhead at all. Just money down the drain."
1,new products shouldn't require this much work to fix leaks,"I see another reviewer has fixed his leak. When mine leaked, I contacted Alsons at the number on the package. After a couple of tries, I did get a pleasant and helpful rep who advised me about tightening the little internal nut with a hex driver, which I don't have, so she said she'd send a replacement out with the nut already tightened (""pre-tested here""). Replacement part arrived promptly, unit still shooting water out the top, this customer done. Item returned for refund.All plastic parts, easily lost washers (almost thrown out with hard-plastic clamshell packaging), not a quality product. If you want a fancy showerhead, spend more money for quality."
1,Fell apart immediately,"The handheld part barely glues onto the hose, and fell apart within 2 minutes of installing. The whole thing feels light and cheap. I actually loved the idea of the 2 in 1, but calling it chrome is a huge misrepresentation because it is actually plastic spray painted. My attempt to reconnect the hose with plumbers epoxy stuff and two friends did not work and made a huge mess."
1,This may be the worst product I have ever purchased on Amazon,"This faucet has a mode that allows you to flow water through the hand wand and the horseshoe shaped shower head at the same time. Unfortunately, the flow is so restricted you barely get any water through the shower head, save for a trickle. When moving the selector dial on the wand for the first time, the nozzle piece popped off, for the first, but certainly not, the last time. After just a few days the swivel socket, that attaches to the shower head, decided to eject itself from the stem. It was probably ashamed of how terribly made it was and wanted to end it's miserable existence. The hose is made of terribly stiff plastic that helps to knock over anything in the vicinity of the shower. Also, it has a very strong plasticky smell that lingered for several days, until I finally removed it from the bathroom. This is a incredibly cheap knock off and certainly not worth your money, move on, I beg you."
2,Massaging Featured Stopped Working After A Week,"This shower head is pretty good, structure is high quality. However I bought 2 of these and they BOTH stopped massaging after a week of use."
3,Spa Shower Head,"Remember the old adage ""you get what you pay for"" when purchasing this item. It's not a bad buy, considering the low cost. But, it is plastic and the hose is an opaque rubber, not stainless or chrome. The shower head works well and the handheld snaps firmly back in place. I highly recommend using plumber's tape or dope, when installing the shower head. Otherwise, it has a tendency to leak."
4,great so far,"streams of water came out evenly strong, leaked at first but it was because i did not screwed the ends on correctly, my husband fixed that now working great"
2,Both Poor package and leak control,"While fast and safe delivery the package sliced my finger as it took an incredible amount of strength to get out of the sealed package. Also, for anyone who like me could not stop the leak by following the directions plus plumbers tape which has always worked on every of the hundreds of fitting I have fixed over the years. I then used plumbers putty as well and now no leaks, otherwise I would have sent it back."
3,Restrictor removal? How? I can't find it,"I bought this after spending hours reading about shower heads, and which brands and models allowed the removal of the restrictor. According to the reviews here, there should be a green restrictor that is easily removed. Well, I bought the same model from Walmart for $35, and there was no removable restrictor. I know that Walmart gets ""special"" versions of some products in order to lower their costs, and I'm now wondering if that's what I got. One thing I noticed, was that the valve to control flow from the outside ring to the inside handheld is painted chrome in the pictures here. Mine is just gray. I'm going to have to return it, and go with my original plan to buy a $50 Grohe showerhead from Lowes. According to the internets, Grohe has easily removable restrictors."
5,Great shower head,"I don't know why I suffered for so long in a mediocre shower. I researched shower heads here on Amazon and thanks to the reviews, I chose this one. It lives up to it's reputation. It was simple to install. The improvement from my previous shower head is tenfold. It's like I have a spa shower in my bathroom."
2,Mixed Feelings,"I bought this unit based on the outstanding reviews so perhaps my expectations were too high. Let's start with the positives - I like the double shower head and the different spray settings. On the negative side, the shower head is ugly and it leaks shortly after I turn it off and, at least once a day at odd times. I am not sure if this is actually a problem with the shower head or with my faucet. However, my old shower head did not leak."
3,"Handheld part falls out, leaking 2 years later","It's nice looking and the water flow is good, but two years later we have to replace it because the shower head itself is leaking and sprays water in all directions. Also, the hand held part will just slip out sometimes while you're in the shower and can hit you in the head if you're in the way. Not a terrible shower head, though."
1,Didn't work for me,"I had high hopes, but this showerhead simply did NOT work. I couldn't get it to stop leaking. So I figured that was due to my inexperience. So I hired a plumber to come out and install it properly. After working with it for almost an hour (with the $$$ clock running) and using all of his plumbing 'tricks', the plumber said that he also could not stop it from leaking, that it was defective. He told me to return it and get something else. That's exactly what i did!"
2,Significantly changes the water output point of your shower,"This showerhead extends your shower arm by many inches downward which can cause problems with the water flow output point. In my shower, it caused the water to be coming out too low. (My shower arm rough-in is 76"" high and I'm 5'9"".) So I went and bought an S-shaped shower arm replacement to elevate the shower head by about 8 inches. Now the water comes out high enough but shoots out too far meaning I have to stand farther away than I'd like. This would be fine if the showerhead could angle so it points more downward but the ball-and-socket joint prevents it from doing so. Depending on your personal shower preferences and layout, these issues might not be a problem, but for me, I'm in the market for a new showerhead."
1,Leaking,"Like some others, I had a leaking problem on install. It doesn't seem to be a great design, the parts don't seem to quite line up correctly. After playing with it for a while I did manage to get it to work with only a very minimal leak, but after reading some other reviews here I might go back and try some of their ideas. I definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone though, a shower-head should be a very easy thing to install without any problems like this one seems to have. I'm no expert but I've installed shower heads, faucets, toilets, kitchen sinks and a few other things around the house, this one should have been a 5 minute job."
5,PERFECT SHOWERHEAD!,"This showerhead is amazing, especially for the price. My boyfriend and I were always frustrated taking a shower together because only one of us had water at a time. This showerhead solved this. It's super easy to install. I highly recommend it!"
2,Peerless 2 in 1 shower head.,"I purchased this shower head and I have been disappointed. The shower head and all other equipment are made out of plastic or plastic that has the appearance of chrome. Even with nylon plumbers tape and following the instructions installing it, the thing has always leaked. Its hose wasn't long enough for giving my dogs a bath and trying to spray their undersides. I would keep looking for something like a delta brand made from actual metal and has a hose that is longer and made from metal ."
2,Hose is too short,"Despite the fact that the shower system is quite good with 2 choices of water spray/flow, I was very disappointed that the hose was too short to my liking as my previous hoses to other shower heads were always satisfactorily longer which is much more convenient for reaching corners of the shower when cleaning the shower out. Also a longer hose is much more helpful and convenient when washing the dog as dog does not stand still and with this short hose it is very difficult to reach the dog as he sometimes goes and stands in the furthest corner of the shower as this dog is not keen on getting a bath and shower hose does not even reach to the floor of the shower pan. I could not be bothered to return this Peerless shower system as I need 36 hours in a day, meaning that I am super busy and there are more important things to do but this taught me a lesson to watch out, specifically, for the hose length next time when I buy a new shower system head."
4,"Had it for years, no problems.","I bought this shower system, I think in 2008? I've never had a problem with it. A lot of the reviews I read previously say it's made of cheap plastic. It definitely isn't the strongest plastic, for sure, but mine's never cracked. I also took advice that I read in someone else's review to NOT use tools to install & tighten. Hand tightening is enough. If it leaks, put some silicone tape around the threads & re-attach the unit. I have used this in about, 5 different houses that I've lived in since I bought it, so I've installed it & re-installed it multiple times & haven't had any major issues. From time to time, it will start to leak a bit, but it quits when you hand tighten it back up. It's a good bargain."
3,Its okay,"This was a great shower head. It laste dfor 2 years and then the main plastic washer broke and the head feel apart in the shower while in use. I loved the double shower head ,but not the quality."
2,Careful not to drop it,"As I was installing this shower head, I inadvertently dropped it, and the seem along the main head unit cracked. It is still usable but water now comes out of the side. I imagine it would be a good unit without this flaw, and my carelessness!"
4,Good shower head,"Works well, though one star off for the somewhat clumsy design of how the handheld fits into the shower head"
5,wish i can live in the shower!,"WOW ok this shower head is amazing!!! My husband and I have been looking for a 2-in-1 shower head for months and fell in love when we saw this one. We first saw it at Lowe's for over $100!!! Totally worth the money but soooo glad amazon.com is selling it cheaper. The set up is easy and fast! (just make sure you get rubber washers for it...it came with plastic ones and that always causes leaking) this shower head is like taking a shower under a waterfall! The water just hugs you til you're clean, and the best part is the 2-in-1 shower heads, my husband and I love showering together so we love love LOVE the 2-in-1 shower heads! you can choose to have one on at a time or both at the same time! the removable head has different pressures, the other one does not but its very relaxing!!!!!! LOVE THIS SHOWER HEAD!!! I can't say it enough!! Going to buy more of them for xmas gifts because I need to share to others on how awesome this shower head is! BUY IT!"
4,Not the highest quality but serves its purpose,"I bought this shower head to make giving our dog a bath easier. With the option to use just the hand held sprayer, bath time is quicker and happier for everyone involved. The material is more plasticy than it looks in the picture. There's also no way of knowing which way to turn the knob to go to just the handheld or just the outer spray."
5,Great Product,No complaints. Lived up to other reviews. Great shower head pressure and easy to install.
4,A Keeper,"I received this today as an exchange for the Price-Pfister I bought for $68 last week. Huge improvement over the Delta, as far as pressure and functionality. This is not an elegant fixture, but it sure provides a great shower experience. I rated 4 out of 5 stars because it is going to take some monkeying around to get a tight seal that doesn't drip...I did a ton of research before buying and due to my inability to get good information on a more stylish (and expensive) handheld, I purchased this based on the feedback here. I would recommend this fixture if utility is more important to you than style."
3,Peerless Shower System,"If you have a well, this is not the shower head for you. The shower head does give an overall coverage of water, but the water pressure is just not there even after removing all the water savers."
2,Peerless 76950 2-in-1 We hate it.,"Purchased based on amazon reviews.. I would not gives this to family or friends, but I will attempt to donate it @ the goodwill. I'm not sure how it has a 4 star rating unless it's a fine example of paid reviews.Twist the shower head to a new setting, and you have to fiddle with it. Other wise it sprays out multiple holes that should be off.Lacks a center spray.The massage is very weak. - Compared to previous Peerless shower head that broke.The gray plastic is not attractive.+The nesting head is nice.The outer ring is a nice rain type.The diverter works well, but it can be difficult to turn. It needs a ergonomically designed handle."
3,same price same thing at walmart!,"saw it in walmart the other night. the hose looks real cheap too. but its nice for what it is, i still want it i think, might change out the hose though."
2,Awkward showerhead,"I bought this showerhead because of all the glowing reviews I read, but I really disagree with them.The water flow is anemic, the shower head itself hangs down way too low, it leaks no matter how much tightening/washer replacing/teflon taping that we do, and the hose length is way too short.Despite these faults, I've stuck with these for way too long, but I think I'm going back to Waterpik.Update: I switched to this showerhead, and I'm very happy with it:Waterpik TRS-559 Elements 5-Mode Handheld Shower, Brushed Nickel"
2,Okay but has problems,"Install in a shower stall, the fixed outside part I couldn't use because I could not angle it down enough. The handheld part doesn't have a nice plain shower spray. Plus the coupling that the handheld hung on leaked; after I replaced this shower system I discovered cause of the leak, the gasket has a split in it the more I tightened the coupling the bigger the gap would be come, just a bad design."
1,Piece of Crap Cord Cracked!,We didn't like it.It does take up all of your hot water if you use both heads.It broke after 2 months of use! b/c the cord cracked and started leaking.I read all of the reviews on here and figured it would be fantastic and the best thing ever b/c so many people liked it. NO!and I didn't get my money back or money's worth and amazon cannot cover the warranty only the company and I didn't pursue it further.Instead I bought a Waterpik TRS-553 Elements 5-Mode Handheld Shower and I've had it for 9 months and no problems.
5,Even Better Than Advertised,"I was looking for a replacement shower head for my VERY old shower and stumbled across this one (I just love amazon.com and check here first for anything I want or need).. Couldn't beat the price and I was skeptical so I did read all the reviews. I went ahead and ordered it and I could not be happier with it. I am on well water and you know that the water pressure with a well leaves a lot to be desired.. With this new shower head, the pressure is wonderful. I love the detachable piece.. makes cleaning and rinsing the shower so much easier, not to mention giving a dog a bath.. You know the old saying you get what you pay for... in this case and in my opinion, you get a lot more than what you pay for."
1,Didn't like it at all,"I bought this product because there are way too many good reviews but I will give my reasons for not liking it.- hose too small- hose is inflexible so if you have a caddy hanging off the shower, it is always hitting it and something is falling off the caddy.- water pressure was ok but oxygenics was better.- You need to turn both the heads to get a good coverage but then it is dispersing 5 gpm as it is 2.5 gpm per head- one leaked right off the back- it is not easy to turn on both the heads without disturbing the caddyso this one is definitely not for me."
5,great coverage,"One of the best purchases I have made all year! Easy to install, great pressure, lots of coverage, was worth the extra $$ for fast shipping!"
5,TRULY PEERLESS,"I must admit, I was a little hesitant because of the low price, but I ordered this shower system anyway. My sweet husband installed it in a snap and we've been love, love, LOVING it ever since!! The change in water pressure alone, compared to our old shower head, is absolutely amazing. I'd recommend the Peerless 76950 2-in-1 a thousandfold. It's one of my favorite all time buys -- and I'm a Shopper!!!Peerless 76950 2-in-1 Shower System, Chrome"
5,Love It,"Wanted to replace existing fixed showerhead with a handheld version. I also love rainfall-style showers. Who knew I could have both? I've had it for a couple of weeks now and am very pleased. It was simple to install (5 minutes, no plumbing expertise required) with no leaking problems as some have experienced. Yes, it's made of plastic and likely won't last a lifetime, but for less than $35 bucks, you can't really go wrong."
4,Peerless Showerhead,"I bought this item based primarily on the positive reviews on Amazon. My main concern was water-pressure, (I like tree and conservation - But value pressure over water saving every day.) Overall this shower head is good, but the pressure leaves a little to be desired...I removed the water restrictors with a pair of liers and it helps, but still not quite the blasting I was hoping for.... I have also tried the Delta shower head that is similarly designed. That showerhead has the push button water pause and a little better water pressure, however for 1/2 the price this showerhead is a good buy."
5,Fine For The Price,Feel like the quality is on par for the price. Spray features are nice and actually attractive. Would recommend it.Installed with no tools. Everything is just hand tight and does not leak.Our water pressure is low and all the features still work. No doubt the message feature would work better with higher pressure.Update: As other have stated the plastic smell is a bit strong and does not seem to be going away. It doesn't bug me; others may be more sensitive to such odors. It smells like some kind of additive leaching out of the flex hose.
1,Falls apart,"Great water flow, but shower head keeps falling apart. The head fits on a plastic ball to pivot, but won't stay put. Falls off daily."
1,This product does indeed leak,"Yes, the leak reviews you read are true. Based on the reviews, most users never see a problem but there are a large amount of defective shower heads being built along with good shower heads. Unfortunately, I am one of the lucky users to get a lemon.The leak is from the 3 way valve area. All valves included were rubber and there were no loose internal components in the 3 way valve. When I first installed the valve by the directions ( no teflon tape, hand tight)and turned on the water there was water spraying out of the seam in the valve in all directions. I removed the valve, added teflon tape and installed the valve using a wrench. The spraying went away but there was a constant drip. A lot of reviews saw this drip and were okay with it. I am definetely not okay with a defective item and this product is returning to Amazon for a full refund immediately!"
4,Peerless 76950,"It was a little of a hassle to install. Even though I installed it using the white plumber tape, it still has some small leaks but its nothing you would notice. It does not spray water like when it did not have the tape. The pressure and features are great. The cord is around 3ft long and the whole shower is made of hard plastic. Might need to buy an adapter because this shower head is lower than usual."
4,shower blast,Great Product and a fantastic price compared to home builders supply stores. I realy enjoy the full spray of water I get with every shower and the wife also enjoys the full amount of water when washing her hair before it use to take what seemed to be for ever to rinse the shampoo off her hair
2,Will not hold position after 4 months,"I was happy with this shower head. I liked the pressure, the adjustments, and the shutoff valve.Unfortunately after four months the pivot that holds the shower head at the position you want lost its ability to hold the shower head in position. The pivot operates on friction and it seems the parts have worn down just enough that the friction is no longer sufficient to hold the shower head in position."
1,"Way too low, I can't stand under the water","I am really not sure why this product has gotten such great reviews. The shower Head its self is ok, nothing great. But it sits so low that I can barely stand under it. I am only 5'6"", My husband who is 5'10"" Has to point the head so it kinda squirts out horizontally at him. I know it's not my shower that was installed to low, I have had both a Delta and a Moen Handheld shower head and they left us plenty of room to actually shower. Too bad I really liked the idea of this shower head."
2,Will not stand up to daily use,"I purchased this a year ago and found that it worked great for the first 6 months or so. Slowly, with daily use of the hand-held portion of the shower-head the connections start to wear. I noticed leaks developing so I re-applied teflon tape, bought new washers, etc. No change to the leak and it is getting worse with each day. The main problem I see is that most of the product is a thinner plastic. The only metal piece is base piece where it connects to the main water line out of the wall. The rest is plastic. So, this works great for a temporary solution but has not held up over the first year of use. I read think most of the 5 star reviews must have been written in the first 6 months of use. This shower-head doesn't hold up over time."
2,didn't last long...plastic broke on hand held part,"Initially my husband loved this shower head that we installed in our mudroom shower, but it only lasted a few months. The connection from the hose to the hand held shower head broke. It's just plastic."
2,Peerless fix,"I bought this shower head because it looked most useful for my hygeine needs. Well just like everyone else, water flew from almost every connection point. The fix,think about if you had engineered this device, you would most likely use only metal parts as I am sure the original design called for, however that may cut into your profit margin, so a manager decided plastic would look great and in a perfect world would work great. But is that not how it`s working for us the consumers. So I was down to what should I do? replace it, if its old; or should I(my husband) replace the bad parts. he decided to spend 15 bucks on the metal hose and 15 more on a metal diverter. Now I think it will last me for ever and not so much as a tiny leak. Best of luck"
2,Disappointed,"Im the type of person who does research before purchasing anything... i like to spend my money wisely and buy quality products that will last me for a long time... Well, at the time of purchase, this product had high ratings... Well, i have had my peerless two in one shower system now for approx. 6 months... well, the first 4 months, it worked freaking awesome... but now, two of the four settings on the shower head no longer work... those settings now just dribble the water out. ;/"
4,Showerhead Turned Out Great,"I was worried about getting a new showerhead because I thought it might not give me the right amount of pressure or coverage.I'm very picky about my showers.So I'm very happy to report that this showerhead turned out great!Of course the best part of this shower is that it still sprays you even after you take the handheld showerhead off. This is good for couple's showering: you can both stay warm under the water. It's also nice to have such wide coverage and flexibility with your showering.With this showerhead, you can change the settings and turn off either head if you prefer. All settings are good and provide good water pressure.I installed it with plumber's tape on all joints, and no leaks."
5,Just right,Easy to install. Great water spread. Also adjusts quickly. Perfect for rinsing the dog without making him lie down in the tub.
2,Not well designed,"Cons:1- Stiff hose does not hang straight down, it sticks out into shower area.2- Every time I take out the removable shower head the rest of the shower head wobbles- the connection is stiff. Same thing happens when I put the removable shower head back.3- The assembly lowers the height of the shower head by several inches. OK if you're short, bad if you're tall.4- This does not affect the performance, but it has a cheap plastic feel.Take off one star, or two.Amazon deducted $7.00 for shipping return from purchase price even though product is totally unusable."
4,Very nice,Very nice shower head for the price. It installed pretty quickly and we've used it for 3 months now with no leaking. I would recommend this shower head for the price.
3,Fails to deliever,"Sorry, this unit is a cheaply made piece of plastic.Requires to much water to be affective. Save your money and get a better brand."
3,Brrr,"I've always complained when a shower head doesn't have enough water pressure, but this may be too much. Maybe we have a weak water heater, but by the end of the shower it's already cold (and that's using only half of this shower head!) I rarely turn both parts of the shower head on together as it would severely cut down the shower time.I love the idea of the removable handle while the main part of the shower head still sprays. The settings are great and there's a lot of options.My other complaint is that the removable part of the head sometimes falls unexpectedly.Maybe my problem is not with this shower system, but never experienced it with the old shower head."
2,Uses excessive amounts of water,"I installed this at my mother's home. It went up very quickly with no trouble. It has great pressure out of both pieces and looks great.I liked it so much that I installed one at my home.At both locations, the second person to shower would run out of hot water. This was never a problem at either location prior to installing this. In fact, we even changed out the elements at my mother's home thinking this was the problem.If you use both nozzles of this showerhead at the same time, you will run out of hot water.Unfortunately, you have to rip apart the plastic packaging to open it. Otherwise, I would definitely be returning this for a refund.I am replacing both showers with different heads that use less water.UPDATE (4/2011):The upgrade was to theKOHLER K-17493-CP Flipside 01 Handshower, Polished Chrome. We've used this for over a year and it is great."
3,Disappointed with water pressure,"I have owned this shower head for over a year now. I bought it because I have a dog and need the ability to use the hand held portion on her, without sacrificing the full coverage feel. I would have expected the hand held to have more water pressure when all water it channeled to it, yet it does not. When both portions are going the hand held portions does nto fill the center of the shower radius, instead it just droops down leaving a gap in the water coverage. This shower head is ok, a good idea but not not living up to my expectations. Currently I am looking for a replacement."
3,Looks like a short term fixture,"I got this because the old hand held shower started leaking after 2.5 years. It was easy and quick to install, it does have wide spaying area and the head fits nicely into the outer horse shoe piece. It does, however, feel cheap and I am not expecting it to last very long."
4,great shower head with sprayer,"Easy to install...directions very clear...just need some plumbing tape to apply to the threads of the pipe before placing the faucet connection on. NO leaking. If you have a shower caddy, depending upon how low it hangs from the main shower pipe, you may have to make adjustments so that the plastic tubing to the detachable shower head, can fit down rather than sticking out to the side."
4,Works great,"The product works great, and would probably be better if my water pressure was higher. I would buy another one or recommend this to anyone. Cheap and works, what more do you want?"
5,Work It!!!!,"I didn't waste money buying with this shower system. It was extremely easy to put together (5 Min. if that). Sturable and Sturdy. It's common sense how to work it. I love it!!!! And the best part about it is the detachable shower head. I have a 2 year old who hates getting her hair washed. This has made it so much easier for her. I also have two dogs that get bathed regularly. This shower system is the perfect fit. It's very easy to install and use. The water pressure is pretty good. I didn't expect it to be like the regular shower heads. It's not as powerful but it's still a good pressure. It saves water, makes my daughters hair washing experience better and helps save me a lot of strain on my back when I wash my dogs. My entire house benefits from it. I highly recommend this product to parents of small kids and pet owners. Even if I didn't have a child or dogs, I would still order this product."
3,Good and Bad,"I love this product, the only negatives I would give it would be that it uses too much water (empties our large hot water tank completely with one shower). Also the instructions indicated that it just needed to be hand tightened, which did not work whatsoever (soaked the bathroom). You need to use a wrench and plumbers tape to get it fully tight so no leaks occur.All in all it's a great product!EDIT: After a couple of years I would rate this lower. The hose isn't long enough so it's difficult to give the dog a bath... not something that is HORRIBLE but it becomes a huge chore to wash the dog. Also, I have to have it on the dual option where both pieces are on. I can't get a comfortable spray with just one or the other. The problem is it completely empties the hot water tank. All in all it is okay, but we're going to be purchasing another shower head due to this one's faults."
5,nice product and great price,"The set up is easy and the 3 spray options are nice. I wish my water pressure if higher, but otherwise no complains. Great price for sure."
4,Great Shower System,"This shower systems provides a great water flow. It was simple to install. Some minor leaking at the connection to the shower pipe, which does not seem to be much of a problem. We have had it about one month and have been very pleased with its performance to this point."
1,"Good idea, awful execution",Bought this to replace another two-in-one system and thought this would be a nice one that could have a rain-water like effect.However after hooking it up as soon as I turned the water on to the shower-head a gushing stream of water came out of the hose connecting the hand-held shower head to the diverter valve. No matter what I tried I couldn't keep a tight connection and it seems like a terrible design defect because the screw connector from the hose to the hand-held simply is too long and doesn't allow the hose to get a proper fitting.Steer clear of the product unless you want to have a few extra showers going on.
2,"Awsome idea, Failure to deliver",Loved the idea of the 2 in 1. After looking at several decided on this one for the overall rating and price. At first it was eh ok. It seemed to lack pressure when using both functions. Then after just a couple of months of use the dial to change function has become almost impossible to turn. I've even applied WD-40. Probably would not recommend this item.
3,"Good Product, average construction","I love the shower head. It gives great water pressure and is fairly easy to install. The only problem I have is with the diverter. It is plastic and so much water comes out the connection between the body of the diverter and where it is attached to the shower, you get wet just turning it on. I plan to send the piece back to the manufacturer to get it replaced. Better quality in this piece would make this a great shower head."
3,This is a great value.,"I have a small fortune in shower heads, and this one is just what we needed. Pressure! It has the pulse and stuff that I don't think anybody ever uses, but just leave it on regular spray and you will be able to get your hair clean! We don't have low water pressure, but we do have a well. This is a great value."
3,leaks,"My shower head leaks at the turn-dial and nowhere else, like at the fittings as expected. otherwise a decent unit with decent flow."
3,"NOT a water saver, but an ok shower head","I was looking for a quality shower head and found it in this peerless model. However, it is NOT a water saver by any stretch of the imagination. If you use both heads at the same time, you're using 5 gpm which is a LOT! It's an enjoyable shower experience, but water is expensive where I live so I don't have the luxury of being able to waste water. If you're eco consious then I do NOT recommend this shower head, as you will be thinking about how much water you're wasting every time you take a shower. On the other hand, if you just want a reasonably priced, good shower head without consideration for the water consumption, then this shower head may be just for you. I'll sell you mine, dirt cheap! ;-)"
1,So much praise for cheap junk?,"I'm trying hard to figure out where all the raves are coming from for this product. It's cheap and flimsy, and there's absolutely nothing impressive about it.First impression out of the packaging is ""Oh, wow... I screwed up this time."" Cheap grey plastic everywhere. Install it and you'll find that it pivots and wobbles. Snap out the hand-shower and you feel like the whole thing will come down. And the plastic hose looks like something from your kitchen that is hidden beneath the sink (for good reason). Trying the shower, you get a lackluster, weak spray at best, and the whole thing hangs down so far that you have to duck your head to get under the water.Needless to say, this thing is going back. My advice is to spend the extra $20 and get the full chrome Kohler rain/hand shower that is exclusively sold at Bed, Bath, and Beyond. That one rocks.Then again, if you wanna learn ""you get what you pay for,"" go ahead and buy this one. :)"
1,Leaks for me too:,"I also made the mistake by thinking the other reviews, as of today 11/11/2009, 11 total, did not install this shower-head correctly. Well I made sure I did install it correctly, well it leaked everywhere for me as well. Thus, my one star, I just took it down, put aside, wasted the money. Beware of this product!NOW THERE ARE 12 ONE STAR REVIEWS."
3,The Leak Problem Solved,I note that several reviewers have downrated this item for leaking. I too on installation found it to have a severe leaking problem. After considerable frustrating investigation of the problem I found the solution. On the interior of the three way diverter where it attaches to the shower head there is a threaded piece that in my unit was not properly tightened as received. Tightening this piece with a large screwdriver or an allen wrench will solve the leaking problem. The inadequate installation instructions make no mention of this piece.Therefore I consider this a 5-star product for which I deduct 2 stars for inadequate attention to assembly and installation instruction.
2,finally fixed it..I hope..,"Well after spending way to much time reading every review for every shower head here on Amazon, I finally decided to buy this unit.. I've installed dozens of shower systems and this seemed like a no-brainer.. Well not so fast. It was leaking all over so I applied tons of teflon compound on both the main unit threads and the handheld attachments threads.. still leaking and really weak water flow. Tightening with a wrench just scratched the cheap paint off and almost cracked the other attachment. After re-reading another user review I took it apart and removed the flow restrictor. Presto.. no more leaks and way better water pressure.. Do your self a favor.. pass on this unit.. the massager is very weak. I've had better units for $20 cheaper from Kmart."
2,Cannot agree with other reviews,"I'm confused by all the rave reviews. The pressure is abysmal despite good pressure behind it. The hose is low quality and winds the way it wants, getting in the way. Mine was turned on for five minutes and will be returned to Amazon."
5,Great showerhead!,"This showerhead was so much nicer than I expected for the money! I was happy to find that it has so many settings. Also, it has great water pressure! I have long hair and it takes me much less time to rinse the shampoo than before. I am very happy with this purchase!"
3,"Great Idea But So-So Execution, Installation Gotchas","I'll be the first to admit that I really like this shower head. What doesn't give me a warm and fuzzy feeling is how lightly it's constructed. I'll be surprised if it lasts more than a year or two. Still it's so nice that I won't mind replacing it every couple of years.One other thing to keep in mind is how long this thing is. If you look closely at the picture you'll see that the shower head will sit roughly 2-3"" lower than a standard shower head. So unless you're under 5'6"" you may want to replace the pipe coming out of the wall with a pipe that raises this shower head up a few inches. I'm fairly handy with tools and replaced the pipe for with one of these s-curved pipes. 8"" Antique Copper S-Curved Shower Head Wall Arm Pipe I'm guestimating that a plumber will charge you $100-120 parts and labor to replace the pipe. It's not hard to do but obviously if you do it yourself you'll need to be careful to avoid leaks inside your wall."
3,Depends on what you're looking for . . .,"For someone who's most interested in having a full, rain-shower type showerhead, with the option of using a handheld attachment on occasion, and at an affordable price, this would probably rate 4-5 stars. However, I realized after using it for a while that it really matters to me to be able to use the handheld showerhead with NO spray or dribble coming from the wall-mounted unit, and that was a problem for me with this one. There's a switch that supposedly diverts all the water to the hand shower, but it was stiff, difficult to turn, and never really seemed to close off the flow to the wall-mounted showerhead all the way. I ended up regretfully going back to my old handheld-only model."
3,"fun, but flawed. it","this is a good shower head if you have decent water pressure. We have a tankless heater that puts out less pressure on the Hot water. this shower head needs more than we are giving it.nice chrome finish, and the fact that you can set it to 'wall, hand, or both' is nice.also the hose is fairly flexible and plenty long.this showerhead does not save water. NOT GREEN.The massage factor is a bit of a joke, especially since ours stopped working within 2 months of purchase. There is a disc inside the hand-held that should spin when set to massage, creating a stop in the flow. The disc stopped spinning."
1,leaked,it sprayed water from the side control where one switches from full to just shower wand. factory defect.. sent back for a refund...
4,Good shower system. Could have better pressure.,"I like this shower system. However, I do wish it had a bit more water pressure. It isn't terrible, though. I can live with it. It looks really nice and was a good price."
3,Nice... but,"Great concept, however, it seems to need too much water pressure to work properly. It is made of mostly plastic and feels really cheap. It doesn't swivel enough to be really functional and the hose is too stiff for comfortable use at times. We still use it, but would like to find something better."
1,peerless76950 peice of crap,had this product less than 1 year and the spray is not strong and it leek's around the switch conected to the water flow would not buy agian or recomend to any one
4,great shower experience,"I had bought this shower head to replace the old, dribbley one that was already installed in the shower when we bought the house.I went online and researched, and selected this Peerless 2-1 system. It was extremely easy to install, fit well, and is easy to maneuver. The handheld is easy to hold, lightweight, and hose is very flexible.The two in one system is very nice when you need both the traditional spray & the handheld. It is nice to be able to switch the center (handheld) spray patterns to give a custom experience. We have low-average water pressure and the spray is great! The cris-cross spray is unique.It has a good wide range, without being too wide that it goes around you. And it is smooth to adjust the whole head up & down to the right angle between me (5'5"" and my roomate 6'4"").This model has outperformed the more expensive WaterPik models that are at my parent's house. I would recommend this to anyone in need of a very reasonably priced shower head."
4,Great shower head for the price,You cannot beat this price! It's a great shower head with plenty of versatility. I would not reccommend for heavy handed people. Very easy install too!
3,CHEAP!,Received product in a timely manner. Quality of product was not as expected. quality of material product was made of was inferior and cheap. Not at all pleased with this unit.
3,heavy shower head,"Although a great product, but due to its heavy shower head, it loosens after a period of use. Every once in a while, i say about two weeks on average, we have to tighten up the the shower head so it will stay on a upright position. other than that, it's ok!"
4,Excellent compared to alternative,I have used this shower head for two weeks and it has worked great. The only problem I have with it is the resistance of the surround head to movements of the hand shower. I wish it was harder to it to move around. The alternative to this puppy is over $100. Now I can have a peaceful shower with my GF at the same time without having to do a time share on the single shower head.
1,cheap plastic and leaks.,"Easy to assemble, however the shoqwer head is cheap plastic chrome. The unit leaks. Be sure to use plumbers tape as well as both of the washers they send you."
4,Great book for the basics!!,"This book is a great resource for new parents wanting to feed their baby homemade food. The recipes and instructions are simple to follow. The division by age is an invaluable resource as far as what to feed your child when. I like that this book does not criticize formula feeding, nor is it preachy about organics and vegetarian options, as many baby food books seem to be. If you're looking for the basics- this is a great book!"
2,Not really a meal planner,"This book gets 2 stars for its nice recipies and cute dancing vegetables. Other reviewers have brought up safety/health concerns, but my main beef is that it calls itself a meal planner. Though it does have a requisite page for each age group featuring a ""meal plan"", I don't know how you'd accomplish such a meal plan unless you employ a nanny to watch your babe(s) while you cook, or a full time chef to make these baby foods for you. I was hoping for practical advice about actual meal planning and EFFICIENT ways to mesh baby feeding with feeding the rest of the family. I found none of that here. The closest she comes is to say that certain purees would make good soups for adults."
3,More complicated than it needs to be,"I bought this book and Ruth Yaron's Super Baby Food book and I much prefer Yaron's book. This book is packed with recipes but weak in the area of educating mothers about the specific nutritional needs for babies. It's a prettier book than Yaron's, but it doesn't have the depth of information of Yaron's. Also, with so many recipes to try, I found that as a working mom, it was much harder to get the cooking done with this book than it is under Yaron's plan. I also agree with other reviewers about some contradictions within the book about when to start certain food and the four day wait rule for trying new foods. In short, if you only want to buy one baby food book, this isn't the one."
4,easy and fun recipes as well as info on infant nutrition,"This book makes cooking baby food very easy! I buy a few organic vegetables every week, boil them, puree and presto! Healthy, nutritious baby food that my baby loves. Some of the recipes are a bit strange, (i.e. zucchini and bananas), but if the baby likes it, so be it. My only complaint is that some of the menus seem to rush the baby into new foods too quickly. My recommendation is that you only give your baby one new food at a time for at least three days. Because my husband and I did this, we were able to discern that she was very allergic to pears."
3,misinformation,"While I think the recipes are good some of the author's suggestions are the complete opposite of what you read everywhere else. You shouldn't be giving a baby egg whites/whole eggs before 12 months and you certainly could feed the baby new fruits and veg without spacing them out every three days to watch for a reaction, but why would you want to?"
5,Great for vegetarian (meatless) babies and toddlers.,I used this book to feed my son who does not eat meat or poultry. I found the recipes easy to prepare and so did my son's nanny who could not cook prior to working for us.
4,Great interesting receipes,"I love this cookbook. I agree with some others about when to introduce certain foods is not well researched. This is a great addition to Ruth Yaron's Super Baby Food Book though. Ruth Yaron does not have any meat recipes. I wanted to feed my children meat, so this gave some great interesting recipes. Learn when to feed from Super Baby Food, and use this book for great recipes."
3,Not What I was Looking For,"This book includes great recipes. The problem I had is I bought it for my husband to use when he's home alone with our daughter and the recipes weren't what he needs. Also, just browsing through it, it seemed many of the recipes required frying of some sort which we never do. We need something that includes baking recipes or little prep - things you can do when you have a toddler pulling on your leg or when you just want to make lunch and fast."
2,Too English for us Yanks?,"I was excited to order this pretty book, hoping that I would find new inspiration. Alas, it seems ill-suited to a North American market. Beyond the neverending variation on purees, the taste combinations are often just too odd, the recipes too time consuming, and the ""advice"" too off-putting (when it's not completely out of step with US pediatric standards). A much older kid might go for these taste combinations, but not any toddler or pre-schooler I know. If I were a kid in London, I'd head straight for Nigella Lawson's."
1,Too meat intensive,"We hastily bought this book for a friend and just as quickly returned it after taking a look at it's content. If you're still on the carnivor boat and wish to expose your child to the high dioxin and chemical load found in meat, then this book's for you. If you're a bit more informed and concerned about the contamination of meat, then look elsewhere for alternative nutrition and recipe info.As a pharmacist, let me tell you that children are exceptionally sensitive to the chemical contamination that is in U.S. produced meat. This ain't the good ol' days and meat has changed. Be very careful where your animal products come from or consider eliminating them altogether."
5,Wonderful resource,"This book is great! I received as a gift at a baby shower and I love it. Great recipes, lots of information. Haven't found another book yet that compares. One thing to note, be sure to ask your pediatrician before doing some foods at her suggested age. Everyone has to decide for themselves but I found her suggestions were a little early with dairy and eggs. Overall, best book, all my friends have borrowed."
5,helpful ideas!,"I loved the idea of making all my babys' food, not hard to imagine that I ended up buying more than I origianly wanted... lol. But this book does have really great ideas and helpful hints and such. Even if you only prepare homemade meals once a week, it's worth it. :P"
4,Easy starter cook book,I checked out many books from the library and this is the one I used. I like that it gives sample menus for the week. I like the information on food allergies and basic stuff one doesn't know the first time around.I checked it out so much that my husband just bought this one and the one for the next age up.
2,"Good recipies, but conflicting Information.","As a first time mom making babyfood at home, I thought this book would help me outline a plan of when and what to feed my baby. However, I was disappointed that the plan it gave was based on starting a 4 month old on solids and juice, both which were discouraged by my pediatrician. I started my baby at 6 months, so I found it hard to follow this plan. And it also had its readers introduce more than one new food at once, also discouraged. I may use a couple of the recipies when my baby gets older, but as for the ""Healthy Baby Meal Plan"" it was not useful."
3,"A good start, but watch the allergies.","It's a good start for those who want to make homemade food and don't know where to begin. There are some interesting recipes in there. Just watch the ingredients if you're worried about allergies in infants. Many of these contain egg yolks or dairy, which may not be recommended in your baby's age group. I was excited to get it, but have to admit I didn't use much."
4,Great Book for parents who love the kitchen,"OK. I know that we all don't have time to ""cook"" all of our baby food...but even if you may want to supplement your baby food jar collection with some of your own, this is a GREAT book. It gave me some great ideas, and also gives you good information (like what can my 6 year old REALLY handle...) The recipes for older babies and toddlers are really good (I eat them too!) Great for those that are ""tired"" of the jarred peas and carrots - if your baby is in a slump, try out some of these recipes for some interesting foods!"
2,Ok... but Controversial,"Like several other comments, this book says to feed baby carrots and parsnips. My baby's doctor specifically said NOT to do this because of nitrate levels. Also the author introduced cow's milk yogurt at 8 months. I asked my baby's doctor about this, and she said not until at least a year. The cover of the book also says ""healthy"" and some recipes ask you to feed 6 month old baby BUTTER! Good for the pallet but not for the whole. Otherwise, I really enjoy how the book explains the recipes, the author gives much information on the vitamins in different foods. These are definitely easy to follow recipes. I've used this book for about a month and half now, and haven't bought another one. Just do your research first (the author obviously didn't), many foods not good for baby. Toddler recipes seem easy and are good for the whole family... I am eager to get to these recipes and away from the baby ones."
3,"Entertaining to read, though not one of Shirow's best","This book is reccomended to those who are more interested to Masamune's humorous side....Technical at times, but does not par to his best ""Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Orion."""
4,Caution!,"Great product. But be careful. Contrary to what the website tells you, this product cannot expand up to 4 handsets. Just 3 in total."
5,My Mark 8 is happy / great product,There really isn't much you can say about things like motors other than how easy they were to install or how well they work after you install them. In some cases they don't work at all. Let me say that in my case everything worked out just fine and the motor works very well but then it is a new part and it should work well. The window now works and it was very easy to put in. All in all great product.
4,power motor,motor works good the reason i gave it 4 stars is the lead that i needed was smashed and i had to cut my old one and use it.
3,Dorman 742-250,This item does not exactly fit my car item was for the wrong side window and took a lot to find a way to make it workalso not a lot of power motor seems to struggle when lifting the window
5,Great TV,"I have owned this TV now for over a year and I have not ha any kind of problems with it at all. I love the TV, Lots of different option with how you wanna view things on it. Good pick up adn comes with HD tuner already in it!"
4,Very good buy,"I bought this television unit about four months ago. I got an exceptional price on it, and I've been nothing but satisfied with the purchase. I was originally looking for a flat-panel television, but I was attracted to this one because it has the look of a flat-panel from the front. The only downside is that it's very heavy, but it's well worth the weight. I haven't had any problems with picture clarity, or any weird effects. As far as I'm concerned, picture clarity is top notch and I'd imagine it'd look even better if you had an HD box as well. Depending on the size of your living room, the 30-inch screen size might be a bit small, but this TV would work wonders in a bedroom.Excellent choice if you're buying this unit."
1,Horrible TV,"My set suffers from the same problems that everyone else who commented seems to be having. Ghosting of images, colorful bluish line that's always present in the top right. It's being serviced right now by Associated Electronics in Wisconsin, and they don't even return phone calls. Even when I first got this set, the picture was terrible. We tried to save money by buying a Samsung instead of a good brand, and now regret it. We will probably just take a deep breath and purchase a nice TV from a good brand, specifically a 32in. Bravia XBR. Do yourself a favor, buy a good TV, not this one."
1,Get an LCD instead,"I bought this TV in May 2006, a friend had just bought one and it looked great, so I went out and got one too. Not too long after I purchased my set, my friends TV started acting up, same old stuff everyone else complains of with these sets, weird geometry, focus problems, etc.. Finally after 3 repair attempts and 2 replacements Samsung took back the TV and gave him credit towards an LCD.At first the picture was great. Now 11 months into my purchase, my set has totally died. I first noticed purple and green vertical stripes in dark areas of the picture about 2 months ago. Then the other night the picture distorted like it was wrapped around a balloon and after a few minutes the set just went dead, hasn't turned back on since. The only positive is that this happened just before the manufacturer's warranty expires.So now my adventure in dealing with Samsung customer service and TV repair people begins. Can't wait to see how it ends...."
2,Major Distortion in Widescreen Mode,"The price is nice. The TV looks great, but the picture is not good. I received the TV two days ago after purchasing it from Amazon. Delivery was prompt and went smoothly. Unfortunately, there is major distortion along the edges in the form of shadows in the 16:9 mode. I have to assume that it is a defective TV. I have looked for other reviews on the internet and found many complaints about this model. I wouldn't recommend buying it online; better to get from a local retailer so that you can return or exchange it if defective. Now I get to find out if Samsung customer service is any good."
1,a lemon,"an impulse buy. enjoyed for the first month but then started to notice wierd purple stuff in the left corners that was only visible when there were bright oranges or reds on the screen. then started noticing rainbow bars on the right side. very annoying. guy at best buy said that this was actually not the first time he had heard about the purple, and that these tv's are cheeply made. upgrading to dlp. despite what some reviewers here are saying, samsung's customer service has been nothing but helpful with me so far."
1,Don't bother unless you want a pain in the neck,"Colors, lines, picture are all standard/substandard. There are much better TVs on the market for less at the time of this review.My wife and I bought this TV a while ago and within 2 months returned it to the store because the COAX input just randomly stopped working. With the second one, the upper left of the screen began to have the blue/purple clouds when the screen was yellow or red. Again, the TV was replaced. Now the replacement it about 1.5 years old and the discoloration is back and growing worse exponentially. Samsung gave me the service shop's number to which I received a $375 repair estimate."
3,Needs better instructions,"I got this kit because I thought it would be lessy messy then a paint by numbers. My 9 year old likes paint by numbers but on trips or waiting at the dr paints are not a choice.The kit contains what you would expect, small numbered colored pencils, a sharpner, an overlay and a carboard picture to color. I did not find the quality of the supplies to be anywhere near the full retail price, but on sale it seemed fairly priced.My 9 year old could color the outside parts fine, the numbers are on the inlay so the middle of the picture is a little more challenging for a child.My one problem is that in order to make the picture look like the one on the box , you have to use alot of shading techniques. There are no specfic techniques to use in the kit. I didn't expect the picture to turn out to be a masterpiece but I thought it would be more of a teaching tool about the shading and how to get the lighting effects."
4,I can see to the sea,"I have trouble with Thomas Kincaid paper. I was so happy to see that this paper was fairly smooth and the crayons went on evenly. Colors seem to change after being on paper ouvernight. But the total effect is still lovely. I have trouble with his small spaces, why so many small spaces and different colors in each space or several spaces side by side with the same color in the blocks? The finished picture was lovely though. I must press too hard because the crayons are down to nubbins by the end of the picture."
1,Only one decent song,"Faron Young was a honky tonk western swing boogie woogie hillbilly singer in the 40's, however there is only one classic track here fro mthe 40's that swings, and the rest are 1970's redos, with dated backup singers. The funny thing is the one old track from the 40's sounds great while the redos from the70's sound muffled. Awful cd, sped a few more bucks and get something on a name brand label, of his classic hillbilly boogie sides fro mthe late 40's early 50's, when his music was hip and swingin'"
4,Looking for fraud,"Lamont writes well, followed a thread to the end. But, he spent way too much time trying to prove DD Hume a fraud. Rather than trying to understand the man and his work. Plus he got diverted a great deal with other mediums who were quite likely fraudulent, at least at times. Lamont's conclusion, despite all EVIDENCE to the contrary, was that Hume was a charlatan. Maybe the pot was trying to call the kettle black. Better luck with your next book, Mr. Lamont."
5,Like no other short stories,Each story is a slice of a character's life. The reader joins a life in progress. You really feel like you know the characters in just a few pages. Fromm is the best short story writer out there.
5,The Essential SOS Band Album,"Without a doubt this is the best album ever relesed by the now disbanded SOS Band, Jam & Lewis at the height of their popularity and creativity. It is the perfect album to kick back to and enjoy the summer by the pool with Enjoy........."
4,Jam/Lewis works for Me,"The songs contributed by songmeisters Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis elevate this recording to ""good"" status. The SOS Band, though never attaining superstar status, provided many of the best R & B songs of the 80's. This album is a fine showcase of their soulful talent."
4,The Best of ............,"This is a nice album, but the Best of SOS Band album from Tabu Records from 1995 is the best album... or compilation. it has 3 cuts from this album, plus all the hits: take your time, Even When you sleep, weekend girl, tell me if you still care, just be good to me, sand of time, no one's gonna love you, high hopes, and what's wrong with our love affair(which it could have done without). back when funk grooves were real music... By the way, this album isn't even listed on CDNOW..."
4,Love It,"I read this book to my 2 year old granddaugther and 3 year old grandson. They love it. The book displays the special relationship between a grandfather and grandchild. I recently ordered ""Grandmother and I"" which I am sure they will love at least as much. It is refreshing to see books illustrated with people who look like us."
4,Great Book to Get Started,"This book was a very helpful beginning to understanding the relationship of country gospel to both country and gospel music. It brings up a lot of major players that gave me a quick glance at where they fit in and where to begin searching if I wanted more info. From the Carter Family to the Gospel influence in more contemporary County, this book was a quick and enjoyable overview."
2,you get what you pay for,I was looking for a compass to put on my daughters bike and bought a couple of these. It does not work very well wether it is on the bike or away from the bike.
4,Collapse the FM antenna,"The ICF-S10 is a pretty good AM/FM pocket transistor radio for the money. However, as the previous reviewer noted, the FM section does suffer from signal overload in strong-signal areas (such as in cities where there are lots of transmitters). When that happens, you usually find one station at 2 or 3 parts on the dial.I've found that keeping the FM whip antenna collapsed helps keep such interference to a minimum. All things said, however, it's a nice-sounding radio for its size."
3,just your average radio,"I purchased this radio about a year ago at a department store and found it to be just ok, nothing out of the ordinary. AM reception is good, but FM isn't great. In weak signal areas FM reception is good but in strong signal areas it picks up a lot of interference and because of this it won't pull in the distant stations well. Other than that it's very small so it is convienient to carry around. It also has a telescopic antenna for FM that can be extended and pivoted left or right to get the best reception. I used mine at the beach and it worked well particularly because there was no strong signal where I went. Overall it makes a great pocket radio but if you live where there's strong FM reception I'd recommend looking for another model."
4,Pssst!,This exact same model and number is available in a silver version that is usually a couple of dollars cheaper. Just thought you'd like to know!
3,boring,This book was read for a class I took. It has some interesting situations. But the writing is boring and tiresome.
4,about as easy to understand as a technical book can get,"For examples, all of the measures of all of the inventions are given in musical notation. Thus, it is possible to read this book without holding a score in the other hand.The book is insightful. I have read a dissertation on the two-part inventions, and Johnson notices a few technical details which the dissertation missed.The book would be somewhat easier to understand if here were a heading for each section of each invention."
3,"Poor, even for a science book","As a second year biology major I have read a good deal of science books. They are generally fairly dry, however, iGenetics: A Mendelian Approach was especially bad. There are numerous instances where they book mislabels figures and where the book is flat out wrong. For instance, in two different chapters the book reviews Mendel's two laws. The explanations of the differences between the laws are different in each chapter. This is the basis of the Mendelian Approach and the book gets it wrong. I would like to be able to say that the issues were fixed in the second edition but that was never released. Beyond this the book was dryer than normal and very wordy.This year my college switched to Russel's introductory biology book and it seems that it has the same issues. I would avoid if possibleOne good aspect of this book is the introduction to molecular techniques."
5,good purchase,"book was in pretty good shape with an unopened cd. received the product very quickly, and the price was great!"
5,Invaluable for all who seriously explore life to the fullest,"This is one of the best books to learn about reality manipualtion and how to go about exploring the multifaceted ways of personal existence and identity. Jane, Seth and Robert have given all of us invaluable richness and the tools to explore our own realities closely.Compelling reading and working because it is interesting enough to capture the mind and fascinating enough to make imagination work in a guided way."
5,Fantastic Book!,For anyone who reads Jane Roberts Seth books this is a must read!! I cannot say enough about this book!!
5,Just brilliant,"This album is nothing less then brilliant. Normally you have albums that are very uneaven, but this one hasn't got a singel flaw. So, if you haven't heard it, buy it, download it or borrow it... You can't get dissapointed."
1,If only I could could give this 0 stars!,"This book...indeed this whole pseudo-scientific theory of white intellectual superiority makes the bile rise to my throat. How can you compare the capacity of two racial groups whose experiences couldn't be more disparate. Black people were enslaved in this country for 246 years and received blatantly unequal, legally mandated treatment for 346 years and you actually expect African-Americans to achieve parity on any level in 36 years (Since 1965)? This assertion is ludricrous at best. Not to mention the fact that the IQ tests themselves are subject to the bias of their mainstream creators. Readers, if you want to use this drivel as an excuse to assert racist viewpoints with a clear conscience and WITHOUT one shred of critical analysis about WHY Blacks score lower go right ahead. As for me, I won't even entertain this argument."
1,Absolute Bullsh**,"Ethnicism, elitism at its highest. This is not ""science"" or knowledge. Michael Levin will be pleasantly surprised when he meets his maker. Absolutely unbearable to read."
1,A jew who fights in the same trench of white supremasists,"I'm a jew and,as a jew,I'm deeply ashamed in knowing that a jew (as Mr. Levin obviously is) has written this pseudoscientific stuff in the way of the Bell Curve and the same.Doing this ,he has betrayed all the Holocaust victims and he places his self in the same ideological spectrum of nazis and white supremasists.He should feel at least so perturbed in knowing that his book is quotted (by one of his book reviewers) along with Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf as an example of the 'genuine' knowledge about races. What a dishonor !"
1,Evil...,"Racism by any other name smells the same: like the burning corpses at Auchwitz and the fetid hulls of the slave ships. It is the stench of suffering caused when one human can look at another as someone lesser than him/herself, deserving to live and die in hell on earth. Racism is the final judgement of man, not god, not nature. This book only confirms that it is power that is the root of all evil. There is nothing radical about this hideous tome. It has all been said before, so many times and for so many centuries that I despair of our ability to learn anything from our blood-soaked history. Where have these ideas brought us? Look around. There is war on every continent. Hatred brings only death."
2,"Not worth the $110 I paid, much less the $149 on Amazon.","As the previous reviewer stated, the sound coming from this ""boombox"" is not very good. I didn't expect Bose quality, but when you plop down 110 bones, you can get far more quality from one of those ""ultra-bass"" stereos at Costco at a cost of about $150.The controls, although they looked choice in the pictures I saw before I bought this item, in actuality they are ultra-cheap plastic and very flimsy. I wouldn't be surprised if they were the first items to fail on this thing.I guess the only plus for this thing is the enclosure it sits in. Looks and feels rugged. Waterproof. If the stereo doesn't last, this box may make a good container of some sort.Skip on this Jeep boombox and get a real one with better quality."
5,Great Sound,I've had this system for 5 years now without a problem. The thing I like most is the clear sound and also the cool operating temperature. It gets warm but never hot like amps do. It has a nice design and appearance.
5,A STORY THAT KEEPS YOU GUESSING TO THE VERY END,"GOOD NEIGHBORS IS A STORY THAT CAPTURES THE MOOD AND FEEL OF A QUIET SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD AND WHAT RESULTS WHEN SOMETHING GOES TERRIBLY WRONG. THE CHARACTERS ARE PEOPLE YOU COULD PICK OUT IN YOUR OWN NEIGHBORHOOD. BY SEEING THE STORY THROUGH THE MAIN CHARACTER, JUKE MILLER, YOU GET TO DISCOVER WHAT STRENGTHS DRIVE HIM AS A FORMER COP AND WHAT WEAKNESSES NAG HIM AS A MAN. THE STORY TAKES MANY TWISTS AND TURNS AND MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR ON A NARROW AND WINDING ROAD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WONDERING WHAT'S AROUND THE NEXT CORNER! A ""MUST READ"" FOR THE STRONG OF HEART."
3,A Good Read,"I strongly recommend The Concubine's Daughter to all interested in Hong Kong and its history, and indeed to all who are interested in ""a good read"". The novel traces the life of the central character, Elizabeth Lee, a raving beauty, from the time she first enters the then only university in Hong Kong. She studies English literature and excels in the subject to the extent that she manages to overcome colonial prejudices to become a teacher in the English Department. She attracts many admirers, one of whom is an intense billionaire tycoon. She refuses him to marry a doctor. She and her husband flee Hong Kong after the 1967 riots and emigrate to Boston, where Elizabeth feels useless and marginalized. The book ends with a return to Hong Kong and the promise of a new life. The author clearly feels a strong affinity with her protagonist since she depicts her with sympathy and insight."
4,amazing,This salt turns water into a milk feeling and your skin into a cream. Absolutely amazing! I am into bathing salts and this one by far the best one and wouldn't wish for any better. I am happy to find such an amazing product.
3,"Good Bath Salt, Bad Value","As far as bath salts go, these add a good scent to your otherwise vapid bathing experience. The lavender scent can be best described as laundry detergent smell. However, the scent is not as overbearing and in fact, quite relaxing for lack of better word. I have bathed in these for 20 minutes and enjoyed the experience as they made my skin soft, at least during the time I was in the bathtub.In terms of value, I would advise you to seek out other brands or scents if you can find some that are cheaper. They ask you to use 1-2 cups per bath, and honestly, you can go through the whole 64 ounces pretty quickly. These are simply scented salts and they shouldn't cost thirty dollars. So if you can heed my advice, go for a cheaper alternative.However, if you can afford it, I would say go ahead and buy these bath salts. Lot of people seem to have good experience with them, and I am not going to disagree.Happy bathing fellow halophiles!"
1,DOESNT WORK AS ADVERTISED,"I wish I could give this 0 stars. I bought these for a huge party I was having. I had about 20 kids over and we divided this into 3 ounce portions. We took turns smoking, injecting, and eating this. It tasted like SOAP! It didn't get us high at all. I thought this was going to be fun. To top it all off, it gave me diarrhea and a stomach ache and now everyone makes fun of me at school."
3,Not bad but was expecting more,"I got this on a bit of a whim since I am trying to find ways to relax. These salts do smell great and totally dissolve in your water. They leave your skin nice and soft. So why only 3 stars, to be honest it wasn't that the salts were bad, but just didn't do anything for me. I didn't feel anymore relaxed afterwards, or really any different at all to be honest. The other thing that irritated me a bit is the total cost. Yes you get 64oz of product but you use 16oz per bath so your getting 4 baths out of that huge container."
4,great product and good price.,"Great product and very good price and fast shipping. Im very satisfy with Masada Bath Salts, I would like to make another business again."
5,Masada Lavender Bath Salts,"These bath salts are wonderfully relaxing, contain just the right amount of lavender and are a bargain compared to purchasing them in smaller sizes at other stores. Highly recommend for relaxing and soothing away the day's stresses. Try some."
1,I didn't like it at all,"I usually go with the lavender bath salt from Mistral, but since they were out of stock I figured I'd try this one. What a disappointment. It doesn't smell anything like lavender it just smell salt period. Had to return it. Try Mistral is my advice."
4,Soothing Bath Salts,"This is a wonderful bath salt for when you have a cold or just feel under the weather. A cup or a cup and a half of this in a hot bath, lay back and soak for a half-hour or so, and you'll feel so much better when you get out of the bath. We bought a small jar, which we used in a flash, so we bought the larger size. We love it."
5,Shall we shag now...,"...or shall we shag later? Now if they could figure out how to tee the ball up for me I wouldn't have to bend over at all! But seriously, I find this product to be a vast improvement over the old shag stick that I was using. I haven't used it on real grass though, just on the practice mat and net I have set up in my garage. Given the consistent way the Shag Pro serves 'em up, I think it would also work fine out back."
2,Nice looking but towels slip off,"I bought this to go with the towel bars and faucet that match. It looks very nice, but the towels slip off the ring. I think the design needs to have a little bit more of a curve for your towel to stay on."
4,not a cheap product,LOVE- all the Danze that we bought. Looks great. Functions great. Obviously not a cheap product. Good water flow worth the investment
3,great album,"this album gathers the best of Luis Eduardo Aute.Shows his artistic sensibility, that he build up since his startings as a fine art painter.The good melodys, deep and poetic lyrics and his great voice make the perfect mix to create a classic romantic song.If there is something Aute knows is romance."
5,Excellent cookbook!!,"This is an excellent cookbook - definately worth buying. I am very impressed with the variety of recipes, as well as the simplicity of instructions!! Very valuable resource!!"
4,Pupies Dogs and Blue Northers,"This is a great book. It's about a man who owns a dog kennel. He loves the dogs more than life itself. But, he gets heart disese. He may have to give up the kennel. This is a drama that kept me interested. I don't usually read this type of book, so it had to be very good to interest me. I hope you like it."
4,Paulsen is a talented writer.,Paulsen types his thoughts to create a story to make the reader think about their life.Paulsen uses short and descriptive sentences to create his fantasy life over again.
3,it is ok,"the package was not very good. it arrived ok, but it seems dirty and this has the impresion of used product"
3,Flash MX ActionScript,"In today's current craze for animation and gaming, you might find this book helpful. If you are patient enough and detail oriented to create more online shows, this one is for you. The more skillful you are in computer animation, the more valuable you become. If you are a beginner, you have to give yourself time to absorb the details in this book or you will be frustrated. Take one day at a time to create a major project. Internet nowadays is much better and looks better than ever because of this animated gadgets. It loads faster too than the traditional downloading method before you can see it."
1,Useless,"ActionScript is the key to doing cool stuff with Flash, but the key this book provides doesn't fit the lock. For example, an instruction would say: Click Actions>>Movie Control and then double-click 'goto'. Sounds simple, except there is no Actions>>Movie Control>>goto. I don't understand how an entire book could be published with so much improper information."
5,love them!,These are so adorable I wear them with everything. There don't look cheap at all! I hope they wouldnt for $$54!!
1,Don't waste your money,"I was given this as a gift for Christmas. The inserts for the different Ipods are hard to install and remove, which is a pain if you want to share this with someone who has a different model Ipod than you. The sound quality is poor. Very tinny with no tone controls. The SRS WOW seems to run all the time which makes everything sound like it was recorded in a wash tub. When playing at a louder volume (like you might need to when using it outdoors) the sound is distorted and the Ipod actually rattles in the holder.I suppose if you are going to be playing this at very low volumes, it might be okay, but I will be looking to spend a few more bucks and get a better unit.What really is rotten about this whole genre of products is that you can buy a decent sounding CD boombox for under $50, but you can't seem to do the same for your Ipod."
2,#2 in our failed attempts at iPod Speakers,"Easy enough to use, the docking is simple, easy to move around... from the outside of the box everything seems ideal. A little steep for a pair of speakers, but still half the price of some of its competitors.Then we plugged it in. This box vibrates at moderate volume. For clarification, I'm 33 and can still hear dog whistles and picture tubes, I've taken pretty good care of my ears: ""Moderate"" to me is not very loud.The speakers vibrate the housing in such a way that they generate a buzz through the plastic parts that you usually only hear when the bass is really low or the volume really high.Its a dealbreaker, for 100 dollars you can get a really nice set of speakers for a PC... I don't think it's too much to ask for a decent set of iPod speakers."
2,BUMMED..No power!,"Bought the Memorex Mi3005, for my son.($100) Worked fine for a little while but now, it won't power up- Thought maybe we needed a new power cord?? The green light on the cord lights up, but nothing happens beyond that! After reading other reviews- I realize it's probably a manufacturing ""poor quality"" issue. What a waste! :("
1,Craptaculous!,"Like everyone else said... Worked sporadically at best. Worked not at all at worst. Unless Memorex specifically addresses the quality control problem here, I would not advise buying one. I returned mine."
2,not work for my ipod - wrong adapter,"we bought this at walmart - I have a new ipod nano, with a metal case; after reading a previous post, maybe these are different, but anyway...I can sit it on the dock w/o an adapter, and it works, but there is no support for it, so that wouldn't last long. I called the company to see if there was an adapter, and she said to take it back to the store. I have opted not to bother trying to get a new adapter."
1,Do not buy this product,"We received this product in the mail from Amazon. It was not taken out of the box right away,but when it was it doesnt even work. The tech support is horrendous and its been three weeks for them to respond. when they do its generic emails that have no value in replacing my equipment. this radio is garbage just like their customer service. I just spent 30 minutes on the phone with someone overseas trying to get a replacement under warranty and they wont do that until I go out and buy 8 D batteries to test the radio. bs, dont get this radio."
1,"Defective product,, bad service, BRIBERY!!","I received the boombox and it did not work. At all. Obviously no one tested it before it left their storage area. I packaged it all back up and spent $13 to send it back to their warehouse for a refund. I had to remind them that they received the boombox (tracked USPS) and I needed my refund. They only refunded the cost of the boombox and not the shipping/handling to my house. So I spent about $36 and my time for nothing. I won't use this place again.UPDATE: I received several emails from WSP regarding how they wanted to make this ""right for me"".However, they would not send a refund unless I changed my review to give them a positive rating.I have the emails to prove it.I asked them if they resorted to bribery with all their unhappy customers; never heard back.Terrible place. I reported them to the BBB."
1,JUNK!,What a piece of junk! Can i give it zero stars? The am/fm reception is terrible. the ac/dc power cord is defective. And Memorex is impossible to contact. Don't waste your money on this product.
2,Stopped playing my ipod!,"I ordered this in July to take camping so I could listen to my ipod, and it worked wonderfully! I used it only a couple of times during my camping trip, and then brought it home and took it on my deck to play outside, and it didn't play my ipod! It still charges the ipod, but when playing the songs, no sound comes out! I guess it just stopped working! The radio still plays, and the sound is great, but I bought it to play my ipod and if it doesn't do that then it's worthless to me. Very disappointing that it stopped working after only a couple of times. I've owned this boombox for less than one month, and already have this trouble, and I've taken excellent care of it, so it's nothing I did. Maybe I got a bad one???"
1,WRONG ITEM,"When we received this product we were dismayed to find that it wasn't what it was supposed to be. We got two drivers side motors. Needless to say, we were not pleased."
5,When Country Was Cool!,"This is a great Columbia cd from John Conlee from 1987. This was one of two for Columbia, the other being Harmony in 1986, also excellent. Great songs on this cd with none appearing on any other MCA compilations. Other reviewers noted the charting singles which are great. The others of interest are Slow Passin' Time and American Faces. This cd along with Harmony, Classics and Songs For the Working Man make for a complete John Conlee collection."
4,Great for on the go!,"The Jeep TV/CD/AM/FM Boom Box is great for boating, fishing, camping, etc. Buy a cigarette lighter adapter and it will save you on the battery bill!"
4,Conquer Stress: Staying Sane in an Insane World,"The book appears to be quick and informative and it has some good advice, but it almost makes me stressed out to read it because it is so fast paced. Of course, he tells you to read some of it over and over again to get the procedures down. Dr. Zeidman holds back no punches and he gets down to the nitty-gritty. If you want this book as a self-help book, let me tell you now, don't buy it unless you are ready to change your old habits!"
1,"I'm Cajun, NOT Creole","This book might pass as fiction (if you are willing to suspend all belief). I was born, raised, left and came back to South Louisiana. Creole is half black and half Spanish. Cajuns do not refer to themselves as Creoles, and the Cajuns I know are mostly well off. Puplic Schools, the oil industry, and television have not destroyed us. In my hometown, the morning and evening news (on radio and television) is still broadcasted in Cajun French. The research for this book left a lot to be desired. If you want to know about Cajuns, don't believe what you read in this book. The pronuncations are the only factual parts of the book. I found this book in the file cabinet in a high school library. I only kept reading it out of utter disbelief of the written words. This book gets one star because zero stars wasn't an option."
1,Disappointing,"Christmas celebrated as the birth of Jesus, and Easter's meaning of Jesus' death and resurrection are missing from this book; there is not even a passing mention. It is a beautifully written and illustrated book, but it was very disappointing in what it left out. I think anyone buying this book should know that ahead of time. Depends on what you're looking for."
5,Very Pleased,This item arrived very quickly and was as exactly as described. Would purchase again from this seller!
5,Great way to order new blades,"Amazon site was able to generate options for wiper blades for my particular vehicle. The blades were perfect fit, arrived in a timely fashion and the price was right."
1,don't waste your money...,"These wipers are real junk! I got them because of a mail-in rebate buy 1 get 1 free but even that way they don't cost their money at all. Very inconsistant, don't do the job at all even as a brand new. They leave the winshield blured and you'll be in trouble in a rainy days. I will never buy from this brand again and my advise to you is to do the same..."
4,"Harry Speight's ""Kirkby Overblow"", Yorkshire","Published in 1903, this was one of the shorter of Speight's books. Initially starting its life as part of his gigantic ""Lower Wharfedale,"" the text had to be annexed because of the cost of producing so large a book at the time. The following year this 172-page work saw the light of day.It follows in the writer's established literary path: detailing his own explorations (on foot) of all the old paths, rivulets, hamlets, rocky outcrops and archaeological sites a few miles around Kirkby Overblow, as well as in the town itself. Each thing he looks at is described with intimate care, detailing the history, geneaology, folklore and old customs of all things. Quite simply - if you're wanting to get a good book on the history and legends of this small region in Yorkshire, you can't go wrong with this!"
5,good movie,"This is my favorite version of d'Artanian and Three Musketeers. Kind and funny, with a rush of exitement. Have seen this movie like a thouthand times and it never gets old.Great movie, if you speek Russian. :-)"
4,some good ska,"the ernies are a great band from richmond va. this cd is like stait ska wth maybe a little bit of rock and funk. i like it alot and recomend it to any ska fan. also, they have 2 other cds coming out. one, dropping science which is like ska, funk,rock, and rad, they call it jive. then on april 20th the newest cd is relised, which is realy hard and you cant even tell the that they are the saem band, so check them out"
4,Sweet little book,"Sweet and simple. I would have liked slightly more polished illustrations, but it is a unique concept and it works."
1,Collection needs to be complete,uhhhmmm...this is not a toy...if i gave it to my 3 year old cousin to play with someone would get hurt...they are collectable figurines that sit on a shelf...
4,Good Coffee with No Frills,"If you are a coffee drinker needing no bells and whistles, this machine is for you. I don't ask much from a $20 coffee pot except a decent cup of coffee. This Mr. Coffee delivers, and its design is a step up from our previous Mr. Coffee, which was also their cheapest model. It would be nice if the company worked on a carafe that pours without spilling though. I have never purchased any Mr. Coffee machines, cheap or expensive, that poured well. Having owned other brands, I know it's not the person pouring. Other than that, no problems."
3,Short life is not unique!,"We've had the 12-cup Mr Coffee (simple style) for less than a year. The warming plate just quit warming, so we're in the market for another maker.At this point, we'll go with another one of these $20+ models, since our experience with more expensive models of different brands shows that no manufacturer seems to get much longevity from drip makers."
1,piece of junk,"I used product for less than two months, stopped working. I consider this a piece of junk, entered the trash can hall of fame."
1,doesn't close,"They are all stuck, unless I'm missing something, but I wouldn't know because they do not come with instructions. You can't find any information online, either."
2,So so.....,been using the product for 6 months now - battery time isnt great - I constantly need to recharge the battery. People always complain of an echo.
2,Not a good product,"I bought this product for my husband for christmas because he talks on the phone a lot with work. The instructions say 8 hours of talk time. However, it only has 3 hours of talk time before it needs to be recharged. So, its a good product if you don't need more than 3 hours of talk time. But, bad if you need it all day."
1,Lousy Customer Service for broken CS10,"I purchased 2 CS10 cordless headset units for my customer service center. 1 quickly became defective and needed to be replaced. After using the ""Quick Fax"" service, (you return the defective item and they ship you a replacement) and practically begging to receive the replacement ASAP, a week has rolled by and still no replacement. I called ""customer service"" and spoke to Andrea, who was cold, impersonal and not knowledgable in her responses to my questions. She explained that ""we don't use overnight service."" I mean, you must be kidding! When I asked her for someone who could track my items, she put me on hold, came back, asked me if I'd mind waiting in another queue, so I said ok. I was then transferred to an unidentified mailbox to leave a message. I wonder if any one will ever call me back. Somehow I doubt it. I would have given 0 stars if possible."
2,Look for alternatives at a much lower price,I loved this Cordless headset until I found another that was under fifty bucks which was just as good. (R*dio S***k)
2,Headset volume a problem,"I found that the headset volume for this phone was low, even when I adjusted the volume all the way up. Perhaps I could buy a better headset to fix this problem. But why should I have to?"
1,Save your money!,"Heavy, Short Battery Life, Rechargeable Batteries last a couple of months then need replacing. I do not recommend this product."
3,"Good product, why so high priced?","I got this product but ended up sending it back and getting the CT10. It's a very good product but my question is: why do they charge twice as much for a system that seems to have the same functionality as the CT10, except that it can't operate as a phone? The CT10 is everything the CS10 is except that you get a complete phone that allows you to dial from the mobile pad and such (much better for voicemail and other things that require automated menus). I just don't get it."
5,plantronics rocks!,"I can't say enough good things about Plantronics. Have 2 CS10's. One from Amazon and one from elsewhere. When A small plastic tab that holds the battery in place broke I was sure I was going to have to purchase another unit, or pay to have it repaired. A call to plantronics revealed how customer service should be. Even though the unit was not under warrenty, they shipped me an advance replacement unit free of charge. All that I required was the remote unit and they accidently sent me the whole product. For this 'inconvienience' about a week later I recieved a complementary remote unit. Bravo"
1,"Nice, in theory...keeps breaking","The CS10 is certainly everything a cordless headset should be: small, lightweight and well-designed. However, I'm now on my third unit in as many months, and it, too, just died. Evidently the belt pack and the base station ""forget"" how to communicate with each other over time.Too bad...Plantronics has always been *the* name is business phone accessories, but I'm afraid it's time to go hunting for a replacement."
1,unfortunate and misleading,"I was very excited to have this product. It was exactly what I needed for my small home business--taking notes while chatting with customers, and no neck problems. Unfortunately, my brand new model was defective and didn't work from Day 1. Rather than return the whole thing, I tried to work with Plantronics to receive a replacement for a defective part, and that has not gone well at all. They sent a replacement for the part that works. They neglected to include the part that is defective. I am sorry for this state of affairs, because at a previous employer I had a Plantronics set that worked well. But now I have spent a ridiculous amount of time and energy to get this solved, and it seems the only option left if a complete return."
1,caution - zero rating,"Don't buy this belt for a villager, the engine is a non-interference engine, this will not fit"
2,"international Relations Theory:Realism, Pluralism Globalism, and Beyond",This book was not well kept like many other I have purchased before. I feel it was not worth the price offered.
4,Just the right temp,"Set the temp and the house will stay that way. No complicated timers and programming. A little difficulty with wiring as my wires were not colored as the installation guide instructed. Found online advice through a google search, and I was good to go. Whole process took less than 20 minutes total once I was advised on proper wiring."
1,Failed,"This unit was installed as a replacement when I purchased a new AC/furnace. That was 2.5 years ago and now it has failed. The thermostat refuses to read the indoor temperature. Calling Honeywell support, they confirmed that it was a defective unit and under warranty. But because I didn't buy it, they couldn't send a replacement. I have to call the furnace guy, take off work, and pay him to swap it out. I think I'll just get a non-Honeywell brand from the hardware store instead of dealing with the run-around."
3,"Okay, sizing is on the small side","I needed a natural colored tank and this seemed to fit the bill and the price is great. But..... the XL I got is more like a L. I have lost almost 100 lbs and most other XL tops fit me. This one is snug but eventually I'll fit it as I lose more weight. Just wish I had ordered the XXL. I would get this, just order a size up."
3,Worked Well for 2.5 Years,"This battery has served us well for approximately 2.5 years, but now does not hold a charge. After a full charge, the battery meter in the camera shows full, but it only lasts for 40-50 shots, using external SB400 flash."
1,Nice price - didn't last long,I would not buy this battery again. The price is affordable but only if it keep it's charge as long as the Nikon battery.
2,Two dollars worth,"I did NOT receive a ""high capacity"" battery! I got a standard 1000mAh battery. I should have known better for a 2 dollar price."
3,Improper Listing-Not a Nikon Battery,"This battery is OK, no problems. However, I think Amazon should enforce truth in listing. This is not a Nikon ENEL battery. It is not a Nikon product, but the listing says it is a ""Nikon D40 Replacement Battery EN-EL9."" I'm happy with the battery but not the listing."
1,Low capacity instead of high capacity? Yes.,"As one of the other reviewers, I did NOT receive this high capacity battery! I got a standard 1100mAh battery... DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS STORE!"
5,America: A Nation of free givers,This product was received in good time and condition. It's clarion call for us to remember the less privileged. Everyone ought to have this product.
1,It really looks cheappy,Got the product today. Parts are loose inside the box. Some shining metal parts has no plastic bag to protect. One handle got damaged. Scratches and scratches.... Is this used or refurbished?Don't even mention the user manual.Don't even mention the service email. They blocked you because they want to block spam. What a hell.I will return it to the store right away. Worse than the chinese tools in harbor freight.
4,A challenging book,"I agree with Peter J.Stan's beautiful review.The book is inspiring and challenging.I want to point out to the readers an error in the proof of SCHOLIUM 2.1 in SECTION 2.3 INTEGRALS OF STEP FUNCTIONS of the book.In the proof it was stated that ""the largest set on which f+g assumes this value is a finite union of certain of the....and is thus again a set in R"".This is not correct.The largest set on which f+g assumes any one of the values that f assumes on one of the Es is not a union of the sets of the form stated in the proof.The keys in my keyboard are not adequate to precisely specify this error.I want to get this error corrected in the next edition of the book but I don't know to whom I have to communicate.I can be contacted thro' email in this regard by any friend who can advise me as to how I can get this error corrected.[...]C.Ramabrahmam"
4,The Tell-Tale Heart,"Ive read this book in one of my classes at school. I would suggest it to anyone that has a wider vocabulary. Basically its about a man, the narrator, who has an obsession with another man's eye. The eye resembles that of a vulture's or in simpler terms it has a glazed look to it. The eye drives the narrator crazy. After many nights of waiting he finally gets the chance to kill him. He hides the body underneath the floorboards in the house. When the police investigate the narrator believes that he can hear the beating of the heart underneath the floor. He is sure the police can hear it to. It ocercomes him, and since he is so sure that they hear it, he confesses. When in all reality, it is his own guilt which leads him to confess... But thats a reader's digest version. :)"
5,Crazy But Love,"Oh my favorite writer is Edgar Allan Poe and this story is awesome. Must read cause the entire time you are thinking that the eyeball is bothering you too. What a awesome story, dark but a must read for classic horror fans!"
4,The Tell Tale Heart,"My favorite story by Edgar Allan Poe is The Tell Tale Heart, this is my favorite story because it is a very suspensful, and you never know whats going to happen next. In the story the man's eye is aggervating him and he decideds to kill him. After the man kills him he goes crazy and has deep gulit so he confesses."
2,Edgar Allan Poe,This book of short stories and poems by Edgar Allan poe is very confusing. I would only suggest this book to an adult of teenager with an extremely wide vocabulary. I'm in middle school and I didn't really undrestand some of the stories. If you are into bazzar and weird things then this is the book for you. don't get me wrong Edgar Allan Poe is an awsome writer but the book is a little confusing. Be sure to make the right choice on this book.
3,so-so,"I really liked these earrings, however the pendulum in the middle kept getting stuck on things. I wish they would have made it stationary."
2,Motor too weak,"Great design and blade guides, but the motor is too weak. It needs at least 1/2 hp not the 1/3 hp that it comes with. It does NOT have a 1 hp motor as indicated on the web site!"
2,Damaged in shipping: Twice,"The first unit they sent had a damaged On/Off switch and was missing parts. The second unit had all the parts, but once again the On/Off switch was broken, including the plate that covers the switch. It's not really the manufacturer's fault because both units appear to have been damaged in shipping. So, if you see this in hardware shop, go for it, but don't buy online."
5,built like a saw should be,"It has a 1hp peak motor according to Mfr. Saw has plenty of power and Amazon has free shipping so it was a better deal than the sears model. It was the only model I found in the 10"" CATEGROY WITH 3 BEARINGS FOR GUIDENCE? All other used one or none! easy to set-up and cuts like a dream. Would recommend this one."
1,My poor little Satan still injured himself. :(,"I read this book cover to cover hoping to get great tips to Satan-proof my home- you know, keep him from starting fires, getting into the cabinets where dangerous power tools live, keep him from drowning in the pool. What a waste a money, it didn't cover any of those things. If someone knows a better book to keep my precious little Satan safe around the home, please contact me in the comments."
5,SUPER CRUE FAN,"EL CONCIERTO DE MOTLEY ESTA BRUTAL Y LOS OTROS GRUPOS TAMBIEN , SONIDO , VISUALES SUPER , SIXX AM ESTA SUPERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.."
1,Very disappointing,"Will I buy it? Probably not. The show was ok, but if there's one thing that irks me, it's how Vince leaves off the first word of each line? It's more or less just yelling out the words rather than actually SINGING them. When concert tickets cost $125 for a decent seat (and they were $11 the first time I saw the Crue in 1983), I expect a better show.Word of warning. If you're buying this to show your kids what their old man listened to 20 years ago (and maybe still today), do NOT let them listen to the Buckcherry song ""Crazy B*tch"". He was disgustingly vulgar in that song and I was embarrassed for my friend that brought his TEENAGE kids to the movie. I expected a few cuss words, but good lord he went a bit too far with the graphic sexual references."
3,Undecided,"Still debating if the DVD was worth the price.The pros: Great Bands! Great musicians - especially Mick Mars guitar workThe cons: * Vince's singing - Brutal, when he wasn't yelling in the mic he sounded whiny and not hitting half the notes. The whole time I'm thinking the lead singer from SIXX AM can replace Vince ANYTIME please.(cons con't) * I know it's called Crue Fest but would it kill to give the supporting bands some cool lighting and pyro too? Buckcherry got some lighting but damn Papa Roach and SIXX AM got very little. TRAPT got NOTHING, and just 2 or three songs from each band? All designed to make Motley look that much better but they're screwing the consumer.So is the price worth the DVD? Refer back to the title of review."
1,"It's sad, but it's true....","As other reviewers mention, Vince's performance is bad enough to kill the biggest fan's desire to own this DVD.I've seen over 400 concerts. Vince takes the cake for worst frontman performance I've ever seen with this one.It's really a shame, because the rest of the band is still firing on all cylinders, even Mick after years of health concerns.But when Vince takes to the mic, you'll want your money back. It's ridiculous.I challenge you to make it past ""Las Vegas, Nevada... Long gone is the wishing well."" on Wild Side.You'll really only catch the line because you knew it before watching the video...I'd have to pull up the lyrics to tell you what he says before that it's so unintelligible.And that's an example of when he sings... As others mention, he skips over so many lyrics, this is only half the problem.The moral of the story:Vince owes it to his fans and bandmates to do better than this."
5,Crue Fest 2008,"This is a must for the crueheads!! Not only I was pleasantly surprised to see that the newer bands sound awesome but Motley Crue still rules!! The boys are still living in the wild side,kicking butt and having a great time,very good piece of work."
2,Bad Editing!,"When I attended Cruefest (twice, by the by), I was completely blown away by the production value: lights, pyro, projections, you name it. This DVD however, is edited so that these things are either not showcased properly, or completely changed. Everything looks like it's in a red haze, which was not the case live.I also thought some of the camera choices were questionable. I was excited at the performance to see so many times that Vince, Nikki, and Mick would line up in front and rock out together, and you barely see that on the DVD. Too many shots are close ups when they should be long shots, and vice versa.Also, the sound is pretty terrible. There is some crowd noise, but I thought it was silly that when Vince would let the audience sing the choruses in many songs, all you heard was silence...All in all, I would say to save your $20 to go towards your beer tab at Cruefest 2009"
2,Terrible video editing,"I find this DVD to be unwatchable. The video editing (like most live concert DVDs these days) was done in a way that the camera angle changes every couple of seconds (or quicker). It gives me a giant headache to watch this DVD. When are the producers of these concert videos going to learn that most people prefer concert videos that make you feel like you're actually at a concert, and not just watching some slickly produced MTV video? The quick camera changes, cheezy slo-mo effects, and all of the red lighting throughout the concert make for a terrible viewing experience. That being said, the audio is pretty cool. It's always fun watching and listening to Tommy play the drums. Just wish this video was better edited. I actually like the Lewd Crued and Tattooed DVD better than this one (even though Tommy isn't playing drums)."
3,Not Bad For The Price!,"This mask does offer you more bang for your buck, at this price point. I would definitely recommend it, but don't expect too much!"
4,Sparking imaginations,"This book is my five-year old son's favorite! The illustrations are striking and the short text descriptions trigger elaborate conversations. We discuss which of these medival beasts is the strongest, the meanest, the most difficult to capture. The author includes a table of pronouncations, which my son uses to correct me. We spend hours pouring over the map on the inside cover, locating different beasts and thinking about where they came from. My older son and his friends use the illustrations as guides for their own drawings, which now grace the walls of our house.Its a rare book that can spark so many imaginations while teaching the alphabet, word origins, geography, and history. The Bestiary is just such a book!"
1,"""A Review of the Above Review""",The rewiew of the VTech VT-040-9111 by Jefferey Tam was completely useless and should not have been printed.
5,Excellent introduction to Skullflower,"As the title of the album might suggest, this is the recommended entry-point. Not as crazed as 'Carved in Roses' nor as expensive as some of their import releases, This is Skullflower is a full length tapestry of drone-clutter (my new term for the sound Skullflower makes), mixing relatively common place instrumentation in dense, avant-garde jazz like fashion, yet not being jazz. 'This is' creates a tremendous noise without being noise just for noise's sake. This is really quite beautiful and abstract music just as noteworthy as bigger names like AMM, Spontaneous Music Ensemble and the likes. Perhaps in years to come someone will recognize the magnitude of what's been accomplished here."
3,Thoughtful ideas on a variety of subjects.,"I am familiar with Mr. Morrison's work as an actor, director and playright. I enjoyed his first foray into the medium of poetry and prose very much. Poetry is, probably more than any other type of work, intensely personal and subjective. Those reading it must remember that they are looking through a window into the thoughts, and possibly the very soul, of the author. While I can't say I understood each and every poem in this collection, they all made me think. Those dealing with personal relationships, with love, with being a parent evoked the most response as they are universal concepts with which we can all identify. I look forward to Mr. Morrison's next project with enthusiasm."
1,Avoid this phone! Very cheap!,"This was ordered for my home office due to having a speaker phone and several good reviews I read. After receiving it , it wouldn't work and was made very cheap. This is a very cheap product and made in china with thin plastic. It reminds me of a kid's toy phone..actually a kid's toy phone is made better! Look for another phone if you want to actually talk on a phone. Bad product...."
2,two stars,"It used to be that corded telephones were more inexpensive than cordless ones. Not anymore. This one is okay, but it doesn't hang up when you put the handset back on the cradle. Soon, you hear a loud busy signal and ""if you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again."" If there's a trick, I haven't figured it out yet. But for the price, the phone is okay. If you have a home office, I would recommend spending a bit more and getting something better."
2,Microphone issues,"I was pretty pleased initially the the price, features, and phone quality. Everything matched my expectations when it arrived except for the speakerphone microphone. I have to believe it was faulty because it would not work unless you placed your mouth less than a foot away from it and spoke loudly. It didn't fade as you got further away, it just stopped working. I returned the phone and switched to a unit that had wireless handsets to compliment the corded base. Amazon was great on the return and it remains one of my favorite on-line vendors."
3,How did they miss this obvious feature?,"I bought this phone because it's one of the few desk phones on the market that (a) has a headset jack (b) does not plug into wall power. The later is important because there is a lot of electrical interference in my house and other phones (with AC power) had too much static on the line.Overall I like this phone. The call quality is great. But I am amazed by this phone lack of a ""message waiting"" indicator. There is a red LED in the top right corner of the phone, but that's just a ""ring indicator"", which is useless to me because the ring is itself an indicator. (I suppose the ""ring indicator"" light is useful for the hearing impaired.Anyway... if this phone has a flashing light that indicated ""messages are waiting"" I would have rated this a 5-star product."
3,Adequate Desk Phone,"Nice Features:Caller-ID Display and MemoryVolume ControlOk Speaker PhoneLarge keypadCaveats:Will function as a conventional phone without batteries, but if you want the caller ID function, etc., you will need to feed the phone batteries.The keypad is a little awkward. If you don't press the keys directly in the center, they tend to bind with the plastic case."
3,"Not bad, but could be better","All works as advertised, but LCD is not backlit and is exceptionally difficult to read under any conditions other than perfect. Probably a deal-breaker if I'd known about this problem."
2,batteries expire quickly,"Phone runs on 3 AA batteries that are supposed to last about 6 months, according to the instruction manual. I've had the phone a couple months. The batteries have to be replaced every 2 weeks. I use alkaline batteries as suggested."
3,Eats Batteries,I love everything about this phone except its hunger for batteries. It takes three AA batteries and I have tried multiple brands of alkaline batts but I can't get them to last much more than a month.
2,LED does not light up,I was totally disappointed with this telephone as the LED panel does not light up. I was led to believe that it would but you cannot read the caller ID or any number you enter.I sent it back for a full refund. They were prompt in issuing credit to my account but I need to see what I'm doing. What good is caller ID if you can't read it?
1,Never great; now the answering machine is shot,I'm back on Amazon shopping for a new phone/answering machine and when I saw this listing I decided to a write a quick review. I've had this phone for a year or so. It is not nearly as good as other panasonic phones I've owned in the past. The sound is only so-so and the answering machine has never been very clear. A few months ago it stopped playing any outgoing message but the prerecorded default. Now it bounces an echo back at anyone trying to leave a message. It is headed for the trash.
2,Something of a Disappointment; Not Too Horrifying,"Perhaps I would have appreciated ""The Shroud"" (1983) more had I known it was more mystery than horror. Even then, however, the novel's protagonists are less than sympathetic: Jamie, a young priest, is flat, and Maureen, a nubile female of the Irish persuasion, is annoying. Perhaps even more unforgivable is author Coyne's obvious anti-Catholic bent; his trendy, liberal dismissal of religion hampers what could have been a more profound story."
1,Please don't further fuel these people's narcissism,"You know, my grandmother always taught me that wealth and success were blessings to be appreciated and contemplated in private, and to be grateful for because they are distributed unequally and can disappear at any time. I have to wonder what these people's families taught them, besides the lie that money makes you important and you have this wealth because you are somehow just better than other people. The vulgarity and transparent social ambition of the participants in this book just make the whole exercise in narcissism that much more lame. The bad design, bad attitudes, bad values, and ignorance on display here show a real waste of the doubtless costly education lavished on these children of vanity and greed. They would be pitiable if they weren't so arrogant.And their apartments are mostly just really ugly."
1,ha! I know most of these people and...,"My husband and I know most of these people from college and the New York party circuit and let me tell you this book is a joke! If you think that these women really have ""careers"" or grace and style of their own then we have a bridge in this town which you might be interested in purchasing to go along with your copy of this book...Brooke is preying on their vanities and insecurities in order to boost her profile-although from the quality of her writing you can tell that she is not much more intelligent than the BYT's. Her subjects are fun people however to admire them would be not only inappropriate but foolish-let's just say I laughed so hard, this book should listed under ""humour""."
1,overrated narcissists,"The people featured within these wasted pages are overprivileged, self-absorbed trustafundians or super-climbers (like Ocampo herself) getting glory for doing nothing of any real value for society. Pity trees had to fall to provide paper on which to print this vapid nonsense!! Just glad I didn't buy it (was an ill-guided gift).The writing is inferior to that of a 5th grader in public school, no more!! One would think O'Campo could have hired a decent ghost writer to do it for her!"
1,Perhaps the most Disgusting Book I've ever seen.,"Absolutely disgusting. The people in the book are creepy, self-absorbed, and worthless. DeCampo finds some odd things to glamorous as well-- such as the ashtry crammed with at least 100 cigarette butts is presented as if this is a symbol of style, elegance,and artistry. Including Moby is a joke-- as if he's the token artiste among the crowd. It only makes his pretentiousness more pronounced. The Lauder girls-- oh please. Bright young things? All these people should try getting by without a trust fund. You can't help but find this book repulsive."
1,Please tell me this isnt still being printed,"Every time a book like this is printed - a poorly edited mostly worthless homage to a sector of social vampires like the trust fund babies of new york, God sheds a tear.Every time someone actually pays money for one, he mercilessly strangles a puppy."
3,It's a Guilty Pleasure,"Nothing more. The photos are pretty good, the people are somewhat interesting, the text is readable but mostly trite. The fact that this newish, hard-cover book is already 50% off says it all."
4,Jazz for Christmas,This is only my 2nd jazz Christmas CD as I'm slowly developing a taste for jazz music in general. I love almost all Christmas music and this CD is very good. It is a nice mix of artists and there various styles of music on this compilation cd which exceded my expectations. I'm looking forward to listening to this more when the holidays come around. Enjoy!
2,Ok for the price,Favorite song is the one by Will Downing. All in all it is ok for the price and not a bad addition to my Christmas Music collection.
2,My How GRP Has Fallen!,"I have all three GRP Christmas Collections and like them very much. This GRP Christmas anthology is rather lame due to the crappy sounding programmed percussion. I have other CDs by six of the artists on this CD, but none of it sounds as bad as this. Jochem van der Saag is credited with ""programming"" and ""sound design"". I hope I never buy any music with his ""talents"" again. If you do not care about the sound of the backing ""instruments"", then I suppose it could be quite enjoyable, but I will most likely never play if again."
4,Jazzy Christmas,Enjoyed this CD because it's a bit different than the standard Christmas music. Easy listening.
2,The color and design are not the one I asked for,"Hi. Some weeks ago, a friend of myne brought me from the US the chalk bag I purchased in Amazon and sent to his address. I ordered online the cute blue flowers alike design, but the one that came is the red flames which is not bad but definetely I liked the other one better. I live in Caracas-Venezuela and don't know if there is a way to send the item back through a local distributor or to have it changed to the one that I originally wanted. Please let me know what we can do about this, the item is totally new, I just came from a trip and haven't had the chance to use it and also wanted to ask Amazon if there was a chance to do the exchange. Regards, Aya Bracho."
1,Poor Customer Support,"Very poor customer support. Won't add courses per their advertisement.""Add and Use Courses For FREE!)"" <---Don't believe this falsehood. Bought this software and the site/software owners were NOT there from May 21st thru June 7th to support their business. Peak golf time of the year. Very poor. If you are looking at a GPS based distance range finder look else where. Try iGolf or SkyCaddie. Much better bang for the buck."
1,I would like to give this book zero stars,"I am a public policy scholar, not a psychologist, so I cannot address the merits of this book from a clinical psychology perspective. However, it does very little to shed light in any meaningful or comprehensive way on the true problems and issues surrounding prostitution and trafficking. The articles support the editor's misognystic views on women in general and sex workers in particular. Melissa Farley clearly hates the women she pretends to want to help. Not convinced? See the ""sarcastic"" list of reasons she wrote on why a woman may have chosen (or was forced) to become a sex worker at: (...)This book reflects the same bigoted and unhelpful views of its editor and does little to promote understanding or solutions to what is indeed a dire problem."
5,PRESTRESSED CONCRETE HANDBOOK,This arrived when expected and in excellent condition.It is one of the best reference books I have ever invested in. I heartily recommend it to anyone who needs this sort of information.
5,Finally a book for everyone!,"I looked everywhere for a pregnancy journal that both my partner and I liked. This one is great! It lets you replace the page about the ""father"" with a page about your ""partner"". Isn't that cool? It feels nice, it looks nice. Well worth the price!"
4,"cards, cards, cards",I was more than satisfied with the assortment of cards. I pulled several rookies including Donruss Ken Griffey Jr. . I will order from this seller again.
1,awful,"all unopened, what a joke. if you want searched packs w doubles actually in the same pack, this is your company. shame on you, you liars"
1,Poor knockoff of the Mon A Q classic,"This version just doesn't have the emotion of the Mon A Q original. It also lacks many of the lyrics found in the original. Basically, don't waste your money."
1,REDICULOUS...,"This is a rediculous price for a DVD... I agree, no one in their right mind would pay this much for this movie.. What ever happened to $20 for a DVD??.. I was going to purchase this for my aunt for her birthday, but FORGET that!"
1,Dogs In Space,"Sadly this Dvd is of such poor quality it looks like a copy of a copy of a copy taken from a very old video. The colour is all washed out, faces are so blurry that it is impossible to see them, the sound is poor. The only reason that i havent returned it and asked for my money back is that i am not prepared to waste my time on it!"
5,worth the wait,"I've heard about this movie for a long time. Never thought I would get the chance to see it. I finally broke down and bought a player for PAL format.The movie has a ""down under"" production quality that you won't find in the states. I thought I was watching a documentary for a moment. I bought this because I'm a huge Michael Hutchence fan. In that regard, I was not disappointed. If you're not a big fan of Hutch, you may not appreciate thiswindow on Michaels world back in the late 70's. I loved it, and will watch itagain and again."
4,works as advertised,a little complicated but will get the camera in position as desired...slight bumps to the equipment causes the camera to become slightly misaligned with the eye-piece and must be carefully monitored
3,Not universal but build feels good.,"I would recommend testing your camera and scope combo before buying this or any rig. Tried with a cheaper spotting scope and the eye relief was too short to use with any camera I tried. Build quality was decent however some of the locking screws felt weak. The adjustablility was great however do to the long length of the linkage from the camera to the scope, vibration was an issue."
2,Too cumbersome,I returned this item- too much futzing to get it set up. Decided the wildlife would be gone by the time I got everything into place. Will opt for a SLR with a telephoto lens.Could not get good alignment with my Panasonic Lumix.
5,fantastic,This book is a must for anyone who reads and studies Confederate Civil War History. I have been looking for a book such as this for a long time. It's a great reference.
4,For training proposal is very nice,"It is not fast tire but very robust against puncture, saving a lot of time and avoiding to disturbe my workout. Also the durability is very good, 4000 Km on my last IM training w/o puncture. For races, forget, look for continental GP 4000(good balance between price and performance)."
5,"Good tire, hard to install...","The Maxxis Fuse tires that came with my bike (Cannondale Synapse 5) were ready to be retired. Figured I'd replace them with the same thing, but apparently this is the newer version of that tire. I've changed flats before, but never installed a new tire. Wow, these things were hard as hell to put on on. Are all new tires like that?! I about rubbed my hands raw forcing these suckers on the rim. I have tire levers but don't like to use them. Ended up breaking them trying to work these on the rim, finished by hand.100 miles in, no complaints!"
2,Came off my rims.,"Perhaps I received a defective unit, but the tire was a bit difficult to get seated on the rim. I did manage after a while and it stayed on when pumped up to the recommended pressure. When I took it for a ride the next day, the tire popped off the rim about 3 minutes into the ride. The explosion was loud enough to scare several pedestrians. I've never had this issue any other tires I've used with this rim (Gatorskins, Serfas Seca, Gommitalia Calypso)."
1,STAY AWAY,They sent me tires that were rotted. Unbelievable!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Stay as far away from this seller as possible. They almost killed me whern I han acatostrophic flat.........
4,Great Tire,"Thought this tire would be a little rough, but it isn't. It's also very tough. I have over 1,000 miles on the tires and had one flat today (a large construction staple stuck in the tire). I've ridden over glass (accidentally of course), sharp metal objects in the street, sharp stones, and more (typical road debrit) and didn't get a flat from any of those. It's a great tire and I'll keep on buying them."
3,OK but not what I thought it would be,"Using the 700x23 tires on a variety of roads. I'm 5-8 and 165 lbs. At first they seemed indestructible. They handled well initially but had a lot of rolling resistance and I definitely felt slower. Now after 1500 miles in 10 weeks the tires have small punctures and tears. There is less resistance now but they don't handle as well. The rear tire is starting to have a square shape to it as the tread has worn quite a bit. I have not had any flats but am running puncture resistant tubes as insurance here on the thorny desert roads of AZ. Otherwise, I am sure I would have changed at least a few tubes by now. I expected more out of these and will continue to look for a good everyday use tire."
3,only MOSTLY bulletproof,"I am happy to hear these tires can handle the incidental glass shards, sharp rocks, and various road debris because New Mexico goat-heads are tearing the heck out of the set that came with my bike. In less than 1000 miles, I have had three flats that were definitely from little, tiny, bad-*** stickers! These tires do slide on and off without difficulty, and I have had NO problems with pinch-flats, even on the cute little board bridges that go over NOTHING every quarter mile on some of our bike trails. I also run tire liners and thorn-resistant tubes, BTW, so I don't get the puncture problem (and yes, I inspect and clean the inner and outer surface of the tire at every change - it's been about a month between flats). Not a bad tire, though, and it rides well. NOTE: I am now in Albuquerque but haven't changed my review profile yet (hence, the goat-heads!)."
2,"Junk typewriter, buy something different",I bought this to use for the bar exam and it has been nothing but trouble. The daisy wheel breaks after typing less than 10 pages and the warranty doesn't cover the daisy wheel. Brother's customer service is pretty weak too. I've been observing a bunch of other folks using this or very similar brother typewriters and the problems with the daisy wheel seem pretty consistent. I'm pretty unhappy with this purchase considering I've typed less than 50 pages on this thing and I've had to replace the typing ribbon and the daisy wheel. It's not a good product.
3,Good Typewriter,I would suggest this to anyone looking for a basic typewriterCons1. Margins are very difcult to set2. Brother support is awful I contacted them to inform that I did not receive a ribbon or US daisy wheel and they wanted me to jump through hoops. In the end it was just easier to go an buy them.
4,An inexpensive typewriter with superior print,"This typewriter produces superior printing, but has a catch. That is, the print ribbon must not be disturbed, prior to or during use. Once the ribbon becomes the slightest bit misaligned, the print will become very dark, and blotchy. The remedy is easy enough: just remove and re-insert the ribbon cartridge. However, the item on which you were typing may be ""corrected"" but the result ""will not be pretty."" Bottom line: quality printing - unless the printing ribbon is disturbed upon entering media."
2,Shipper Promises,"Received the typewriter promptly from Unique Findz. It works fine. This fills the void perfectly when a computer is impractical to do simple typing jobs. After I removed the typewriter from the box, I noticed there was no sales receipt included. Should I have need of repairs within the warranty period, the receipt is necessary. I contacted Unique Findz sales manager and he promised me the receipt and a partial refund for the correction tape that was faulty. It is over a month now and nothing has been received. Sure hope the typewriter stays healthy!"
3,Brother ML-100 typewriter,I do not like it as well as the BrotherSX-23 I had for 10+ years. This one is adequate for what I use it--envelopes and typing checks--things not always convenient to do on the computer.
2,"Came out of box broken and not covered by ""Warranty""",We opened this and went to use it and it would not work. We called Brother to troubleshoot and they said it was the Daisywheel and we needed to buy a new wheel and that it was not a part covered under the warranty even though the machine was brand new and this was first time use. I will be returning this and not buying anohter Brother product if this is the kind of support they offer on thier products. Horrible customer service when we called in the problem.
3,Service,Purchased the typewriter and arrived in 3 days. Removed from the box and tried to use it. Machine was broken in shipement. Called Amazon and arranged for return/replacement. Replacement Typewriter arrived in 48 hours. Pulled from the box and began using it. Have had it for 30 days and there are no issues. It is a little noisy but overall it is perfect for our needs.
4,A decent headset for the money.,"I purchased this headset to use with computer apps like Skype, etc. and it works well. The mic swivels down to talk, or you can swivel it up when you're not. It fits pretty comfortably on your head. The sound is nice and clear, and the cord is of adequate length. It is handy to have on one ear because then you can still hear out of the other one. Overall, a functional, capable headset at a reasonable price, and I am satisfied with the purchase."
2,Not the most durable,"I bought 2 of these for home and work use. Within a month - and I blamed this on my kids - on was broken - the earpiece was snapped off. Now, 7 months later, my other one the microphone part has stopped working mysteriously. So I think although inexpensive, these are worth what you pay and I am now seeking something more durable."
1,Microphone stopped working after a few weeks,"This unit worked fine for a few weeks. I was using it to make phone calls on my Yahoo voice account. Then the mic stopped working. Probably because the mic pivots where it connects to the head unit.There must be some wear and tear that goes on in there that ruins the connection. Having been purchased online for just $13.99, it wasn't worth the trouble to try and return. So I bought another unit made by a different manufacturer from a local retailer. This one also had a mic that pivoted similarly, and this mic also broke after about a week. At least I was able to return it to the retailer, and instead got one that was designed differently. The one I have now is made by GE and is basically a headset that you can use just as a headset, but you can plug the mic into a jack on the headset to use for making phone calls. Or you can plug the mic right into the computer and just use the computer speakers to listen. Sweet."
2,Pc Headset,Misunderstood the type of headset I was buying. Needed a headset to work with both my telephone and my Pc. Works only with Pc.
4,challenging but fun,Lots of fun but a bit challenging since the edges are not straingt. Will buy another of the White Mountain puzzles. Their pieces are great.
1,needs some improvement,"This charger works well, but it never alerts you when the charging is complete. There is only a manual that says how long to charge certain batteries. Great now I need a timer next to my battery charger."
3,"Its light and small, may be damaged if used outside US.","It's light in weight and small in size. Be careful, it will be damaged if used with input more than 120V, esp in Asia."
1,A little dissapointed,"I bought this for my Mom who is in to astrology, she said it was pretty useless to her and that she would have to buy the accompanying softwarethey were promoting which was 2-3 x the cost of this program in order for it to be any use. Unfortunately I bought it at an electronics warehouse and they wouldnt return it because the seal was broken. Dont make the same mistake!"
3,Great but could be better,"I purchased this after moving to Germany with a 2 month old, 4 year old, and 8 year old. With the amount of walking we do I needed a stroller for my 4 year old to ride on when she gets tired. This was one of the better options since most tandem strollers are very awkward to stear with heavier children. My daughter can't ride in this when I have to lift the front of the stroller to get up on the curb. The stroller needs some tape over some of the frame next to where my daughter hops on. The ends of the frame scratched her a few times. Also the stroller is very hard to get in and out of the van. It is quite long when it collapses. The wheels aren't going to survive the cobblestone streets here very long. The seat also slides back and forth and has to be pulled out several times when my daughter gets in and out. This stroller may be better with a few modifications. I am able to use it but wish there was something better."
2,Sit and STand review,"I am a mother of 2 with a 4 year old and a 5 month old and purchased this to give my older one a place to sit when we are at the mall or museum. I have since returned it. First of all if you are on an all day outing, your littlest one will need to sleep which you cannot due since the seat doesn't recline enough. Secondly it was AWFUL to push. It was heavy and bulky and I found myself not wanting to use it. Third for a super delux stroller shouln't it have cup holders, I mean if I am going to lug and push this monstrosity shouldn't it have a place for the water you need after pushing it. All in all I am still looking for something...but I wouldn't waste you money on this one just get a double with those easy wheels and call it a day."
4,Love my stroller,"I purchased this stroller a few weeks ago. I have a 22 month old & a 4 year old & they love it... My 4 year old loves the fact that if she gets tired she can sit or stand in the back. We are going to NY in a couple of weeks and this is why I purchased this stroller because you have to walk everywhere, now I am sure that they will be OK. The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is because it's a little heavier than I expected. Other than that i's great! I higly recommend it. I plan to have another child so I know I will keep this for a while!"
3,OK if your child prefers to stand more than sit,"I was able to get this stroller for free because of the Amazan Award points I had accumulated. If I had to pay for it out of pocket, I would have been a bit disappointed. First, the seat in the back is very uncomfortable for my 3 year old son. It's impossible for him to sit upright with his sister's carseat attached to the front. The seat also slides back making him have to crouch over even more. The storage space on the bottom of the stroller is limited and there is no storage on the handlebar. On the up side, it is much smaller than a double stroller and it's easy to open and close and maneuver. A friend of mine has the Baby Trend model and while it is longer, it has a much more comfortable sitting area in the back and storage space on the handlebar. I would recommend the Baby Trend over this model any day."
4,My Children Love it.,"My wife and I have been very pleased with this stroller but my kids have been even more. I have a 3.5 years old little girl and 1.5 boy. Both seem to love it. My daugther is usually the one jumping in and out of the back seat while my son just seats in the front seat enjoying the ride. Sometimes my daugther likes to be in the front seat, and my son likes to ride on the back seat. Whoever is riding in the back could either seat or choose to stand on. Stroller is easy to control and easy to fold. The only thing I didn't like about it is that is kind of heavy, and bulky."
4,Joovy Caboose,"A little heavier than I thought it would be. Great if you have two kids and the youngest is over 6 months old. With an infant in a car seat, the older child can't sit in the back, they much stand."
3,good stroller hard to store,"this seems to be a well built stroller. easy to put together, easy to fold up but hard to store because you cant stand it up like other strollers. it does seem to be a bit more compact and maneuverable than the two seaters."
5,I wanted to rate this 6 stars!,"I am reading the book Socrates' Way and I am emotionally moved and intellectually charged. I have never met Ronald Gross who has authored this book, but I feel his passion for both humanity and our ability to use critical thinking to help ourselves and others through his pages. I appreciate the uses of illustrations and sharing of insights and stories through this book as that it challenges us to only to think but to live with integrity."
2,Disapointed,I was excited about this book but I'm at the middle of it right now and I dont think I will finish it.Socrates is just an excuse to talk about obvious common sense points of view about everything. It's more another self help book (in the worst sense of this category) using Socrates to market it.Shallow aproach to one of the biggest thinkers of our civilization.
2,overblown connections to Soc,"Socrates would cringe that his name is in the title, and that the author attempts to draw connections to his guru self help style, and the great Greek philosopher. Do not get me wrong, the book is cute and filled with some nice cotton candy insights, but there is no way any devotee of Socrates would recognize this thinkers' profound complexity and revolutionary approach to dialogue in this writer's one dimensional philosophy and intellectulizing."
5,Good Book,"I did not think I would really care for this book, however even though I had to have it for a class I enjoyed reading it. It can make a person think about how they are living their life."
1,Very Disappointing,This book offers no step by step lessons which is to say the least VERY FRUSTRATING when you are learning a new technology. There are bits and pieces throughout this book that are nice to know but are absolutely useless when you cant apply them to a real world scenerio. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.
1,It is very deficient,"I didn't like the author's view, respecting Bolivia, because it doesn't give areal idea about what this country really is, I think this guy had a very bad trip to Bolivia because he speaks in a very bad way about it. I advise to all of you for not to buy this book, it is really trash."
1,Bad quailty,"The ""Me-ow"" letters come off after I hand-wash it twice. After one week, they were all gone. Now (about 2 weeks I used it), the black of one of the eyes and the edge of ears starts to come off. I use this product only once per day and hand wash it once per day as well. It is a cute bowl but with a vey bad quailty."
2,cat dish,"CShipping took awhile , the dish is cute and glased all over but inside the hanging ornament fell off in few days !"
1,Terrible,"This is a very poorly acted, written and directed movie. Zero character development or drama. It seems the movie was made for the action scenes and to display grand extravagant sets with gazillions of extras and splendrous costumes. The actions scenes were quite terrible - haphazard and sloppy. The acting was laughable. The movie is not even half way decent. Every scene just seemed ....... arbitrary."
5,Fantastic movie!,Fantastic movie! Movie clocks in at around 3 hours but the action and story are so tight that you don't even notice the time! WOW!
5,Worth the money to purchase,"I first watched the original theatrical version and had a few questions about the story line. There were times that things just didn't seem right. After reading the reviews, I discovered the extended, 2 part international edition and ordered it right away. I love this movie. I generally do not like ""subtitled"" movies, but this is a first rate production, much like the big US studios produce. All my questions were answered in the longer version. Did you watch the theatrical version and wonder what the heck the pony meant at the end of the movie? Did you wonder why the princess was kneeling in the midst of all the dead soldiers near the end of the movie? Answered.Basically, I have this to say. If you liked the first short version, you will most likely LOVE the extended version. But then, what do I know? I just like good movies."

5,Very Powerful,"This production was one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. Not only was the action, scenery and dialog well done and given great care, it was a ""smart"" movie. I appreciated the historical and cultural references for this time line. More American movies could follow example and produce epic movies such as this and less superficial drama."
5,Amazing movie!,Saw this movie with my wife and instantly placed an order on Amazon to buy it. Arrived perfectly. A must see. Long but well worth the time.
5,Simply the best,"Simply put, I think it's the BEST that John Woo has ever made. Granted I haven't seen ALL that he's made, it is the best in the last 12 years. A great epic!"
3,A bit much.,"I tried to like this movie. I really did.What it turned out to be was essentially a Chinese reading of Braveheart or Alexander Nevsky, on a larger canvas-- a very black-and-white bit of historical legend with a thick coating of epic grandeur. I pretty much wrote off the historical accuracy after it became clear that all of the ""good guy"" leaders were gentle noble souls and champions of the peasantry, as well as unstoppable killing machines who could butcher an entire regiment single-handedly. In the uncut version, things tend to drag a bit. Ten minutes of watching one middle-aged general kill one pikeman after another got a little stale.If you're looking for a big historical epic, this is it-- just don't hope for too much in the way of complex characters or surprise plot twists."
2,MOVIE SHORTENED WAY TOO MUCH,"I guess this video is the shortened version of the film. But even at the supposed full-length version of 5 hours I doubt it adequately sets the viewers up for the historical background leading to this battle. There was not enough background on the country's politics at the same, the different warlords and their relationships. Each general/higher rank characters in the story has a unique story about themselves as well and of course all of that was left out. If you already know the story it's just an OK movie. If you are not familiar with Three Kingdoms I can see where many people would have trouble enjoying the movie."
4,great movie,"Great movie with good action. Feels a bit like a comic book in the second part with the scene transitions, but good nonetheless."
5,Because 3 Hours Wasn't Enough,"If you've seen the ""short"" version of Red Cliff, are a fan of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms (which is the basis for every Dynasty Warriors game, for instance), or just enjoy a wuxia-style film in general, this is the version you want.It's astounding that a film can stretch to this length without dragging, but much of what's present here falls into the realm of incredible group and individual battles. You get some more character development, and some insightful additions to already spectacular scenes."
3,Red Colors,"Red Colors normally mean HD Player, the HD Covers are in red just like the blue ray movies are blue for their cases, if this was not A 2 Part 5 hr Movie I would return it."
3,Did not realize it was all subtitles,"would not have gotten the movie if I had realized it was all subtitles inmovie, so busy reading subtitles could not watch the movie......you shouldmake it more clear it has subtitles and the movie itself is wonderful whenyou have time to tear your eyes away from reading the subtitles to see whatis happening on the screen..."
3,NOT IN ENGLISH -- Chinese audio only,"Great drama. Storyline and actors are well done. Problem is the audio. International Version is only in Mongolian and occasionally in Cantonese. Unless you were raised in Taiwan, you will not understand all of the subtitled translations. The scenes are not described correctly and the play on words is lost in translation. The movie is great, but you have to watch it twice if you want to really get it all. It is a distraction to have to read the subtitles. If the audio was dubbed in English, it would be worth the money, otherwise, you are wasting time having to rewatch the series later. The movie is really long, so it is a waste of time if you miss anything the first time around. I would reccommend the movie, just not the international version, it is not for the English market. Wait until the english audio version is released before purchasing."
3,he had the last word,It was quite violent for my taste but it was an okay movie. The king had him killed but he left an air to the throne with the kings daughter.
4,Very cool movie,This is the preferred edition over the previously released US theatrical version.I suggest you catch the various incidents of the movie fresh.
2,"Generic war film, disappointing female lead","Most of the movie consists of war scenes that are a good sight, but nothing out of the ordinary: rain of arrows, computer generated ships, one man with the godly ability to smash through 10 spears unharmed. The focus on the battle scenes is a poor excuse for the sub-par acting on the part of Lin Chi Ling, who, despite having an important role in the plot, has a weak on-camera presence. Those who understand Chinese will be disappointed by Lin and several other actors' muffled Chinese pronunciations (I mean, come on, you are all professional actors--take a voice class or something). Furthermore, the acting abilities of the two male leads remain large un-utilized due to a run-of-the-mill script, and most supporting roles are left with even less material to act with (e.g. Hu Jun). Lastly, the sappy ending left me unsatisfied, knowing the ultimate rivalry that befalls all three kingdoms."
3,"BIG movie, predictable plot.","Sure, this is an ""epic"" movie with high production values. Just the extras, the costumes, the set, and the scenery are worth a watch. It's long, at times draging quite a bit; and the story is very familiar so it's predictable in a way. Lots of people die in stupid feudal wars than go on forever. Is this based on historical events? I don't know, though I doubt it. But, at some point I had to ask myself why so many are sacrificed, brutally killed, without a good reason. Movies like this give reasons but not satisfactory ones. Usually it's the bad bloodthirsty lord versus a benevolent lord. OK, no deep philosophical discoveries here, I get it. No problem. I'm here for the spectacle that this movie provides.Obviously a movie like this isn't about historical accuracy, but what is the greater point of such a movie? To tell a story with a moral, to see character development, to make the viewer ponder? None of this. But, as an action movie delivers, so I recommend it."
5,Red Cliff-Int'l Version,"I loved Red Cliff even in its shorter US theater release version but the international version delivers even more. For those who really enjoyed the DVD's, I'd strongly recommend the Moss Roberts Translation of Three Kingdoms and the 84 episode TV production of 1994 -- if you want to get a deeper appreciation of a very different kind of epic."
5,EXTRAORDINARY!,"Stunning photography, brilliant action, beautiful story (red cliff is only a small section of the chinese classic ""romance of the three kingdoms."" non-stop action andspectacular end sequence! a definite must-have! the international version is far better than the shortened version seen in the west. the advantage of the shorten version is that when the lead character appear on screen, a calligraphy of their character name with who they are is helpful as this doesn't happen in the international version. in the shorten version, one misses the overall story and sub-plots so definitely view the international version."
5,Classic Story,"I bought this for my dad and he loves the movie. Haven't seen it myself, but my dad really enjoyed it. His favorite story of all time is the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, so I try to get him any adaptations of the story for his collection. He says the movie is beautiful and the battle sequences are great. I'm not sure whether this movie would be confusing for people who don't already know and have read the novel."
5,Terrific movie,Terrific move!!!!! So anyway it makes me impressively and it is beautiful likes dove flys thru Cao Cao's camp and turtle war. WOW!!! They make me believing the true story about the small armed forces beat the largest naval and soldiers I read their stories about the wars thru the Wiki.
5,Best epic film I've ever seen,"Sound and video were incredible on this pair of blu-rays. The film itself, even though it clocked in at just under five hours, went by fairly quickly. Level of detail in the picture was just amazing. Buy it if you like history or epics on a grand scale."
3,Weaker Resident Evil Clone,"I must admit I am a diehard fan of the survival horror genre and as such, titles such as Resident Evil, Silent Hill and others will always be at the top of my list. I feel Alone in the Dark 4 aspires to be in the same league of these other games, but falls a bit short with a overly complicated plot, weak character development, and ridiculous monsters. One bright star in this title however is the wonderfully atmospheric backgrounds that do an excellent job of creating an authentic survival horror type environment..."
4,A pretty nice game,"Ill try to keep this simple for you.Alone in the Dark is definately creepy, even more so than Resident Evil. The game is definatley VERY long and can wear you down. Without a walkthrough, the game is almost impossible! The graphics are amazing, though. The camera angles are the same as resident evil (one shot from the corner and things like that). The controls are basically hopeless. The next game they make, I hope that they'll make it easier to actually walk like a normal person. This game is for anyone who can stomach quick, scary action, and suspense. This game is pretty nice."
5,Belly Fat Freedom,"These candies are the best. I am on the Belly Fat diet and have to limit my sugar to 6 grams a day. I have a insatiable sweet tooth and these rocky road caramels have saved me. They are fantastic, they curb my sugar craving and they are a great size."
3,Better for older kids.,"Was hoping to have much better tips for younger kids--as in the 5-year-old set. There was a Wall St. Journal article featuring the author, and his tips in that article were more succinct and what I was looking for regarding starting an allowance than this book was. But this is awesome for the tween and teen set with complete budgeting, spending and charitable donations worksheets. Would like more info. on the charity for the kids--like how to research, and invest in causes you believe in."
2,Not The Best Money Guide For Youngsters,"I was very disappointed with this money guide for children. It is probably more suited for late teens, but certainly not for ""kids"". Some of the concepts are too detailed and difficult to understand and the format presentation makes for difficult reading."
1,Dull and boring,"I bpught this cd for the wondeful sonf, A Love Divine, which i heard sung in a local catholic church by a lone female voice + piano. Beautiful in words and music. She captured the essence of the song. So i thought I'd like to have this wonderful spiritual on cd at home.However this version is slightly different tempo than the one I heard at mass, but it goes further. Here the chorus director has so mellowed and slowed the song, to where it just oozes and cralws. This lifelss and boring version is so far from the way the young lady and her accompaning piano player has ""divined"" this song. Its spiritless chorus like this one that can surely keep more folks away from the churches that as a means to draw the souls in.there's no other way to say it."
3,not what I expected,"I admit to being a purist about Christmas music. I really only want to listen to sacred music -- no snowflakes, no chestnuts, no sleighs, no reindeer, etc. So when I kept hearing selections from this on a Pandora playlist of hymns and anthems, I decided to get it. I guess I did not read the list of songs very closely but was very dismayed to have the reverence of ""What Child is This?"" followed by the ""Skater's Waltz."" What were they thinking? It also includes other secular songs and some adagios that are not any more about Christmas than skaters -- like Vivaldi's Winter. The music is well done and lovely -- just wish it were more about the babe in Bethlehem."
5,wonderful,"Many, many classic recordings of favorite christmas carols and pieces. I must say that the reviewer who said that Leontyne Price's vibrato was ""too wide"" should have his ears examined. Leontyne Price recorded her classic Christmas album (which, by the way, any lover of Christmas music or anyone who wants to hear pristine singing, should own) in the 1960's when she was in her absolute prime. A fast spinning vibrato is indicative of a NATURAL, healthy sounding voice, which is quite the opposite of what most uninformed choral conductors ask for these days OK, I'll get off my soap box now!"
5,Perfect for my sweaty hands.,I have crazy sweaty hands no matter what the temperature is outside and struggled with discs slipping out of my hand on drives. The Birdy Bag has SOLVED everything. It completely dries your hand/fingers without leaving a chalky dust that turns to slime.It is completely worth the money and has drastically improved my game.
5,Amazing Album,This album is a great compilation of songs from artists in the midwest. Anyone looking for great independent music shoudl check this out. The lyrics are very strong and the instrumentation is high quality.
3,Impossibly Difficult,This is a pretty cute little game. The graphics are pretty good. But for me it is impossibly difficult. I cannot do anything in the game! Even my son could not figure out how to play it. As with most game boy games the instructions were no help either. It only has general information. IE: Don't put the cartrige in backward. Don't put it in your mouth or you might choke. Etc.
5,great!,"I have always wanted a volleyball game for my game boy, because i love volleyball. I searched and found this one it is perfect!if you like volleyball you should definetly buy this!"
1,Simply working,"I probably had higher expectations for headphones. I have several headphones Koss Porta Pro and I am extremely satisfied. So I expected that Cobalt will be something similar.Unfortunately, the sound is much worse (I had to boost bass by more than 10dB), I think that there are different drivers. The method of hanging on the ear is not much convenient, headphones are hard and my ears start to hurt after some time.With my phone (Nokia), headphones disconnect after I press PAUSE and I have to turn bluetooth on the phone completely off and on in order to reconnect."
2,A bit of a disappointment.,"I suppose this is another example of why the people who actually write a piece of software shouldn't handle its documentation. This is a somewhat haphazard reference to GTK+; it doesn't have nearly enough information to act as a tutorial, even to an experienced C programmer, and yet it's not complete enough to act as a reference guide either. Like most hacker's documentation, this is far from clear and complete; it seems geared towards people who are willing to fill in the blanks in the text themselves through reading source code or online docs. Of course, if you need to do that, why bother purchasing the book in the first place? Just read the online docs. I wish I could suggest this book, as it is an ""open source"" manual, but there's better material out there."
2,This title is a bit outdated.,Please be advised when you order this that it was published in 1999. It uses GTK 1.x series and really isn't very helpful since 2.x is the current standard.
2,Dissapointing,"I bought this book hoping it would dilute the muck about linux GUI programming... Unfortunately, I found this to be very topical with a lot of the base of GTK. I can see this as more of a desktop reference rather than a intro/guide. I don't suggest buying this book if you don't already know a lot of GTK basics."
4,A how stuff works guide for GTK+,"This book is out-dated, and probably wouldn't make a good tutorial for a beginner. On the other hand, this is the only source of information I have found which explains GTK+ on a lower level. If you already know how to use GTK+ and want more information on how things like GObject or GDK work, this could be the book for you."
4,One of the classics,"Havoc covers the 1.x line of gtk+ here. It will give you a good idea what is required to develop robust cross-locale gtk+ apps, but it will not teach you how to use the most recent library. For this information, please see more recent books on this subject."
1,Outdated Technology,"This book is another in a lone line of shameless OpenSource hype. The book briefly covers all the inwards of GTK+ and advises you to buy another book made by the same company. Hmmmm...well that's normal. The book has no clear examples, and is actually more of a reference book than any type of tutorial. Great if you already know this stuff and need some refreshment. The Gnome technology is completely based of another more popular system *cough* Microsoft. This is one of those books that the only people who would buy it are those that don't need it. I actually expected to find out more of GTK+/Gnome but walked away very dissappointed. It seems as Linux gains more popularity, people just steal documentation of the web and convert it to book form. Non-inovative, non-original, and it is certainly not even worth 1/3 of the price!"
3,I Still Got Nuttin But Love For Heavy,"Got Me Waiting was the JAM! but the remix is one of the hottest remixes ever. I remember hearing that song on the radio and was like this is so dope. I'm not much of a Heavy D fan but his singles were actually pretty good. He's kind of played out now but at the time everyone use to love ol' Heavy. The person spreading rumors about him being dead is not right, you know Heavy D is not dead. The album as awhole was OK. I would prefer Got Me Waiting and the remix."
4,One of my favorites!!!,"This CD is definitely one of my favorites. You can almost listen to the whole CD straight thru!! With the help of Kid Capri on the title track and Easy Mo Bee on ""Black Coffee"" you can't go wrong with this purchase!! There are many guest appearances on here, especially on the first cut ""Friends & Respect."" ""Got Me Waiting"" is another track that is pretty good on here with the Vandross sample. Overall this is a pretty good purchase!! I recommend it!!"
5,Heavy D & The Boyz,Heavy D is one of the Best in the HIP-HOP Game a must buy Album tuffnuttin but love b
3,Underrated hip hop group...lost now.,"Heavy D and T-Roy are gone, but the songs are still out there...good intro album to the energy and hip hop message from the funky group."
5,My Lifesaver!,"This wedding planner was extremely helpful in keeping me sane while preparing for the biggest day of my life!!! I still have it, after over three years, and enjoy looking through it for memories' sake. :) Highly recommended"
1,Very Disappointed,The wedding planner was a gift to my friend and when I purchase it online I purchase a new one not used and when the planner came I just give it to my friend without looking inside... I was very embarrassed when she told me that someone had written in it already... the planner was very nice but i was not pleased with my purchase cause it was not honest!!!
1,Avoid this one,"Sounds simple enough, just what you need for occasional shipping jobs. But wait.... the metal buckles stick up too much for postal regulations, so you have to tape them up so nothing can snag on them. Kinda takes away a lot of the advantages of strapping. Then the strapping jams up in the box almost every time and you have to spend a lot of time getting it back on the roll; way too much time wasted. Take it out of the box and what a mess you have then; it all uncoils and now its pretty much unmanageable. Whoever called this a dispenser should be shot."
5,Perfect Machine!!!,I was debating between this and Dillon. Im so glad I went with this one. Dial everything in and its a snap to reload. Caliber change is very quick. Would recommend this to everyone looking.
1,received used item,this item was advertised as new but when i received it the plastic on the outside of the box had been broken and the owners manuals and all instructions were missing. also the bullet tray had scratches in the bottom of it. didnt really realize that this was the case until i saw another identical hornady press and it had all the instructions and paperwork with it. very disappointed with Amazon on this one. too late to return.
2,Okay CD,"I tried it and the mixture of genres is unique, but too novel for my taste. The chilean dude isn't chilean or so I hear."
5,Excellent source of information on this topic,There is probably no other resource on the topic of Justification that says so much in so few pages. I admit that this was a tough read at times but the information in here is right to the point. It points out the differences between Roman Catholic justification and Evangelical justification in a well thought out and well reasoned way.I highly recommend it.
4,Reference,"Since I reject the reformation doctrine, I seek to have the author's creed in hand in preparation for debates. The Scriptures do not teach ""justified by faith alone,"" rather, the Scripture teaches ""justified by faith."" There is a difference."
1,Good at Making You Angry,"If you have not been mad- I mean really good and mad- for a long time, this is the machine for you. It will guarantee frustration as long as you try to use it. I ordered this machine and the first one arrived broken. The second one worked but made the worst sounds when I would hit the return key, or backspace. Good for annoying my boss so I kept it. After a few days it randomly would assign margins, I would hit the margin release, clear any and all settings and it would work for a line or two and then at random indent, assign margins ect. No 2 lines of text would ever line up, and it felt like the typewriter equivalent to writing with a crayon. Eventually (within 30 days) I was unable to do anything with the machine. I could go on, but you get the point, I would pass on this machine."
1,Brother ml-300 not worth considering,I have had two of these units. I would definitely not recommend anyone buying the ML-300. Save yourself some money and get something else. Both of the units lasted only 14 months. I did hardly any typing with them. Only multi-page forms and applications. The printwheel motor failed on both of them and so did the electronic board for the keys. Took in in to a repair center and was told it was not worth repairing. Contacted Brother International USA and was told that the warranty was only good for 12 months. Save yourself some money and buy a Big Chief table and a number 2 pencil.
1,HORRIBLE...Run Away,"I needed a new typwriter for work as the old IBM gave up. Just needed something simple to do forms that wouldn't work through the computer, so picked this one. What a mistake! The margin adjustment thing laid out in the pathetic manual does not work..I have gotten where I just take paper out and put it in to get where I need to type since the preset typing area is so small and the margin adjustments just don't work at all. When I follow the instructions and release the margin then manually move the carriage back, the ink cartridge pops up and won't go down until you turn off the machine and restart. Total piece of junk. I recently purchased a sewing machine and am now so spooked by the Brother name I would only buy a Singer. Also, no support available from Brother."
4,Good book,"IN MEMORY OF MARIO PONTILLOSince the late 1970's, I have studied Mr. Lee's ""Way of the Intercepting fist.""Same binding as his defense book. Again, I have not read this one in over 20 years. Good fighting and throwing techniques.This book belonged to Mario.Please don't hesitate to check out my book that I published while in the U.S. Navy in 2003:""Under the Rose: Poetry of Tragedy, Essence, and Romance"""
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible","Please save your money, I was one of the persons who did not take into consideration what the reviews said about this book. You will be mad at yourself for wasting money."
1,No Preview,"What is the point of the free preview when nothing but the intro words are there with zero of the movie, not even a glimpse. Amazon, you do this all the time. If you're showing a 2 minute preview, how about actually showing 2 mins of the movie. Just a thought."
3,"""Full Speed"" Moves Too Slowly","In ""Full Speed"" we have another French film, apparently made on a low budget, that ultimately doesn't hold together very well. Perhaps something was lost in translation but I was left wanting more, not sure why what happened happened and unwilling to look at the movie again to try to put it together.The film is directed by Gael Morel and stars Mezziane Bardadi as Samir, a French Arab who has recently lost a lover because of an accident. He falls for Quentin (Pascal Cervo) who has just had his first novel published and is pretty much a cad. His best friend is Jimmy (Stephane Rideau). The film also stars Elodie Bouchnez as Julie who manages to sleep with both Jimmy and Quentin. Nobody seems to know exactly what he or she wants as A falls for B who falls for C who might fall for A or B.There is violence, death and the obligatory dose of angst. The French either do this sort of film very well or not so well. This one is not a keeper."
4,"hot,full of real worldy kinda stuff..it's a must see",this movie was hot and the actors were great talkin about a 90's version of gay difficulty threw very honest and heart achy stuff.. it's good
4,Fun & addictive racing game,"Graphics: 8.5/10Sound: 8/10Gameplay: 8.5/10Controls: 9/10Overall: 8.5/10This is a great racer that racing and even non-racing fans will have a lot of fun with.PROS...*Pretty to look at*Fast, fluid graphics*Good car control and physics*Very fast loading of game menus and races*Lots of cars to choose from*Variable skill levels*Good selection of coursesCONS...*Some ""pop-up"" of scenery graphics*Cars flip over too easilyIf the two negative aspects above had been addressed by the programmers, I would give this game five stars. These are relatively minor issues, however, and don't take away from my overall enjoyment of the game (and, in terms of the car flipping, it doesn't happen too much since I learned how to drive ;) ). All in all, Test Drive V-Rally is an excellent racing game, and one of the best available for the Dreamcast."
4,"Excellent Racer, with HUGE Replay value","Control is tight (for a rally race, that is...so 'realistic' is perhaps a better word). Plenty of cars and tracks, and if you get tired of all the tracks and weather combinations, there is a fairly strong track editor to allow you to make more. The only downside is perhaps that it suffers from the common 'invisible walls' dilemna. Great game!!!"
2,"decent game, absence of fun","this is a good, well made game. but it just isnt fun for someone who wants to buy a racing game that'll be good fun for himself and friends. the soundtrack is so bad that you need to turn it off, and then you realize that the sounds of the chainsaw engines isnt any better. the steering is hard, pretty much every time you go off the road to roll your car . there is about 10 ft on either side of the road in which you can actually drive, and then its just invisable wall. my advise for someone who isn't real serious on simulation, is do not buy this game and save you money and pick up 4x4 Evolution. i know i wish i did."
4,More of a rally game than Sega Rally...,"If you are a fan of rally racing, this is the only Dreamcast game that comes close. Unlike Sega Rally, this game factors in damage, repairs and true strategy (although I would love for someone to push all three a little further and factor in more catastrophic damage, random engine failure, etc.) There are still problems with some graphic glitches (your car can partially disappear in a wall, etc.) and vague instructions from the ""co-driver"" but overall, tt looks great, is a blast to play. Until someone brings Colin Mcrae Rally to the DC, this is the one to get."
5,THE BEST RALLY GAME,and I thought that sega rally 2 was good.....i was shocked when playing this game. the graphics are incredible and the gameplay is awsome. i recommend that you MUST buy it.
4,Good book to use as an outline,Such a big book for just an outline. When reading the book one is shown the chapter and verse with every short statement. Kind of set up as an outline for for a bible student in training.
5,Stuart RULES!,"The other day my friend made me listen to ""Practice Dying,"" prefacing it with ""You'll love it! It's this hilarious song about suicide."" I thought she was crazy, but listened anyway. I am so glad I did. 16 Nude is one of the best CDs I own. Stuart is funny, but also touching. And he is just SO awesome LIVE. ""Jonah"" is probably my favorite song; his awesome guitar and powerful lyrics combine best there to make something extraordinary. Stuart is funny, talented, and beautiful. You will definitely not be sorry you bought this CD."
2,a dangerous movie,"This movie is very entertaining but very dangerous for Bundy is here portrayed by the very nice and attractive Mark Harmon and he doesn't manage to reflect the cruelty, madness and hatred that sum bundy up. You get the idea he killed a few girls but when you read Ann Rule's book, you envison all the horror that's not reflected in the movie and whose abscence is an insult to the victims and their relatives. How can furthermore one call himself a bundyphile, what a sick comment to make. We are talking about a serial killer, a cruel, vicious murderer who terrified many young ladies and destroyed families."
3,"More About The Cops, Less About the Crimes","Me & my mum saw this a fair while ago & i was wondering where i could get it on video, but about the movie, Mark Harmon plays a brilliant role in it, the only gripe i would have is that there isn't much violence in it, it's more about the cops side of the story. The only violent scene is when he grabs the piece of wood & caves the heads in of the college girls. All in all, Mark Harmon has a good look of Ted Bundy in him, but it could be a better true story of Bundy. Look at the recent Ted Bundy movie for more of a sick portrayal of a serial killer."
2,Great movie,"This is a very interesting movie, a true story. Very full of suspence too. I highly recommend it."
1,The Deliberate Stranger,"I have seen this movie and Mark Harmon is excellent. However, I did not purchase this film as I thought the sellers carrying it made it too pricey."
1,Smart_Choice vendor is commiting Copy Right Infringment,I purchased this from Smart Choice Lady on Dec 4 for $58 as new. It is a cheap copy of the DVD that can be puchased form Warner Archieves for $19.95 I have since discovered. She even Copied the Labels and cover and to add insult to injury it could not be viewed except for the FBI Warning on Piracy. Beware of this person and her products.
3,Strong on intrigue weak on accuracy,"I must admit I've seen this miniseries half a dozen times. Harmon creates a chilling image of a self-absorbed, glib Bundy. The series does a good job of portraying the agony of the victim's families and the terrifying randomness of Bundy's crimes. However, this is the `dramatized for television' version of Bundy's life and crimes and it's far from accurate. Significant players, such as Ann Rule, are written out of the story entirely. I suspect this is because the film is based on Richard Larsen's book Bundy--The Deliberate Stranger, which rivaled Ann Rules The Stranger Beside Me . Which is a brilliant account of Bundy's crimes and the Ted Bundy she new personally. Enjoy the mini-series, but for the best account of Bundy's life and crimes check out Ann Rules book."
2,What a disappointment,"As a true ""Bundyphile"", I really looked forward to this mini-series. From the get-go (the two women snatched at Lake Sammimish Park), I thought the film was incredibly flat. The producers-directors seem to spend more time on the period clothes, the make-up and hair styles - it was just vapid. While there was one truly effective scene (Bundy carrying Caryn's Cambell's naked body through the snow), the rest of the movie seemed to just trivialize a dark, deep and disturbing story. And sorry, Tom Harmon, as someone said, his ""acting ran the gamet from A to B"". I hope we see a well made, serious film about Ted Bundy someday."
1,Police Brutality,"I do not like the way this television movie portrayed OfficerDavid Lee, the Pensacola, Florida police officer who arrestedBundy on February 15, 1978. The real Officer Lee was a truepoliceman who was dedicated to doing his job. This movie madehim out to be a blue-uniformed bully who went around beating upon suspects and who seems to enjoy doing it. This movie stinks!"
3,Not as good as I remembered it to be,"The only time I ever saw this movie before ordering it was in 1993 and I remember it scaring me more. However, when I watched it this time, I noticed that the film moves very quickly and we don't get to know the victims. Being made-for-TV and being made in 1986, I knew it wouldn't be very graphic which was fine by me. I also noticed that many of the victims' names were changed. I'm a stickler for details so I don't understand the reasoning behind this (I know the families have to give the OK for the victims' real names to be used) but you can easily find the victims' real names on the internet. I don't think it was worth the $25 I paid for it. ""The Capture of the Green River Killer"" was much better. If you want to buy it, I would recommend buying it cheaper from another buyer."
4,Great Movie - bad copy of VHS tape,"I was disappointed in the quality of the film on this VHS. The movie itself is outstanding, with great acting by Mark Harmon. I would have enjoyed it more if the picture didn't jump up and down so much during the movie. I'm not ordering any more VHS tapes. As I said, the movie was fabulous and very suspenseful."
4,good movie,I saw this movie on tv several years ago. Mark Harmon does an excellent job protraying Ted Bundy. It's a good movie without all the blood and gore.
4,Still Haunting after all these years,"I have thoroughly enjoyed Mark Harmon's work over the years, but his portrayal of serial killer Ted Bundy remains one of my favorites. To be honest the movie plays off more than a few of the myths surrounding Bundy and has been stripped of all but the most prominent elements from the investigation. It is based on the book by Richard Larsen (rather than the more interesting and richer Stranger Beside Me by Ann Rule). Most of the names have been changed and the character development is weak, so if you are looking for a biopic you won't find it here. That said, Harmon is positively captivating for his ability to shift between smooth talking law student and sociopath. There have been only a couple of serial killers akin to Bundy (most notably Rodney Alcala), but I think Mark Harmon captures the essence of the horrific Bundy mystique."
5,Mark Harmon's portrayal of Ted Bundy....Excellent,Excellent portrayal by Mark Harmon of Ted Bundy. Well acted. Hard to find this movie on TV. I recommend this DVD.
4,Enjoyable indie,Though this movie was pretty entertaining. It wasn't as funny as listed on trailer but I thought there was some funny scenes. The florida story is pretty crazy but I went to college there so no doubt this could have been true. Worth a watch if looking for indie odd ball drama.
3,Very well done!,"I acted in this film so I may be biased but...Great film. Loosely based on real events. The production company (out of New York City), director (Erika Yeomans), staff, was first class. Wonderful experience...had a great time. Definitely worth the price for some low cost entertainment. Would work for Erika again anytime!"
1,This product should get a zero rating,"=I bought this set under a different listing and when I got it one of the bit racks had broken lose and bits were rattling all over which is bad for the cutting edges. After about an hours use the 1/4"" straight bit broke. Spend a little more and get a good set. I'm buying a big name brand like Freud, etc...DONT' BUY THIS!"
3,Bitter Aftertaste,"I wish I had done a little more research before purchasing this item. After using it for a day I looked up more information on gymnema and found out it was the culprit behind the bitter medicine aftertaste in my mouth. Apparently gymnema is such a great sugar killer that it also affects your taste buds, even several hours after taking the pills. So, if you are after reducing or eliminating your desire for carbs or much of anything else, this might be a good thing to try. I am going to try just taking it before I go to bed, but this is not within the product recommendation and of course it would be better to take along with each meal. I've already ordered straight chromium polynicotinate so I am hoping that will better suit my needs. I want to eat less carbs too, but my real intent is to enhance the function of my pancreas and still enjoy the act of eating."
2,Dissatisfied,I have almost finished the third bottle of this product and it has NOT changed my blood sugar level at all.
5,great product,"Great product. Contains all the major herbal alternatives to Metformin. Can really help with blood sugar-relatd acne or PCOS. I learned from my genetics (23andme) that I am prone to diabetes and macular degeneration, so I'm using this as well as Jarrow carnosine to prevent blood sugar problems."
2,Didn't do much for me,"I have impaired fasting glucose (~130 when I wake up) so I was hoping this product would make a dent in that. I have tried it faithfully for over a month now and have noticed no change in my morning test. If I take three at a time it also makes me feel a bit dizzy (vertigo?). Others (and at other web sites) continue to rate it highly, so you might have a better experience. Won't be ordering this again."
2,Hard to read...,"Perhaps I tried to read this book too soon after my wife's death, but I had trouble keeping interest in the book. I have heard several others who say it helped them handle their grief, but it wasn't helping me. It seemed to me the author did a lot of repeating of ideas or theories. I have the book as well as the downloaded version and will try again after more time has passed."
5,excellent,Excellent book on grief and mourning. Very helpful in putting many aspects of grief into perspective to help face and move through the process.
2,Poor Sound,"I bought this memorex ipod video player, because it had a larger screen than the sonic player. However, the sound quality is WAY inferior with the memorex, the maximum volume is still pretty low and distorts the sound on the ipod, making it necessary additional speakers. Why have built-in speakers then?I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,I should be better,"I bought it with the hopes that my vast collection of videos on my 80Gig iPod would now be viewable on an 8.4"" screen. No dice. This device has some deep set problem with widescreen content. All of my WS videos appear stretched at the 16:9 setting and though they look normal at the 4:3 setting, I have to view them with padding bars on both the top and sides?!? Memorex needs to go back to the drawing board here. It only has svideo out instead of composite out. There is a also a problem where I can hear humming during the low volume times of a video. No replaceable battery rounds out the list. I don't plan on keeping it. Maybe version 2..."
2,Much better options out there,"I just bought this item and as soon as I saw the video quality, decided I should return it. If you aren't tech savvy and don't understand all the descriptions about the video quality, then this description should help you: it looks like watching a pirated movie. You know the type that you can buy off the street where some guy just took a camcorder into the movie theatre? That's what your dvd quality video will look like on this thing. So suffice to say - it looks awful. Its a shame really because I liked the build, the weight, the dual-earphone inputs - but overall, if you are getting this item its so you can watch your ipod videos on a bigger screen - and when you watch them on this screen you'll see how bad the image looks and instead squint your eyes and just stare at the ipod for two hours."
3,Good Video but poor design,"The video is good, battery life is excellent, sound is satisfactory. But the exterior design of the unit is poor.Within few days dust gets deposited in the left and right part of the ipod docking station which is mesh like thing (cannot be seen in the picture) covering audio speakers and its very difficult to clean it. The unit is thick and heavy."
1,wont work,does not work on 5th gen 160 per manufactuerlisted as working on 5th gen devices.i bought an iluv 1166 instead works great
1,Poor Video Card,"The heatsink fan is poorly attached to the card. One of the clips broke free and let the heatsink pull away from the GPU, causing the card to overheat."
5,Great!,"It is nice you can finally buy these clips. Losing the clips is a real headache, and before this I would just go out and buy another ace bandage. Thanks for carrying a needed product."
1,poor manufacturing,I purchased the elastic clips for my ace bandages. Thinking the price is right and the other clips I have lost. The first four I tried three of them fell apart. So far I have gone through ten of them and they do not hold in place. Not happy with them at all!!
1,Craptastic for Elastic,"I thought these fasteners looked like a real improvement over the old, rigid 100% metal ones, but they aren't. They fell apart. And BEFORE they fell apart, they proved impossible to keep on; they kept popping off.So I'm back to the old,dependable metal ones from now on.I don't understand why these got so many positive reviews!"
3,decent,"I got these for my fisheries classes and for early year wading while fishing. the boot construction is good, and they are very waterproof. My only complaint is that the buckle to attach them to your belt is very cheap and easily breakable. If this part hadn't broke on my first outing in them they would have received a 5 star rating, especially for the price."
1,hip boots,the boots have a slow leak. the only reason i dont return them because i broke a strap. if you buy any bootsi would test them by putting them in bucket of water and see if they leak
4,LaLicious Coconut Oil,"I couldn't wait until my body oil arrived... It smells awesome. I guess, the only flaw I have with it, is that, it's very heavy on my body and feels like i'm putting grease on me. But, it works good and makes my skin feels very smooth"
3,light & airy,"This little romance does little to tug the heartstrings, but is a rather enjoyable bit of escapism. The murder mystery is almost humorous at times and the byplay between the leads is often witty. Daniel is a reformed rake who can't seem to remember the reformed part when he's around Isabella, who is determined to remain unmarried and live life by her own rules...until she realizes she can't get enough of Daniel.The dialogue is sometimes stilted or silly, and there are occasions when the exposition halts the flow of the story. As mentioned, there are no great heartaches (past or present) nor any overwhelming passion (though they can't keep their hands off each other). It's diverting, but not exceptional. The secondary romance really could have used its own book."
5,Literally my fave,Love this book - Love this author! Great series!Wanting more!! Captivating read! I hope she writes more - I am hooked!!
3,"Little bit of everything, but not enough.","This was an enjoyable, light-hearted read. It has a little bit of everything, but not a lot of anything that would make it a special book I would want to reread. When I say a little of everything, I mean humor, passion, mystery, angst and the required, I finally realize I love her/him, but they probably don't feel the same. The story of Daniel's sister and his best friend would probably be an interesting story. Maybe Miss Grey has a story about them in the works.I was provided a copy of book by Netgalley."
3,Read was ok,"I read the book titled A Little Mischief by Amelia Grey and it has a bit of mystery and romance. I usually like more depth in reading historical romances. This story didn't quite give it to me. The characters seemed kind of ho hum. Isabella Winslow and Daniel Colebrook who are the love interest are going around searching for clues in a murder. I really didn't feel that they would take it upon themselves to investigate a murder of a peer, when a family member should have done it. I would like more sexual tension to get the juices going. I would not waste my money on buying it because there are more interesting books available."
2,Not representative Teyte,"Maggie Teyte is known, for the most part, for her French Art Song recordings. This Decca 'Singers' edition, while entertaining, is not representative of her best, or indeed, her most iconic work. For that, you'll need to turn to her EMI recordings. All that said, these recordings show her in marvellous voice, and a couple of the performances, the Hahn and the Dvorak 'Songs my mother taught me' are very special."
3,"Best for train, not New York City, buffs","Don't be misled by the title into thinking that this book is mainly about the history of the NYC subway system. While the genesis of the NYC subway is covered, particularly the first IRT line, it forms only a modest part of the book, which also describes the start of the Boston, London, Glasgow and other subways, and the development of the commuter rail network into New York City. The book also dwells a lot on the physical, mechanical and electrical attributes of rolling stock, electricity supply, line construction methods, etc., for the various systems. While this does put the NYC subway system into context, it doesn't make for a particularly ""light"" read or give the reader an overall perspective on how the entire NYC subway system developed during the past 100 years and its impact on the city."
2,Just a mediocre book of lesser extent,"First, the title reads fine. But there's a catch. This kind of title sounds like it covers all. The truth is. It ain't true. Second. The author's attitude. I'd rather say the author is talking to himself."
5,SATISFIED,Book is much more infomative than expected.Quite helpful for first time Min/Pin owners.Abundant info. THANK YOU!
4,Well-written account of the building of a golf course.,"Only a small % of the population has ever heard of theprofession of golf course architect, but a large % of thatgroup dreams of quitting the day job and designing golfcourses for a living.For them, Strawn vividly describes all aspectsof the building of an Arthur Hills golf course in Florida.Strawn is equally good at describing the golf strategy thatgoes into the course, the lives of the construction workers,and the hassles with bureaucrats.Certainly the best book ever written on the building of asingle golf course. (Ok, it's probably the only book everwritten on this topic, but it's still quite goodin absolute terms).Steve Sailersteveslr@aol.com"
1,Stay close to a bathroom,"Can't be sure if this would work, because I couldn't last more than 2 days. Like clockwork, had to ""run"" to the bathroom 30 minutes after taking a single pill. 50mg is the dosage necessary to see the effects based on the scientific study, so I thought about this product. Plus you're supposed to take it for an extended period before you start to see results. Because I couldn't last more than 2 days, I'll never know. It just didn't suit my digestive system. Your results may vary, but I'll be returning my bottle."
1,Don't bother,"This was a waste of money. I didn't find any improvement whatsoever while taking this product. This was recommended on the Dr. Oz show, but I didn't see any benefit from it"
5,Great romp!!!,"A beautifuly written romp through the realms of science fiction and fantasy. I've read it at least seven times and still can't put it down once I've started. Carver creates a wondrous blend of action and emotion. This is one of the few books that can make me cry, especially after having read it so many times. It claws at your heart and tears a great hole. For me the hole becomes bigger every time. A must read for all who love dragons."
2,HINT BOOK AVAILABLE!,"I have an unopened hint book, but don't have the game. anyone interested in any details? Sounds like a good game!"
2,Friday the 13th!,"I wanted a wristwatch for daily use, not too flashy and with a metal band, date and day.Bulova has a good name and it looked fine so I ordered it.The first thing noticable was, that it was pretty havy. But the almost amusing detail was, that the date was set for Friday the 13th, which was not the correct date anyway, making it somewhat of a bad omen.Well, just two days later, I had problems in setting the day and it persisted (on and off) for the next few days. Since the adjusting felt very vague, I decided not to take any chances and to return it.Ahango"
1,Bad Book!,I checked with the local telephone man and the drawings on how to hook up the telephone are illegal and can get you hurt. The restoration methods will damade the telephone and a collector will not want your phone. I feel that this book is a sham and would not recommend it. If you are looking for some help restoreing a old telephone check out your local telephone collecting group.
3,May contain phosphates?,"I use all Kent supplements and they all say ""Does not contain phosphates, nitrates, or gluconates!"" This bottle doesn't include that statement though. I had a slime algae outbreak and in adding another circulation pump and stopping the addition of the iodine, the slime is 90% gone. I also recently got my protein skimmer back up and running, so I can't say with certainty that the iodine contributed to the outbreak but just be careful."
4,Gears Of Gore...,"NEEDLE is a nice slab of revenge-horror nastiness w/ a supernatural edge. It concerns a group of college friends who begin dying in godawful (and quite original) ways, after one of them inherits a mysterious wooden box. The survivors must figure out what's happening and how to stop the carnage, if they want to live. Just imagine if SAW's Jigsaw could use black magik, and you'll be pretty close to guessing how this one goes. Extra points for A- The cool-looking box of doom, and B- the way it works. Ghoulish stuff indeed... P.S.- Watch for John Jarratt (WOLF CREEK, ROGUE), as the medical examiner!..."
1,Not another evil box!,"Here, for the umpteenth time, is the lost/stolen relic that gives evil powers to it's possessor. In this case we put a photo of a person into a box then put the obligatory activating/donation blood into a receptacle along with some wax and lo and behold a little wax voodoo doll slides out on a tray to which you can mutilate to your heart's desire resulting in the same effect upon the person in the photo.Yes, the person doing the nasty deed is the one least expected (it wouldn't be a jealous/vengeful female would it?) and yes, a few people die along the way. In an anti-climatic ending - she gets the box turned on her. A little stab on her voodoo surrogate doll and she just keels over.If you need to see this then you'll probably FF through the inane script and high school drama class acting to see our poor sacrifices. Total effective viewing time for the four lambs is about four minutes of prosthetic blood.On the positive side, it was a nice box."
1,UNSATISFIED,"I FOUND THE KIT TO BE JUNK ,THE PARTS WOULD NOT STAY ON EVEN AFTER ALL THE INSTRUCTUONS WERE FOLLOWED,LOW QUALITY MATERIAL."
4,Good basic replacement cradle mattress,"We bought this for a family cradle. Worked well, just the right size. A bit on the thin and slippery side, but waterproof cover has been a very nice thing in the long run. Shows absolutely no wear after 6 months of use."
3,Frequent Flyer Help,This book should provide one who's new to using FF miles help. It will be a disappointment to longstanding users of FF miles - there are no new surprises in the book's contents.
2,Dated: Copyright 2005,"There is information here valuable to a mileage starter. But it's very dated. This book needs an updated edition to justify selling it through this website. If you are new to the mileage game check your library or used bookstore, but don't pay for a book giving advise when 2/3 of the content is no longer relevant."
3,Beautiful but flimsy,"The butterfly is truly beautiful, but it attached to the leather cord necklace by a flimsy piece of wire. The wire broke upon the third time wearing it. It is repairable with some jewelry wire or an actual clasp."
1,Warning --- product develops mold inside,"We purchased two sets of this product within a few weeks of each other. One set in the UK and one in the US. After a few months, we noticed that there was black mold inside the product. We cut open one of the balls and noticed the mold. This happened with both sets. We have not tried to return the product as it had been used for a few months."
5,Darling,These are darling! We play with them in the pool and my grandson thinks it's so funny how they stick to the pool tile!
2,Winegard RD-9046 Portable satellite dish,"We have been camping in our fifth wheel lately in parks/areas without local or cable tv. Not wanting to spend $700 to $800 for a Vuqube I thought the RD-9046 would be a good place to start and see how much we might use it. I initially set it up at my home and after about three attempts I got it to work. I had no luck on site at a remote campsite and gave up after several attempts. The documentation accompanying the dish is not very helpful in actually getting a signal, nor was DirectTV, my satellite provider, helpful in explaining what was required. I am still not sure which satellite is the one I am looking for. The Vuqube with an alleged auto search feature is looking more attractive. Unless the providers, Winegard and DirectTV, are more helpful, or you understand how all this works I would go for the more expensive products."
2,Couldn't get it to work.,We purchased this portable unit for our travel trailer. But couldn't get it to work with our tv. We were very disappointed with the directions sent with this unit. Not very helpful. We ended up sending the satellite back to the company.
1,"Difficult to use, Seller is no help","This Dish antenna was purchased to use while camping in northern California. I purchased the antenna in March and went camping in late May. After numerous attempts to align the antenna I gave up. On my return I contacted Directv and was given some instructions. In October I again went camping. Following all the instructions given I was still unsuccessful. I believe the dish was defective so I contacted the seller, Price Pros. I gave them the date I had purchased the antenna and they told me it was past their return time and there was nothing they could do. They referred me to the manufacturer. Price Pros clearly had no interest in providing any help. The sellers responce was disapointing and unacceptable. I would recommend not buying from this seller as they provide no help with their product."
1,SERVICE stinks,Servicing under the 90 day warranty is impossible. They stall until afer 90 days and then tell you it's out of warranty. Good luck!
5,Had it !! Used it!! Loved it - For 3 years,"We made lots of money with this system when we had our mailbox store. Got supplies from coastalbusinesssupplies and sold these stamps everyday. This is a very good machine. we must have made over 300-400 stamps, using the software and it worked great. I would highly recommed this hardware for anyone who wants to make rubber stamps in house."
1,Problems for the purchase,"Amazon doesn't sell in Italy, so I have made a purchase of test using an address in lease in the United States, the result he has been that later over one month I have not received what I have purchased and I don't know yet when I will receive it. I think that despite the very convenient price for my next purchases I will address me to an European firm that quietly sends in Italy."
5,A 15 year old teen who loved the book,"This book reminded me so much of what I go through. I really want to thank omar Tyree. So much of my time goes to school,work, and other thing that its just good to sit down and enjoy a good book. I'm 15 and I know what Tracy is going through I don't think I will enjoy ""For the love for the money"" as much because she can't relate to me. Anyone who has read this book and enjoyed it should read ""The coldest winter ever"". This book told the life of a young lady who does some of the same things that I do today. We all go through that. Omar was just being real and if you don't like it then o'well."
1,"This book is a waste of paper, ink, and time","This book was sophomoric at best, trite, banal, and vulgar at all other times. Bebe Moore Campbell, Eric Jerome Dickey, Benilde Little, et. al. have NOTHING to worry about."
3,Not So Flyy,"I just finished this book yesterday and I still can't figure out who the target reader is. It's certainly isn't for a teenage audience, and I think it's a little bit childish for the more mature people. Who wants to read about 12 year-olds having sex on a regular basis? I felt that the plot was weak and I really did not like Tracy's character because she is nothing but a spoiled brat. However, I did enjoy reading the book because it was entertaining. It's not really the type of book that gets you talking about it months after you've read it. You just enjoy it for the time that you are reading it and you kinda forget it after.I was slightly disappointed by it because I read A Do Right Man recently. I hope his other novels are better."
2,No no no no noooo!,"I agree with B.M. and Becky Sue. I absolutely hate the way thatthis young African-American woman was portrayed. And the ending wascompletely implausible! It is very rare if not downright impossible for a young woman to lead such a filthy life and engage in gratuitous sex at such a young age, and still become somewhat successful. There is nothing entertaining about a young woman behaving as a whore, and showing absolute disrespect for her body. This book should be stripped from the bookshelves before any young women, particularly African-American young women, are giving the unfounded impression that they can live as such and not be horribly punished. Thanks."
1,*SMH,"*The author frequently misspelled simple words (uh uh, shut up, aww, ooh, and quite and a few others), forgot major details (like the decade the main character was born, and described a completely opposite outfit one character wore, ON THE SAME PAGE), wrote the same scenario most of the book (detailed sex scenes of 13 year old girls sleeping around with much older boys which is just disturbing). It is taking me forever to finish the book because it is so bad. This drawn out scene passed off as a book is for an idiot with no imagination who isn't used to reading. Had I checked this out at the library I wouldn't have felt obligated to read even half of it, but since I bought it on ebook I figure I have to stomach through the last half... It's what I get."
3,a bubble gum version of coldest winter ever,it was okay for a pre-teen or teenager. i loved cwe better. but it was alright.
3,Interesting book,"I found Flyy Girl to be a good read but a slow starter. I had never read books by Mr. Tyree but I think it could have been better. I don't think I want to read the sequel but I was able to get through this one. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone but I don't want discourage anyone from reading it either. It was too slow for me, I needed something that would keep me on the edge of my seat making me not want to put it down and this was not that kind of book."
1,Poor dialogue. Trite prose.,"This book is terrible. The dialogue is juvenile. The storyline is unworthy of my time. I tried to finish the book, but then I thought life's too short to spend time on such dribble. I absolutely love to read black fiction, so I thought I'd give it a try. I just couldn't get through it. I'd recommend Terri McMillan, Eric Jerome Dickey, Sheneska Jackson, Bernice McFadden, Lolita Files . . . among others. These writers are excellent. On Wednesday, I'm giving Flyy Girl to the folks at the recycling center."
1,This book was a big disappointment,"This book was a big disappointment. I was certainly expecting an adult book not something written for an eighth-grader. The characters were so one-dimensional that I truly did not care what happened to any of them. I wouldn't even recommend this book for a teenager because I personally hated the common depiction of young black females as greedy, manipulative, sluts - happy to trade sex for gold trinkets and clothes. After going at a snails pace through the most tedious details of Tracy's amoral life, Omar Tyree tries to wrap everything up too quickly at the end. Tracy comes across, cold and shallow and the book as a whole was very unrealistic. The most amazing thing about this book was that I actually finished reading it."
1,Not my cup of tea,The biggest disappointment for me was the fact that within this story the characters never transitioned into adulthood. I could have dealt with the bad choices made by this young teenage girl IF there was a redeeming ending. Many adults may not find this book entertaining because we can't relate - what adult wants to read about the sexual escapades of a teenager? And I wouldn't reccommend that teenage girls read it either...because there is no moral lesson to be learned.I did enjoy another book by this author: A DO RIGHT MAN. That was more my speed - the characters were actually grown ups!
5,tremendous,"I love reading this book. I was one of the first books that I read from Omar Tyree. It's my favorite book. I've read it 4 times. Flyy Girl reminds of my best friend who was just like Tracy. I told her she had to read this book, because she was out of control. Sixteen and expecting baby #2. I gave her the book. After she read Mr. Tyree's book. The girl did a 360 degree turn. She went back to school, got her high school diploma, and now she's in her senior of college. I'm so proud of her. Mr. Tyree I just want to say thank you for writing such an aspiring book. Thanks again."
2,Don't waste your time with this one...,"This novel is a sad example of the commercialism of the African American literature genre. It doesn't challenge the reader at all with its elementary sentence structure. Unfortunately, this is evident on all of the Omar Tyree novels I have read to date. Don't waste your reading time with this one..."
3,Almost Real-life Ghetto-ism,"This book is almost too far fetched to be real, the more you read it, despite the unrealistic situations, you can't help but be caught up in Tracey's life. I finished the book, mostly because I wanted to know exactly how Tracey was going to end up. It wasn't until the end of the book that I actually began to like Tracey... I thought her to be a really shallow and spoiled girl.... who deserved everything that she got. If you are searching for some deep and insightful message... then don't buy this book, but if you wnat an entertaining read.... where the main character spends most her time as a 14 year old...then go for it. In the end Tracey kind of evolves as a person... but... it taks her so long to get there... you almost lose interest!"
3,Interesting,"Let me start by saying that this book was interesting. Reading about Tracy and her life kept me turning the pages, but the storyline was sorely lacking in anything resembling depth. My other problem with the storyline was that scenes just sort of repeated themselves but with just a different boy in her life. After about halfway through, I felt like I'd read the same scenes over and over again, just with a different ""guy of the week"" in her life at that time. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I were a teenager or a girl but I'm neither. With that said, it was interesting enough to keep me turning the pages but I personally would not recommend this book to anyone."
3,Interesting,"An interesting book. Captivating if you are looking for a less complicaed novel. I would have liked it to have gone into more detail about Raheema as she was a character, opposite of Tracey and a little more complex, who could have been a refreshing break from the self-centered narrative into Tracey's daily adventures. Overall, a pretty solid book."
1,A waste...,"This book is a waste. It could hardly hold my interest through 40 pages, and by that time it was clear the direction the book was heading: into a list of a girl's sexual escapades. If you'd like to read that, then this is for you. Otherwise, avoid this boring novel and head towards Terri McMillan or E. Lynn Harris who write books that are both interesting and have great love scenes."
1,TOO IMMATURE,"I Actually read this book about 8-9 yrs ago. I was not impressed. This book is for teenagers. Not adults. I really wish our black authors would write substantial material,especially for our young men and women whom need mental stimulation other than this ghetto stuff. This book sucks."
3,An interesting look back at the '80's.,"I grew up with girls like Tracy. She got off easy. The young women I knew all ended up pregnant. The plot was thin, but I would recommend it to friends who had similar experiences."
4,First loves are forever,"WOW, take me back to the 80's. This was a great book to just ""read"". You could put it down and start back up a week later and enjoy it. This book depicted the way things were when I was growing up. I loved it and am going to search more of Tyree's books. Hope they are as flamboyant and easy reading as this one was. The ending was great - I also am stuck on my 1st sexual experience - that's why I married him!"
2,give me a break,"If I had to read Aw'ight one more time in this book I was going to throw it. It was hard to read because of all of the slang, or should I say iritating. Tracy was stupid and fast. I was confused with Raheema and her situation. Didn't these kids ever have supervision. Going to party's late. Tracy's mother seemed to have a little sense, but she is going to allow her child to receive gifts, expensive at that, from boys who had no jobs. Whatever!!!!!! I was truly disappointed."
1,the worse,this book is easily the worse that i have ever read. It was poorly written and all of the characters in the book were described in one sentence. for example: he had a dark brown face and thin eyebrows!!! that's only about 1 million young black men in Philly. i would give this to my 13 year old niece but I would never recommend it to an adult who reads a lot. i hope his other books are better than this....
3,Okay but not the best-not even close!,I was very disappointed by this book. I really believed that it would have developed at a greater level than it did. This book is on the level of my 13 year old cousin!
3,"Ahhh, Nostalgia","What a trip down memory lane! Once, I got over the initial shock of realizing that I'm old enough to be reading books about my teen years, I enjoyed this book.It was a little long, but overall I felt it was worth the time I invested in finishing it. I realize this book was about Tracy, but I wish the author had spent a little more time dealing with her parents' relationship. It was so undefined, especially when they have another child after the father sets up a seperate household -- and doesn't move back in. What in the world was going on?Anyhow, I really liked this book. I got a kick out of remembering the styles (gold bamboo hoops and assymetrical hairdos) and slang of my youth. I will recommend it to my 16-year-old niece who is quite the ""Flyy Girl"" herself.I look forward to reading the sequel later this year."
1,Don't read this piece of trash,I can honestly say that this is one of the worst books I have ever read in my life. Not only was it poorly written but it was deeply offensive. How this man was able to build a career by continuing to spit out garbage like this is beyond me.I really wish Mr. Tyree would start reading in addition to writing. Maybe then his writing will improve.
4,Great Book!,"I liked ""Flyy Girl"" because Tracy's character was so refreshing--so obnoxious, so confident, a break from depressed main characters wallowing is self hatred. She is selfish though--only caring about wearing the best clothes and getting on with the best guys, but that's a portrait, I'm sure, of many girls growing up. I know girls like that. At least in the end she became a stronger person--with a focus and a purpose, a realization that life isn't all about her and clothes and boys. Her story concludes with her more mature, but not changing completely, just adapting."
3,a book for young girls not women,"This book takes place against the backdrop of Philadelphia around the 1980. It follows the main character, Tracy on her journey from hating boys to loving them then to being used by them. The book got tiresome at points and you really wanted to smack Tracy for being so [darned] gullible. She seemed more ignorant of the ways of men then I would expect any girl who grows up in Philly to be. (I should know I live there). There are redeeming qualities about her that make you hope that she gets her head together but for the most part you read and shake you head at this girls immaturity. Read this book if you're 16 and under. Any older and the you have too much knowledge of men and their ways."
4,The truth is Flyy enough for me,"This book is real and even though many people dont appreciate the streotypes, we must face it because the greedy, gold diggin ways do exist in too many of our obviously misguided women.Growing up I secretly envied girls like Tracy but as time went on I realized that being cute, fass and familar with all the boys was not worth all the embrrassment that would definetly come to haunt you after everyone has had their free ride. This book just reminded me of how proud I should be of myself and hopefully all the young girls that read this book will take the time to reflect on their lives and make any neccessary changes. The one thing that I didn't like about this book was the ending, it seemed like it was rushed, Other than that it was Flyy!"
3,"Even though I wasn't a teeanger in the eighties,","Tracy Ellison reminded me of myself when I was in the eighth grade. In junior high, I remember being taller for my age and looking older. And I also remember out-dressing the other girls back in the eighth grade, too. I can also relate to Raheema. Because all through junior high and high school, I would try to keep my virginity, and I would get a little tense whenever a guy would ask me to have sex with him."
1,A great disappointment,I was very disappointed in this book. I struggled through it but will be very careful before I buy another book by Mr. Tyree. I felt the characters were poorly developed. One of the things that makes a great book is that you need to connect with the characters. All I wanted for the characters to do in this book was disappear.
3,OT Review,Good book...not as well as I thought it would be. It was a good enough read to tide me over until I could get something more substantial.
2,Not for me,I didnt learn from this book. Like really whats the meaning??? Oyeah she was Flyy thats about it. I'm not even thinking of getting part 2 SMH :-/
3,Classic Throw Back,"Well as a teenager this was one of my favorite books. All the profanity, sex and drama was so interesting to me. Every chance I got I buried my head in this book. So I decided to buy the book, reread it and see if my thoughts about the book were still the same.... Absolutely NOT! It did bring back some memories.... but I mostly was nodding off. This isnt a bad book it just depends on the mindset of the reader, in my opinion as a teen you'll enjoy it cause it's uncut and filled with what most teenagers are doing or thinking of doing. I myself am almost 30 yrs old so this is not my cup of tea. Wouldn't recommend. Gave it 3 stars beacuse I did enjoy Flyy Girl in my younger years."
5,YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK!,"Omar Tyree did an awesome job with this book! When I read it I had already heard great things about it and none of the things that were told to me were embelished in any way. It was a great book! I think I enjoyed it so much because it was one of the first books I read that the characters seemed so real. I felt like in some way I could relate to the characters which made the book even more enjoyable. It had a lot of twists and turns, and things you wouldn't expect. I would definately encourage you to read this book I couldn't put down!"
5,The Best Book I Have Read !!!!!,Well what can I say Flyy Girl is the book to have once you start it you just wont be able to put it back down. I think flyy girl is a book that every girl should read. Even though tracy was a fast girl she learned many lessons.While reading the book i felt like i was in it with her it felt like i really knew all the charaters.I really enjoyed the book and hope that every girl gets a chance to read it. ~Ariel
2,Just ok,"Thi s book was just ok. It took too long to get to the point as I have noticed with Omar Tyree books. I mean how long can you stay between 12 and 15. I mean some of us want to preserve our age, but that was a little too much for me. Read this book if you are on a long trip and need to sleep."
2,"ummm, now that i'm a grown woman...","this just wont work. i did finish it, but i realized that if i'd read this book when i was reading judy blume and sweet valley high back in the sixth grade, then i would've enjoyed it better. i'm doing this review after having read both flyy girl and for the love of money. flyy is okay...for the love is awful. i wont even bother to do a separate review for it. why did he plug for himself by writing himself into the book? how corny. i probably wont read anymore tyree. twice was enough for this lifetime and the one to come."
2,A Book for Young Adults,"I found it very hard to read this book. I do not recommend it for the average adult reader, nor the average teenage reader. It also had too much cursing for my tastes. I am hoping that Mr. Tyree's other novels are written more on the adult level."
2,Very disappointed!,"I read this book because I kept hearing how good it was. Some people even compared it to ""The Coldest Winter Ever"",(which I loved!). Tracy's character didn't really stand out that much to me. And the book was just boring. Where as Winter kept me on my toes and I never knew what she was going to do next, Tracy was predictable. All I have to say is I think this is my last Omar Tyree book I'll read because this isn't the first book I read by him and I didn't really enjoy them either."
2,Better luck next time...,"I anxiously awaited reading this book for some reason I cannot explain. The title made me reminisce about junior high and I remembered thinking that I was truly flyy, so in a fit of remembrance I purchased this book. What a let down. I did not enjoy the method in which the story was told, there was no character development, and it was quite obvious that this was a story written from the male perspective. Although I do not plan to read the other books (Do Right Man, For the Love of Money - What cliched titles!) I do hope that he continues to grow as a writer."
2,Was this girl really fly???????,This book kind of disappointed me. I mean I was expecting a little more. It was boring. I guess that it would be good for a young girl. But for some reason I was not feelin it.
1,One of the single worst books I've ever read.,"I thought this book was terrible, with nothing redeeming about it. First, there wasn't a single scene that was not preceded by a long description of everything the character was wearing (and by whom it was designed), from outfit to shoes to handbags to jewelry. And the book encompassed many, many scenes and many, many characters. Excrutiating. Second, the characters -- and their dialogue -- were so simplistic as to be insulting, and all of their (serious) problems were solved with less reflection than than a Brady Bunch episode. Finally, the main character was so shallow, so annoying, that she was hardly worth the 412 pages I had to endure to finish the book (and if I hadn't been stuck on an airplane, I wouldn't have). Stick to Trey Ellis or Bebe Campbell Moore and any of the many gifted writers out there, and spare yourself the torture."
1,Disappointed,"I was hoping for a window into middle class/urban African American life that would artfully describe the desires, fears, and choices that are part of this adolescent experience. Instead, Flyy Girl is jammed pack with flat characters, stilted dialogue, name brand fashion descriptions, and bland sex. While trying to be hip, the cookie cutter plot is really a bourgeois morality tale. I have to contrast Flyy Girl with other poignant and effective novels about growing up and it comes up short. I wish there were more works out there that would challenge stereotypes about African American adolescents, instead of confirming them. That being said, Flyy Girl has clearly been popular with younger readers. I just wish it was better; it seems like a missed opportunity."
3,Too Many Characters,"I could relate to the era in the book. The main character changed men (boys) like she changed underwear. It's a shame that sex has been reduced to such an act. I was very disappointed with her parents behavior. The first confrontation of Dave and Patti in the book, threw me. The next door neighbor, Keith was a tyrrant and his wife, Beth was a wimp. It was inevitable for Mercedes to choose the wrong path. I wished the author would of developed the college characters in detail because they were able to make a difference for Traci. I would recommend this book to a person between 18-25."
4,This book is my favorite!,"This is my favorite book because of the content. It is a great book that I think that every African American person (male or feamle) can relate to. I have read this book 3 times and I am still amazed at how good this book is. I think that the 80's was a good era to write about and this book is a good testament to how incredibly amazing Omar Tyree is as a writer. I also suggest you read ""For the Love of Money"", which is the sequel to this book."
3,it was o.k,"i brought this book because everybody was talking about how good flyy girl is. if you are still in high school and like to hear about how hot girls and boys were back in the 80's then this book is for you, but if you are like me and like books with drama that has twist and excitement then you probally wouldnt enjoy this book very much. but in all it wasnt too bad"
4,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed reading the book, but I must say that Omar Tyree could have left out the definitions of the slang used. Anyone reading this book should know what those words mean. He also did a lot in describing characters that were only around for that one sentence. Could have left that out also. But, overall, I enjoyed reading this book. It was very interesting and could show young girls the route not to take in life and with the boys. It would have been nice for Tracy to have paid some consequences for her actions, however. It does let you know that although you think your child would never do some of those things, you as a parent must think again and be more involved with your children and their friends."
4,I was once a Flyy Girl,"I was once a flyy girl and I was immediately drawn to the book. While I never had sex for money I have often put myself in bad situations in order to get money from men that I often felt owed me if they wanted MY time. Though the book is fictional, It truly applies to young woman who feel it's necessary to compromise themselves in oder to achieve what they believe to be ""status"". Like Karrine Stephans, a lot of young girls use their looks and bodies to get money but still expect to get respect which is really not possible. It is good piece of fiction that all young woman who are careening into that lifestyle should read and consider that all that glitters isn't always gold."
1,Had to put it down!,"I know i'm kinda late on this one, but if you haven't read this book yet, don't bother!.If you are over the age of 17 you won't be interested and if you are under the age of 17, you SHOULDN'T be interested.Only gave it 1 star because I had to rate it otherwise It would not have even warranted it.Didn't finish it."
2,For the adolescents,"This book, I think, is for the young heads. It's similar to the first reality fiction story written by one of my 6th grade friends when I first realized that come had a different spelling. I loved that story at that time, then I read it again 6 months later after reading about 10 novels and I thought ""How childish!"". Fly Girl, ""How childish!""; it's so immature. And the acquaintance who recommended this book to me, I now think of her as feebleminded and unintelligent. This book is really for the adolescents. Its not a poor written book or the worst one I've read, just not mature."
4,A Man Wrote this???,"To tell you the truth I read for the love of money then flyy girl and I could not believe a man wrote them I mean in flyy girl I was like ""What, how does he know our feelings"" and when I say our I mean women this book was really page turning I mean I am way far from being flyy I mean she lost her ____ at 13 I still have mine at 14 whoa this book was good but I still think Tracy should have waited and got over Victor"
3,A young girl in flight,"This is a coming of age story during the 80's baby! I liked that part, and how he described the gear we use to sport! Just hearing the title and thinking about the song makes me want to go hang out how we did in ""my day!"" LOL Dang am I that old!Tracy, the main character is as superficial as they come. She enjoys a twist of her newfound freedom since her parents separate and she has gone from hating guys, to loving them! She's all about fashion, and guys, nothing else seems to matter. It's a nice story maybe for younger girls and their moms in case you'll forgot what it was like. It was very detailed and honestly that got boring to me! I did like that she finally matured past being all engrossed in her looks, her gear, and her jealousy. Flat-backing is not how a real woman gets on ladies!"
1,Flyy ...,"This was a very dumb book! I guess it would be good for a teenager to read, but it was sooooooooooooooo dull and boring. The sequel was also very stupid. I think he could have done better. He is a great writer. To bad he wasted his talent on this book."
1,JUVENILE,I agree with some of the other one-star raters. This book was juvenile and poorly written. I couldn't even get through the book. I barely made it up to page 70. I can't believe there are actually so many people who rated this book with 4 stars or more. That is what made me want to read it...
2,It was not all that!,"Single Mom by Omar Tyree was not all that! It had some very interesting points but for the most part it was dry. I felt Denise was to uptight I wish she could have been just more relaxed. Camelia which is Denise's best friend, she was okay but she should have had a little bit more of a life. Walter Jr, oh god he sounded as if he was nerd or something Jimmy, & Dennis they were okay. Overall the book was a little to dry for me. However, I think Mr. Tyree has the potential so i am not going to give up on him yet and I am going to read his other materials before i draw a strong conclusion. I just didn't care for SINGLE MOM"
1,Queen of Hoochie Mama Stories!,"Flyy Girl is a deplorable waste of paper and ink! The female characters are too young and too dumb with little, if any self-esteem. They should be studying for classes, developing FRIENDSHIPS, participating in school activities, and enjoying growing up. For goodness sake, many are in middle school. I have been teaching for 27 years and children do not prostitute themselves for gold jewelry! The language of the characters is as bad as some of the music played on the airways. Omar, clean out your mouth, or at least the mouths of your characters. If you are truly trying to become a writer, you need to develop a writer's vocabulary instead of a sailor's!"
3,not what I thought,"This was one of those books that kept getting passed around from kid to kid. I was in the sith grade when I read this. My friend got it which ment I could read it next. When I finished it I was so dissapointed. This is a fully loaded written porn, nothing more. While all the other girls were rampading about this in the girl's restroom about how ""seductive"" Tracy was, I was more comcerned on why she never got STD's or got pregnant. This girl was having sex with everything that walks. Ever since she lost her virginty she was having sex with every male that ever came her way! At the end of the book we read a letter from Victor about how he was a slave to sex and only wanted to be with him and how she was waiting for him to get out of jail just so she can marry him. I will NOT read the second or third book to see what happens. M friend told me Yictor marries another girl which makes me happy. Tracy got what she wanted a little too much for me."
2,Just the same thing over and over.,"This was recommended to me by my students, along with True To The Game. I enjoyed the dialogue in the book which seemed very real. But the book was otherwise boring. Just boy after boy and outfit after outfit. It didn't seem to go anywhere.Good if it gets kids reading and talking, but I hope that they'll eventually graduate to something more worthy of their time.I'm trying The Coldest Winter Ever next.....hoping for something better."
2,Terrible,I thought this book was terrible. Tyree rambles way too much. He explored the minds of minor characters and it was just plain boring. I was very disappointed.
5,Flyy Girl,"This is a good book couldn't put it down. Omar Tyree is a great writter,I enjoy his books."
4,Good Book,"I enjoyed this book. I thought it was very interesting because Tyree gave us a complete background of Tracy's life which made the book more good. Baced on Tracy's background, I expected her to do some of the things ahe had done in her childhood. I mena the book is called Flyy Girl. Every girl wants to be flyy in her growing up. I definately look forward to the sequel of this book. I predict Tracy will end up not being as hot as she was in Flyy Girl. I definately expect her to be more mature about her decisions in life."
4,THIS BOOK IS OFF THE HOOK!!!!,I was just writing to tell all of you how much i like this book. First of all this book has evrything you want in a book. First off it has drama but at the same time you learn something through it all. I was reading this book but it was some one elses on so i went to alot of book stores to find it but i never did until like 2 months later but when i did i was so happy. This book is so clever and fun!! if you ar looking fo a good book you've found the right book Flyy girl is the right choice.peace and luv ;)
3,Flyy Girl,"The item was alot older than the seller said it was, however a book is a book and I'm sure its good."
3,Flyyy Girlll,"This book is'nt as good as The Coldest Winter Ever. I like the way Tracy tried to betta herself towards the end of the book. I disliked the way she was to loyal to Vincent(that's his name ,right?) I read this book awhile ago. I heard that the sequal to this book is corny."
4,Flyy Girl By: Omar Tyree,"Worth Your TimeFlyy Girl written by Omar Tyree is a very good book about a young girl growing up and being introduced to boys, what they want, and the world of of sex which is something she was not exsposed to. she absolutly hates her father and trys to overule him in many ways. Flyy Girl is a book worth reading because it keeps you hooked and interested and in someways reminds many people of themselves."
4,THE GAME IS REAL,FLYY GIRL WAS GOOD IT SHOWS HOW THE YOUNG GRIL IN THE HOOD VIEWED THE DRUG DEALERS AND THE MAJOR PART A DRUG DEALER PLAYS IN SOME OF OUR HOODS THE BOOK KEPT IT REAL I LIKE IT A LOT
1,...i thought i would actually like it...,"At first I have to say I was really into this book. As a teenaged girl myself I could relate to alot in it. But the whole ""sister soldier"" thing was not all necessary. I mean its good to be a proud black woman but there was no need to go into the whole ""the man"" phase. Heck I thought that even the sequel would be better but after reading part of it i could tell it was gonna let me down..sorry wouldn't recommend it, it was more a waste of time"
2,The worst book written,This is about a girl name Tracy who basically is going through the ups and downs of being a teenager. When I started reading this book I thought it was o.k. As I got further into the book I wasn't enjoying it at all. Tracy is such a slut. Every guy that she approaches she has sex with. The story wasn't realistic. I wouldn't recommend this book at all.
2,COULD NOT FINISH IT,"When I first began to read this book, it really captured my attention. However, as I continued reading about Tracy (the main character) I noticed the scenarios kept repeating themselves. It seemed like Omar got stuck like a broken record because the story wouldn't really move on. Unfortunatley I did not finish the book and returned it to the library. (I did sneak and read the last page). I still want to read Mr. Tyree's other books and hope they are more readable than Flyy Girl."
2,A little sumpthin sumpthin for the jitterboppers!,"This book could get the average teen hooked on reading but it's not for the average adult that wants to read a good novel. I understood the plot but Tracy, her parents, and her brother just really got on my nerve. They had too much drama for me compared to Raheema's family with the abusive father and rebellious sister. Tracy and her family were just downright dysfunctional. I didn't really like this book. Maybe the next book, Omar!"
1,Highly Disappointing,"I wish that I could get a refund! It was a struggle to read this book. Maybe if I was 12 it would have been more interesting due to fact that the majority of the book was about a 13 year old female engaging in a series of sexual encounters. Overall, the book was boring and lacked creativity and development. This will most likely be the only book that I will purchase by this author."
1,"Banal, shallow, and preachy","Overall, a very disappointing book. The prose was simplistic- most of the sentences had the same boring structure. Tyree wrote a lot of words, but he didn't say much. The characters were superficially developed using primarily descriptions about skin color and stereotypic characteristics. Tyree describes Tracy as an intelligent girl but everything she does and says indicates that she is stupid. Victor is supposed to be worldly and wise according to the Tracy, but he ends up in jail blaming everyone else for what his own actions. At the end, it got preachy when Tyree began to proselytize (through Tracy's character) about what it is to be black and how crime, drugs, and sex relate to that. This was both annoying and insulting.This book was clearly not of the same caliber as recent books by E. Lynn Harris, April Sinclair, and many of the others written by comtemporary African-American authors."
4,DAG dis book is good,aight dis book really good i mean dag but i still feel that the coldest winter ever was kinda better but still i like this book and no offense but i like that he explained stuff and that he described details and things based on the point in time...this book is really good and i am looking foward to readin the sequalpeace
2,Over-rated to no end,"For those of us who enjoy Black fiction, this book falls way short. The word on the street is that this is a great book. Sure it is, if you are a teenaged Black girl. The thing I enjoyed the most about the book was how it reminesced of the 80's. Mostly dialogue and not much insight given by the author."
3,relate,I read this book thinkin it was goin to be like my favoirite book coldest winter ever.It shows you the struggle of first time mistakes and makes you relate yourself or to someone you know in your life. I did not care for the ending because Victor was the player of them all then all of a sudden he needs Tracy at the end and they never real said if they wee to together.anyway read it andsee!
5,~ I LOVE THIS BOOK~,I love this book. It's so true to life and I can totally relate to it. I grow up in Chicago...and this type of stuff is what I deal with. I can't find many books that makes it feel as if i'm a character in the book and i'm looking down on Tracy. You watch her grow up and transform into a woman and I like the whole concept. This book is good as hell and I love it...I wish there were more books that we're about inner city life!
4,I think this book took teens to another level.,This book has a lot of vulgar language and sexual acts but I think it is good for teens so they can see the mistakes this girl Tracy made and stop themselves before they make the same mistakes. One thing I liked about this book was that there is at least one character in this book that reminds you of someone you know!
4,Riveting,"The action in this book takes you from China, into California, Kansas, Arizona, and Colorado. The lives of many people change forever when they meet Ben and Su Chang as they settle in Kansas, and are running from Chinese warlords and the Tong of the Black Hand. There are kidnappings, murders, and rescues. It brings the Old West vividly back to life."
4,Adventure from China to Kansas,"I thought that this was a very good book. It will appeal to western enthusiasts, history buffs (although it's fiction), and general readers. I thought that there was some similarity to Louis L'Amour by the descriptive train of thought throughout the book.All in all, it was quite entertaining, and I will be very happy when the next two installments come out. I look forward to reading them soon.Mr. Frazier gets my vote as a good and entertaining author."
1,Cats already bored with it.,I thought this would be a great interactive toy for my cats. The balls that come with the box are too small and it took my cats all of 2 seconds to get them out. Now I just have a empty swiss cheese looking box in the middle of the room. Even when I try to replace it with larger toys they get them out too easily. Waste of my money.
2,The Cat Doesn't have to be too Smart,"I just bought 2 Peek-and-Play Toy Boxes from Tree House Humane Society, Chicago, IL, for a few foster cats. The construction is great. The smooth edges are suberb. The problem I have with them (and would not recommend to anyone) is that the side holes are too large. The toys/balls/etc. come right out especially the balls that come with the game. The cat doesn't have to work at all hard to get them out nor is there a way to keep batting the balls around the box for continued play. It's a little bit of fun, I guess, to paw out the treats inside but that's about it. Too bad."
2,Entertained them for about ten minutes,"I put the included balls in it and a cat nip toy. My cats went right after it big time. Two of them were pulling the cat nip toy back and forth towards each other. Well that lasted about ten minutes and now it sits. I'll stow it away and bring it out from time to time.To occupy your cat for longer and for a lot less money get one of the food distribution ballsPetSafe SlimCat Food Distributor Ball, Blue"
4,Must rev up the rewards!,"Wonderful toy. Kid D got bored with it, but as he's food motivated, I give him ALL his treats in the box - and often his kibble! Amazing to see his dexterity! He can ""palm"" a small piece of kibble from anywhere in the box!"
3,"overpriced, cats not intrigued for long","I bought this within the last month at CVS for $6.99 so this item is definitely overpriced on Amazon. Even so, both of my cats were very curious when I put it out for them to play with. They are 3 and 5 and both seem to like it fairly well for short periods of time. As others said, it's very easy for them to get the toys out but if it were more difficult I doubt they'd try for long (they are only cats...)."
3,Not so interested,"I was disappointed to see that my kitty did not show much interest in the box after quickly figuring it out after several tries. Although I was for sure she would go bollistic, because she is a very active Abbysinian. However, she does take action when I leave her treats in the box, she would quickly scoop them out, but not spend hours on it puzzled like I had hoped for. I hope others better luck."
5,NEVER ENDING FUN!!,MY TWO BENGALS LOVE THIS TOY. I PUT TREATS IN IT AND THEY TRY TO GET THEM OUT. THE BALLS COME OUT EASILY BUT THE TREATS ARE MORE CHALLENGING. IT IS STURDY AND WELL BUILT. I WISH IT WAS TWICE AS BIG.
3,"Good idea, not sure if cats enjoy","So, my cats are home most of the day while I'm at work. I wanted to get them something to play with beyond just their little toys. I thought this would be fun because I could hide treats plus their favorite toys & it would entertain them for at least an hour. I put this thing down filled with their toys & within 1 minute (possibly less) they had all of their toys out of it & were not interested. So, on the one hand, they seem to like the 1-2 minutes of ""hunting"" to get the toys out, however it's not an extended time of play."
1,cat toy,Useless. My cat removed all objects with ease no matter what the size and showed no further interest. No challenge whatsoever.
1,Cat could care less about it...,Waste of money and cat is bored by the whole thing- I might as well throw it away.
4,Pleasantly pleased,"Although our five cats played more with it during the first few weeks, they still check it out and continue to play as I change out the toys every so often."
4,Will Work for Treats,"I bought this for my very active 9 month old domestic medium-hair kitten. He had the toys out in mere minutes, which was disappointing, and went off to climb the drapes. However, when I give him his crunchy treats in the box, it takes him a few minutes longer to get the pieces out and snack on them. (Better than wolfing the treats down in a few seconds.) I was very happy to see my 13-year-old Ragdoll express an interest in this toy, and she will play with it every few days, fishing out the toys and sometimes the treats, too. I plan to rotate this with their other ""big"" toys to keep up their interest.I did accidentally step on the Peek-And-Play box in the dark, and it held up to the weight of an adult human! So thumbs up for sturdiness."
1,No Interest Whatsoever,"I gave this to my parent's cat who's normally very playful. Unfortunately, she barely sniffed it before ignoring it completely."
2,Order the bigger one,Cats were fascinated initially but it was too easy to reach their toys. Order the bigger one - cats need a challenge.
1,Not what was expected,"The product looks much like it appears in the picture. However, the feel of the loveseat is rather poor. It is hard and itchy. Furthermore, it requires a foolish amount of time to build. It is not simply that there is some remedial assembly required. I had to all but appolster the couch. It was a very difficult assembly, with poor directions. I would not recommend this product for the value.Frank"
5,Fantastic! Hooray for Wally Lamb!,"I am a huge fan of Wally Lamb, and even though he didn't actually write these stories, I can see how effective his guidance was in the women who did. I really appreciate these women for telling their stories, and I hope that Mr. Lamb will try for a sequel to this book."
3,not a sob story,"courageous women, I get it but I could not read the whole book. I understand the premise of giving them a voice and possibly a future but real real downer to read."
3,Very Interesting,I read this book after I fell in love with Lamb's writing in both Shes Come Undone and I Know this Much is True. It's a different side to Lamb but I really did enjoy it. Makes you thankful for the little things in life.
2,was not that enamored,"Let me start off by saying I love anything Wally Lamb writes. He is a great writer--but this book was not that interesting. I have always been intrigued with womens prisons and reading about ""their story"", but honestly the stories I read were about alot of females who would not or possibly could not take personal responsibility for their crimes. They quickly seemed to describle troubled childhoods and upbringing and then indirectly blamed it on that as reasons for committing pretty terrible crimes. Men do the same thing but I thought women would be a little more forth coming about their actions."
3,Very real,Pretty good book about very real people. Many people do not understand or take time to understand the lives of women prisoners. This book made me realize that things had to have happened in the past to make these women commit the crimes that they did. I would recommend it.
5,Never stereotype,"After reading this book, we have to be reminded that not everyone in prison is a bad person, although all have done bad things. All of the stories were heartwrenching, but one of the most disturbing was Diane Bartholomew's. What she must have endured during her marriage to an physical, mental and sexual abuser. These stories were haunting and very moving. We all have a testimony, but these women shared them with all who would read them. Powerful reading."
4,Moving and insightful,"I didn't realize that I wasn't getting a new Wally Lamb novel when I picked this up from the library, but after reading it I was not disappointed at all. This is a collection of short stories from women who have been sentenced to prison for various crimes. These are emotional and insightful stories from women who have suffered unspeakable abuse.Each story stands on it's own, is well told and moving. I admire Wally Lamb for working with these women. And I see that he has another collection similar to this one due out September 2007. I will be reading that book as well."
5,Wonderful stories,"I am really enjoying this book. I have read other Wally Lamb books so I decided to buy this one, which is a collaboration of female prison inmates' stories. They are both fascinating and tragic and it has made me more open minded about people's lives and circumstances. I recommend this book."
3,Ok read,I had to read the book for class and I thought that is was good but I wouldnt read it for anything other than class.
1,Why I am angry that I bought ___Couldn't Keep It To Myself,"Wally Lamb is my very favorite author. I am anxiously awaiting publication of his next novel. Since it hasn't been finished, I bought""Couldn't Keep It To Myself"" thinking it would be if not great, at least inspirational. I hated the book. (And I read most of it.) Thousands of people have very bad experiences in their lives but they are able to overcome them and do good things.Why the need to recognize people who committed crimes? For me this book was no different from VH1's ""Music Behind Bars."" Unless you have a soft spot for criminals, don't buy this book."
5,A wonderful book!,"I read this captivating collection during me senor year of high school, and i wish that it would be on the required reading list. Coming from a very homogeneous school, it was enlightening to read about people with experiences so different from my own. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs a dose of reality, or just a reason to further appreciate the blessings in their life."
5,The real deal,"Wally Lamb's students tell the story of prison life as it really is...no doubt helped by great writer to put it into words more effectively, but they must have the talent to tell a story without too much help. We need more programs like this in our prison system--Thanks to Wally Lamb and the amazing women at York Correctional. I hope they inspire our sisters not to repeat their mistakes."
5,Awesome book!,"This book was well worth the read! I work in a woman's prison so I found this very interesting. I enjoy my job very much--which explains the 26 years that I have been there-so this book just gave me more insight to the prisoners.If you are in amy department of the legal or prison system, this is a great book!"
5,WOW,"Really nice earcuff look so sexy I made a mistake and buy only one now I know how material and how lookreturn for more , very happy costumer and they have the best costumer service too , come on time I recoment this product if you want to see so sexy"
4,"Good, but not perfect","It's a great encyclopedia, but here's a couple of suggestions on how to make it even better...1) Next to each entry, put in phonetics or some sort of pronunciation guide. People would like to sound intelligent when they speak too, not just when they read.2) Wine Region maps should be colored, not just black & white.3) Grape varieties should have nice colored pictures next to them."
4,"Great book, but not what I expected","The book is definitely like a dictionary - all terms and wines are listed alphabetically. It is very informational, but I was hoping for more pictures and whatnot."
5,A Most Incredible Wine Reference Book,"This book is truly incredible and can best be described as an encyclopedia of wine. Printed on 816 pages of fine paper with sporadic full color photographs and pencil drawings, it is atypical of other books on wine. There no novice section, stemware identification guide or chapter on building your own cellar. This is the book you want in you hands to aid in locating those rare areas of production and defining little known terms. Robinson draws on approximately 150 contributors, highly qualified experts in their respective fields, to author select entries.Joseph Broski (Dionysian Society International)"
4,Part of book missing,"While I've found the book book very informative and helpful, pages 601-624 are missing. I guess I shouldn't complain though, since I have pages 625-648 twice. Has anyone else noticed this in their 3rd edition? I can't believe mine is the only copy where this mistake has occurred."
4,Massive Encyclopedia!,"Great wine anthology and info. Wonderfully written and properly annotated. My only complaint would be that it is not easy to know where to start in this book if you are a complete beginner, as it's not easy to know where to start in the world of wine.One of my best purchases!"
5,The 3rd Edition and the Best Yet!,"I will keep this brief. This is the holy grail of wine knowledge. There is no finer reference that covers as wide a range of topics as this. My favorite part of this text is that other covered topics within a story have highlights so that you can flip to a new, related topic and expand your knowledge, much like a hyperlink on the web.I am a Master of Wine student and this is indespensible. Buy this first then grab the World Atlas of Wine and the Sotheyby's Wine Encyclopedia. These are the three books that should be the cornerstone of any wine library."
4,THE wine encyclopedia,"search anything about wine? it's there. Just great, very accurate and up-to-date. The only disadvantage in my view is that for complete information about some subjects you have to follow refences throughout the book. On the other hand is that a great way to browse it.In all respects a book worth recommending!"
4,Wine snob?,"The Oxford Companion to Wine, 3rd EditionBought it as a gift, fairly certain I've just created another budding wine snob. But at least he'll be able to be authoritative!"
5,The OED of viticulture ...,"This behemoth covers ""A""bboccato to ""Z""infandel (actually Zweigelt) and every facet in between. As multi-layered as a fine wine itself, the OCTW is one reference you will neither tire of nor outgrow."
2,not easy to use,a lot of useless words inside ant too little focus on the main things the descriptions are quite narrow especially on the grape varieties
3,Not enuf stuff,"Though I've hardly read the entire tome, my quick reaction is that I'm missing being able to look up specific wines from specific vineyards. Only select and generally quite famous wines and vineyards are mentioned and even with those, we are not told which vintages are special or to be avoided. A lot of money for a text book that is not a consumer's guide."
5,Must-have and great present,"VERY good book, I use it very often, and it offers full and interesting information about many things connected to wine - grapes, regions, pruning, climat, etc.Very good professional book for a long pleasant use. To be honest this edition can replace many wine-educational books, because you can find practically everything written with clear nice language, very understandable."
2,great smell to kill the smell of cats and litterbox,for a human to wear this you'd have to be a pig farmer or dirty old man with false teeth. Great odor killer for the cat litterbox or if a skunk is nearby but for a human -- I'd look elsewhere. Maybe for the Hunchback of Notre Dame its' ok or a dirty frenchman its fine.
5,Great Scent Great Price,"I've been using this product for years but never found a price like this. Great Scent, Great Price. Thank you for the good deal."
5,Great fragrance,"Each skin has to match up with a fragrance from this large market , this one is great for night."
2,"Harsh, loud, and barbaric smell","This is as impolite and harsh a fragrance could get. The opening is a blast of coarse and LOUD smell of chemicals. I cannot think of an occasion where this would do me any good.There are some scents that are priced low, and yet smells very good (Quorum, for instance). But this is unmistakably bad smelling, I gave this bottle away.NOT recommended."
5,Used in ESL class. Delightfully creative play.,"Fun remake of the Tom Sawyer whitewashing story. This play is for ESL instructors and students who want to do an energetic project. The Wall will encourage and lead students towards their goals without intimidation. A rich sampling of the english language is masterfully woven into a wonderful new tale, yet is simple enough to delight students of all abilities."
3,New formula,"This product is not banned in Canada. It's on the shelves of every drug store here. I've been using it for the last couple of years. It works as it promises.At any rate, the formula has been changed recently. Among other alterations, it no longer contains lead acetate. I can't speak to the effectiveness of the new formulation yet."
1,Use with Extreme CAUTION,"Yes, this product will color your hair. Whether it is safe or not is another question entirely. The product contains lead acetate. From my research on the web, this ingedient is a known carcinogen, and therefore Grecian Formula has been banned for sale in Canada and the European Union. I personally used Grecian Formula for over 3 months. I experienced excruciating and persistent headaches until I made the connection to the use of Grecian Formula as the source of my problem. If you use this product and experience headaches, STOP USING IMMEDIATELY!"
4,"Surprisingly, it works","I wouldn't thing the stable of recording artists who participated could make this work, but it does. Believe it or not, my favorites are those by Blondie, Sting and someone we don't hear enough of, Filippa Giordano (listen to her sing the theme from Lost Boys 2)"
4,VERIFIED,I first heard this CD on our local Afrikaans radio station and was immediately excited by the choice of music on the CD. I would highly recommend this CD to anybody who enjoys classical alternative music.
3,"good projector, but no optical zoom and low resolution","This is a good product. I especially liked the design and convenient menu. Very easy to use and good picture quality. Two things I did not like about this projector: (1) no optical zoom and (2) only 800by600 resolution. This is not a problem if you plan to place the projector close to the screen, such that your image is not very large. In my case I wanted to project images on a wall in my living room (which is about 14 inches long) and mount the projector next to the opposite wall. It did not work. The image size was huge and the image quality was not so good. I could see separate pixels and it was very annoying. You can decrease the image size digitally, but it does not improve the image quality.I ended up returning this projector and ordering Epson Powerlite 76C LCD instead. Couldn't be happier. 76C has all the same features + 1024by768 resolution and optical zoom. Definitely worth additional $250!"
4,"Great projector, impressed","If you have any reservations about buying a projector, this one will change your mind.I bought this projector for a starter ""workout"" room in my home, since I had no floor space for a TV. The Pros: picture is sharp, colors are great, and it works well, cheap bulbs, fairly quiet. The Cons: a bit of screendoor effect (all LCDs do this), no DVI/HDMI, digital keystone correction. The keystone is no big deal if you can mount it close to the viewing height. I've tried it out with the XBox and it works great for games too (no blurring). The high resolution puts this projector a leg above some of the other units costing over $1000. It has much better color than the DLP projectors, and it doesn't have ""rainbow"" problems."
4,Great Product,"This is my first projector. I am very please with this product. I used a white window blind/curtain which does not allow light to come in, I think they call it a 'darkened' curtain. That was a cheap way to use the projector towards my sliding door. I also use velcro to hold it in place, and therefore it can be taken down easily. Great projector overall. 29 Sept. '05.(...)"
5,Great book of western patterns,I am really happy with this book. I own many scroll saw books and this is one of my favorite ones. Lot's of easy patterns as well.
2,"Thought It Was A Bird, But.......","I got this CD and listened to it last night. I really wanted to like it, but it was a chore getting through it. The arrangements are claustraphobic and tense. Even beautiful songs like ""Slow Like Honey"" and ""Paper Bag"" sound dark and depressing. I don't think I will be listening to this one much. The first song has a drum machine on it, and there is occasional bass, but it is mostly one violinist and one cellist who overdubbed multiple parts. They need to open up the arrangements, so they breathe instead of being so stifling."
2,Mediocre Dovetail is Better than None,The fit of the parts is not of great quality. There is only one router base bushing even though there are three different template sizes. There are no size specifications for the different templates nor are there adequate setup directions.
1,ugh,needed it for a religion claas that I am forced to take and pay for. nothing like paying to have others religion shoved down my throat
5,This is a Good Video!,"I live in Las Vegas. I bought the video to send to my Mom who is coming out to visit shortly. I wanted to give her an idea of things she could do when she gets here. Before I sent it to her, I decided to watch it. It was quite amazing! This video is a wirlwind tour of all the newest and biggest hotels on the strip. What I really liked about it was that it highlighted something unique about each hotel. For example, it showed the Knights of the Roundtable at Excalibur and the StarTrek experience at the Hilton. It also showed all the surrounding areas including Hoover Dam, The Grand Canyon and even a blimp flight over the strip including incredible aerial shots of the Bellagio fountains. There's even a gunfight from the ghost town of Oatman, AZ. on the video. The quality was very good and as far as I could tell it was right up to date."
4,"Worth the [money], but could be better.","I bought this video to help plan my vacation to Las Vegas. I was looking mostly for information about hotels and attractions along the strip. This video provided a good, but brief, introduction to the features of all the major hotels along the strip. I was pleased that they also covered a number of attractions outside the strip. Unfortunately, I felt they spent too much time on some very minor attractions, such as the Harley Davidson Cafe. I would have preferred that more of that time be spent on giving more information on the strip hotels and on the Fremont Street Experience."
3,Basic stretching for 23 min,"This is just Victoria alone doing basic stretching, not even yoga. It is done in a soothing, flowing way to increase grace & body awareness, but no spiritual terms or new age, etc. She speaks about which muscles are used & stretched & she tells you often how to modify for everything. Basic plies, lunges, torso stretches to the side, reclined & seated stretches. It's only 23 min for the actual workout & probably filmed in the '90s w/professional quality."
5,good stretching video,Its basically a good stretching video. My plan for this video was to use it after exercise and before I go to bed. The video is a little over 20 min and I am cool with that
4,fast shipping,I surprised this for a friend who was going to give it for her kid!! Thanks for being so fast
2,Graphic SF Reader,"I Wish That I Had Duck Feet is about a kid daydreaming about what he could do if he various differen abilities or talents, including the whacky one of wanting to have duck feet.This might be handy to have swimming, but not so hot for running around the park or riding your bike."
5,A favorite,"This was my book when I was a kid (many years ago). My child has loved this book since age 2, and still loves it at age 4, and he knows every word by heart.The story is all about applying one's imagination.However, at a deeper level it stimulates critical thinking. First, the main character imagines a scenario and all of the benefits (say, having deer horns on his head). Next, he goes on to consider all of the pitfalls. Good life skills here!There is some level of bullying from his antagonist. I'll confess to skipping some related sections when my boy was 2, since he had no concept of 'meaness', but at 4 he knows full well that not everyone plays nice in this world.Another triumph for the good Mr. Geisel incognito."
5,Cute and imaginative!,A friend gave my three-year-old this book for Christmas because her four-year-old liked it so much. It has become a favorite! My daughter loves the words AND the pictures. The message of being happy with yourself is a good one too.
4,"""I wish I had duck feet""","""I wish I had Duck Feet"" written by Theo Le Sieg, is an exceptional peice of children's literature. Not only is this book entertaining, it has a morale. Children need to understand that they are special just the way they are and this book gives an imaginative way to demonstrate that to a child. The only reason I would give this a four star rating instead of a five star rating is because the main character tends to pick on or try and find ways to bully another child. It seems though that it is out of revenge, but still I think it would have been a better book if the relationship between the two character would not have been included. Overall this book is a great read for children and I would strongly recommend it."
2,"No more Madonna remakes, please!!!",The only reason this records even gets TWO stars is because the song itself is spectacular. I'm a huge Madonna fan and shreiked loudly when I heard this remake.The original is timeless and this remake is untimely. Buy the original if you want this song.
1,A complete disaster,"This is the best way to put it. All this is, is Black Legend's ""You See The Trouble With Me"" mixed up with Madonna's ""Like A Prayer"". A horrible concept on paper but its even worse in reality. This Mad House cash cow has no shred of originality or artist integrity. The fact that this was Top 3 in Germany depresses me because at one point their trance, techno and hi-nrg scene's were amazing. If you're too young to remember Madonna's version, I urge you to check out the single best pop tune of 1989, and if you're in need of a house tune check out the Black Legend track. Avoid at all costs."
3,GREAT Cheese at its best,"This one is a commercial give-me. If you are a DJ and are feeling the crowd fighting you back perhaps cos you're on a limb playing really great Trance, house and progressive, and the crowd you're dealing with is as commercial as... well you know, this is the song to bring happiness to all those who say to you... ""PLEASE PLAY SOMETHING I KNOW WITH WORDS IN IT"" without annoying the learned crowd (too much).So if you are a mobile DJ doing a wedding and want to seem ""hip"" pop this one out and let it play.I play it in some of my gigs, because it is a song everyone SHOULD recognize. AND IT DOES HAVE GREAT ENERGY.I did not give it more stars because like someone else here mentioned, ""there is nothing original about this song"" except one thing they did not mention, IT APPEALS TO THE M-..."
3,A guilty pleasure from my side...,"The first time I heard this cover, I really, *really* thought it was horrible. And I still do to a certain point. But I've also grown fond of it. I still the vocals are pretty lame, but with summer and all, I know that this song is going to be a reminder of sunshine when the winter comes...so yeah I like it, even though I'm a bit ashamed of it. Just don't forget that Madonnas original version of this song is pure pop joy!"
3,Love's Old Country Music,WHAT NO SONG LIST???????????? Some of us would like to know what on this CD before we buy it you KNOW!!!!!!!!!
5,"Top of the line ""Two-Fer""","Most two episode tapes contain one classic and one sleeper. This is an exception. ""To Serve Man"" is the ultimate tale of where laziness and self-glorification can get you, and ""Judgement Night"" is a plain old shivers-down-the-back story of final payment coming due. Excellent combination."
5,Beautiful!,"I know this album is meant for babies, but it is just as soothing for adults. After a long, stressful day adults can use this sweet, light-hearted melody to coddle the mind and soul."
3,Nice starter set for a new fan of Sibelius,"I recommend you buy a few of the symphonies separately. The Pohjola's Daughter and En Saga plus Finlandia is what you get here. Buy it used for a few dollars. It is not poorly put together.Naxos themselves have newer recordings of many of these works now. The recording method has improved. See New Zealand Symphony.The orchestral parts you can discover in full editions. You also get a few songs and smaller pieces. They are not often recorded in connection with his major works.If you just want the Tone Poems, some of the tracks here plus Tapiola are found on a related disc:Tone Poems"
4,Great for the money,"I picked this amp on impulse. I lead worship at my church and have wanted to start switching between electric and acoustic. I needed something small, and not too loud, with decent tone. All in all, I am happy. It has one of the best clean tones I have heard from an amp in the $100-$300 range. Even though it is a hybrid, the clean sound still gets that chimey tube sound. Each note comes through as distinct.The dirty aspect of the amp is achieved by punching the gain selector button. It's good up to about 10' o clock on the dial, then it gets too muddy. I am happy with that though, since I am not trying too achieve too much in the dirty range, just a good smooth overdrive.For my purposes this is a great deal. I am sure it's not for everyone though. I will eventually switch out the tube for something else. The amp picks up a bunch of the low end, so I might try to find something that helps out there. I'm to any kind of tubes in my amps, so I could just be ignorant."
3,Not what I was looking for - not bad for what it is,"I was looking for a small tube amp and it is small, however it is not clean passed about 3-4. The actual tube was stuck with some waxy red material to the shell that protected it. After a call to Kustom they said it should just pop right off, but it didn't and I wasn't going to attempt to pull it anymore than I did because if I did I would have broken the tube. I ultimately sent the amp back. I wanted something cleaner so dirt at 3-4 wasn't what I wanted. I didn't use it for longer than a few minutes because the tube had that waxy goo on it that wouldn't come off. I gave the amp a rating of 3, which is average. I did not find this amp excellent because of the dirt in the sound at 3-4 and the fact that the tube was stuck to the protection shell that surrounded it. Amps are subjective and as such this amp may work for you, but it didn't for me."
4,A good guide,"It's a good guide. There were lots of illustrations, which is why I bought it to begin with. It could have used more from Jim Burns though."
4,fun stuff,"I loove the Uplift universe (really galaxies, not the entire universe, but whatever). This is an excellent guide book to the series, fleshing out previously-introduced races and providing new information on others. However, DO NOT read this book until you have read Startide Rising, The Uplift War, and Sundiver. Contacting Aliens contains spoilers to the conclusions of those books.One thing, I hope a second edition of this comes out, because there are a few little errors/contradictions in it."
2,Few will enjoy this,"...Brin's uplift novels are overloaded with wonderful details that lets the reader's mind co-create aliens and alien landscapes. He provides just enough information to evoke a sense of weirdness with his aliens that they become full fledged beings all on their own. His aliens are, for the most part, shockingly original and often disturbing in just how un-human they can be. In Contacting Aliens imagination and originally have been surgically removed leaving us with aliens as two dimensional as the artwork that accompanies their brief description. What a disappointment. The book neither fills in holes left by the series nor adds new ground or information to these characters.The drawings appear rather juvenile and provide no depth or interest. They contribute nothing to the image of the exotics that populate Brin's novels..."
3,For lack of trivial pursuit I can&#65533;t get no satisfaction,"For someone who loves the Uplift universe and the books this is some fun, a mind-teaser but also an annoyance because of the pictures. Having read all of the Uplift novels I have a distinct mental picture of the relevant alien races and I guess that is true for most of the fans.For someone who doesn't know the novels this book must be quite bewildering - especially because of the pictures. So the only use I foresee for this book is if there is a ""Trivial Pursuit - Uplift Universe Edition"", then it will be essential. Other than that I agree with others reviewers (and quote the Stones): I can't get no satisfaction either."
2,Seems less than normal,"I took this as a thermogenic, and it seemed to be more a placebo affect that actually useful aid in fat loss.It may work but I have taken other products and really feel a sweat build up just sitting still.I am no scientist so I have no records, just my personal experience."
3,diet aid,i used bitter orange tablet daily in combination with caffeinated beverage in hopes as weight loss supplement. walked 2-6mi daily as well as my usual routine while taking this supplement. i did not see any differnce in results as far as no more energy as usual and did not lose any weight.
4,ProGrip 900700 Cab Pad Roof Protector,User friendly isn't the what to say here AWESOME! Is what I say. I have used these Cab Protectors in multiple ways and they have not failed me yet and they still look New.
3,Gilded Reader,"Dave Duncan has created an incredible storyline. The idea is not that original: A king has rettainers known as blades, bound to serve with their life. The special powers they have to protect their ward in times of exigence is non-standard, but possibly a spinoff from legendary tales such as Beowulf. The novel lacks action, but when Duncan desides to infuse action, it is worth waiting for. One scene with blade Durendal and immortal Herat is quite dazzling. Durendal is a character to watch and is the most skilled of all blades, ostiensibly since the dawn of the Ironhall--the forge center for blades. The book is good, but oftentimes corny and melodram. Worth the paperback price, surely, but don't splurge on hardcover."
3,Dull Blades carve a sharp story.,"The Blades are bound by honor and a sacred magic to protect their king, but what happens when that very binding turns sour, when the sacred magic itself has been profaned and something contrary to Nature, both natural and supernatural, is served instead? Duncan covers interesting terrain in the Realm of Philosophy as well as telling a fine stand-alone fantasy tale.As a reader of many fantasy novels, I found the ""knights of the round setting"" dull and uninspiring, seen it so much, you know? But, the adventure Durendal takes to explore the brotherhood of Immortal Swordmasters contrasts the tawdry Teutonic setting with something completely alien and unique."
3,Misleading description for a good but not great read,"Read the above descriptions and you will be mislead as to what this book is all about. This is not an adventure tale, but a story of the life of a hero, Durendal, one of the kings bodyguards. As such it starts out interesting enough but kind of sags in the middle as whole decades are skipped over. Many of the most interesting characters are not adequately developed. Worst of all the 5 year Marco Poloesque journey to Samarinda is dismissed in a few paragraphs that briefly mention great adventures but no details are given.Too bad. There is much to admire here. The background is well crafted, similar enough to Medieval England to be familiar and the King is obvioulsy based on Henry VIII. The magic is tastefully understated and just different enough to make it interesting. The book is just too short! This is a life worth 2 or 3 books and the potential is never realized in this single volume. OK, but you can do better."
3,"Fun book, decent read","This book is worth your time, as good as or better than most fantasy novels out there."
3,Readable - but nothing special,"This book reminded me of an average Raymond Feist fantasy. If you don't have A CLASH OF KINGS on hand and want fantasy with little fantastic about it, you could do worse than this book. Of course, you could probably do better, too. The ethics-free nature of the society of Blades, warriors that live to serve regardless of morals, is a pretty poor group to bear the load of heroes for an entire book. These warrior are bound to do whatever their master bids them, whether dying to save their master, or killing people to serve their master for breakfast (literally). Lucky there are no Nuremburg Trials in this world! Of course, this is fantasy, but the book is slow enough that you think about things like this instead of being carried along with the action. I've read worse."
3,Boy makes good with a sword and common sense,"This book is the first in the 'King's Blades' series of novels. It is essentially a series of highlights in the life of the most famous of Blades, Sir Durendal. I found this book a disappointment in many ways. Durendal leads a life of adventure and success, but for all that you don't really feel that you know him that well by the end of the story.Another striking feature of the novel was how closely King Ambrose was modelled on the real King Henry 8th of England with access to magic. This book serves as an introduction to the Blades universe, but I'm not sure it's one that will make me follow through to read the other books in the series as for me this book was a curiously flat and uninvolving read into a distinctly boys-own world of swords and magic"
3,A little disappointed.,"For a long time I have read many fantasy novels by author's such as Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind, J.V. Jones, and George R.R. Martin. At picking up this book I was very excited hoping that it would be in the same ranks as those authors, but was severely disappointed to find that it did not hold up to my expectations. Most definately engaging, but not nearly as well written or played out as I have become used to."
2,Could have been better...,"This book is built around a interesting plot. Unlike other books in this genre, however, the author fails to create a believable world or even an interesting cast. I would suggest reading George R.R. Martin's books. He succeeds where Duncan falls short."
4,An enjoyable read,"I picked up this book after reading a lot of mixed reviews. I would have to agree with one person that their was a lot of good potential story line left unsaid, but the book was a stand alone so their was no waiting for the next one (or seven). I enjoyed the charecters and the action was well paced. It was a truly enjoyable read and will warrent me picking up the next installment of The King's Blades. I trully loved the concept of the binding. It is truly original."
4,A pleasant surprise...and a stand-alone novel!,"I hadn't read Dave Duncan up until now, but I received this book as a gift. I was expecting another saga of a scullion who grows up to discover that he's the warrior foretold in prophecy, blah, blah, blah. Instead, it's the story of a virtuous man living in troubled times, and doing his duty as honor binds him. The central theme of the King's Blades is different from most magic systems in fantasy novels, and the exploration of the concept was interesting. And I was especially pleased to discover that the novel stands completely alone; there's little room to return to this character in a sequel. However, I would certainly be interested in another novel of the King's Blades."
2,A disappointing story about a plausible character.,"When I first read the discription of this book, I thought that it would be an enjoyable read. The concept seemed to possess a story line that could introduce strong interesting characters. Unfortunetly the book did not live up to my expectations. At the beginning of the book we are only given a brief character development of the protagonist. From then on it is a sporadic jumble of ideas and images. We are never given images that seem to be developed, only diffuse imaginative thoughts and too numerous sub-plots. This is unfortunate because the main character would be someone who I would like to see in further adventures."
5,Excellent and well constructed yarn,An excellent swords and sorcery tale. Good plot with plenty of action. Good philosophical undertones. I look forward to more in the same setting.
4,Duncan's a great fantasist,"This is not Duncan's best work (that honor goes to his superb _Future Indefinite_), but that's okay, because even average Duncan is very, very good. As we'd expect in a work by the estimable Mr. Duncan, the setting is original, the characters interesting, and the plot exciting and unpredictable. Almost as nice in this era of never-ending series, the book is self-contained, and comes to a satisfying conclusion.In all, a most enjoyable read. Recommended.(In contrast to an earlier reviewer, I would not compare this to Goodkind at all; where Goodkind revels in hackneyed cliches and stock characters, Duncan always manages to create something wholly original.)"
2,Didn't Finish the Book,"While some of other Duncan's series took a while to hook me and I was used to the detailed way the stories developed in his other work, I couldn't get into this one. I had no problem putting this book down. In fact, I haven't picked it up since- a bad sign from a bibliophile like myself. I may finish it as I feel guilty for spending money and not reading it. The most interesting element I found was the character development of the main character and the story of the immortal warriors that fought with swords of gold which reminded me strongly of a dark fairy tale a la 1000 Arabian Nights. That section of the book was really interesting."
4,Laughter and learning makes quite the Bbook,"Okay, so I must admit... I'm not exactly an expert when it comes to understanding the scientific jargon used in most journals discussing epidemiology and other areas of interest. I love to read about the world around me, but sometimes need a translator to comprehend it all! That's the great thing about Arno Karlen's book, ""Biography of a Germ""-- you don't have to have your doctorate in microbacteriology to enjoy this book as a great read. On the surface the subject may seem a bit, well, odd... but Karlen's wit makes it easy to find yourself enthralled with the life and loves of Bb, this book's microscopic hero and hellion all rolled into one tiny spirochete. Before you know it, you are actually LEARNING a thing or two... and enjoying every minute of it! Far beyond just a crack at popular science, ""Biography of a Germ"" just might provide a few answers not only about the world within but the world around."
3,"Interesting, but superficial","This is undoubtly an interesting subject. Borrelia burgdorferi is an important pathogen and serve as a good model to explain some ways in which we have altered the environment and the resulting ecological consequences. Ecology and microbiology as the ecology of parasites in general are extremely important subjects we should all be conscientious and aware of. Particularly interesting is the ecological history of Borrelia burgdorferi and his vector.The reason I only gave three stars to this book is that I felt it is superficial. Arno Karlen does not explain intimate relations between Borrelia and Ioxodes, nor between Ioxodes and deer, he just mentions the relations between them, but do not explain intimacies."
4,The power of Love can make a new life.,"This is the deeply personal story of how Love changed one man's life. Scholars have tended to over-analyze the simple passion of the small book, which tells how from the age of nine (when he first saw her) Dante worshipped the beatific Beatrice. The force that the power of Love held over him caused him to adore her even after her death, and her name has been immortalized by his devotion."
1,Not for me,"I found these to be very uncomfortable. Maybe I have big ears and don't know it, but the cans did not fit over them and I had to return them. Very surprised, I love my plantronics headset for my cell phone."
1,"uncomfortable, poor quality","Not too happy with these. The worst part about these is the way they fit on your ear. The hard plastic on the inside of cup sorta sticks out and hits my ear. Just not comfortable at all. Can't wear them for very long.Sound is OK only. Nothing special.The headphone connector is already going out, after only about 4 months of rare use (cuz they hurt!). I have to play with the wire were it connects to the input to get the right sound.The mic seems ok, no problems with it."
2,Cable breaks very easily,"I just have it for a couple weeks and the first time I pulled from it the cable broke and there is no easy way to fix it. I had other brands of headsets and they have last me for years, but this one was extremely easy broken. I mean, the headset is fine but the part were the two cables join in one is not fuse so every time you pull by accident from them you are pulling on the inside cables.Therefore, extremely easy to break."
1,No front/rear sound.,I dont recommend these for 1st person shooter gamers.Impossible to tell if enemy is in front or behind you.Probably ok if direction of sound is not important to you.Left and right work ok but not front/rear for some reason.My hp laptop earbuds work better.
1,"Sound was okay, but microphone is not stable",I needed a new microphone headset to talk to my team on Ventrilo with various games that we like to play. On Ventrilo the microphone is so crazy. Moving the microphone a little bit causes it to sometimes make it so my teammates can't hear me or I'll be too loud. After hearing complaints for the last couple days I'm going to go back and return it to get different headset.
5,Great sound,"While they might not be the most comfortable headset in the world, they do deliver superior sound and crystal clear voice. People I chat with say they sound great. The volume/mute control is in a convenient location. The lower half of the microphone is bendable which is a very useful feature that a lot of other headsets seem to be leaving out. The cord is long enough to allow a good range of motion without yanking them off your head.They certainly aren't as comfortable as my earbuds. It would be nice if the ear pads rotated more (they only rotate about .25"") or were softer to achieve a better fit. Then again, could just be that I have sensitive ears.All in all, they are a solid product for a reasonable price. Another winner from Plantronics."
5,Great for the price,I have owned a pair of these for a few weeks now and have no complaints.The quality for a headset at this price is amazing. I use is for gaming at night so I don't wake anyone up and for Skype. The sound quality is great and the bass output isn't half bad. The Mic gives me no feedback and does dampen ambient noises around me. They feel a little cheap but they are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. This helps when playing a long session of Diablo II: LOD :)I recommend these for those who do not want to spend a lot of cash yet get get a quality product.
3,Overpriced and incomplete,"One would think that a book that continuously refers to geographic features and locations, archaic place names, native villages and encampments, and river miles above the mouths of the Columbia and Willamette rivers would include a map. Not so with this book. I found it extremely frustrating that this book did not include even one useful map. This would seem to be a monumental oversight by the author or editors, since it significantly detracts from the clarity and accessibility of the subject matter. I finally attempted to annotate several USGS quad maps so that I could get my bearings (This made it somewhat difficult to read the book on the bus or the train). I grew up in the area Rubin writes about, and even so, I definitely could have used a map. Were the publishers trying to save money? Save yours, and check the book out from the library if you are interested (luckily, that's what I did). Oh, and get a good map while you're at it."
4,Just like I remember,I start looking for these in stores and could not find them. They are just as I remember from when I was growing up.
3,you better buy two...,"Look, this book is absolutely fantastic. Five stars at least for the material.However, the binding of the book is so poor that it falls off the spine after 2 viewings. Inexcusable!"
5,The title says it all....almost,"If you often enjoy a glass of wine with your dinner and want some simple and healthy meals perfectly matched with your wine, this book is for you. Everyday Dining isn't touted as a ""healthy"" or ""diet"" cookbook, yet Andrea's recipes are often low-fat or slimmed down versions of classic foods. Lowering the calories and keeping it simple both translate to dishes that are realistic for weekday dining. Another feature is that she gives several alternative wines for pairing with the dish, so you don't feel locked down to wines you don't have or can't find. The wines are also fairly common so if you want to match her suggestions verbatim, you can. The book is full of interesting wine tidbits as well as full wine-themed menus when you really want to impress your guests. All-in-all, there is a lot going on in this book."
3,SOLARY PROSTATE DEFENSE,FOUND A BETTER PRODUCT AND AM UING IT.THE NEW PRODUCT I'M USING IS CALLED PROSTAPRINWOULD RECOMMED THE NEW PRODUCT I'M USING
4,"Watch out, homies, for Santa's Swingin' Sack.","L.A. based Radio station KROQ releases a Christmas CD every year, hosted by deejays Kevin & Bean. This was the 1998 release. It features a mix of Christmas songs and comedy routines. Most of the songs are good and most of the comedy bits are funny. Several of the tracks are only available on this CD, so it's well worth seeking out."
3,Another calorie counter???,"Gosh, my first impression about seeing this book was ""How many calorie counting references does one need?""The book could be useful for a ""nutrition library""I just happen to have 2 books in the ""Eat This, Not That"" series."
1,"If you're monitoring saturated fats, don't look here","Most food count books list fat content. I expected a fat count book to do more -- to separate saturated fats from non-saturated fats, and maybe even list mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated fats as well. These key facts are not included."
3,Great Buy,You won't be disapointed with this oldy but goody. Everything you need to get started. This book is great for repairs and the basics. I would suggest some plumbing knowledge however.
4,GOOD ENOUGH,I'm a beginner looking to tackle various home improvement projects and want to do it myself with the help of manuals. I'm looking for manuals with instructions that are descriptive as possible with a lot of illustrations. This one is ok. It's a little lacking in the instructions department but serviceable enough if you're fairly competent.
3,Success Beyond Work: What Prosperous Massage Therapists Know,"Quick read, easily understandable. It was nice to hear from someone trained in the profession who was successful in developing a saleable business, rather than just creating a list of clients with limited resale value. For me, there were a few loose strings about how to make the various moves and what to use as your metrics for taking the next step. But, that's what we have financial advisors for isn't it? Worth the read."
5,"Fun, fun book","This book is a star. Hugely entertaining, smart, sassy and great fun. A pageturner and an eye-opener."
5,BEST OF FRIENDS,ONCE AGAIN I ENJOYED CATHY KELLY. CAN I HAVE A LIST OF ALL HER BOOKS? HOPE SHE WRITES MOREBOOKS
2,I Found This A Very Difficult Read,"This book was much harder to read than I expected. The author is British and expects that his readers are all British. Unless you have an intimate knowledge of England, its television shows, its local celebrities and its slang, it is easy to get lost. As an American, I found myself unable to follow a good deal of the book. I understood enough to get the gist, but feel I missed an awful lot of the information because it may as well have been written in a foreign language."
1,MY EYES.........MY BRAIN..............THEY HURT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Reading this was like running down to the cellar to change a fuse in your bare feet during a thunder and lightening storm, with the floor covered in broken glass and thumbtacks.If you buy this book, buy a dictionary along with it. This author took a simple and easy read subject and turned it into pain-filled bother. The information, I think, is there. You'll need to crawl up sharp rocks on the hottest day of the year with no water, to get to it though."
3,For completists...,Thought it would be more fun. C'mon... it's Ringo! One of the coolest. OK book but I prefer more first hand writing. Covers events but I don't feel I know the man any better and that's what I wanted.
5,doesnt irritate skin,I used this product in conjuction with kinesiotape which really help the tape stay on better. Good for individuals who sweat or when using tape for swimmers...
4,Chanel,I have been looking for this particular book in book stores for awhile. I am enjoying the book but was disappointed to have to pay a premium price.
2,"great idea, but not great product","My daughter was so excited to order this for her birthday. We got it in and it did not work consistently, so no problem, we just contacted the vendor and they were very prompt in sending a replacement. Unfortunately the replacement was worse than the first globe. All of the readings were around 1/2"" off, so when you touched Portugal it told you you were in Italy...not too good! Anyway I would like to note that even though the product was faulty...which I have never encountered previously from Leap Frog, the customer support at Wizard of Math was exceptional."
4,Gay Samurai and the Birth of the Tango,"Ernesto Schoo is one of Argentina's masterly craftsmen of fiction. Although his writing is not as well known as that of his contemporaries, Schoo's playful, campy, ironic, wickedly funny, and poignant work is very much worth reading.The novel takes place in 18th century Japan and involves two homosexual samurai whose passionate love story takes them on a series of adventures and misadventures across the Japanese landscape. The events, comical and tragic, sexy and cruel, are described in vivid detail with a delightfully campy style that makes the reading very pleasurable. Schoo's luscious blending of a Japanese setting with Argentine sensibility is thoroughly satisfying."
2,"Cute little boxes, crap folding instructions.","I wouldn't recommend this book to a beginer, unless said beginer can look at the finished folded product and reverse engineer it. Forget trying to get a precise fold from following the diagrams. Though I was able to master the lid of one of these boxes no thanks to the diagrams, going onto the base ceased to be a pleasurable activity. I'm not heavily into origami, I just wanted to do a few projects for fun. I might as well be re-writing the book myself if I'm going to fold any more of these projects. I wasted my money, but at least I've spared the world of the curse of one more of these books since my copy it now torn apart and rests in the watse receptacle."
5,Existentialism and Nihilism,This moving feature begins with the contradictory nature of all epistemological assertions and proceeds to illustrate the meaninglessness of life and the futility of persistence. This examination of existential and nihilistic themes is manifested in beautiful cinematography and a brilliant musical accompaniment.
4,the turin horse...,"a wonderful movie. well written, spetecular. HIGHLY reccomend picking it up if you wanr, this is a masterpiece. it came package nice and neat. Again I reccomend this movie"
5,Excellent,"I play this cd every single day at least five times, and have shared it with others who want to have one of their own."
3,Stylish pair,Shoes are elegant and great summer wear. They can be worn not only with jeans but for a easy night out on the town. Fit however is a bit small and you may have to go up a half size to get a fit true to size.
2,Not Very Comfortable,"I ordered these because they sounded like they would be comfortable and the previous reviews were very positive. The shoes look cute, but let me warn you----if you have trouble wearing thongs, you may not be able to wear these. The leather is not at all soft, and it felt like a tree branch between my toes!"
5,Every Picture Tells A Story,"There is a shot of Hitler primping in his open car before an adoring crowd, just soaking up the adulation. There is three-mile island ominously sitting in the dark with red lights (like Christmas lights) outlining it, and perhaps previewing the nuclear meltdown that occurred there in the late 70's. There is Dolly, the cloned sheep, looking at herself in the mirror, as amazed as we were at that time. There is a young Fidel Castro screaming into the microphone as he took over Cuba. There is the bus load of passengers reading about the Kennedy assassination at the same time, the disturbing headlines all facing the camera. These are just samplings of the great work that Life did.Life was good at taking the right photographs at the right time.This book is a good one, even if you only look at the pictures."
5,Life Magazine Photo Journalism,"As always, Life photographers do a great job of capturing important moments in our lives. I originally bought this as a gift but liked it so much I had to keep it!"
1,Way too easy - an insult to adults,I am not an authority but my ESL student would not find much to learn from this book. Perhaps I should not have purchased the beginners book.
4,Good tool for non-English speaking teachers,"This book was purchased to be sent to a slum school in the Kibera slum of Nairobi, Kenya as a resource for the school native teachers where it is used to teach English (the primary language of Kenya) to students preparing for their entrance exams to a secondary school."
3,Caution: Past Perfect alert,"""The house had been destroyed by the soldiers."" is NOT past perfect, as indicated by the author on page 49. IN THE ABSENCE OF ANOTHER INDICATOR OF TIMING (what is sometimes called a ""peg""), the quoted sentence only LOOKS like the past perfect because the verb is in the FORM that is usual for, nay always the form of, the past perfect. It would be correct to say that ""by the time it's former occupants were able to return to the village, (ding-dong: timing peg), their home had (already) been destroyed by the soldiers"".The Past Perfect: By the time something happened, something else had already happened."
2,The reason people hate grammar,I returned this book because it annoyed me on the very first page. It starts with a discourse about the difference between proper and common nouns. The approach is very rule-oriented rather than real-world-use oriented.
5,Muy provechoso,"Vine a vivir a Estados Unidos hace dos anos... mi ingles era bastante bueno (para el lugar de donde vengo), pero me gusta siempre mejorar... vivo rodeada de americanos, asi que nadie habla Espanol, por lo tanto me veo empujada a mejorar cada dia mas mi Ingles... Este libro es muy bueno, especialmente porque a mi me gusta confirmar (con la practicas) lo que estoy aprendiendo... a muchos les parece aburrido porque se escribe demasiado, pero para mi en particular es una de las mejores formas de aprender... muy bueno... lo recomiendo para aquellos que como yo, necesitan mejorar su ingles, sobre todo a la hora de escribir, decir o expresar oraciones y frases con sentido en todos los tiempos (presente, pasado o futuro) estoy convencida de que la practica hace al maestro..."
5,Great Story for a Community or Garden Unit,"This is a wonderful story about a little girl who works with her neighbors to turn a vacant lot into a garden. Over the course of the story the grumpy old man changes because of the garden. It's a great story, high readability for middle to end third grade students on grade level."
2,My least favorite book from MC Beaton,"I forced myself to finish this book. I did not care for either main character. My favorite character was Charlie. Delphine was self-righteous and forever angry. The character of Jules had no depth. I didn't feel their ""genuineness"".I love MC Beaton and enjoy reading her books very much. My favorite series is the Poor Relation series. This book did not measure up to the other books I have read by Beaton, and I have read A LOT OF THEM!!!"
5,Inspiring,"The words of this book were incredibly encouraging as a divorced single women. The pressures in dating today, in this world, can be very overwelming. This book was inspiring and motivational to become more Christ like."
2,Skip it...,I kept trying to like this book. Its written a bit awkward. The view point changes from paragraph to paragraph at times. The author doesn't seem to have a grasp of motivation for her characters. The main characters emotions don't seem to fit most situations. Use of language is a bit stifled. The pace is pretty good and probably the only thing that kept me reading. The best part of the book was when she began to tell from the Queen's point of view but then a few pages later the Queen's character is very rigid and you no longer see the insite that you did. Like I said I really tried...
2,No range,The key chain claims to have a range of 150 ft. In truth it does not work consistently at 25 ft
1,the key chain remote control,This remote WILL not work with the newer GE remote control devises !!! it will work with the older ones. I am a little unhappy about this !! I called GE and they said It wasn't their problem ??!!
2,Good basic info but dated,Useful at a basic strategy level but a lot of it is publically available lists and a lot of stats are from 2008.
1,Brutal sex scenes and Nazi torture make it a sad read,"This novel is literally full of brutal sex between older men and young girls communicating a lack of respect for women and a timid glorification of physical harm. ""Creativity"" is only evident in the shifting timeline, which is also confusing, and in the personality of the hero detective. There is no joy. I would avoid this book."
2,Please take away the author's word processor!,"Too long.Too much smoking and drinking.Too much bizarre sex.A disappointment, because it could have been much better."
4,Solid characters make good mystery / suspense,"Small Death in Lisbon was a great story--actually two stories intertwined. One of them takes place in modern-day Lisbon and follows the investigation of a murdered teenager. The other story starts in Germany during WWII. The stories finally converge around page 400, but by this time I had already become bored with the WWII story, and found myself skimming the chapters, wanting to get back to the modern story. But, by the time the stories did converge, I loved the outcome. I thought it was a great mystery/suspense novel.I am looking forward to other books by Wilson. I really liked the characters in the book. Coehlo's first person narrative was so strong, you could really feel his struggles and frustations."
2,Fantastic book....,until the conclusion. I really thought this was one of the finest books I've ever read until I reached the conclusion. The ending was so complicated and bizarre I couldn't understand it. This was definitely one of the strangest books I've read in that regard.The beginning of the book was so good that I had to give it a fair grade.
2,"Starts strong, but gets disgusting","""A Small Death in Lisbon"" reads incredibly well in the middle.At that point, both stories, a modern day murder mystery, anda WWII Nazi smuggling story, switch back and forth withstriking momentum. So what happens? The reader becomes assaulted with a series of stomach-turning encounters: multiple rapes, demented murder, sodomy, incest. When a major plot point seems to hinge on sodomy, I started to think this book wasn't for me. However, there are plenty of good twists and turns in the last part of the book, and this book feels authentic in its history, but I felt like these elements became overshadowed by the graphic content."
3,Not bad,"This was the first book I have read by Robert Wilson. Amazon recommended it to me as a frequent purchaser of books by Alan Furst. Wilson is not quite as good or evocative as Furst. The novel shifts back and forth between what appears to be a conventional murder investigation in the late 1990s in Portugal and the story of an SS officer who is sent to Portugal during World War II to procure wolfram (tungsten) for the Nazi war effort. There is little to like about any of the characters in this book, including the murder victim. Also, the book takes forever to establish the connection between the World War II story line and the more current one. That said, the book contains some surprising twists and turns. It keeps the reader's interest right up until the conclusion."
3,Somehow unsatisfying,"This book is very well written and well paced; I never became bored. The plot is cleverly constructed, perhaps a little too cleverly in the end, as some of the final twists struck me as just a little too neat in a book that seemed to strive for gritty realism. For me, the main thing that prevents me from giving it a higher rating is its emotional coldness. Wilson never made me care for or about any of the characters. For a sometimes bloody story, it is ultimately a bloodless book."
4,A clandestine Casino,"When reading this book, I could not get the comparisons to Casino out of my head. I am not saying they shared plot lines, or characters, or anything else for that matter; I just kept feeling like I was reading a remake of the film, only set in WW2 Germany and present day Lisbon.The book has a sweeping epic type of timeline. The main characters eventually give way to their adult children, who then become the focus of the book, save for the Detective trying to solve the initial murder in the present.A Small Death in Lisbon serves up a couple of great plot twists, along with one not-so-great revelation. It was fun to read, and kept me guessing for the most part.I suggest you read it, and see if you get my Casino reference. I am probably just nuts though.Read it."
4,Great Read. Stick With It.,"I really liked this book. Great characters and great descriptions of Lisboa, which is really an oft over-looked city. Sometimes, I admit, I had to keep at reading since he does, sometimes, get carried away but it was definitely worth keeping at it despite those small lapses leading to some excessive length. Personally I read quickly and like a longer novel versus something I can read in one airplane trip. A gripping tale and very interesting for the machinations and psychology involved in the complicated scenario. A really good writer and his other books are equally worthwhile."
3,Medium --,"I think this is thriller is basically a failure. Although it is often interesting and Wilson has crafted a highly sympathetic protagonist in the form of the Lisbon inspector investigating a murder, the plot does not hang together. There are a few unlikely coincidences and, ultimately, the solution does not meet the smell test in that it is too complex and seems tacked together to tie this complicated novel's many plot threads together at the end. Wilson's weaving in of sex is downright gratuitous (to the point where female readers may be thoroughly turned off) and his style is awash with oddly uniodiomatic English which we could possibly attribute to his long stays outside of Britain. In sum: an overhyped medium-level thriller."
2,"OK murder mystery, good premise","I was disappointed after reading through so much difficult story to get to the end. The killer came out of no where... not believable at all. It was all too tidy and trite. And the relationship between Carlos & Olivia was ridiculous. Give me a break. Only a male author would write such nonsense. Oh yeah, and the father's just going to be fine with it, yeah OK. I just felt it was a farfetched story to begin with.It was a dark and dreary, seedy and grizzly novel, and I did not care much for it. It was also very confusing at times. I didn't have as much trouble with Umberto Eco as I had with this novel."
3,A first rate writer in need of an editor,"By reading the reviews you get an idea of the story;the above title gives you an idea of the problem. A good ,sharp thriller could have been shaped here and instead we get an over written stew ,with about too much of everything in it.The 3 stars are for the writer alone and his unquestionable talent.Until he gets carried away,he makes you see and hear and smell the colors of the time and city.Recomended for that alone and I suppose it is worth the sometime tedious trip and price of admission."
2,Utterly Confusing,"Granted I'm not really a mystery person and my apology to those who really liked this book but I thought it was choppy, confusing, and not worth finishing. The introduction of new characters was not smooth at all, the segue between Germany and Lisbon had too many gaps. The unfinished tome will sit in my Kindle."
2,Missed Opportunity,"Are you thinking about visiting Portugal? Well, if you are, don't read this book! The country is pictured in an appalling light--virtually all of the men are coarse, brutal rapists, the women are all ..., and it almost seems as if the land itself is to blame. None of the characters are really sympathetic, and much of the descriptive prose could have been eliminated. Having said all of this, the book is well-written, and the premise is very good. It's just too long and too dark. There were times when I actually felt dirty after closing the book. What disturbed me most was that the most amoral, despicable character in the book (the lawyer ""father"" of the murdered girl) does not get his comeuppance. In a mystery, I want the villain to get justice in the end, and it just doesn't happen here."
2,"Tedious, Wordy, Confusing","I just finished reading this book and I must say, I'm exhausted. Like other reviewers, I was getting a little annoyed by all the drinking, drug abuse and graphic sex throughout the novel. Also, the author tends to put Portuguese people in a very negative light by suggesting that many girls tend to engage in sex with grown men while the parents and government ignore it.I don't understand why he had to continue to switch from the past to the present the way he did. He could have presented the story in some kind of chronological order and it still would have worked. The book was too long, had too many irrelevant details and as I stated earlier, it was very tiring."
1,In a Word - tedious,"Bought this book because of the hype - sometimes I do that - as usual, it was a mistake. This was one of the most boring books I read in 2006."
2,Do yourself a favor and read something else.,"Although this book has many favorable reviews and is fairly readable, it is not for everyone. The plot instrument of following two converging stories separated by decades is interesting to a point, but finally exhausting and frustrating as often the stories switch just when you become interested in the current vignette. While at times it was captivating and kept me up late, the ending was predictable with a ""gotcha"" twist and I had to force myself to finish the book. All of the characters are flawed and some are quite disturbed. The women characters in particular are unbelievable or deviants. I buy many books. The best I keep and the rest I donate to the library. This one I added to the recycling."
4,Missed It By That Much,"This was almost a great book, but has to settle for very good. The character studies were absolutely superb, and for most of the book, the plotting was excellent as well. However, the ending was just a bit too far-fetched to be believable, which took the book down one star. All in all, however, a great read, and a fast one too."
2,A 450 page shaggy dog story (though well written),"I realize this book received many international awards, and most of the customer reviews were positive. Having said that, this book was way too much weight for a strained, incredulous plot. A book covering a 60 year period always suggests something of historical importance to me. Unfortunately this was not the case here. The time frame scaffolding and the historical events depicted just doesn't help the slender plot. You know the two stories are coming together sometime, but the way they do seems so offhand and, really, unrelated to whatever theme the author is trying to work out. The denouement comes out of left field and is very unsatisfying. Too much work to get through this slow, heavy, so called thriller."
2,An Artificial Grand Drama Without Weight and/or Depth,"Two seemingly unconnected stories are described alternately. In 1941 during WW2, Klaus Felsen, a German industrialist, is forced by Nazis to take a command of the tungsten procurement operation in Portugal. In 199*, Ze Coehlo, a police inspector, investigates a murder case of a 15-year-old girl in Lisbon.The idea is very interesting, but I am quite disappointed. This novel is too artificial and it lacks weight and/or depth as a grand drama of a half century. Coehlo's story is tedious and Felsen's story is hasty. Especially, I lose interest when Felsen, a likable man in the beginning, turns into a savage brute too rapidly. It might be a little better if his change were described more slowly and carefully. And the conclusion may be elaborate, but it is too artificial."
2,In search of an editor !!!,"Most good mysteries end after 350 pages. This book screams out for an editor to grab Wilson and yell "" enough already !!!""The book languishes on for another 100 tedious pages as the detective races around Lisbon tying the ends of the crime together. The book has its virtues. Lisbon and Portugal are beautifully described, the meals are appealing and the history behind the plot we can accept as part of the fictional underpinnings but it is too long. If the author did not feel it necessary to give every man, woman and child a few lines of hot ... the book would have really achieved all that the reviewers have written about it"
4,Strongly recommend this well-written crime novel,"Hungry for something which one can call literature at $... or so? I don't discover it often but A Small Death in Lisbon is a find. Very well-written, which is rare these days. Intricate plot. Unusual setting in Lisbon. Hard to put down. The two plots are both so interesting that I had an internal debate as to which one I hoped would be on the next page.I do recommend strongly. However, this book may not be for everyone. Sex, gore and the two combined. But I'm pretty skittish and I was not put off."
4,"Turina's ""Mujeres""--very well done, but Sara Davis Buechner's is preferable","Although I've been enjoying Jordi Masó's ongoing series of Turina's piano music for NAXOS (to date, the only complete one to materialize), I feel that in the case of this recording of the composer's three suites devoted to the women of Spain, he yields the palm to the recording on KOCH by Sara Davis Buechner.In short, although Masó does a very nice job, Ms. Buechner's portrayal of these beguiling ladies is more vivid in every way. Rather than repeat here most of what I said in my review of her recording, I refer the reader to that review, where I discuss both recordings more fully: (Joaquin Turina: Mujeres Españolas (Women of Spain)). Happy hunting--I don't think you'll be disappointed."
5,Copies in Seconds by David Owen,"Years ago I worked for the company (Battelle Memorial Institute)that sponsored Carl Chesterson's research on the xerography process which ultimately led to the development of the Xerox copying machine. Interested in the what the author had to say about the inventor and the details of the development process, I checked the book out of our local library and enjoyed it immensely. And because we have grandchildren who show promise of becoming inventors, we ordered 2 of the books from Amazon.com and are planning to hand them out as Christmas gifts. I'd recommend the book to any ""have been inventors"" and ""would be inventors"" to experience the failures and successes Chesterson encountered during his lifetime quest to develop the xerography process."
3,"Great story, but the book could have been better","The story of how the first plain-paper copier was invented is exciting and inspirational to engineers and designers. This book was an excellent compilation of the history of paper, historical duplicating techniques, and modern technology. However, I found myself wanting more detail on the technical details of the discoveries and history of the copier as I read this book.I give the story (5 out of 5) stars, but my impression of the writing style of the author was only average (3 out of 5 stars). This book was enjoyable, but at times I wanted to be finished with it so I could move on to another book."
1,A weak facsimile of a life,"I was genuinely interested in the history of the Xerox machine. The process of invention and design is fascinating to me. The story that Owen tells is an interesting story written in an uninteresting way. What is more surprising, given the author's credentials, is that the writing level is that of a 7th-grader! I labored through the book since I was interested in the history. But this is a tedious read indeed."
2,Not much beyond the basics,"If you've read about the basics of the semantic web online, you won't get much more from this book. There's only 6 pages devoted to SPARQL, and no mention of RDFa. Later chapters (especially ""Ontology Engineering"") are thin and weak. You learn the dirt basics, but not how to build anything meaningful with it."
4,good enough to keep you clapping.....,"ok, the rock scene in Argentina has always been kind of avant garde in South america, and this relatively new band show it why, ok, this is no new stuff, everybody related with the buzzcocks or supergrass material, will have a good time with this funny band and its high spirited music....enjoy. ""Loco un poco"" might be one of the catchiest singles ever....."
2,Graduate Student Review,"My motivation for purchasing this text was for a graduate level course on Software Defined Review in Electrical Engineering. The text was somewhat useful with relatively clear illustrations, formulas, and text. The text was somewhat useful with clear illustrations and formulas but lacked the clarity desired to grasp a full understanding of the material from simply reading the book. As such, the text was primarily used as a reference source when lecture material failed to provided enough depth or coverage of a particular subject area. In summary, I would recommend purchasing this book if required but I would look for another text if you are simply trying to get a better understanding of the subject."
1,Warning- I bought two of these- both were defective-,"GE usually makes good products, but the GE 51138- remote /lamp wall switch kit did not work for me. I tried plugging different items into the device- nothing worked with the remote control. Amazon sent me out a second one as a replacement- that still didn't work. The light on the remote did light up, so I know it was working at least partially. Beware- if you buy this there is a good chance you will return it."
3,Warning! Instructions not included...,"I just wanted to warn everyone that this item does not come with written instructions to duplicate the four creations. You must download from the lego website. These instructions are difficult to see on the computer and when printed it is especially difficult to see necessary fine details. As any lego lover knows, it's all in the details! What started out to be an ""awesome"" Christmas gift for an 11 year old boy has turned into a source of frustration. Buyer beware!"
3,Haunting of Amelia,Sort of a slow moving movie. Had to watch it 2 times to get the plot correct. Made you think but not too deeply.
2,Boring but we live where it was filmed.,"I'm only giving this 2 stars because I live in Wallingford and it was filmed here at our favorite pizza place, Trackside Pizza!"
2,Disappointing,"Mild fragrance but VERY disappointing that it takes so much product to get the ""foam"" to wash during a shower. I won't buy more."
3,DJ Scotty and DJ Scotty,"Hey all you American ravers and Richard Marx fans, get this DJ Scotty, the famous German ""DJ"", recorded this okay but not great single as a side project. Now for those of you who bought the CD or promo vinyl or are thinking of buying the CD your probably wondering who is Full Gainer? Get this, Full Gainer is none other than DJ Scotty himself singing through a vocoder to make himself sound like a woman, that's why the vocals in this okay remake of Richard Marx are so bad and squeaky sounding. But my review for this CD is it's an okay CD, don't blow your money away with this CD unless your money doesn't have any other use. For all you DJ Scotty fans, this is a major dissapoinment."
5,Off the hook!,"Lil' Mo really delivers it with Meet the Girl Next Door. With Missy Elliot producing the trax and Lil' Mo's great vocals this album is one to remember. The best trax are definetley ""4ever"" ""Shoulda Known"" & ""Aint No Reason"". Lil Mo squashes Ashanti's Chapter II, and gives Beyonces Dangerously In Love a run for its money. This album is definetley an essential cd to add to your collection."
3,Not as good as I expected,"Dont get me wrong this is not a bad album its just not near as good as her previous effort Based on A True Story which I would give five stars. The best songs on this album are 4ever of course and the last song ""Letter to my #1 fan "" is decent but I think the song runs a little 2 long. There are only few bright spots on this album but none of the production is up to par with the production on 4 ever. Also the song with lil kim is okay. If you are real big Lil Mo fan you should buy this album, but if not your not missing a whole lot."
5,LiL mO bRoKe !t DoWn!,"Lil Mo's album was defitnetly bangin.At first I wasnt sure wheather or not to cop tha album cuz i personally didnt find the first 1 interestin'.But I decided to cop it-and boy am I sho glad I did!!With Lil Mo's OUTSTANDIN gospel skills and Missy elliot's great producing, this album should be the album of the year, fa sho.She knocks Ashanti's Chapter II off the shelf,but leaves some room for B3yonce.If I could sum up tha vibe of the cd i would say she's very much happy and very much satisfied.My favs are''Why do we fall in love""""Doing me wrong""""Heaven""""Brand Nu""""1st time"" (my fav)""1st time""""So lost without you""""Shoulda Known""""Its your world""""Letter to my #1 fan""OoO yea and ""4ever"" which everybody knoes bouUt.If you dont got this, go git ti right now!!"
5,Totally awesome,"I didn't know much about Lil Mo, until I just happen to borrow this cd (Meet The Girl Next Door) from a friend because I had already listened to all my friend's other cds. I must say and say again, I was blown away with every song on the cd. There are not many cds that you can actually just love every every song, but this is the one. I have a new found respect for the artist we call lil Mo. She's a very bad girl.......YOU GO GIRL!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Good overall intro to low temp ""smoke"" grilling","This is a nice fattish book that provides plenty of recipes. The book doesn't pretend to be ""gourmet"" but rather provides exactly what the cover suggests: Good ol' American BBQ.Recommended as a first book for anyone that wants to try their hand at smoking/slow [charcoal] cooking/grilling. The instructions and text are good and clear throughout. I hesitated to give the book 5 stars but decided that I reserve the 5 star ratings for truly exceptional books. In this case for instance, one thing I would have liked to see are more pictures/photos...."
3,It's okay,Book did not have as much depth of info as I would have liked. Still okay to start smoking with.
2,Smoke And Spice meets the Yuppie Chef,"Perhaps I was wanting much more from a mere bbq book...Being from Texas I am almost ashamed to even believe that these guys consider themselves authorities on Texas cooking!! I am a big fan of rustic type cooking.....downhome cooking if you will.....Out of the hundreds of recipes listed, I may only use three or four......if that......I was also wanting pictures from the prepared recipes, but no dice!! There was good, limited information on choosing the types of wood and bbq pits....Overall, I would rate this book just average......A much better book that has numerous illustrations is ""How TO GRIll"" by Steven Raichlen.......I would recommend this book to anyone interested in bbq smoking or grilling......as for Smoke & Spice, lets leave it for the designing women......."
2,Liquid Smoke,"Doesn't mention how naturally smoking meats can be harmful. Use liquid smoke, it's safe."
1,no substance,Don't waste your time or money on this book. Too general and not very useful. Go with an In-Fisherman book. Anything else will be better than this.
2,If it was easier to put on and take off and put back on...,"Well, my dog has actually only worn this for about two minutes- my husband felt bad for him when he saw how funny he walked with it on. It probably would have worked too, but after he took it off, we haven't put it back on because it's just a pain to do- lots of straps and stuff everywhere- it gets confusing. They should have had the buckles marked- that might have made it easier and more user-friendly and it might actually have been used then."
2,"works, I guess?","This product is so difficult to figure out. If you were trying to assemble and put it on a dog mannequin it would be hard, and we are all actually trying to put this on our wildly thrashing, over-excited dogs. It just doesn't work! I assembled it properly a few times, the other times, just sort of improvised, i.e. putting limbs through loops, pulling cords tight and tying them together until my dog was clearly hindered from moving freely. There has to be a better way to do this. maybe color-coded pieces? Or a little more structure and less one-size-fits-all? At any rate, the first time I turned my back, she gnawed through the nylon straps in like, .5 seconds. I sewed them back with my sewing machine, tried it a couple more times, then my husband stepped in and installed a trolley/cable. The idea of my dog being tethered whenever she is out appalls me, but the harness just wasn't practical."
2,No jump,This might be better for a smaller dog. I used it on my boxer who is 62 lbs and it only worked well if it was too tight on her.
3,No-jump harness,"It will cause the dog to have sores on the back of his legs, after a while one needs to check to make sure it is secure because the dog will work it loose and start jumping."
2,Dog Trap,"I really should have listened to the other reviews, but I thought, ""Hey, my dog's aren't like those dogs."" Really though, my dogs are pretty easy when it comes to me working with them. But even I went cross eyed a few times trying to get the harness on the dogs. Once I got the harness on the larger dog, my wife and I just started cracking up. I mean, we might as well have duct taped the dogs paws together. However, it did work as advertised, No Jumping! But, not much walking either. If I wanted my dog to just stand there afraid to move, I would have been better off putting her in a crate...lol. Shortly after, we were pretty quick to look up how to return the item. Sorry, it's just really not a great product."
1,Very difficult to use,"I have a new dog that can jump fences and I thought this would be a useful product. Trying to figure out how to put it on my dog was very difficult and I thought of making a more simple one out of rope. I understand the design, but there are too many straps, buckles, and strap connectors along with poor instructions. Very disappointing."
1,Don't even bother,"We were so desperate to keep the dog from jumping over our 6 foot fence that we ignored the reviews and purchased it anyway. We wish we hadn't. This thing is impossible to put on, truly. If you do get it on, the dog will promptly chew it off. Huge waste of money!"
1,terrible,this will not work for a short stubby dog. We have a bulldog and it just slips off her legs and will not stay tight.
2,Confusing,"Wanted it for my Springer spaniel who jumps the fence, but I was never sure if I had it on right or if it was too tight, or too loose."
1,No Jump Harness,Not very happy. It broke the second time I used it. I was difficult to get it adjusted correctly. Would not recommed this product.
4,Plastic Ice Cube Trays,I was searching for a plastic tray that made small ice cubes as I am a compulsive ice eater and large cubes are hard on the jaw and teeth. I found just what I was looking for and am very happy with them.
2,Cubes don't release easily,"I wanted to find some trays that made smaller sized cubes...and these are small, but the trays just don't release easily. I am much happier with some other ice trays that make small cubes, which I also purchased here on Amazon...Camco 44100 RV Mini Ice Cube Tray - Pack of 2. In fact, I'm coming back to purchase a couple more of the RV trays...they work great with easy twist and release and they're made in USA too!"
3,You get what you pay for.,These ice trays are pretty neat but not entirely effective. If you do buy these buy two of them. Half a container of ice is for one glass or there about. Removing the ice pellets is pretty simple. Just wiggle the tray back and forth. I decided to make several batches of ice and keep a container in the freezer for ease of use. Overall good trays but buy two.
4,Small cube ice trays,"After looking high and low, I finally found these small cube ice trays. They were just the size I was looking for, and appear to be quite sturdy (a good thing since I use a LOT of ice!) The only problem is that a few ice cubes are sometimes left in the tray when I empty it, but that happens with most plastic ice trays. Overall, I am well pleased with them and would purchase them again if I needed more."
5,Love this ICE tray,Bought this so I could have ice coffee at work and actually not have huge ice cubes. I wanted the ice to be the size as if I were at a coffee shop. Love this product
5,Great!,This is great! I love to use these for any thing ice related. It's great in blenders or bottles. Even just a glass of ice water.
3,A tiny ice cube tray,"It makes small, gumdrop shaped ice cubes. It is very durable, but I would expect that something like this would cost less. A good option if you're looking for something durable."
2,it didn't last long,I had these ice tray for about a month before they snapped in half when trying to get the ice out. and getting the ice out is a lot of work.
5,Best Ice Trays Ever.,"I scoured stores far and wide and was unable to find these ice trays. I had an ice tray like this, but as it is quite old, I could not remember where I had purchased it. Just one tray could not quench my ice addiction, so luckily my search ended here! By far the best ice trays ever, especially if you enjoy chewing ice or making smoothies (easy on the teeth and blender)! Do not buy these ice trays and expect for optimum cooling of a completely warm drink, unless you plan on using the whole tray (Highly Recommended)."
2,sad,"I eat ice all day long, and this little ice cubes are so wonderful! The problem is you can barely twist the tray to get the cubes out, and even then they crack and eventually break in half, within a few weeks."
2,Nice size but too brittle,"My husband eats ice all day every day and the tiny pieces are perfect for this. However, we have gone through literally 20 trays in the last year because they break so easily. It is nearly impossible to get the pieces out without twisting the tray. And if you twist the tray it breaks. There must be a better way to get tiny ice cubes."
2,Great idea but impossible to remove,"Maybe a third would release after being frozen. Some twisting and shaking and another ten would drop. Some beating and swearing and maybe another ten would release. Just not worth the effort. I just love the idea, though, irresistible. Wish it had worked."
5,Pleased with purchase,"Nice little bullet/thimble (take your pick) shaped ice cubes. Great for cocktails.And they pop easily out of the tray! Also, p.s. for dog owners; they make greatlittle treats for dogs if you're watching their weight..."
4,Ice Tray,If you have a Magic Bullet Blender the smaller ice cubes help you make a more even texture for your smoothie. This Ice Tray is good but they need to come up with a good release system for the ice cubes like I have seen on bigger trays.
3,Wish they were smaller,I have developed an ice crunching addiction and they are still to large to chew. They don't pop out as well as I would wish.
4,Great,"I eat ice constantly & can run any automatic icemaker dry, winter or summer. I have 3 of these trays & they keep my icemaker from bottoming out. The cubes are a perfect size for crunching. I empty the trays inside a plastic bag & that also serves as storage. I either leave them on the counter for a few minutes before emptying, or sometimes I run some hot water over the bag with the tray in it & loosen them that way. I haven't had any problems with the trays cracking at all.Update: Well, ultimately they do crack. I've tried to be careful, but there are times when I guess I had an ice-crunching emergency did not wait long enough or twisted too hard, I don't know. But I'm taking my rating down to 4 stars. Not that I don't really like them, but I think they should last longer than a year."
1,Don't buy these!!,I received these ice trays (4) at the beginning of April 2010 and by the end of June 2010 they were all cracked. Now they are totally useless and have all cracked in half! A total waste of money!
1,Ice round tray,Ice cube means six rectangular sides which is a shape of a cube. These things are connical shape so when you bend the tray to get the ice out they jump out like mexican jumping beans.There is no way to get the ice out unless you use twizzers for each one. This is the by far the worse thing I ever bought.Arrow Plastic 00055 Ice Cube Tray
2,Way too small,"The size of the ice cubes are way too small, for me to even like the product. Before you can even pour this in your drink, It'll probably melt, because it's tiny. The construction is really good. I feel this one will last awhile. That's the only thing I like about this ice tray."
5,Ice cubes,"This is a perfect size for small ice cubes! I have no problems with getting the ice cubes out, which some others have said they have had an issue with it."
1,Broke with first cubes,This tray was so flimsy it broke on my first use. The cubes wouldn't come out of the tray and the plastic broke when I tried to get the cubes out. I would not recommend this product.
3,Quite skimpy,"This is not a bad introductory documentation book, but quite skimpy in the amount of information and examples it contains.Not sure it is worth buying at that price. I bought it after reading the previous reviews - I think they overrated it!"
4,Does what it's supposed to do,"This product does exactly what it's designed and advertised to do. Would be great for busking, or just getting a quickie monitor setup."
2,Small but not mighty,"This works well in a small room. As soon as you try to crank up the sound, the sound becomes somewhat distorted and you can hear humming in the unit. Useful for practice but not for performance purposes. I returned it for a larger monitor."
1,Before you buy this book!!!!!,This book is only appropriate for the older Excel additions. If you own Excel 2007 this book will do nothing for you!
3,"Fair, worth keeping.","This book is a bizarre mix of basics (how to create a list, change the color of a chart) and seriously advanced (heavy customization, detailed descriptions of every statistical and analytical function), without much in the middle.I wouldn't consider this a dummies book at all, but it's a nice addition to my library for the function descriptions. If you don't have a clue what you are doing, start elsewhere."
2,Useable,"This book has useful information but the layout, paper quality, and wording make it very hard to read. It's sad, but I feel that if the publisher had put a little more work into the presentation and material quality that this book would be 1000 times more successful."
5,Larmore Fan,"The version of Saint-Sans' ""Mon coeur s'ouvre à ta voix"" that she sings on this CD has a very nice part for solo cello that I've never heard in any other version. This is my favorite aria on the disc so I would have gotten it just for that."
5,Uplifting and Inspring,"This is a wonderful CD filled with chants in English. They are beautiful, simple and profound and a good way to begin my morning's drive into work. I would recommend this CD to anyone looking for wonderful chants to listen and/or sing with."
1,"If the world were only the USA, this would be a good atlas!","After I purchased this atlas, I realized that this is one of those times when one should actually pick up a copy of a book first in a library or bookstore before ordering it. While the maps themselves are fine, there simply are not enough of them. The atlas focuses on the USA with approximately 30 pages of maps, but the apparently insignificant mass of permafrost and ice to the north of it gets one page! The rest of the world isn't treated much better. There are several very good world atlases that actually deal with entire world. Unfortunately, this isn't one of them."
4,I can't believe this blunder!,"Beware of the photo of Mt. Everest that introduces the section on Asia; it is printed left/right backward! Only error I caught while glancing through it quickly, but definitely glaring, plus I'm rather attuned to mountain photography."
5,Fantastic reference resource,"You will be amazed by the amount of information contained within this book. In fact it probably contains more useful information (about all the countries of the world) than say 50 other books put together. National Geographic photographs and maps are usually world class, as is this reference book. Highly recommended."
2,not impressive,"Not what I expected. Didn't stay tight to the phone, stretched easily. Took it off after 1 day."
2,Not As Good As Gold Cup,It is oil and will probably work for most Spyders and Tippmanns but I would still recommend getting Gold Cup oil for only a couple dollars more. The Gold Cup is much better at lubricating than this oil.
2,Ripoff,"This double CD contains some original artists but they are mixed in with some horrible un-original bands doing horrible un-original songs. I bought this to get Ian McClagans ""Little Troublemaker"" I got the trouble but no McClagan, instead I got Micheal Monroe who did a respectable song but its one of few. You get not Sweet but The Sweet,someone pretending to be Gary Glitter, Mott the Hoople, but its live, Iggy is an exception and sounds great, hear before you buy!"
5,Blonde Antique Leaf Pull,I am completely satisfied with the cabinet hardware recently purchased through Amazon. It is exactly what we expected and was promptly delivered.
5,unreal talent,"She has a very unique sound. It is a beautiful mix of African music,soul, and jazz. She has such a beatiful voice. You should try her."
3,not as complete as one may wish,"the book is huge and has much useful information in it. However, I was somewhat disappointed in regard to the completeness claim the title (and the size) suggests. Especially the more advanced features (the book marks most of them them as ""obscure"") are not covered well at all. In particular, the new features for handling inheritance with UDTs are hardly ever mentioned, let alone illustrated with examples.It seems that in places where they lack experience of their own, the authors copy the reference manuals at best, sometimes not even that."
5,A Must Read For SQL-Beginners + Users + Programmers,"It's really good to read, complete (as the name says) and very practically oriented. It is in fact the only book that I would recommend to people who don't know SQL. Alas alas there is no German-language book on the theme at an acceptable level."
4,Basic Text,"This is easily the best narrative history of the onset of WWII. The emphasis is on a detailed, systematic analysis of the diplomacy and politics of many European nations, including both the major combatants and minor players such as Finland and Turkey. The product of a prodigious amount of research and careful synthesis of the documentary evidence, How War Came is a basic book for understanding WWII. This is very much a detailed, blow by blow (or perhaps telegram by telegram) account of the outbreak of hostilities. This is not a synthesis or analysis of the underlying events that led to war, but it does explain why war broke out at the time it did and how certain combatant nations came to be committed (France and Britain) and others did not (the Soviet Union). Watt in particular writes with real sympathy of the difficult choices faced by the leaders of the western democracies."
4,Excellent historical study.,"""How War Came"" covers the period roughly from Europe to the beginning of World War II. Of course, the key actor in this period was Hitler; it was his will, more than any other factor, that caused the war to start.Of course, no one at the time knew that at the time, and this book accounts the diplomatic efforts made by the Britain, France and others to avoid the War. This provides a useful perspective on the history of the time, which tends to focus exclusively on Hitler. Watt has thoroughly researched this period, and provides information that even those who are well-read in the events leading up to the war will learn much from this book."
2,A Mormon Fishes Alaska,"This book has lots of good information in the charts and maps, but the author is a Mormon and the text is full of the mindless little stories that Mormons enjoy so much. Just skip the text and follow the maps and you'll be okay."
3,You have the wrong review at your web site for this book .,"I do not think ""Fishing Alaska"" is the same as the review you have listed which is ""A Morman fishes Alaska."""
1,Not a good read!,"As a martial artist with over 10 years in a Moo Duk Kwan discipline, I found this book very disappointing! While you have to acknowledge the time and effort that go into writing any book, this work was not well presented. Information was repeated constantly and there wasn't nearly enough of the ""meat"" that I was looking for. While the author trys to convey that the roots of Moo Duk Kwan may go back much farther than just a Japanese art that came from Okinawa, he does not give any detailed evidence or explainations to support this beyond the fact that there were some old cave sketches and that Hwang Kee found an old book in a railroad library. What was in the book that Hwang Kee used to make Moo Duk Kwan ""special""? You got me? As a reader of many many martial arts books, I rate this one on the low end!"
3,feel cheated,"I love the movie, which is why I bought it, not knowing I couldn't play it on my DVD player. I didn't see or understand afterward the region2, deal. So I have a DVD of a movie I loved, and can't watch it. They will not accept it back as I had opened the package."
1,Possibly one of the worst films of all time,"Geppetto, in no doubt, has to be one of the worst films of all time. For example, Seth Adkins, CANNOT act. ""I'm not a puppet, I'm Pinocchio!"" How annoying was that? And his makeup sucked so bad, that instantly you could tell that his face was obviously painted with lines. Drew Carey(Geppetto) sings the most retarded songs ever sang, and his singing voice is like listening to a thousand sharp nails scraping down a blackboard. Although, the song ""Since I gave my heart away,"" was the only good thing about the movie, and that song only appeared at the end of the movie. People are right: there is a light at the end of the tunnel. However, I would recommend this movie to children from the age of three to five, unless of course, if their blind. Hope this review was helpful for you."
4,interesting musical spin on the classic fairytale,"GEPPETTO is an interesting musical spin on the well-known tale of PINOCCHIO. Stephen Schwartz delivers a handsome-if average score, with fine performances from Drew Carey and Julia Louis-Dreyfus in the lead roles.GEPPETTO wisely doesn't try to emulate Disney's landmark 1940 animation version of PINOCCHIO, but instead retells the tale's events from the perspective of Pinocchio's loving creator and father Geppetto. Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays the sparkling and eccentric Blue Fairy, with Seth Adkins as Pinocchio. Among the supporting cast are Broadway talents Brent Spiner and Ana Gasteyer. Popular singing star Usher also appears in the ""Pleasure Island"" scene. Stephen Schwartz provides the score which features the catchy ""Just Because It's Magic"".Drew Carey (who also served as the Executive Producer) has a warm and winning singing voice, and is just about perfect in the title role. A great original musical from Disney."
3,OK FOR FAMILY,"While this is a nice diversion for the children, and features the usual superb Disney productions values (Gepetto's village is a dream version of some Italian side street from a beautiful theme park), it is not among Disney's best. Drew Carey exudes much enthusiasm but is simply not up to the vocal challenge, and Julia Louis Dreyfuss is an odd choice to play the Blue Fairy. The makeup on the small wooden boy is frightening and strange; I think the makeup artists missed the boat on what they might have been going for. The contemporary spin on the Pinocchio story often feels strained to remain PC; Stephen Schwartz is not at the top of his game with songs that, while engaging within the film, do not remain in your heart or memory. Still, given the usual dreck produced for children and their parents, this video is engaging, sweetly conveyed and full of eye-popping fun for the youngsters."
3,"It's OK, but not worth buying","I guess you can save your money and rent it. It is a theatrical loose re-make of animated Pinocchio, sanitized for political correctness. There are very few dances or songs worth mentioning. The scenes of the town with perfect made-to-order children and Pleasure Island are unbearably long. I am not sure what ages this film is targeting: it is hard to develop any affection for the characters, any teachings dilute in the multiple dances and characters."
4,"Easy Install, works well",This thing has worked well for over a year. It was easy to install and tune to the right frequency.
3,Working well....finally,"Product arrived with a dead battery inserted in the battery compartment with no kind of plastic tab to inactivate battery....took 20 minute of messing with codes before I checked the ""brand new"" battery....after driving back and forth to the store for purchasing a new battery and inserting same, it still didnt work....as a last ditch effort I manipulated, back and forth, each miniscule switch to see if there was lost contact, and there was......so much for quality control which was blown away by TWO items that should have been detected by the pro's .....Now that it is functioning, it is doing a good job, better than I anticipated, although it was at another cost for a 12 volt battery, my time, and a gallon of gas.................."
5,Best Chocolate Chips Ever,"You will enjoy every cookie you bake and so will your friends and family. If you live for baking praise, then you cannot go wrong with the purchase of this book."
4,Now it's Quiet,"Good muffler, pretty easy to install, runs nice and quiet now. We used a 2ID 2 1/8"" OD adapter and 2 1/8"" and 2 1/4"" U-Bolts."
3,Difficult assembly,Assembly is difficult. Each metal ray has to be inserted in V shape hole on the body. Requires benting four tabs for each ray. Metal pieces have sharp edges.
5,old but PHAT!,"i know you are looking at the date of when this cd came out, but have faith! this cd is well worth it! ifyou like ICEY and SCOTT HENRY, you will totally dig this cd, i love it, listen to it almost everyday to be honest!happy hunting, becca"
1,Nothing new to learn here,"I was/am really disapointed with this book. Their 'lessons' and advice are no different than any other ""how to train your puppy/dog"" book. If this book thinks it helps deal with ""An Outta Control Puppy"" the author should pay me a visit."
3,Awesome illustrations,"We added this to our Halloween storybook collection this year, and I was a bit disappointed. The illustrations are captivating, but there is nothing special about the text. All ages in our family find this one rather boring."
5,works great,same product as in store but much cheaper. easy to read instructions and easy to make connections to tv and component
5,Great Read,"I'm only on chapter 4 even though I've had the book for several weeks now, because I'm a single, working dad and time is very limited. But so far I feel like I'm learning about EJB much better than resources on the Internet. The book was in excellent condition (I bought used from windowshopbooks).I always recommend ""For Dummies"" books for anyone with no experience in something. And, as usual, I'm pleased with this ""For Dummies"" book."
1,Not for dummies,An absolute waste of time. Its all very nice repeating what the EJB specification states but this is supposed to be for dummies.Do not go near this book if you have not touched EJB's. Wait for or look for something like Visual EJB or similar.
1,Not so good,"Shipping was very quick but unfortunately they shipped the wrong CD.The case was dirty, the CD inside was scratched.I informed the seller that they sent the wrong CD. The seller told me that he would issue me a full refund if I sent back the CD and also asked me to please give him a good review on amazon, which I thought was strange since I was in the middle of a bad experience.I asked him if he was going to send me the correct CD, in which he finally told me, he did not have it.I told him that i was not going to give a good review, I was not going to send back the CD and I do not want a refund as I thought the whole experience lacked integrity. I would not recommend buying from this seller."
3,Great from a historical perspective,"This book (written when my dad was still in school) provides such information as how to write programs on punch cards, and format the output onto a line printer. This is the FORTRAN that many mathematicians, scientists, and engineers got their start on. While the book, and the version of FORTRAN presented, is clearly dated, it is filled with interesting and practical problems. If you are interested in learning FORTRAN as it is used today, this may not be the best, but from a historical perspective... in a word punchcards."
2,"Yo, yo, yo, you know what I want for Christmas? I want one of those there Nerf footballs, right?","This CD features pretty boring, mostly instrumental, bass heavy versions of well known Christmas songs. The best tracks are the two by the Big Classic, which are at least a little funny. Other than that, I can't think of anything good to say about this album."
3,Hilarious!,"Have a Very Bass Christmas packs a selection of Christmas music classics done up in full-on cheesy maximum bass style. I think it is hilarious; great for the x-mas party or when you want the old people to leave. Give it to the tasteless young subwoofer-owner in your life, or people who like kitch. Guaranteed to rattle your windows if you have the speakers for it. Note: Heidimo is not responsible for any speaker damage resulting in playing this cd. May be harmful to your ears, your insides, and your sense of taste!"
1,My book didn't arrive and Amazon didn't do nothing to help me,I didn't receive my book yet and my date to complain is expired because the salesman told me to waiting more 6 daysWhat Can I do?
3,Not what I hoped,"I'm sorry to say that this book didn't help much with my grief. It said the basic things that my family and friends have told me--and that is fine--but not what I was looking for. I was hoping for something deeper. It was also very short and could have been priced lower for that reason. I'm reading a book now of similar title called ""When Your Pet Dies: How To Cope With Your Feelings"" by Jamie Quackenbush and so far have gotten more out of the first chapter than the book I am reviewing now. I mention this other book only because it addressed my feelings of guilt right off the bat and I know others may be feeling the same way. I'm not too crazy about the fact that in the preface, Mr. Quackenbush said he gave up his 2 dogs and left them in a shelter with the possibility of euthanization when he had to move away... but I'll save that for his book review when I finish it."
4,OK,Not sure this is any better than any other chalk but was the same as supplied with the Tajima chalk line so I went with it. If it's readily available I would buy it again.
5,Best chalk available,"This is the best chalk in my opinion and half the reason the Tajima chalk line works so well.Super fine chalk that sticks to the line, and gives a clean crisp snap every time."
3,Four Good Tunes,"Systematic's first release ""Somewhere in Between"" is one of my favorite recent metal albums, so when I decided to buy their sophmore release I thought I wouldn't be disappointed--I was. There are four good tunes: ""Infected,"" ""They Say (My Soul was Lost),"" ""Where We Live and Die,"" ""Leaving Only Scars."" ""Leaving Only Scars"" is the softest, but the lyrics are decent and the song is well structured. These four songs could have been on their first album. The rest of the tunes not mentioned are awful. I get the sense that Systematic is ripping off Metallica from the 1990's, that's the last band you want to rip off. If you can buy this CD used, do it. Don't waste you money for four decent songs. Three stars is being generous."
3,Where are they going?,"This album is not quite as good as their last album. Gone are the vocals with real emotion and great lyrics to match. Gone are the catchy guitar hooks. Gone is the actually talented drumming. Gone is the bass player all together.This CD is so mediocre. Especially the drummer, who plays very basic, repetitive drum patterns that get kind of irritating. The vocalist has changed his singing style from Somewhere In Between. His voice is a bit annoying on this album (in my opinion). It kind of sounds like the band is trying to sound like Metallica or something.If you liked the first CD, you might want to give this album a listen to before you buy. I didn't. I just bought it because of how much I liked their first album."
4,Systematic's Sophmore Release,"'Pleasure To Burn' is Systematic's second album released late 2003. This is infact a continuation from their debut album with crashing guitar riffs and a turn toward the fine line between hard rock and dark metal. If you like bands like 'Godsmack, Staind or Linkin Park', you should enjoy systematic because this band who went on the road with each band has matured and learnt their lessons from the road and brought onboard two new band members. This is hard rock with bits and pieces of smashing metal and snarling menacing vocals.The best songs on this album for me were 'Not Like You', 'Right Before You' and 'Shine'."
3,Decent Disc With One Stunning Song,"In many ways you could call this typical post-grunge hard rock. The tunes are decent, mostly radio-ready dark rockers with a bit of an Alice In Chains feel to both the melodies and the delivery.But right in the middle of this decent, but not captivating, disc is 'Right Before You', which is so strong it makes the tunes around it vaporize. The lyrics are pretty standard, but delivered with gutsy power. And the chorus is a beautiful, slow-rolling groove that will stick in the mind of any fan of heavy riffs. This song is so damn good that it pretty much justified the price of the disc for me. I hope the band has more like this in store."
5,5 Stars Go to this Heavy Album.,"This album is a wonderfull example, of a heavy hitting hard rock album. If you are looking for rap rock, this is the wong place. This album is straight forward heavy rock with good lryics and a singer you can understand! These are qualities you only dream of in a rock band. Well now they are here with Systematic. While you have this album why dont you pick up there debut somewere in between?"
3,What Kind Of Band Are We?,"Systematic masterminds Tim Narducci(vocals) and Adam Ruppel(guitars) have a slight problem. They can't quite decide what they want to do. Their sound ranges from AIC/Soundgarden sludge, ""Infected"" and ""Leaving Only Scars,"" to more Metallica-like riffs, ""Pleasure To Burn"" and ""My Soul Was Lost."" Narducci's vocals are well done, but again suffer from the above problem. Considering their 1st record was mostly a metal affair, I was surprised, but not disappointed, in the change. Everything here rocks and doesn't sound as weighed down as their last offering. Now if only they can decide where to go from here."
4,So sad and tragic,"A real walk in the step of losing one's memory and indentity and how it affects the people close to the fading person. Very sad and depressing, but a breath of courage on the part of a man rarely shown. A man who not just stands by, but assumes responsibility for the person he loves and her tragic diagnosis and life as it forever changes and then ends. If you have the courage, watch it. You will not forget it."
1,Rene Touzet,Rene Touzet was an all-time great of the 40's and 50's. He had a unique Latin sound that is still prevalent today. He is one of the fore-runners of the Latin Cha-Cha. You will not be disappointed with his music.Dolores
4,Intro to Flamenco Guitar,I have found this book to be a very useful tool in helping me to better understand the methods used to play Flamenco Style Guitar. I look forward to progressing in my lessons with future method studies.
5,Lenox Opal Innocence,Exactly what the bride wanted! and very easy to get. The box was just a regular amazon box with just a little bubble wrap separating the plates but the plates suffered no damage.
5,Great chalk,"Bought this to use with the Tajima thin line chalk line and i love it. It's easy to wipe off when you are done or if you made a mistake, it coats very well, and its very visible. Would recommend."
5,Wonderful book,"I am reading this book, Moral Conflict, and I recommend it very highly. Intercultural conflict in today's rapidly shrinking world is almost inevitable. The authors bring many practical models which help increase one's options in resolving conflict situations. I VERY highly recommend the book."
3,"It's not Le Guide Culinaire, but it's functional.","I think this book is ok. Scott is selling pots and pans on qvc now. It's not a great cookbook, but it is ok with some good dishes that many people could adapt easily to make their own which is what Chef Scott was trying to explain in the book."
4,Editor's note,"This book is the result of two workshop whose goals were to open up the dialog between researchers in visualization and data mining, two key areas involved in data exploration. Publication was delayed for many reasons and MK agreed to publish the workshop proceedings.It was difficult to do provide a historical record (thus all the workshop papers) and at the same time elegant content for future readers. A balance was struck - additional tutorials provided, some organization, and edited papers. The result should be viewed in that context: a collection of papers, some of which are tutorial, some idealized positions, some seminal in nature, and some provocative. These are the works of creative and insighful individuals and I am pleased to see them disseminated."
3,Good for kids...,"When I was much younger, I adored this video! Now it's a bit cheesy, but it still holds a good message for young children, and young girls in particular.One bit of trivia...Dawn's love interest in this episode is played by current TV/movie star/director Zach Braff of ""Scrubs"" and ""Garden State"" fame!"
1,Did not care for this one at all,"First, let me say that I like minimalist books (less is often more when it comes to literature). But this novel left me feeling as if I had read nothing at all -- it's true that for an hour or so my eyes passed over a series of words strung together -- but I had virtually no reaction to what I had read"
4,Wonderful discovery,"What an interesting story. The writing was smooth, which made the story flow right along. I read this book in one day. The story centers around the main character named Hiawatha Jackson better known as Daddy Big Bucks. At first glance you take Daddy to be just a shoe shine person....but looks can be deceiving and in the case of Daddy they are completely wrong. For a three dollar deluxe shoe shine Daddy Big Bucks would give the managers his thoughts and knowledge of the various economic trends, stock market and people in general. In this story Daddy Big Bucks teaches us how we can achieve our own American Dream, by owning our own business or by rising to the top in the corporate world. As Daddy points out in the story just because you made it to the top of the corporate ladder and the only African American at the top; doesn't mean you get to stay on top. You find that there are some winner and losers in this story.Reviewed by Jocelyn Lawson for www.avid-readers.com"
3,Can't play it,I have the enhanced version. I get an excellent video but the other songs that are on the CD seem irretrievable. Am I doing d something wrong?
5,Something Special,"Could not believe that only 2 singles were ever pulled from a great album like this. But yet again like some have said even though how great the songs are on this album they are a little bit on the darker side. This is as country as you will ever hear George Strait. Every single song is traditional country there is no pop country or any electric guitars used on this one. So many great songs on this one like You Sure got this ol redneck feelin blue, Leftys gone,In too Deep, Haven't you heard, Dance time in Texas, I've seen that look on me a thousand times,and I believe that that is basically nearly the whole album. The two singles were great but there are just too many songs ignored on a great album like this. This to me looks like his first all around great album with all 10 songs of great country. Much better than Does Fort Worth ever cross your mind."
3,Its good for younger people,I dont really like the smell of this....its too sweet. But my 13 year old step daughter loves it and wears it all the time.
3,Yes and No (so far),The good. Pulls i-tunes playlist wuth remarkable fidelity. Does not require i-tunes to be turned on at the computer or it can play a track different to that playing on the computer.The bad. I have spent several hours trying to get it to connect with Squeezenetwork and to get it to play internet radio without success.
2,"I wanted it to work, but gave up in the end - unending dropouts","I have used a the squeezebox and the rokulabs M500 & M1001. The squeezebox promised a lot, but failed to deliver. Setup over the wireless network was not a problem, but slimserver (open source) was a pain. It consistently failed to locate all my songs, but the real reason for abandoning the aqueezebox was the consistent dropout. The unit was 12 ft across a room from the wireless router and the Rokulabs M500 I replaced it with has performed flawlessly, so I suppose that the flaw was with the slimserver software. In the end, whilst I appreciated the flexibility of the software, I prefer the reliability of iTunes and Rokulabs."
3,It is not a mobil device,"Good product but becareful, it is not a mobil device.You need to connect it to speakers and it doesn t have batery."
2,Upsets??,"After having been reading this book several times, I felt something wrong with the title. Then I read the column Evans On Chess in Chess Life, issue Jan/Feb 2001, I agreed with them. Many games in this books can hardly be the upsets. GM lost to GM; Champion vs Challenger's games can't be graded as such. Usually, a strong player losing to a much weaker player or the player with substantial advantage blowing the game (Reshevsky's own game, page 180) could be put in this catergory. Anyway there are many good games in this book; and the lesson here is even the champions can make mistake too.Reshevsky, Korchnoy and Larsen are in the book; but Nimzowitch, Euwe, Geller, and Bronstein (one of my mentor) are NOT!!!Another interesting point GM Larry Evans showed was the game between Euwe-Alekhine on pages 78 and 91 are identical but with some slightly different notes."
3,Madden 08,I think EA had some problems making Madden 08 on ps3 because I don't feel that I am in the game. I will suggest you guys Madden 09 because it has better graphics and that game can compete with Xbox 360 version.
3,It depends,Im sorry i cant play this game unless i have put my NCAA player in the draft for madden 08.. it's the only reason i play it.. other than that i would'nt play it.. but im looking foward to the 09 version..
2,Updated Rosters,Basically this game is a roster update. It is a bit better than '07 but had flaws galore!
1,ea not getting any better!,"This game is garbage I had high hopes for the Ps3 but it still looks real bad. The sidelines look corny, the players look alike, you can barely hear the announcing , its like static radio play by play or something. EA sports just doesnt get it. The crowd is color cordinated whats that all about this isn't queer eye makeover. I want better graphics like 1080 i should look like I want the players to actually look like there running instead of jogging. Plus whats with the quarterback tiptoing backword make him run out of the pocket not do the moon walk out of the pocket. EA should be sued for even releasing this. Trust me Don't buy it wait till madden 2020 cause thats when they will probably get it right!!!"
2,Madden Online Gamer.....,"I love Madden, well in better terms, I'm obsessed with it. I've been playing Madden for over ten years, starting with the PS1 and right on through until PS2!This new PS3 version stinks!!!The graphics were amazing, the gameplay was garbage. The players moved stiffly and the passing wasn't smooth.Madden is an artform, hopefully with the new Madden '09 coming out in August, they will have the bugs worked out and they arent releasing the new game on PS2, so I'll be forced to upgrade to the PS3!Disappointed, but still playing Madden '08 on the PS2 online! Bring it on!"
3,"Still waiting for AI(ntelligence), not AC(heating)","Good: Good graphics, fun game play, lots of featuresBad: Occasional slowdown, brutally cheap AI, too big of disparity between rookie and pro, too many turnovers, sluggish response (snapping ball, passing, switching players), they must have exhausted the budget prior to programming sideline graphics. The sideline players look and behave like cheerleaders."
1,Totally dissapointed in PS3 version,"This game really sucked. How in the world can this game be worse than the PS2 version of Madden 2008 in graphics and in gameplay? First of all, the player faces are not like the real players. The animations aren't fluid. Plus, it reminds me too much of NFL2K5, which came out a in 2004. I was so dissapointed, I actually wrote the producers of Madden a letter telling them to change the game or it won't sell like it should. Needless to say, I traded this game in. Unless they change the game, I will never by another Madden game for the PS3, again."
1,WHAT HAPPENED????!!!!,SO I FINALLY WAIT TO GET A PS3 (A YEAR LATER)...AND CAN'T SEEM TO CONTAIN MYSELF WITH GETTING MADDEN 08 FOR THE PS3..A FRIEND COMES OVER AND LENDS ME THE GAME (PLANNING TO BUY WITHIN 2 DAYS). CONCLUSION: I HAVE TO SAY IT IS THE WORSE MADDEN GAME EVER!WHAT SEEMED TO BE MY FAVORITE GAME TO PLAY HAS BECOME MY WORST NIGHTMARE. ALL I CAN IS THAT EA SPORTS NEEDS A LOT OF WORK NEXT YEAR. THEY ARE LOSING THEIR TOUCH.. IF ANY OF YOU READS THIS AND WORKS FOR EA SPORTS..PLEASE SAVE MADDEN! GOOD THING THAT I DID NOT BUY IT..I WOULD HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR A REFUND AND AN APOLOGY.
1,Madden 08 PS3,"Game is a piece of bug-filled garbage, Rushed to market without testing and has frustrated me like no other video game in my life on any console.Its not just the PS3 version, It appears to have many problems on any system.If you want to waste money then buy this game."
5,"madden nfl,08","as always this game is awesome,i can`t get enough of playing time,the kids are haunting me every ten minutes to have a turn,life stinks should have bought two systems and two games,ha.next time."
4,GREAT GAME,"Every thing was great. The graphics are awesome. The Franchise mode was good. My only problem was that it was way too hard to be a quarterback in superstar mode. You would get sacked many times, until you started throwing interceptions instead. If you buy this game, make sure you play franchise or online modes."
3,Could have done better,"the delay in the passing mode really gets to me, not as quick as it needs to be. To many buttons you need to learn, but its ok for as long as its been made over the years."
1,"fumble, fumble, fumble","the cpu on all madden level is impossible.CPU:1) Breaks tons of tackles2) Gets big plays whenever it needs3) Causes fumbles often4) Can't be blockedHUMAN:1) CPU controlled players always out of position2) Tackled for loss almost every running play3) No matter what team you pick lineman get blown off the line of scrimmage4) Drop, drop drop passes5)...This list goes on forever.The bottom line is that the cpu can do things that the human player can't do and they won't let the cpu controlled players do it for you.I wish I was a beta tester I'd let them know that the game sucked. I don't know who they get to test these games out, but they are seriously lacking."
4,Rocks up the feild,This game is so freakin fun. I love it because it is not some stupid game were the feild looks chesey and the crowd dosen't look like dots. So make sure to get this game because it freakin rocks.
1,Not worth buying,"Probably one of the worst Madden I have play. This game is too interception friendly, CB would do near impossible 360 turn to intercept the ball at full speed. I hate how a defense linemen can jump 10ft in the air to intercept your ball. They took away the run, defense linemen can run faster than your RB. They can tackle you from 2 feet away. No point of throwing a deep ball, your WR's AI is too dumb to catch it. Someone get injured almost every play and the challenge play is a joke, they gave you the worst camera angle possible. Graphic are not even Ps3 quality. Don't waste your money on this game."
2,Not a good use of technology!,"I've played Madden 08 on PS3 & PS2, and I have to say with out a doubt the PS2 is better. The PS2 game play feels more real, it's easier to change to a different player during the pre-snap, the menues are easier to navigate, etc.I can't believe I spent $400 on a PS3 and wish I had my PS2 back.Obviously the PS3 is still new and Madden will eventually get better on this playform, but at least put out a product better than the PS2."
2,This is garbage,EA sports puts out a PS2 game for the PS3 system. I can't believe this. The graphics are so boring and looks like you can play it on a PS2 don't bother EA sports is losing my touch.
1,Massively Disappointing,"I was willing to forgive the first version of Madden for PS3 for having way less functionality than the PS2 version, but version two should have caught up. For basic playability there is improvement in running between the tackles and short passing.However, on the strategic front PS3 is a big step backwards. You can't do player substitution - that makes it inconvenient to platoon RB's and impossible to platoon at any other position or to have a ""fast receivers"" set. There is no way to disguise the zone or matchup CB's to WR's in a zone. There are very few audibles. Finally, and most exasperatingly turnovers are completely out of control. In a game with 10 minute quarters I am averaging 9 takeaways a game even with the interception slider at ""5"" out of ""100"".On the whole I can't recommend this game to anyone."
1,SOO disappointed..,"They revamped the whole game, so even starting a quick game so Brady could throw a bomb to Moss was confusing. Once I got the game up, again they changed everything. Picking a play has changed. Change for the sake of changing as it didn't make it easier. Players are smaller, you can't change your view or the field, can't change audio settings, No Madden or Michaels or any intelligent play by play. In fact, one of the worst and poorly thought-out pieces is after you have picked your teams, Marshall Faulk comes on to give you his prediction. It is always canned, never smooth and always wrong. NE vs. Oak, he said ""this one won't be close, (long pause) Oak 34, (long pause) NE 10"". Game in NE. (I know I am a Pats fan, but this happened 4 times I played.) I have had the game for just one night but so far just really disappointing. This is what you get for product when you stop competition. I am going to see if I can find update rosters for past games. Yes, it is that bad."
1,In game advertising sucks,"Every time you get into the red zone, some annoying underArmour pop up ad appears. Having a UA billboard wouldn't have been that big of a deal, but having it pop-up and impede game play is unacceptable.Boycott this game, unless you want this trend to continue."
2,BOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!,I have to boo this latest installment of madden 08. its better than 07 only in the gameplay aspect. The weapons option is a big improvment to the feel of the game but thats it. graphics are terrible ( i own the ps3 version) and the controls are just as bad. the game as a overall whole just feels different. Plus the fact that there is no type of help in the game as far as controls. The framerate issue really pisses me off too. Ive already punted the ball for 15-25 yards because of the hick-up when you start the kick meter. the players run like they cant move the upper half of their bodies. i think the models looked better on 07 for the ps2. i will continue to play because i am a madden junkie. but the overall presentation of the game is unacceptable. VERY DISSAPOINTING
5,Excellent introduction to this issue,"Even though Rifkin doesn't start talking about hydrogen until the seventh chapter, he lays out a convincing case for why we need to shift away from fossil fuels. Even though I disagreed with some of Rifkin's philosophical conclusions on why we need to switch, the facts (that we are nearing the peak production of oil, that the remaining oil is held by Islamic states that are politically unstable and global warming is increasing) are hard to dispute. I wouldn't suggest this as the only book to read on the hydrogen economy but it should be the first one you read."
1,Skip it!,I suggest you read the article in Scientific American about Hydrogen Automobiles. It is shorter and probably better in terms of content. I think it is the September or October 02 issue.
3,Addendum...,"As a followup to my other review here on Rifkin's ""Hydrogen Economy,"" I have recently finished reading and highly recommend ""Tomorrow's Energy: Hydrogen, Fuel Cells, and the Prospects for a Cleaner Planet"" by Peter Hoffmann as a better book for explaining the nuts and bolts of a hydrogen economy. Think of Rifkin's book as the ""why"" and Hoffman's book as the ""how."" Read them both for a very complete picture.For a truly exciting read with more personal drama about some of the leaders who are making all of this happen, I highly recommend ""Powering the Future: The Ballard Fuel Cell and the Race to Change the World"" by Tom Koppel. Very objective and even-handed. After reading this book, you'll find yourself wanting to buy stock in Ballard (Nasdaq:BLDP)."
4,Best Illustrator!,"The illustrations by the author are worth the effort in finding this book. His style is gentle and leave enough to the imagination to fill in for the child as well as the adult. This artist has been known in the art community for decades, and his childrens' book Greedy Blackbird, and Lonely Squirrel are the two known to me."
4,great info,book is filled with great info and is an easy read. wish the price was lower considering the quantity of information.
2,Too stiff,"I didn't care for this dishwashing brush. The bristles were so stiff, I had trouble getting it into the corners and grooves of square pans and bakeware. I am keeping it, though, to clean other items that need a good stiff brush (grill, etc.)"
3,Turfer Rain Pants,"Nice pants, fit well and they were great for walking the dog in the rain. Unfortunately, I am a backpacker and I cannot recommend them for hiking. I found that the Navy 2XL that I purchased seep water through the fabric during the rain. They are dry enough for 30 minutes or so but after an hour I was soaked underneath. I rate them a 3 because they will work for home use. I'm off to purchase something else for my hikes."
3,No problem.,"Seems fine to me. Actually I haven't used them yet, but I'm sure they'll come in handy, so I'm glad to have them. Service was very good."
2,Some Assembly Required,"As soon as I took the unit out of the box screws were falling off from the bottom. I came to plug in the appliance and the socket caved in and it would not work. I had to open the unit and fix the screws which kept the casing to the transformer, I also replaced a part in the socket so it can be used and it worked. The thing is that the unit was well priced and I did enjoy the diy. Perhaps suppliers should have written 'Some Assembly Required' on the box. Till now it seems to be working fine."
4,Great Transformer,"Hooked it up right out of the box and it works great, the price was lower than anything available in the PX."
5,A childhood favorite...,"I bought this book as an adult, having read it repeatedly in libraries as a child. I can honestly say that the fondness with which I remembered it was well-deserved. The plot is clever, the illustrations are charming, and the theme is laudable. If you're looking for a book that teaches children the wisdom of enjoying things in moderation, this could do it. It's also just a fun read with endearing characters. I was delighted that it was just as lovely as I thought it was when I was little."
5,ViTaMiN-A break beatz that go bump in your MIND,"This disc is unique, it is one that should start off, the liquid -A- listening library of anyone interested in going insane/ The beatz are mean, fast, and SPACED-OUT!!! A definite recommendation for the peeps out there, who also love to travel into the alternate universes! If your ever in town just ask for the: 3-1-8 BoyZ (WE HooK it up!)"
5,Absolutely beautiful,"It is an absolutely beautiful album. The choir itself and the music is just awesome. I highly recomend this album to anyone. It brings peace to those who are listening to it. The first track, ""I am the Day"" is the best track, in my opinion."
2,Nothing fancy,"Heard the song ""Ave Maria"" from youtube.com and decided to buy this album. Overall its the only song that is well sang in the album while the others, well, not bad but not good as well. Since the price of the album is cheap therefore, cheap product with cheap quality. That's fair."
2,"Looks nice, but not very solid.","We chose this dresser for our daughters' room. Needed something with alot of room for both their clothes and that didn't take up too much floor space (and looked nice). Although it functions great in those regards, the dress itself is not very sturdy, we often have to ""twist"" it to get the drawer fronts to line up evenly. And then the drawer fronts keep falling off! After numerous attempts to get them on tight, we will now be glueing them...we'll see if that works. We also fear that it could easily tip over, the top is solid wood. (Recommend an anti-tip device for it.) Overall, wish I would not have bought something so tall. Girls can't reach the top drawers anyhow..."
3,Older version of COBOL Programmer swing with JAVA.,"rdder it because it was very cheap ( the shipping was more than the price of the book ) and since it was delivered some time after my copy of COBOL Programmers Swing with JAVA, I noticed that it started out exactly the same. My recommendation Buy the updated version instead.... (same author should have clued me in, live and learn)..."
3,Haven't read it,"The only thing I know is that the author, E. Reed Doke is a pretty poor JAVA teacher, so I don't know how he can explain it in a book."
4,Great 60's surf music by way of the 80's,"Excellent recapturing of the 60's surf sound with an 80's spin makes for a terrific soundtrack album. Even Frankie Avalon's conservative vocals can't ruin the infectious ""California Sun"" and Annette Funicello takes another crack at ""Jamaica Ska"" (she did it many years ago on one of her beach party albums)and fares slightly better with the assist of Redbone. Best track by far is ""Sun, Sun, Sun, Sun,Sun"" with it's oft-repeated and totally rippin' ""let's go"" lyric punching up the great beat throughout. ""Catch a Ride"" used over the film's opening title's is an excellent track also. The 80's new wave tunes fare less well but the 60's stuff makes this a can't miss soundtrack."
5,"Shooting Colt Single Actions in All Styles, Calibers, & Generations","Mike Venturino wrote this book a while ago for those who enjoy shooting Colt Single Action Army revolvers (1873) and other SA Colts but its appeal goes far beyond that small select group of hobbyists. While I have never fired a Colt SA I love this book. It led to Mike's next book ""Shooting Six Guns of the Old West"", an equally enthralling read. Whether one's interest be as a shooter, historian or a simple afficionado one is likely to enjoy Venurino's specialized books."
4,The Golden Bridge: A Guide to Assistance Dogs for Children Challenged By Autism or other Developemntal Disabilities.,I found the book very informative when working with the child and matching the dog to the person. I am sure this book will be used alot in the future.
5,Amazing mukimono.,"I have known Chef David Larousse for many years, and I remember when he completed his first book, Edible Art. This revision is quite gorgeous, and one can see how he has moved his craft along after more than fifteen years. The photography and illustrations are fabulous as well. A must-have for every chef, especially those who use vegetable and fruit carving now and then."
5,The Smartest Girl.,This is my favorite book because it is about a smart little girl.This book is about a girl how had to go to a new school.She had to go to a new school beacause she had past her test.Her name is Ruby Bridges.Two or three girls was coming too.She had to go to an all white school.On her first day of school some people had picked her up.Her mother came with her.Then they finally got there.The man told her do not look back.People was harassing her.She was the only student.It was a new teacher because nobody else wanted to teach her.This is a good book to read.
5,The Story of Ruby Bridges,"What a wonderful and captivating story that everytime I read touches my heart. A true story for all ages, about one little girls courage and determination to excell at her education and overcome a world full of hate. This book does not just teach segragation but also the importance of standing up for yourself when the world is against you. This little girl helps not just in the past but here in the present us all see what a little hope and pray can do. I truly reccomend everyone reads this story to themselves and their children, Ruby's message will stay in your heart..."
2,The Story Of Ruby Bridges Misleading,"I was disappointed with this book because of the illustration, it did not show white people as they are ""White"" but instead as brown skinned people.I do not want to confuse my son with these misleading images, so I will not buy any more books of this nature illustrated by GEORGE FORD.Additionally, the story is too shallow and not very in depth."
2,Disappointed some,The book was a good book but I have to say for the price there wasn't a whole lot to it. I paid almost as much for S & H as I did the book and there was very little in it. Sorry.
1,Where's the outrage?!?!?!?!?!?!?,"This book is absolutely terrible! It contains explicit religious content (Christian, no less;-) for no reason at all. More importantly, this story is taken SO FAR out of context, it looses ALL meaning and emotional impact. Why are the white people so mad? Why are the children segregated in the first place? I don't know for which grade this is intended; but whichever it is, the students ask those questions.One of the author's more recent books is on Bruce Springsteen, OK? 'Nuff Said?If you see Robert Coles, wish hateful stuff on him for me.The illustrator is culpable by association."
