4,cheaper online,"I got the first dose at the vet and I am waiting for the refill from Amazon. Much cheaper than the vet. It also works great for my dog, he has had stomach/stool issues for years. Finally something that is easy to give him and it works."
5,Highly Recommended,"I can highly recommend this Blu ray.A most enjoyable ballet and I loved the music.It's fun, in HD.Great costumes.I have already watched it twice in two days."
2,A little boring to my taste,"The set is charming and sunny in the beginning, the chicken dance is absolutely hilarious. There are lots of humor from the leading dancers, and off course Widow Simone steals part of the show with the clog dance.However halfway through show, the plot is getting predictable, and become less interesting.The dancing is all right, nothing much to say on the technical side.A funny and charming ballet, well that's pretty much it."
5,Two Thumbs Up!,"This album is great to listen to almost anywhere. I like to listen to mine while I'm driving. Even my young kids like it so much that they already know what specific track number to request to listen to. I especially like #7 (""On the Road to Zion""), #3 (""Evil Doers""), and #12 (""Push Up the Praise""). I hope and pray that this album will reach all those who need a touch from the Lord. Although it is reggae, I believe this form of music can reach many people who may have never even considered listening to it. God bless the songwriter (and his family who I know support him), and may he continue to allow God to inspire him. God put a vision in him that he needs to carry on throughout his music ministry.I trust that all who listen will be blessed by this Christian reggae project! Enjoy!!!"
3,Review,I feel the color is a bit yellow looking. A table cloth solved that issue. One of the cushions was dirty with some kind of smudge and did not totally come off. One chair wobbles...could be assembler issues. There is a small crack on a side pannel of the underside. The chairs have dowl wholes on the underside of the top bar for no apparent reason. I guess for the price one can't expect perfection. It is a comfortable table to eat from.
4,Driscoll is NOT Janis Joplin,"Much of the material on this disc, especially the Auger titles, have nothing to do with Jools. The instrumentalwork ""Fool Killer"" & ""Kiko"" show the jazz underpinings of Auger's Oblivion Express. I was not impressed by"" Oh, baby won't you come back home to Croyden"" however. It's as if Auge & Trinity only share disc space with Driscoll.To sample Jools I highly recommend ""I know You Love Me Not"". This song brings comparisons to Dusty Springfield' s ""The Look Of Love"" and Burt Bacharach's production style, it's 60's sophisticated and powerful.I broke out my vinyl lp Jools & Brian for comparison. The liner notes quote EYE magazine's ""the Janis Joplin ofGreat Britain"" label for Ms Driscoll, she's not close. Her later works were much stronger but ""I Know You Love Me Not"" is almost worth the price."
2,Nothing great about this book,"The regular stuff with no new technologies covered. No great mention about the impact of E-business and SFAs role in Ebusiness. Nothing visionary, the general SFA thoughts."
3,Interesting...,"As with other people that sorta fit into the Female Vocal/New Age/Misc. catagory This album has it's own flavour. I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed it, however (isn't there always a however) as with others of this genre (Enya being the paradigm.) I find that after a while, you encounter yourself looking for something more, that really never emerges. As a result, I would recommend this album to anyone looking for music that is audially interesting, yet requires no concentration, as I like to call it ""Filler Tunes"". I give it a 2 out of 10 weeks that it will live in your cd player."
1,Red VistaQuest VGA Digital Camera,"Terrible quality. I do not recommend buying this item, even if they asked $5 for it. Junk."
3,A history of conflict in Afghanistan.,"For much of this book, I learned much about the history of Afghanistan and the people who make up this troubled country. Up till the last chapter, it was a really interesting read. Then Griffiths starts talking about his viewpoint on the Taliban and why the West should negotiate with the Taliban government. Griffiths states that America is out for revenge following the September 11, 2001 attacks, and has picked on Afghanistan. I don't know much about Griffiths' politics, but I do know he didn't know anyone who died on September 11, 2001. Much of what the world knows about the Taliban after they lost control of the country show them to be a narrow minded religious party out to remake the modern world and turn the clock back. And Griffiths thinks we should negotiate with them.For those who want to read this interesting book, rip out Chapters 14 and 15. They don't make much sense, so why read those chapters."
1,Not expected,"The CD is fine got here in time, really no complaints with the seller. Just wish I would have taken the time to look at what's on the CD. The one song I wanted on it wasn't even on it, the whole thing is just music, waste of money in my opinion."
2,sopranos suck peppers and eggs,"two good songs on one disc, one by kasey chambers, a country and western singer from australia (go figure) and a song by ""cake""the second disc is even worse. one decent song by bob dylan"
1,Too eclectic for me and I love the show,"I love the show and the music that goes with it but this is one of the worst CD's I have ever purchased. The music is all mixed up with fast and slow, familiar and obscure. It does not help put you in the mood when you watch the show. I can't think of when I would listed to this CD again. Who the heck picked this compilation?"
2,Stereo sound - not worth it!!,Whats the point in spending 25 quid and getting two badly mixed cds in SACD stereo? Multichannel makes the difference in SACDs. This one is not worth the price!
3,End of Season 2?,I'm looking for the song played during the montage at the end of season 2 during Meadow's graduation party. A slow bluesy song that picks up at the end during the credits. If anyone can help out it would be greatly appreciated!
3,Not Like The First,"Basically, a disappointing album. Nothing like the first! I admit,though, the dialogue at the end is great."
5,Well Worth the Investment,"Nigeria tends to get short-shrift in the travel guidebooks; rarely is it featured, and it is commonly maligned. This even-handed treatment of Africa's most populous country dishes out the treats that Nigeria has in store for the traveller as well as the negatives. In short, if one exercises common sense and stays alert to his surroundings, Nigeria can be a rewarding experience. The author is a fearless youngster eager to try everything, but also allows for an older person's expatriated sensibilities, understanding that not every traveller wants to camp or lodge in youth hostels (a common ailment in the Lonely Planet travel serials). She finds the warmth in the people that is a common Nigerian trait, and allows the reader to experience that warmth with her. There is no cold, clinical distance from her subject(s). This book is well worth the investment."
1,Offensive and lazy writing,"I reluctantly accepted this book from a friend as I am a Nigerian and thought I didn't need a guide but my husband was visiting and I wanted him to have some ideas about things he would like to do.Firstly, the Publishers should have attempted to find a writer who didn't despise the country to write the book. She writes some many negative things that it was hard to read. Often saying things like 'nothing works.' and 'it's dilapitated'.Is was also patronising in many parts for example when she says 'Nigerians are dumbfounded to see foreigners on the street.' Nigeria has many expatriates and nobody bats an eyelid when a non Nigerian walks past.Terrible book."
2,Warning Printing Error Page Missing From Brand New Book,I bought the book and set a few months ago(Brand new and factory sealed). It is a nice little set. I have not used any of the spells. It is a basic little set more for entertainment. Last night I did a reading for myself. I found a card defenition missing from the book. On page 35 it should have the info for Lady of forbidden love. Instead it has a reprint of the title page for the book. This is a major printing error. I just wanted to warn everyone who may purchase the set. I just contated the publisher to let them know.
1,"Lots of vapor, little substance...","You'd get more & better advice out of 2 panels of Dilbert than from this messy compilation of uninsightful bromides. This is like getting one of those ""Get Yourself Organized"" books that spends all its time telling you WHY to get organized (& not very specifically, either) but never HOW to get organized. A totally self-indulgent exercise by author & publisher."
1,Bitter perspective uninspiring,"I was very unimpressed with this effort. This book was a bitter book that was not well written nor well edited. I'm still grasping for the point, and what use it would be for most. I want things I can use - that's why I buy these things. I just didn't find it useful. A poor effort from what I'm finding to be a poor company (this is my third - and last - purchase from this publisher, and I haven't enjoyed any of these books. I sense a trend)"
5,Overbeck by Kathleen Postle,"Very good informative book on pottery and china painting artists. The Overbeck sisters were gifted in the field of ceramics;however, much more should be said for their design in the china painting field. Collectors would be amazed what this book contains."
5,best school textbook ever,"my enligh teacher at a certain portland, or community college used this as his textbook, and it was the best class i have ever spent money on, fun, interesting, and exposed us to lots of alternative writers"
4,Sabro-son,"Sensacional chicos, esta gente son incombustibles. Atención padres... mi bebé de 10 meses alucina oyendo el vacilón-cha-cha-cha y por supuesto Maria Cristina."
4,Sabro-son,"Sensacional chicos, está gente son incombustibles. Atención padres... mi bebé de 10 meses alucina oyendo el vacilón-cha-cha-cha y por supuesto Maria Cristina."
3,Good but not as boisterous as I had hoped.,"I had hoped this CD would be filled with high spirited songs of mead-drinking debauchery, unfortunately, the songs they chose to record were a little too somber for my taste. Additionally, on some selections a baratone was used where a higher voice may have helped the mood. And, on a final note of nitpicking, some of the spoken word portions should have been done in a Elizabethan accent, not an American one. All in all, a very interesting CD, with some good music, but not quite what I had in mind."
2,Sounds like they're singing Christmas carols,"This recording is professionally produced - perhaps too much so. I've been in a few taverns and heard my share of bawdy songs. I am used to hearing them sung with gusto, with a wink and a naughty smile, to the raucous and enthusiastic appreciation of the audience. The songs on this CD are performed entirely straight. The results are technically competent but fail utterly in conveying the spirit and fun that make this genre worth listening to."
2,Very disappointed!,"I don't know what i really expected but after recieving this book, boy was i disappointed. Firstly, these type of journeys through baseball history should not be in books the size of a CD case. Secondly, the information is amazingly disjointed with no discernable pattern and thirdly the book looks like it's been put together by the folks at the Monty Python Animation Department.Don't waste your money, there are many books out there that cover the information this one does but in a nicer, more comprehensive way. A 5th graders scrapbook of a recent camping trip would hold your attention more."
4,Eye-opening and powerful,"I don't know what I was expecting when I started watching it, but I was pleasantly surprised. If it played out a bit more like a documentary than a film, the style only enhanced the horror of the facts they were trying to convey. The acting was superb, the story compelling, and it left me wanting to learn more about these issues."
1,Puncture,"Not long after his turn as Captain America, Chris Evans hit theaters again, but this time in a very small, very limited release called Puncture. Based on true events, the film focuses on a pair of Houston lawyers who agree to defend an ER nurse who's been pricked by a contaminated needle. As the attorneys delve deeper into the case, they uncover a web of conspiracy that involves a widespread medical issue and the shady underbelly of the pharmaceutical industry. I was willing to go with the story, which I found compelling, but I was a little reluctant to buy into the formulaic plotting that drove the narrative along. Puncture isn't quite the equivalent of The Insider, but it should get the job done for those looking for a passable potboiler featuring a rising star."
1,Shoot me!,This was the worst movie I have watched in two years. Poorly written and poorly acted. The good reviews must be from the producers because this movie is a stinker. Better to stare at the wall than waste $4 on this dog.
5,Fabulous,"It starts out slowly. So you have to just buckle down and stick with it. The story is excellent. The characters are compelling. Chris Evans really shines as a man you, for all intensive purposes, should loathe yet can't help but love.It is rediculous that so many of our health care workers should be in danger, and even DIE, when a perfect product exists that could end the risk. All for the sake of a few pennies. While factory farms are given goverment subsidies for water and grain so they can over produce beef we don't need. That money should go to the health care system!!!"
3,Junky Justice,"A hunky junkie crusader lawyer takes on vile corporate facists and self-serving politicians, and it's all based on a true story (just the way Hollywood likes it). This film has the kind of script and performances best served on TV; and there are plenty of opportunites here for commercial interruption. Routine at best."
3,Unpolished but solid product,"A good story from a somewhat realistic, documentary like approach; which means no theatrical story like finishes. Otherwise the final product is rough, with some start-stop transitions, some hanging plotlines, etc. Some is probably do to the acting, the directing, the writting, but all three seem to be in harmony as the quality of each does not seem to outdue the other two.Really a decent realistic story, and production in a respectable B-movie format."
2,Did nobody edit this book??,"""He lulled me into the car...""""obstain""These are just a few of the errors that jumped out at me from the pages of this poorly-organized stream of consciousness. Savage is good with words, but not good enough to take responsibility for editing his own book, as he seems to have done. This text would have benefitted from a good once-over by someone else. I will definitely ""obstain"" from reading Savage's other books."
4,very cool,"If you are looking for an interesting and very funny book, I would reccommend this. It is interesting to see the process one has to go through in order to adopt a child - gay or straight - and in his inimitable style, Dan Savage makes this an easy book to get through, while giving you many funny anecdotes to laugh at. I love his advice column, and since I am not a religious freak, I am not offended by his homosexuality. I think it is one of the truly progressive things America has to offer, allowing same sex adoption, and this book is an interesting account of it."
4,He's a great guy,"Just read this book and thoroughly enjoyed it. Decided to come on here to see what people thought, and was extatic to see most people enjoyed it. Of course there was the totally predictable religious loon who had to bring his dogmatic Christian idiocy to the table, but for most people, they will simply find a humorous and touching account of adopting a child by one of Americas funniest writers."
5,Brilliant story; but not an exploration of adoption options,"I started to read at 10:30pm and couldn't put it down until I finished the next morning. This included 3 crying-breaks and numrous occasions of laughing out loud. A very entertaining read.For those interested in detailed mechanics of various adoption options, however, this is not a ""how-to"" book. For example, only passing mention of the ""international route"" is made and the only two options really discussed and compared are domestic open vs. closed adoptions. The case for the open route is soundly made."
3,"The trials of adoption, with humor & triumph","I often enjoy Dan Savage, though I am by no means a rabid fan. I picked up _The Kid_ on a recommendation from a friend, and read through it fairly quickly. The book is a true story recounting the trials of Dan and his partner trying to adopt a child. As if the adoption process weren't rife with terrors for straight folks, Dan candidly discusses the additional hurtles he and his partner faced as gay men. As if that weren't difficult enough, the birth mother is a tough street kid with issues of her own, including alcohol and drug use, and even shows Dan and Terry where to buy drugs in her gutter-punk hang-outs.Savage does a good job of portraying the couple's anxiety as the birth looms closer and closer, with a good mixture of humor and frankness (and sometimes both at once.) Overall, it's a satisfying and entertaining story that's well-told."
5,A great book!,"I can't recommend this book enough, unless you are homophobic or have a problem with gays adopting children. This was a well-written heartwarming read that actually changed some of my views on the topic."
5,Fantastic Book!,"I have always admired Dan Savage for his cynicism and bold truth-telling as a sex-columnist. After reading his story of the adoption of his and Terry's and Melissa's son D.J., I now admire him as a son, a boyfriend, a father, a human."
5,Outstanding!,"This book had me in stitches all the way through. Yet, however entertaining, the book really presents itself wonderfully showing that same-sex couples can happily go through an adoption process and create a normal, happy family with kids. This book showed me that the changing face of the American family is possible, and ultimately inevitable. Thanks Dan!"
5,A Must Read for EVERYONE !!!,This is on my list of favorites. The writing was superb. Never have I ever read a book with so much honesty on the part of the writer. It's a must read weather your gay or not or are adopting or not. I couldn't put it down.. By the end of the story you feel as if you know each person he has written about....I hope Mr. Savage writes a follow-up book. I would be first in line to buy it.
5,Both thoughtful and enjoyable,"Dan Savage, a parent? THE Dan Savage, gay sex-column adviser, whose sarcastic take on sex and outrageous writing style have made him a cult figure in ""alternative"" publications around the country?Well, yup. In this entertaining book, Savage details the decisions and processes involved when his partner Terry and him decided to adopt, using the Portland ""open adoption"" method. Emotional without being sentimental, Savage describes his supportive family and friends (as well as the non-supportive ones), and makes no apologies for his choices. Far more than a simple ""gay couple wants baby"" polemic, this book describes the trials and tribulations of adoption faced by ALL parents; indeed, what makes it so startling is its matter-of-factness. In the end, Dan and Terry come off as no better or worse than any other prospective parents, and it is this which is probably most revolutionary. An entertaining, yet intellectual, read."
2,"Big deal, so you're gay and adopting!","So what? Dan Savage is gay and adopting, does he have to write a book about that? Just because he's a writer and has means to find a publisher to pubish his otherwise mediocre book? Don't be mistaken, I'm gay and we're going through the adoption process too but I just think he's being too melodramatic about this. I don't like the way he writes, too lengthy and long-winded. He also tends to go into the smallest details abou their lives. This is an OK book, nothing too exciting, might have more meaning if you are adopting but otehrwise, stay away from it. p/s I like his columns though..."
5,"A poignant, engrossing memoir of an adoption","I read this book in one day-- it's that good. It speaks directly to the experience of big-city gay men in the late nineties: the combination of near-total societal tolerance (if not complete acceptance) and the unprecedented possibilities we have to live a ""virtually normal"" (to use the words of another recent author) life, one that might even include adoption and child-raising. I had assumed this book would be written in the same super-jaded, outrageous style of Dan's ""Savage Love"" sex-advice column, but instead this is a moving true story of hope and possibility, written by a man who has been humbled by an experience too many gay people have assumed we'll never be able to have."
5,"Fabuluos Book, also a life changing book","I brought this book home and had my sister, that was still uneasy about me being gay, read the book. She enjoyed the book and totally changed her view about homosexuality. She now can see how homosexuals are reagular people and she wants me to learn more from Dan Savage. Oh by the way, she is 15 and this is the second English book she ever read. Anyway, buy this book for your family, your friends. It could make them understand what being gay is all about."
1,"Embarassing, offensive and shallow-TYPICAL SAVAGE","I read this book before I ever read his column which I found to be extremely stupid in its quippy sarcastic humor. Basically he makes it sound like he and his boyfriend didnt want to do the stereotypical gay couple things so then decided to adopt. His perception of the process to becoming a parent really sounds like they were getting a new accesory. In his favor, I've seen Savage on Bill Maher and enjoyed him, I just cant stand his column or this stupid book."
1,I pity the child,"Its not because he's gay, cause I am as gay as he is, but this guy is a crass, insensitive and rude and I pity the child who has to live under that influence. I can only hope that his lover is a real person, but I kind of doubt it."
1,Reasons why gay men should not be allowed to adopt,"The following is the greatest arguement against gay adoption I've ever read. Ironically (and tragically), it comes from the author: ""Having children is no longer about propagating the species . . . [it is] something for grownups to do, a pasttime, a hobby. So why not kids? Gay men need hobbies, too.""Raising a child a hobby? How can anyone consider himself ""grownup"" when he sees raising a child as nothing more than a hobby?Unfortunately for the gay community, this book provides rich fodder for those who oppose it and who oppose gay adoption. My heart break for D.J., a.k.a. ""the Kid."""
1,Poor kid,How annoying. Another author trying to carve a niche with his homosexuality. His exploitation of that poor kid into a book is indicator enough of his freakishness.
5,Undiscovered gems,"This album is a revelation. Davis brings a spontaneous joy to the art of man who experienced so much suffering in his life. The resurrection is a kind of miracle and a rare work of art. The liner notes are a valuable testament in their own right. Thank you, Mr. Davis"
5,John Davis Plays Blind Tom,"I heard selections from the CD on 29 February as part of the WETA (public radio in Washington, D.C.) salute to Black History Month. I cannot recommend it too highly. The CD combines the work of a superb pianist with extraordinarily beautiful and inventive compositions. It was a magical musical discovery for me, and I am sure that it will be for others as well."
1,Didn't purchase this product,I did purchase 2 brooches from Pugster - a snowflake and fox. I did not buy this brooch.
4,JimDandie98,"This collection is great for both children AND adults. Highlights include a Little Lulu cartoon - ""A Bout with a Trout"" - featuring the Bing Crosby tune ""Swing on a star,"" that emphasizes the importance of attending school when Lulu tries to play hooky to go fishing and three Ray Harryhausen animated fairy tales from 1947.The Fantastic Films of Ray Harryhausen - Legendary Monster Series (Jason and the Argonauts / The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad / The Golden Voyage of Sinbad / Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger / The 3 Worlds of Gulliver)"
4,Great Beginner Book,"Bernd Klinger has provided a great book for the beginner with numerous photographs to aid competitors in their pursuit. Equipment is covered in great detail along with clothing, sights, and a complete breakdown on all the positions. The photographs are detailed to show specifically what not to do and what we should all be working toward as a solid position. This book will not go into depth on the mental aspect and serious training issues dealing with competition. That is destined for a second book. This book will provide enough thought to review and diagnose a variety of situations with positions, equipment, trigger control, and breathing."
1,Disappointing,"Another reviewer praised this scanner because it scanned photos well. I would concur, but other than that this scanner is a bust. It is clumsy to use and the controls are not user friendly. Despite claiming to make use of USB 2.0 technology it is excruciatingly slow, even with plain B&W low res text. It is virtually useless for scanning multiple pages of text into, for example, a .pdf file because after each page you have to tell it what you want it to scan again. And whose idea was the black background on the lid? Since it is difficult and time consuming to set up and scan you often end up with scans that are bordered with black rather than white. Endless pixels of waste that have to be cropped and also sacrafice some of the quality of the scan. I plan on donating the scanner to the Goodwill and I kick myself for not returning it while I had the chance"
2,"reveiws are great ,product for me not great","I was in need of a scanner and after reading reviews in pcworld,pc mag and others decided on the s400. bought it locally and followed the install instructions that came with the product. First install software,then connect scanner to power and usb it to computer. I was ready for my first scan. Unfortunatly the driver for the scanner that is included did not recognize the scanner. So i called support up on my dime and was on the phone with them for over 30 minutes and they told me to download the updated driver which is on the web site. I did,uninstalled the driver that came with it and installed the new driver. It worked for about 20 min and then the scanner would not activate. So unstead of calling support again i returned it. To pay for support during the installation process is not for me. I am sure this is a fine unit,but for me it did not work."
1,Hunk of garbage,"I wish I could give this heap of trash 0 stars. The software is buggy, it installs applications that run every time you log in (Mac OS X) and they took extra time to make it unbelievably difficult to disable.The documentation is written in Chinglish, and fails to cover common problems. And get a load of their support web site's ""knowledge base""I suffered with this waste of time for a couple of months, but it just stopped bothering to show up on my USB bus. What a mistake I made buying this loser.Since this scanner died, I've replaced it with a Canon CanoScan 8400F, which is much faster and is bundled with software of much better quality. The documentation for the 8400F also seems to be written by people who speak English. The image quality from the CanoScan is also fantastic, much nicer than I'd been able to get out of the S400 (while it worked)."
1,Unbelievable what a POS,"To begin with, the first one they shipped me was DOA out of the box. After a normal amount of back-and-forth, they shipped me another one. It has never worked properly despite multiple reloads/updates/tech support emails, etc. They do not have a toll-free support line, and I got tired of spending a lot of my time and dollars getting nowhere with them. The hardware is probably quite good, but if you are not a fan of buggy software, look elsewhere!"
1,"killed by a leopard, and good riddance","so, funny story, the microtek s400 has no support for mac os x 10.5 leopard, and microtek has no plans for updated drivers. which i guess is okay, because the software was never honestly that good. the scanner hardware itself is fine, though strictly par. i did like the backlit slide adapter, but most of my slide photography needs have gone digital in the last year. i might buy another scanner for other document scanning, but its not bloody likely to be a microtek. sorry guys, you lose."
3,Terrific Shredder,"I was looking two features in a shredder: (1) cross-cut & (2) optical media shredding. None of the personal units did both, so I went with the SB-85C which is designed for small offices. The price was a little steep, but it gets the job done. In terms of functionality, the only big negative is that it is bit messy."
4,Wow!,"This book has it all. Ms. Barr weaves a masterful tale of skuldugery in the boardrooms of two high tech companies as they battle each other. The dialog is snappy, the story is intricate and never dull and the characters grab you by the throat. Power,greed and lust. Not a bad description of current affairs. Ms. Barr's career in the business world has clearly given her many insights. May her author's pen be ever fruitful!"
4,Acquisition of Power,Erika Barr shows a lot of savvy about the world of hostile takeovers in this her first outing as an author. Acquisition of Power may herald the beginning of a brand new talent in the industry.
4,MSG's best in about 20 years!,"This disk is a welcome return to the creative songwriting that filled much of his earlier solo material. There has not been much to get excited about for fans of the first 3 MSG albums, except, of course, his return to UFO for 2 great albums and hopfully more (Contraband anyone?? McAuley/Schenker? NO THANK YOU!!).Aside from UFO, it's been a while since Schenker has had inspiring musicians to work with (RIP Cozy). And, to an extent, that is the case here as well. The playing from the rhythm section is solid, but not amazing. New singer, Chris Logan puts in an above average performance, but lacks the charasma of a truly great lead vocalist (Gary Barden had character and Graham Bonnett was a veteran singer with class to spare). Ultimately, it's Schenker's great playing and interesting arrangements that make this disk a success!! Which is why we listen in the first place."
5,"Great shredding by Michael shenker on this CD, songs are well-written and a bit different than their previous material. Great!","Great shredding by Michael Schenker on this CD, the songs are well-written and a bit different than their previous material. Good vocals, a tight band, and great melodic lead guitar solos make this a must have for any guitar lover! Love it! Buy more UFO albums as well, it's all good!"
3,Nostalgy.....,"When listening to this 2001 CD by Michael ""Guitar God"" Schenker, one will find himself transported back to the eighties.... The album has a sound totally reminiscent of those times, mixing metal, hard and pop. Once again, Michael continues his bad choice of singers... (Gary Barden, the first, was the best!!). Now the guy is one Chris Logan, who has a kind of ""hair-metal band voice"". The music is great, but not so hard as Michael's first instrumental album, ADVENTURES OF THE IMAGINATION"". All in all, fans will not be dissapointed, but will have a crushing feeling of deja-vu..."
2,Ironic track 2 title sums up entire CD,"Michael Schenker Group? C'mon, who is this really? because it sure doen't sound like the Schenker who created songs like ""Desert Song"" ""On and On"" ""Lights Out"" ect.This CD is drivel."
2,"Michael good, Chris bad","This is a major setback to any of those (us) who like real guitar-driven rock, with a vocalist that has a decent range who can finish painting the picture over the 6-string canvas. This Logan fella' cannot do it, and the album pays the price. Schenker is awesome, but unfortunately, the 5-note singer brings the whole project down.Do not buy this CD if you like MSG's Perfect Timing, Save Yourself, and MSG. Robin McAuley's voice is sorely missed these days...."
2,The album is in accord with its cover art.....,"Unfortunately, Schenker missed the target here. Of course, his tone and the marvellous sounds he can take from his Gibson are still there, majestic, catchy, wonderful. But the songs, as a whole, are weak. It became clear that Michael's (as MSG) best work is now profoundly buried in the past...The songs could make an impression of being ""laid back"" (therefore the title of my review), but they are just weak.If you wanna hear Michael in top form, stick to his recent solo albums, ""ADVENTURES OF THE IMAGINATION"" and ""DREAMS AND EXPRESSIONS""."
3,Good,"The book has lots of ideas, some of the ideas seemed geared towards 2nd/3rd grade. I have adapted many of the books ideas to work for my 4th grade class."
5,Heavenly singing!,"YoungOk Shin has such a beautiful voice that can be compared to Kathleen Battle's. But, Shin's is more elegant. She's just perfect for these sacred songs. An album that I want to have it listen everyday. Gotta have this one."
1,"Buy the professional stuff instead, Gila is a waste of money","I installed professional tint from SunTek as a first time beginner and it went up well.I decided it's not that hard and wanted to save money, so I tried Gila's. What a nightmare! Gila's tint is thin and brittle, so it's very difficult to handle and when you get it installed it looks like the cheap tint that people have on an old car. Go for professional tint and ask Gila and Amazon to stop selling this junk."
1,Speech Improvement CD Set,"I have not tried the product yet but for $40 I was expecting a brand new professional CD set. This looks like nothing more than a ""homemade"" edition of the cassette version. The booklet looks like it was copied on a zerox machine and the labels on the CDs also look ""homemade."""
2,A painting turned into wallpaper,"This is wonderful music, virtually unrecorded apart from ""In Hydraulis"" itself (by the Clerks Group). Unfortunately slow tempi rob the music of its rhythmic interest, and it all comes out sounding like everything else Pomerium have ever done. There's a superficial gloss of ""renaissance"" all over it which is boring after 5 minutes. Processed, like American cheese."
4,Really good book!,"Mallory is having a horrible time at SMS,(not with the BSC), so she decides to go to boarding school. Before she leaves, she and Jessi both promise that they'll remain best friends. When she gets to Riverbend, she makes two new friends, but her roomate, Alexis, is horrible! For instance, like destroying a care paeckage that the BSC sent. P.S. The BSC and MAllory still keep in touch with Mallory often by E-mail. All in All , a good book."
4,A Sad Goodbye,"At first I was putting off reading this, because Mallory is one of my favorite characters. But when I finally did read it, I realized that it was the Best choice for Mallory. Mallory is having a horrible time at school, being teased and made fun of. She finds a boarding school in Massachusetts and decides to leave StoneyBrook. She meets some new, good friends, Sara and Smita but she also meets an awful, rude roomate Alexis. Alexis trashes Mallory's things and invades her privacy. I'm glad that Alexis finally gets what she deserves at the end of the story. It was sad to see Mallory go and I hope, that in future books the BSC won't totally forget about her."
2,It seems like this book is different.,Usally in the books the members always find solutions to their problems but Mallory moves away to bording school. I don't think that was the right way to solve her problems. You can't just run away from problems you have to face them. That's what parents try to teach kids but if kids are reading books that are contridicting their parents it is not going to work.
1,Why?,Ann Martin did the worst thing ever! I hated this story of Mallory leaving Stoneybrook and going to a boarding school.
4,Definitely a good sword for a great price.,"This product is a very good sword, finely crafted, with a custom scabbard. The blade is only 1 inch wide, and extends beyond 30 inches. The case handle and blade are sturdy, although the blade is a bit flimsy and not suited or recommended for actual combat purposes. It's small enough to make for a great decoration without taking up too much room."
3,"Useless, but helpful","Cosmic Test Tube covers everything from Erich von Daniken to Carl Sagan. Whether it's bees from Mars, Nazi flying saucers from the north pole, the grays, or secret military aircraft, Cosmic Test Tube has it all. Which might be too much, actually.It's helpful in that it can save you years of research. However, you won't be any closer to the ""truth"" after reading it."
2,Review of Encyclopedia,"This book is okay for learning about the types of challenges a teacher may encounter. However, as big as the book is, and as expensive as it is, it does not offer any substantive guidance on how a teacher should remedy the issues. The major formula used is track the students behavior and let the student know that you are tracking. To me, this is an obvious practice for any educator, but it is only part of the equation."
5,Fantastic Supplement,"This is a fantastic supplemental resource for behavior management. It is not a plug and play fix for behavior issues, but it provides a solid blueprint, with varying plans for each issue, for educators to shape to the individual student's needs. it is not going to do the work for the teacher, and results will vary and adaptations will have to be made. Just like any behavior plan in the real world. This is a great brainstorming tool for experienced teachers, as well as a must have for beginners."
5,This is great,"These are very good readings of the pieces by truly outstanding musicians. It is impossible not to enjoy them. If you own only one piano-duo recording, this should be it."
3,Great Hoops for the Price,"Super little SS hoops for the price. In fact you cannot beat it. I wear mine about 3/4 of the time. However, the hing is a bit weak, so I have had to buy three pairs. But the cost and quality over than the hing is great. I just get the same size over and use the left over spare hoop with the new one with no problem. All SS hoops have their weaknesses regardless of price. The metal is just tough to make a good hing with. I will buy another set again when I need to!!"
2,Not a definitive approach,"I am a great admirer of the music by the late Eduardo Mata and the Dallas Symphony. I have heard wonderful Prokofiev, Ibert and Stravinsky from this pairing.I cannot extend that admiration to this justifiably withdrawn production, however. To state it as simply as possible, the approach Maestro Mata adopted to the monumental ""Leningrad"" symphony is just too pretty. He tries to make beautiful music out of a score that represents the heroism of Russians under attack by both Hitler and Stalin.There is little reason for you to approach this CD unless you want to hear an inappropriate performance of this music. The Dallas players do their best but the direction is simply wrong."
4,Worth the purchase.,"There are a lot of really good, creative ideas in this book. The one thing I wish was added was just a quick statement at the begining of each activity that identifies what age group and what general problem the activity is most appropriate for. Such information allows me to decide, right away, whether to invest the time in reading further about the activity if I think it would be relavent to a particular child I am working with."
2,Unlikable Characters - Disappointing Mystery,"I wanted to like this book - after all, it's set in my very favorite city, Venice. About the best thing I can say about it is that the descriptions of Venice are evocative, and the author does a good job of having the main character - Cassandra - act as tour guide. On the negative side, I was disappointed in both the characters and the mystery. The characters are unlikable and unsympathetic - including Cassandra. She also does some very stupid things; if she's developing a reputation for solving mysteries, it must be pure dumb luck. The ending - when everything is all tied up neatly - felt rushed. Ignore the beautiful book cover, and avoid The Case of the Orphaned Bassoonists. If you want to read GOOD mysteries set in Venice, look for Donna Leon's novels. Each one is better than the last, and the very first one, ""Death at La Fenice,"" is 10 times better than this book."
4,Fun historic read,I am a bassoonist and I am also very interested in the orphanages this book centers its story around. I thought it was a fun read as well as informational. Enjoy!
4,Vegetable Mix vs Soup Greens,"I would give Soup Greens, which I can no longer seem to find, five stars. This Vegetable Mix is the closest to it that I could locate though, thus the four stars, but they are not quite as good."
4,"VEGATABEL MIX, PACKED IN LARGE JARS MARSHALLS CREEK","VEGETABLE MIX FRESHLY PACKED IN LARGE JARS, spices, herbs, seasoningsABSOLUTELY WORTH THE MONEY! ADD TO SOUPS, CASSEROLE, ANYTHING! I HAVE EVEY ADDED IT TO PASTA SALAD. SIMPLE REHYDRATE IN WATER, AND DRAIN, THEN USE.THIS COMES IN A LARGE CONTAINER, AND THE SHIPPING PRICE IS THE SAME FOR 1 OR 10 ITEMS, SO LOOK THROUGH THE LIST!"
2,TOO MANY ONIONS,"Bought one and really liked it. Purchased a second container and it was mostly onions. Not a very good blend. They were so strong that someone across a room could smell the onions.Great if you like onions, however if you want a veggie blend - BEWARE."
2,Spice Mix,"The item itself is fine, however the packaging itself is dishonest. I purchased this item and should of received 6 ounces, Instead I received a package that said 4 ounces. I have pictures to prove this. Check out the pictures above.... The thing I disliked MOST was the package was half full! Ok, do not advertise large size and compare it to a quart milk carton if you do not intend to fill the container, and this item could NOT of settled that much. Will NOT be purchasing this again, EVER!!!!NOT HAPPY!"
2,Disappointed and feeling a little deceived,"I have purchased this product previously. This time, there aretwo many onions in the mix, I didn't want minced onions, theyare easy to get. Also, the picture shows that the jar is almost asbig as a milk carton, which is true, however, the jars I got areabout 75% full, this is very disappointing. I will keep and usebut will not buy this particular brand again. When I buy driedvegetables I expect a lot more green, red and orange. The packagingand delivery were as usual for Amazon, great."
1,Bugs & Bees Votives,"They do help somewhat, but they only last 20 to 30 minutes. So you can imagine how many you would use in the matter of a few hours. Really not worth it."
1,HOLES TOO SMALL,I purchased these rubber earring backings specifically for usewith my Silpada Designs wire earrings. These rubber backingsare too small to fit on Silpada wire earrings.
2,"Both pieces get below par readings, despite very good sound and playing","Since this disc was included in a bargain box set from Dorian dedicated to the late Eduardo Mata, I thought I'd review it a disc at a time. This one, however, is negligible. both the Scythian Suite and Le sacre du printemps receive cautious, at times awkward readings. Mata, who died in a plane crash in 1995 at the age of 52, had brought prominence to the Dallas SO when it always ran second place to Houston. The playing is good here, but Mata doessn't stretch his musicians, and frankly, he seems rather blank as an interpreter. Being Mexican, he was characterized by reviewers as some kind of fiery Latin, but in reality his instincts were moderate - in this case, too moderate to successfully lead these two revolutionary works.The only real plus here is Dorian's excellent sound, an example of a boutique label outshining the major labels."
2,I got sponged,The two sponges I recieved were totally ad. One was much smller than the 5 to 6 inches and the others had holes in them so big I can hang them on my ears. Speed of delivery was ok but that's about it.
5,My personal favorite symphonic / melodic metal album,"I'll keep this short and sweet. I'm a big fan of bands such as Symphony X, Kamelot, Edguy, Freedom Call, Nightwish, and others of that style. Each of them is a fantastic band, but I once I heard Angra's new album, Rebirth, it became my favorite.The old Angra lineup wasn't really the best, but with the new band members and direction that they've taken, that's changed. Angra takes the symphonic metal style and gives it the polish and quality that it needs. I can only hope that they put out more music of this caliber soon. This album has no ""filler"" at all. Each song is wonderfully orchestrated and draws you in.It's definitely not background music."
5,UN TRISTE FINAL....PERO UN NUEVO GRAN COMIENZO....¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡,"REBIRTH ES EL 4TO. DISCO DE LOS BRASILEÑOS DE ANGRA (SIN CONTAR EP'S NI REGISTROS EN VIVO), AQUI PRESENTAN UNA NUEVA FORMACION, YA QUE PIEZAS FUNDAMENTALES HAN SIDO CAMBIADAS, QUEDARON AFUERA ANDRE MATOS (VOCES), R. CONFESSORI (BATERIA) Y LUIS MARIUTTI (BAJO), QUIENES FORMARON UNA NUEVA BANDA (SHAAMAN), UNA VERDADERA LASTIMA..¡¡ BUT LIFE GOES ON...EL GRUPO QUEDO CON LOS GUITARRITAS BITTENCOURT Y LOREIRO, QUINES RECLUTARON A EDU FALASCHI EN VOCES Y A 1 BATERISTA Y BAJISTA .REFORMADOS Y CON FUERZA TOTAL (COMO DICEN ELLOS MISMOS) VOLVIERON CON ESTE EXCELENTE CD REPLETO DE TEMAS MUY BIEN ELABORADOS, (COMO ES CONSTUMBRE DE ESTE GRUPO) MIS FAVORITOS SON NOVA ERA, REBIRTH, MILLEMIUN SUN Y ACID RAIN.MUY RECOMENDADO. COMPRALOwww.angra.net"
2,Boring Rebirth,"This album can't hold a candle to all previous Angra albums: Angels Cry, Holy Land (their masterpiece) and even Fireworks.Even if they got rid of that annoying screaming singer by the name Andre Matos, that was not enough to save this album. Angra gave up the idea of being original and went for a generic ""melodic-European-power metal"", aping acts like Rhapsody and Stratovarius. The result was a disgrace. The drumming is annoying, double kick all the way. The new singer has a good voice, but all he do is be a metal screamer with no personal touch in his tone.I just hated this album, to the point that I gave it for free to a friend of mine."
4,Another Great APC Product,"This is my third APC unit. My previous two units are still running, with new batteries, without problems. I think having a UPS/power conditioner on my computers is the main reason I haven't had a hardware based computer failure since the early 90's. I use my machine 10-12 hours per day."
5,UPS with an attitude,"It really doesn't have an attitude, it just is what it is. It works, its quiet, it has cool software. Within days of installing it, we had several power line glitches during computer operation, everthing else in the house was bonked but not the computer. What else can you say, it worked!"
5,These are great,Took my daughter only a day to learn how to walk on these. She loves them! Would recommend to all.
2,Questionable Design,"This case is a far cry from what I had expected. Based on the description on Amazon and on the manufacturer's website, I thought this case was going to be top notch. I was disappointed, to say the least. The case looks fine (thus the two stars), but it is almost impossible to type a message with the Blackberry in the case because the cover is so stiff. Maybe it will soften up in time, but until then, you will have to take your device out of the case to use the keyboard. Additionally, the case muffled the ring tone to a degree that it was almost impossible to hear the device even at the highest ringer volume. The swivel clip is also not up to expectations. It's cheaply designed and swings freely while on your belt. I expected a notched swivel that would allow for a fixed position, much like those found on the majority of cell phone cases today.Back to the hunt for an efficiently designed and functional Blackberry case."
1,Don't waste your money,"I made the mistake of ignoring the first review and purchasing this item anyway because of the price. Even at 2.49 plus shipping, save your money. I had to cut the antenna opening to get the case to ""almost"" fit correctly. I am terribly disappointed in the fit of this product but would lose more trying to return the item than just to live with it.Keep your money!!"
3,No Comment,"I know every track of this CD played by several other violinists and this CD will not stay in my memory. The sound is smooth and without emotion. From a recent recording I expect rather a good sound quality than a memorable interpretation. I know Dorian by reputation only but for this CD the recording is under the average.For those who give 5 stars to this CD. Let me suggest you Andre Rieu. For those who know of Heifetz, forget this one."
4,Works great,We bought this battery pack for the G Scale Lionel Train we got my Grandson for Christmas. Works great. He had lot's of fun with the train.
5,"Great Guys, With Great Music","Wow! The first ""real"" Christian emo band. I mean, there are others out there, but these guys are real in their faith. Music is so moving, and easy to get into. The Live show can't be touched! If you get a chance to see these guys, do it. Even if you don't like the cd, see them live. Totally different experience!"
3,Works when it stays together,"I have two of the BD-10 units and have used them for a little over a year now. They are OK but the design is lacking. First, the connection for attachments (i.e., hammer probe) should be somewhere other than right next to the prongs. The prongs make it difficult to screw and unscrew the attachment to the unit. Second, the nut holding the prongs has backed itself out twice. Repairing it requires a minimum of an hour and unbelievable patience. I have just contacted Delmhorst customer service requesting a replacement unit but have not heard back yet. I'm very curious to see if they stand behind their products. Note, I have only had this issue with one of my units. The other one has been issue-free."
4,The best available Semiramide,"Yes, this is not the legendary Semiramide with Sutherland and Horne. But it is also very good. There is no doubt that Sutherland is THE Semiramide. Nobody ever comes close. She was just spectacular as this Babylonian queen. Her voice and technique was at her peak in this recording. Sinclaire had a right voice for Arsace and was very involved but lacked the solid technique for Rossini's singing. Other supporting casts were good. Bonynge did a superb job at conducting. The sound quality is fine for the live recording. With the very budget price, I recommend this recording over the extremely expensive DG album with Struder and Lamore which suffer mostly from the unimaginative conducting by Marin. I wish Decca will re-reissue the Sutherland/Horne recording soon. That one is THE Semiramime to die for."
3,Sutherland is excellent - The rest are quite poor,"Sinclair is by far the worst Arsace on any of my four different full length versions. Horne is always the best although Larmore is also wonderful. When this recording was made there were essentially no men who could sing the music. More recent recordings with Frank Lopardo, Stanford Olsen and Gregory Kunde as Idreno are much to be preferred. Ramey is the best Assur on records, although Pertusi is also very good.The best CD is the Studer, Larmore, Olsen and Ramey recording. Studer is very spirited and accurate but lacks the tonal warmth of Sutherland. Buy the Studer CD first get this one as a supplement."
1,Deplorable!,"This is the worst opera recording I have ever heard. It reminds me of the old ""bootleg"" albums made in the 60's and 70's on low-quality recording equipment smuggled into venues where it was illegally recorded. There is distortion whenever one of the featured sopranos--especially Sutherland--enters the high register, and the hissing background sound that persists throughout the recording is utterly distracting. I will be donating this recording to my local used bookstore . . . or perhaps I will throw it away so some other unsuspecting customer doesn't pay good money for it."
1,Semiramide John Sutherland and Monica Sinclair,"Make no mistake (as I did when I ordered this CD set): this is a review of the OPERA D'ORO live recording of Semiramide in Rome in 1968, it is NOT a review of the just-rereleased Sutherland/Horne/Bonynge version on POLYGRAM.I quit listening after the first 4 or 5 tracks because it was so poorly recorded and mis-cast. What more can I say?"
1,THE ABOVE REVIEWS REFER TO A DIFFERENT RECORDING,"Please be aware that both the above reviews refer to a studio recording featuring Sutherland and Horne with the LSO, and NOT the recording on sale here which has Monica Sinclair as Arsace and a different orchestra."
2,Sutherland is nothing when compared to Sills,"Sutherland may have the coloratura technique to deal with bel canto arias, but she cannot sing Baroque arias accurately like Sills can. Sutherland's arias in ""Semiramide"" are nothing compared to the bravura arias that Sills sings in ""Giulio Cesare"". If Sutherland were to sing those arias using Sills' extremely difficult embellishments, she would choke! Sills' coloratura technique sees her through all kinds of coloratura arias, whether Baroque, bel canto, Mozartian, or Straussian.By the way, Baroque coloratura is more difficult than bel canto coloratura due to its even more complicated fioratura."
2,Not sure why all the glowing reviews,I just don't get all the glowing reviews. This is very pedestrian. The lyrics aren't deep; the grooves aren't interesting.There's nothing to this record really.
4,First heard in a club,"Anyone know where I can find the ""Big Red"" remix of ""Idol""?? I heard it here in a Chicago club a few weeks back but I can't locate it anywhere. The album version is great too, but I really want to own both. Thanks :-)"
5,This CD haunts you....,Finding Amanda Ghosts CD was a great find! I don't think their is one song on this CD that I dislike.This CD still is in rotation and I bought it long ago when it first came out. Her style is very different and I know some may hate this CD but I am not one of them! I love it! I wish she would have continued her career! My favorite songs are Idol and Glory Girl. They are upbeat and the lyrics are good. I encourage you to buy this CD if you like Jewel or Dido or any of those type of artist as that is as close as you can come to Amanda -she really has her own sound! My advise check out the clips and if you still want more this CD is for you!
5,One of the BEST CDs of the year,"If you buy one CD this year, I PROMISE you it should be Amanda Ghost's Ghost Stories. I took a chance, never hearing any of her music, a Virgin Records employee highly recommended it and I now feel like writing him a thank you letter for the recomendation. Her songs are the perfect blend of electronic, rock, dance, pop and even country. If you like Portishead, Stevie Nicks, and -- oh forget it, she's Amanda Ghost and I guarantee she will be huge. The only draw back of this whole CD is the artwork. I wish there were some actual photos of her besides the crappy image manipulated cover. Oh well..."
4,Ghost Stories,"Wow, I just got this CD for easter and I love it! For those who like Jewel, Sara McClaughlin, and Enya-tpes, this album has some great songs. Enjoy!"
3,Ghost's songs are hauntingly edgy (Three & a half stars),"Although more street-glitzy than her across-the-Atlantic counterparts like Sheryl Crow, Aimee Mann, Paula Cole, or Alanis Morrissette, the UK's Amanda Ghost is just as much of a wordsmith and very handy with a musical hook. Her sound can be most likened with that of Shirley Manson's band, ""Garbage"" and that's a seriously cool sound indeed.****""Ghost Stories"" best tracks kick off the album beginning with the dance-infused ""Filthy Mind"" and the anthem-ish ""Idol."" Initially, you're expecting the tough girl attitude to drive the music, but listen more carefully and you'll pick up on the artful and wounded undercurrents."
4,brittany spears on acid,I have never heard of Amanda Ghost but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I like her album. I would recommend it if you are tired of listening to the same old stuff. She has a nice upbeat sound and is easy to listen to. Her lyrics are not predictable and very enjoyable.
5,body aplenty,"My hair is mid-back long and color treated for YEARS. I always get compliments on my hair from people I know as well as complete strangers. Have tried other top-named products, but keep going back to Big Sexy Hair. It goes directly where I want it and absorbs quickly. I let it dry naturally as well as blow dry (most often). It works either way...no heavy, dragged down flat look;)"
4,Lift,"Lifts my roots up!! Without making them greasy or stiff. It gives me more volume. Use it correctly though and blow dry hair right after to blow the roots up, this holds them"
2,Not worth the $,"It's an okay product and does pretty much what it says it will... it gives your hair decent volume, but leaves it kind of sticky and wet looking. Make sure you blow dry very well after using it. Probably won't buy it again."
1,disappointing,"after reading reviews seeing my roommates all using this product i gave it a try. the first day--nothing! the second day my hair was so stiff i couldn't brush through it. i had to wash my hair immediately before leaving for work. not only that i had to use a lot of conditioner which then made my hair very very limp. i have never ever returned a product before but this will be going back tomorrowi have thin, straight hair."
4,You'll have fun...,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Melinda was a great character, and so were all the others. I could see so much of myself and others in her. A very believable read. Living in the area the author was writing about, I can tell you she has captured Main Street perfectly. This book had me smilling and thinking and smiling again. It is worth the read. Check it out, you won't be sorry. You'll have fun, see yourself, see your friends, understand a little more about human nature."
4,Contemporary novel of manners,"I've read all of Lipman's novels, and have thoroughly enjoyed them. If you think about it, there's not really much that you can object to -- the flaky characters are likable, the plot is helped along by various humorous/embarassing/poignant incidents, and the writing is quite good. Lipman's books are well-packaged reflections of real life, suitable for a bit of entertainment and escapism. After all, it's much more fun to read about the dating woes of someone else than to dwell on your own. The Way Men Act falls into this category as well. It's a fun book, full of quick-paced dialogue, interesting characters, and humorous observations."
2,Light but bitter,"I'm half way through this book. I don't think I can finish it. I feel like I'm reading a ""Teen Valley High"". (If there is such a thing. If not there should be).I don't care about the characters. I have no sympathy for the lead character. There is this bitter, whinging tone underneath all the lightness. Nothing seems to be happening. I think there is meant to be suspense about who gets the guy, but I don't care. I hope neither female lead does. I'm not sure I can finish it to find out."
2,More Work Needs to Be Done,You learn something from this book. But I found it needs more work to be done. I'm not sure if the book was rushed or not. It might help if there were current similar chemistry problems preparing the individual for the GRE Chemistry Test. But you still learn something from this book.
4,Loosely based on real character,"The Hitch-hiker movie is loosely based on the William ""Billy"" Cook killing spree in 1951. Billy Cook wore a leather jacket and had a drooping right eye same as William Talman's charater. Cook murdered six people including the Mosser family shooting the husband and wife and their three chil dren. Dumping their bodies in a mine shaft outside Joplin Missouri, even shot the family dog. Billy Cook was finally apprehended and was executed in the San Quenten Gas Chamber in 1952. William Talman puts in an excellent characterization. ."
3,The Hitch-Hiker,"The story itself is outstanding. However, the movie is almost unwatchable because it is very dark and full of ""scratches."" I wished they would have cleaned it up to make it more pleasing to watch."
1,Lousy quality,"This is advertised as ""Re-mastered"" A2ZCDS should be ashamed. The CD is like a poor home recorded copy from a local TV station. Poor resolution, bad quality picture.There are better copies of this famous film Noir out there. This is not one of the good ones."
4,GRUELLING,"This is one of the most gruelling thrillers I've ever watched, it's 70 minutes of two people being psychologically tortured by a psychopath. Talman and O'Brien give excellent performances but the real shock, considering how many films I've seen him in, is Lovejoy. He gives an amazingly emotional performance that's painful to watch.This film has been beautifully restored by the Roan group and is cheap at the price."
5,Swimming with the tides of change,"There is a great deal of advice about handling change in the workplace. What I especially liked about this book is how the ideas are broken into bite-sized, digestible chunks. The writing is down-to-earth, practical, helpful; the tone is one of friendly exhortation. This is a no-nonsense tactical manual for anyone leading (or simply experiencing) organizational change. Encouraging us to see change as opportunity rather than something to dread, it helps keep the reader buoyant with the tides of change."
5,For Any Modern Manager,Michael Maginn has found a way to break management down to its essential features while focusing specifically on the types of change with which most companies must deal. Very informative and applicable.
3,Enjoyable - but,"Tom Bodett CD Free Fall of Webster Cummings - enjoyed the story very much until we got to chapter 28 and on. We evidently have a defective CD as it continues to skip and repeat the chapter over again. As our return/exchange period has passed, guess we will never get to the ""rest of the story"". If ordering, be sure to check your purchase promptly - we learned the hard way."
2,A Waste of Time,"The 2nd chapter in which Webster is sucked from an airplane and free-falls 4000 feet is the funniest thing I've read in a long time. BUT IT'S DOWNHILL FROM THERE.I was disappointed with the NEGATIVE STEREOTYPE of the ""judgmental, inflexible Christian."" A father throws a Bible at his teen-aged son for getting a girl pregnant, then never speaks to him again.This story lines are TOO FAR-FETCHED TO BE PLAUSIBLE.THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT WAS THE ENDING... or LACK of ending. The book is written so that readers will expect all of the many loose ends to eventually be tied up, but only a few are tied, and not how the reader is lead to believe. Some story lines are left hanging with no end in sight, so their inclusion in the book seems to be only as ""filler."" Some necessary explanations are never given.I wasted my time with this book."
5,Laughed 'till I cried,The rest of the family made me leave the room during the last hour I read this book because my laughing was disturbing to them. What a great story!
1,worst media I have ever used,"I had some important live recordings badly damaged because I used these pretty colored discs. Of the five pack I bought, four had long skips and one ceased to record after twenty minutes. these have a plastic slider instead of a metal one, to protect the disc. I think this may be the reason for the failures but I'm really not sure. I just know I wouldn't use them again."
1,They just doubled in pricre,I purchased these from here a few months ago and got 20 for this price. What happened?
5,"fabulous, totally compelling, and couldn't put it down",I really loved the book and it was very interesting and I love the author
4,works great with sonic tooth brush,I love the great job this does with my sonic toothbrush. I do wish I could find it in local stores.It is easy to use and last a long time. Has a great taste that refreshes.
5,Crest Intelliclean toothpaste,"I love this toothpaste and the toothbrush you had to buy to use it, however it is a shame crest is no longer making it so after this purchase I will no longer have any toothpaste to use it properly. Crest I am disappointed in you selling a product over 100.00 and then taking the toothpaste off the market!!!"
5,No Mess No Fuss,No sink mess. No tooth paste tube leaking. No looking for the tooth paste. No mess anywhere. ++++ My Dentist check ups have been better since I have been using the system. Most likely because it is less bother to brush my teeth.
4,it what it says it is,"too bad you can't get replacement brushheads for this unit. well you CAN, but you'd be nuts to buy it from Amazon. I hope they end up with a warehouse full of them."
5,Something Hilarious This Way Comes,"This is not your momma's old bite em and run vampire tale. This is by far, the most innovative vampire novel I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Generation X have a new hero and his name is Dunkin. This Motley Crue of vampire slayers will have you laughing until it hurts. Add to cart today you won't be disappointed. Hey! Don't take my word just read an excerpt for yourself."
5,Crazier than Mad Magazine!,"Crites is a HOOT! I haven't had this much fun in decades! I don't know where he keeps his brain when he isn't writing, but it's scary to think of it running loose somewhere! Dunkin the Vampire Slayer has something for everyone, no matter how mad you might be! It has non-stop action, hysterically absurd humor, and the oddest collection of characters you could ever imagine. Buy two! You won't want to let your copy get away from you!"
4,Gavin Froome - Post + Beam,"Post + Beam is another album of smooth and juicy tech-house from the Canadian Gavin Froome. ""Shade"" once again displays his more downtempo side, but ""Assateague"" and ""Machineage"" are more representative of Froome's musical sensibilities: steady beats, gentle melodies. Indeed, this album seems much more subdued than Mobile Villager, his previous album. ""JC-120"" slides by like water off a duck's back, and ""Piece"" ends the album on a mellow tip. Quite a nice journey."
3,it's ok,"The second half this disc is better than the first half. I found the first half fell into that cliched jazz/house sound which felt a bit contrived to me. However, the second half flows and moves really well. It a good disc with some cool tracks but it is one of those discs that you have to decide if it's really worth it to hang on to for the few good tracks or should you scrap it for something else. I think I may scrap mine."
4,Versatile case,"Great case! Instead of the velcro attachments that certain aftermarket brands (e.g. Targus) use, this case uses a hard shield -- similar to the PDA screen cover that it comes with -- to hold the Visor in place. I can attach the PDA face down or up. I place it face down, when I'm traveling, and for normal, easy access, it's face up.The pen holder will not hold a Dr. Grip pen or any other thick-based comfort grip pen.Other than that one criticism, I've been very happy with my case. It conveniently holds a few business cards and I have a pen and paper ready to jot down something (e.g. driving directions)."
2,Is not enough !!,"This book is not enough. I pass the exam 9E0-121 but a with a low score. I got questions no documented even in the cisco exam description. Questions about Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), The protocol used by the CRL Servers (LDAP/HTTP), Bandwidth Management (new in release 3.6.1), Diffie-Hellman Group 5 (DH5) (new in release 3.6.1), and more."
2,...not enough to pass exam,"I read this book cover to cover 4 times, and thought I had the exam in the bag. However, there were many questions and concepts presented on the 642-511 exam, that are not even mentioned in this study guide. One would think getting Cisco certified materials, would ensure the proper tools to achieve positive results... decent information in the book, but the practice CD is full of errors and inconsistancies that conflict with the books content. Don't count on this book to pass the exam....."
1,Too Many Errors,"I would have expected more coming from Cisco Press. This book is riddled with errors. What's worse yet is that the Boson practice test uses this book for reference; thereby making the Boson error prone as well. This practice software is bad too. I am very very disappointed with this material. I could have done a better job myself. If you are studying for the CCSP PIX exam, you're better off just using the material on Cisco's website. You can find everything you need there. Good luck!!"
2,"Good for students, but....","The previous editions of this book contained a lot of reference information and illustrations for both novice and experienced home carpenter. This edition has changed the emphasis to students primarily, with larger type but less specific reference material such as hanging doors, special framing problems, etc. Disappointing."
5,"Good info, and to the point.",Covers a wide range of building information. Straight to the point with each subject covered. Makes a good reference book for the do-it-yourselfer (which is why I have a copy). A good section on engineered wood products -- very informative.
3,Nice meter,"The quality of this meter is very good and the controls and display are easy to understand.This meter cannot measure DC resistance. Extech technical support advised me to get their LCR200, which does measure DCR, though it's not obvious from the description on Amazon or their own web site. It does spell it out in the user's manual, which is available for download on the Extech web site."
3,"Love it, but it broke!",I bought this case several months ago and I am ordering it again because the bottom plastic pieces that hold the Edge into the case broke off. I love the case--even though it is not very sturdy.
4,Nice Selection With a Country Flavor,"A mix of oldies (Brenda Lee, Burl Ives) and current stars (Lee Ann Womack, Mark Chesnutt) converge for a well-rounded collection of Christmas tunes.My favorites on this compilation include:* George Strait's old fashioned country sound on the title track*Mark Chesnutt's warm voice on Light of the World*Tracy Byrd's very upbeat version of Jingle Bell*** Lee Ann Womack's superb treatment of The Nativity. Her clear tones really told the story well.* The Mavericks gave an Elvis treatment to Santa Claus Is Back In Town** Yearwood & Gill's duet on An Angel Gets Its Wings* Bobby Helms' upbeat handling of Jingle Bells Rock* Burl Ives' robust singing on A Holly Jolly Christmas* Brenda Lee's great sound on Rockin' Around the Christmas TreeThe other six tunes were acceptable, though I would have skipped George Jones' plaintive, hokey sounding Silent Night."
5,This was great,"My friend, Arianna had this video in grade 4/5/6 and probly still has it(thats off the topic) well she brought it to school one day for the class to watch, and all i can say is it is great, it shows how horses evovled, how mating between donkey and zebras and horses make weird animals. It is for the mature student and adult who doesn't make faces when they are talking about private parts and mating."
1,Sound quality is terrible,"The sound quality on this CD makes it unacceptable. It was recorded live, and is extremely scratchy and one can barely make out the vocals. It's impossible to know whether the performance was good or not, since the recording is so poor."
1,lots of discussion with little practical information,"This book is a tour of Ginseng interviews with people who deal with, grow and have had some interest in the plant. It gives very little practicle hands on information for growing Ginseng."
2,"not worth it, but necessary","The book itself is not much. It has a brief introduction, a big glossary of terms, and a few exercises at the end. I bought it not out of desire, but necessity since it's required for a college course I'm taking. I paid a lot less than the publisher's list price from an Amazon seller and a lot less than the college bookstore price. The color information is all in black and white -- go figure. All in all I'm satisfied with the price, but again, the book is pretty sparse in terms of information -- unless you like reading definitions."
4,Strange and Wonderful,"This neglected master presents a rare challenge and delight for the avid reader. He was an illusive stylist whose prose poems evoke conceptual phantasies of true brilliance and complexity. This brief collection is a testament to the diverse gifts of Michaux-strange and obscure as they were. A painterly voice, without question. Complete with French."
5,Driving the Old Mother Road,"I got this book before going on a trip down 66, along with a few others. I loved it. I had a lot of the people I met along the way sign the book and once in a while, got some of the owners of restaurants, gas stations, roadside attractions, and diners featured in the book to sign it. What a wonderful scrapbook to have of one of the last great American road trips!"
2,No map; no direction,"This is a book about a road -- but there's no roadmap! The author chose to structure the book's five chapters around such things as tourist traps, filling stations, places to eat, motor hotels, and ""memories"". While, of course, these are interesting things along a road, the salient characteristic of a road is that it goes from one place to another. What are those places? What sequence of states/towns/views do you encounter as you travel this road? This book provides no geographical context for its pictures and disjointed text about the Mother Road.A road also has a temporal dimension. This book fails to provide a sense of how this great road has changed over time. Although there are pictures from various dates, there is no organization, and old photos are indiscriminantly intermixed with new ones.It is interesting to thumb through the book, but the Route 66 Remembered is only a random collection of scenes with no direction."
1,Not a high quality product,"Within the first 2 weeks after I got this fan, it developed this annoying rattling sound, which made it unusable to me. For as much as this fan costs, it is not constructed out of high quality materials. As mentioned in the other reviews, the LEDs are really bright and will bother you if you are sensitive to light while you are trying to sleep. My other major compliant is the remote control. You have to point the remote directly at the little receiver on the fan for it to pick up the signal. I ended up have to push the buttons on the remote about 10 times before the fan responds. If this fan is in your price range, I would recommend looking for a higher quality fan. My fan is going back to the store!"
4,quickbreeze,"This is pretty good, I have used oral irrigation products for years and am convinced one cannot properly clean out the debris that gets in between your teeth thoroughly without one. This product is a great way to do it without a machine. Temperature control is difficult if you have separate hot and cold controls but not impossible to overcome. It is a good alternative to water pik like devices, other than for travel where you would not have the faucet fitting in place."
4,My thoughts on Showerbreeze,The Showerbreeze is as advertised and was delivered on time. I'm still learning the best way to use it.Controlling the temperature and pressure. It's handy to do this in the shower..I think the is a good tool and purchase.
5,Excellent product,"I absolutely love this thing. I have a receding gumline, and the dentist said the only thing I could do is try to prevent it from getting any worse by using a water pick. I had tried one that hooked up to the sink in the past, and I hated it, because it was so messy. When I saw this, I figured it was worth giving it a try. It works wonderfully, and I can tell a big difference in the health of my gums and teeth. They don't hurt as often, and they even feel cleaner, and I feel like I am doing what the dentist told me to do (for once)."
4,ShowerPik Feels Great !!,"I Added the ShowerPik to our shower head and everyone in the family uses it daily . Even the seven year old loves it. There is no mess because it's in the shower, thus no major clean-up. Makes my teeth feel clean even before I brush."
2,Great Idea - disappointing product,I bought this after reading negative reviews of Waterpik products. I had used the Waterpick for years and liked it but it finally broke. The company shipped the product quickly and everything was very good quality. The problem is it just doesn't work. It is more like holding a water hose to your mouth. The water stream is not fine and directed enough to really remove particles and plaque. The oscillation feature of the Waterpick cleans much more quickly and deeply. I sent it back after trying it and nearly drowning a few times. I rate the company highly as they were very helpful about returning it and getting my money back. Maybe they can improve the design so it really does what it is supposed to do.
5,Wish I bought one years ago,Best thing to ever happen to my gums. I bought the Oral Breeze faucet version and liked it so much I got this shower version. I prefer the shower version as I don't get inadvertent water spray. This is a great product!
2,hose,"The hose is about a foot or two to short for my shower and it is difficult to use. I am only 5'2"". No one ever takes short people into account. My sister who is 5 foot would never be able to use product this in my shower. My shower head is higher than most other showers, don't know why."
4,Oral Breeze versus Water Pick,"I have used the 'Water Pick' dental cleaning tool brand for many years. When I saw the 'Oral Breeze' Dental tool sold by Amazon, I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. It operates just as I expected and I am quite happy with this product. (It is certainly less noisy then my Water Pick.)Howwever, I would like to have a button on it that could momentarily interupt the water stream and thus allow for a controlled pulse. This I believe would allow for for a better cleaning tool."
5,"Just a great,simple product that does what it should!",This is SO much more pleasant to use than the counter top products. I just hang my toothbrush in the shower now and totally avoid all the splashing and mess on my counter and mirrors. I guess there is other similar brands out there but this particular company really shines. They have real customer service and will actually reply to your emails.
1,did not like at all,"Have had nothing but problems with our new oral breeze. Will never buy another. Biggest complaint is with the very inflexible hose. It is very difficult to rotate while cleaning teeth. Also, the valve is very touchy and it is difficult to adjust to get the proper setting. Altogether, a very negative experience."
1,robs shower pressure,The valve assembly restricts the flow of water to the shower head even when it is fully open to the shower and closed to the water pik. I am returning this and purchasing another that appears to allow for better shower head water flow.
1,$500 plumbing repair,"Worst experience ever with a consumer product. After I installed the red oral breeze, the fitting was not tight, and when turned on it sprayed water on me, and it somehow caused water to leak into my kitchen cabinet. When I tried to take off the oral breeze faucet tip to replace with the old faucet tip, it was stuck and I had to use a vicegrip. I could not get it out without taking the inner tip (which should not come out) and riping the tube that connects the faucet tip to the cold water pipe. In short, it resulted in a $500 plumbing repair and I still couldn't use the !@#%*^#@! thing.."
3,"Great product, but use it carefully - Updated review","I've never used a standard countertop oral irrigator, so I can't compare, but the ShowerBreeze gives you great freedom to move the nozzle around without worrying about the water flying everywhere. The pressure can be quite strong--I think I have at times irrigated too aggressively with this thing without realizing because it feels good. My only other complaint is that the whole hose thing is unsightly in the shower.UPDATE: I loved this product at first (originally 5 stars), but the lever that switches the water flow from the shower head to the irrigator hose wore out after about 18 months of daily use because it is made of material that seems too weak for this purpose. Major design flaw. I have since switched to a competing product that integrates the switch into the handpiece. It is cheaper, easier to use and seems like it will last indefinitely."
5,Just what I was looking for!,"Very pleased with my purchase.Received order quickly.Is very well constructed.It is exactly what I needed,and wish I had bought it sooner.Would purchase again, and will recommend to others."
4,very convenient,The shower breeze that i ordered is not complicated to install and its very easy to use. The price is very reasonable compare to other products.
4,Works great!,"I love the convenience of using this in the shower. I just wish they had a tip for periodontal work. My one complaint would be that the switch is by the showerhead. If you are short, it may be hard to reach. I'd like to see them move the switch to the handle. A minor quibble is that it looks horrendous on the shower. I just wrap mine around the shower head."
5,Wish they had 30 years ago,Great product. No mess. Easy to use. Easy to install. Should be standard equipment in every bathroom. Ran out of things to say.
4,Does a decent job.,"I think it's very convenient to brush in the shower and this water flossing helps too.The water ""jet"" wasn't as narrow as I expected (like an electric water flosser) but it still does a good job cleaning gum-to-tooth contact areas and has greatly reduced my gingivitis. It's still a good idea to string floss from time to time to get rid of gunk from tooth-to-tooth contact."
5,Simple Device that Works GREAT!,"My dentist suggested this and after a little research, I decided on the Shower Breeze Model. It is easy to install, and easy to use. And since I am using it in the shower, no worries about making a mess! This thing WORKS! No tools needed to install it, either! When you first start using it, go easy on the water pressure, as it will cause a ""tickling"" sensation on your gums. After several uses, your gums will get used to it. Since it is ready to use in my shower, I have been using it daily, and I can honestly say, my teeth and gums feel and look more healthy than ever. I can't wait to hear what my dentist says on my next visit! Get this...you won't be disappointed!"
5,A waterpik that actually works!,I love this. This is my 2nd one of these. I moved and didn't take the time to remove it but thats ok because this time around the shower hook up part seems sturdier and is metal. Can make whatever water pressure you need with this. Makes your mouth feel super clean!
2,No Shower pressure,"No Shower pressure but the product works as advertised. BUTTT, loosing shower pressure to gain another advantage... I am not sure if that is good. The product needs to provide a valve that does not inhibit, in any way, the water path. In other words, the diameter of the pipe remains the same, and then you have a good product."
4,Beats the Water Pik,"This is an Oral Breeze ""oral irrigator."" It is not the plug-in Water Pik brand. The Oral Breeze is far better than the Water Pik because it attaches to your shower head. As such, it provides as much pressure as you like (more than the plug-in type) and it won't leak all over your sink like the Water Pik plug-in. My only criticism is that sometimes the hose is hard to maneuver in the shower so you must turn your head to use it properly rather than just maneuvering the pik. This beats flossing. All in, highly recommended."
4,beats flossing,"I have permanent retainers upper and lower on my teeth.. flossing is a pain in the... yea you get the idea. The table top versions of this are all wimps, no pressure,messy..I wanted something that I could control the pressure and something that didn't require I remodel my bathroom to accommodate. This did the trick, although I still floss this makes the area with the permanent retainers a lot easier to take care of.. and it is no mess...although it does require you shower occasionally."
2,Hard to use,"Not too hard to install, but did reduce water pressure slightly to the shower head. I found it awkward to move hose around to direct at teeth. Have to adjust pressure often to get what you want for various teeth. Decided it was too much trouble and returned it."
5,Great product,"Like many others, I used a water pik sparingly because it was cumbersome and required effort to set it up. Then, along came shower breeze and the drawbacks were eliminated. My wife and I use it every day and love it. It is so simple and efficient. In fact, we bought a second one to install in our summer home. We are sold on it."
2,"Works okay, but could be much better and cheaper","The advantage of this product is it hooks right up to your shower and has great water pressure, but I find the water stream to be too big. In other words, the opening is too large; it's like sticking a small hose in your mouth. If the opening was a little smaller and more concentrated I think it would be more effective, better utilize the water pressure, and definitely be more comfortable. Also, while it doesn't leak and the quality seems good, aside for the tips that sell separately for $4.95 it's just a rubber hose and inexpensive water valve one could buy at the hardware store. Also, the description says no tools required, but you will need a wrench and some thread seal tape if you don't want it to leak. In the photo it looks like the unit was installed with thread seal tape, which is not included."
4,"A little clumbersome, but it works","I bought this instead of a hand-held water pic. I use it every time I shower, can adjust it to change the water pressure, and typically turn it down to prevent beating my gums up. It is a little awkward to use, but works for me."
2,hard to hook up,I had so much trouble trying to hook this up that I put it in a drawer and forgot about it
5,It's a power-washer for your teeth,"Most people think it would be great to buy a water pik. What they don't take into account is how messy it is. Water gets everywhere. You have to refill it all the time. It gets dirty. It needs to be plugged in. The unit can fail due to mechanical problems. And most of all, the output is pretty weak. This wonderful product has none of these downsides. You'll want to use this every day because it's so convenient."
5,Best Oral care Product since the Massed Produced Toothbrush,"I first fell in love with the major brand name plug in type device. After experiencing the short comings of the plug in type and doing the research, I purchased one of Showerbreeze units. I never used the other one again. For less than thirty bucks it's an extremely cheap investment in good dental hygiene. IMO This is the easiest most effective way to keep my teeth clean at and below the gum lines. If you have a family member or friend with bad breath give them one of these. There just no excuse to allow the bacterial ""soup"" to accumulate in ones mouth."
4,works well,this product works well and is easy to use. very convienent and helps me remember to floss more! just need to be careful on the pressure you use!
1,Reduces shower flow by 50%,"You must go to the hardware store and buy a ""T."" Install this inline in the water flow before the shower head. Place the dental product at the down side of the ""T."" Then you will maintain your shower water flow. Otherwise it will be reduced 50%."
4,Chinese Horse Pewer Pendant Necklace,"Nice pendant, nice leather holder. Fast delivery, safely packaged. Glad i ordered it. Dan's Jewelry did a very nice job."
5,More than I expected,This Pewter symbol necklace on a black cord was even better in person than in the picture. The cord is adjustable so it goes with many outfits. I've received many compliments on the jewelry. Would definately purchase another item from this vendor. Arrived within stated time as well.
4,TAAM works for me,"As someone who knows how to use Authoware but has trouble getting started I found the book to be quite useful. Mr Henry relates his life experiences in a way that connects with the average ""Joe"". He has made learning a sometimes difficult program fun. Mr. Henry advises you on key items that need to be kept in mind during the development process and applies his teaching through interactive lessons in the middle and at the end of almost every chapter. He also provides little mental checklists for the more complicated steps. As a novice user I find Mr. Henry's book to be invaluable. I look forward to his teachings in the upcoming advanced book."
1,Not worth the money. And I got it for free.,"I received this book as ""The Manual"" for Mr. Henry's Authorware class. Neither were worth the money. Like the class, the book is horribly disorganized and filled with too many of Mr. Henry's personal notes, not to mention the gross grammatical and spelling errors. The content leaves much to be desired. As a beginner, I had too many questions that this book left unanswered. This book is touted as ""reference for problem solutions."" So far, this book has not helped solve any problems that I've encountered either as a beginner or a novice. It hasn't even pointed me in the right direction. Mr. Henry provides just enough information to thoroughly confuse the beginner, and doesn't provide the how's & why's of what he's trying to explain. For the price, there are many other books available that are better organized and professionally put together. And will help solve your Authorware problems a lot quicker, with a lot less frustration."
2,gore filled home movie,"As far as this being a film,it's not. It's basicly some friends that got together and decided to make a movie. No real profesional actors but some are probably pro strippers. The movie does have some great special effects and make up and even seems to be story boarded out well it's kinda boring and I just don't like movie's shot on video. If your a total gore head you'll dig it."
1,crap..,"This movie has no redeeming qualities. Just looks like a group of goths got together and just made a backyard film because ooo ""vampires are cool"", no plot to speak of. I had hoped that from attractive girl on the cover that there would at least be some pretty people to look at if NOTHING else, but there wasn't even that.If you are looking for a vamp movie with a plot go buy Vampires: The Turning or something, anything besides this."
1,Rather disappointing,"I picked up this book with great expectations; in retrospect perhaps too great. Even allowing for the fact that the author is not a trained writer I found this novel disappointing. I am not an ardent Civiil War buff, though I do read a lot of Military History, yet upon reading this book I didn't learn anything new. The style of the book was also disappointing. It had the tenor of a high-school professor trying to sneak a history lesson past an unsuspecting student. There were tedious passages describing the street layout of Richmond, and repeated reminders of various characters relationship to other characters. In short, I cannot recommend this book, even though I tried to make allowances for the author. I ended up donating my copy to the local library book sale."
2,"A ""novel"" that could of been alot better","This book is semi-enjoyable for its quotes of famous individuals in the Civil War, but at the end leaves the reader unsatisfied. If the author decided to ""spicen"" up this book with more controversial individuals associated with the Confederacy, i.e. Nathan Bedford Forrest, Braxton Bragg, and added some life to these members and others in the book, it could of been a treat to read. The author decided to use to much direct quotes from individuals, and did not use his own imagination to make the life, court martial and thoughts of Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis and others more interesting. Overall a dry and unsatisfying read."
1,Faulty Research,"I do not usually read novels about the Civil War and especially about the Lee family, but having read a review of this book in an old issue of Civil War Times, I decided to break the rule. Big mistake. I have only started the book and find that the author chose to write about General Robert E. Lee without doing enough research to even get the sequence of his sons correctly. Rooney Lee was the middle son, and was never called Mr. Boo. That honor belonged to the oldest son, George Washington Custis Lee, who would have been 31 in December, 1863, not 21. If this author didn't care enough to get these simple facts right, why would I believe that the rest of his research which he used to weave his fictional story with could be anything like correct. and what enjoyment would I find in reading a story in which I have to check every historical reference to see if it is factual or not. I will probably finish the book, but not for enjoyment, simply to see how many mistakes have been made."
2,"Neat idea, poor execution","As with three of the previous four reviewers, I also didn't like this book. Two stars for a good idea, but the book disappoints greatly. For someone who did seven years of research, the author makes a variety of errors of fact. Also, the novel develops very slowly -- the trial of Lee doesn't start until the book is 1/3rd completed. Any student of the Civil War could skip really big chunks of the narrative, too, because there's way too much analysis of secondary characters and previous campaigns. A really unsatisfying read."
5,Best Game of all times,I AM SERIOUS BATTLEFRONT 2 IS THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD I GOT IT TODAY. THE MANGA GAURDS THE JEDI HEROS THE STORY THE GRAPHICS! ITS ALL THE Best .. I do hope you enjoy this game as much as i do and i hope someday to face you online! its fun so just try it and i have to say i am a diehard starwars fan but i am not bias to this game because i didnt like bf 1 as much as halo 2 but this triples halo and 20000 bf 1
5,Awesome!,"I own both Battlefront I and Battlefront II. They are both AWESOME (awesome is a complete understatement). If you are a diehard Star Wars fan, like me, you will love these games. You can play as a jedi and fight in space in the second game. I have played virtually every Star Wars game for PC, PS2, and Xbox, and this game is among the top 10. Even if you are not a diehard Star Wars fan, or not a fan at all even, you will still like this game."
2,Things just got worse,The Biggest problem in this game is the AI there all freakin Idiots they have no brains there not strategic like they were in the first in the first one they were so much smarter and harder to take out.Every now and then you might find one of your allies running into a wall or theyll forget to fire there weopons there that stupidNot only that but all the great levels are gone Bespin is gone completly Rhen Var doesnt exist and the Kasyk level sucks all the new levels suck corascant sucks Dagobah is a stinker the new Geonousis which is were the clone wars took place is now a boring desert.Each team starts off with only 150 guys in the first it was 200 soOver All crappy maps retarded AI and shorter battlesSpace Battles arnt as good as they look.Being a Jedi is alright but a bit stupid.So if you want big maps smarter enemys and Bigger Battles get the first cause the seconds not real great
4,Battlefront 2- good game,When I got Battlefront 2 a few weeks ago I played it for about 3 hours each day for a week.It was so fun!But then eventually It started to get REALLY boring.So now I just play splitscreen with my friend.Good:(1)Dogfights in space are awesome!(2)A LOT of new types of soldiers including the clone commander and rebel smuggler.(3)More chaotic battlefields.(4)New locations to battle.Bad:(1)Jedi and Sith are killed way too easily.(2)You are the only person who fixes your ship.(3)In Jabba's palace I always fall into the pit with the monster.(4)Game is too easy.
3,Great Star Wars immersion,"The game provides a very entertaining first person shooter experience. The campaigns are short, well directed and do not involve highly complex maps, so the difficulty level is in the action volume vs. the navigation. The ability to use vehicles is a nice feature, but the space battles are bit too difficult to control. A fine game for a beginner or intermediate gamer. Multiplayer in split screens is quite fun, but less cooperative than in other games."
3,Battlefrin II for Xbox,"My son really LOVES this game, played it before at his cousins however, we have the NEW Xbox 360 and I am REAL disappointed that it wasn't clear that I needed an external hardrive - why wasn't it specified?"
4,One of the Best Star Wars game,"Not only is it one of the best Star Wars games out there for the Xbox, but also it's one of the best Xbox games made. It has everything one would dream of in a Star Wars game. If you are the kind of person that loves to watch the battle scenes in movies... more like live for them and just want the plot to move quickly so that you can watch the next battle scene. Then this is the game for you!"
5,Excellent,This was the second time we purchased this game. We lost the first one. It is definately worth the re-buy.
3,as good as the first but little better,"Loved the first one, like the second. Yes they added space combat,after a couple of times it is just the same. Ground combat is still the same just a couple of extra characters thrown in. Plus by the time you unlock some of the characters the battle is just about done. a good game to rent but not to buy. after 4 days I'm bored with it. Maybe in a month it'll be fun for a couple more hours."
4,Awesome Game,"The game has a great campagin, and the fact you can be jedi when you are doing well in a battle. Also I like how they take right from the movies and put the certain heros or villians in those certains battles it makes the game much more like the movie and much more enjoyable to play.The online play is great except I think they should have more lobbies open before the game but that is my opionion. But I gave the game a four stars because it is great game to play but at some points can be frustrating and even boring. But this game is a grat 3rd person shooter for any gamer."
5,Better than the oringal,"Everything about this game is better than the orignal. There's more levels; more challenging gameplay; better online features; superior graphics; more weapons and veicles. There's also levels where you can fly, which you can skip over. If your a fan of the original, you will love this one."
3,GIft,My grandson wanted this game for his birthday. He said it was a great game. Personally I did not play it.
5,"""Impressive , most impressive!""","This is by far THE best Star Wars game I've ever played. More soldier classes, more planets, you can have dogfights in space and you can play as a jedi knight. This is a hard game to put down. Limitless scenarios and game play will keep you occupied for hours on end. I picked up this game back in November and I still play it on occasion. The only down side is the lack od squad control. This sequel limits you to the basic ""follow me"" or ""break off"" commands. Maybe for lack of memory or just simply to distiguish itself from ""Republic Command"". Aside from this very minor gripe, the game itself is flawless. So pick it up today and have fun fight the evil empire or ""rebel scum""! You won't be dissapointed"
3,Quality,The quality of the disc was suspect.The game did not last for too many plays.I will think twice next time.
1,boring,I had high hopes for this book as one that dealt with motherhood and sex. Wrong. Two pages on that and not helpful. Just more stories of porn. Old.
4,"Small, but packed with information","It might be under 400 pages, but this book has a lot of information in it. It's basically one concise data book about the 8051, with questions at the end of each chapter that make it useful as a textbook. It also has several useful appendices, including a listing of the assembly commands and an appendix that shows the binary for each command, as well as the number of machine cycles it takes to execute.I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who's not familiar with assembly and the architecture of a processor, because the book assumes you know assembly language in one form or another, and it doesn't spend a lot of time on the architecture of the 8051."
3,This book lacks good examples!,"Thi book is not for beginners. The author describes the microcontroller's functions in detail but lacks as far as examples. Most descriptions are 1 paragraph long with 1 example and the problem solving section is useless because the information is limited unless, looking through other 8051 books. The projects are outdated,(the author) still uses an 8155 as an example and no LCD examples! The Relocatable segment directives also lacks depth and good solid examples. I hardly use the book anymore, its not worth the $115 CDN I paid for."
5,very useful,"if you are interested in microcontrollers, and want to learn about the most famous microcontroller 8051, you must read this book. you will not need any other books."
4,Forever Soul,"Once again, similar to the ""Heart & Soul"" Album, I think a wonderful job has been done on producing such a solid combination of Old school songs, in instrumental. This album brings back Good memories of a ""By gone"" era. You would probably not find a better compilation of R&B Instrumental songs. All credit to the musicians & producers of this album."
1,not in great shape,I didn't expect much for the price but the book was in such poor condition I couldn't give it as a gift. I am in the process of finding another one. I expect a dust jacket but the interior of the cover for this book was lined in foil as to mock the beach reflectors used in the 70's. The inside cover was torn out and there was no dust jacket.I was hoping to at least have the kitschy foil lining but now I'm stuck with this book and I have ot find a new one.I should have asked about the condition in detail before ordering.oh well...
3,"I hate to say it, but...","it's not so great. Logan's Run is of course a classic, and the little-known second story. Logan's World, is a masterpeice -- possibly my favorite science fiction novel, certainly in the top five. So when I recently discovered there was a third novel, I had to get it. Unfortunately, it really wasn't anything special. It wasn't bad, exactly; I love Nolan's writing style. He's brilliant. But this story of Logan being sent to a mirror world to virtually re-write history never really takes off. The aliens tell him not to seek out the Jessica of that world, but of course, we're hoping he will, and he does... but even that never really gets interesting. There's a couple of twists at the end, which I'll admit I didn't see coming,but it's like, so what? The story as a whole is sort of like that, too. Again, it's not terrible, but don't go out of your way for it. Sorry, Nolan. Read Logan's World instead!"
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Logan's Search, the third book in the Logan series, is really pretty pointless. It takes him out of the setting of the first couple, and has a lot of elements of do it all again.Exploring further what was going on originally, on his own world, would have been a much better idea."
3,Good but no classic,"It is amazing to me that a series as full of holes and inconsistancies as this one can still be not only enjoyable, but gripping. I didn't see the main premise of the story-line coming and was interested to know what would happen to the main character. That said, I feel the characters were rather black and white in either evil or goodness, characters' emotions were not explored in enough detail, the author did not make use of her own smoking guns and she seemed to consistantly forget that her characters had been told something the chapter before and set them up in the next chapter as if they had never been told. This is good but will never be a classic."
3,A fair ending to a great series,"The wonderful character development throughout The Quickening kind made me wish that McIntosh would have continued on with the series, but... the ending to Bridge of Souls is abrupt and really does wrap up all the issues. I loved the journey of getting to the end of this trilogy, but the final scenes left me hoping for something different. The ""solution"" to the Quickening just was too obvious, in my mind."
5,Great Scent,I received this product as a get well gift. The smell is wonderful and very relaxing. I use my reed diffuser for adding a wonderful scent to my meditation room.
1,Had Big Problems With Mine - Disable HOTSYNC???? WHAT???,"The concept is great...the end result leaves a lot to be desired. For starters there is no installation info. Insert the disk and print out the Adobe instructions...CHEAP! Easy to install but you have to disable Hotsync on some...which was mine and it's only a year old. Then I would insert it in the back and it would play but when I set it down and I don't mean drop...set it down it would reset everything and give me a fatal error and reset my palm. Then I would have to turn my hotsync back on, sync up and try again. As for online help it's ok but nothing special. I don't recommend this product. If it's not built in already...don't add it."
1,Nothing but problems,"I've had nothing but problems with my minijam. First it wouldn't work when I put it in my Visor. It's supposed to just power up but it wouldn't. When it finally did, I encountered one problem after another. Numerous times I've had to reset my visor, Re-install the palm desktop software, reformat the MM Card because all the songs mysteriously disappear and the card is suddenly unformatted, and I've had plenty of fatal errors which required re-booting my computer. The customer support is okay but now I'm supposed to pay shipping charges to send back the faulty product to Innogear. So if you do buy it don't purchase it directly from them! When it works it's fantastic but overall it's a major disappointment."
1,A $95 Paperback? Amazon must be joking!,"Based on all the reviews I've read about P. C Hodgell and how much her fans like her work, I was ready and willing to order this book, until I saw the $95 price tag. I mean who sells paperback books for $95? The exorbitant price Amazon is asking for this book makes too rich for my budget, so even though I would like to read it, I'm going to pass on this one. Come on Amazon, pull your head out & make Seeker's Mask available at a more reasonable price, in line with others of the same genre. If you do then I will buy it and withdraw my comments."
2,Hodgell Rocks!,"This is an absolute must-have for any fantasy reader. I have read and re-read her books and eagerly anticipate the arrival of the next ones to find out what happens.The characters within have a depth to them that is really pretty impressive. The detail in the cultures and the world has astounded me. Can you tell that I am a Hodgell fan yet? I won't go into the details on the storyline, you owe it to yourself to buy the book and find out for yourself.Every fantasy lover owes it to themselves to do that"
5,128 pages of excellent movie info!,"Thunderbirds may not have succeeded at the box office, but this book is F-A-B! It's 128 pages of pure info and great images, including some images you don't see in the movie at all, such as a wicked shot of Alan and Fermat on a hoversled. The book is very enjoyable for those who love to know as many details as possible."
4,Thunderbirds Book Fun,"It came in a timely manner and was in a good condition. The price tag on the book and the price I actually paid was very different (the tag much much less) , though, which kind of bothered me. Anyway, pretty goo job."
2,glenn miller golden hits,got my cd today. this is a remake of glenn songs and not good. if you want the real thing dont buy this cd. song are not played the same way
5,Outstanding Promotional CD,"Hallmark put out this CD for Valentines Day. It includes 8 songs that were handpicked by Martina. It went gold in just one week following it's release.The song list includes classic Martina Love Songs including""Valentine,"" ""All The Things We've Never Done,"" ""Born To Give My Love To You"" and ""In My Daughter's Eyes,"" as well as the Etta James classic ""At Last"" and Buck Owens's ""Together Again"" which were recorded especially for the project.Although it was never intended to be anything other than a Hallmark promotion. This CD, although short, stands on it's own.It has gone Gold and is headed for Platinum. Quite remarkable."
3,mellow music,This cd is very mellow and short. It's nice but not something I think about playing real often.
3,Hey... is this an album or an EP?,"Okay, so we've already had the Greatest Hits album, and now this? Actually, it's a lovely collection--particularly the dreamy ""At Last"", but to release an album that contains rereleased material that is only 27 minutes long falls short on value, in my mind. And most of the tracks are less than three and a half minutes, too. Long gone are the days when the stingey recording industry could press four-tracks-a-side vinyl albums and get away with it. Come on Martina--there's room on this for at least another four to six numbers, don't you think?That aside, I have no gripes about the quality whatsoever--just the quantity."
4,pretty good combo,This combo works well. However the range of the keyboard is short. I had to place the reciever within 3 feet of the keyboard for it to communicate. Also the keyboard legs are a little short so it lays too flat. Otherwise it performs flawlessly.
5,Good value,"This set is a great value. I loved getting rid of all the cords on my desktop for not much more than the price of a cordless mouse. Mouse seemed a little fast at first, but I've gotten used to it, keyboard is normal in every way. I recharge the mouse once in awhile, it keeps going with no problems."
2,Not as good as other Logitech models,"I have had this keyboard and mouse at my office for 1.5 years. While I am a big fan of Logitech products having had many webcams, keyboards and mice over the years, and have a different model Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse at home, this one at my office has not held up as well. The keyboard functions perfectly as it should, but the letters on the keys have been wearing off for months. The following letters are totally gone - e, o, g, l, c, b, n, m., with the rest on their way. I have never had a keyboard where this has happened. The other problem is that the mouse's batteries need to be replaced every 2-3 weeks, and on the keyboard, about every six months. It has been this way since the beginning. Comparatively, on my home set, used as frequently, the batteries are changed about every four or five months on the mouse, and have only been changed twice on the keyboard in three years. Big difference!"
4,"Academic? Yes, but that's a good thing","I appreciate the consistency of exposition, especially when explaining recursion of execution and recursive datatypes using basis and induction cases. It's a book for those who are interested in the crossover between CS theory and mathematics, but only introductory calculus is necessary (and that's only in one section). If you come from a procedural programming background, as I did, this book is an excellent introduction to the techniques of functional programming. I would recommend reading this in conjunction with ML for the Working Programmer by Paulson. If you are looking for a gentler introduction to functional languages, like LISP and its sister Scheme, try The Little Schemer by Friedman and Felleisen."
4,Prehistoric Life,"An excellent book based on the series Walking with Dinosaurs, Walking with Prehistoric Beasts, and Walking with Monsters. Text is sophisticated HS level. Excellent illustrations. Excellent selection of creatures from earliest to latest, including Flores man. Even though the text is a bit high for him, my 9 year old loves this book and we often read the selections at bedtime."
3,Good but needs a little extra,"Another good book..but if you want a lot of dinosaurs, use this with other guides.This covers various prehistoric life. Not all the pages give you a good look at the animal and it only covers a small portion of dinosaurs. But because it does cover some creatures that almost never make it into guides on prehistoric life, this is a great book to use with other guides and is fun to read."
4,3 out of four ain't bad,One of the four bowls lost its fluid in transit but a quickchat from ... and they gave me a ... ... for that piece. They were very courteous on the phone. The other three stay cold true to form just like they said. Easy to clean.
5,"""Ratso"" and the Manhatten Rangers !","Although I'm not a NY Ranger's fan by any stretch of the imagination, this book is a long forgotten classic and a must read for every hockey fan. ""Ratso"", (Larry Sloman) did a great job in profiling the NY Ranger players on and off the ice and he is able to insinuate, instances of sexcapades and drug use among the players and still protect their privacy, he takes us behind the scenes of the Manhatten party life with celebrities, models and hockey players. I was able to find this book in an old inner city library sometime in the late 70's, early 80's. The chance of you finding it now are slim and nil, but if you do get a hold of it, I'm sure you'll be glad you did."
4,Montserrat Caballe is great but the recording suffers,"This is a wonderful performance of Norma. Montserrat Caballe is terrific and carries the show. The sound quality is not great; otherwise I would have rated it a 5. This CD is worth owning, however, despite the problems with its recording."
3,"Great shape, but doesn't last long","Well, the shape of the pen is what I'm after, but unlike the regular pens that this company sells, the highlighters don't have refills. Unfortunately, they run out very quickly. But I don't see any other choices on the market, so I bought a bunch of these. For anyone who has problems writing and/or holding a pen, this would be a good product to give a try. They are the only ones I am able to use comfortably."
1,Save you money,"Don't fall for the commercials. Just buy the correct tool for the job. These little things claim to cut through anything. That is true, for the first 10 minutes. It started out cutting through tile grout like a knife through hot butter, but then 10 min later, couldn't cut anything. I changed attached and bought the upgrade kind at home depot and have not used it since. Buy the right tools and save you money."
4,good little tool,"Pretty happy with this. It takes some getting used to; would be nice to have a variable speed setting for those cuts you're not totally confident about. The button that locks the spindle for bit changing fell out, so I have to keep it with my tools to put back in when I need to change the bit. The guide vibrates itself loose too; have to get in the habit of tightening the lock nut after every so many cuts. Overall, it does its job. The price was right and I have had no problems with any reconditioned tools I've bought through Amazon (porter cable framing nailer, bostitch finish nailers + compressor and this). It makes a ton of dust so be prepared."
5,Scotto and Bergonzi=Heaven,"First of all, the sound quality of this recording is very acceptable and you could do far worse with some digital versions (Pavarotti/Battle or Carreras/Ricciarelli). As for the performance itself, well, it's vintage Italian singing. The important thing about this recording is that neither Carlo Bergonzi nor Renata Scotto recorded this opera commercially, so for their performances alone this set is priceless. Bergonzi sings a youthful, passionate Nemorino surpassed on records only by Giuseppe Di Stefano. Renata Scotto invariably gives a masterclass on true belcanto style, no other soprano of her generation was a better Adina, so we are very grateful indeed for this recording. If you want a digital version I can only recommend the Alagna/Devia version on ERATO."
1,Pathetic sound quality,"I must beg to differ with the other reviewers,for,to me, the sound quality of this CD renders it unlistenable. Hearing it over the telephone would be preferable. No attempt was apparently made to remaster the dictaphone-like recording.Thumbs down."
5,Great for beginners,"I have made a few beautiful quilts and it didn't take me a long time to finish any of them. I have received many compliments and have been asked if I have been quilting for a long time...Nope, it's only been a few months! The instructions in the book are easy to follow, and the results are fufilling and wonderful! Have fun!"
4,Teen Tips at your Fingertips,"Tom McMahon's, ""Teen Tips"" is a great manuel for parents with adolescence. It's categorized, so it's easy to just pick up and go straight to your interest without having to read the whole book. My husband doesn't often have the patience to sit down and read, so McMahon's practical, informative handbook works well at giving teen tactics at a glance. I found many of the parents suggestions valuable and have implemented some in my own home. It was conforting as a parent to read about commonalities in the experiences of raising a teen."
4,A Great Book For Parents With Teens Or Pre-teens,"Tom's book contains a huge amount of ideas and suggestions for keeping lives sane- both parent's and teen's. If you have teens, this is a must read. Even if you only gain one new insight, it is worth it. Both you and your child will benefit greatly from this helpful book. It will help you maintain or build a good relationship with your teen."
4,Teen Tips A Pratical Survival Guide for Parents with Kids,"This book is a must for all parents of preteens and teens. Having two sons, a preteen and teen, I was lost at figuring out how to let them be young responsible adolescents. Many of the household rules my husband and I tried to implement were broken. Upon reading TEEN TIPS we were able to find different ways to work with our sons. The best tip I found was just listen to your teen. I found myself listening but not giving my full attention to my sons. Now I take the time and effort to listen to them. This new found trust allows them to come and talk to me without any hesitation. I now cherish the time I have with each son as he comes to talk to me. Thanks Tom for creating this extraoridinary book."
4,Parents: answers you need are finally here!,"I found Teen Tips,Tom McMahon, to be a very resourceful book for whatever stage of parenting you are in. I have shared this book with family and friends who are discovering the challenges of raising an adolescent. It is beneficial for parents to realize that thier situation is not unique, there are other parents who have experienced the same challenges(and survived). By being able to utilize some of the parental survial skills, and reaffirming my ""parental rights"" has been inspiring in connecting with teens in my family. I encourage parents to add this book to thier collection and use as your own personal referral. Thank you Tom McMahon!"
1,For those who secretly want their children to just die already.,"This book endorses the methods used by WWASP (World Wide Association of Speciality Programs). This says it all.Google ""WWASP Abuse,"" or ""WWASP lawsuit,"" or go to CAICA's website, and you'll instantly see what I'm talking about.If you want to permanently sever the relationship you have with your kids for the rest of your life (I'm talking to the point where they literally dance on your grave after you die), then by all means, buy this book! I speak from experience, if you know what I mean..."
3,"Good album, but...","This was a good album, very funny, but there are a few problems that I have with it. First of all, the part where T. Bubba does the ""Wichaiddya"" thing is directly stolen from Jeff Foxworthy. Second, the ""Igmo"" thing is an almost direct rip-off of Bill Engvall's ""Here's Your Sign"" routine. And lastly, the part where he talks about airplane safety, especially ""place the mask of your face and breath normally"" is stolen almost directly from George Carlin's ""Jammin' in New York"" album. Other than that, I'm completly satisfied with this album."
3,Its OK.,Editors review shows 14 amp but the machine is only 9 amp. At first I thought is was not working properly due to its power output. Upon reading further in manufacturers literature we found it to be rated at 9 amps. My wife likes the size and mobility and it picks up OK. It is a pretty good machine for the price.
2,Not what I wanted.,"I just sold this back through Amazon, I was so disapointed with it. It's an all cover record, and while Greg Duhli does add an interesting twist to the covers, all of the music feels too subdued, too flat.Duhli is lacking the usual passion he brought to the Whigs and the first Twilight Singers recording."
5,It really works,"This product amazes me. I do not always get my dishes washed for a bit...or until I run out of dishes...which ever comes last. Anyways, I had my pots and pans with some heavy baked on mess and normally I always end up having to scrub it long and hard. This time however when I went shopping I found this at the store. All you have to do is spray it in (no need to add water) and in like 10 min you can just wipe it out. No scrubbing necessary. Also, what you can do is just spray it on your pots and pans and stick them in the dishwasher. Just thought I would share what works for a bachelor like me. <(*_*)>"
5,My kitchen cannot survive without this product!,"For cleaning roasting pans, grills or other cook ware with food stuck on them, this is the best cleaning solution."
2,Overpriced on amazon,"I was eager to get this and give it a try on my stainless steel grill. I am working on that still, so I'll update with info on how well the product works for that purpose. I didn't shop around much since I saw many reviews that said this was not widely available in stores. This is more of a review of the seller. Shipping took longer than average. I was surprised when the item arrived in a Walmart.com box/label. It appears from the shipping labels this seller actually marks up and resells the item & it's shipped from walmart.com. Now, I understand some people may just prefer buying from amazon and don't mind the mark up. But for me, I'm all for capitalism, but blatant mark ups by amazon sellers just seems sleazy. So, skip the middle man and consider buying directly from the walmart site for $2.83 plus 97cent shipping."
2,Amazing Power Dissolver,"I have used this product extensively, but can no longer find it available at any retail facility in the town where I live. Rather than ruin my good kitchen utensils, it became a mission to locate this product. The first place I knew to google was Amazon.com, SUCCESSFULLY! It is an amazing product; I can clean my utensils without waiting for my housekeeper's weekly schedule at my house."
4,Works well!,"I bought this primarily to clean the cooking grid on my gas grill. I hadn't cleaned this in a looong time so it was pretty grungy. The Dawn Power Dissolver did the trick. I took the grid off the grill and sat it on four bricks so that it was suspended above the patio surface. I sprayed the Dawn on it and let it sit for about 15 minutes then took my high pressure washer and blasted it off. The grid, which is stainless steel, came out looking almost like new. A second treatment the next day really finished it off nicely. Go Dawn!!!"
2,Weak ending...,The book builds up the tension well and the way the story is told is interesting. But the big negative for me was the weak ending- the built up tension basically goes no where and nothing happens to trump the books (great) opening chapter's events.
4,From the first to the last page:a pure delight,"I just finished to read ""The Watcher"" for the fourth time and I'm still enchanted by the prose of Charles Maclean.Even after four times, I keep on finding new clues, new diabolic plots. One of the best novel I've read"
4,Great video,"I have dusted this video and slide off after about 4 years of having it. I am loving it. Great for beginners, though I wish Reebok had produced a more advanced routine as well. This video is great for fat burning and also for great legs (your legs use the same action as skaters do - and they have great legs!)"
4,If you like quirky books..,"you'll love this one. If you don't, stay away. I've recommended Willeford to a couple of people who found him boring and pointless. If you enjoy deadpan prose, offbeat humor and a large dose of arcane knowledge you'll enjoy this a lot."
1,Facts vs fiction,"A book written in 1993 forecasts the immediate downfall of the Castro regime. Twelve years later, Castro remains. The book? Barely there... just a compilation of old Cuban exiles and Dept of State cliches. It's amazing this guy still finds newspapers willing to buy his stuff and people willing to believe him. I guess the reader's short attention span issues are more acute than we thought."
1,Same old Same old,"For someone who portrays himself as the expert on the reality of Latin America, Openheimer once again displays his ignorance of the facts.My advice to Openheimer is to write about something which he knows better. The corruption tied to neo-liberalism and it's failure to rescue Latin America from economic despair.With this book he pays lip service and tribute to a very narrow segment of the cuban american population in the city where he resides, comfortably writing from an ivory tower."
5,This a wonderful and informative book,"This book fills a unique place in the literature for children whose parents have to travel for work. Told through the eyes of Awesome, the family's pet hamster, it takes its young readers through the roller coaster of emotions that they often feel when a parent travels and offers guidance and advice on how to stay connected to their traveling parent.As an added bonus, the illustrations are really amazing."
1,Nice Illustrations; Story Unimpressive,"The illustrations are very playful, but the prose leaves a lot to be desired."
4,Excellent,This is where America is headed even though it was written by a Soviet Union woman in the 1950's who had the foresight to tell us what we have to look forward to now.
5,Better than I thought,"I bought the CliffNotes on Ayn Rand's Atlas shrugged because I wanted to know how it ended faster than having to read all the way through the novel. Never having used any CliffNotes before I was pleasantly surprised to find how detailed and informative they are. It covered plot, characters, reasoning and background information that I never would have gotten from just reading the novel. If you want to know the inside story, this is the place to get it without pain."
3,Atlas Cliff Notes,It's ok. It's a bit wordy for me. I think this book is a valuable tool for those in school who are reqired to read the book.
4,I enjoy CliffsNotes,"What can I say? I wanted to do a quick read to get caught up to watch the movie. Rand may have been a bit much on her ideas, but close enough to see how a society can like a frog in cold water slowly be cooked/lead to a new way of thinking and reliance upon others/Gov't and not themselves."
3,Atlas Shrugged,Although the author is highly praised for writing ability - the content of this book did not coincide with my philosophies. To me it smaks of anti-God recognition and I didn't read further.
2,Does Not Do Justice to Atlas Shrugged,"Just read the book. Having read both, your teacher (if competent) will know you read the Cliff's Notes for Atlas Shrugged."
4,Excellent singing on this fine live recording,"Having Mirella Freni sing with such full golden tone is a luxury in this bel canto role and though her top notes are tentative the quality is beyond doubt,Callas is of course better equipped for Elvira but she was never partnered by Pavarotti whose clear,mellifluous tones breathe life into Arturo only occasionally being strained by the high tessitura,these two produce magnificant singing!Bonaldo Giaiotti is a paragon amongst basses, refined but firmly resonant with an outstanding technique only Bruscantini falls below par being dry and under characterising the role of Riccardo,Muti conducts well seeming more flexible here than he was to become and the orchestra responds adequately,the quality of this live recording is more than acceptable."
5,The best book about competitive intelligence,"The discipline of competitive intelligence is new and confusing, but Kahaner makes it easy to understand. His real life examples are excellent and his writing is clear and crisp. After reading this book, our managers were able to institute some of his how-to ideas and it has saved us money. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand what competitive intelligence is all about."
4,Really good foundational information,This book provided a really good foundational review of a CI program. It's a bit out of date otherwise I would have given it a 5 star rating.
2,Very Disappointing,"I learned of this book while reading the ""Ask Annie"" column in Fortune (Jan. 7, 2002). I've been in Marketing for 10 years and was looking forward to a good book on competitive intelligence gathering. This covers only the most basic of topics: the plan, do, check, act cycle; annual reports; 10-Qs; government permits; etc. If you don't have a clue where to start in CI you may find this book helpful. If you've done even cursory competitive intelligence gathering before you will not likely find anything new here.I should have paid attention to the reviewer that said, ""If this is the FIRST book you read on Competitive Intelligence - it is not that bad..."" I'll add not only if this is the first book, but also your first exposure, otherwise skip it."
2,Journalists take on CI,"This is a basic treatment of the field that adds the journalistic element that has been lacking in many other treatments. That has its good and bad points. The good points is that it is likely to drum up interest in the field by those outside of it. The bad point is that it somewhat sensationalizes it for those of us who do it on a day to day basis. Nevetheless, it is a comprehensive overview of CI and provides for interesting anectdotes and stories to share to the general public. I just got this a few weeks ago and it is also now appearing a bit dated but that is understandable as it was likely written several years ago. Overall, a fairly interesting book that will be of some value to individuals who need to understand why CI might be a desirable career pursuit."
3,Good--but dated,"Great read, and a very easy read. This book is more of an introduction to the philosophy of Competitive Intelligence than anything else. It provides a good conceptual overview.The chief failing of the book is that the world has changed since it was written five years ago. It'd be interesting to see how an updated book would justify CI in a ""down"" economy, and how its importance has changed with the bursting of the dotcom bubble.It's still a worthwhile read, but I would rather see a book that has been updated to current world and economic conditions."
5,honeylocust is the best.,"everyone should own at least one copy of this cd, it may be the best record put out within the past 10 years. i dont even like ska, but i freakin' love honeylocust.i wish theyd do a reunion tour, or put out a dvd or something- im sure they have some killer footage.i love kevin snow and reggie youngblood. forever."
5,Leaving Protection,My daughter read this book over the summer and loved it! It was an exciting story and a fast read. She would definitely recommend it to other middle school students.
3,Could be Sturdier,"Yes it works....Yes it is a good bargan for the buck... but no, it is not as sturdy as the American Girl stands. In my opinion the base is not wide enough, so the dolls weight is not distributed over a larger area. The result is that the doll is a bit wobbely. Worse than I would prefer. I display my dolls in intricate clothing and accessories. With the American Girl stand, I can easily put the doll in it and add on the finishing touches. This one doesn't quite work as well because it is wobbely. And of course if you are using higher quality clothing (read: heavier) or if you have numerous layers on your doll (read: victorian underclothing or a hooded cape)...wobbely then turns to borderline fall-over. Personally, I'd say skip this item.... unless you are looking for a cheaper quick-fix."
1,Don't recommend,"I purchased this for my graduate classes. It goes through batteries so quickly! (~6-7 hours of recording it needs new ones... so with 2-3 classes a day, I was going through large packs of batteries in no time)In addition to that complaint, the software is awful, and you have to convert the files to WAV format, THEN MP3... time consuming!"
4,Good not great,Its a good recorder. Thought the battery gets depleted very quickly. I like the FM built in. The recording quality is good but could be better in terms of noise reduction.
4,Sony Voice Recorder with USB,"I love this recorder. My main purpose is to record my own voice. Would love it more if the batteries lasted longer. But, no complaints as a recorder. For MP3 listening I use Creative Zen that goes 16 hours on one AAA."
4,It's great for voice chat,I really liked it as the voice quality is great and even the sound output is fantastic. The only drawback is that you can't use it for long time as it becomes uncomfortable. It can adjusted in proper position in your ears and can be used for long period.
3,Logitech premium stereo headset,"This appears to be a well made set, however, the voice quality is disappointing. The headset speakers are fine, however, both the sent and received voice appear to be in a tunnel and lack a natural sound."
2,disappointed,while the headphones are actually pretty good when listening to music or gaming the mic only seemed to work when my mouth was right in front of it. requiring the headphones to be twisted so the ear peice was almost on my eye. if the mic is this sensitive then they should make a longer boom. wanted more...
2,Uncomfortable,"I tried this out and almost immediately decided to return it. The headband is made of plastic, and so cannot be banned or otherwise adjusted. I wear an average hat size, so I know my head is not that big, but this thing really hurt to wear. As others have noted, the padding is very thin and not very soft. Also, the padding rests on the ear itself, rather than forming a seal around it. The result is a tight fitting headset with minimal padding crushing your ears. The only redeeming quality of this product is that the microphone worked pretty well with my voice recognition software. It didn't matter though, as I couldn't manage to wear it for any length of time that made it worth keeping."
4,Excellent Headphones,Note: This product is actually 'Premium Stereo Headset' with Noise-canceling Mic.Quality is excellent.
4,Good value for money!,Superb quality! Comfortable to the user and I am satisfied. I only wish the microphone was attached to the left side of the headset!
5,Great product and great price.,This particular product I bought from Reforger a great company that sold me this headset (refurbished) but look brand spanking new. If you are looking for a good headset for your computer then get this product and get it from Reforger because they have the cheapest price I ever seen. Great product and great price.
2,Not So Good,"I originally bought this product for the microphone, as I needed it to be able to use Skype and Voice (SecondLife) But the microphone didn't work. The sound quality of the headphones were fine. But then after about a month the whole thing just broke. First one of the earpeices fell off, then the other one did. So I got a different headset by a different company, and it works just fine for me."
2,"Good sound, but poor design","I was initially very pleased with these headphones, but after using them for about two months they started having problems. I noticed that switching the position of the microphone seemed to change performance significantly. After 4 months, only certain frequencies could be heard. I finally got fed up with them and decided to see what the problem was.Sure enough, the microphone hinge is held by a screw and nut that fray the wires that run through that portion of the unit. Further up that side of the unit, I noticed that the fit adjustment groove also frays the wire that runs through it. With these design flaws, I don't expect anyone to get more than six months of normal use out these headphones."
3,Noise Cancelling-What is it really?,"I recently purchased this product. it is very comfortable and appears to be working fine, my only isue is with the noise cancelling microphone. ahow exactly does it work. I recorded somthing recently and I could still hear a whole heap of noise in the background. I thought that noise cancelling meant I wouldn't get that background noise, oh well I could be wrong. Other than that I would say it is a good product."
2,Uncomfortable and not durable,I've had these headphones for about 13 months now. I've gone through through two pairs in that time. One in 10 months and the other in 3. In both circumstances they shorted out near the earpiece. They are also rather uncomfortable and start to pinch on your ears and head after only a short while of wearing.
2,"Ok at first, broke after extended use. Mic not great. Look elsewhere...","I am online searching for a new gaming headset now as these broke, right on the side where they adjust into the plastic, so now they are trash. You get what you pay for. I usually love Logitech products, but this is not one I love. The mic was never great, people constantly having trouble hearing me even after lots of tweaking. I have a high-end sound card on my PC and this set just didn't do anything great with it.Going to spend a bit more after I read review and get something nicer since I use it so much.Look elsewhere."
2,Microphone sends noisy distracting sound when moved,"There is some comfort, BUT when the microphone is adjusted, there is a static sound that interupts conversation. Logitec needs to do further engineering on the product."
2,Good sound quality. Extremely uncomfortable to wear. Mic sucks.,"I am no audiophile, but i think the sound quality is decent. If you turn the volume to MAX, the sound quality deteriorates a little.I can not believe how uncomfortable this headphone is. The ear piece is so small that it does not cover the entire ear. And therefore it hurts cause it bends your ear. You can wear it for no longer than 5 min.I bought this mainly to use for internet chat. But the mic is weirdly placed and as mentioned before you have to speak loudly for the other person to hear you. You have to speak very clearly for the mic to register your voice, otherwise it will just filter out some parts thinking it to be noise.Overall, I am disappointed with the purchase. I guess i will keep it as a spare."
2,Uncomfortable Headset,"I bought two of these ( wife and myself ) and wish I hadn't. They are very uncomfortable to wear for more than 15 minutes because they cause my ears to hurt. I do wear glasses, so that may be contributing to the discomfort. My previous ( Plantronics ) headset was much more comfortable.I use them during online gaming where I need a headset for 3+ hour sessions and these just won't do.The sound quality is ok for my uses. The microphone isn't as good as my previous set, based on comments from the people communicating with me."
4,Good Headset,"I bought this headset over a month ago. Its excellent when it comes to sound quality and microphone sensitivity. Its light and sturdy. The only drawback for this item is that after wearing it for long time your ears ache a little bit, but overall its good value for money."
3,Uncomfortable and muffled sound reproduction,"I find these headphones to be very uncomfortable, but to be fair, I find most headphones uncomfortable. I also wear glasses, which makes it more difficult to find headphones that don't press on my ears in the wrong way. I also think that the sound quality is poor. Almost all frequencies sound ""muffled"". However, for the price, it is difficult to find headphones with a noise-cancelling mic. So that is why these get a 3 and not a 2."
2,Volume control does not work,Received product on time and in good condition. Sound is great for price. A little uncomfortable when wearing for long periods. My main complaint is that the volume control on the set I received does not work at all. I will be returning item for an exchange. I will update review after that process. If volume controll worked rating would be higher.
1,Didn't work,I would never recommend this product. I bought this item about 6 weeks ago and it didn't work when I received it. I haven't had time to send it back. Also I was afraid to pay for the postage and never get a refund. That means a bigger damage and has happened to me before.
2,Not the best -- looks good in the picture but does not perform well,"I'm surprised that this headset received great reviews from some reviewers. I bought it to replace a Labtec Axis 502 that I've had for 5 years and was falling apart (can only hear from the left side earphone). However, this Logitech headset has been a disappointment for the following reasons:a) Uncomfortable and bulkyb) When chatting in SkyPe, I can barely hear, and the person I'm talking to can barely hear me.c) When listening to music, the music sounds very muffled.I'm not sure whether this headset is good for gaming since I've not used it with any games but as far as SkyPe and music are concerned, it is useless. It's even worse (by a magnitude of at least 200%) than the 5-year old Labtec that it was supposed to replace"
1,Mic did not work,"My main problem was that the mic did not work at all. I tried it on two computers, and got the same result - it did not record. Also, the earphones are not comfortable."
1,another lousy product from gadgettech,Save your money and buy a Plantronics headset. Unconfortable and poor sound. Stay away.
1,Bad Article,After using it two weeks and I worked more .... The article was in used condition and I am very disappointed by this purchase.
5,love it!!!!!!!!!,I just love them and enoy them i use them for my work @ home job when i was employed from home
2,Headphone part works intermittently,"I bought 2 sets of these as presents. They worked fine for a while, but now both have the same problem. I can't get any sound in the headset itself, or only intermittent sound. The microphone picks up sound well, but the way I currently have to use them, with the headset around my neck and the mouthpiece pointing up, isn't exactly practical. I wouldn't recommend this product."
1,"don't buy, very bad quality","Very uncomfortable headset, ears hurt badly after only 30 minutes of wearing it.Microphone died after a few month.Stay away, don't waste your money. I won't buy logitech again!"
2,I have bought this 3 times,"When i bought it the first time around, it worked nicely. Lasted long, no problems, mic was nice. Then i accidentally broke it. I bought it once again and it was awful. The headset wires had burnt out within a month and i would have to listen to everything on one side of the headset. Then it just would go out completely. I bought it again and the problem continued. It lasted for 2 months at the most time. I hope this helps."
2,bad product,"I bought it a while ago it is uncomfortable to the ears especially if u wear it for more than 30 min. the sound quality is good but the microphone doesn't work well, the people can bearly hear me when i talk to them using it, and the volume adjuster got stuck so i can't adjust it after a month and a half of its purchase."
3,It's okay,"Everything works the way it's supposed to, know that this is not a ""premium electronic"" product however...more like ""decent budget friendly."" The earphones themselves do not adjust to sit on your ears more comfortably...I found out the hard way, snapped of the headpiece from an earphone and am unable to reconnect properly; although, the overall device is still usable."
2,Uncomfortable and wasteful,"My college recommended these for an audio class I took. They lasted one semester. I loved the sound quality as they are louder than having my laptop on maximum and the mute quality makes it very convenient. I went to use them the second semester and the mic didnt work most of the first class and then kicked on spontaneously. Within a week the mic was unrecoverable. Also, since the beginning the headset was immensely uncomfortable. I tried taking my glasses off and it still didnt help. This was in the first 5 minutes of every use. Overall I would recommend looking for a better product!!!!"
2,Poor Microphone,"The sound quality and comfort was great, but people could not hear me when I talked unless I physically pushed the microphone closer to my face. I had to return the item."
1,Waste of Money,"Ordered mine, got it in decent condition, but the product does not work, at all. The wires might as well not be connected to anything as the headset just doesn't work at all."
4,Logitech Premium,"Too tight and hard, my ears are not comfort after I use it for a while.The sound result is good. Just the outside has some problems."
1,Dissappointing to the boot,"I bought this during a black friday sale and a month later, it started having the left ear not work. That happend for a week and since at that time i didnt have to use it too often, i didnt really bother. Until i needed it for skype and my boyfriend complains the microphone is always too soft, no one can ever hear me. Then i tried to adjust the wire because sometime both ears will work sometimes one ear will work. So i got it working finally after 3 weeks of one ear. Then after 2 months of two ears working, the left ear finally died meaning NO MORE signal to it, AT ALL.I love logitech stuff, i have their keyboard speakers and bought my boyfriend their G9 mouse and he loves it. But this pair of headphones is one of logitechs most undesirable items out in the market. Im trying to look for another pair of headphones. I wish Bose would make noise canceling and microphone. I would buy that up in a second.STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!"
2,Meh.,"Not recommended. I'm on my second pair of these in 1.5 years and it's already time for a new pair. I've experienced the same problem with both sets: the sound randomly decides to cut in and out on the left side, until it completely stops working. The sound itself, when it decides to work, is alright. Nothing terrible, but nothing special either.I wear these for long periods of time (mainly for use with Ventrilo or Skype), up to 3 or 4 hours, and after about an hour they become quite uncomfortable. The thing foam padding on the inside of the earpiece falls out after about a month, and the hard plastic digs into your ear. The headband isn't as comfortable as I'd like it to be, either.I've never really had a problem with Logitech products (I own their G5 mouse as well as the Logitech Quickcam), but this particular item should be on everyone's ""Avoid"" list."
5,Best headphones you can get for $10,"This is a great product. The sound clarity is amazing. The micophone quality is awesome. For those of you on a budget, this is the biggest bang for your buck. Hands down. I tried it the day I got it and the sound quality from the mic was great. Buy this one."
5,SIMPLY AWESOME.......,I just took the headphones out of the box and started using these headphones and let me tell you....simply awesome. I bought these headphones for playing my pc games and listening to music. Im listening to morris day and the time and it sounds like im in the studio with those guys. I the comfort of these headphones are awesome. I added a pad cotton to the top part of the headset that rest on your head....even better. Plus they keep my ears warm. If you like quality music and the way it sounds you will be blown away. At first I wasn't for sure about these cause I researched the reviews before I bought these cause I was searching for an inexpensive pair that was going to be the best. If your not careful these headphones might make you deaf if your not careful with the volume. I like loud and clear music and these is simply THE BEST....DONT HESITATE ON THESE HEADPHONES...ESPECIALLY FOR YOUR PC
1,terrible headset,"These headphones are very uncomfortable to wear, pressing at the ears if you wear them for too long. the microphone isnt very adjustable and mine broke in like 2 months"
1,Logitech Lies,"Not Mac compatible w/o preamp apparently. To simply state that this is Mac Compatible is disingenuous at best, and a blatant lie at worst. A cautionary explanation should be visible w/o opening the package. My retailer will not accept returns after opening, so I'm stuck. I want my money back Logitech!"
2,Poor Quality,"I purchased two pairs of these headphones for use on my computers. After a short time, on one pair, one side lost the sound, and in the other pair, I lost the microphone. So after only a couple of months, what was the value of these headsets? I usually like logitech, but I am greatly disappointed in this product. Now I will have to rethink buying any logitech product."
2,hurts ears to wear for long time -- better alternatives in price bracket,"This model has insufficient ear padding and it squeezes your ears too tightly. You can't wear this headset for more than 20 minutes before it becomes painful. If you're looking for a cheap, comfortable headset for gaming or talking on skype/voice-chat, I recommend this model for a similar price:Labtech 980232-0403 Stereo Headset with MicrophoneEven though this other model doesn't go over your ears, you're not really losing anything, since the logictech model doesn't really block out noise either."
2,It could be WAY better,"Bought these at the store and it ended up replacing my old microsoft headset. I liked it at first even though it did not fit my head very comfortably. The sound quality is great and I did not have any problems with the mic.The best thing about it is that the cable is ridiculously long, like about 2 meters. That is perfect for hooking it up to the TV while playing xbox and not disturbing anyone.Over time the sound quality declines and only one of the sides work unless you fiddle around with the plug or volume wheel. These fall off your head pretty easily so it is not really good for listening to music while your walking or moving around too much. It also gives me a headache on top of my head where the middle of the band is and I have to shift it around ocassionally.These overall are not that great, I don't like them or hate them, but it does the job. Putting them on for over 15 minutes or so and you'll feel like you want to puke."
1,"Would have been a great headset, but TechMia Ruined them.","Headset is rather large and heavy. Mic works well..But if you're going to purchase the low priced ones, don't. (Especially if ordering from TechMia.) First headset that was sent to me, only the right headphone worked, the mic worked as well. I contacted the sell, he quickly sent me a ""New"" headset as he said. Plus send me a full refund. Unfortunately it has been three to four weeks since TECHMIA said they would refund me, and still no refund. Anyways the next pair they sent me, both headphone worked, but the mic did not. So I played my games with the headset that had the mic around my neck, and the other over my head.Buy these new please, don't let the same thing happen to you as it did me.My friends over my voice programs said that the mic was great! which it was, and the headphones were nice, but really hurt my ears after an hour or two.Again - BEWARE OF TECHMIA."
3,Volume control ruined it,"Who on earth designed the volume controls for this thing? It's an almost-flush ""ring"" with a bump the size of a pinhead that rotates with amazing resistance. If you have the smallest bit of skin oil or moisture on your finger, you can't rotate the wheel. Your finger slips across it. Trying to press down on the ""bump"" makes the wheel immovable, and your finger slips again.I have two of these, and the slightest bend around the volume control wire connections causes drop-outs in audio. I can't seem to find one set of headphones that don't require bending of the cords to get 100% audio."
2,A great product at first...,"I bought this product in April because I liked the price and features it offered. Up until recently, it was working perfectly. The sound had been great and the microphone worked well. I also liked the volume control feature. Now, however, the right earphone sound is sometimes barely audible. The sound from it comes and goes. Now, I am hoping that I will not have to send it in to the manufacturer for a replacement. This is not acceptable for a practically new product."
3,Cheap and works well.,"I use them regularly. They are cheap, durable and good quality speaker and microphone but they are hurting my ear lobes if I use them for long time."
4,Good product with affordable price,"I use this product to fulfill my need of using online phone. I just need to connect it to my laptop using the available cables and ports and everything works great. It just simple like that. The main power of this product is the availability of microphone which is attached on the unit. The quality of the sound also comparable with others. Different product with the same capability will cost you more, but not for this one. This product is very good for you in term of the function and price."
3,Nice Headset,"This is a great headset, it looks good, and the sound is the best you can get for its price!It hurts my ears a little if i use it for too long, the head band is a little tight."
2,Logitech headsets,Sound is great. quality is great. The only problem is that it cannot be used for long at a stretch because ears start aching after sometime. The bar of the headset could have been adjustable.
2,Good audio but bad ear cushions,"Very good audio quality no doubt but the bad cushions (??) of the headset hurt your ears when you wear it. Even though the cushion feels soft to touch, just doesn't seem to help this problem at all."
2,only one side of the head set is working,"I has purchased this based on the Logitech Brand Value. Soon after the second day of use., Only One side of the head set is working and i totally upset."
4,Great headset for the price!,"Don't listen to the reviews that this headset is small, i'm a 24 yr old female and my ears are completely covered. Mic works great, sound is better than the one coming from my laptop speakers, the reason I gave this 4 stars is because it is not all that comfortable on the ears, it pushed your ears into your head a bit. But overall for the price, this is great and i love logitech."
1,Bad product,"This headset is one of the worst I've purchased in a long time. The sound quality is rather poor and everything sounded as if it was 10 feet underwater. I am normally a fan of logitech, my last two headsets and my PC audio system were all logitech products that I have been satisfied with. While I was using this product with ventrillo I got complaints that my headset was making a crackling noise while I was talking.End review, you get what you pay for. This headset is extremely cheap, so is the quality. Spring the extra few dollars and get a better product."
2,You get what you pay for,"I have a small head size but this headset hurts my ear and head just for 5 mins. For the mic, you can't bend next to your mouth and have to speak loud so others can hear you."
4,This head set is a must have.,My wife only wants this kind of head set because it isn't USB and it's so comfortable.
1,Uncomfortable Headphones and no Tech Support!,I just bought these on a whim at Best Buy for Rosetta Stone and Second Life. As soon as I put them on and found they were very uncomfortable to wear. After checking all my setting I can't get the microphone to work on my Macbook. I checked the website and they don't have anything on them anymore since I guess they are now an old model. I plan on returning them as soon as I can. Don't buy them!
2,Waste of money,"There is a malfunction with the volume control. Others here warned me about this and I should have listened. It needs to be always turned all the way up to actually hear the bass, and after some use it gets stuck. The microphone is low quality as well. The only pro is that it's pretty comfortable."
2,Not worth even this low price,"Pros: Cheap, + mic quality for chattingCons: It WILL break on you in months. I bought mine not 4 months ago and the left ear cup stopped transmitting audio.This headset logitech model, like other logitechs of its kind, have an annoying dongle in the first half of the cord to ""instantly control sound volume etc."" but what it really is is a nuisance. It gets caught on clothes and chairs with armrests and carries extra weight on the cord, tugging at the right ear (because this headset only has one cord connecting to the top).Other thoughts: get a better headset."
3,good head set. not for recording,"This is a good headset. comfortable and easy to use. But when I record with this and I move just so, I get a popping sound from the earpieces. fairly good audio quality. don't use for recording, but if you use for skype, its great."
1,Never again,"As with many others, I have been having problems with the headphones. The left speaker went out completely. Even if I do swivel with the chord, I can't hear continuous sound from the left speaker because it goes out so quickly. I recommend using earphones or other headphones and getting a better microphone. This mic is so close to your mouth, you often hear complaints about hearing your breathing. I'm never buying headsets like these again."
1,Worthless Junk,"These headphones are very uncomfortable to wear. The inline volume control never did work properly; it always got one side higher than the other. The supposed Noise-Canceling feature is a joke; it only cuts out constant sustained sounds of the same pitch, which means that the only thing they ever blocked out was the whistle on my tea kettle, which is the one thing I would prefer to not have blocked out. After about 4 months of only occasionally usage, one of the speakers stopped working altogether. Don't waste your money."
4,Nice headset,"The headset is very good. The headphones as well as mic are top notch...I make some very long distance calls(US - India) from my laptop and the mic works like a charm even for hours. Works even when the speaker is above my head. The mute-mic switch is also useful if you want to back bitch about the person you are talking to. Just kidding, but I highly recommend these. Its every bit worth the 20 bucks."
4,Great Product!,"I was so unsure about a product at this price, but since my purchase I am amazed at the sound quality and its ease of use. I highly recommend."
1,Bad Design = Discomfort/Pain and Problems,"Due to a poor design this headset causes discomfort, and eventually pain, when worn.Not to mention I've been recently experiencing problems with the left left speaker, which cuts off when the cord is jolted (to get it working again one must 'fiddle' with the cord around the ""controller"" then, once working again, handle gently).In conclusion, the bad design of this product causes not only problems, but discomfort and pain as well. My advice: spend a little bit more to ensure you get a better quality product.I am personally disappointed because I usually have a good experience with Logitech products."
4,Good until broke the mic,"During 5 month they works very good, the only problem is that you need to give it power with the windows options because if not the mic is very low.After 5 month the mic is dead."
4,logtech premium stereo haedset,The product is as advertised but don't buy this if you plan on listening to music at any volume over normal conversation level. It fitscomfotable delivers clear sound but only produces a moderate volume level
2,Ouch!,"Wow, these headphones are terribly uncomfortable!I've been using these headphones for a couple months now for both work and pleasure. They are very unpleasant to wear for more than a few minutes at a time. The cushions around the ears are minimal and they put a lot of pressure on the head.Sure, the sounds quality is great and they have a nice ""high-end"" look, but it's not worth it if you can't wear them. I would not recommend these to anyone."
2,Not terrible,"The sound quality, and voice output quality are good. However, I like the Logitech USB 350 much better. It is double the money, but the volumn, and mute button are much better. Also, for voice activation, the 350 is more relibale. While this unit will activate under normal voice if set up properly, a slight shake of the head will trigger it, not an issue with the 350. Spend the extra money on the 350."
5,Excellent for what I needed it for,"So, I bought a few of these in bulk from a local retailer, and for the price I paid, I got more than I expected. Each headset (so far) has lasted about a 10 months to 1 year before any noticeable defects arise, and when that does happen, I just move on to the next headset. I'm an intense gamer, so a headset lasting a year is extremely good for $20 a pop. I can only imagine how long they would last under less extreme circumstances. Extremely cheap for the duration and durability of the first year. This is the headset to get if you like high quality sound, low costs, and aren't afraid to replace a product."
4,Good value for what it does,"I bought this headphone to improve the quality of my skype calls. I used to talk directly to the laptop. While it's convenient, some people get annoyed because they think I am on a speaker phone. This headphone does a decent job in providing a regular phone like experience to the people I am calling. The only thing I don't like is the size. It's bigger than I expected, and feels kind of clumsy. But for $14 bucks, I can certainly live with it.Pros:- Good sound quality (for making internet calls)- Affordable (as far as headphone goes)Cons:- Large size"
4,good,the headphone and mike are good .. i founded the mike to be little away from the mouth and i had to speak a little louder or bring it closer ..the sound is good and clear and its cheap
4,Good Product,I purchased this after reading up on it. I'm into podcasting and wanted a headset mic. that had a good sound quality and ease of use. I'm pretty happy with this. I've been using it for a couple of months now and the quality of my cast is not too shabby.Granted you could get better quality from a Snowball Mic. or something along those lines for under $30 you won't do much better.
3,good but not the best...,"great bargain, i cant blv i got it for just 20$ when i got, even 2 years later it is showingList Price: $66.23Price: $50.99but in my order its still 19.99$. and its really great. it was a steal. yes the CD software i tried getting it online. i know though most recent new OS support plug and play there have been issues in certain laptops.this has helped me immensely in video chat and some really nice videos i've been able to take up, of a loved one who is not physically there with us today.thanks logitech! thanks amazon!this was abt the logitech camera"
2,Junk,"Bought two pair of these and neither set was able to come anywhere near a balanced output between left and right sides. On both units the right side was nearly twice as loud as the left, even when playing from a mono source. Beware."
1,Logitech overpackaged,I took several tools to try to open this %&#*%&* over packaged Logitech headset and in the process cut a wire that rendered the headset unusable. I did not take the additional time to return the ruined product and remain upset at Amazon and Logitech. I wasn't trying to steal this from a retail store...I bought it online and don't want to fight to open the product packaging.
2,Waste of money,"The microphone on this headset is junk. I could barely hear my voice when playing back recorded audio. The earphones are more audible, but they don't even match up to my cheap earbud headphones in terms of volume, depth or sound quality. This headset was only $13 when I bought it, so I wasn't expecting high end gear, but it wasn't worth it even at that price.To make matters worse, the third party vendor who sold the headset through Amazon (ANTonline) refused to let me return it because I ""damaged"" the packaging. Well, of course I damaged the packaging - there's no other way to open it! Like most headphones, these shipped in one of those plastic clamshell packs, which you can't open without ""damage"". Zero stars for ANTonline.I would have given the headset a lower rating, but it did *function*, it just did so very poorly."
5,Good Quality and Excellent Value,"This microphone was bought for use in voice acting, ours had broke and we needed a cheap temporary replacement. This microphone has exceeded all of our expectations! It is now our permanent mic for our projects. The mic has noise cancelling, so it really helps with background noise. Don't let the price fool you, a microphone about double this price was outpreformed by this mic in everyway"
4,Excellent product,"Product performs well and arrived in a timely manner. I suggest that some might try headset with a usb connection. If you have an old computer that has the headphone jack in the front and the mic jack in the back, do not buy this headset. It does not stretch far enough. It works fine on my laptop though."
3,Its worth buying...,This Headset is worthy enuf .....The speaker clarity is very good..n mike too works great..till date didnt have ne problem...the only problem is the headset ear plugs/buds are little hard ...if u wear it for long time ur ears starts to pain...
4,Decent headset for Price,"You get what you pay for, and you're getting what you pay for with this headset, which by the way only has a noise canceling microphone, not the headphones. Anyways, the padding on the phones isn't great, but it is fine for a couple of hours. While I wouldn't buy these exclusively for music listening, they do fine for talking to people or listening to music casually. For all of the people complaining about the microphone sound levels you need to look under your sound properties in the control panel, and under voice and the microphone control there is an 'advanced' tab which has a check box for a +20dB sound boost. I've been talking to my friend over the internet for a several days now without any problems, he can hear me fine.SO is this the best headset on the market? NO, but its a really great one for $13."
1,One word: Ouch,Wearing these for more than 30 minutes makes my ears hurt so bad I have to take them off.Sound and mic performance doesn't matter one bit if you can't wear the darn thing.
2,This product doesn't deliver.,"I ordered two sets of these and both have the same issues. I can only assume these aren't manufacturing defects, but are working as designed.These headphones have very poor audio quality--treble and bass frequencies are muffled. The package advertises that these are suitable for listening to music, but unless they were referring to AM radio, they couldn't be more wrong.The microphone barely picks up speech, regardless of positioning. You have to manually press the mic to get it near enough to your mouth to get any response, even with the recording volume and microphone boost on the sound card turned all the way up. I think the noise cancellation may be working too well. *note: I do not have this issue with other microphone headsets, so I can only assume that again, this is by design."
1,sorry,Just got it today.I should have listened to the reviews listed here. Very uncomfortable and my mic doesnt work. :(
2,Yeah......,DO NOT wear this thing for more than half an hour. It kills your ears. And the microphone doesn't work. The sound quality is the same as any headphones. Would not buy this product.
1,"Hurts my ears, Mic quality is bad","First of all let me say, you get what you pay for. It was a cheap headset and thats why I bought it.I have a small head but after 30 mintues i cant wear it, it hurts way too much. And had I read the reviews before ordering it, I would've never bought it but I decided to read after I bought it and felt the pain to make sure I wasnt the only one with this complain.People complain that they cant hear me well, the mic quality is really bad.Its not even worth my time to return it for what its worth.If you really hate someone, gift it to them. :)"
2,Poor quality. Really poor quality. Overal ok for the price,"I have seen the reviews on Amazon and it is the first time I ignore them. I said to myself - how bad can it be considering the fact that is a Logitech product. The first time I have touch the headset, I try to adjust it and I broke one side, the cable from the left speaker went out, the volume control doesn't work at the high setings, the ergonomics are realy bad, the cable is cheap. It is painful to keep them on your head. The good part it is that it looks ok, it sounds ok, the microphone is ok and after some time you no longer feel the pain. For the price they are ok as functionality, but realy realy bad in ergonomics and quality."
5,"Pretty Good All-Around Headset, Great for the Price","I got these about a month ago and use them for both VOIP and Flight Sim. The people on the other end say that they can hear me perfectly, and I hear them just as well. They also work well for music, but I usually use my iPod headphones for music. They are reasonably comfortable, but your ears do start to ache a little bit after four or five hours of use. Overall, these were a great buy, and I highly recommend them."
2,headphones,This is an 'ok' product. Sound quality is just fine. Cannot use it for long periods as the ears hurt because of the hard cushioning. It is ok to use with internet. I bought them bcoz of the price. For this price this is a good product.
1,Microphone did not work,The microphone did not work in the unit I was sent. I guess you get what you pay for...it is not worth the 12 dollars I spent to try and find a way to return these. Very frustrating.
1,Don't buy this.,"I bought this about 1 week ago and coulden't wait to rip it out from the box. I wanted to use this headset for games like World Of Warcraft and Skype, and when I plugged it into my Power Mac G4 Running 10.3.9, it appeared on the system preferences and started working very well. The sound quality was amazing, I thought it was very comfortable, and the headphones were awesome. I thought this product was great, so far.After about 30 minutes of using it, suddenly the mic and the headset stopped working. When I checked my system preferences, It coulden't find the device. I tried it on different USB ports, different computers, tried restarting the computer, and even disabled my sound card. I conclusion, unless you would only wear this headset as a fashion statement, I don't reccomend it."
1,Logitech Premium Stereo Headset with Noise-Canceling Microphone,"Ordered Logitech Premium Stereo Headset with Noise-Canceling Microphone on 01/26/2011, that's almost two months ago. Have not received the item, two query's and no response as of this time."
4,"Very Good; a bit too snug, though.","I'm very happy with the product, it has good sound quality, mic works great. However, after about 20 minutes you start feeling it is a bit too tight on your ears. Great if you're not planning to use it for long conversations. Overall, it is worth the price. Definitely would buy it again."
3,They are fine...but,"This headset works great, it does cancel out the noise around you so people can hear you speak clearly. The band and cups are comfortable if you wear them less than 8+hrs a day, if you wear glasses or have any piercings on the outer rims of your ears they do put pressure on your ears and will cause pain after awhile.I used these on a daily basis for about 9+hrs a day for work and online gaming. The volume and mic mute button started going out within 3 months and now I am having issues with the left speaker working.I've owned these for a total of 4.5 months.I think for general Team Speak use they work perfectly, just not for the long prolong daily use of a hard core gamer."
2,good enough for voip,"It is good to chat on skype for an hour. that's it.I would not recommend using it to listen to music, or wear itall the time."
2,Not very good,"Pros:1) volume and mic on/off controls2) sound is decentCons:1) uncomfortable - it presses on the ears in such a way that extended wear results in discomfort2) mic is too far from mouth - it can't pick up my voice sufficiently. When using it for VOIP, people at the other end can barely hear me."
2,Not as good as expected!,The sound is medium quality and after less than 5 minutes of use your ears will be like a toast - too hot that make the experience unconfortable
2,Uncomfortable - Poor Sound,"I really couldn't find these comfortable after having them on my head for about 10 or 15 minutes. Ear pieces are really hard and small and barley cover my already small ears.Also, Vista doesn't play well with 1/8th microphone jacks, at least on my Creative X-Fi sound card (didn't bother with my onboard audio) since I can't find these comfortable to even wear.Sound quality is ok. Decent bass but all mids with NO highs. Everything simply sounded flat.These are going back to the store I bought them from and I'm buying the Logitech USB desktop mic and stick with my expensive Sony Studio Monitor noise canceling headphones."
2,Worked fine until they....stopped working....,"I bought these for my mom to wear to use with her voice recognition software so that she wouldn't have to type manually because its a slow and painful process for her (Arthritis). These were working fine for 4 months, if a little uncomfortably, until one day she called me and asked me to come a fix her VR software for her.I spent an hour with the software on her computer and Windows trying to figure out why the microphone wouldn't receive what she was saying, until I tried the headphones on her radio and saw they didn't even receive sound.Unfortunately, my mom forgot if she had dropped or spilt something on them, but when I got there, there was no visual evidence of anything having happend to them. The radial volume and the microphone on/off switch both still move normally, and there is no physical damage to the cord or the jacks. I am miffed as to why these stopped working, but they were good while they lasted."
1,"Bought 2, one had mic DOA and the other broke in 3 months.","I've owned 2 pairs of this headset over the years.The first one that I got worked OK for about 3 months before the sound went out in the right side. Needing a cheap pair quick I saw these again and figured they'd work temporarily and even for that I was wrong.With the second pair I got the microphone was broke when I bought them and about 2 months later, like the first pair, the sound went out on the right side.Don't buy these, they're junk. I take good care of my headphones and these are a waste of money even at the cheap price."
2,Very flimsy,Very flimsy. One can work up quite a sweat with those badly designed earmuffs. The mike will come off with a few days of extensive use. I wouldn't recommend this item to my worst enemy.
3,My review.,"Ok, first off i bought this product for my PS3 and i than seen it wasn't a usb tip. so i then bought an adapter for like 5 bucks so a total of like 20 or 23 bucks. i was happy with the quality of the mic and the head phones. there pretty good. but i will say the head phone do have an shortage in them. i have to take the usb out and put it in quite a few times for both sides of the head set to work. but the mic never messes up. i would recommend the product."
2,"Good quality, VERY uncomfortable","I've used these for the past couple of months for Skype calls. They have great quality, but they hurt my head so much that I am purchasing a new headset to replace these."
2,"Good sound, bad in other areas","I purchased this item based on the Logitech brand which I trust. Sound from it is excellent, however wearing them for extended periods causes extreme discomfort on my ears that I have not experienced from other headsets. The dial to control the volume also appears to have developed a short, as all sound is lost when I try to change the volume and playing and mashing on the dial is required for some time to restore it. I am surprised at the poor quality as it was treated very well and owned for less than a year, but I would not reccomend this to anyone else."
3,Reasonable but not great,"I bought this item used at a great price, and the sound quality is excellent. However I have two gripes. 1) The Speaker pick-up is a little weak, and 2) the ear pieces bother my ears after 30 minutes or so of wearing them. This seems to be a pretty common complaint."
2,cheapo closures,"Keeps the rain off, but not in heavy wind. The closures are some cheapo plastic thingies that aren't quite snaps, and will jostle open easily. I bought this for use on my motor scooter, and I wish I'd bought something with a zipper instead. Packs up small."
4,Never Too Late for Love,"After three years with time and therapy Tiffany has a new lease on life. She has conquered her alcoholism and low self-image and helped her daughter and son move on. She decides to leave Atlanta and take a job in St. Louis, a job secured by Jason Cates, the father of her former. Jason is a physician who has been widowed for thirty years and is still rambling in the huge house he bought for his wife and has raised their five children in. Jason invites Tiffany to share his home until she settles into her new position and can secure housing. Jason cannot shake the strong attraction to this beautiful, composed woman, and it isn't long before she rocks his world. The book interwove characters from the two above mentioned books as well as The Look of Love, giving Ms. Jackson's fans an update of their lives."
1,SLANDEROUS,"THE MANS NAME IS ROLAND EMR AND NOT JON AND IS SLANDEROUS TO ALL THE JON EMRS IN THE US. ALSO, HE HAD A VALID CONTRACT WITH NBC AND FRIES ENTERTAINMENT THAT WAS NO CON AT ALL. AND SUGGS WAS NOT A BODYGUARD A FRIEND OF HIS GIRLFRIENDS GIRLFRIEND.ROD LURIE HAS BEEN SUED BEFORE AND WROTE SLANDER ABOUT CLINTON AS WELL. HE MAY WELL FIND HIMSELF BACK IN COURT AGAIN."
1,Rod's the fraud,"A serious disappointment. Not worth even the few dollars it costs to obtain a copy of this now out of print novel. The con game is Mr. Lurie attempting to cash in on the life of a valuable man who is no longer living and who's life ended in tragedy. He seems to attempt to convince the reader that the information told in the pathetic work of fiction comes from reliable sources, I think not. Who's the real fraud?"
4,"Awesome game, but the glitch is a *","This is a great game, but the glitch is annoying! It tends to freeze up while in the Danger room and while changing characters. So save often!!!!!!!! I first wrote that it was the Xbox version that had the glitch, but I found out that it happens on all platforms. I also found out that if you keep your inventory low (Hero and item stash) then you can minimize the freeze-ups. (The key word here is minimize, it will still freeze.) Also, it's good to keep a back up saved game, just alternate saves. This way you won't get stuck losing hours of game play like I did. I was just starting Act 5 (the last act) when my game wouldn't load... and I had to start over... not happy. So save yourself some time and frustration by following this advice."
2,ehh,The graphics look like they are from Playstation 1. The combat system amounts to a whole lot of button mashing. The camera angles are really annoying. For some ridiculous reason the game designers thought they needed to show you where all the enemies are just before you get to them.
1,Microsoft does it again!,"Microsoft strikes again! Amazon had this game for $20 cheaper for X-Box than PS2... so I bought the X-Box version. What idiot wouldn't? Well as it turns out I'm the idiot! Microsoft has struck again, as this game is NOT and I repeat NOT supported on X-Box 360, which is probably why it's so much cheaper than the PS2 version on this fine site. My 360 informed me to check Microsoft's site for an update list of playable X-Box games... which hasn't been updated since November 2007.Bill Gates... you owe me $8."
4,It's An Overall Good Game,"I Like This Game More Than The First Cause There Are More Characters In It, Throughout The Game From The Playable Characters, The Bosses, And The Cameo Characters. Besides, Some Of My Favorite Marvel Characters Are On This Game (Juggernaut, Omega Red, Sugar Man, Stryfe, Mister Sinister)There's Nothing Really Wrong With This Game Besides When You Beat It You Might Not Wanna Play It No More (lol) Just Play With 3 Other People It'll Bring It Back"
3,Fun but a bit repetitive,"This game is fun for its multiplayer, but it gets a bit repetitive and the superpowers are powerful enough it seems."
3,good singing with adequate conducting,"There is plenty to enjoy on this live radio broadcast of Lucia for one thing Pavarotti who whilst sounding tentative in places still gives a beautifully sung account of Edgardo,fresh if occasionally strident,Scotto has such a vocally dramatic voice you can easily picture her decline into madness,she can however sound too forceful in places with some wild singing in evidence but it is nevertheless very exciting,Cappuccilli seems to relish playing the heartless brother aptly characterising the role of Enrico,there are the traditional cuts and Molinary Pradelli is only adequate in conducting this opera."
3,"Alright, but...","""But"" seems like the word I can most easily apply to this recording. Renata Scotto is good,BUT in dramatic intensity she cannot beat Callas, and her high notes leave a lot to be desirable. For example, the penultimate note of ""Quando, rapito"" seems to be emitted by some bizarre breed of goat. She does produce some nice sounds, though. Pavarotti is thrilling,BUT he sounds uncertain, like he's only studied the score for five minutes before the broadcast. Cappuccilli is a passable Enrico,BUT the role seems to be just out of the range of his capabilities, his voice is a little scratchy in timbre and rough on his higher notes. The rest of the cast is alright,BUT the Arturo is a pretty weak bit of casting, Alisa is a bit plummy, and Raimondo a bit plodding.There is nothing good I can say about Molinari-Pradelli's conducting - he has absolutely no control over his orchestra or singers.A set not worth going out of your way for particularly."
3,Kind of Hit or Miss with this one,"While we do have one jack in the house that works well, this one's crackly and doesn't work as well. Have no idea why, but I guess it's a bit of hit or miss with the unit. In theory this is a great solution, when the units work & we're thankful one does."
2,"Little knowledge, and little focus.","The video looks great: beautiful photography, etc. But I was disappointed by the lack of information. Aside from seeing the animals, you learn next to nothing about them, besides what they are. None of the usual barage of information and factoids you expect from educational videos. Furthermore, only about one third of the video has anything to do with penguins. The other two thirds is about other animals, such as seals, whales, and other birds. I got the video to learn and see penguins, and I was rather dissapointed by the lack of focus on them. And as I said before, there's little information about them, I learned more from books I read in grade school...."
4,Nice Convenience kitchen tool,"Pro: Very convenience. Wall mounted (slim) and cordless so no more going to the pentry, getting out small vac, uncoiling the wire, and then repeating all those steps in reverse after clean up. Enough power for small jobs around the kitchen counter top (ground coffee, bread crums...etc)Con: A little too weak for job beyond what mentioned above. Probably not strong enough to clean your car seat or sofa (I haven't try). Also, as the vac sucks air and dirt up, it blows air out to the side (left and right) so it may blow the very dirt that you are trying clean up all over. I have learned to adjust my moves after the first use.It is a good addition to the kitchen. It does a decent job for what it was designed for. Good quality for its price."
4,good enough,"I bought this product because I had a $20 gift cert from Amazon, so I payed just a few dollars for it. It does work, does the job on tile and thick carpet,overall happy with this purchase. It is pretty noisy though for a hand vac."
3,Discharges in one single use.,"1) DIscharges completely in one single use in the car.2) Not powerful enough to pick up particles like, a thread that in lying on the mat. Probably bcos, the thread 'sticks' a little more to car mat than a small rock does. Picks up small rocks and other particles perfectly though.3) Should have had more narrower 'nose'. It is not reaching the space between driver's seat base and the door frame.But for the price it is avlbl on Amazon, I do not mind living with above small flaws."
1,Failed.,"A few weeks ago I bought another Acu-Rite wireless temperature sensor at Walmart. I returned it without even installing it because it wouldn't work even in my living room: at 20 feet, line of sight, it would lose contact and have to be reset through a pin hole in the back.Yesterday I bought 2 Acu-Rite thermometers with wired sensors at Lowes. One has failed already - no wonder Lowes has them on clearance. Lowes, Walmart and Amazon need to keep track of the quality of what they sell.Lowes has Oregon Scientific wireless thermometers on sale - I can guess why."
2,I have the old model.,"I have the old model that I'm guessing this one took over. The only thing I like about it is the indoor and outdoor temperature and humidity display. The outdoor sensor's signal sometimes gets lost in space though as the indoor's display for the outdoor temp and humidity goes blank. The outdoor sensor's display still displays the temp and humidity though. The Atomic Clock must have been hit by a virus as the month, day, year, and clock are never right anymore once the signal is recieved. This was only right for about six months. The forecast is cloudy... always. Please read other reviews about other Acu-Rite weather stations before purchasing as I've seen similar problems from other owners."
2,Wireless Weather Station,I found the functions easy to use but I placed the remote station 15' from the weather station and it doesn't work. Unfortunately it's useless to me now.
1,Wireless doesn't work at 20 feet,"I did some research and this seemed like the devise for me in my office - a nice clock & weather station. The atomic clock doesn't recieve a signal and the outdoor wireless sensor doesn't connect to the device. I have the unit sitting on my window ledge approximately 20 feet (unobstructed view) to the wireless sensor. Besides the window and screen, there is nothing in the way. There is no electronic interference in the area and the device is calibrated (i.e., it will connect when the wireless sensor is in the same room). 100 feet - forget it - not even 20 feet. What's the point of a weather station that can't tell me the weather? Lousy."

2,"Light weight, nothing special","I'm sure that they are made of 18/10 stainless steel, but they didn't use very much of it. They feel very light weight, with no real heft. Like a fancier version of the flatware put out at an inexpensive family restaurant. The edges are sharp, and not rounded at all. The ""mouth feel"" of the spoons is a bit too sharp on the lips. I expected the knives to have a hollow handle, which was fine. The is no seam between the blade and the handle, and that part is nicely finished. The knives have a decent cutting edge, that can actually be used to cut most foods, although perhaps not steak. The set is shiny enough. It's a simple style which is what I was looking for. But they feel cheap. And indeed can be had for $[...] cheaper elsewhere (e.g. [...])."
4,Wallace Continental Classic Stainless Flatware Set,Very good quality. Holds up well in the dishwasher. A little on the large side but acceptable.
1,Feels cheap,These flatwares are not heavy at all. The butter knife handle feels hollowed out when you pick it up. Large utenils. You really would have to open wide for the spoon to fit and wider if there were actually food on it. Not worth for that price. Can get some that feels more expensive for a lesser price and did.
5,Great women's jacket,"I bought this jacket for my wife and she loves it.It seems like it runs a little tight if you plan on wearing additional clothing like sweat-shirts. It looks good, very functional and at a great price at approximately $70. Now my wife can look good and quit taking my warm jackets."
3,Offers Good Protection; Design Disappointing,"I bought the Visor Edge metallic case with the intention of protecting my investment. It does just that with its hard outer casing. However, what falls short is the design of the case. Although it ""looks"" really cool from a picture standpoint, the case has a ""cheap"" feel to it as the inside is made of plastic. I also find it difficult to slide the Visor Edge in and out of the case, and you cannot place the Edge in the cradle without taking it out of the case first. I'm sticking with the flip cover for now until I start traveling. Definitely not worth the retail price...."
3,"good protection, poor design","not being able to charge or sync my edge in the case...5 slides out of the case and already there is visible wear on the little nubs that hold it in place...i feel as if handspring did the unable to sync feature as a ploy to get us to buy a cable in addition to the cradle so you can sync your edge as well as charge it...so looks like im ordering a cable now, or just a second case which i fear will wear out soon anyway..."
5,yet another romantic masterpeice,this book shows that you can still count on the Harlequin name when you want a good romance novel. Plus the cover guy is a stud.
3,"All right, but not what I'd hoped for","While there's no doubt that Shy Girl is well-written and, at times, compelling, ultimately I was disappointed. I found the character of Alta an annoying caricature of an SF butch, and the gratuitous sex scenes and references to the dyke S/M scene distracting and contrived. I do think the portrait sketched of Shy is a profound one, though, and I also liked the way Stark conveyed the horrors of the Holocaust, relaying emotion without being either cliched or overly Spielberg-esque; I wish she'd started with the exploration of this theme earlier in the novel, along with gradually disclosing more information about Alta's mother. This book has a lot of potential, but I felt that its zenith was never reached, as is the case with too much contemporary lesbian fiction."
5,Read Shy Girl -- not the reviews! Save the mystery!,"Elizabeth Stark's novel is a fast read that is compelling and beautifully written. Hang onto the mystery -- and see how much we are alike -- and how our differences still are more accentuated and divisive than honored! The context of this novel is a MUST for the message. The author pulls the reader in -- and holds on! If you can't read this -- ask yourself why not and then finish it for the answer! Most of all, don't read the reviews (like the ones printed above!) that give the mystery away. You'll love it anyway, but will miss the ironic twist that Stark so eloquently delivers."
2,Full of promises but no flowers.,"I generally don't read chick books but was interested in this one. I read the first chapter and was impressed by the writing style and kept reading. Unfortunately, it was like eating cotton candy: it tastes good but you are not filled when you finish it. The pleasure in reading the book does not carry to the plot, characters, or message Shy Girl was trying to convey. Erotically, this book rate about 3 stars and those who share the characters lifestyles will enjoy the sensuality. The only drag is that Alta's love for Sasha (Shy Girl) didn't ring true for me. What could have been an excellent story about a gay woman being in love with bisexual or straight friend was overlooked. Unrequitted love of an out lesbian for a girl who might have tried it, liked it, and then lost interest in it, is more of an interesting story and given the resentment that lesbians/gays have for bisexuals or women who are in straight relationships, would have held my interest."
2,"It's really ""fascinating"" if you're not queer.","Fine example of trying to make a buck and a name in the mainstream lit world off the voyeuristic ""glamor"" of our little subculture/s. It was embarassing to read. But a simply *fascinating* slice of life if you're a mainstream yuppie."
5,Bonnie RN,"Well written, with humour and compassion. I work on a Medical unit and Step-Down Unit, in a downtown Toronto Hospital (across from the writers') and can strongly relate to her experiences.Excellent read - she voices very well so much that I have felt and seen in my own experience."
4,A Nurse's Story,This is a very insightful look into the life of a nurse. It provokes discussion about dignity vs. technology and what people really expect of hospitals and medicine.
4,Debbie in IL,"Really good book. Shows the ""human side of nursing"" If you or someone you love has spent any time in the hospital, this isn't ER!!! Doctors may get all the kudos, but it is the nurses who do everything. Thanks for a great book!"
2,Harps too much,"As a nurse, I have some understanding of this nurse's concerns and tribulations because I share them. To someone who is not a nurse, or who doesn't work with critically ill patients, this book may have a lot of informational value - however, being familiar with the setting, I found it more repetitive than anything else. I think I was hoping to gain more positive insights and to be introduced to some kind of unique perspective. For me, the book fell short."
5,awesome!!!! A++++++,"I read every word of this marvelous book. As a retired nurse I enjoyed her aspects toward nursing and her characters are very real. The situations also were very believable. The life of a nurse is very much as she depicted in her book. I reveled in every word and could barely put it down, except when absolutely necessary. The story lines were so true to life, some of which I experienced in my practice. I worked in the NICU so faced many of her situations. I am very proud to be called a nurse and anyone in the field should read this book. I highly recommend it to anyone."
1,Don't buy it if you have an iPod!,"When I insert this CD into my Mac, I get a message that it cannot be played. I have an old CD player that it played on ok. So, it looks like they have some kind of copy protection or the region encoding is incorrect."
5,I'm ready to move to Maine,"A very brief journal of Dow's first wedding anniversary in 1932 as she and her husband take a trip to a remote lake in upstate Maine. Her sheer joy and appreciatation for the quiet, natural world around her make this a delightful read. She uses all her senses to describe the wilderness around her, and have no doubt, you will want to be at that lake immediately to experience the same beauty she witnesses. A wonderful book."
1,"Another religious person hates atheists, news at 11","Religious people, who claim to be so loving and caring, certainly spend a great deal of time expressing their hatred of atheists. Why bother to read this book ? If you already hate atheists, then the author is merely ""preaching to the choir"". If you don't hate atheists, this book will not enlighten you because it's full of misinformation. Save your $$, and buy something worthwhile like a great novel or a science book."
5,"A logical responce to the ""Death of God""","Dr. Zacharias has laid out in this book the logical consequences of a death of God. If God is out of the equation what basis does humanity have for morals, for meaning, or even love? Zacharias delves into these, and other questions dealing with atheism.In respnce to other reviews, yes Zacharias has met and delved into deep philisophical quesitons with atheists. He recants many instances in the book. In addition, he used to be an atheist, who after setting out to explore these quesitons himself ended up refuting athiesm and embracing theism."
1,A Shameless Lie,"This work is perhaps the most outrageous load of manure I'veever come across. Zacharias does little more than substitute vitriol and unsupported assertion for arguement. He blames atheism for everything from the Holocaust to contermporary troubles in Centeral America and almost never bothers to bring even the smallest shred of evidence into his absurd rant. An excellent review of the work was written by my friend Doug Krueger. Since another reader has called attention to a rebuttal of Krueger's review, in the interest of fairness I would like to point out Krueger's response to that rebuttal. It can be found on the Secular Web..."
1,An unsuccessful attempt to refute or discredit atheism,"Ravi Zacharias's _A Shattered Visage: The Real Face of Atheism_ is an unsuccessful attempt to refute or discredit atheism. He concentrates on some of the more prounounced problems with atheism, as he perceives them, and at http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/doug_krueger/colossal.html I show why some of his approaches fail. I say 'some' because I will address only the most salient errors. A thorough refutation of all of the mistakes in his 200-page book would require another 300 pages or more, as these sorts of things are short in the telling and long in the refuting.Doug Krueger"
1,A work of fiction,"It is disheartening to admit that any reader could consider this work a serious thesis. As a baptized Catholic, I must say the pat 5-star reviews presented are conceivable only as a vote of emotional complicity. (Notice that the atheists attempt to comment substantively.)The book is execrable. It advances not by logic but by assertion and propaganda. I've not felt so vicariously disgraced since reading the apologist works of David Noebel. I would caution any believer against employing in debate any one of Zacharias' ""lines-of-reason"". Don't embarrass yourself.Remember, if the atheist didn't have an excellent case, the issue would be ""fact"" not faith. Read the caliber of Chesterton if you hope to answer for your belief persuasively."
5,The Best Violin Works by Tchaikovsky available,"Middle of the road, Hardly. I feel this version has the proper musicality needed for Tchai.s VC. Much like Szeryng's version, and unlike the hurried Heifetz version, Kaler provides us with the right combination of the aforementioned. Szeryng is a favorite of mine, but his version is on a double CD best of Tcahi. Heifetz's is a shorted version and is at a quicker tempo, and is not my one of choice. Heifetz's quicker bow speed results in non-special moments. If there is one thing this version has over others it's musicality. The other aspect of this CD which made me purchase it was the other great violin pieces. The Op. 26, Op. 42, & Op. 34 are all performed very well and showcase Tchaikovsky's great violin writing ability. If you want Tchaikovsky with feeling and emotion, this is it."

5,Beached Down Under,"I fell in love with the Solomons during two visits in the mid-1980s. Will Randall has captured the spirit of the islands very well.... the casualness of the process, the friendships of the locals, the dubious expats who drift in and out.You will enjoy his British wit and laugh at his adventures and fellow islanders. A great holiday read, especially if in the tropics."

3,For older RC systems only,"Please note that this is a 4 wire servo, not compatible with most RC products.The servo also has an odd hexagon connection to the servo saver so it cannot be used with a standard micro servo.I am sure there are older Team Losi products this is meant for, my fault for not looking closely at this product"
3,BUYER BEWARE!,"The table I received had been very obviously patched on top in two places, plus other parts of the table had warped melamine surfaces and defective construction. As for the table set itself, it is a great table, very compact for storage and folds out to a very nice size. Plus, it rolls very easily to move it from room to room. Basically, watch out for this seller, you might end up with a refurbished item."
4,DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL DO.,"PRODUCT DOES REDUCE ALLERGENS AND LEAVES A FRESH SMELL, I DON'T SNEEZE AND WHEEZE AS MUCH WHEN I LAY ON MY BED PILLOWS. I AM ALSO ALLERGIC TO MY CAT, WHOM I AM SURE, WALKS ON MY BED WHEN I'M NOT HOME."
3,Should have bought something else,"There's nothing really wrong with this watch. It looks good and is lightweight. But frankly I wish I would have bought something else. It is too thick to fit nicely under a normal shirt sleeve, the surface gets dirty easily, and the straps stay curved even when you take the watch off of your wrist."
2,"it was nice, but wasent what i orderd","i Orderd it Black like in the photo, but i got a Grey Watch, i didnt really like it...but thanks anyways..."
1,i received it with a dead battery,I can't really put in an objective review because i received it with dead battery. I returned it after i got it. I din't really had a hard time returning it but i think it was a waste of tiime. I would've kept it if it was working.
2,Scratches!,"This is an alright watch, however the screen was scratched two minutes after I opened it!"
1,Waste Of Money,Waste of Money Don't buy this . I expected a lot from Amazon as well as from Casio. Great disappointment.
5,Casio Men's Ana-Digi Electro-Luminescent Sport Watch,"I really enjoy this watch. It has all the features I need on a regular basis and none of the fluff that I could do without. It is very attractive and easy to read in all lighting conditions and the backlight is sufficent to illuminate the display at night. The only negative (and it's a minor one) is that you have to set the analog and digital times separately. The analog hands can only be advanced so setting them back an hour requires you going forward 11 hours. Not a huge issue as this is not done often unless you travel a lot. Just something to consider. It is a very nice everyday watch, not meant for dressy occasions. Excellent watch for the price."
4,"good product, good price","I haven't had the watch for long but the watch has a nice design, looks sturdy and excellent quality priced. The only downside is that as much as the black background looks nice it's kinda hard to see the digital time unless you look at it at a specific angle. The time is not as bright as on the image. But apart from that I am happy with my purchase."
4,Great watch!,"Pros: Inexpensive, lightweight, durable, water resistant, looks good, has many features (including several alarms), works well. I got it for my boyfriend to use as both a work watch and an alarm clock. Cons: I take one star away because figuring out how to set/use/program it is kind of complicated. You actually have to read the instructions, which some people (like me) hate to have to do. Other than that, this was a perfect watch for my boyfriend. He has about eight nice (and expensive looking) watches, and he often ends up wearing this one more than the others, even on his days off. The analog and digital features combined on this watch make it a very cool, modern and stylish looking watch."
3,Casio Men's Ana-Digi Electro-Luminescent Watch #AQ160W-1BV,"Great watch, but still not able to set the chronograph time, though you can chk ur time from the digital one."
2,too small..,very good item meet the especifications .. is being used and it works properly . very good . v e
4,"Love the form factor and functionality, durability questionable, still a good value.","Very happy with the look of this watch and functionality surpasses my needs and is a decent value. Still, I would pay more for this watch with a more durable crystal. Also, buttons sometimes push themselves too easily in normal range of motion. As others have pointed out, stem is plastic, but I regularly wear mine in a very hostile work setting and aside from some scratches on the crystal (which may or may not be correctable with buffing) the watch has held up nicely. Worth noting that the accelerometer light functionality was an outstanding surprise feature -- great for those who work nights and/or in dark environments. Still some room for improvement (stem, buttons) but overall this is a nice watch that wears well."
2,OK for my purpose,Got it only for sailing on my boat. First day using it I scratched the crystal. I can easily read the dials when I cannot sometimes read the digital but it is an OK watch for a work watch.skratch98
3,"Decent, but...","It was a decent Casio watch with a very nice style though the face is plastic and could get scratched pretty easily if not taken care of. The wrist of the watch is very fragile and it broke when i flexed my wrist too much, of course you can't expect much from a watch that's less than 30$. Overall if you are careful with it it could last an year or so but the quality isn't great."
2,Casio watch,"This watch keeps good time, but was very complicated to get it setup for my time zone. Occasionally I noticed it had been accidentally switched to another time zone, requiring me to reset it without the benefit of the instruction booklet.The crystal is not glass but plastic and scratches easily."
3,shipped pretty fast,"From the moment I open up the box I already fall in love with this watch, the watch shipped to me in 4 days time and am in Thailand, pretty fast. Everything is working perfectly no scratches, But the only problem is cleaning cloth is not packed inside."
3,"all the fetures i want in a watch, in the cheapest pakage.","I wanted a watch with analog and digital interface. so found this witch looks great, the digital clock has big and clear numbers. the auto light function is so cool. it has 4 alarms, world time and other Casio features.the only thing i hate about this watch is build quality. my jacket scratched it on my first week. the screen is made from plastic and it catches every scratch. you can even scratch it with your finger nails if you want. not just the screen, every thing else is also cheap. after few months of everyday usage you will need to change it. bad bad bad please Casio keep the same design but make it better. add a glass screen, change the plastic case with something better. i will be willing to pay an extra 100 bucks for a quality similar to sieko or pulsar."
2,Crystal scratches too easily...,"The watch is functional and nice looking, however, I found that crystal to be slightly higher than the watch face causing it to scratch much too easily. I am very disappointed as I like the look. If you work, meaning real work, don't buy this watch...you will scratch it!"
4,good but not for agreesive activities,Easy to read display. Large digital numbers. The only complaint I have is the crystal surface marks up too easily.
4,Good watch for the money,"This is a good watch for the money. It's lightweight and looks great on my wrist. The only thing, the watch band is a little too tight. They could've made it a little longer. Other than that I'm happy with it."
1,Badly designed band anchor,"This is a beatifully designed watch and a steal for what they charge. But as a significant number of reviewers noted, the flimsy plastic band anchor breaks off too easily(not covered by warranty). I use this type of watch only for vacations, water sports, etc. and used this one for just a few times over a 6-month period. I now have 3 different Casio watch bodies in a drawer (all working perfectly but with no band attached). This is my last one. I don't understand why they can't charge a few more dollars for a similar watch with a metal attachment to the body."
1,It lasted about two weeks.,"The reason is a broken band anchor, as also mentioned in a previous review. It happened while I was taking the watch off. The plastic on the watch that holds the anchor pin broke away. I don't think that the pressure I exerted that caused this was that extreme. I believe that the quality of the plastic wasn't good enough for normal use. I do not recommend it."
4,Great all purpose watch,"I paid $27.50 for this with free shipping. I was suprised at how easy it is to use all the functions. Watch looks nice. It is lightweight. Trim around bezel area in picture appears grey, but it is really a chrome color/look which in my opinion is much better. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the digital time is very dim unless light reflects off it just right. On the other hand, the illumination works great to light it up!"
4,Little bit Dressy--Little Bit Functional,"I love digital watches, but they always look a little geeky or like I'm getting ready for jogging. This watch gives me a general time with the analog hands and if I need to be exact..the digital can be read with a little more effort.Watch band is a little short, (or my wrists are a little fat)..I can get on but it's right at the last hole.Also, it's a great price, perfect for 2nd watch when you don't want to look too nerdy or too sporty."
2,Nice but poor quality,I like the watch but the crystal scratches too easily and thre programming is inconsistent. I think Casio could have beefed up the crystal since it is billed as a sport watch.Amazon verified purchase for what its worth
1,cheap band material,"The band is just cracking (extreme gentle use since april 2010) not even a year, and I feel i will have to throw away this watch... although it still works perfectly and no scratches on the main part"
5,Casio Sport watch,This watch was a present for my son. He loves it! He loves playing with the various functions. The only problem is that we're having problems with changing the analog part of the watch. We couldn't find anything in the instructions to help us. He's always on time now since the alarms let him know when it's time to get home. I would recommend this watch.
2,Not all that great,"In my opinion, it is hard to operate. Analog hands must be set independently from time on watch. You cannot run the hands backwards, so you potentially have to hold the button down for several minutes to get to where you need to be.Much bulkier than it appears."
4,Analog and Digital,I've worn this watch for a few weeks now and I really like the analog and digital face. My only complaint is that the watch body is fairly thick. Otherwise it is a very good value. I would definitely purchase it again.
2,Casio Sport Watch #AQ160W-1BV,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GB0FYO/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleWatch band is very cheaply made and very short for the average man. You may want to find a replacement band if your wrist is wider. I've been buying Casio watches for about 20 years and since then the quality of these watches have dropped considerably. The dial for this watch runs deep, that is if you desire fat watches you may like this one. The luminescence is also weak. The price is fair for the quality of this watch, running about $25. I returned this and bought the Casio G-Shock for men, a much better buy for $44. Thank you."
5,Cool Watch,I bought this watch and I like it alot. I have 2 different time zones set on this watch and works great and easy to set up.
3,Good watch - great price!,"I needed an inexpensive, water resistant, easy to use watch. I didn't want it to be bulky, and I wanted it to be stylish. This one fits the bill.Pros:- Inexpensive- Water resistant- Thin & lightweight (extremely comfortable)- Decent night viewing light- Digital & analog- StylishCons:- bezel plastic scratches easily- Non intuitive set-up- Short time span of analog hands luminosity"
5,My favorite watch - crystal scratch removal trick,"I have had this watch for almost a year, it is my all time favorite for looks and function in an inexpensive watch. I like the resin band better than Casio's metal, it pinches. The crystal scratches easily. I am very rough on watches and scratch the crystal weekly, but since this crystal is not too hard it is very easy to remove the scratches with toothpaste...just rub it on the scratch with your finger and it is good as new."
2,"Great looks, poor design","The watch's functions and look are fantastic. However, as some have warned here too, the black plastic that holds the wrist-band pin is weak. It breaks easily and you cannot fix it. Casio needs to redesign this watch to have metal hold the wrist band pin."
1,Ran fast before it died.,"I had this watch for just over a year before it failed on me and stopped working (53 weeks to be exact, just out of warranty). I believe it failed because the water seal failed as it stopped while I was swimming and there was moisture inside the glass. I had swam with it many times before so this was a surprise.I liked the hands that were readable at night as well as the snooze alarm. The face of the watch scratched way too easily however, and that made it difficult to read the numbers sometimes. The watch gained time so that at the end of each month I'd be five minutes fast. The fact that analog hands were set separately from the digital time (and could only be set by going forward) made it hard to keep analog and digital times in sync and correct.I think I'm going to look for something with a more scratch resistant face."
3,"Nice watch, short wristband - not for men, maybe for teenagers.","Measure your wrist, if it's 8 inches around, the band will be too short. My wrist is 7"" and I think it's a bit tight even so.I like the watch, I wear it every day. The only complaint I have is the band, which is too narrow and too short to qualify it as a ""Men's watch""."
4,Great Watch,I have been wearing Casios since 1980 when I was 4! I have had Casio Digital Watches ever since. This is the first Casio that I have ever been complimented on. It is conservative enough that I can wear it to work with suits and not have it look out of place.My complaint is that the dials can only move forwards and not backwards. Which makes adjusting back one hour for Daylight Savings a real hassle.It is only slightly more expensive then the usual cheap Casios but it looks alot nicer.
5,It's what I wanted.,"I was looking for an accurate timepiece that would offer good nighttime visibility, and analog hands. It's very functional and good quality. Luminescent hands (or whatever the glow-in-the-dark stuff is). Backlit digital display.Stylish? Not sure, but I've certainly seen uglier watches."
2,Honest,"I got the watch fast with amazon Prime. It came neatly packaged.Upon opening it there are several things you will notice. For one, the watch is a lot darker than it appears in the photo. It is very hard to see either the hands of the watch or the digitial display. you can hit a button which luights it up but it lasts a whole 3 seconds.Second, the watch is a lot smaller than I'd imagined. The size is given online so this is probably fault of my own, but it seems rather small.Third, the band seems very low quality and is smaller than other rubber bands i have seen. The clasp seems very cheap almost like a cheap plastic and the band feels fragile and inadequate.The fit on my wrist was less than appealing. Overall the watch is not bad its the band which makes it get a low rating. If you dont mind a dark watch with a small band the price cant be beat. Otherwise do some research and buy a slightly better watch."
3,Not the best Casio watch I've ever had.,"I needed a basic watch for quick switching to multiple time zones while traveling overseas. This one does the job well with very simple one-button functionality. The band is cheap plastic. The back-light is the worst I've seen from all the Casio watches I've owned. Not only is it weak, it stays on for less than 2 seconds, even if I hold down the light button. [BTW, best backlights can be found in Timex's Expedition watches. Better than some expensive brands.]Pros:-Light weight. Good for wearing for longer periods of time.-Best feature is ease of use.-Easy one-button switching to different modes.Cons:-Band is plastic.-Back-lighting is very weak.-Back-lighting is way too quick."
1,Junk,"Like some other reviewers, the pin holding on the strap broke the watch casing after about 3 wearings. Apparently a defective moulding, so luck of the draw if it will happen to you. Straps are easy to replace, but the case itself is not covered under the warranty. My next ""cheap"" watch will have a metal case, and this is my last Casio!The watch itself wasn't bad - I liked the accelerometer feature where if you tip your wrist to view the watch, it would automatically illuminate. Oh well."
3,"good watch, but...","i like this watch a lot, with all it's features. however, the face is easily scratched and the body is thicker than i was used to."
5,funky n decent at the same time!,"Looking at the photos of the watch I was having second thoughts when ordering it. Finally decided to buy that e1 if I happen to not like it too much, the price is worth taking a chance. Delivered bang on time, I was really happy with the look and feel as soon as I opened the package. Time setting was not an issue, could do it even without looking at the instructions booklet.This watch looks a little big in snaps but looks pretty decent when on wrist. Dual time is really handy thing to have. Seconds indicator is funky.There was only one problem- went to see off a friend to the airport and saw that he had forgotten to wear his. So had lent it to him. Now he refuses to give it back :))I think I'll have to buy one more.......!"
3,a decent beater watch,"i purchased this b/c of all the glowing reviews, and its fine for my purpose which is for the gym and hiking and generally abusing it a bit, plus i wanted digital and lightweight. it is indeed these. the two downsides i found are that the digital numbers are not as bright or bold as other watches ive seen, and the face of this watch is plastic, and mine in just a couple months has already formed these odd permanent spots like water-spots all over it. for the price though, its fine."
1,Poor construction - you get what you pay for (or maybe even less),"I purchased this watch in July '09. I wore it for 1 week and then one day it simply fell off my wrist. The point on the watch casing where the pin holding the wristband is inserted had snapped off. It appears that the hole for the pin had weakened the structural integrity of the watch casing at this point. Mind you, I'm not wearing this watch on a construction site or exposing it to any undue abuse or stress - I'm sitting in front of a computer most of the day. Anyway, I sent the broken watch off to Casio for repair, figuring it must be under warranty. Unfortunately the repair estimate came back from Casio for $46.00 - the watch casing is NOT covered under the warranty. My week-old watch had cost me $29.99 on Amazon, so it'd be cheaper to buy a new one, which I will NOT do, after this experience."
1,Casio Warranty Repairs,"I purchased the AQ160W-1BV as my first Casio to see how the watched performed. I really liked the features and look but after 6 months I noticed one of the buttons was missing. I guessed it would not be problem so I returned the watch with the receipt, but was informed the Warranty only covered the watch works and the buttons are considered part of the case. For only $40 they would be happy to fix the watch and send it back. This was my first and LAST Casio!Timex would fix any watch I have ever owned without questions so I will purchase a replacement from Timex. I am only glad the Casio was inexpensive so the loss was a learning experience that I will make sure everyone understands."
4,gift for husband,"I bought this watch for my husband as a casual watch since he just lost his old one. I thought the price was reasonable and it got a lot of good reviews. When i received it, I was rather impressed by the quality and the features of this watch. My husband liked it a lot too. The plastic band is very slim so it feels comfortable. It is easy to read in direct sunlight and in low light conditions. and most importantly, it keeps very accurate time. I have no doubt about its durability since it is a Casio and they are known for long lifetime."
2,Many function but wrist band feels fragile,I had a Casio solar powered watch for almost 2 years until wrist band broke. I buy Casio Electro-Luminescent Sport Watch #AQ160W-1BV as replacement but the wrist band feels even more fragile than the old one.
3,Good watch but face scratches too easily,"This watch does everything I want, especially the timer and stopwatch. Both are easy to use for workouts or timing my son's soccer games. And the watch hands display the time even when you're in another mode. But the face has several scratches on it that make it hard to read. If the material for the face were better this would be a 5 star watch."
4,Small Prestigious Watch,"I just opened the package 15 minutes ago and here is my review ..Shipping : Amazon said I'll receive it on the 8th and I received it on the 7th so great work Amazon really !Watch Size : Much smaller that it looks in the pictures and I was really amazed on how small it is .. but still it's a good size watch to wear for everyday .Watch features : Every thing looks really great from the short time I've been trying it and messing around with the buttons except for the way you set the analog time it should be really improved .. the backlight make the numbers and letters on the screen glow while the background is still kinda dark which is really nice and give a better visibility .Over all I would recommend this watch to any one who would like a nice looking small size watch that gives you a very easy and nice ""2 ways"" to know the time every day ."
2,Bad service,"Before buying a Casio watch check out the service.I have 6 Casio watches, 3 of them went out. I contacted Casio on the Internet, what a joke!! First of all out of 3 watches none of them were listed on their web sight. I tried to contact customer service and that proved impossible, so like I said check out their service, I hope you have better response from them than I did."
1,CHEAPLY MADE,"Great for first few days...then the face developed severe scratching, making this watch unusable within a few weeks!! One of the most disappointing purchases I've recently made."
2,"Very Thick, not a sports watch, photo misleading","The photo is misleading.The problem I have with this watch is, that this is not a sports watch, as it said. Very thick, hence can not use for sports. It get damaged very easily. If you want a sports watch, buy any TIMEX product, they are great.This Watch is great in appearance and worth for the money. Great functionality, different time zones..."
1,"Great Watch, Extremely poor watch face","This watch has awesome features and looks great. However, the watch face scratched - by bumping into a wall - after only 1 week. This complaint mirrors the reviews others, which are written here. I have purchased $10 watches that have lasted years, and own a $100+ watch and none of them have ever been so easy to tarnish. Unless this aspect of the watch is fixed, I warn all buyers to AVOID PURCHASING."
2,Face is easily scratched,"Yes, this watch tells the time and does all the other stuff it's supposed to do, but it has one major problem. The face is made of plastic and it's soft. Really soft. My life is not overly active (I work in an office) but the face of this watch is just scratching up badly. I keep checking to make sure there isn't a soft plastic layer that peels off after shipping, but there isn't.I know they're making to a price, but I'd have gladly paid a bit more and got something that was a bit better built."
5,Men's Watch,Watch was delivered on time. The watch looks good and works perfectly. I use watch for work so needed something inexpensive and easy to read.
5,"Great, functional watch!","This watch is one of the best sports watches I've purchased. The price is definitely fair, and it comes with great functions. The watch has a 2-time zone clock, timer and stopwatch. It also displays the date or day of the week. I don't have a problem with accidentally pressing the buttons."
5,Great function and style...disposable,"I have ordered 4 of these...the watch is really good looking, has great functionality for treavelers, is versatile.Only negatives...the watch face does screatch, but at this price i keep one for outside work, and reorder one when my travel/work version gets scratched. Also wish the stopwatch marked hiurs for long endurance workouts' but it just rolls over.Still, really like this for travelling..time zones' looks good, and doesnt set off tsa."
1,Love the watch but resin band is junk,"I love the features of the watch (the easily settable countdown timer in particular - great for timing foods on the grill!) but the resin part of the case holding the band broke after just 3 months. The one year warranty doesn't help because it doesn't cover the band (or the crystal - which got scratched pretty easily).The warranty repair process is painful: register online, send in your watch (at your cost), Casio sends you an email either saying the repair is covered under warranty and they'll fix or replace it, or they send you an email with the cost to fix the watch. In my case the the cost to fix it was $35 while the watch itself cost $27! Plus there's no option to just have them send back the original watch - you either pay up or let Casio ""recycle"" it. Boo."
3,"Nice Watch, but scratches easily","It's a cool watch with all it's features (i.e. analog/digital, gold on black design, etc). However the face scratches very easily. The first day that I had it my hand bumped into something very slightly and got a small scratch right off. Since then I've gotten a few others. Now my last watch was a cheap Coleman from Walmart and with over 2 years of use it never scratched...This doesn't mean I'm going to stop buying Casio, but I'll never buy this particular model again."
3,Casio Men's AQ160W-1BV Ana-Digi Electro-Luminescent,"I was looking for a simple illuminated multifunction watch. This watch is illuminated, it is multifunction, but it is not simple to use. Casio makes decent products for general consumption but I remain puzzled how they could pack so many features into a $30 watch."
4,Nice watch with good features,"This watch does pretty much everything I want, looks good, and isn't too big. The only thing I don't like is the ""interface"", it's not as inuitive as many watches I've used. The procedure to set the analog time is hard to find and it takes a while, you don't get a knob like most analog watches."
3,60%,A good product. Light automatically turns on when you tilt your wrist to look at screen at night.
3,Not a bad minimalist watch.,"Bought this watch because I like having both analog and digital on my watch. While I don't use it much, the multiple time zone capability is a nice touch. Overall, fairly easy to use, with one major complaint. The analog is VERY DIFFICULT to set. It will only go forward to set, and this can take a long time. Make sure you read the direction, as there is a way to do it where you don't have to hold the button while it runs forward. This problem alone knocks the watch down a star. The watch was also slightly thicker, but had a smaller diameter then I expected. This may just be what I expected, based on my previous watch."
2,Cool features but difficult to read,"I'm dissapointed in the watch mostly because I find it difficlut to read it. There isn't enough contrast between the hands and the face of the watch. The digital readout is all but useless as you have to use the back light in order to read it. I also find the profile a little too high (i.e., it's too thick) for my taste."
3,Nice but weak built,"This is a really functional watch, but after just 6 month it just broke, i don't know why, i still use it with the analog function, but the LCD screen it's tottaly broken."
3,"Great watch,except for 'thickness'","I like everything about this watch except for how high it sits on my wrist. I like the large(but not obnoxious)displays. The pushbuttons work well and it's easy to navigate to most functions. In my line of work, I must often put my arms into tight spaces of machinery. The first day at work with my new watch, I managed to scratch the face of it.(because of its high profile) So that's my only complaint. Otherwise, a great watch."
1,A piece of junk,First time I wore it the wristband broke off.The seller said they shipped it and they only would take returns up to 30 day from shipping and I could not find an Amazon tele to call. It was about 35 days when I called them
4,Casio watch,The watch arrived on time and is really attractive. The only thing is the band is a lot thinner and slightly effeminate and/or cheapy. The watch features however make up for this minor shortcoming. All in all a great buy!
1,Good for Goodwill,"Lured by the positive reviews on Amazon I ordered this watch, but it's for people with better eyesight and more patience than me. It is also extremely fat and bulky on the wrist. The instructions are printed in a teeny tiny manual and I found them confusing and badly written (the online PDF manual makes the text more legible but not more readable). As for the functions.... I really have no idea, as I just couldn't get that far. Mine will soon be appearing at our local Goodwill store."
4,"Great for ""skinny"" wrists","I have been looking for a watch for quite some time now. The issue I was facing was that most watches have a large case diameter (as this is the style now). Unfortunately, I have skinny wrists and when I wear a large style watch it appears i am wearing my a flavor flav clock on my wrist!! This was not the case with the Casio Men's AQ160W-1BV Ana-Digi Electro-Luminescent Watch. The watch has a 42mm case diameter and an average size band. (The measurement in the picture description is not true) I am only giving 4 stars because the watch face scratches relatively easily. Although I have had the watch only a week it already has some minor scratches on it (nothing major). The illuminator back-light works great as well. It looks great and feels great on my wrist and I would certainly recommend. I am very satisfied!!"
2,Looks good. Not comfortable to wear.,"Good looking watch, with decent features but not comfortable to wear. First it has an exceptionally high face. 16mm compared to 10mm for most watches, which makes it rise very high off the wrist, and prone to hitting things and scratching the surface.The strap is also uncomfortable, but the biggest annoyance for me was the strap constantly slipping out of the loop.A minor thing, but when it keeps happening and you keep tucking it back in, you want to get rid of the watch or change the strap.I would have changed out the strap since it's a good watch, but it's built flush with the body so can't be replaced with a generic."
5,worth the paid USD,"I had this watch about 6 months. The construction appear to be long lasting. I took this watch several times swimming and snorkeling into the ocean, or to the swimming pool. Still working...never a problem. Only concern is that the glass (actually, I think is plastic)gets scratched pretty easily. The service provided by this watch is worth the little money (less than 30 USD)it costs."
4,Very good,"I use this watch for hiking.Pros:- Light- Fits a narrow wrist well- Has no sharp edges and is easy to read.Cons:- There's no setting to have the Date and the Day of the week to be displayed at the same time which is puzzling considering the amount of real estate on the dial.- Matching the seconds dial to the minute hand is not trivial.- The plastic crystal is slightly convex. This design ""feature"" unnecessarily increases the exposure of plastic to scratching. So the dial scratches easily. However, there are no sapphire crystal watches anywhere near the price category of this Casio so the point is probably not fairly taken.It is a good watch for the money, IMO. It tells time and is comfortable to wear."
3,Very nice cheap watch with a few flaws,"I purchased this watch after looking for a sub-$40 watch with analog hands and an alarm clock.Pluses:1. Cheap2. Has several alarm clocks, including one that is snoozable so you can use it as a wakeup call.3. Easy to use alternate time zone mode4. Easy to read with the back light onMinuses:1. VERY easily scratched face. It feels like a soft resin, and scratches even upon brushing it up against the wall.2. Analog hands don't glow for very long after leaving the light3. Analog hands are a completely separate function from the digital, meaning that if you have to set the time (even DST) you must manually change the analog hands to match."
2,Clunker,"Big clunker, very difficult to use, way too big for what it does. Not worth the money, Guess it's hard to buy a ""simple"" watch from info provided"
3,"Look great, but crystal scratches easy...",Pros: Looks nice; good mix of analog with digital display; very lightCons: Crystal very easy to scratch (took only 2 days); Analog hands don't glow; pressing any button after illuminating will turn OFF illumination; buckle bites into skin usually after getting wet.
4,Not bad,So far so good. Nice lighting for night. Only negative is that the crystal is easily scratched
3,Disney Holiday High School Musical 3 Pack,"Pedi in the three Spanish films, but the third came completely in English."
1,Useless and messy,"The float is not sufficient or properly balanced, so once the barley becomes waterlogged the entire planter is unstable and tend to flip upsidedown in the water dumping out the plant and the planting media."
1,Barley?,They make such a good case for buying this product. I found it to be a big waste of money. Not only that but it falls apart and causes more mess and clogs the pump. Don't buy this. It does not do what they say it does.
2,Not that effective,Only good for a sery small pond and you have to combine it with other algae or water clearing stuff. I didn't get any effect from it in my pond.
5,Charming,"This is my 22 month old's favorite book (she calls it ""Colour Babies""), and it's still fun to read after many reading sessions. The stories and illustrations show a real slice-of-life that fascinates toddlers."
3,Franz Kline-Strokes of Genius Series,"This is one of the few vhs/dvd's available about Franz and his work so you have to be patient with it, the video starts off slow and seems to be more about the history of the Village and has DeKooning and his wife Elaine talking about the old days and what people did for fun and where people ate and drank. It's very choppy at first and doesn't get around to really showing pictures of Franz and his best known art until the half way point, and in a thirty minute video that's not much time to cover the complex ideas and forms he is famous for creating. However, if you can pick up a used copy then I would buy it at least to have it in my video library of great artists. I only wish it had been longer and more detailed."
1,WHAT A WASTE!!!,"THIS PRODUCT IS HORRIBLE..WELL AT LEAST ON AFRICAN AMERICAN HAIR. IT LEAVES YOUR HAIR STICKY AND HAS A WHITE BUILD UP! ALSO THE SMELL IS MORE SO LIKE A SWEET MEDICATED SMELL. ITS JUST BAD. FOOL ME ONCE, NEVER AGAIN. I ONLY GAVE IT A 1 BECAUSE IT CAME BEFORE THE DELIVERY DATE!"
3,If you like a more classical style...this one is for you!,This is a good classic with some new songs. If you are looking for contemporary worship music this is not the CD for you.
2,Poems? Why poems?!?,"This book was a real disappointment. I was expecting some sound advice on motivation and instead got poems and cutesy verse. Full of pictures of him strutting his well-defined bod, it took me 10 minutes to read the entire book."
4,Yummy!,"With the demise of the delicious chocolate walnut Nectar bars I was forced to find a new favorite snack bar. This is it! While the other flavors I tried were just okay,this bar is super yummy! Please never discontinue it!"
5,one of my favorite bars!,"This is one of my favorite nutritional bars. It tastes great, is natural and not highly processed. It does not contain any eggs, milk, or peanuts, which is a big factor for me when I choose a bar. It tastes great...!From--- a very very picky eater"
1,Primal Bore,"I only bought this as part of a package with another DVD I which I wanted. I didn't have any expectations but thought it might be a good watch. I have all the ""du stade"" dvd's and whilst this wasn't a ""making of a calender"" film I thought it might be as entertaining.I was wrong.Overall quailty of filming is poor and the content is boring. Litterally 4 guys climbing rocks etc. There is no account for lighting (except for what the sun provides) so dark shadows and weird camera angles left me wondering how professional this actually was.All up, had I had this review prior to buying it, I would have saved my money or bought something else."
1,Failed experiment,This has been a $70 experiment. Thought it would be an improvement over my old Benriner mandoline.Save your money. Not smooth or efficient. Nominal adjustment. Blade not sharp. I want to mail it back to OXO but it will probably just end up at Goodwill. I have always liked OXO but this just doesn't fly Wilbur.
1,Picture and item sent did not match,The item pictured was not the item I received. I ordered an Oxo mandoline and instead an Oxo chopper was shipped. I thought there might be something wrong as the price from Popeil was 1/3 of the price from the other sites.
4,Invaluable but incomplete,"Gero has done the aviation safety community a great service by putting out this book. Students of the subject would be well advised to read it cover to cover. The most noteworthy content is the peek behind the veil at former Soviet accidents (which may have been the impetus for the writing of the book in the first place).Where Gero falls short is in his failure to mention a number of well-documented, high-profile accidents with significant implications to public safety. For example, the June 1995 crash of a B-52 at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington made international news, but is not discussed in this book. A 2002 update of both this book and his equally readable ""Air Disasters"", perhaps combined in a single volume, would be welcome to both add to the current content and bring attention to the final rulings on a number of high-profile accidents that occurred in the late 1990s."
5,This is one of my very favorite cookbooks!,"This cookbook has so many great healthy recipes that I have not seen anyplace else. I also love the tips they have in the margins all through out the book, such as: ""grating a stick of butter softens it quickly"" ""Potatoes will bake in a hurry if they are boiled in salted water for 10 minutes before popping into a very hot oven."" and ""To make granola chunky, add flour or dry milk, and water along with oil and honey.""I love how this is a quality hardback book also. One of my favorites and worth the full price I paid for it at an Amish store!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this book with high expectations, but was very disappointed. The directions were vague and sometimes impossible to understand for the one doll I attempted. Although this admittedly covers many techniques, and the pictures of the dolls can be inspiring, the technical writing of directions leaves much to be desired. Check it out at the library if you want to look at the pictures. There are much better books out there."
3,Very Basic doll making book.,"Good for beginners, even a pro will get something from it. Kinda fun to try various methods and materials for dolls. This will broaden your doll horizons a bit."
4,Color Management: A Comprehensive Guide for Graphic Designers,A very solid academic primer on color theory and color management. VEry recommended.
5,Um Kulthum like we never seen here before!,"Virginia Danielson had succeeded in presenting Umm Kulthum to us in ways we never anticipated before. She went in depth describing how the Egyptian society in the twentieth century impacted Arabic songs and how Umkulthum fit in all of this. In this book, I learned more about Um Kulthum the person, the wife, the daughter, and the singer. How strong she was and powerful. Reading the book helped me understand more about here music and songs, appreciate more here voice and how she chooses here songs lyrics. This is a should get book."
2,HMMMM,This book is not the most palatable work to read. Danielson fails to invite the reader who has little previous experience with Arab culture. Although there are some interesting moments I would strongly suggest becoming more familiar with Arab culture before tackling this book. Danielson seems to be writing for her ethnomusicology friends and forgot to invite the rest of us.
2,A bad buy,"Good for reading if you cant count sheep to fall asleep, but with no other practical use. I am amazed by the fact I cannot get even a single line of code out of that book and apply it (there is hardly any code) and the author's desire to go on and on discussing theoretical stuff and not even explaining their code if there is any. The pals assume you know already how to program in VB.NET and have done a few apps and now all you need is to get good theoretical background to become a teacher. Usefulness 0."
4,Effectively adds volume,"This is one of the only mousses I've tried that I actually feel does something for me. The spray design is a bit challenging to get used to, but it will ultimately keep your hands from getting sticky. Spray into the roots and lift your hair while you blow dry to achieve volume. It won't work without your help-- how you blow dry does matter."
1,"Weighed it down, made it sticky","I know everyone's hair is different and so it reacts differently but this product was not suited to my baby fine, straight hair. It made it feel kind of tacky and gummy and just weighed it down. I tried it about 5 times with varying amounts so I know it is not that I over applied."
5,A great series!!!!,"This author and her series is one of the best out there. If I had to choose between spending money on food or on her newest hardback book - her book would win out! Since the very first book, I have enjoyed her descriptions of the dogs and her little boy. Each book has gotten better. There are so many different reasons to like her books, the dogs and the descriptions of what is involved in dog shows, her relationships with her family, Aunt Peg, her ex and Sam, the mystery involved, her humor. This is an author I would definitely, very highly recommend."
2,Kinda cute mostly dull,"I really love dogs. I have four of them and they capture my heart in a way this book didn't. I really thought I would love this as the central focus is about a dog, but it just didn't turn out that way. This book is mostly flat information and description and some whining from the main character about her messed up life. I wanted to love it, but it just wasn't exciting enough to keep my interest. I gave up a little over half way."
4,A day brightener,"I've enjoyed most of Laurien Berenson's books, and this one was better again. - she really is maturing as a writer. The dialogue is great and she brings just the right amount of ""attitude"" to Melanie Travis.The plus is that this is a doggy book. Melanie inhabits a world of dogs and doggy people. If you've ever been part of that life you'll enjoy this book even more.This was a delightful quick, light read - a day brightener."
3,Not So Hot Dog,"I thought the author spent too much time discussing the characters feelings about her relationship. I mean we know about that from previous books. There wasn't much action in this story until near the end.There was no dead body, no murder,no real mystery to this story.It was more of a relationship story then a mystery. The author tried to make you think Melanie was being stalked and harrased but I just don't think she pulled it off. I know it's kind of hard to believe an ordinary person would continue to stumble over dead bodies but isn't that what we expect from these books? I still like this author and will continue to read her books but I just don't think this was one of her better ones."
1,"Unless Your A Dog Lover And Into Dog Shows, Don't Bother","I am currently reading this book, and it is totally BORING!!!!!The author goes way too deep into discussing the dog shows and how to take care of poodles. Who cares, if I wanted to know how to do that I would read a book on that specifically. Also, the story line never goes anywhere and the author spends too much time discussing the characters feelings. And the mother spends way to much time worrying about her dogs and feeling guilty about not being home for them. Get over it. She needs to get a social life!!!Besides who takes their dogs to work, and travels around with them constantly. The book is totally unrealistic. This is the first one I have read of this author and it will be the last."
4,great psych,very good album. a mixed bag of west coast style psych vs exploito psych. sound has that creation of sunlight feel others has that feel of any crazy exploito psych lp you might have played. fun lp recomended
5,works great!,"5 minutes to install, and they do exactly what they are supposed to. We have them for a bit of security when we crack the windows for the dog, and you actually can drive a highway speeds and get some air without a hurricane in your face."
4,"Short version, but GREAT performance!","This is an outstanding performance, where all the singers are very much involved to their characters. Ghiarov is something enormous here and Corellis Don Carlo is among the best I ever heard. There is so much passion in it! Verrett is superb and so is also Wächter.But it has some weak points, this performance. First of all, it is a very short version and Janowitz creates a sweet Elisabetta, but you can hear she gets tired in ending of the opera. Her vibrato becomes too dominating and therefor she also sometimes sounds a little bit out of pitch. I may be too hard now... After all she is very sweet.This recording is absolute worth having!"
3,Cut-rate,"This was my first recording but I was shocked while trying to follow the libretto how many cuts there were. I kept skipping through the libretto trying to find my place.However, I love Corelli and Verrett who is dynamite as Eboli. It's in my cd player now for relistening. My favorite (for its completeness) is the five-act complete version with Alagna/Hampson/Mattila/Van Dam.Last night I listened to a recording with Vickers/Brouwenstijn/Christoff/Gobbi that was absolutely thrilling (five acts). Christoff was absolutely riveting in this recording conducted by Giulini as Filippo and worth listening for that alone. I don't think there is a perfect recording of this opera with an ideal cast or complete score. So it's worth having several recordings of this opera."
3,"Good singing, poor version","This performance is more like 3.5 stars, sometimes four. After listening to other complete five and four act version the cuts in this four act version were somewhat disconcerting. Both cuts in the second and fourth act Carlo-Elisabetta duets ruin the flow and interupt the drama for anyone who was heard the full versions. The finale also seems empty without the appearance of Charles V and Elisabetta's final scream. I also was not as impressed by the Philip-Inquisitor duet as other reviewers. In his attempt to be menacing Tavela resorts to screaming and towards the end his ranting leaves him breathless and you can hearing him panting during the lulls in the music. As this is an older, live recording the sound is spotty at times, but is decent overall. That all being said the rest of the performances are good and the energy of the live performance adds to the excitement. At this price this recording is worth buying for a Don Carlo fan."
3,"Great recording, with flaws","Unlike most of the other reviewers, I was disappointed with Corelli in this recording. I am a great admirer of his, and bought this recording primarily to hear him. He was not in good voice this evening- he forces especially in the first act; later on he improves, but this is definitely not one of his best recordings. Waechter is also very disappointing, and shouts his way through his part. The duet between them is the worst I have heard- compare it to Vickers/Gobbi or Bergonzi/Fischer-Dieskau, and you'll see why it is so disappointing.Ghiaurov, as usual, gives an excellent performance, and the clash between Phillip and the Grand Inquisitor is the best I have heard- Talvella is superb, and the duet is far more dramatic than in the studio recording (Solti) with the same two artists.Verrett is excellent as Eboli, and Janovitz handles her part very well.It's worth buying this recording just to hear Verrett, Ghiaurov and Talvella."
4,A Discovery of Hidden Treasures,"I've bought this CD from a mere curiosity when I didn't know about this opera. I bought it just because I like Franco Corelli. The first time I played this set, I cannot help staying stood with my mouth open! After that I've got interested in this opera and bought another sets also. Just listen. And I could find the vocal dramacity of Shirley Verrett. She's exciting!! Although Janowitz sings pretty well, relatively her voice is not powerful like that of Callas, Tebaldi, Dessi or Caballe."
4,cozy pockets,"I love this vest, and the pockets are lined with this super warm fabric!I love that it is double-sided but only one of the sides has the quilting v-like look; the other is flat. Overall though, it is perfect."
5,Outstanding Coverage,"Even though this book is considered an elementary introduction, it is thorough, complete and up-to-date. Written with great clarity, it manages to cover the state of the art at a detailed level. It is clearly a textbook, but it provides enough reference materials for additonal study if desired. The publisher's review is understated. Recommended for anyone interested in the subject."
4,"Hot, Steamy, N'awleens with a Cajun flavor","I loved this book right up to the last chapter and then everything was a rush into a haphazard ending. But, right up until then the suspense was nail biting, the action riveting and the hero was so sexy, the steam was rising off the pages. Handeland delivered right up to the last chapter and then like I said, I am not sure what happened. I needed a little more closure and direction but it didn't ruin the book for me it just took off a star for that in-complete feeling. I am still looking forward to the next one."
2,This series has lost me,"Fourth book in the series. Cryptozoologist Diana Malone's husband died four years ago. She promised him she would find a cryptid, an unknown animal. Diana is hired by a rich guy to find and trap a wolf in a swamp near New Orleans. There she meets up with Adam Ruelle, a former Special Forces operative who lives a wild and secretive life in the swamp. Voodoo, werewolves, ghosts, murders, zombies . . . and it's still a sub-par story. The characters didn't grab me, the dialogue went on and on with page-filling mediocrity. Maybe it's time for this series to get a silver bullet."
2,Very Limited Dictionary,"This dictionary is extremely limited. Examples: for verbs, the aspect (perfective/imperfective) is not indicated, nor is the other aspect pair provided. For nouns, no indication of any irregularities in declension (for example, fleeting vowels) is provided. Very basic definitions are provided, but information needed to actually use/understand the language is absent."
5,My dog loves it!,We bought for our dog for Christmas and she loves it. As soon as we opened it she went right over and curled up on it! I have some great pictures!
3,Is HMV honest?,"After purchasing the CD ($18.99) and DVD ($21.99) at Toronto HMV (333 Yonge St.), I hope HMV is not selling them together at $22.99. Not ONE copy was available in the CD/DVD combination at the Yonge Street location on Nov. 18, 2003. If Jackson's 'Number Ones' is available in the CD/DVD format, then HMV is less than honest in its business practice and I've been really ripped off."
5,TRULY number ones...,"I bought it today, I can't let something that has not been proven beyond reasonable doubt keep me from the songs that I grew up loving. I can't tell you to buy it or not, but the songs are crisp and clear and It's a good CD for the price."
4,Michael Jackson Number ONES,"The songs are great! However, the reproduction of the CD sucks. Two of the songs on the CD end/just cut off before they are actually over and a new song begins. That was the only disappointing factor on this purchase"
4,Tracks are different,The tracks listed on here are different from what is on the actual cd. I can't find a website that lists what is exactly on the cd unless they are all different. Man in the Mirror and Ben are not on my cd. It actually had Human Nature and Blood on the dance floor. I was kind of dissappointed about that but it's still a good cd.
5,Michael Jackson Number Ones,"This cd I highly recommend! The songs take you back through his career.My favorite song is Ben, what a treat to hear it live.Michael is the best entertainer in the world. He will be missed greatley. It's comforting to have the cd as a rememberence of him.RIP MICHAEL"
4,My Favorite MJ Album,"I love listening to this album, now in my iPod. It has my absolute favorite songs ever by him and I would recommend this album to any Michael Jackson fan."
4,Loved it,Excellent choice! I bought this for my 3yr old son and he loved every single song in this CD.... Great hits by the king of pop!
2,"Buyer Beware, this disk is flawed",Great Micheal Jackson songs but the disk clearly states that song 8 is Man in the Mirror but it is a random song and Man in the Mirror is nowhere to be found on the disk. That was one of the songs I chose this for and not there. BAD production!!
4,A great Cd,This cd is full of the King of Pop's greatest hits except one song that I thought that didn't belong there which is Break of Dawn which isn't t hat great of a Michael Jackson hit whatever album it came from. If you are not that into Michael Jackson music then you should buy this album. May his music live on
3,Redundant Compilation! You Don't Need This!,"Alright, with the release of yet another hits compilation, I am almost convinced that Michael needs a new direction & record label. If you are a fan of Michael, you probably made better customized CDs than this weak offering by Sony, and that's still the BEST route to have the Ultimate Michael collection on CD.I refuse to buy the same old songs every couple of years because this new compilation contains songs that DIDN'T reach Number One on Billboard's Pop Chart (Earth Song, You Rock My World, Break Of Dawn).Don't get me wrong, Michael was the man, and we all know the classics by heart, but this new CD (with 4 different covers to choose from, wow!), should be overlooked, but I would recommend buying the CD single for the new track, 'One More Chance'"
2,Good idea that is poorly executed,"A album including #1 hits in the US and UK should include ALL the number #1 hits although one can understand why ""Say Say Say"" isn't on the cd (bad blood between Michael and Paul). Instead this collection features some #1s and songs that didn't make it to that position on either the US or UK charts. A perfect track listing for a #1s set for MJ would consist of the following songs: Ben; Don't Stop Till You Get Enough; Rock With You; Billie Jean (12"" version); Beat It; I Just Can't Stop Loving You; Bad (12"" version); The Way You Make Me Feel (12"" version); Man In The Mirror; Dirty Diana; Another Part of Me (US #1 R&B hit--12"" version); Black or White; You Are Not Alone; Earth Song (UK #1); Blood On The Dance Floor (UK #1); One More Chance (New song) and another new song lifted from the vaults"
5,great cd,the king of pop and all his best on one cd it dont get any better than that..great cd for sure
5,MJ does ONLY NUMBER ONES,"The King of Pop is gone, but his music will live forever. Rest in Peace MJ. This is an amazing CD."
1,poor quality,"The CD arrived timely and in seemingly great condition. The last track on the CD, the live version of ""Ben"", skips crackles and pops horribly. It was cheaper to buy a replacement at WalMart than to send the defective one back. Makes one wonder if this might have been a pirated CD. My wife and I were very disappointed."
3,Leave him alone,The song One More Chance is his best work since Bad. The single alone is worth the price of the cd.
4,Number Ones is a great compilation,"This is a great compilation of Michael Jackson's greatest hits, which includes my personal favorites, ""Dirty Diana"", ""The Way You Make Me Feel"", ""Billie Jean"", and ""Rock With You"". My only complaint is that the two songs from his ""Invincible"" album, ""You Rock My World"" and ""Break at Dawn"",and the exclusive song, ""One More Chance"", are disappointing."
4,nice cd,This cd has quite a few nice tracks on it. I'm not the biggest fan of michael jackson in the world but this cd was considerably good. It had a nice blend of slow songs along with a couple of nice dance numbers.. like thriller and beat it. Overall I thought that this was a good buy and a treat for michael jackson fans out there.
5,Big Michael Fan,I waited a LONG time to be able to purchase this CD. I was SO exited when it arrived. I play it so much. I was thoroughly pleased with how quickly it arrived and in perfect condition. Ripped it open and played it loudly in the house and then took it to my car. Playing it so loud the mirror shakes. I only do this for a short period of time so I do not affect my hearing. Ahhhh joyful moments.
4,"Missing a couple of hits, but overall a good CD",Only complaint - wish it had the duet with Paul McCartney. Otherwise a good compilation that the family enjoyed! Pair this with the This Is It DVD and you've got a good platform to become familiar with the King of Pop.
5,AMAZING COLLECTION OF POP MUSIC CLASSICS,"If you want the best greatest hits collection from one of the master's of modern music, then look no further! This collection proudly displays some of the greatest tunes that were ever created alongside some of Mike's newer creations. Whether you like vintage MJ or his new music, this CD is a must-buy! Worth every penny, and guaranteed to bring back memories of the good ole days when MJ was getting the respect he still deserves. Long Live The King!!"
3,You still rock my world,Didn't like all the songs selected for this album but Micheal still has it. Takes you back to memory lane.
5,Michael Jackson No. 1,This is an excellent CD. The music is crystal clear and the product was cheaper than any store I could find. You will enjoy this purchase.
1,Poor Effort,The CD was quickly delivered but is a blank CD. Everything looked legitimate with the plastic sleeve the CD was in and everything else but the CD has NOTHING ON IT!! This will be the first and last time i will purchase something from Amazon. Yes it was a small purchase but you'd think you would get the small things right!!!
1,Review,"It was a gift. Someone else asked for it. But when I hear it, it just reminds me how bubble gum pop simply gets recycled. Nasal singing, twangy, synthesized nonsense. Nothing that would- or should- ever be considered classic or timeless. Save your money or buy 6 packs of gum instead- the flavor will last longer."
4,Number 1's,"Even though most of MJ's music is great, this cd is pretty good. There are other hits that should have been included. ""Essentials"" is a much better representation of his greatest."
5,"Awesome CD, great songs",This is an excellent CD for any Michael Jackson fan..It has all his best songs on it...perfect A++++++++++++++++
4,The True Faith,"I can't be objective about this recording. I saved my money back in my high school days to buy the lps -- a 2-record set on Vanguard that also included Kondrashin conducting the 1st Symphony. To me, this is how the 'Leningrad' should sound: often harsh, never pretty, ultimately heart-rending by virtue of the great adagio's whispered poetry.I give it four stars to warn of the dated sonics -- mono, of course, and more constricted than the Ancerl/Czech Phil. recording that was released a few years later. But Mravinsky was the conductor who brought his orchestra closest to the heart of the music, by Shostakovich's own admission.Hear, and believe."
2,No thanks!,"As an avid Mravinsky/Shostakovich fan, it pains me to give this one the thumbs down - main problem is the digital remastering: SONY Super Bit Mapping, it claims on the inlay, but this is unlike any other SBM resissue I've heard - all life has been successfully (surgically?) removed and everything damped down to a deadly dull soundscape that quickly stops one caring what Mravinsky, Shostakovich and the music are about. Give me the Praga live performances with their crackle, splutters and coughing any day. Two stars because its Mravinsky, but unless you're a completist give this one a miss."
5,Adorable,"So soft and cute. It has a bit of heft in the feet so the bear ""Flops"" instead of just sitting up, always fun."
4,Polo the Polar Bear,"Just a small surprise for my daughter, which made her happy...our dog chewed up the first one. Fast delievery too"
3,"Okay, but not great.","I had 2 of them. They are history. One I gave away and I don't know where the heck it is. So, think BEFORE the buy."
3,Polar Bear Webkinz,"The toy is great. Seven year old girls love everything Webkinz. Unfortunately the one I received looked used. The delivery was fast but the Bear did not look very clean. Fortunately, my daughter never noticed!"
3,Good general reference on non-western religions,"Overall, the book provides a good general desk reference on religion, and is helpful in my field of religion reporting for newspapers. While it provides extensive coverage of non-Western religious traditions, however, it is somewhat lacking in its entries on American religious movements. There is no entry for the ""chavurah"" movement in Judaism, for example, scant information about Charismatics and just a page and a half about Pentecostals, who represent the fastest growing branch of Chrisitianity in the world and seem to merit more space. Perhaps a future edition could expand its coverage of these more mainstream movements."
4,Policy,"A.C. Arthur is back with another romantic suspense novel--OFFICE POLICY. Read along as Cienna Turner and Keith Page, two attorneys, try to figure out how to juggle work with pleasure.Cienna's goal is to make partner at her law firm. After a disastrous previous relationship, love was the last thing on her mind.Keith is well on his way to becoming a judge. Although plenty of women found him attractive, he didn't have time for the distractions and he wasn't the playboy people assumed he was.Although Cienna and Keith worked for the same firm, they didn't work on any cases together. Well that is, until destiny intervened and they were hired to defend Raleigh Simms in a sexual harassment case.Little did they know that this case would not only bring them closer, but also unravel some secrets that would impact both of their lives forever.A.C. Arthur has another winner with Office Policy. It's full of lies and deceit that will have you wondering what will happen next.Readincolor ReviewersShelia Goss"
3,Just Ok,This story for me was a little out there. It was just okay. I didn't really like the plot all that much. Not one of her best.
4,Angel,"I bought the 18k white gold floating heart. It is absolutely beautiful and very nice quality. I requested a different length chain when I ordered the necklace and was provided one at no extra charge. The chain is sturdy and has a lobster clasp. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was the design of the heart itself. It tends to turn upside down while on the chain, and I can't figure out how to rectify that without having a loop added to the back. I'm not sure if all floating hearts do the same thing. Anyway, I still love it and for now, I just remember to check it periodically to make sure it's hanging properly!"
4,"Very good, but...","...why bother getting it separately when you can have it as a part of the amazing domcuentary ""JFK: A Presidency Revealed""? Thta said, this is a very good, hero worship documentary, skillfully produced by A & E, as is their forte.Vince Palamara"
4,good video.....,"this is a good video on the life and times of John Kennedy, but it mostly concentrates on his early life. it hardly talks about his presidency, the cuban crisis, his assassination, etc.but still a pretty good video."
4,Awesome hold,"I love the hold, it really lasts all day! However it can feel crunchy on the roots when blown dry."
4,Product container is different from what I thought I ordered.,I ordered 8.5 oz. Black container with gold emblem on front of container.Which was to contain volumizing foam What I received was a 9 oz.container with a red label and a white label calling it Height of Glam. I e-mailed about the change and did receive instructions to return for refund. The instructios were so confusing I kept the order. The product seems to work. Is it the same item I ordered in a different container? or what? Martha Bennett
5,"3rd graders ""WOW""ed by BLAST OFF!","The music was great!...the filming fantastic!...and the opportunity to see the real stuff was awesome! It was cool to be able to see, read and hear all that this video had to offer."
1,A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!,"As a preschool teacher of 3,4,& 5 yr olds, I had high expectations for this video. It is very choppy with little or no explainations of what the kids are viewing. Occasionally there is a written line on the screen or a few words spoken, but basically it's pretty music with lots of unrelated pictures. The other video I purchased at the same time, 'The Big Space Shuttle', far exceeds this."
5,This Video Rules!!!,I love this video so much! The Spaceships are really cool and I love to watch them Blast Off. I have already watched it ten times and I know I will watch it a million more times!
1,Absolute garbage,"If you are looking for a study guide for the 0014 Praxis test, look somewhere else. This book will only confuse, mislead and frustrate you. Do not buy it under any circumstances. I am not even going to attempt to sell my copy because I would feel bad for the buyer. I'm going to burn it. Seriously."
1,Irrelevant,The questions are not written (or properly spelled in some cases) professionally. This creates more opportunity for confusion than preparation. Don't bother with this poor guide.
1,"Seriously, don't be like me....LISTEN TO EVERYONE ELSE'S REVIEW!!","This book is awful. It combines 0011 and 0014 material, just like everyone here warns about. The practice tests are useless because they are nearly duplicate! Seriously, listen to the people who rated this book poorly. As it turns out, they are right!How do these people even get away with publishing this junk?"
1,VERY unhelpful - Highly Subjective Questions,"I found this book to be extremely unhelpful. The 0014 test is supposed to be content specific questions, but this book asks highly subjective questions. Some questions are borderline personality questions! ex. Would you skip your dance recital for a mandatory school open house? If anything, this book will make your test anxiety worse! The only part of any value would be the reviews organized by subject material before the tests."
3,praxis II,"There are 4 sample tests for two different exams, but the book uses many of the same questions on all 4 exams. The book did show me how the test is set up and give me some practice and pointers, but I was furious when I realized the practice exam questions are mostly repeats!"
4,"ok, but...","i've gotten only to a point in the middle so far (studying the math part right now) and had an urge to write a review. This book so far seems an ok overview, but you have to take everything you read with a grain of salt. I'm not so competent in other parts, but I know math, and some things stated in the book are plain illiterate, for example ""between every integer is a fraction"", ""draw 2 concentric circles to illustrate the intersecting sets"" (when the diagram shows, naturally, non-concentric circles), etc."
5,The Best!!,"Spiritual Secrets to Weight Loss has been a blessing in my life. I have read it several times since I purchased it four years ago. After my third child I began having a battle with my weight, then a fourth child came along.... this book helps me to refocus each time. With God's strength, Kara's guidance, and Weight Watcher's online to log my info... I have lost consistently for the last two years. It hasn't been easy, but with complete lifestyle changes and physical activity, I've come a long way. Buy this book, keep it near you, and refer to it often."
5,Outstanding,Helps you understand that you can tap into the holy spirit within you to reach your weight loss goals. Biblically based ideas and a common sense approach.
5,A book that reaches far beyond weight loss,"I highly recommend this book. It puts you on the road to becoming a whole person in Christ. Before you consider any diet or weight loss program, this is definately a MUST READ!!!"
2,Accurate interface not helpful,I have owned this product for several years. The interface is very poor. Unless one uses it daily it is a very frustrating tool to use. Yes it works but for its cost - the buttons the screen - nothing is helpful about this instrument.
2,I'd rather listen to Sunn O)))),"The hype got to me and I picked this up. Really underwhelmed. Tracks are aesthetically similar to Sunn O))) but they are much more traditional in approach and sound like fuzzed up pop songs. Which, if they were interesting songs, might be good. There are some flashes of death metal but nothing original or exciting.Overall, where Earth and Sunn O))) take a traditional form and reinvent it, Boris goes back to the original template and produces something that isn't that compelling.To be fair, its not bad, it's just not that good."
3,This is UPSCALE not LOCAL pub food!!!,"If you looking for upscale/bistro meals than this is a great book with good recipes, but if your looking for good local pup grub try again. There isn't a steak pie recipe in this book and I've NEVER been in any pub with out it's own pie!!!"
3,It worked for me,"I purchased this tool to cut vertical cedar siding at the top (under the overhangs) to receive aluminum soffit panels. The saw worked well for the majority of the cuts, and I used a Fein Multimaster to get what I couldn't with the Crain saw. I rated this item with 3 stars because it worked fine and I'd use it again for the same task or other tasks (perhaps cutting jambs like it was designed for). I rated it with 3 stars because it has a lot of room for improvement, chief among the problem areas is its cumbersome depth adjustment. I would say this is a utilitarian saw at best. This saw could benefit greatly from some thorough engineering effort to improve its adjustment/guard systems and make it much easier to use."
2,Not very good,"I picked up this novel hoping that Jeffrey would offer up something new. New insight into Revelations, new thoughts about what it means to be a Christian, or just a new, exciting endtimes novel. Unfortunately, he accomplished none of that. Cashing in on a trend without the talent to pull it off doesn't strike me as the most Christian of endevours. If you're looking for a quality book about Revelations, try Brian Caldwell's We All Fall Down instead. It's intellegent, compelling, and utterly engrosing. It puts this book to shame."
3,Good But In Error,"The writing and story is actually very good, but because I believe that the authors underlying biblical views are in error, that it looses it's relevance."
5,Bobby Darin Sings Doctor Doolittle & Born Walden Robert Cassotto,"Although a huge Bobby Darin fan, I never purchased the vinyl Dr. Doolittle when it was first released, although I have since secured a copy via a record show. I guess the limited appeal of the movie didn't set me on fire. I didn't buy the CD of the LP when it first came out.The real gem of this is BORN WALDEN ROBERT CASSOTTO. The first of two LPs on his own Direction label, I actually purchased them both when they first came out in the late 60s. Long Line Rider references the same source for the Robert Redford film BRUBAKERBrubakerand is a chilling tale. In Memorium is a tribute to his idol, BOBBY KENNEDY. But I found out about the LP when I found the single for CHANGE is a nickle bin at a record store. Still my favorite of the LP.This, along with COMMITMENTCommitment/Rare Darinis a must for any true Bobby/Bob Darin fan."
3,Not a how too book,"It's a nice book, easy read and dips into the stress of playing with the ""big dogs"" on the show ring circuit. However, other than pick your handlers carefully and dog showing is expensive, there's really no knowledge to be learned here."
4,Pretty good--fast read!,I really enjoyed this look into the world of dog shows. The author doesn't hide the truths of the ins and outs of the world of showing and breeding dogs. Quick read--I read it in a day. Very well-written. Great little book!
4,"Not one of the best, but still very good","I've seen and purchased several Kidsongs video's. The video starts off with the kids singing ""We have the whole world in our hands"". I love the idea of ""Mr. World"" taking the kids to different places, and teaching kids there is no difference in people that have different skin color. There's is only one piece that I really don't like, and that is when ""Mr. World"" takes the kids to Italy. ""Mr. World"" slams spagetti into the sauce pan, then takes the pan and spagetti and drops handfuls of noodles onto the kids heads. The rest is very good. Great singing and entertainment that keeps my 18 month old watching for the entire 30 minutes."
5,Solid!!!,"This is an incredible cd I would encourage anyone who likes Contemporary Gospel to buy this cd I mean it is one of the best ultimate collections I have ever purchased and I love the whole cd the whole cd has some good tracks on it I really do enjoy each and everyone of these gentelemen the only one that is living now is Jerry Butler. Brook Benton and the Immaculate Incredible, Multi-talented Curtis Mayfield there is no way to describe this musical geinus he is deceased also..... This cd contains so many good hits that I can't even name them all But I will name my favorite tracks on the album: We are a Winner!!, Amen, People Get Ready, Your Choice of Colors , and Your Precious Love this is a wonderful awesome immaculate cd I love this whole album buy it there will never be another Ice-Man Jerry Butler, Brook Benton, and last but not least Curtis Mayfiled;R. Kelly is good but he cannot touch Curtis Mayfield!!!!"
2,Not the one I wanted,I heard the music in a movie but this is not the group that was singing. So I guess I got it by mistake and if I had known that I would not have purchased it. They are talented and the music is ok.
5,Impressive Impressions,I grew up listening to groups like the Impressions and really enjoy their sound and quality of lyrics and instrumentation. You can't go wrong with the older R&B groups.
2,I've seen better.,"As a senior college student majoring in electrical engineering, I believe that this book needs more examples. The problems at the end of each chapter rarely correlate to examples given in the text and I spend hours looking up equations. All in all, I am not enjoying using this text book."
4,Innacurate Examples,"Don't get me wrong, this book covers Microwave Engineering in great detail and covers all important topics in the field but be warned! There are many mistakes in his examples which often makes it tricky to follow the design steps. As long as you remember this, you'll be fine."
3,"Beautiful Set, a few issues","I purchased this item, and it came and was beautiful. The table is very sturdy and has that shiny polished wood look. The chairs however are my issue. They look nice when set up, but are not sturdy or secure when sitting on them. The wood that is used to support the bottom where you sit, is very weak, and when my thin and older parents sat on it, they both buckled and broke in the same spot, The stress area of the chairs are in the middle. They break easily. This is a great set, just the chairs need to be reinforced on the bottom where you sit."
1,"NOT 8"" as listed. Only 3""!",Horrible descriptions and incorrect. Purchased a complete set of action figures from these guys and the item was listed as 8 inches. I receive the action figures and they are only 3 inch's. Thanks for ripping me off. Be careful and watch out for this sellers other listings. I would not trust the item descriptions.
1,I returned this product,"When I saw this garden flag I thought the price was high but they did have free shipping & I thought maybe it was of better quality than the last few I had bought, they only lasted one season. If anything, it was of lower quality & smaller than I expected. I was able to return it without too much trouble. I did find a satisfactory flag for $14.00 plus $5.00 shipping. My advice is keep on looking."
1,Cheap-o plastic cups,"If all you want are tiny, chinsy little plastic cups, fine. But these things are way overpriced for what you get. If you're expecting some kind of nice, hefty, usable cup ... don't buy these things."
4,If you can walk you can dance,"Marion Molteno has the ability make your skin respond to the climactic situation of London in November or Zambia or South Africa in the full glare of high summer..your ear can hear and your body feel the dark brown timbre of a solo viola and can lift you out of your chair and suspend you on a single cello note. She can bring unexplained tears to your eyes and then to your cheeks and all the way to your chest [though you don't know why] when she writes of recieving written music through the post.She can give you her loneliness to use in place of your own and soothe your sad longing. She can tear through your most well crafted excuses and ask you,as would an infant, why you don't just 'be happy?'. She can pull this vehicle through the most wrenching manoevers as if it were the flow of a sweet and subtle dance which you feel you can do the same...or at least want to"
5,Stunning photographs,"The special feature of this catalog is the quality of the photography and reproduction. Many of the pieces are familiar, but these are the best pictures you will see of them. The volumes and surfaces are rendered as if you are holding the pieces in your hands, feeling their materials. Maybe it's not virtual reality, but it's as close as close as the printed page can get. There are also pieces from European private collections that aren't so familiar, at least not to me. As with most exhibitions, the works are chosen for their visual power rather than how well they represent the overall production of a region. For purposes of connoisseurship, they are extremely well chosen."
5,Arts Of Africa : 7000 Years Of African Art,"409 Pages, 11.25"" x 8.75"", Hardback, very nicely bound and published without a dustjacket. From the Grimaldi Forum Exhibition, Monaco, July 16th - September 4th 2005, Translated from Italian into English. Curator : Ezio Bassani. Published by Skira. Featuring the following chapters in the Ancient Art Section : Nubia, Nigeria, Nok, Igbo Ukwu, Ife, Tsode, Owo, Benin, Esie, Calabar, Bura, Sapi.

Well photographed, good quality paper and production. Highly Recommended."
2,Just watch TV instead,"Albeit I'm not much of a TV viewer I rather see this TV series than read another book like this.When you read a book and since the beginning you know who's the bad guy half plot goes down. If you read technicalities that you don't understand just to show that the writer knows too many things that you really don't care, there goes down the other half. When you finish this book you'll know how to build a rocket. How to make more powerful fuel for it. How to make drugs heavier, and many other things. Of course to do all that you'll need a very special paraphernalia. So I rather start watching TV than read another like this.If you like to read about TV series read ""24 Declassified: Veto Power"" by John Whitman. This book'll thrill you all the way."
2,Not enough there,"This is an OK book, I suppose, but I can't give it a rave like everyone else. For me, there just wasn't enough to it.It does have a lot of history and so on, so for that it's good. But I found the star charts poor. The main ones are too large-scale to be of much help, and the finder charts don't include enough stars to get you oriented.For each object, there is a lot of space spent on Messier's original notes. Mostly, they turn out to be boring. There is also a short ""Facts"" section, which has only very basic data.The photographs are interesting. On the one hand, they're all at the same scale, so that you get an idea of the relative sizes of Messier objects. On the other hand, they show the objects in far more detail than you'll ever see in even an 8"" telescope.Finally, the observing notes are fairly dry; that is, they don't inspire much interest, let alone wonder.I returned the book, and I'll keep looking for a Messier book that delivers more."
5,Excellent resource,"This book is nicely done, easy to use, and not overly patronizing. I strongly recommend this book over Steven O'meara's Messier Object book. In contrast to Stephen O'Meara, Ken Graun treats his readers like equals and does not toot his own horn. Ken Graun has simply laid out a very nice resource with good photos that show realistic views of the sky. O'Meara, in contrast provides unrealistic images and commentary thick with self-importance. If you want to have some help looking for M objects, but are confident that you don't need someone telling you how to wipe yourself, then get Ken Graun's book. Also, Ken's historical information and photos are quite nice."
5,This Book Has ONE Thing That Makes It Unique AND Important,"Deep Sky Objects (DSO) are hard to see. This is partially because they are faint and the viewer doesn't know what to look for. A star chart shows where something is, but not what it looks like. Hubble images are pretty, but not realistic.This author uses a small 4"" scope, concentrates on a typical backyard scope eyepiece of about 20mm, and takes every picture to scale. Every messier object is photographed, much like it will look to the viewer. This is an encredible aid and sets this book apart from all the other Messier resources I have been using.If you want to search for the Messier objects, this is the book for you. You will need a good set of charts."
4,Gorgeous but get rid of the name on the back,I bought this as a gift for a friend. I didn't read the entire description prior to purchasing.I was looking for something with a fox on it. I loved this since it had the celtic knot on it as well as the fox. It was the perfect gift for my friend so she would remember her (Irish) Fox friend (it is a Wood Badge Boy Scout Patrol thing).She opened the gift and LOVED it until she turned it over and another friend noticed it said FERN on it. Then we laughed about online shopping when I told her I only looked at the picture prior to buying it.
4,"fresh views, yet sometimes the evidence is not there","This new translation of Analects provides us with a fresh view on Confucius' Way as it was, at least the authors claim so. It is correctly pointed out in the book that the task of reconstructing the ""original"" Confucius is inevitably interwined with our ever-changing understanding of the pre-Chin Chinese intellectual history. The task is never going to be easy, and is highly influenced by subjective preferences of individual researchers. The authors provide an updated theory of how the Analects was written in the course of several hundred years. One thing I like most is that convincing evidences are given to show that filial piety was NOT central in Confucius' morality. However, there are some other shaky arguments. For example, their effort of establishing this guy or that guy as the leader of the early Confucian disciples is too imaginative."
4,Worth it!,"I bought it, I like it, I use it, it's worth it. Have read it cover to cover twice. But since this is a book about typography, I can't resist pointing out errors in that vein.1. There is no example C with figure 7.9, page 92.2. There is a double-hyphen on page 157 in violation of a guideline on page 158.3. A spell check would have caught the ""areis"" on page 212.4. The hyphenation break on ""conservation"" violates the very guideline being stated on page 157.There are other typos, but let me move on. Biggest weakness: the book stops abruptly on p. 262. How about finishing with a wrap-up chapter of some kind? This could include summary-level checklists. Even so, I would still buy it again."
2,Please Tell Us More,"The book contains the harrowing first person narrative of Dr. Seita's childhood through early adulthood. He has lead a remarkable life. A deeper exploration of Dr. Seita's experience including the motivation and methods he used to deceive and confuse the adults who came to help him would benefit anyone who seeks to reach children who are coming through equally hellish travails. But Dr. Seita offers only generalizations like those he lists in a section titled ""Claiming Unclaimed Kids"" such as ""10. Touch in Small Ways, 11. Give Seeds Time to Grow, and 12. Keep Faith and Hope Alive."""
4,Perfect description,"The book was slightly damaged (some tears and spots on pages)but I was previously told that, and aside from that It was perfectly fine."
4,Yummy and different,This bar has a unique taste. It is good chocolate and toasted sesame seeds. I eat it slow because it is dense but it is not too big of a bar-just the right size. It is not as nutritious as the other nut bars but it offers variety to the mix.
2,Bars are rock hard,"Don't get me wrong, the bars taste good, but golly gee whiz they are so hard I am afraid I'll break a tooth. I cancelled my order for this reason."
5,Real Yankee Cooking,"I have been going to Durgin Park for the past 40 years and it is always the same. Real down home Yankee Cooking. The food is always great and very fresh. I was told that everything is bought daily and it is obvious by the quality of the food. If you are ever in Fanuiel Hall Market Place in Boston, this is a must to go too. Also, buy the book as there are real great recipes to try and there is also the history of Durgin Park in it. You won't be sorry you did............. Enjoy"
4,For the Geologist minded,"I saw this book as a geologists stand point on what types of rocks to look for when trying to find gold. Also, what types of rocks that gold is commonly found by. The book would of had five stars if it would of had pictures so you could see what was being described."
2,"Good, but expensive to maintain","This printer is very good. I had it for about 3 years and I use it to print almost everything, from letters, envelopes etc. The biggest flaw I would say would have to be the occasional replacement of products. There are about 3 additional parts that require replacing (this is not including the 4 ink cartridges) While this is normal for most laser printers, the cost of these parts go well over the inital cost of the printer. The fuser alone sells for $350, the transfer roller around $60, the imaging unit $330, and the 4 cartridges around $100 each. When you add everything up, it comes up to be almost 3 x TIMES MORE than the printer it self (which is around $450) so basically, every year, you would be buying 3 printers."
4,Great Ideas...,I gave this book to my husband for Valentines Day. It is filled with great ideas on how to say I love you in new and creative ways.I just wish that it came with a guarantee that they will be used on you.
4,Moving,Steel Magnolias is a well written play that is easy to read. It describes the life of 5 ladies and causes you to feel as if you are a part of their lives. It is a moving book and expresses the power of love and friendship and endurance. It shows how the life of one can easily affect many others. We often take for granted the ones we love. This play helps the reader to realize this. I really enjoyed reading this play.
2,"Wonderful play, alas soooh male-bashing",It's a huge crowd pleaser and tear jerker but count the number of lines saying something good about a man and you won't find one. Count the number of lines saying something bad about a man and I'm guessing it's 15. Is that really justifiable? Really?
4,THE PANASONIC DVD-RV31K,"I REALLY ENJOY THE PITCHER QUALITY AND DIFFENT FEATURES, BUT I NOTICE THAT MY AUDIO SOUND IS BETTER FROM MY VCR, THAN MY DVD-PLAYER. ALSO MY REGULAR CD-HEAD CLEANER WON'T WORK WITH MY DVD-PLAYER. SO HOW DO I CLEAN MY DVD-PLAYERS HEAD."
5,THE BEST OF THE BEST,"I literally spent 3-4 hours scouring the ...(web)sight for a DVD player w/ a combination of all the features I wanted. This one was it. It plays CD, CD-R, & CD-RW. That alone is a rarity. It has optical digital output (despite the fact that on the comparison chart this feature is not indicated). This unit has consistently excellent reviews. It has a GREAT price, & is available for shipping in a very reasonable time frame. ....The sound quality is outstanding, the picture is clear as crystal & sharp as a razor's edge. It's way EZ to use. This unit also has a bunch of other great features that one wouldn't expect at this price. I have had NONE of the problems that are mentioned in the reviews for the units that are in the same & lesser price ranges. TRUST ME, you will not find a better unit, with more features, in this price range. Clearly Panasonic has set the benchmark."
1,Never Buy From Panasonic Again,"Okay, anyone who scans these reviews will know the truth--this product is a piece of garbage. It works fine for a few months, then stops working. It gives you an H02 or H03 code and when that happens, the thing is essentially finished. You can get Panasonic to fix it for labor costs (not covered by warranty) that exceed the cost of a new unit. Or you can do the self-repair suggested by several reviewers here to get a few more hours of use out of it--but no more than that. The real issue here is why Panasonic has not bitten the bullet on this one and refunded the money to any customer who bought this defective unit. Join me in never buying anything from Panasonic ever again. If there is justice in this world, the company will go bankrupt."
4,The H02 problem,"After google searching this, I finally found a way to fix the so-called ""deadly"" H02 problem. A thanks to ""miguel_cerca"" who posted this message on videohelp.com (http://www.videohelp.com/dvdplayers.php?DVDnameid=2473&Search=Search#60617). People have tried air compressor to clean the insides but this dude pretty much opened the cover while it was on, popped in a disc and pressed play..(""then manually gave the disk a little push in the clockwise direction and bingo, no more H02 error""). I tried it and IT WORKS!!! Thanks Miguel!"
1,Consumer reports gives Panisonic repair excellent NOT THIS 1,Used 2 years by parents that used DVD twice a month.H02 errorH05 errorcalled repair said motor and laser errorsalthough I have taken apart laser at least lights and motor does go. Can get it to read disc if unit is 45deg but will only read for 1 min.Very modual design if I could get the assembly for $40 I might repair but then again my $30 DVD player is still working with similar use.
4,I really don't understand the criticism of this item.,"Having read many of the reviews on this item, I decided to buy it because the positive reviews seemed to indicate that those who liked it were likely to have read up on and reasearched the item, while thsoe who wrote negative reviews apparently didn't read the manual, or would have been dissatisfied with anything which didn't measure up to a preconceived notion. For example, one reviewer said that the player didn't remember where it was when the stop button was pushed. I didn't find that to be so. However, if one pushes the play button too quickly, it will go to the scenes. READ the MANUAL! Pause, and it will go to where the movie left off. Also, I read where the loading or opening was too slow. I have a Pioneer DVD-player with which I am quite satisfied, and it is comparable to that one.I haven't had it long enough to go five stars, but I will in six months if the current performance continues."
3,Decent For The Price,"I received this DVD player as a gift. Is definitely a good price for a good product, however I experienced variations in video colouration (it would fade from dark to light throughout the course of ANY DVD). I am not sure if it was a single defect or a product defect that they all share."
1,Worst DVD Player I've had so far,"I've gotten the infamous H02 error also, and can't express how dissatisfied I am with this product. It would be in your best interest not to purchase this DVD player."
3,Good DVD Player,This is a great DVD player! Great sound and picture quality although I can not get it to play DVD+R movies. If any one can help with this problem let me know..
2,Great value...at first....,"I too am getting the dreaded ""H02"" error associated with the player locking up during playback. This started happening after owning theunit 8 months (I guess I should be happy I got 3-4 months more than the other posters with similar issues :-(). This happens with discs that used to work and varies where/when it happens on the disc. To fix it, $90 plus shipping et al. Might as well buy a different brand."

1,serious quality problems,"I ordered one of these two months ago, and after playing a couple of DVDs accurately, it began to have very serious problems: the picture would freeze and decompose, the soundtrack would go out of synch. I returned it for a replacement -- and again, after playing 2-3 disks accurately, it has begun to do the same thing. Given the other negative reviews for this product, I imagine this problem (or something like it) is pretty common, not just the occasional lemon. I would not purchase this model unless Panasonic indicates that it has resolved the problem."
1,Error Code H02,I have had my unit for 4 months. Last night while my daughter and I were watching Harry Potter it stopped and despite every effort to start it all I could get was an error code H02. I called Panasonic and they told me the warrantee was for 90 days labor and 1 year parts and that I would have to send the unit in to get serviced at my own cost. Buyer beware. This is an unreliable machine. It may seem a good buy but for me it was just wasted money. Look for a better quality product. This is shoddy.
1,Panasonic RV31k went belly-up replaced w/t Apex AD 2100,"-My Panasonic RV31k went belly-up after 8 months.I bought the Apex AD-2100... and it is FAR superior to the Panasonic. It just hit the market and has twice the features of the older RV31k. It plays all my DVDs, MP3 disks, VCDs, flawlessly and it handles HDCDs, and the new WMA, Windows Media Audio format. Thats 22 hours of music on a CD-R. The JPEG fuction is super cool. Just fill a CD-R with JPEGs, set the player on shuffle mode and enjoy the show!Oh... I do have one negative. the remote feels & looks cheap. However it does work well and even has a one button switch between Wide and Full-Screen which works on the fly. Also the Player itself looks expensive. The silver case and front panel is sleek and polished. You don't see it in the photos but even the display is hidden behind a mirrored glass panel so the front presents a smooth unbroken silver surface until the unit is powered up and playing a DVD....Peace."
3,Pretty good,"I was happy with this DVD player until I bought a new computer with a DVD burner.This player cannot play DVD-R discs (personally burned DVDs).It also can't play DVD audio discs.Also, it says that it will play mp3 cds - but the way in which you need to format those cds is so cumbersome as to make it not worth the effort.If you're just going to rent movies, then this is a fine player at a great price - but that's about the limit of this player."
2,H02 - me too,"6 months old. Good, except when it's not working, which appears to be quite often. I too found it got worse over about 5 minutes, until... kaput. Can't read any disc (CD, DVD etc), and eventually comes up with H02 on the display. What a POS - a shame. It was only used quite rarely. Reset command (Hold Rewind, Open, and Pause till it says initialize, then power off then on) didn't fix it. Going back. Hope I can get a better replacement one.., like one made by another company."
5,great DVD player.,"This is a terrific DVD player. The images are sharp and the DVDs load pretty fast on it. It has a large number of features for a player with its price, and the controller is easy to use. I also found out recently (according to consumer reports) that its really good at reading damaged DVDs. I am very pleased."
1,HO2 Error - The inevitable destiny for this piece of Trash,"I will try not to repeat what HUNDREDS of people have written here (and I assume there must be thousands more cases out there). All of a sudden this DVD stopped working showing the HO2 error. Very inocent of me to come over the Internet looking for an easy fix just to find out Panasonic screwed me, and hundred of people, with a defective expensive DVD Player. I tried the fix described by others but it didn't work. I am shock to find out that this is in fact and without question a defective product that went to market and PANASONIC should have recalled it. As for me, I will be away from Panasonic electronics (not becauseof the player defect, but for the company lack of responsability). As for you, do yourselve a favor and STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLAYER BECAUSE YOU WILL END UP LIVING THE INEVITABLE DESTINY OF THIS TRASH: THE HO ERROR!"
2,Do your research before spending!,"This DVD player is wonderful, while it works! Be prepared for this player to mysteriouly quit. After less than a year and a half the player came up with an h02 error. Panasonic help line will tell you that it's a humidity problem and that all you need to do is reset the player but this is not true. Research on the internet will tell you that this is because of the faulty lens.Do your research first and be sure to buy the extended warranty!"
1,"The worst choice possible, stay away",I feel sorry for the people who are happy on receiving this player and give it four or five stars. Maybe you should wait till the parts and labor warranty expires instead of misleading other customers. You will soon realize the pain of 'HO2' or 'HO3' error. Amazon.com is only too happy to keep its positive review on this product in spite of being repeatedly informed about its problems. I guess money is more important than customer satisfaction. No wonder the price of this product keeps dropping. Opt for the more reliable Toshiba or Sony brands instead of this junk. I myself am never buying a Panasonic product again.
1,H02 Error!!!!!!,I bought this unit on Ebay. So I don't really know how old the machine is. But only in couple of months I got this dreaded H02 error. From other posts it seems the usual way for this item to go. Would not buy another Panasonic DVD Player!
4,haven't had a single problem in 2+ yrs of owning,"I haven't encountered the dreaded h02/h03 error but I don't give this DVD player as much mileage as others probably do. I love this player thoughPros:- Great Video and Sound (from what a non video professional's point of view)- Has played most of my mp3 CDRs with no problems, making it a good option for parties- Nice to have optical sound out and component video at this price, I just bought an onkyo HT system and plugged everything in and it worked without any glitches.. now only if my tv would support hd :-)- Good set of features for the priceCons- nothing that really bothers me too much but the remote could be designed betterI don't know about the complaints of others but I would recommend this player and hope everyone enjoys it as much as I have and will."
2,Great while it lasted,I guess I'll join the chorus. My RV31 worked great for almost two years but now it's just a paperweight. I too get the H02 error although sometimes it just stutters. I will never buy another Panasonic product again. Way to go Team Panasonic!
1,Cost to fix the h02 problem?,I'll not repeat the problem since it seems thousands of others have had the same with this machine....But....Has anyone had one repaired? I'm interested to find out how much it cost to fix?Dont we consumers have any rights / comebacks for this kind of faulty product?
4,Well worth the price!,"I bought this unit about 3 years ago (1999) and it still works brilliantly...However, I have had no problems with the unit and I use it all the time. Especially at the list price right now ... it is well worth the price. It is thin, sleek, and the remote is well designed and easy to use. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the unit."
1,Don't spend the money,"I too thought I had a good product when I got this player 13 months ago. It worked well until the other day when the disc tray wouldn't stay closed. It won't even stay closed when I power it off. When I contacted Panasonic they washed their hands of the problem. I'm now in search of a new DVD player from a new manufacturer. Don't spend your money no matter how low the price. Too bad there wasn't a ""zero"" rating. A ""one"" is too generous."
1,Absolute CRAP,I got the H02 error and could not fix it. Tried spinning the white gear several times. I received a 120V shock on my wrist for my effort. F*** YOU Panasonic! Don't buy this piece of s*** unless you need a $300 doorstop.
4,Meets my needs!,"This is good DVD player with all features including MP3 playback capability. As many have mentioned, sound is good but changing sound modes have no effect. Its all the same! I am still happy with it as I wanted a DVD player which plays CD-R, CD-RW and MP3 in addition to DVD...."
4,Good DVD Player at Reasonale Price,"This is good DVD player at reasonalble price. As matter of fact, this DVD player is being sold at local store around $... Good deal at amazon.com"
1,H20 Bites!,"I bought the Panasonic A-120 a year and a half ago. It died in about 6 months because ""the drive motor"" went. I then purchased another Panasonic, the RV31. Panasonic had a good rating on Amazon and maybe I got a lemon before with the A-120. 3 months later, the RV31 failed as well. The ""H2O"" came up on the DVD player and never went away. The repair shop said it needed a ""new drive mechanism"". Panasonic said ""were very sorry. Send it to us and we will fix it"".... along with $90 and shipping cost's. Another reviewer put it best when they said this unit has a serious design flaw. Read all of these reviews on Amazon before you purchase! ""H2O"" is a serious problem. After 2 Panasonic's that failed, I will never buy another component from them."
1,decent player - WHILE IT WORKS!,"I suppose I now hold the record for the longest running of these dvd players, having purchased it early last year .... At the time, I was rushed for a birthday gift for my wife and obviously didn't do enough research on this boat anchor. First of all, the special features such as ""dialogue enhancer"" do nothing for the dialogue - there is a tendency for the background music to drown everything out regardless. The shortcomings of the mp3 functions have already been listed, so I'll move on to the players worst feature - the fact that after any sort of serious use, the player begins freezing up and eventually dies completely with an HO2 error (yes, mine is now dead too, after 11 months). Panasonic should be petitioned to issue a factory recall of this obviously defective unit."
1,Good for the first year...then it [poops] out,"I, too have fallen victim to the dreaded ""H02"" error. I'm gonna check ...(where I work) to see if anyone might be able to fix it for cheap, but most likely I have to buy a new one.I love how it works just long enough for the warranty to run out, and then it just dies completely. STAY AWAY!Oh and Panasonic won't help much at all, even if you point out to them that this is obviously a factory defect and they should do a recall or something. They just act ignorant."
1,Crap,"Whatever you do don't buy a Panasonic DVD player. I had mine for only about six months and it died giving me an H02 error everytime I put in a DVD. I only watch a movie twice a month at the most!!!! I contacted Panasonic and they said that for a fee they would fix it, but I have heard from others that it will break again in another few months. What nerve. I have to pay for their design flaws? I had an old Panasonic TV that was good and is still living to this day. Because of brand loyalty I bought the DVD player, but just as I am very loyal to brands that take care of their customers and provide quality products, I am very disloyal when this type of crap happens. Stay away from Panasonic!"
1,Another disappointed customer,"This DVD player worked well for about one year and two months. Last week I got the infamous H02 error. Since then it haven't read anything for me, becoming just a piece of garbage. I didn't know Panasonic sells disposable equipment. Fortunately, I could watch my two most recently purchased DVDs on my PS2. I am considering buying a *real* DVD player but now I'll be confident to Sony or Pioneer, I won't waste my time and money looking for another joke from Panasonic. Please don't buy this DVD player, you can find much better players for the same price. You better consider another brand, like Sony, Pioneer or Philips."
2,H03 And How I Fixed It,"Well I too am a victim of the H03 (or H02, I'm not sure I understand what the codes are). Well the good news, is I came to amazon.com to print my invoice and check the warranty on this POS. When I started reading the ratings, I decided to take the cover off. Procedure: Took off the cover and gently spun the mechanism. Plugged in; NOTHING. Spun the mechanism while plugged in; NOTHING. Then I just gently tapped on the ""white circle"" about three times and BOOM its all working again.I had to go to 2 stars though because I have gotten about 5k hours out of this player. With four kids, who refuse to turn the thing off when they leave 5 minutes into the movie, it has done some serious work for my family. But this is still unacceptable...especially when you consider I have a $....APEX that has about 20k hours on it and has not bobbled.Good luck,Dr. Kevlar"
1,I trashed mine 30 min ago,"I wish amazon had something called a ""Zero Star "" . I got the H02 error code exactly 1 year and 8 days of use . ( I was out of country for a week.) Looks like Panasonic has pre-programmed these to poof-off after exactly one year. And of course they asked me to get it checked thru a repair centre. ( which as you all know is not free.) But I had a better idea --- the garbage truck comes every Monday to my apartment complex so I went and trashed it. THe lesson I learnt was - DON'T TRUS PANASONIC PRODUCTS BLINDLY. RESEARCH AND THEN GO FOR IT."
3,"What it does, it does very well. But...","...it loses 2 big points for only one reason, the way it handles MP3 discs. As mentioned in earlier reviews, I too was very disappointed to find a lack of MP3 display and control features with this player. So before you slip a fully loaded MP3 disc into this unit, you'd better print up a table of contents so you know that track 73 is Trapeze's Madusa, cuz all you're gonna get is a track number on the unit's front panel display. I really would like to see a unit that handles all the formats and disc types that this unit does AND when playing MP3s, give the user an on-screen view of the track info and the disc's file structure along with the ability to create playlists."
2,Unreliable DVD player,"We bought this player, our first DVD player, almost a year ago, and have had nothing but trouble. A few days after the 3-month full warranty ran out, it started freezing while playing a disc, and we would then have to turn it off and wait several hours before trying again. Eventually it stopped running altogether.... And it still isn't working...."
1,Be Careful,I researched the product before purchase and have owned Panasonic products without incident. 11 months of trouble-free use at a reasonable price. Then an HO2 error lead me to take a look around (try Panasonic DVD H02 on Google). See for yourself; this is far from uncommon. I'm off to the repair shop - I'm not hopeful but if Panasonic wants my $ again they better step up to the plate.
1,Was great....while it lasted.,"Great machine for the money, if you want a disposable player. Worked fine for 7 months, then the dreaded H02 error. Cost to fix is almost what a new one costs. ..."
3,More on the Dreaded H02 Error,"The suggestion of restarting the player by gently pushing the disk clockwise worked fine. It seems, however, that the problem is not a defective motor but a bad case design. Any weight or pressure on top of the unit can result in contact with the top of the spindle and friction that shuts down the drive. Our problem appears to have been solved by moving the player on top of the VHS and placing a spacer inside the case to maintain adequate clearance. Better than throwing it away but still an annoying design flaw."
1,Yet another HO2 victim,"This is a 5 star machine until the warantee runs out, then you become an 'HO2' victim, never again to play another DVD with this machine. Buy another machine from another manufacturer."
2,problem after 15 months,"I had no problems with it ... until now where suddenly it jsut stopped working.I think there is something wrong with the reader since, it cannot read any of my dvds anymore.Not even the disc cleaner which is suppose to have an audio. It displays that ""the disc cannot be played"" when I've played that same dvd in it before. ...the warranty doesn't cover it anymore (only 1yr..."
5,Easy - Just the way I like it,"I have always been a fan of Panasonic. Generally, their equipment works out of the box, is stylish, easy to use, and lasts forever. Right now I'll settle for the first 3 out of 4. Installation was a breeze, and it is a good looking unit.Video quality is amazing, and it plays my MP3's perfectly. Honestly, I don't know how anyone would pay more if you can get a Panasonic for this price...If you're in the market for a mid range DVD, just get the Panasonic. It does just about everything and price/quality ratio can't be beat."
5,Watching SVCDs,"Blank CDR's cost 50 cents. Blank DVD-R's cost $12. And if you consider the cost of the recorder, CDRs is the most economical way to make home videos. To get near DVD quality, one has to burn Super Video CD (SVCD). Like DVD it uses the MPEG-2 format.Nero Burn program has this capability.Watch your video production on DVD players that support the SVCD format. I tried several DVD players (Sony, Apex, Phillips, Panasonic). The Panasonic models I tried (the RV31 and RP56)supports this SVCD very well including the regular DVD. In addition, it also plays Karaoke formatted CDs and MP3s. the other Vendors DVD players skips or wont play SVCD at all."
2,Panasonic DVD-RV31K DVD-Video Player with MP3 Playback,"it's was good machine until it freeze on some DVD, the first one was terminator2, and it freeze again on tom raider, I send it to panasonic and they made an upgrade, I try it and it freeze again on dithy harry series. My sellers told me that i was the one he see who has this kind of trouble with this machine. One of my freind has the same and he don't have trouble."
2,H02 error,"Has been an okay player for the last couple of years, but stopped reading disks last night, the common H02 error. Read through other reviews for suggestions, removed the cover and tapped the white plastic button in the middle of the disk support mechanism- now it plays again! I'd rather watch a movie today than go to Transistor Town anyway. Vive le internet!"
2,Don't buy!,"I'm giving it two stars only because mine lasted about three years before it quit and gave me the ""H03"" error code a couple days ago. It worked fine while it lasted, but judging by the large number of complaints about this same issue it's obvious it's a defective design. I took the top off mine and nudged the white disk inside and it at least temporarily fixed the problem and allowed me to finish watching my movie. I guess I can live with taking the top off to fix it occasionally, but as soon as it starts quitting all the time I'll trash it and get a new one.Update - it lasted three more months since the initial H03 error then died for good. Time to shop for a new DVD player."
3,HO2 Error frustration and fix,"I followed the suggestion of tapping the disc holder and it worked! If you were like me and shook the crap out of the machine, this might fix your problem. When you take off the housing, you will see the DVD reader at the back center of the space. You will notice that the disc mounter that picks up the disc is not very sturdy. I gave it a few moves and tried it a couple of times before it picked it up and started reading the disc. Works fine with original DVD's, but got H07 with burnt DVD.Needless to say, I was going to throw it out before I read the thread about this suggestion from Amazon.com Customer. I hope this works for others out there that have not thrown the thing in the garbage. I was using a Daewoo DVD POS, it sucked so I went online to see if I could fix(?) the player myself. It's still going, I haven't put the screws back in though.GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!"
1,RIP 12/25/01 - 7/5/03,"After i got this dvd player, i absolutely loved it. I thought it was so much better than watching DVDs on my PC. I even thought this DVD player operated so much more smoothly than other DVD players i've seen in action. I can't remember ever being so happy with a piece of electronics...Now 18 months or so after purchase, i too got the dreaded H02 error. The machine just [stopped working].I was in denial, wondering how such a wonderful machine could just quit on me. However, after reading all these other similar experiences, i'm quite peeved with Panasonic.On the bright side, i now have an excuse to get a DVD/home theater system. Hello Philips."
1,Another Failed Unit,"We've owned this unit for two years, and it was a workhorse during that time. But, like the other reviewers, I bought this player to last much longer than two years. Heck, I have a boombox that is 21 years old and still plays tapes and radio just fine, not to mention our 13-year-old VCR which shows no signs of slowing down. Oh, and our 13-year-old RCA TV set... still looks great.My point here is that Panasonic should offer some kind of refund to owners of this player. Two years of life is ridiculous in this day and age."
2,"Great player, short lifespan","I bought this player based upon the stellar reviews posted herein and at (...). The player worked terrificly for the first four months (exceptional audio and video on our standard 27"" TV). However, after 4 months, it started freezing up randomly more and more frequently until it doesn't play DVDs at all. Occasionally, it gives an ""H02"" error before it freezes (as alluded to by several other postings for this player at Amazon).When I called the Panasonic repair center, they were very discourteous and rude and told me to send the player and $90 to have them fix it (with no estimated return time). I've decided to purchase a different brand instead.Bottom line: there are an inordinate number of people in this forum outlining this same problem with this player after a few months of use. Also, the warranty period for labor is a very short 90 days. I suggest that the model design may be defective and that potential buyers stay away."
2,It was fine .... until it stopped working!!!!!,"I bought the player in Sep. 2001 and it was easy enough to operate. I'd say we watched about one DVD every other week on it so it has definately not been overworked.Well, it just died on me while watching the Matrix. I get the error code H03 and called the CS number. She told me where I could get it fixed and all I had to pay for was labor!!!Are you kidding me, I might as well just buy a new player.When I asked her how I would get my disk out she had no answer.I guess a 5 month life span is just long enough to get you past that 90-day-parts-and-labor warranty."
4,Great DVD but you need extra equipment for older TVs.,"I recently bought this DVD player and it is very simple to use and very inexpensive. The only complaint I have so far is that there is no coaxial cable input/output. If you have an old TV, it might only have a coaxial input(like a cable TV wire). If this is the case, you will need to buy a RF modulator [amt] so that you can plug the DVD player's video, audio-L, and audio-R cables to your TV. I read complaints about people getting ""H02"" errors after six months of use but the instructions manual explains how to fix those errors."
2,Worked fine until 2 weeks after labor warranty ended,".....then I got the H02 error code.A call to Panasonic and I find out the repair cost will bealmost as much as what new units are selling for these days.I thought I had a lemon until I saw all the reports of this error code on the web. Straight out and out design flaw by Panasonic.The motor won't spin the CD/DVD and when it does, there are dropouts.The customer support team is clueless and I even had one rep tell me he always buys extended warranty coverage....that says alot for Panasonic reliability on this player."
4,"Good, basic player","I have the RV30. I got it from Amazon last November and have had ZERO problems with it. I have only watched movies with it (and accessed special features of them), but it has performed flawlessly. The remote is easy to operate. I recommend it."
4,Well designed,"I use this for the bedroom 20inch Sony TV without external speakers. One of the first things that impressed me was the sound quality afforded by the TV's small speakers with this player. The surround sound option literally projects the sound out into the room. Sound effects like I'm only used to hearing on a home theatre system are discernable with this player. It also has a powered subwoofer output, which tempts me to buy one for this TV. Since I'm using it with just a 20inch monitor, there's not too much I can say about the picture quality: it's fine. The remote control is intuitive and easy to use (I found myself reaching for reading glasses every time I wanted to use the Philips remote for another machine). I've had no trouble playing disks, even badly scratched rentals. This player has a memory feature that allows you to resume play on a single disk after turning off the unit. This took a couple tries to figure out (not that intuitive), but I use it often."
2,H02 - Mee Too but a fix mentioned worked.,"I too have fallen victim to the H02 error. I've had the player about 2 years using it often (me love movies). For no reason, out of the blue, I started receiving the H02. But I tried a fix mentioned in another review and it worked. I opened the case, tapped and spun the ""white dot"" and now it's working. Still [is bad] I had to do this in the first place but good news is it's working so far. Of course now this gives me an excuse to buy a new, better, player so it's all good."
2,Worked great during first year and then became a H02 victim,I brought this 13 months ago and really loved it until I experienced the H02 error like other people do. I followed the H02 solution posted by other people and it began to work again.Don't buy this player coz it won't last long and it 's not worth your $$.
1,H03 Corrected,Hi-My previous review stands: don't buy this product. However after the receiving the H03 I needed to rescue my imprisoned DVD. None of the suggested reset procedures remedied the situation. Using a tip from another reviewer I whacked it on top a few times and suddenly it seems to work again. I am happy for now but this just delays my inenvitable Sony purchase.
1,Dies after one year!,"The unit worked really well until I got the ""H02"" error after about one year. This failure is so common that it seems obvious that Panasonic dumped a known defective product on consumers rather than deal with the economic consequences of recalling these units. Very disappointed!"
1,Nice......when its still working!!!,"I thought it was a good DVD player until recently. However it now says NO PLAY for any disks I put it. I'm glad its still under warranty, but I feel bad for those whose warranty has expired. I'd recommend NOT buying this product, unless you can get it for around 100$"
5,Just amazing... I think!,"Well, this is my first DVD player and I absolutely adore it. No problems, a lot of features, sounds great, a very good price... what more else can I say. I looked at reviews, specs and prices for about a month before deciding to buy, and I'm glad that I got this one."
4,DVD-RV31K,"I went to shopko to buy a cheap player, and they had this one. I brought it home plugged it in, and it blew me away. I was amazed at the picture quality even on a 7 year old Bell and Howell TV. I think the the 100x scan feature is a big plus, for finding scenes. The analog audio out is excellent.In summary, i would highly recommend this player for anybody looking for a first time player...Earl"
2,Problem after 90 days,"After 3 months, I started seeing the ""freeze"" problem with this DVD player. Furthermore, when playing CD, I can't forward/rewind within a song."
1,false advertising,"I received only disc 2, episodes 7-10, of the 'complete' second season. I was received a refund and re-ordered another set. I am awaiting its arrival, so hopefully it will be the complete second season this time."
4,very funny,"Amazon is great,product was packed & shipped perfectly.Videos were very funny,Flight Of Conchords from HBO series with the same name.Order both seasons and enjoy the show."
3,"Not like the first season, the second is just ok.","My brother turned me on to the Flight of the Concord's first season. I must have watched the first season more than eight times always laughing at their deadpan humor. I liked their songs so much that I bought their two CD's which has some of their live performances. But I have to say that I was very disappointed with the second season. Their were some good laughs but not like the first season. I'm not abandoning Flight of the Concord, I'm still very eager to see season three with great hope for their comeback."
4,Not as good as the first...but still up there,"Flight of the Conchords, Second season was not as good as the first season and I couldn't get into the songs as well, but it is still worth watching. There were a few episodes that were in the style of the first, but a few were also a little harder to enjoy as much. But I would still say that it is worth watching and I am still looking forward to a third season."
3,Severe disappointment,"I was a HUGE FoTC fan when season 1 came out. I first heard their music on some of the albums, bought the albums, and then watched season 1 on DVD (I don't have HBO). Season 1 had my laughing the entire way through. I was really excited for season 2 but it just wasn't very funny. Murray was hilarious as usual, but it seemed like all of the season 1 episodes were created around songs that had already been written...and the songs were clearly hilarious. Season 2 seems to be the exact opposite -- the episodes were written and then songs were written specifically for the episodes. The songs were not funny and if they were performed live (and thus out of context) then they would be downright awful.3 stars for Murray being his usual awesome self."
5,Great comedy!,"I found this show on HBO, and immediately was hooked! Starring two New Zealanders trying to make it as musicians in NYC, the plots are combined with their music to bring a different ""presentation"" to the standard comedy show. It is filled with humorous situations. Overall, an excellent show to watch!"
3,funny but too short,This season is really funny but there are only 10 episodes total. I felt a bit ripped off - I want more Conchords!
2,Epic Fail,"The first season was brilliant, causing Conchords mania in America. But the second season falls short. It's boring for the most part; I almost couldn't sit through many of the episodes. The jokes are weak and the songs are lame. Maybe they should have taken some more time developing the music, plots, and jokes. Don't even bother buying this season on DVD. It's a waste of twenty bucks."
4,"""Keep calm... jump out the window"" ...","Not sure what is up with all the bad reviews. Still a funny unique show, better than most shows even on a less successful episode. Glad that Jemaine, Bret, and Rhys got another season. Maybe they used up a lot of ideas the first season but I still enjoyed the Austrailian girlfriend Keitha, Epileptic dog benefit, Jemaine selling himself in the street, guys discovering hair gel, and their final tragic downfall.Favorite songs amoung the parodies ... should be dance floor classic ""Too Many Dicks On the Dance Floor"", the dead on synth pop video ""Fashion is Danger"", the sensitive rap track ""Hurt Feelings""."
5,One-of-a-kind,"It's natural for people to compare releases by the same artist, and often people tend to cling to the style that first attracted them to that artist - in this case, Flight of the Conchords Season 1. I see a lot of people claim that Season 2 falls short of reaching Season 1's greatness, but I disagree. They're both among the best things television has to offer (and incidentally I prefer Season 2!). Thanks Bret & Jemaine!"
1,Arrived broken,"My product arrived broken. I was so excited to receive it and heard the dvds and plastic pieces loose inside the box. There are scratches on the DVD and the plastic box has broken pieces. What kind of person packs a DVD set into a white plastic envelope with absolutely no protection and expects it to ship in one piece? I'm extremely disappointed. Not only that, the first season I bought from Amazon came in a small box, in one piece."
5,Rocks the party!,"Season Two ""rocks the party"" as much or more than Season One! A brilliant masterpiece!"
1,What happened?,A few good episodes... but then... what happened? The first disc is okay at best. The second disc is kinda painful.
5,"you either love it, or hate it","Flight of The Conchords... what can i say? You will either LOVE this show, think its some of the funniest stuff you've ever heard in your life, OR, the comedy will fly right over your head and youll think this show is stupid... its not!! The absolute funniest show ive seen in awhile! The songs can get a little tiresome sometimes (but thats only cuz i cant stand musicals!), but if you actually listen to all the words, even the songs are wonderfully hilarious!!!! i suggest giving this show a good try, if you think it great, WONDERFUL!!! If it flies over your head.... that sucks...."
5,great program!,My 5 year old was just excited watching the video! All the poses were just right of little kids to do. My little one insisted to watch it day after day for a week! The video also introduced the basic terminology in yoga - which he could now understand whenever he'd heard them on TV!
2,My kids didn't like it...,"My kids (ages 2 & 4) were bored with this dvd. They enjoy doing my yoga tapes much more. The feel of the dvd was like--""okay get on with it!"". I agree with a previous review about the handstand. That's the last thing I need my kids trying when I turn my back or leave the room for a second. I think the dvd in general is just okay, but definitely not for my family."
2,"light on yoga, heavy on boring messages","I bought this DVD for my 3 year old and I to do yoga together. I was very disappointed--so much of the program is little vignettes about nature, animals, etc., with just little snippets of actual yoga poses. Would have loved to have seen more fun/direction about the poses themselves than the environmental messaging. Don't get me wrong, I'm a tree hugger, but it was a bit much. Also, you can tell it was produced at least ten years ago. Everything's pretty dated..."
2,"Cute, but too fast","My kids really like the *idea* of this video, but the transitions between poses are so fast they can't even begin to keep up (and I can't either!)I suppose it is a good introduction to the poses, but in terms of a video you can follow to build a practice for little ones, it's not very helpful."
3,Yoga Kids: For Ages 3-6,this video is ok... I have used it for ages 3 to 5 and have found children at these ages would either like more instruction on how to do the poses as well as learn more poses or would rather more capturing animation related to popular kids movie stories such as the Disney series...
1,Where's the Yoga????,"I must admit, my 2 year old daughter enjoys watching this video. But mostly she just wants to watch it. Everyone's description is accurate with the ABC descriptions but I figured there would be a ""Cat Stretch,"" ""Down Dog"" or ""Warrior"" or something to do with yoga. Instead she acts like they are driving a car, hot air balloon or a worm. They don't even keep the letter on the screen, so it's not helping with learning the alphabet either. I think there's one pose that's an actual yoga pose. I was hoping to do yoga with my daughter. This is NOT it."
2,Not what I expected,"Too much talking, not enough yoga. I think it was actually hard for my 3yr daughter to keep interested because the flow kept stopping. It only teaches a few moves but it only does each of them once and spends most of the time showing the kids in the back yard or at the beach, petting goats or looking at the ocean. I will try to find a better DVD for my daughter."
4,Even good for a 2 year old,"I was looking for a way to introduce yoga, which I practice, to my 2 year old in a fun way. This is a great DVD. My 2 year old loves it - although there are some slower spots in the dialogue where I fill in and keep her interest but she is excited to do all of the poses all the way through. It will definitiely keep us doing yoga together for years to come."
1,Only gives demonstration of pose,"I bought this video to help my hyper 3 year old learn how to slow down and relax. This video has the children do a pose while the narrator, Mrs. Yoga discusses the specific pose. The pose last only a minute then the video moves on to fast moving, very distracting scene or animal to introduce the next pose.My child started out doing well and then...the fast pace and variety of animals got him going again and apparently it is more entertaining to run around like a lion than to keep switching gears and slow back down for the next pose. We've tried to watch it several times and have not made it past the fourth pose.I would not recommend this video"
3,"Okay, but too much talking in between poses","We enjoyed this, but there is a little too much explanation between poses. This might be fine for a 6 year old, but not for a 3 year old. I wish they just did the poses with less talking."
2,Such a disappointment,"I was expecting this DVD to have an actual yoga routine, albeit a simple one. My 3 year old daughter and I were both disappointed. There is absolutely no routine and the few yoga poses that are practiced are interspersed with dated songs and video clips. The video quality is poor, the routine is nonexistant, and the overall vibe is very dated. Coming from Gaiam, I assumed this would be a quality DVD. Unfortunately I was wrong. I wish I had paid more attention to the negative reviews and not gone with it just because of the brand. I'd recommend doing more research and finding a more quality DVD."
3,"nice introduction to yoga, but LACKS DIVERSITY",my 2 year old daughter enjoys watching & doing the simpler poses. & it is so sweet to hear her singing 'Namaste' softly to herself as she drifts off to sleep...but shame on the producers for not having more children of color in the video.
3,"Cute but a little too ""New Age"" for our family","My boys often see me working out at home to various DVDs, including yoga. My four year old (who is still at home with me during the day) often attempts various exercises, but quits when the grown-up routines get ""too hard"". I bought Yoga Kids to encourage him with exercise at a child's ability level.Yoga Kids was definitely kid-friendly. The catchy songs and animal shots were entertaining and kept my son's interest. The poses were not too difficult and I could tell he was enjoying the fact that he could do most of them.I really would have liked the DVD if it weren't for the uncomfortable spiritualist ""yoga theology"" infused throughout it. I'm sure it would be subtle to some people, but I just can't get used to the idea of my kid sitting cross-legged in a meditative position chanting ""Om"".Call me a traditionalist, it's just not for me."
2,Buy the Vol 2 & 3 Bundle Instead,"I bought the second and third volumes as a set, and we love them. Therefore, I thought the first would be equally as good, but I was disappointed. There is little interaction from Marsha (aka Mrs. Yoga) and the order is kind of random. Most of the poses are in the other two volumes as well. This one does have more songs; that was the only benefit for us. This DVD seemed more like a rough draft. The next two are a much better, finished product."
2,Yoga kids,"I found this video to be disappointing. It mainly just goes from pose to pose without much ease in transition. Also, the music isn't very inspiring for children.Although it did spark the interest for my children they weren't ga-ga over it. They prefer my grown up yoga video's to this kid's one(my children are 4 & 7)."
2,Slow Moving.....,"I bought this DVD for my 3 year old hoping she would take an interest in yoga early on. I was very disappointed. It is very slow moving so it does not hold her attention. The references back to nature are helpful, but I just wish it moved at a little bit of a faster pace. She has other exercise videos that she follows well, but this one appears to just make her sleepy and bored."
4,A good beginning for kids doing yoga,"I have three kids...a girl who is 5, boy who is almost 3 and a 6 month old. I bought this a year ago but they weren't into it. Just tried it again and they LOVE it. It's the perfect intro for them to yoga. The baby loves watching the other 2 do the poses with this video, so it's good for all of us. The 3 year old just quit taking naps but I want to encourage quiet time, so...YOGA! Good simple poses, some silly stuff and they are learning about yoga. I will get another DVD to switch up so they don't get bored, but for now this is a great way for them to have quiet time and hopefully get hooked on yoga like their mom. Once they learn these poses I will try to help them learn that they can work on perfecting them to get more out of it. Now I will look into those kids yoga mats!"
2,Not fast paced enough,"I bought this for my son who is almost three and he can definitely do many of the poses and follow along with the video however it is not fast paced enough for his age and he loses interest after about 15 minutes. There is a lot of talking between poses about the practice of yoga and the environment, etc none of which an almost three year old cares about. I would not really recommend this video for very young children- it is definitely better for a 5 and 6 year old. I am hoping to find a better one out there for him."
2,Yoga Bust,"My toddler wouldn't give it a second glance. She is a three year old that has sat through an entire three hour concert but didn't make it through the opening of this video. I liked it. However, I have no intention of roaring through yoga excercises without her. It may be good for older children. It just doesn't have that umph that catches younger children's attention."
2,Mostly an educational dvd.,"If your kids have never seen yoga, this is a good intro dvd, there is no sequence of moves, just an intro DVD that lasts about 30 minutes. My kids watched it once and then never again. I'm sure that are lots of better choices to invest it!"
4,yoga is fun!,"i'm a child care provider for mostly 2-3 year olds. i bought this dvd to give us something fun and different to do as a group, and the kids love it! several parents told me that when the kids went home, they were making their parents do yoga, too!my one dislike about this dvd is it seems to be a bit too slow-paced for my kids... tho it is geared for 3-6 year olds, so maybe they'll have a better attention span in the future.all in all, a great and fun way to be active with kids. i will definitely buy more in the YogaKids series."
1,Defective dvd...poor pressing?,"I ordered two copies of this dvd-- one for our daughter, and one for a gift for a friend's child. Our copy was unwatchable and actually stopped playing. This prompted me to check the second copy, which was also defective, and began skipping at around the same point in the recording. After returning both dvds, I'm going to order the Yogakids A-Z dvds instead and will hopefully have better luck this time."
5,wow this cd is very cool.,This band fragments of unbecoming reminds me alot of old in flames and a band called rapture.there guitar work blows me away its very intricate.
3,Great!,"Great melodic metal (swedish metal) album. The production is flawless, you can distinguish every instrument. Drumming in excelent as it is the guitar section. The acoustic guitar stuff really spice up the album. The booklet doesn't come with the lyrics but the CD cover is superb... maybe I have to check their website for the lyrics. Recommended to any metal enthusiast!"
4,A Jew in Nazi Germany,"This is the second in the series of 3 volumes of the diaries of Victor Klemperer, a Jewish Professor who lived in Dresden with a non-Jewish wife during Nazi rule. It is undoubtedly the best perspective on what it meant to be a jew at the time. ""I will bear witness"", he repeated several times throughout his diaries. And so he did. It is also remarkable as an essay in human psychology, viz-a-viz the after-war period in Communist Germany. He distrusted West Germany for fear of a return of fascist beliefs; an opinion shared later by the British Prime Minister & French President, both of whom tried, privately, so we are told, to talk Gorbachev out of allowing German reunification. So there was reason in his decision, apart from personal motives regarding his prospects. I found his diaries a read that added substantially to my knowledge of humanity in authority and out-of-it."
1,bad product,"I agree with the other reviewers who have been disappointed with this product. The heater gives off a very sharp burning plastic smell, even after repeated usage. It does not provide much heat if there is any wind at all. Look elsewhere."
1,don't buy this item,"I purchased this item for my patio. I had to return 2 of them due to being damaged in shipping. The one I kept was still damaged but not as bad. I began to burn this item and was annoyed by the smell that this gives off. Its a burning plastic smell. Now, the black tower coating is flaking off. Please save your money and look elsewhere..."
3,"Informative, helpful, not elementary","I enjoy reading Mark McCormack's books. On Negotiating was enjoyable, and provided some helpful things for me to think about and put into practice. However, if you were to buy only one book on the subject of negotiation, this would NOT be the first book to buy. Fisher, Ury and Patton's ""Getting to Yes"", or Cohen's ""You can negotiate anything"" are better books to begin with. Either of these books treat the reader more as a beginner and provide a more fundamental discussion than Mark McCormack's book."
4,Street Smart solutions on Negotiating,"Mr. McCormack is as experienced as they come.The book (like his others) is easy to read and full of gems.However, He is much more capable in Sales and Management. Delightful book nonetheless.I also recommend; You Can Negotiate Anything by Herb Cohen."
5,"So far, so good.","I just purchased this book, it seems pretty good so far. I have found some typos but otherwise it seems real good and easy to understand. A review book like this has been well awaited. Good job."
4,A great game pack,"This game pack includes something for everyone. There is a NASCAR game, which allows you to race as if you were in the drivers seat; a Solitair CD that includes more versions of solitair than you know what to do with; A bass fishing game with multiple locations and hooks to fish with; Lords of the Realm II, a game that allows you to build up armies and fight; 3D Ultra Pinball with multiple exciting level with multiple players; You Don't Know Jack, a *very* fun and funny trivia game; Ceasar II, which allows you to make and rule entire cities or kingdoms. Like I said: this game pack has something, or many things, for every one. It's a great buy."
1,Sounds from theTwilight Zone or Outer Limits,"I don't know how else to describe this CD. There's very little that is sung by Bing, and much of what isn't Bing is very strange sounding stuff. I have to say it sounds like Christmas music you might hear in an episode of the original Twilight Zone or Outer Limits television shows.After owning it for a year or two I realized Christmas music should be something you *enjoy* hearing. I finally tossed it today."
1,Very Disappointing,I found the endless round of interviews not at all helpful. It is no surprize to any competitve swimmer that attitutde is critical. I was sufficiently disapointed in this book to return it.
1,NOT what I was expecting - misleading title,"Maybe I should have read the other reviews more closely, particularly the one calling this an ""historical treastise"" because that it most certainly is. Definitly NOT the book on technique and strategy that I was hoping for and was led to believe by the other reviews and the book's title.It is a great big long book on the history of swimming, maybe the other reviewers have more time on their hands for general reading.There are transcripts of long conversations for pities sake. Oh well - the pitfalls of buying online I suppose, hmmmmm, who can I offload this onto?"
5,The best set of Oracle cards I have ever used!,"When I fist got my Goddess cards I was intriged by the art. I ordered them on line and didn't get a good look at them. I was amazed at how life like the cards look. Some of the clothing is a bitt goofy looking, like the goddess' Elen's dress of ferns. I was even more surprized when I did my first reading. I used one of the lay out provided in the book. It was teh one called Brighid's Arrows. It was right on the money. I don't even get reading that good with my Tarot cards. I would recomend this for any one who wants to get the kind of advice only a mother could give from and oracle."
4,Glad it is available online,"What can I say? I like the product and can't get it anywhere else. Even though I live in New York, it is not available in any of the stores I used to buy it in the past. Would be nice if the 3-pack was available, but I take whatever I can get."
5,Soy Granules - with Yogurt/Strawberries & Honey,"I have been buying this at Fresh Fields... they don't carry it anymore. It is a wonderful and healthy addition to my favorite lunch of fruit, yogurt and honey. I am delighted to find it available for purchase!"
1,SORRY,THESE BRAND ARE SORRY. CAN'T RAP WORTH NUTHIN? THESE DIRUS ARE RAPPIN AND AIN'T GETTING PAID. DAMU RIDA KILLAS! FORGET A SLOB FIGGA!
4,DRIVING GLOVES,"GOOD FEEL, NICELY MADE. THE THUMB SHOULD HAVE BEEN CUT A LITTLE SHORTER BUT THATS ON MY HAND. OVER ALL I LIKE THEM."
1,These gloves aren't good.,"I have a few pair of 1/2 finger gloves and they are all size large. I got these in large as well, but these are slightly small and very in-proportionate. They feel cheap, they look cheap. They are cheap. I bought these gloves cause they were reviewed decent and cheap, but I was let down. They are not very good. They are very bad."
2,"Short life-span, hoped for ""real"" leather","I used these gloves daily for 6 months. They did not fit properly, but I figured being leather they would stretch and eventually form to my hands.As I first began wearing these gloves, they stained my palms black (yes, stain. It required 2-3 hand washings). The fit was too tight in the area between the base of the forefinger and the wrist, but was too lose between the pinky and the wrist. Additionally the fingers were very loose (I could fit two fingers in a single finger whole). I'm not sure if these gloves were made with real leather. After sitting, they would harden and felt like plastic. Once warming to body temperature they did soften up, but after a few months began to smell likeSilly Putty.These gloves were finally ""retired"" when they wore through the palm and the stitched seems burst at the base of the forefinger. I am now tryingMen's Shorty Leather Driving Gloves (Fingerless). They seem to be better made, I'll let you know what I think in 6-months."
2,Poor choice for gloves,"AS soon as i took the gloves out of the bag i almost just put them back in the package and returned them. I bought the large size, generally a safe bet for average sized guy, and they fit like they were smalls. Also you could feel and see how badly they were stitched together, not just because they were small, but the seems were uneven from finger to finger. If they were priced for five or six bucks instead of 15, or whatever, the gloves would be a deal but they aren't that cheap."
5,Indulgent!,I received a small sample of this at Saks and had to go back for the full size. Turns your shower into a spa like experience. The warm menthol surrounds your senses and the fresh mint smell and soft lather combine to make you feel relaxed and pampered. It seems to work best in a steamy shower. The scent isn't overpowering at all. An indulgent product that is worth the extra money because you only use a small amount each time.
2,Was hoping for a more gender neutral eucalyptus scent.,"I love eucalyptus scented bath items so had high hopes for this product. The initial fragrance is strong and wonderful, but the minty scent doesn't last. Instead, I ended up smelling like a rather generic men's shower gel. The name of the product led me to think there would be some sort of warming sensation while using it, but, alas, there is not.The scent while in the shower is strong and sinus clearing. I love that part! I don't love smelling like men's aftershave once drying off."
5,Kick your butt,"This video is the toughest step aerobics video I own. If you do all the moves right you won't be able to stand by the end. Lots of squats and lunges make it ideal for leg and butt work. There's also a high impact component, a leaping and jumping aspect that keeps your heart rate up. The moves are fun and varies. The costumes and hair are very 80s, which is pretty funny, but the workout leaves me feeling stronger the next day."
5,Otoscope/Ophtalmoscope from Welch Allen,The diagnostic tool is excellent as it fits in my pocket. I liked it more instead of bulky devices that are not portable as this one.
1,I never got it,The item never arrived!I was very dissapointed. I contacted the sender and got a reply but they did not follow up on my case. I requested a full refund and will never order medical supplies or anything from them every again.Warning!
4,recommended,Delivery on time and also product received as described exactly on the picture.Excellent price.Fully recommended.
2,misrepresented,"I thought I was getting a middle of the line diagnostic kit, but when it got here, it turned out to be the ""pocket jr"". It should still work for my classes, but it's not the quality I was expecting and the model name/number certainly was never mentioned in the description. The light is blindingly bright and with no way to adjust it, I hope I don't cause any of my ""mock"" patients to become real patients as they trip over the furniture on the way out."
3,OK for the price,"Just received this so these are just first impressions.The otoscope works fine. I expected a little better quality from Welch Allyn. The lens is just OK, and of course has a fixed focus. (Wear your glasses or contacts while using.) The switch feels like it wouldn't endure heavy usage. The handle seems cheaply made with fair fit and finish. The head quality seems low-end and simple but decent enough to use regularly.I consider the opthalmoscope unusable due to the brightness of the light. I tried the light on myself from about 1 foot and it is unacceptable - and you really need to be closer to do a proper examination. Maybe I'll try some older batteries to see if that helps, but Welch Allyn needs to correct this problem."
2,Would be great if it was in perfect condition,"Overall, the kit had seemed good when I received it. However, 2 months later when I started using it in school and actually realized that it was broken (the opthalmoscope mirror was off, and the otoscope light bulb was cracked), I was past the warranty from Devine Medical and couldn't get a refund.Thankfully, Welch Allyn backs up their products, and offers a full warranty for med students, while we are students.Good product, bad seller."
5,Great product!,"This was a great choice. My bookstore only offered a larger, more expensive version. This is smaller, easier to handle, cheaper, works just as well, and is the envy of my classmates who spent too much money."
4,Can't beat it for the cost.,Unless you wanna drop $700 on a pan-opthalmic you can't do better than this for the price. Works as well as anything on a doctors office wall and very easy to stick in your little white coat. My friends who bought the bigger more expensive ones are jealous.
2,ok,"So I thought that it was a great deal. The otoscope works fine, but I feel as though the opthalmoscope doesn't really magnify..."
2,Not the original versions,"While I enjoyed listening to these songs, they are not the originals. They are either later recordings or they have been remixed to the point where there are noticeable differences from the original hits."
1,flex shaft review,The foot pedal pictured was not the pedal sent to me. The pedal sent was one I had already purchased and it does not work with the new model of the dremels and is therefor useless unless I am able to put a different plug adapter on it. The company did give me a refund but I still had to pay shipping and insurance . If the correct picture had been shown I never would have ordered it in the first place.
5,What a difference!,"I am giving this Circulon pan with the locking colander lid to my daughter-in-law this Christmas. I gave her a pan with a colander lid that locked about 2 years ago and the thing has just about fallen apart. I cannot wait to see her face when she sees this one! I have Circulon pans also, and got her ""hooked on them"" about 5 years ago also. But the lid on this is beautiful and the locking mechanism and durable handles will make her so happy that I am very anxious for her to see (and get to use) this one! I know the old one will be in the dumpster immediately after she receives this one!"
3,Just Ok,There is a lot of weight to the silver and stones a good quality too but the ring is not made well. The mold of the ring is very messy and uneven which makes the ring look fake and cheap... not worth the $50.00 I paid... it's going back.
3,a fine work of Indo-Canadian short fiction,"Although my libertarian American spirit rises up in indignation at the thought that Ahmad's talented writing was supported by a generous arts grant from the Canadian government, I must admit that the book is fine enough to stand on its own two feet without any help from Ottawa, and that I am also jealous and wish that I could get paid to write books down here south of the border. Ahmad weaves together a collection of postmodern, identity-laced stories that skip back and forth between past and present, India and Canada, dealing with traditional cultural themes as well as more adventuresome stuff like drugs, sex, student riots and going hunting for tigers. The evocative images of life on the subcontinent, as well as the wide range of characters, will hold the reader's interest -- the character of the ""opium eater"" being the most particularly haunting personality to grace the pages of this fine collection of stories."
4,"Great for actors, playwrites, or anyone who reads plays!","I would highly recommend this book. I needed it for a class and borrowed it from the library, however, after reading it found it so helpful I bought it from Amazon. It's written like he's talking right to you. He uses lots of examples, some of them are very funny. It's short and sweet and very informative. A great little manual to have on hand, I think! Buy it! It's not expensive!"
5,Voice,This guy has a great way of laying things out for you. Its not at all a boring read and for anyone doing theater this book helps in really diving deeper in to the actions that take place.
5,Required reading for anyone working on the stage!!,"I had a conversation yesterday in which the other theatre artist asked what approach this book advocated to script analysis:""is it feminist theory? queer theory? Marxist?""""No, it's the one where you read the script.""Seriously, I don't know what I was doing in the theatre prior to reading this book, and I am so excited to begin my next project now because I feel that I have so much improved in my grasp of how to read a play. Why I wasn't required to read this book in Intro to Theatre or one of my first design classes I don't know, but I am so happy that I did now."
5,Excellent and easy to read.,"I've been acting for ten years and got my first directing assignment. I know a lot about directing from having been directed, but this book was a great guide for script analysis with the big picture in mind, not just one character. The show was a success and the actors still like me."
1,Bad Design,"In a nutshell:1) The vacuum is very hard to push because the wheels have NO bearings. Just cheap plastic wheels.2)The belt that drives the rotating brush broke after only 4 uses. Now I'm waiting for replacements in the mail at $2.50 each. Many customers complain about this defect and had I known about it I woulod have never purchased this vacuum.3) Cleaning the large dirt cup and hepa filter is a MESSY, DIRTY job.4) I'm going back to my canister vacuum with disposable bags. They are MUCH easier to push and there is no messy clean-up."
4,Good and earthy,"I bought this when I was buying a variety of salts as a gift. I was enticed by the truffle. I gave this 4 stars because I thought it was ok, but my husband LOVES it. It's very earthy, and a little strong for me. But like I said, my husband loves it. So if you have a taste for truffle or like truffle oil you will probably really like this salt."
5,Excellent progressive rock!,"I love Marillion and this band takes their sound to a higher level. The vocals are outstanding and the guitar reminds me of Pink Floyd. Anyone thinking these guys are light weights doesn't know what to appreciate in a band. The guitar solo in "" The Visitor"" is breath taking. They are excellent and this album proves it!"
3,"Decent, but for Aveda, thought they'd do better","I love Aveda, but not this product. I have long, pretty hair, and I thought this would be fun for some volume. A saleswoman at an Aveda salon talked me into it. She said that she tends to ""mix it with other Aveda products, but that it also works great on its own."" I disagree!The stuff is sticky, and you get your hands messy trying to manipulate it to work. I have a friend who also has it, and we both used it twice (using it the second time because we chalked the first time up to our user inexperience with the product).I think there are other Aveda products out there that can do a much better job."
1,It stinks!,"I had so much hope for this product... I figured Aveda products wouldn't smell so harsh since it's supposed to be made with natural ingredients, NOT! It smelled so strong, that my eyes started to itch and water. I had to return it. The hold was okay, but nothing special. Too bad."
4,It's good,"I'm always concerned with whether any paste / gel will break my edges, but this one seems to work great and I still have my edges and a little bit goes a long way, plus it smells great too"
4,Beautiful thread vintage crochet patterns,"I admit I love crochet---almost anything crochet---but have a particular love for vintage patterns--whether yarn or thread. I purchased this book knowing it was an older book---but I am not one to overlook the beauty of the older patterns and the uses we can find for them today. Many patterns are open to interpretation by the fiber artistcreating them---you have the basic pattern and add your own creative touch. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys thread crochet, romantic touches in their home or as gifts for friends. Of course it isn't for everyone, but if you fall within the parameters mentioned in this review, you will be very pleased to purchase an older book for a reasonable amount and have absolutely gorgeous patterns for little cost! I love it!"
1,'...Here comes the choo choo',"This book attempts to combine a 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad' type storyline with cooking metaphors to explain accounting shenanigans. If an investor requires this sort of dumbed-down, story-book style to learn about the various methods companies employ to mislead investors, he would be better served letting a pro invest his money via a mutual fund. In order to analyze the financial statements of companies, it's necessary to read SEC filings which are aimed well above the fifth grade level where this book appears targeted. If an investor is not uncomfortable reading complex material, he would be better served by books from Charles Mulford or Howard Schilit."
2,If you have to....,"In my English class I am supposed to read an historical fiction novel each trimester. I have hated every single one of them, and even though this one is no exception, it is still one of the best, if you really want to read a good book, go under the fantasy section and get a book from David Eddings or Terry Brooks, leave the boring historical fiction to those people that just have to read it. Anyway, so if you have to...read it, but one thing is for sure, get it at the library, don't buy it."
5,It Touches the Soul,I read this book - it is lyrical - it spins marvelous images and is a personal story that touches the soul of its reader. I was amazed that it appealed to not only myself but also my fiance - he was impressed with the imagery.
5,inner self reflections,the book paints pictures with wordsthe pain - the laughter - the joy are all revealedyou can virtually feel and expereience every emotion expressed in this book
5,"Irish Music, baseball, and other things",John did a great job with the movie and a great job with the sounds track. It sounds great and blends baseball with Ireland.....Enough said.
4,Who would have thought,"Well as big fan of one of the BEST documentaries on Baseball ever made!!! I also fell in love with the music from the film as well.What an eclectic potpourri of Irish music. You have some wonderful instrumental songs like, ""There is no rain outs in baseball"" by Whiskey on Sunday...To the coolest ""sounds like the Pogues"" band, Neck, doing numerous tracks on the Record.My favorite song is by a band called ""The Riot"" called Hold on me, it truly rocks.I mean just as much as anyone would laugh at the idea that the Irish could play baseball...is the fact that a movie about JUST THAT could spawn such a brilliant soundtrack of top notch Irish Music...and hey You don't even have to like baseball to enjoy this record as well...however you do have to like the Irish!!! LOL"
3,Home Fires was OK,This is a true version of the old romance novels. It was just a story nothing really exciting but is was good. There was no mystery or suspense like you find in the novels of today.I did get mad because I could not believe that Terry let her no good ex-husband take money from her and he did not even support there child. And Mark's ex-wife would let her child suffer because she did not get what she wanted.It makes you wonder if there are situations like this that exist. I know they do.
1,no strings!!!!!!!!,when i saw this book I thought it would be great for my 3 kids since it came with 3 strings.. needless to say when my kids opened it up they were soo happy. when i told them it came with a string for each of them they destroyed the box looking for them. the look on their faces when there were no strings in the box almost broke my heart.
1,Where are the strings?!,Ok maybe I picked the paperback instead of the sprial bound. BUT why would I want a string games book without the strings?!?!?Now I have to search for strings to go along with this!!! YAY!Maybe I could just throw it in the garbage!
2,no strings,"the product description said it included strings but it didn't, very disappointed, had to pay twice what I planned because I had to order strings"
3,No Strings Included,"No strings included, only book received. I ordered this book for my granddaughter after reading other buyers reviews. Other buyers state they received either one or three strings that were included inside the book. The book sent to my granddaughter did not have any strings. The write up that amazon has does not state that the book comes with strings, but amazon does not always have complete descriptions of a product and I assumed this was one of their oversights in their description. If anyone else received strings with the book, I sure would like to know why they were not included with the book sent to my granddaughter. Very disappointed."
2,Very Confusing,"This book is so complicated! The illustrations are OK, but the text is terrible. My daughter (11) ordered this for herself and was excited to get the book. She has a Klutz book on string games that she loved (and played with for months!), so she thought this would be perfect to further her skills. She was very disappointed in this book. Here is an example of the text on page 15... ""Hook index fingers down over the upper far thumb string, then down on the far side and back up on the near side of the two lower far thumb strings. Catch the lower thumb strings and extend index fingers."" This step is from one of the figures classified as ""Easy"" and is the first string figure in the book."
4,"Difficult, FUN","My daughter has grown up playing string games so we thought this book would be perfect for her. The book was very good with a lot of different string games. (They have been listed by another reviewer so I won't list them out.)My daughter was 7 when we bought this book. She was able to do some of the easier string games without a lot of help. Some of the more difficult ones she needed help with and was unable to do them by herself.This is the kind of book where you learn one trick, work for a while to master it, then go back and try another one. If you try to sit and just work your way through the book all at once, I think you might find it moves in difficulty much faster than you might like.Well worth the money.Enjoy."
4,Good Product,"It was funny because with all the fancy, expensive gifts my daughter received for Christmas, this was her favorite. This was a last minute extra gift for my 11 yo for Christmas, and it was worth every penny."
5,String Games,"Sent as a gift, so can't rate that, except it looked good. I wish it would have had the colorful accompanying strings, but it didn't"
2,String games leaves strings untied,"This is not the book for a beginner. It does not explain things clearly, especially not for an 8 year old girl trying to learn string games for the first time. It is more suitable for someone already familiar with these games, but even then I was not impressed."
3,"Oh dear, no strings attached!","I was so confused by this, because I too thought the string was included. This is just so annoying, as this is a gift and I only just realized the string is missing. (I thought it was in the box, but what I had seen was actually a piece of the packaging - learned my lesson there to slow down a bit when verifying contents!!) The other reviews I read prior to purchasing mention the included string, and I understand now that the reviews may have been placed with the wrong product. Argh!So, I've ordered the separate string which of course will arrive after Christmas. Double-Argh!!Looking through the book it does look a bit tough for a child, so I am a wee bit concerned about comprehension; but it does look fun and impressive. I had to give this a 3 because it appears to have potential...but I won't really know until the string arrives. :("
2,STRINGS NOT INCLUDED,"bought this book for my boyfriends 8 yr old daughter for christmas and im not impressed. first, no strings were included... at all! also the book is a little advance for someone who is not fimilar with 'playing' with strings. it needs a basic beginners section in my oppion. not at all what i expected. i did read the reviews and i wish i would of listen."
2,Too difficult for 8 year old,"Maybe a good book for someone older, but way to difficult for an 8 year old."
3,RIP OFF!!!!!!,"THIS ISN'T JOSEPH. I AM HIS OLDEST DAUGHTER.I am soooo MAD right now. This is just an Omarion/Bow Wow show. And I admit they were good (especially Khelo Thomas), but where the heck are B5 and Pretty Ricky? NO WHERE THAT'S WHERE!!!! THEY SHOULD HAVE FILMED THE D.C. CONCERT!!!Unless you like Bow Wow and Omarion, DON'T BUY THIS!!!"
1,Unless u like bowow or omarion DONT GET IT!,"Its only omarion and bowow, unless your like me who hates BOWOW cocky self, then you will hate this, or unless u like some of bowow songs. I got it and I hated it, SInce when did become the bowow omarion tour, Its called scream tour, there the only people on it!You'd think that Everyone on the tour would be on, but no! no B5, Pretty ricky or Bobby V. Unless u want to see bowow cocky self and omarion, buy it."
3,Good but not great.,"This is the weakest of the late, great Ronnie Lane's four solo discs. This is recorded without his fine backing band Slim Chance. Eric Clapton sits in on three cuts. Other guest musicians include Mel Collins, Ian Stewart, Alun Davies and Henry McCullough. Where there are some weaker cuts that just don't quite work there are some truly brilliant one's as well. Some of the stand-out cuts include Lad's Got Money, She's Leaving, Barcelona (co-written with Clapton) and Kuschty Rye. Still worth picking up but I would recommend you start with Anymore for Anymore, One For The Road or Slim Chance prior to this one...Simon"
4,Another GREAT Ronnie Lane album!!,"it's a shame there are so few reviews here for the Great Ronnie Lane's few studio albums. I don't think the man ever wrote anything I didn't like...While the production style of SEE ME is ever so slightly updated from his usual grassroots production style, the songs are in the same exact tone and style that we have become accustomed to in his other great works. Not a bad track in the bunch.Don't hesitate to add this one to your collection and be sure to spread the word on this often overlooked and master musician!!"
3,Bloodless account of the decapitation heard round the world.,"This is a fair, balanced, but too dry account of the trial and execution of Louis XVI. All the facts are there, but none of the drama. The book also suffers from the propensity to summarize rather than describe events. The author seems reluctant to delve too deeply into details, assuming we've all heard the story before. Thus the drama never seems to come alive; the whiff of the textbook hovers over its pages.On the positive side, Mr. Jordan has no axes to grind and maintains a scrupulous objectivity. Suprisingly, it is only Louis himself who has the power to elicit an emotional response, albeit restrained, from our author. Chapter four, his portrait of Louis' life in the Temple, provides a touching portrait of the King, enhanced by the inclusion of the famous sketch of the King in profile shortly before his death."
3,King Louis XVI,"It's hard for me to believe that there are few books on King Louis XVI in light of the French Revolution. This is indeed an interesting look at King Louis- Jordan uses narrative to play out the history of the French Revolution and its aftermath. It was a slow read, but well written."
3,not terrible,Jordan's book has several commendable points. His overview of the Revolution pre-trial is cogent and useful to newcomers. His portrayal of the King's last months are evocative and poignant. Jordan also gives a thorough account of all the various arguments employed during the debates. The narrative stumbles a little with his negative characterization of the Girondins and a laudatory one of the Jacobins as better caretakers of the Revolution. This despite the Girondins being sacrificed to the mob by the jacobins' fear and their subsequent government abandoning both Republican and Democratic legacies and embracing the totalitarian terror. Would the Girondins' moderation in retrospect really have had a comparable negative impact? His final chapter on the obliteration of Louis' remains is oddly joyful. maybe he should have written a hagiography of Marat. Overall worth reading.
1,American Train Journeys,I thought this would be a journey through America but instead it is focused on freight trains. There is one DVD included though on an Amtrak passenger train ride from Chicago to the west coast.
2,A bit disappointing...,"After hearing Rafkin on the Howard Stern Show I expected much more from this book. He was very funny and forthcoming in his interview with Stern, but it seemed like every interesting anecdote from the book was mentioned in the interview in full detail. He also jumps around too much - the way he goes back and forth in time is very confusing, even irritating. Overall, I would have to say that there was a lot of potential and very little is delivered."
3,"Some juicy tidbits, but as a whole it's a tad uneven.","I heard about this book on the Howard Stern show, and Alan Rafkin's candidness made me want to read the book. While there are some entertaining anecdotes, overall it's a collection of ""he's nice/she's not"" stories, pieced together with tales of his personal life. He's an interesting person, but I wish he would pick one subject and stick with it; Celebrity gossip or his three marriages."
2,Read Paul Mazurky's Book Instead,"Some of the other reviews posted very deftly critiqued the weaknesses of this book. I felt it was just poorly written and very much a first draft filled with surface anecdotes. Here is someone who had this amazing vantage point and the information he chooses to share with us seemed downright silly.Whatever...it did have its good parts. But few.I must tell you though...the feeling I walked away with after reading this book was pity. I felt sorry for him. He has almost no close interpersonal relationships with other human beings.Yes, he got to be present at the dawn of the TV sitcom era and contribute to it, but at the price of maturing developmentally as a human being. Decades of a workaholic pace has left him with a killer reel and many award statuettes but no intimate connections with people.The Mazursky book (Show Me The Magic) is warm, introspective, captivating, and revealing and offers much insight into Hollywood and the directorial process."
4,Good for a brief intro to the Dalai Lama and Tibet,"As a high school teacher, this worked great for an intro to some literature about Tibet. It shows some of the more humorous points about the Dalai Lama, and the students really started to dig him."
5,WOW!!! Glam-Slam Rock-n-Roll,"I was never a fan of PBF back in the day, but after listening to this, I can not for the life of me figure out why. This album is SOLID. The rockers R-O-C-K, and the ballads are... well, let's just say they don't remind me of Winger, and that's a good thing. PBF sound to me like a cross between Faster Pussycat (especially the vocals), Tuff, and LA Guns. The hooks in the songs (and I mean ALL of the songs) are on a par with Poison's ""Fallen Angel"" - if this had come out in '87 or '88 and the band had any gotten any media attention, this would be in everyone's collection. If you're into the Hollywood/Sleaze/Glam/Metal sound, get it now - it's that good."
2,It is ok. and I love Pretty Boy Floyd,"Its an ok cd But they have an entire new lineup, and they only have a few new songs on it, all the rest are covers from Leather Boys, that isn't right to make an album with material from an old album to the extent when the old material is 70 percent of the new album, if it was 1 or 2 songs it would be ok, but like 8 songs are from Leather Boys. And its got 2 good covers, but I still wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless you want to complete your Pretty Boy Floyd Collection as I do, and the new tracks on it are pretty sweet too. However due to recycled material, this is Pretty Boy Floyds' Worst album, they should have just made a greatest hits thing with new tracks if they were going to do what they did."
2,are you kidding me?,"Look, my man nomadic had the idea. Im an actual Gospel emcee, and more importantly a true Jesus freak with a yearning for growth in the word - and this album lacks much lyrical depth and even more spiritual content.... I was under the assumption that Gospel music was supposed to send out the good word of truth, this album has very little Biblical and spiritual reference. these artists focus too much on themselves and not enough on preaching the word of our Lord and Savior Jesus. Im not in the business of knocking fellow brothers in Christ - but i am in the hip hop business and i want listeners to realize that if they are satisfied with the message they have recieved from this album, then they might want to examine their thirst for edification."
4,Good for everyday use,"I use this product everday. I remove and replace my flashight from the holder at least 10 times a day. I bought the holder and quickly removed the rubber retainer strap. I am usually wearing goves which makes it hard to quickly unbuckle and remove the flashlight. The resistance the holder itself applies to the flashlight is more than adequate. I am climbing in and out of tight places and jumping up and down constantly. I have yet to have my flash light fall out. I like the fact that this holder doesn't use any type of nylon or velcro. Those types of holders only last me about 6 months, if I'm lucky. It also gives you the option to use it on a 2"" LEO tactical belt or a smaller dress belt. I've only used this one for about 2 months, but I've had absoulutly no problems. I recommend this product to anyone who needs a good quality holder for their flash light. Just make sure your light fits before you buy it."
4,Great holder for my Streamlight,"I bought this light holder at a local retail store. I removed the rubber strap almost immediately after reading some of these reviews. I love this holder. I carry it on my duty belt and have occasionally carried it on my regular belt when I am off duty. I plan to buy another so I don't have to keep swapping it. I use it for my Streamlight Polytac LED, which is the best light for the money in my opinion. This holder can be canted, but mine is straight vertical."
4,Good light holster,This light holster is well built. I feel it's a little bulky but not too bulky. It's strong and has held up to everyday duty use. I would recommend this item
2,Not very secure,The rubber retention strap broke shortly after put it on my belt. Using it with a Streamlight Strion(main) it falls out of the holster after a slight brush with anything; getting out of a car or jumping over fences. Using it with the Streamlight Skorpion(Backup)which has a rubber outer body it's more secure and doesn't fall out as easy.
4,Gladiator holder,"I Use this for my stream light strion. Fits great. The rubber band is removable if you wish, and holder seems to have good tension on the light alone."
4,measure your light per specs first,okay - i know many guys with this holder and its all 50/50 on their views of it. measure your light before you get it becase it will be hit or miss on if you like it.the small rubber retention strap will break within 2 weeks of use. 3 of by buddies and i all got this at the same time and 2 weeks was long longest of the 4 of us for it to last. mine broke after about 5 days. so dont count on the strap. i also had to remove the bottom rubber cup due to my light having ribs on the front that didnt allow it to fit. the cup pops out easily though so its all good.fits on my duty belt great but has adjusters for smaller belts too.i only gave a four becasue of the failed retention strap that i did really like b4 it broke (i now use a doubled rubber band that holds just the same). if they fix the strap issue and make sure the cups a bit more adjustable its a 5.basicly as long as u get a flashlight thats close to the blackhawk specs this product will work very well for you.
5,A New Religion,This CD has become my personal Bible. The Gospel According to Darling is a New Testament to the resurrection of the soul through the grace of an inner language spoken only when we resonate from our deepest spiritual place. Truely Heaven on Earth. Amen!
3,Bland uninteresting music,"I don't understand the rave reviews for this CD. The music is rather bland and insipid. I had just finished listening to the Beethoven late quartets before I previewed the Darling, so this CD simply paled in comparison. I suppose it would be okay as background music, but it is not a CD one would want to spend time listening to."
3,201 Unique Ways to Make Your Wedding Special,"Lots of ideas? Yes. Good, original ideas? NO! This is a great book because it is in a format that is easy to read and flip through, but I didn't use anything I read in there (I even reread it twice to see what I missed). I gave it three stars though, because there are so many ideas and hopefully they will be helpful to others. My only recommendation...get it at the library first to make sure it has something for you. Unfortunately, I bought it sight unseen."
1,Seriously useless information,"Unless you can afford to have your local confectioner make chocolate coins in the likeness of the bride and groom as party favors, or think a pottery weekend is your idea of a great bachelor party, forget this book. The suggestions in it are embarrassingly lame."
2,Not for beginners...,"I bought this video along with Power Yoga: Flexibility. My review for this one, Stamina, basically mirrors my review for the other. The postures are done very quickly, no focus on breathing. I'm returning both to Amazon. Very disappointed."
4,Good Read,Good Book. Jennifer Cruise is one of my favorite authors. I have re-read this book several times. Have recomended it to several.
2,Missing Crusie's normal spark,"It pains me to say that I actually wasn't very impressed with one of Jennifer Crusie's books. This is the first book by her that I haven't really liked. It wasn't horrible, but it moved so slow for such a short book. Basically the book is about Mae who needs to hire a PI to find her uncle's missing diary. She ends up hiring Mitch who isn't really a PI, but a stockbroker who took the PI job as a bet. Finding the diary was supposed to be one of the big mysteries of the book, but I actually didn't really care if they found it. While there were funny parts, it almost felt like it was forced in the writing to make the book funny. Mitch was an all right character, but lacked a thrill about him and Mae was boring at time. For some reason the book seemed flat without the usual spark Crusie's other books have."
4,What the Lady Wants,"I'm a big fan of Jennifer Crusie. All the books I've read of hers are entertaining and this was no different. It would have been better if I was a Sam Spade fan, but it was still a great read."
3,Early Cruise,"This was early Cruise about PI who gets hired to solve a murder of a rich-heiress uncle. Her family is crazy wonderful characters. This was not my favorite J. Cruise but this was fun story from her early days. If you were looking for standard funny and Entertaining Jennifer Cruise I would recommend faking it, Temptation or Bet Me instead."
4,It certainly gave me what I wanted!,"What fun read! Jennifer Crusie delivers another winner with What the Lady Wants! This is a great romantic mystery that cannot be missed.Mitch Peabody is a private detective who's working on the largest case of his career. Mae Sullivan -- femme fatale extraordinaire -- wants to find her rich uncle's murderer. Now Mitch has to investigate Mae's powerful and dangerous family. The case isn't a simple one, and Mitch is reluctant to probe further, but Mae's glossy good looks and tenacious nature don't facilitate things. There are some fun twists in the novel.What the Lady Wants is one of the most entertaining quick reads I've had in quite a while. This isn't exactly mentally stimulating, but it is sheer escapism and enjoyment. Perfect for the beach. Are you planning a vacation this summer? Take this sexy romp with you!"
2,I was not interested in the characters.,"The plot reminded me of a mystery ""who done it"" with questions, clues and suspects and the final culprit revealed at the end. I was not entertained and I wished it would be over. Sexual language: moderate. Number of sex scenes: two. Setting: current day U.S. Copyright: 1995. Genre: mystery romance."
4,Kooky supporting cast. Funny Farce.,"Mae Sullivan is looking for a schmuk--specifically, a dumb P.I. with testosterone for brain cells. Cynical Mitch thinks his fantasy Bridget O'Shaughnessy (from The Maltese Falcon) just walked in his door. SHE needed him to find a missing diary. HE wanted to put a lot of distance between himself & her wacky mobster relatives. BOTH had no plans of getting involved. I dropped 1 star bec. with the amount of fantasizing Mitch did (especially about The Maltese Falcon), it was a wonder how he got any work done."
3,not her best book,"I've read all of Jennifer Crusie's books. While it was a quick read, it was a bit anti-climatic. The plot was not thick enough to pull me into the the story."
4,This book was really a lot of fun!,"Both Mitch and Mea have a bit of a problem, they've modeled the life of a PI after Sam Spade's in A Maltese Falcon. It's really funny to watch them try to determine if they are playing out as Sam & Brigid.Mitch is doing his best to get his PI business in the black and only living off the income - not an easy feat. Mae is trying to figure out what has been going on in her home the last few months. Mae is a ward of her uncles. The one whose home she grew up in has just died and nothing is going well.This is the best of her books that I've read thus far."
3,What THIS lady wants is a good book!!!!,"I was very excited to start ""What the lady wants"" due to the fact that i have always adored Jennifer Crusie's writing.....this book, however, left alot to be desired for me. I found the plot to be rather dull and lifeless and found myself struggling to finish it. The plot dragged on and on and never gave any excitement. Better stick to some of her previous titles for total excitement."
5,It works,"I can't really say anything else about this product other than it works, Sony is a well known brand and the durability is there. If you need a memory stick give this one a go."
3,classic that isn't quite as fun anymore,"This game was a lot more fun when Windows was first coming out. The expansion was a nice addition though, and it really does add something more to the game. I suggest downloading the un official patch and gaining access to the other 2 classes as well."
2,hellfire (diablo add on),interesting idea...however cant play on the net with it...and thats 90% of the game there.
5,"Wonderful, even for unexpensive video editing","Yes, this card isn't the easiest to install and configure (most of it because you have to be VERY careful to plug the right connector in the right order to your monitors etc) but once it's done, you never have to re-configure anything. I have been using this to run 3 monitors and also 2 monitor + 1 preview (Photoshop, Premiere, etc). It's a wonderful card ! I just change for the much more expensive RT.X2 and let me tell you, the only difference is the RTX2 does real time acceleration preview. The Parhelia APVe even had more function and played video (avi to mkv) perfectly on my export monitor and home theater. I really loved this card and it's been my jump before going ""pro"" editing. I would recommend it but with patience required for the installation :)"
4,Seiko Rubber Watch Band is great,I love me Seiko watch! The only thing that is frustrating is that the rubber watch band doesn't last forever and I have to buy another one eventually.
3,Very Good,The Cd had very good songs and bad songs. There were more great songs tne bad songs. I owyuld buy it for everyone
1,Paint on the screw heads was peeling and chipped,"Seems like a fine product, but my order had chipped and cracked paint on the screw heads.The vendor provide a replacement with the same problem, then refunded the order.They must have received a defective batch. Sorry it didn't work out.I bought this product instead:7"" Gutter Screw Brown"
1,AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!!! DO NOT BUY!,"I have owned one of these heaters for about two years now. Went to light it last weekend and wasn't functioning properly, needs a new ignition assembly. Called Bernzomatic and they do not offer any replacement parts. I can't believe a company does not back up their product! I will never buy from them again."
1,BEWARE OF BERNZOMATIC,"I have owned a Bernzomatic heater for two years. I was happy with it until it started failing to stay lit. That's when I found out that Bernzomatic does not sell parts, nor do they offer refferals for service. I live near a large city but can't find anyone to service it and it's only one year out of warranty. I'm going to have to trash it and buy a different brand after only two years.Consider your purhase of a Bernozomatic heater to be much like that of buying a very expensive Bic lighter."
2,Great Concept but poor heating,"After much contemplation, I bought one of these and used it one night and basically had to hug it to feel any heat. I like the fact that the setup was easy and it is a very nice looking heater but it really didn't put out enough heat to keep me warm from 2-3 feet away. After I brought this home feeling very proud of my purchase, the first thing my wife says is that it's too low for the kids...duh! I didn't even think of that.I give this item only 2 stars because it does everything except what it's supposed to do.I returned it the following day citing ""disappointment with the heat output""."
1,Looks nice but doesn't work well,I too have the same problem with this heater as many of the other reviewers. Poor heat output and after 1 season the ignition switch is broken.
4,Wall art,"Yes I know, it is rather late for a calendar. But the pictures...... Monet is among my favourite artists and it is easy to remove the calendar part of the sheets - so buy this at a set of reproductions instead of a calendar and enjoy it for several years."
5,2 in 1,"The author is one of the premier Old Testament scholars of our time. This comprehensive commentary explores the historical and social world of Jeremiah and offers a theological interpretation of Jeremiah's work. Uses a combination of sociological and literary analysis to provide a fresh look at the critical theological issues in the Jeremiah tradition. This is a look that finally yeilds compelling insights into the message and significance of Jeremiah both for this tumultuous time in the history of ancient Israel, but also for our own complicated times. THIS IS THE COMBINED EDITION OF A 2 VOLUME COMMENTARY PUBLISHED EARLIER IN THE '90S."
5,Brueggemann Never Disappoints,"Professor Brueggemann has written an extremely helpful book for the wearied and busy parish pastor who chooses to jump into the prophet Jeremiah. Brueggemann always brings to light the issue or subject that most needs thoughtful attention. I recently completed a sermon series on the prophet Jeremiah and my copy of Bruggemann's book is highlighted, underlined, and has been heavily used. One may not always agree with Brueggemann, but one never leaves without having been educated and enlightened. Very helpful for the preaching pastor!"
4,Very Good,"Of the three books I used to prepare for the MAT, this was the most helpful. I felt confident at test time and did well. While the Arco book was a wasted effort, the Barron's guide was right on target. I strongly recommend this book for MAT preparation."
3,"Good tests, Sloppy Study Tips","There are two parts of this book, one entirely dissapointing, the other only slightly so.The test prep advice is almost entirely unhelpful and unoriginal. I flagged three pages with good advice on them, but most of the advice is not worth reading.The book does include a pretest and 10 practice tests, plus good vocab lists. The experience of taking and grading the tests in this book has definitely helped me prep for the test. However, the answer 'explanations' given after each test have virtually no explanatory power. I have had to look up explanation myself to almost every question I answered wrong.Also there are a few typos and some plain wrong answers given as right that make it hard to have faith in this book.I haven't taken the real test yet, and I'll update this review when I do to see if the guide was actually helpful. But I suggest buying another book with 10 practice tests, and maybe with better test prep advice."
3,Average Book,"It can only build on the knowledge that you have gained in your life. If you're thinking of getting a high score on the test, solely by using this book. It will not do."
1,No Help!,"I got a 19 & in 15 precentile on the test due to my study of this guiede, and Im upset! It didnot perpare me for the totale nightmare ofx the mat or the horrors of takeing it. This is a vary hard test and impossable to pass for regular student takers! The book make you feel it ok but it was no help. I dont recomend the test or this book if reading and studyng is somthing you dislike like me. Congrats to the lucky winers but most wont do so good!"
4,Good Prep -- If you take all the practice tests!,"This book provides a good overview of the MAT, how it is structured and what to expect in the way of questions. True, this same information can be downloaded for free from the MAT home site, but this book offers 10 complete practice tests -- more than I could find in any other MAT prep book. Sitting down and taking a practice test properly (100 questions in 50 minutes; no distractions; no cheating) every other day or so in the weeks leading up to the real MAT is the best way to prepare for the test and feel comfortable with the format."
4,best MAT book,"This is a ridiculous test that you basically can't study for -- but this book has more practise tests than the others. The test hasn't changed in 50 years, so there's no need to buy a ""new"" addition. But this one."
1,Wrong item!,"I ordered this product thinking it would like just like the picture. Well I guess not! The product I recieved matched the item number, but is a completly different item. That is absolutly rediculous! Why would I even order an item I had never seen? No what am I supposed to do, I purchased it as a gift!?!"
1,do not get this if your a buckley fan,"This must be a compilation put together for the yuppies.Tim definitely nowhere near how good he can sing.He sounds restrained and on best behaviour.'sefronia' begins to break away and about the best track- a good show case for how beautiful his voice is.The others-poor.This CD doesn't come near the similar ballards he sings on 'Live at the troubador' notably 'blue melody','chase the blues away', 'driftin' that are so damn moving.The rest of the album a better show case too."
4,This was pretty fun,"This is a really fun game. It is not half as fun as its predecesor Starcraft. I thought the campaigns were a little too easy, and that the whole game was a piece of cake. This is one of the better games I've played so I gave it 4 stars."
4,Remixes from one of France's finest,"Chateau Flight has I:Cube and Dj Gilb'r as members, both releasing for Versatile, one of the best French (and European) electronic dance music labels. Every new release from this outstanding label has a musical statement to make, and succeeds in pushing back musical barriers and frontiers.This is a collection of Chateau Flight's remixes for artists like Pavel Kostiuk, Psyco on da Bus, Seiji, Femi Kuti, Bebel Gilberto, Joakim Lone Octet, P'Taah, Peace Orchestra, and even Pierre Henry and Serge Gainsbourg. For those who know, this roster of names represent an all-star team of cutting-edge techno-breaks/future-jazz scenes, and need no further analysis. For those who don't know, expect an idiosyncratic 'techno-edged' interpretation of a variety of different music styles, ranging from soul, afrobeat, and bossa nova, to deep house, leftfield electro-pop, and drum'n bass."
2,"Great Book, TONS of errors.","As I progress thru this book I find myself spending more time trying to figure out if the books right or wrong. This is very harmful to the learning experience as I would expect the book to contain very few errors!At only the end of chapter two, I have found 4 major errors in code examples, questions and the answers provided. There appear to be significant differences between the student book (This one) and the Teachers edition as well. While the basics of the language are covered you'll be second guessing the text with questions such as ""Is that even a valid piece of code""..."
1,Try others,"We use the textbook as a part of a introduction to C++. I can not recommend this book to those of us trying to get over the steep and very tough learning curve of Visual C++. There seems to be mistakes and typo's in every chapter. This does not help matters when you spend hours working with the assignments that are given at the end of each chapter. For the life of me I could never figure out why authors of programming books glance over some of the most important topics? In this text, ""Functions"" and ""Classes"" are not given enough details and the examples do not do justice. For it's [cost] this book is better suited for those with some experience with C++."
4,Cheap alternative to most,"Works really well for occasional use. I wouldn't use for commercial applications, as the switches might not hold up in constant use."
3,Great Study Batman!,"This is a great book, an extra tool for modern sounds. I would suggest this book to anyone looking to increase their vocabulary of technique. But...I thought there would be more exercises in there, especially for 35$ It was a little light on the information. It starts with right hand stuff, gaining independence from one finger to the next. But then he goes atonal, there's not really any formula to what he does other than play the string with nearest finger. I would've liked to get some more linear things, scales, how he fingers them, and common arpeggios, not in 5's, like straight dominant, or maj,7th's would've been nice, he then give lines to go over chords and then his studys. It actually reminds me of classical guitar, through memorization, rather than pure improvisation. Don't get me wrong I liked the book, I was just expecting a little more from this guy, I mean you have to hear him play, amazing!"
1,World's Most Boring Book,"I am amazed at the glowing reviews of this boring ond overly-long tome. Where is an editor when you need one? I have never quit a book--but came close with this one. I kept waiting for something to really happen. Nothing ever did. Perhaps I read it at the wrong time--i.e. during an economic crisis--for this tale of a wealthy, spoiled woman who treated her mother like garbage and never did a day's work in her pampered life just made me mad. I really disliked Edna."
3,"Great Quintet, not so good ending","The Cleric Quintet is by far, my favorite series ever made. Drizzt is a close second. All five books where beautiful, wonderful story telling, humour, and the fight scenes are incredible. The character growth is amazing, you see Cadderly grow up, change, forced to change. While The Chaos Curse was a great book, the actual ending, the last chapter, I think was aweful. I dont believe anyone wanted to see Cadderly become 90 years old and die just to build a church. It seemed a waste of character, and it made me feel betrayed..R.A. Salvatore is a great writer, but the whole ending of the story was a complete let down"
3,Only one reason to read this series,The Bouldershoulder Brothers. They are the funniest characters in the forgotten realms. Everything else in the series is blah.
4,A good conclusion to a series that took too long.,"While ""The Chaos Curse"" gave the closure that I was looking for, it, like most Forgotten Realms novels, had a predictable ending to a series that should have been a trilogy. While I enjoy the work of R.A. Salvatore, I think that he stretched this story out too much. Read the book to finish the series, not to be astounded by the author's literary prowess."
2,Concluding the Quintet.,"As a fan of Salvatores past work, I decided to bite onto this series. Unfortunately the series started on an odd foot, developed some interesting if not partally shallow characters and then proceeded to become more and more disapointing until, at last, the series ends with this.. um.. book. The book was better written then most of the pulp thats out there, but it left me with a bad taste in my proverbial mouth. I gave it extra credit for ending the story then and not dragging the series out for another book. Now I understand why Salvatore usually writes trilogies."
2,Should have been a quartet...,"Seriously, with this as the final volume, I think the Cleric Quintet would have been better as the Cleric Quartet. If you've read the rest of the series (which is excellent) you'll want to read this one just to know how it all wraps up. The series deserved a better ending though, one that wasn't so painful to read."
3,I have to concur with the disappointing ending,"I pretty much enjoyed this series, as with all books of this genre, the pure escapism is the aspect the draws the most. I was, however, very disappointed with the ending - it was as well written as the rest of the series, just not what you would have hoped for the characters... That said, I would heartily recommend any of Salvatores work as a fun read, especially addicts of the Forgotten Realms AD&D setting and assoicated games (Baldurs Gate et al)."
5,hair cloour,the color is very easy i purchased this from amazon . price is reasonable . the color is very nice for mens black hair . it takes 5 minutes to use it . it lasts for 6 weeks . i do not do it my self . my hair dresser puts it on . i will be using it in the future .
3,Good,Bought it as a gift for my dad he hasn't used it so I wouldn't know how it was but i'm pretty sure it is perfect
5,My Favorite Children's Book,"I am an elementary school counselor and read this book to second graders. They love the comparisons of skin colors to foods, and it leaves everyone feeling good about the way they look. It is a strong multicultural book, but the presentation is very subtle, and not preachy."
2,Very shallow,"I understand and appreciate the intent here. However, vaguely cheerful affirmations that ""yes, people come in different colors, like food!"" aren't likely to actually make any child more aware of diversity or accepting of it. Also, it's a little weird that in this ""let's all accept each other!"" book many of the other characters have jobs which are just a bit stereotypical of their origins.There are better choices for young children. If you want to speak just about diversity, I suggest you focus on having a broad library rather than the same old standbys (with mostly white characters) and a few Let's Be Friends books. It can be more difficult to get books with non-white protagonists, but it is not impossible. If you've been having trouble in your kid with actual bigotry, I suggest a book that discusses this head-on - a good picture book biography or a picture book historical fiction would be more useful."
1,Shallow,"Oh my. Wow, does this book miss the point of differences/ our uniqueness! This book identifies an object similar to the child's skin color (e.g., cinnamon, chocolate cupcakes, etc...) and demonstrates very little about how we are unique by our interests, culture, heritage, national origin, etc... Very shallow.We will not be reading this book to any of the members of our multiracial family. I would hope that others could grow to learn about the uniqueness of our family, other multiracial families and/or families of races other than their own in ways BEYOND skin color. This book misses the boat. One dimensional: skin color."
3,the colors of us,"it may show diversity but it also uses stereotypes. i'm not a fan of this illustration style because it just makes all of the characters look like offensives drawings of minorities in the early 1900s. as much as i want to give this book a great review, i can't because of this. it's just ok. 3 stars."
3,My 5 YO loves this book,"I live in a very monochromatic area and I wanted a book that focused on skin color and the differences out there. I am happy with the book and my son loves it. I have seen reviews that talk about the stereotypes portrayed, and they are there in the book, but really my 5 year old isn't looking at anything but the colors of the people, he doesn't see stereotypes. I think this book is a good addition to the library of anyone who wants a nice book that demonstrates that there are different colors of people out there. There are different shades of ""white"" and different shades of ""black""- or as this book points out- we are really all just different shades of brown. No, it doesn't go into detail about different cultures- but then the title isn't The Cultures of Us"" either."
3,Cute and simple,"This book is simple and doesn't try to explain race or adoption or any other reasons why people, and families, are all different shades and colors. It is very heavy on food analogies, so if you are averse to comparing people to food this book will really bug you. If that doesn't bother you, it's a cute story that helps kids realize we are so many different colors."
2,The Colors of Us,"If you are a child in school who after drawing picture of a person in black/brown and consequently receiving a backlash from other children, who tell you that the picture is ugly, and you are not supported by your teacher, you will appreciate a book that celebrates diversity in skin colour. If you are a child who consequently begins to wish you were white (a problem that is all too common amongst black children) you would appreciate a book that celebrates diversity in skin colour. When you look at a person, what you see first is their physical appearance, including their skin colour, and, unfortunately, if it is black/brown all to often it elicits a negative reaction. Therefore, there is a place for books about skin colour. Stereotypes are not helpful, however."
4,Cute but thin,This book is a simple and easy read. My nephew enjoyed it. I myself personally think there should have been more of a storyline to it.
1,Not a Good Product,Lasted 3.5 months..Rip off...A Good Price is Worthless if the Product is Crap... I would go back to the Manufacturer or Retail Store where you purchased it to get a REAL OEM product instead of a Chinese Counterfeit knockoff..Good luck!
1,JVC TS-CL110UAA RPTV Lamp Replacement,"JVC TS-CL110UAA RPTV Lamp Replacement was alot cheaper than previously ordered replacement lamps. I have ordered directly from JVC in the past and notice a big difference in this replacement lamp. Not the same quality. I noticed a big difference in the past after installing the lamp, the television was alot brighter. With this replacement lamp, it was the same as the old lamp but there is light reflecting on the wall behind the television that was not there in other lamps. Will have to wait and see how long this one lasts."
1,Get what you pay for,"This is the second lamp that I ordered, the first lamp wouldn't fit even though it looked exactly like the lamp I was replacing. The second replacement is terrible, uneven and low light thru out the screen and wild displays of color.The price was cheap and so was the quality. I do not recommend these low cost lamps.I am waiting for a replacement lamp that I paid 3 times as much for."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"I bought this replacement lamp in the middle of June this year (2012). It worked just fine for the first month or so. After that the image started getting darker. Now only 3 months later we can hardly see any images on the screen. We made extra sure this would work on our television and unfortunately it only worked (barely) for 3 months. Very disappointing! I guess the old saying is true - You Get What You Pay For. We put in a more expensive, better quality lamp and it's working great now."
1,not impressed,Item came in timely fashion but in less then 1yr picture went very dark. Was hard to watch tv. Then while waiting for another bulb from another co. the bulb exploded.
1,Worked for 8 days then failed,"This lamp worked for 8 days then would not restart. The tube is not sealed in glass like the OEM and could damage your tv if it breaks.In my case it fails to restart but the tube did not break, it would glow orange and error the TV. Amazon gave me a full refund. I bought another lamp from DM that is the same as the OEM for $100.00. It has a one year warranty and it works fine. Amazon should work a deal with DM, they have better lamps."
1,don't buy knock off bulbs,"I was very dissatisfied with the quality of these bulbs.It only lasted about 100 days with average use and when i contacted margin mart they acted like they cared less.They kept pushing me to contact amazon to take care of this problem which they did by giving me full credit, kudos to a great customer service at amazon but as far as margin mart stay far away."
1,blew up,"looked at several of these on amazon... wasn't sure about which one to get. was it made in china, did it actually work.... well i installed it 6 weeks ago and the picture quality on my 52"" jvc tv is excellent. the install instructions were not there, had to find them online, but that only took a minute or so. installation only took 5 minutes. so far so good. UPDATE 11-4-11, well the bulb blew out after about 4 months. Not good, since the first one lasted 6 years.Gonna find another brand this time."
3,8 months later,"This lamp worked out great at first. Starting in month 6, my picture went significantly dimmer. Every once in a while, the picture brightens back up, but you can see it suddenly go dimmer again while watching.Not positive that it was the lamp, but thought I would add this review."
1,wrong one!,"Sent wrong one then couldn't even replace had to ship back, reorder from another co. who also gave wrong one!"
3,JCV DLP replacement lamp,"We haven't had a chance to use it yet, so cannot really give it a rating, but those emails asking me to rate keep coming."
1,Lamp Fail!,I ordered this lamp to replace the 5 year old lamp that came with the TV. Ordered in June of 2012 and it failed in October of 2012. Lasted a whole 5 months.
2,lamp quality in question,I purchased a replacement lamp for my JVC DLP. The lamp quality is not very good and the resulting picture quality is disappointing. I tried the lamp of another DLP of the same model and the results were the same. Have to be careful who the manufaturer is.
5,Replaced Lamp for JVC TSCL110UAA,I purchased this lamp about 30 daysago it works great my JVC playslike its a new TV!
2,Not satisfactory,Picture dim and very unclear. Not up to a brand new bulb. Are you sure these came from JVC or are they seconds or refurbished? Something is wrong with them. I am going to have to go direct to a service center to check the lamp. I am not happy with the results.
2,bad bulb sending back for refund,"I have previously used a replacement bulb in my TV last year. I got a whole year out of the bulb so I thought that was a decent return for a cheaper replacement. I have a 65"" JVC tv and the replacement cost for a new 65"" HD tv really outweighs the risks of a new bulb.This bulb is super dim, can hardly see the screen. Also there are spots and horizontal lines which look like cheap silvering process on the reflector. I would send the bulb back for a replacement but there was no option for that from the seller, instead I will ship back.Other reviews say to not waste your time with these bulbs, but I did get a whole year out of a previous one. You will just have to go through some defective ones first. At this point getting the new JVC bulb is tough due to the set being older. I really don't want to invest in a new TV so I am not sure what to do now. Again I wish the seller just had an exchange option, not just a pure send back for refund."
1,Rip Off,This JVC Lamp replacement is a piece of thrash. It blew out inside of my TV in less than 4 months and I had to vacuum out the pieces. I do not know if my TV will work after this explosion. The seller refuses to acknowledge that since he sold a defective lamp he should replace it. He tells me it had a 90 day warranty. I did not see that on the site before I purchased it. I have been on other sites selling these replacement lamps and they come with a 1 year warranty. They are supposed to last 2000 to 3000 hours so why would they only give a 90 day warranty? They know this is junk made in China and they are not willing to make good . I am not the only customer that has had this problem with them. I would give them 0 stars
4,JVC TS-CL110UAA DLP review,"This is a rear projection bulb replacement for may JVC tv's. A bulb is a lot cheaper to replace than a whole tv. Took one minute to remove. Took about 30 seconds to install. There is a cool video on you tube showing how it's done. Watched it and now i'm the expert. Be advided, please unplug you tv from the outlet before you attempt to replace the bulb! My wife is the tv watcher so I asked her could she tell the difference? She said not really."
4,Lamp worked,I had been paying +$200 for replacement lamps. I am definitely happy with this product. The packaging was excellent and it arrived on time. Have had it installed for over a month and it is working fine.
2,NOT WORTH IT,"I do not recommend purchasing this bulb. It lasted 9 months. I am not a person that watches television daily so it definitely should have lasted much longer. I was hoping to get at least 2 years or more out of it. I rely greatly on reviews before making most purchases, so I felt this review was necessary."
3,"Not OEM product, cheaper aftermarket bulb","This lamp replacement was not an OEM JVC product as advertised. It was a much cheaper aftermarket product and weighed substantially less than the original product. However, it did fit correctly and appears to be working fine in my TV. The original JVC bulb lasted over 5 years, so I guess time will tell on the quality of this replacement bulb. But for the price it's a good deal, just don't think they should mislead the buyer that it's an OEM product from JVC, because it's not."
5,Great Value,"I was a little reluctant at first when I saw the price at $40.00 when the lamp is usually nearly $200.00, but I tried it anyways because of the guarantee. I'm glad that I did, I've been using it for a month now and I don't notice any difference between this aftermarket lamp and the two O.E.M. lamps over the years, that I bought from JVC at a 179.00 a piece.. I will soon be buying an additional one for a back-up"
4,No problems... looks good!,"After 30 days, still looks as good as the original bulb. If it dies an early death or ends up disappointing me, I will update this."
2,failed after 2 months,Picture started to darken a few days ago. Now it is unaccepatable. will order the same one again as sometimes bulbs will fail prematurely.
3,Great while it lasted,"This lamp was great while it lasted. Ordered it in July 2011, and it blew up today Jan. 29, 2012. Lamp was easy to install, was clear and bright in my 56"" JVC TV but did not last that long. One thing that is a little worrying is when the lamp went, it literally shatered the lamp glass into the tv housing. Had to use shop vac and tweezers to get the glass out from the inside of the lamp housing area. I have ordered another, will have to wait and see if the last one damaged the mirrors (which would suck as it would probably mean the TV is toast). Bottom line is should last longer, and not blow up and leave the lamp glass everywhere. Yes I did where gloves when I installed it too. Good thing they are getting cheaper theses days. May buy another one in a month or so as to have a back up on hand. Just glad it wasn't Super Bowl sunday I guess.Shatered in CA"
5,Quality and a snap to install,"If you have a TV that uses this model of bulb, you can replace this device literally with a Phillips screwdriver and 10 minutes or less. The most difficult part of the task is locating where the access panel on the TV is and openiing the well-construtive protective shipping packing that the bulb arrives in. Good job all around. I suggest purchasing at least 2 at a time so that, when you need to replace it, you don't even have to miss the program you are viewing. While I have had several bulbs burn out on me (I have had the TV for a number of years and it is on much of the time)... I have learned to always have a spare on hand. The TV performs well, with its Achielles-heel being the bulb. For the price, I find this a viable solution to retaining the quality TV experience at a reasonable and convenient maintainance cost (less than a penny a day)."
4,Great price,Much less expensive than the last time I replaced the bulb. The outer case didn't have the metal handle like the original. There was no recycling of the old one back to the company. I will have to find a place to take it. Contains mercury in these bulbs. Fast shipping and reasonable price.
5,It works!,"Just replaced the original lamp with this one manufactured by Philips ten minutes ago... Our JVC 52 inch DLP television seems good as new! As tempting as it was to replace the television (since the price of HD televisions has come down so far since we first purchased this t.v.), the gap between the price of the lamp and a new television made the replacing the bulb idea seem more sensible. I was skeptical of replacing the bulb (throwing good money after bad), but it seems to have worked."
1,Tried with no luck!,"I am one who is fine testing out a no name brand in hopes of finding success with it. Unfortunately this is not the product worth going no name brand with. Instead of the pricier (by three times) JVC bulb that was obviously recommended in the owners manual of our tv, I decided to give this one a try for the fraction of the price. When my husband first installed it, one of the screws really didn't fit properly but he was able to get it to finally go in. Once in we thought everything appeared to be fine until three weeks later when the bulb completely went out and we found ourselves staring at a black screen and blinking power/bulb failure lights. Luckily we are in the process of returning it (just as we received the email asking for our review from amazon). Since we are within our 30 days I'm hoping there will be no problem even though we had thrown away our original packaging. In the end you do pay for what you get..."
1,Not a JVC Original as stated.,"The description for this item states that is a JVC Original in the housing. JVC Is not made in China, so this is definately not a JVC Original. Plus I have bought several originals and they come in a JVC box. This is not an original and therfore not worth this much money. I would not have purchased this if I had known that it was not JVC."
1,Bad Bulbs,Bought 2 bulbs and both had dark areas (i.e. light on part of screen and dark on other parts).two orderedtwo bad.
4,"A Good, Essential Selection of Pam Grier","A good selection of Pam Grier in blaxploitation era, the set covers the three essential movies. In short, watch these three volumes, then you know Pam in the 70s. For those who are eager to know more, these movies are described as follows: Friday Foster is ""bright and cute Pam""; Foxy Brown ""sexy and tough Pam""; and Coffy is no doubt the best of Pam Grier!"
1,Does not fit A867,"This charger does not fit the Samusung Eternity SGH-A867. It might possibly fit the Eternity II but this is a small head on the charger not the larger head that the A867 requires. Even though it clearly states that this is for an A867, in order to obtain a refund the company requires that I pay for shipping back to them. Ludicrous. They should pay for their own mistakes."
5,a tip of the coconut to Mr. Corbin,"It takes spades of talent to create music as beautiful as this without the aid of layered mixing, over-hyped production and in Miles' case, even lyrics. Even if you're not a big surf fan, but are looking for a rage-dump disc, this is it! If you happen to love surf to begin with, you will be pleasently surprised. Although, I do want to mention that this is not a full-blooded surf album. It is mainly sparkling reverb with occasional acoustic amid a tapestry of soft bongo-like percussion. No one plays as clean or precisely as Miles. His songwriting capabilities are the real treat here though. Haunting, dramatic but always relaxing, it dosen't get more mellow or exotic than this."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,Very Poor quality of recording. They are the original artists - but not original recordings.
2,They Are Not Really Chocks,"I just bought two #28005 Deluxe Tire Chocks and discovered the warning to remove the chocks before hooking and unhooking my trailer. Had I known that I would never have purchased the product. They should explain that in your ads. It is not really a chock at all, but a stablizing system. I am not happy. If I have to carry real chocks to hoop and unhook, there are products that will do both."
3,Gabriel Byrne Fan,"Well I am a Gabriel Byrne fan and purchased this video for that reason. There are two versions in existence, I am still trying to get the uncut version which I believe will give the story more substance. The cut version just leaves too much out to bring to life the fear and jealousy involved in this plot.....I believe most of the talents of all the actors in this movie were not explored, much better movies out there with GB in.....:)"
1,Dumb/NC-17?,"This film was just plain dumb. I see very few have bothered to even write a review. That says a lot. There is little plot, no character development, and the NC-17 rating isn't appropriate. Maybe because this movie is kind of old...The sex scenes are mild. Anyway, Gabriel Byrne has very few lines and just avoid this..."
5,An excellent resource to guide you through pregnancy!!!,"PREGNANCY MYTHS, by Author Michael D. Benson, M.D. provides an easy to read, informative guide to understanding many of the significant issues confronting pregnant women today. I would highly recommend this book to all pregnant women as well as women considering pregnancy. In addition, this book is a wonderful tool for the practicing obstetrician to help us understand many of our patients thoughts, ideas, and concerns during this emotional and exciting time in their lives."
5,Very good book,Most books on the subject are too theoretical to be of any use (a surplus of PhD's in the subject perhaps). This book is rigorous in its treatment of the subject but easy to follow.
2,"Be careful, you want 1997 EMI not 2000 Disky","Disky release has a longer version of Paloma Blanca that is NOT the hit version from 1975. The original hit version is only on the EMI release from 1997, and you'll pay $60 or more for that CD!"
4,No home should be without it,"This book has turned out to be real handy whenever little mishaps (like suddenly noticing too much dust on a mini-blind) occur. But, having attended college with her, I think Heloise Jr. could've done a bit better. I know she changed the course of MY life after I had one of her special brownies about 20 minutes before a piano solo I had to perform before an audience of professors as part of a final exam. Suffice it say, I'm a lousy but happy housewife now."
4,Good resource to Plan Windows 2K Rollout,"If you need to upgrade from NT 4.0 domain to Windows 2K, this is the book you are looking for.Right from evaluation to implementation was covered. The langauge used is plain and simple. No unnecessary jargon usage. Wherever the jargons are used (like KERBOROS Security), it was clearly explained. If you have any problem with Active Directory services of Win 2K, pls read this book before asking anybody. This will additionally help you to understand, what kind of compatibility it has with LDAP.Security, is the key to this OS, and you will learn how. All the Executive Services are explained in details, including the plug and play support and HAL. The internetworking with Novell NetWare is also described. A whole part of the book is devoted to the Enterprise networking, which will help even the novice to suggest ways and means to have WAN in place."
5,High Quality HDMI 1.3a Cable,"Don't waste your money on anything more expensive (like $150 monster) they perform exactly the same. This cable is HDMI 1.3a which is important to note, cables that are not will become dated more quickly. With 10.2Gbps this standard is built to last. They should advertise better that this is 1.3a, currently the latest. The highest quality, latest standard, at a extremely low price, what else can you ask for?"
5,Superb Cable,i bought this cable to use with my new Panasonic pz700 u plasma hdtv and volla what it did is still beyond me i have hd dvr box from cable company with reguler cable connection i was getting 480i signal for all non hd channels and 1080i (HD SIGNAL)FOR FEW ABOUT 13 CHANNELS but when i connect this cable HDMI TO HDMI (DVR AND TV)MAN I WAS SHOCKED that all non hd channels were running on 1080i res after that and hd chan were catching 1080p instead of 1080i my entire tv became HD but than again this cable will only work that way if u have dvr boc with HDMI PORT and tv with the same port offcourse plus the tv has to be 1680x1024 full HD CAPEABLE it is a great cable i tell you that I RED SOME WHERE THAT NOW NEW PLASMA LCD TV SETS HAVE PRO SCAN FUNCTION THAT WAY WITH PROPER HDMI CONNECTION THE TV CAN CHANGE THE RES TO 480i to 1080i BECAUSE I AM THE LIVING PROOF MINE IS RUNNING AT 1080i OR 1080p
1,Late Response,"I have not yet received the item, so I am not reviewing the item as much as I am providing a review on the vendor. Product was ordered over a week ago and has still not been shipped. How long should it take to ship out an HDMI cable? Order from elsewhere is my recommendation."
5,"Great book for any kid's library, even 50-year-old kids!","I'm a cellist, and I really love this book...and I'm 50 years old! If you (or your kids) liked ""The Philharmonic Gets Dressed,"" you'll enjoy this one, too.The text (written by a musician) is informative, and the delightful illustrations are amazing in detail and accuracy. I love that they even have barogue bows and bow holds on viol players!"
5,Superb Product,"It's fast, very easy to use, and has the quality you would expect from a mac software product. The best I've ever used."
1,Popcorn contunes to have problems with Tiger,"I purchased this product a few months back with much anticipation- I believed that I had gotten myself a quality product that the Mac community held in high esteem. Sadly, this was not the case. My G4 Powerbook's superdrive remains unused. Not once has this product not shown an error when trying to compress or burn a DVD. I have downloaded the patch (1.0.3, released in May '05) and still no DVD burning, it seems that OS-X Tiger and Popcorn don't get along. Check their help forum (http://forums.support.roxio.com/index.php)- I don't seem to be alone with this problem... I really want Roxio to fix this, but until that happens I cannot advise anyone on throwing away their $50 for this product."
2,A half-assed solution to backing up DVDs.,"This program cannot work with commercial DVDs directly. That means that in order to copy them, you would have to use a second program to decrypt and copy the DVD to your hard drive, after which Popcorn can deal with it. While it works, it's a little clumsy.It would have been easy for Roxio to get this program to work with commercial DVDs. They chose not to.Sadly, there are no very good options on the Mac; ""DVD Backup"" does the job, but has been buggy, is shockingly overpriced, and surgically grafts itself to your computer (if you have more than one computer, you can only run it on one of them, and must go through a song and dance to switch it between machines.)"
5,Great product!,Roxio products have worked extremely well for me and this is no exception. Has copied DVDs flawlessly thus far. I don't even notice a drop in quality due to its compression. Just a great product.
4,Great Application for Compressing and Burning DVD's,"Popcorn does an excellent job of copying and compressing non-copyrighted DVD's to a DVD-R/RW. For burning, it uses the Roxio Toast technology. There is one fault I can find, and that is I get frequent audio skips when the DVDs are played back on an older DVD Player (this occurs on my 6-year old Pioneer Player, but plays just fine on my newer Sony player). Also, while it can burn Quicktime files to a DVD, it cannot compress Quicktime files. And this is one feature that I am looking for in a compression application. So the gigabytes on the Quicktime file have to be less than what can be burned to a DVD-R/RW or less than 4.7gb."
2,You should buy the regular.,"This brand does make a superior coconut milk, but Amazon buyers are always on the lookout for a good deal. The only difference between this Lite Coconut Milk andThai Kitchen Pure Coconut Milk, 13.66-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)is water! That being said, stretch your dollar and buy the regular version. To cut calories and fat, add the water yourself."
4,image,"why is everyone coming down so hard on this book? it was the first indiana book i read and lead me on to read his other books, and then on again to dennis cooper. ""rent boy"" is not entirely about plot, or reality, or relivance to the real world. it's a ficticious glimpse, a set of scenes from a world that either could be or is. it doesn't make a difference if this world ""is"" or ""is not"" because what's brilliant is the observation and the writing, the concept."
3,"he writes well, but the plot doesn't make it","indiana is a good writer and the scene etc. is credible. The organ harvesting scheme in the later part of the book seems to contradict the ""reality"" of the first part. I'm sure all the people the character waits on, in his job as a waiter, are real or composites. I only ""got"" two, but if I was more involved in the scene, I'm sure I could make out the others. It's a very self-referential book, so maybe the organ stealing stuff is some elaborate parody of someone. I think Indiana does better with the less elaborate descriptions and parodies."
1,Not the real thing,"This Gary Indiana writing in the voice of a hustler is a hoot! He imagines it all, gets it wrong--probably heard it all wrong. Anybody who knows what it's really like will get a few laughs, unintended by Indiana (though he thinks he's very funny in his way-off views). No way, dude!"
1,What a dud!,"I picked up this book because of the title, and, man, did I go wrong! If this is the story of a hustler, then I don't know the scene--and I do; this is a book for anyone who doesn't know anything about the scene and wants to read what someone like this guy imagined it to be. I laughed aloud, but not where the writer intended."
2,"Excellent music, bad vinyl pressing","This vinyl, released on Back on Black, is a great addition to anyones collection, but only music wise. I have had three copies of this vinyl (all on Back on Black), two of them were slightly warped (ordered from amazon) and the third one had some discoloring (the machine making them wasnt probably clean enough and there is some light white colouring on the surface of the vinyl which cannot be washed off). I`m definitely not happy with the quality control of Back on Black on this pressing. Even the quality of the former soviet union record label ""Melodija"" had better quality control."
2,Dissapointed.,"Hm.. so yeah. All the reviews said that this album is a spectacular masterpeice of black metal, oh ho, I beg to differ. Every review made me more psyched to buy and listen to this album. So before goin' on ahead and doin' so I downloaded a previous album of theirs to check it out. It was ""Below the Lights"" which I think is a MUCH better album then this. It has more melody and a much more pizazz. I really enjoyed Below the Lights and expected Ruun to be more like that.Ruun is so boring, melow, and monotone it makes you want to (and I know it's way too easy but I'ma go ahead and type it anyways) ruun as far away from the horrid sound as fast as possible! OK, so it's not that bad, but still it's pretty bad. But hey, it may just be not my cup of tea.The vocals are pretty good, which is why I gave it a 2 and not a 1, but still they're not great either.Anyways, I found this album to be pretty dull and uncaptivating. It's just the same recylced, strung out beats over and over again."
2,What happened........,"I recieved the package in the mail, only to find that if you have windows 2000, LSL is not going to run on your computer. Half of the games on the disk are unplayable, and one of the disks wouldn't even install on my computer. NOT A GOOD BUY!!!!"
2,What a disappointment!,The set of four vehicles arrived in a 4 by 8 inch box. Nowhere in the description was it stated that they are so small. If it had been I would not have ordered the set. The only thing you had to do was use glue!!
3,Not So Much Fun,Not much to build... add some wheels & thats it. We were done assembling in about 10 minutes w/ all 4.YOu could get some scrap wood & some wheels from the hobby shop & have the same thing
4,Grandkids love these for rany days (we have lots of those in WA State!),"I gave it a 4 because they are fairly small, and it wasn't obvious (to me) from the ad. However they are pretty good quality, and the kids have a good time sanding and painting each time we get a new one out.Pete A"
4,CHRISTmas gift,I ordered for a 7 year old and when I got it I realized it was too young for him. So I gave it as a secret Santa gift.
5,great craft ideas,I just got this book and can't wait to get started on some of the ideas they have in here.
1,Plastic handles break easily,I have tendinitis so my grip is not very strong but the plastic handles cracked after only a couple months of use. My Mr. Dudley (wooden) pepper mill still works great after years of use.
2,"Well, it does grind pepper.",I bought the pepper grinder because of the one handed operation and the way it looked. It does grind pepper with one hand as advertised. My main complaints about this grinder are that it:A. Does not grind enough pepper per squeeze andB. Chunks of pepper are left even when on the finest settingYou could do much better than this grinder. The one handed operation is not worth putting up with large chunks of pepper all over your food. The pepper mill in your spice aisle at the grocery store does a better job.
2,average at best,"Along with the small amount of pepper per squeeze, this plastic ball has a seam along the middle that will be stressed everytime you use it and will ultimately begin to split, unrepairable. This is not a durable pepper mill. I'm replacing mine with another model."
2,Breaks... don't buy it,Thought I'd save a few bucks and buy this little grinder for $8. I should've bought the more expensive and better quality one since now I have to go buy another. Both handles have broken off and now I have to throw it out.
5,a brand you can depend on..Columbia,"I love my sandals and knew I would be pleased with them as I have always found the Columbia products to be the best. Quality, comfort and value you can count on. These are no different and are in the nicest shade of blue. Took them on a major walking trip and have no complaints. That was a true test."
2,not as comfortable as I hoped,"The color is very nice, but the sandals are rather stiff - walking is not very comfortable. I rarely use them. Going downhill is especially uncomfortable. Will not buy another pair."
5,A Wonderful Comprehensive Resource,"John T. Boal's, Be a Global Force of One, is a wonderful guide to programs that enhance our community. The programs in Boal's book are a fun and effective way to get the community involved in our society."
3,Numerous well-thought out ideas to improve local communities,"Although this book had many ideas to improve (your) local community and schools through individuals and businesses, it was at times ""dull."" It wasn't always a ""good read."" However, there were some good ideas for reference purposes."
3,Succinct and Priced Right,"Attempting to read the Elder Eddas without some familiarity with Norse mythology can be confusing. I got this book because it is short and inexpensive, thus providing me with the needed background without a large investment in time or money.The book was written in Danish and translated into English a century ago. Its strong point is the succinct summaries of the Norse myths.On the other hand, there is at least one curious omission. The book refers to the death of Baldur, but makes no reference to the story of how Baldur died, in a William Tell type archery contest.Another strange feature is that its summary of Beowulf, which the author considered to be a Norse myth, is incorrect. Contrary to this book's claim, Beowulf did NOT cut off Grendl's arm with a sword. On the contrary, Beowulf said that he would not use a sword because Grendl did not, and pulled Grendl's arm out of its socket.It turned out that Grendl was enchanted and so impervious to swords."
2,Not that useful without an index!,"This map is 19"" x 35"". It has a cardboard fold over cover to protect it when not in use and glossy paper.Unbelievably, there is no town index!! Their description above should have stated that.Disappointing."
2,"self-absorbed, self-pitying, self-justifying, turgid Cinderella","Unlike Cinderella, Arshawsky was determined to be rich and famous, from very early in his life. After he succeeded he got real pissy about it. Many other celebrities have managed to deal with it, but Artie seems to love throwing hissy-fits. And in his version of things, he's always pure of motive and clean of mind. Others have different versions. I love his music, but it's hard to hear it any longer as having the same purity and beauty that it did before I read this book. If you want to enjoy sausage, don't investigate too closely how it's made."
4,Great album,"This is a great album! It is varied in and stylish, Blackstone's lyrics are thoughtful. I have had the album now ever since it was first released and come back to it every couple of weeks and never grow tired of it."
4,star wars rocks,The boys play this stinking game ALL DAY LONG!!!! You got to love George Lucas. Now off to go see Red Tails! Or maybe episode 1 in 3d.
3,Classic Game,"Loved this game and played it a lot as a child, though after a while the soundtracks never played without the ""broken record"" effect and sometimes didn't play at all. Don't buy this game for PS2 if you're looking for good graphics. It's fun, but gets boring after a while because overall it's too easy."
2,Way to confusing,"If you are going to get Battlefront, GET #1. #2 is so much more confusing, Jedi are a complete rip off and worst of all you have to earn your characters. #1 is all around 50X better. Please go to [..] for reviews for this game and other games too!"
5,better than first!,star wars in space!star wars on the ground!star wars EVREYTHANG! STAR WARS!@%^%$&y%^&$^*(&%@%^%#!$@#!@
2,This game is OK for the ps2 but i suggest getting it for pc,I bought the first game and that one for PS2 was great. Very intuitive and brining some fun things the FPS games. The second eeeeehhhhh not so much. The game can get really REAllY choppy at times and can lag pretty bad. And the space battles are raelly hard. It's not like in the first one where you could fly around for three hours. You have to get your business done and fast or risk being blown out of the sky. (which isn't bad but it can get frustration if you just start playing it) Overall i ahve to say the PC version was much better. Everything was smooth and there was none of the bugs that plagued the last version. Online play is MUCH easier to do.In over if possible get this for the PC but if not its still a decent game to pick up.
2,"Sorry, not as good as the first","Absolutely loved BF1, so I went out and bought this on the first day for PS2. I think they tried too hard, the graphics are too overwhelming therefore jittery and not anywhere close to seamless. The missions seem too complicated and you really have no control on the outcome. Initially I'm thinking this was a waste of $50. It's not nearly as fun to play as BF1."
5,Nice.........................,"""waz up"": I know this review is bad but.................... this game this is so cool! ""peace me homee!"""
1,Totally ripped off,"You only got a star because it was a mandatory field.Not only was the horrendous postage not clearly disclosed at point of sale, but the game when arrived was not compatible with Australian playstation consoles...something to do with PAL.We have all learned the enormous advantages of shopping locally.Thanks for the lesson."
4,Star Wars Battlefront 2,"Awsome game especially if you liked the first one, good game for people who dont even like star wars because its really fun and the battles are just as or more exciting as many of the top shooting title"
5,Inferior to the original,This has cool 3D wire frame 'hologram' menus from the first game are no more and have been replaced by lame DVD-esquire background footage from the movies.More important the Galactic Conquest mode is over complicated and the Galaxy map makes it hard to work out what's going on. You can't just pick any enemy planet to attack as before; now you have to move there in turns like is some lame board game.
