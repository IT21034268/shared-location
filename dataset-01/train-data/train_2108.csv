1,... Or 1001 ways to fill out a 6 page pamphlet,"I should have know that a book with '1001' in the title would be a total brain fart, but still I bought it. To my surprise I was proved wrong, it was worse. With `neat' ideas like ""Send a press kit to a national producer via overnight mail. Even if they don't know you , they will open an Express Mail envelope since it conveys a sense of urgency""and this gem:""Deliberately make some mistakes, either in your promotional material or around your place of business (?) and challenge your customers to find them (!)""You are kidding right? Wrong. Has Lisa Shaw ever opened her eyes. I pray she never does.A total waste of tree."
3,This book provides a good starting point for new marketers.,"As noted above, there are many good ideas that can provide the foundation for a specific marketing plan. The book covers many areas of marketing for small businesses, with some overlap into big business proceedures."
4,Good book if you just want to browse through ideas,"As the title says this book is for Small Business owners. You would find more information on most marketing books but hey, this is a list with 1001 ideas each with a small description. Sometimes it really helps to see lots of ideas easily. And even one applied and successfull idea which you would otherwise miss is surely worth more than the price of this book."
2,"Nina hanan is right, these are bad concertos","I won't even discuss the violin concerto, since it is a universal favorite. The piano concertos, on the other hand, are childish works that border on the insipid. Even Mendelssohn's most eminent biographer, Phillip Radcliffe, found his works for piano and orchestra to be the least inspired of his oeuvre. These concertos each attempt some kind of con fuoco/appasionato profundity, but, like much of Mendelssohn, they to lack any depth. Of course these concertos suffer when placed next the greats (e.g., Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, etc) but I owuld even rank them below those by unknown composers such as Reinecke, Moscheles, and Field. Of course, all the performances are excellent."
3,duplicate,Not sure if I did not read well but I received an exact duplicate of this wisk in the box with my blender so I now have two.
2,The whisk is an included accessory with the 9-speed Professional Hand Mixer,You don't need to buy this item if you purchase the the KitchenAid 9-speed Professional Hand Mixer -- it's an included accessory.
3,Okay Addition,"I wanted this accessory for larger whipping jobs. It works fine, but is a bit flimsy compared to a regular hand whisk. Also manufacturer's price for an accessory is much too high."
2,NOT SO TOUGH,"Bought two pair of Steiner Pred pros for xmas gifts for my sons. One pair broke at the hinge.Was sent in for repair and did not hear anything for the longest time.After several........ calls and delays and half truths we missed a hunting season use and still got a run around.We heard such things as Steiner was bought out etc.One day a replacement pair shows up.They looked old not even in the box we sent and do not match the second pair. Lately I called Amazon and again means nothing.The same run around.We got your money,then it is like WHO ARE YOU ?"
4,Great set for watching animals.,"Great little set of binoculars that have clear and crisp optics. Steiner uses a coating to increase the contrast in the reds and browns found in animals fur. I was able to see Bald Eagles sitting in trees very clearly. My only wish is that they made ones with a reticle in a cheaper model. Rubber armor is great, focus is easy and the optical quality is perfect. They include a nice carry case and a neoprene cover for the eye cups. I recommend them to anyone who enjoys watching animals or hunting. Work well for general use as well. 10x26 power in a very small package. I bought these due to the Steiner Safari working so well in the past."
3,steiner 10x26,These are nice binos IF you can handle the very short eye relief of 10mm. I purchased these binos and they were not usable with that extremely short eye relief. Other than that one major flaw I was quite impressed with them. I was pleased to see that the the 'predator' optical coating doesn't change the apparent color of a scene.
4,Great for hiking,"Very light / good grip / clear view. I am pretty happy with the Predator Pro. I think the rain cover that is included could be better. it's just a piece of cloth that covers the eye cups, I thought caps would be better. Over all a good buy if your looking for a good travel binocular!-BONES-"
5,In those jeans is amazing,"Ginuwine is amazing, everything he brings out is good. Dont knock on him, he is an amazing singer and dancer.the person who gave this a 2 is on glue."
2,average at best,Ginuwine is basically a Singles Artist at best&He understands the concept of dropping a Club type of cut to lead off a Project.His Formula is well intact by now of course.He isn't much of a vocalist overall but He understands a cleaver title.both songs here are aight&work well in the clubs but don't expand to much but that works well for Ginuwines's range as a Vocalist&Artist.
1,DON'T SPEND MONEY ON THIS,"I don't know why they put this poor quality stuff on the market, the quality is so poor it is hard to listen to. It is hard to hear the instruments or vocals what a rip off!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"If you are expecting some guidance on the art of standup comedy, this video is not for you. Instead of attempting to teach some basics of comedy, it wastes its (and your) time with a cute little movie about a new commedienne and her first stage performance. They could have used this format to compare her performance with more polished ones and teach something but they don't and the other comics they show are neither better nor different than she is. (...)"
3,Okay Chokecherry,"This syrup isn't as good has home made, but will do if you can't have that. I think it probably has too much citric acid in it."
2,Warning,"This book should come with a warning. The tone is that of a zealot in the pulpit. There is no indication that the subject was about 75% B.S, (see part seven,'Our Virtues',of Beyond Good and Evil, and wince at the misogynistic rant)"
5,One of the best on my bookshelf!,"In my chaplaincy work I draw from a wide variety of prayer resources. I ran across this little book recently, and it has actually spent very little time ON my bookshelf...it's spent most of the time in my coat pocket, being used daily in my work and personal prayer life. The prayers are simple but very substantial and *very* much to the point. This one is a ""must"" for anyone who prays, I think."
2,.,"I'm disappointed with this product. The arms that grab on to the pitman arm are made of low grade metal, just like the bolts and wing nuts. The picture shows all high grade metal except for the bolts and wing nuts. The only reason I kept this item was because I needed it ASAP otherwise I would have returned it."
2,Don't do it,"I wish I'd have seen the last guy's review, I wouldn't have bought this. It's just a bunch of sound effects and computer noises. No music, not easy to listen to, in fact it's really kind of irritating. Maybe his other stuff is better, but don't get this one. The extra star is just in case he was in a slump during this album. Everyone else seems to like it."
5,Super deal,The ship looks like I have a piece of ocean inside my home. I get a lot of compliments on the look. Seller was incredibly quick to ship and his price was untouchable.
3,Too White-Biased,"I have always had a problem with White-Biased or Black-Biased books. They show you a bunch of games where it may be played correctly for 20 moves, and then Black screws up. How is White to learn why other moves by white would be a mistake, or what to do if Black actually played the correct move. Instead, it skews the soundness of the line. If the KIA should score 55% for White, there shouldn't be 90+% wins for White. Otherwise, a good book."
3,"e5 and f5 for black, the end of an era for me and the KIA","is a good book, but like a previous reviewer points out, what if black don't make any mistakes and avoids passive defence? there are good games in here (one by dolmatov that just blew me away) but this is an optomistic book at best, statistics for white with this opening are not good. Me, i leave it to 1 min games on the internet, play d4 and c4 as white these days, but praps to players 1600 KIA is a good tool until they advance"
5,"Bryan Smith & His Happy Piano - Music, Music, Music","I searched for an upbeat piano cd for a ""65+"" exercise class. I heard a selection from ""Bryan Smith & His Happy Piano"" on a local radio station which targets the ""mature"" audiance. I downloaded the ONE cd offered by Amazon.com and the ladies love it. It is upbeat and happy. I recommend this selection for anyone who loves piano music. I wish I could find more~!"
5,Something to treasure and listen to again and again!,I've seen the movie 'Amadeus' three times and loved every moment of it-especially the music!! (I played it once just to hear it) I would show it to anyone who enjoys a little humor and good music.
1,Terrible,"Terrible. Were these selections recorded on a gramophone, or what? There are a million recordings of each of these pieces that are so much better than the way they're presented here. There's no real sense of musicality at all; each piece sounds about as exciting as staring at the printed music would be. I'd be ashamed to use this CD to indoctrinate my friends to Mozart. If you want Mozart in all his lush greatness, go buy a CD by the ASMF, or the VPO, or reputable orchestras. But for Pete's sake, skip this one at all costs."
1,This CD isn't too great.,"I've heard the official soundtrack from the movie ""Amadeus"" and it's a million times better than this one. Symphony #25 and the Requiem excerpts are some of the worst recordings that I have heard. They aren't performed very musically in my opinion. None of these recordings compare to the quality recordings on the ""Amadeus"" soundtrack and I would not recommend this recording."
5,Wonderful music anyone can listen to at any time!,"I first began listening to Mozart when I recieved AMADEUS as a Christmas gift at the age of eight. Here I am, nine years later, enjoying the soundtrack of a tape I watched so many times it wore out. This CD is a wonderful investment. It acts out every possible emotion one can have. It's great to listen to at any time of the day, and wonderful to fall asleep to. I guarantee anyone who buys this CD will love it, including those hard-rock/heavy-metal fans (myself included)."
1,A waste of your money,Amaturish not worth your time and money.Long boring and nothing you can't get from any fitness book costing much less.
1,Poor Quality Item with Even Worse Customer Service,"Item arrived with pieces chipped and broken. I tried contacting Vision Decor by live chat, E-mail as well as by phone asking for them to replace the 2 damaged pieces, but no one responded. That was almost a week ago. Shame on you!"
4,40 WATER BABY,"Ok first thing is first, the renactments are terrible, but aside from that the real footage is great. Seeing 40 and the late great 2pac together was great. just seeing pac immortalized on film forever is great. Then of course you have the ever talanted Kurupt all over this dvd, he appears numerous times. Plus all the other guest from the real footage make this an interesting purchase, I recommend this to all."
2,"Really DUMB movie,but cool sex scene","I'm agreeing with the majority of reviews posted on this movie.It is a pretty terrible flick by any standards.Acting,plot;everything is bad.It's also fairly racist to both black and white people.It is one of those movies that is actually painful to watch.The only reason that I bought it to begin with is because I like Debra Wilson and I wanted to see her sex scene.That was pretty hot in my opinion.It's the only reason why I still have the movie and the only reason why I gave it two stars.If you're not into Debra Wilson,then I would suggest staying far away from this one."
3,trip out film,the story was something else. the acting was generic in spots&cliche.but it kept my full attention.
1,Tanika is right on!!!,"This could very well be the worse movie ever made. The writing is grade school at best and all the Black characters are over-sexed and mindless. The white character however, is the most rational one. Now there's a surprise. It's interesting how Black people have finally accepted decades upon decades of stereotypes and now regurgitate them for a buck. This movie makes 'Soul Plane' look like a masterpiece. Okay, maybe not, but just the same, bypass this film and read 'The Challenge of Blackness' by Lerone Bennett. There's a chapter in there entitled 'The Task of the Black Artist' that means just as much today as it did back then."
1,"What the ""BLEEP""?","What in the hell was this? I couldn't even watch the rest of the movie only after watching 20 mins of this crap. I can't believe I wanted to add this movie to my collection of Black films. This was nothing but lesbianism and sex. No story line at all. Junk, junk, junk. Don't get this movie PLEASE."
4,I'VE SEEN WORSE....,"This film had a good story/plot, although at times the acting left lots to be desired. The situations were realistic, but too much emphasis was placed on serveral aspects and should have been toned down a bit.Overall, I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to others."
5,Fantastic knife.,"I work in a professional kitchen in La Jolla, California and this knife has been better than I even expected. It was almost too sharp! I had previously owned global knives but once the edge was lost on them it seemed impossible to get it back. I have had this knife for almost three months and haven't had the need to sharpen it yet, even with everyday, intensive use. If you are looking for the perfect balance of weight, comfort, sharpness, and functionality, this is a great buy."
2,cutting edge rusted quickly,"In spite of caring for this knife properly, the cutting edge rusted quickly...must have been simply a defective knife."
3,alchemy:live,"I had to wait much more than I expected due to postal delays, but in the end the product arrived."
4,Informative,A good tool for research of the Twenties. I would recomment it to anyone who is interested in the history of that era.
3,Great tracks.... okay mix.,"An impressive collection of tracks for Warp and Ninjatune fans alike. What you get with this CD is an extended DJ mix of fine tracks from the libraries of the two aforementioned labels. I should emphasize that you do not get full tracks. Its a good mix I suppose, but mostly I found that much of the Warp material wasn't well served by this format. Trying to fit tracks from ""Tri Repetae"" or ""Selected Ambient Works, Vol. 2"" into a turntablist rave-up.... I just dunno. And as I bought this CD for the Warp material more than for the Ninjatune material, the result quite simply doesn't do it for me. That said, for new listeners to the Warp or Ninjatune sounds, this covers a lot of great territory on one small CD - and so in that sense, this is an excellent sampler."
1,Extreme Wackness,"Bonecrusher simply put is wack. He was able to salvage his first album Attenchun with original production, nice rhymes and guest appearances and came out the gate swinging. This album however is terrible. His rapping skills have declined and he wasn't that good to begin with. The only thing that could save this album is the beats...while the production on most songs are good and bump in the whip...that's it. The choruses are corny (King Kong style...need to switch it up playa), the lyrics are bad...bad as in bad not bad as in good...overall just not a very good product. Not recommended."
4,crunk !!!,"People have to remember this is crunk music lyrics are secondary the beat and the hook is what you should pay attention to so therefore this is a damm good CRUNK !! album .Crunk music is about feeling the beat and screaming the hook dont get crunk albums mixed up with the normal type of rap albums,crunk has its own lane so dont try to compare this album to other types of hip-hop.This is a tight album LONG LIVE THE DIRTY SOUTH !!!!!!!"
4,"Light, frothy, fun . . . and I like it!","Like dessert, it's not enough to build a life on. But fun is itself worthwhile. (Thinking about this, I'll upgrade my review from the '3' I was going to give it.) If you've been taking yourself and the whole business of personal growth too seriously, this book may be just what you need.Gotta go . . . my muse is calling."
5,Unique!,"Probably THE BEST book I've ever read. Truly different ways to look at things, growth, creative ideas etc. I actually savored this by reading a little each day to make it last almost a year! Also got her 2nd book Awe-manac the day it came out!"
2,CONFUSING MUSING,"Totally disorganized with very con""mus""ing, repetitive thoughts.Creativity is all about working on the right side of the brain.This version lacks color, images and creative exercises with examples.The author has some clever ideas, but they all seemmuddled together. I'm half way through and still bored.In reading other comments, it appearsI may have not received the original version? Why did I see one copy advertisedfor over $400.00? . . . I LOVED the Artist's Way but could not justifiably compare this to that."
5,I love those MUSES!!,"Jill Badonsky had a clear vision when she wrote this book - to help struggling & working creatives dig through that yucky junk that clogs up our creative pores and allows our minds to wander, explore & rejuvinate. When you start reading this book & acquaint yourself with the different muses there are some you will relate to more then others - - some WAY more than others. For me, Audacity reigns!! This book has been a true work of what creative expession is all about - it's awesome!! Two enthusiastic thumbs up!"
5,A Really Fun Way to Explore Your Creativity,"I used to think that creativity was just for professional artists, writers and performers. Boy, was I wrong! Jill Badonsky's Nine Modern Day Muses and a Bodyguard helped me to discover that creativity is just another name for having fun. Jill's book is an entertaining and humorous adventure into the creative process. The book is practical and informative with simple and easy exercises that cleverly coaxed me into being creative. I was so busy having fun, I forgot about trying to be creative. In no time, I was amazed at how creative I could be. If you already enjoy your creativity, the Muses will inspire you to more fully explore the inifinite universe of creative possibilities. If you don't think that you are creative at all, I am warning you, the Muses will prove you wrong."
3,This book keeps it simple,"The good thing about this book is that it keeps the retail business simple. The author does not complicate the retail business. He makes book keeping, sales, marketing and inventory management simple and easy to follow. However, this book is not fully comprehensive. If you are starting off in retail or even if you are an experienced pro who's been around for several years you will learn quite a lot of tips and tricks from this book. This book will definitely help you but it will go past it's utility pretty soon. So read this book but don't expect this book to go into serious detail. Overall, my recommendation would be to buy the book. I think it's worth the time and money!"
4,Retail Business Kit for Dummies,I recently opened a small shop in an antiques mall and found this book to be quite helpful. The information is presented in an interesting and easy to use format. The book covers all the basics and is loaded with useful suggestions for marketing your business.
2,"Good read, but too rudimentary","One thing is for sure - if you really intend to start your own retail business, Retail Business Kit for Dummies will not take you far. It is very rudimentary, to say the least. My real disappointment is because of the CD that came with the book, supposedly full of useful forms, reports etc. They looked as if they were written with a typewriter.Anyway, regardless of your profile, I do not think that this book will help you open or run a successful retail business, nor significantly compliment your existing knowledge.However, it does make an interesting read, and offers good common sense advice based on the authors many years in the industry."
4,"good purchase,","lots of great info, arrived in good time. Im working on a business plan, and even this was just a few yrs old, it was in good condition, had the cd with it, and was a great price etc. thanks for listing, and fulfilling the order in a timely manner."
2,Marc Almond with Gypsy Band and Performing Bears,"As they say, Marc bought an apartment in Moscow so he really could be in the very heart of Russia.Unfortunately, that didn't help him - there is no grace in this album. It's much closer to trained performing bears and gypsies than to real spirit of russian music. In some songs Marc sings russian, but his accent is awful and he is dubbed by gypsy band members. Sometimes one russian guy sings very similar to Marc (making an impression he is Marc) but it's so plastic and fake I could barely stand it.In my opinion, Guinness World Records person should be ashamed of making such steps on his way."
3,Educational but a little strange in terms of difficult wording,"This book sure has some pretty difficult words for babies, and one thing I didn't like - one of the poems mentions thiefs on the garden wall (I don't know why would you need to educate your little baby about thieves at this age?) Little peek-a-boo pieces of the book were easily ripped by my baby :) I would give 3 stars to this one, my baby still liked it when I read it for her."
5,A Book for a Lifetime!,"This book is truely excellent. It is divided into catagories from community to place to stewardship, with quotations from well, and less well, known naturalists and other people like Thoreau, Emerson, Jane Goodall, Aldo Leopold, John Muir, Wendell Berry, Wallace Stegner, David Brower, Margaret Mead, Rachel Carson, Willa Cather, Robert Frost, Emily Dickinson, John Muir, Theodore Roosevelt, Darwin, Skakespeare, and so many more. There is an index, so you can look someone's name up and find quotations made by them. There is also a section called ""Selected Biographies,"" which has short biographies of some of the people who wrote the quotations in this book. It is truely a pleasure to read, inspirational, and provides plenty of food for thought. A great book for ""anyone who loves nature - birders, hikers, fisherman, gardeners, backpackers, adventurers..."""
5,No problems,"There is nothing spectacular to this product, it works as it should. No problems and no defects. everything is as described."
1,Cheap Quality and HUGE,"You'll need a trailer sized BBQ grill for this BBQ set! The quality stainless steel is very cheap and the utensils are bulky. I'm not sure that they are truly made of stainless steel, so most likely these utensils will rust. The tongs have a lever that doesn't work well. They don't come with a box to store it in. My package looked like it was already returned by someone else and was retaped up and shipped to me. I'd look around for a set that comes with a storage case and one that's made of higher quality materials. Good luck!"
2,"Slow and inaccurate, not ""instant""","This thermometer is not ""instant"" at all -- it takes over 20 seconds to measure a temperature. The Taylor 9842 ""Professional"", which is about the same price, is much faster.Also, this model is less accurate. Even after being calibrated at 32 degrees as recommended, it mis-measured the temperature of boiling water. The Taylor 9842 was much closer to being accurate (about two degrees too high, taking elevation into account)."
2,Can't recommend.,"If I let the meat get to the recommended temperature as shown by this thermometer, the meat is overdone. I've re-calibrated it according to the directions, but the problem persists. I don't trust the thermometer's readings."
2,big disappointment,"the songs are catchy, but when it comes to the multiplication part, the lady stops singing and just chants with music playing in the background. NOT what I was looking for. :("
4,Attache Travel Pack Triominos,Game is exceptional. Only problem probably will be that the small domino pieces will get lost. Hope someone offers replacement dominoes for the game. I have played the game by myself and even being careful I found domino pieces that I missed putting up. So I count the pieces now but that is time consuming and really should be unnecessary. Still glad I got the game.
5,love the portability,"this game is a classic I have played since I was a kid. I now play it with my kids. I love the portability of this game. The pieces inside are tiny, but we knew that when we bought it. We love how there is a board to put the pieces into. This is a great game to use when teaching math."
4,"Great Product, Great Price",We purchased these 12 Port Patch Panels for our installs if clients do not request or wish to pay the higher price for Leviton... Quality similiar to Leviton at 1/3rd the price. No failures after 30 installs...
4,Good Product,I purchased this product after reading several bad reviews about another brand. The Patch Panel is made of high quality materials and is easy to install and setup.
1,Bad experience,"I bought 2 of these. In the past, I've used Leviton or Siemons. The price for the Tripp Lite panels was significantly lower and I have never had any problem with Tripp Lite power products. None of the terminals on one side of the block (odd numbers jacks) worked. I could only get the pair 1 on each jack to pass. All others showed open. Had the same problem on both panels. Luckily, I only needed 6 ports at each site so I was able to make do. Even if the vendor would replace them, the time to go to the sites and replace them would exceed the value of the product. I will not use them again."
4,Not Bad!!!,"WHile this book seemed a bit tedious for me to get through...i did enjoy it for the most part, especially Petie and Eddie. I am anxious to read another Dianne Hammond book."
3,K&N FIPK Intake for 2002 Tacoma,"I got this intake to replace an Outlaw CAI I had installed previously. I had high expectations since it is from K&N, but was let down. The one I bought is for a 3.4L Tacoma. I had to buy a hole saw kit like the directions said I might since mine has the resonator box, but the directions show it in the wrong location. Also, the way things are lined up, my truck's hoses had to be routed differently and are stretched pretty tight just to get them to fit. The intake sounds great and looks decent, but for the money and brand I expected more. The hole saw part is just ridiculous!"
3,Not Bad For A First Effort,"Hello,I have listened to this a few times now and believe what it is basically a cross between ""Oliver"" and ""Tenderloin"", as say Leslie Bricusse might have written it. It is cute, but sounds very derivative and ""'60s""I enjoyed the commentary at first, but by the third listening, found it very annoying. It is too bad that the tracks were not set up so the talking could be skipped. I am thinking seriously of loading the whole thing on my computer and editing out all the talk and applause.I am glad I bought it, but only as a historic curiosity which makes my Lloyd Webber collection complete. I don't see much future listening."
4,Easy to Install good price,"I bought these for my RZR, they were pretty easy to install and they work great. You will need to install the between the legs strap, if not when you tighten the shoulder straps it will make the lap belt ride high. The latch system can be a little tough to open, but if you keep it oiled it good."
3,Wordy,"Seems wordy to me and doesn't always get right to the point. Seems to make excuses to the ""Judaizers"" for our freedom in Christ. Good book but I've read better books on holiness through grace, since in reality true holiness can only be obtained through grace. Galatians makes this abundantly clear."
5,Wonderful Gift,Bought these cufflinks for my son's birthday and they are beautiful. I will be purchasing additional cufflinks from Cuff Daddy. Came in a nice box as well for gift giving!
5,Excellent Knife,"This 4"" paring knife is easily one of the best available. The grip is well contoured and rests comfortably in the hand. The blade is razor sharp and thanks to a special process of ice-hardening it should remain so for quite some time. For those who will use the knife often enough, it's a good idea to buy the J.A. Henckels TWIN Pro 'S': 10"" Sharpening Steel 32555 260 to help retain the edge almost indefinitely.This is a small lightweight knife that is perfect for cutting cheese, apples, and other small items. Sometimes you not only don't need the heft of a big chef's knife, but only a small nimble blade will do the trick.There are many knives available for a lot less money than the Twin Cuisine series. Unfortunately, cheap knives will never take and hold an edge like this one will. Try this knife just once and you'll be hooked on Twin Cuisine for good."
4,This movie has a better story line than any of the series.,"A great story! Kojak investigates a series of recent killings that involve Russian Jews that worked with the Germans 40 years earlier to help imprison Jews in Hitler's concentration camps. Kojak is tied closely to the case by friends that are in the middle of the case. Susan Pleshette gives a great performance as Kojak's unofficial assistant and possible love interest. Max Von Sydow is, as always, great."
3,How to wear yourself out!,"This was a pretty good cd - I especially liked the variety of music styles, you didn't get too bored with repetitivness. High impact is an understatement! Get ready to get tired!"
5,Sounds like De Falla's lost music,"I am excited to find new music especially when it's good. Turina offers a clearly spanish style of composing that would be at home with Manual De Falla who I am familiar with. Turina is his own man and I hear nothing derivative here, just some deliciously melodic and interesting material. Of course the playing is excellent with wonderful clarity in the wide-range recording."
4,Japanese Taiko Drumming,"This is a band that peforms at Epcot in Disney World frequently. Having seen their show, I purchased this CD, which is one of a number of their CDS they sell there. The live show is almost exclusively drumming with an occassional flute and is excellent.This CD has a larger group with more instruments and it takes a little away from the drumming at times but still this is a very nice CD for fans of drumming in general and Japanese taiko drumming in particular."
4,Glad I read other reviews concerning distortion,"AFTER READING OTHER REVIEWS I AM GLAD I ORDERED THIS IN VHS V. DVD. I WILL SACRIFICE THE ADVANTAGES OF DVD IN ORDER TO GET CLARITY AND NO DISTORTION. THE STORY WAS WORTHWHILE, THE PRODUCTION WELL DONE. I WOULD RECOMMEND DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE CHARACTERS ARE NOT EASILY LIKED. THAT'S THE AUTHOR'S PORTRAYAL OF THEM AND NOT THE DIRECTOR'S FAULT."
5,Recommend,"George Eliot(Mary Anne)'s famous novel. Yes, the story is long and there are so many different characters which make people feel a little bit bored. But, it is a well made TV series. Persuasive actings and beautiful country scenes. I don't think anyone who loves 19th century novels should skip this one."
5,great movie; engrossing; DVD needs program insert,"This is a classic British production, with great performances working a wonderful literary effort.As for the DVD, there was no program insert, which would have helped ""navigation"" tremendously. The DVD is two-sided, meaning the side identification is in tiny, tiny lettering around the circumference of the center core. Without a program insert, it took us a while to determine if we'd seen only one episode, or an entire first side. Frustrating."
2,Disappointing after all the raves...,"I loved the book and had high hopes for this critically-acclaimed Masterpiece Theatre movie, but...Very little of Eliot's humor is present. Much of the casting is poor, esp. Mary Garth, her familiy, Fred and Rosamond."
3,Not for children,"I would place this production in the soap opera genre, BBC-style. The story line does provide fine examples on why anyone considering a hasty marriage should think twice and do their homework! The characters of the doctor and his wife engage in intimate talk and physical relations far too mature for young viewers, in my opinion, and even I chose to fast forward those parts. Had I known those parts were included I wouldn't have purchased this. The main female character is very noble and uncompromising in her grace-filled, benevolent character, which to me was the only redeeming value of the film."
4,middlemarch,"slow but very much of it's time . things did not move fast at that time, so it was worth watching . lovely ! characters are played beautifully. plot was very interesting especially during that era, would and will watch it again."
3,blahzeh,"While this is in the general genre of the type of movies I really like I found this one wanting. To be sure the story line followed the book quite well, but the overall flow and character interest were tedious. Near the end during Dodo's memory sequence the picture quality acutally looked archaic. Not my favorite movie. If you want a good one buy North and South (not the one with Patric Swazye) or Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth."
1,"Great film, horrible DVD transfer",Do not waste your money on this DVD - the distortion will make you dizzy. What a shame that such a great PBS production was so horribly reproduced: my years-old VHS taped from TV is of far better quality than this DVD.
4,Middlemarch,"Loved this movie! Sad story in many ways, but its because of choices people make. George Elliot is a writer that pulls out the true character of people to weave the story. Sometimes the ending is very surprising."
2,Not my thing....,"I normally enjoy period dramas but I found this mini-series to be tedious. Particularly Dorothea...She is such a martyr!! Boring! She seems to want to suffer and the viewer is forced to watch as she shacks up with an old fuddy duddy who treats her badly. Whoopee, I'm having fun now. The doctor's wife is not much better.... He marries an insipid shopaholic who spends his money and treats him poorly.I guess I wanted the series to be about characters I actually LIKED. These people were all sad sacks. 2 stars. Not my thing."
2,"Waiting Eagerly for this DVD to Arrive, Only to be Disappointed with it!!!","Reading all the great reviews on this production I thought this purchase would be worth it.When viewing Middlemarch one can see that BBC spend alot of money making this. The customes are beautiful and the acting is great but one element of this well made production that spoiled it. The passionate sences between the town's new doctor and his beautiful wife.Rent Middlemarch before buying it would be my recommendation.This BBC production has nothing on other BBC productions.Bring on North and South, Pride and Prejudice, Wives and Daughters,Bleak House (2005) David Copperfield (1999) and Our Mutual Friend.Now those are worth your time and worth being added to your collection!!"
1,Not Enjoyable to Watch,"As a huge fan of period films, I was sorely disappointed with Middle March. I must agree with other reviewers who cited the problem with the elongated picture. It was so distracting that I could only stay with the movie for all of ten minutes. In this age of technology, it's difficult to believe that the DVD version of this film couldn't have turned out better. In summary the fact that all the characters were elongated and stretched to the limit, compromised the viewers' attention to the dialogue and the plot line."
2,Dreary print and dreary production,"First, the print. The entire DVD appears to be overexposed by about one stop. The colors are somewhat washed out. It appears to be a poor transfer. I have watched another copy and it has the same problem. It is not a horrible problem and if you don't pay attention to photography you may not even notice it, but it is disappointing if you do.As to the production itself, it certainly is interesting in many respects and a great deal of effort has gone into recreating the period. Unfortunately the same amount of effort did not go into dramatic pacing. This is a slow plodding effort with no clear direction.If you like these period pieces simply because they are period pieces you may like this, but if you are expecting a brilliant print and a sparkling drama you will be disappointed."
2,Depressing,"I usually enjoy period dramas/romances, but this one just dragged on. I kept waiting for the characters' lives to rise above all the sadness, but they did not. There was little plot, and not even a happy ending to make it bearable. I bought it based on positive reviews, but wish I had saved my money."
3,just okay,It was good but a little boring and predictable. still enjpy the british drams tho i am spoiled with the newer dramas that are out now..
4,It's pretty good.,"The DVD itself isn't of the best quality (with good reason..I mean, there's over 5 hours of video on one DVD). It is watchable.There are some scenes I wish they focused more on--like the jewel scene. It's in the first episode, but Dorothea's indecisiveness of accepting the jewels was not played out, but the dinner scene following it was wonderfully done.Anyway, other than a few things I wish they went more in depth in,this is a very good adaptation of the book. I love the cast. Juliet Aubrey is a wonderful Dorothea (although she looks a bit old to play the role). Rosamond and Celia are both as I imagined them to be, and Ladislaw is gorgeous!"
4,Drama Builds with Each Episode.,"The lives of people in a small town in England in the 1800's.Several plots. A young man's wife spends more than he earns. A wealthy man is blackmailed. A woman finds that the man she married is not the nice man she thought he was. A young woman demands her suitor improve his character if he wishes to date her.Visually appealing with pretty: countryside, homes, and costumes. The drama increases with each episode.From the novel by Mary Ann Evans of 1872. She used the pen-name, George Eliot, to get her book published in the man's business world of the time. She prefers Mary Ann. Her appeal is her thought-provoking plots. Her motto: ""Moral thinking is intelligent thinking"".Many scenes are done well; yet this story could be remade even better. See my suggestions under the ""comment"" button below."
4,Great show-excellent story line,"This is one DVD my husband and I devoured. SO many plots and story lines all intertwined to make a great storyline. I have just purchased the book as I liked the movie so much.I gave it four stars. I would have given it five if it had a few less swear words. They were mild, but I really enjoy watching shows such as ""Pride and Prejudice"" which keep crass language to a minimum. It is not as bad, however, as Vanity Fair. THe musical score was great which is something I always enjoy in these BBC shows, and something in which I was greatly dissappointed in ""Vanity Fair.""This really is a captivating story and a well done program. Great price as well for the number of hours of enjoyable television."
2,"Good miniseries, horrible transfer","The dvd transfer is absolutely horrible. I received two copies, one a replacement, and both were very poor transfers. On side B, the transfer became even worse. Also, the dvd is supposed to be widescreen, my two copies were full frame. Do not buy this dvd unless you are assured that the distributor has fixed the problem. Amazon was very understanding about the problem and allowed me to return both copies. However, they cannot guarantee the dvd quality."
2,Didn't Like!,I watch a lot of the BBC mini series but was very disappointed in this one. There were so many characters (extended family members but what family?) and personally I didn't feel like they introduced them very well. It dragged on and then the end came quickly (when it finally came) and I wasn't sure who had ended up with whom in one case. Probably just me. I had seen that this was rated 8 1/2 stars but not in my opinion. I hope that means that North and South is rated 10 stars!!! Now that was good.
1,"Ho hum, boring alert!","If you want to see suffering, on top of boring, on top of martyrdom without doing much good - this movie's for you. If you're otherwise looking for entertainment, then look elsewhere because all this movie will do is to waste your valuable time and regret ever having bought this movie in the first place."
1,The Worst BBC Production I've Seen,"I tried 4 times to watch this movie and when I finally made it through it, I felt as though I had wasted my time. This has got to be the worst BBC production I have ever seen; and I am very fond of BBC. The story dragged on and on. It jumped around too much. The plot was almost non existent. There were too many characters that seem to be of no importance. I won't go on, even though I could. Save your time, don't even bother to watch this movie. It looked like it had promise but when I finally got to the end I discovered, I was wrong."
1,Horrible movie,"Couldn't wait to be over. Characters are ridiculous and frankly, repulsive excuses for human beings. I hoped it developed the love story of the two main characters better and not wasted the majority of the film with the rest of them."
2,boring,"the litmus test for a movie adapted from a book is whether it makes you want to read the book. this film fails that test. the book may not be to blame for this - i've seen enough poor adaptations to know this. but the film was, quite frankly, boring. i've never read george eliot, and middlemarch won't change that."
2,In the middle.....of potential satisfaction,"I've heard that this version of this period piece is top-notch; based on these reviews, I'd love to have the DVD, but it does not offer English sub-titles, so that lets me out. Too bad; another sale lost!"
4,A Fine Accomplishment,"The genius of this book is no accident: like a seamless tracking shot through the man, the work, and the legacy, it reveals a deft portrait of Cassavetes' contribution to cinema that, among other rewards, will deeply enrich film lovers' enjoyment of the maverick auteur's influential work. But, of course, the drama behind the scenes is often even more enthralling and, in many ways, it is actually Cassavetes' legacy as an actor that is most indelible and fascinating. Check, check it out..."
2,A Miramax fairy tale,"Since it was published by Miramax and approved by Gena Rowlands, you can imagine the finished product. Harvey Weinstein, please stand up... Al Ruban as Captain Kirk? A fairy tale written to perpetuate Gena Rowlands' version of the myth. Cassavetes is probably laughing his behind off..."
1,snooozer,"Not sure why I picked this book up. Knowing next to nothing about Cassavetes before attempting this book, I decided halfway through it, that I don't care who Cassevetes is. Not my cup of tea at all."
5,MGF is terrific!,"MGF is a rocking, weird, hip band. Part performance artists, part popstars and part freaks! But check out Rollercoaster and My Ex-Girlfriend. After you have thoroughly enjoyed those tracks, you will be blown away by the rest - great party music and stuff to make your friends blush!"
4,a black metal essential,"This album has incredible energy. The band sounds a bit like the more recent releases from Dimmu Borgir. The guitars are heavy, the drums are tight, the keyboards are scary, and the vocals are insane,what more could you ever want from a band?? One of the best CDs I've bought in a long time. Track 4 and 5 seem to be the best in my opinion. If you like black metal or anything crazy, buy this album immediately. They're from Norway, you know it has to be good."
1,Poorly-manufactured: A RJ45 ethernet cable only fits in one side,"Its difficult to know if the poor manufacturing of the product I received (the N032-001) is unusual or not. One RJ-45 Ethernet cable fits very snugly into one side of the connector, but no RJ-45 could ever fit into the smaller-cutout on the other side of the connector. I'm very surprised - this sort of thing has not happened before. BTW, this is a metal-covered connector; most that I've seen in the past just look plastic."
3,Light on the Content,This is a big showy book with a bright graphic cover but I found the interior coverage of various characters too light for serious research or reading.This may make a good gift book for someone just getting started but I recommend either The Superhero Book: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Comic-Book Icons and Hollywood Heroesby Gina Misiroglu or The Slings and Arrows Guide to Comic Guide Second Edition for the more serious fan/collector.
2,Careful,If you're getting this book for hardcore reference material I would be careful. I literally had the book 5 minutes and discovered a handful of mistakes.Ex.-Jim Lee's entry has the best selling X-Men #1 as being released in 2001 instead of 1991.-The timeline has Sandman ending in 1997 when it was actually 1996.If you buy this book get it for light reading. Do not use it for quoting comic fact until you check the validity of what you are using. Like I said.. I noticed these two mistakes after skimming the book for 5 minutes. I am afraid of how much more I will find once I start digging in.
2,not what i expected for,"First of all i was looking for a book that describes each super heroe's style, character, super powers in detail, even i expected a scala or a chart showing his/her powers, intelligence, agility, dexterity out of say, 10 or 100 what ever. But none is available, just a brief explanation of how he /she is created, and etc. No description of his/her adventures, friends, the very popular speciality etc.I bought this book with 2 other books ""The superhero book"" (visible ink production) and ""500 comic book villains"" (Baron's production) and none of them satisfied me.However this book is the only one which provides all superheroes with ""pictures"" other books doesnt even provide picture for all characters but some mostly known ones.i dont recommend this product for those who is familiar with the super heroes but to those who knows nothing about comics."
5,The History of Comics,"I bought this book because I wanted a guide of comics but all the comics, marvel, dc, image, dark horse, press, etc, and this book has that."
4,back to the basics,This is step by step good old fashioned working out. If you work out on a regular basis and want to add strength training to your routine - i highly recommend this video
5,duckie treats,"these ""duckie treats"" are wonderful. Our ten year old Chesapeake Bay Retriever developed food allergies and is now on a very restricted diet. Gone are his old dog bones and his favorite treat of a bit of bread (yes, he's a bread dog). With his ""duckie treats"" he barely notices that he's missing out on his bread, or we can at least distract him. He absolutely loves them. The only complaint is that the biscuits are rather small for a big dog; he usually gets two at a time. But overall this is a really really great product."
3,happy,"Brought for friend, was very happy with the delivery time, and condition that it was received, he has already asked me for the next volumes."
5,Antler chandelier looks great in my cabin,"This chandelier looks great in my cabin entry way. It shipped very quickly, and although the big box had some rough shipping marks, nothing seemed to be damaged. I thought that I may need some extra cord and chain, but it included more than enough. The top / vertical antlers attach to the bottom horizontal antlers & lights with a long rod that screws into the bottom assembly. It didn't screw in tight and wobbled / had a bit of play where they meet together. I figured it would be hanging above everybodys heads and wasn't going to create any problems. Overall I am very happy with this chandelier."
4,Great Cheep Pan,"I purchased this to use almost exclusively to make eggs. It works great for this purpose. The pan is not too large not too small. I can cook two eggs sunny side up in it with out issue.I do not have any other nonstick cook ware, I prefer allclad or other stainless cookware. It is foolish to purchase the high priced nonstick if it gets scratched up or is less non-stick you are screwed. With this one I can replace it in a year if something happens."
2,Too small to be of practical use,"I received the pan from Amazon just today and have decided to send it back. It is a well made pan, but my issue is the actual size. It is much much smaller than advertised. I couldn't see myself putting it to any use in my kitchen. I could make 1 egg sunny side up, but since I don't like eggs that way, I'm sending it back. You could purchase 10 -1/4th inch pan which actually has an 8"" base."
5,Great Purchase,This book was out of print and not due back until April 2010. So I needed ASAP for a book study. I love the book and thankful for the speedy delivery.
2,2 stars because the previous 2 ones were real good,"but this one is a lame reproduction of the the big lebowskii know it is very very hard to write, so my respect for that. but this novel is not like cactus killer. sorry, but a brilliant star fading"
1,Worst movie ever!,This is the worst movie ever. I feel I just wasted 2 hours of my life! Do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie! The story has no cohesion and if Aragon is your draw - she is barely in the movie. This movie seems like it was made by an 8th grader.
1,iPad viewing,"I had bought this video from the Amazon store, downloaded it to my IPad. Thought I would be able to stream itTo my large screen tv,did not work. The powers to be do not want this to happen, am totaly disstisatifid."
1,PE PE LA PEW HAS NOTHING ON THIS !,This movie is a waste of time believe it is Canadian sorry to see they can make a stinker as bad as hollywierd OMG it's crapWatch The Guard with Don Cheadle much better movie !
5,Nice Bracelet,"I am well pleased with this bracelet, the knot work is excellent and the stones are consistent in size and color. It has a generous fit that is not too loose, not too tight. I highly recommend it as a gift or a personal purchase."
4,A Gay Mystery worth reading!,"I've often looked for a gay murder mystery who done it. Finally I found something worth reading. It's not a dumbed down novel at all. It's full of plots twists and turns with characters who you really get to know. It's nice to see characters interacting with one another who are gay even if they do go for blackmale and the shady side of life sometime...okay most of the time. Very few women mentioned in the book, and I give it four stars because I was able to figure out who did it close to the end of the book and because the ending left me a bit speechless and upset."
5,just perfect,"the quality is really good, and price,i really enjoy it, especially when you got received everything on your home adress!"
5,correcto,Tanto el envio como las paquete llegaron bien . La calidada de las Reeds Royal es ya conocida por todos.
3,I didn't really like this,"I gave it a 3 because it's Rico and they're amazing but the 3s are really hard for me to use. I feel like I'm using a lot of air to get the sound out. Maybe I need a new mouthpiece, but for now, these will stay in the box."
4,OK for a beginner sax player,"These reeds work just fine for beginner/intermediate saxophoe players. There are better reeds out there but until you know the difference, don't invest in the ""better"" reeds as all reads break easily."
4,savy shopper,"I wish I would have ordered more than 1 package,he will be needing them anyway. The shipping was more than the reeds!"
1,edges too thin,"bought the 2.0 three pack, and every single one of the reeds came with the edges broken (useless) even though they were all in a sealed package."
1,Horrible cheap reeds,"These reeds sound great out of the box, but do not last long at all and lose their shape very quickly.I recommend getting vandoren reeds because they last alot along and sound much better."
4,Good quality,This is a well made item. The stitching is very well done and the materials are great. I'd gladly paid more had it been made in the U.S.
1,Doesn't fit any of my hubs or routers,"none of them fit in any of my ethernet ports!, they are very tight and won't clip no matter how hard I push."
1,"Bad Connector - Does not ""CLICK-IN""","I am a network administrator for a medium sized non-profit. I have made thousands of Cat5e/RJ-45 terminations in my career but I must say these connector are no good. They simply don't ""click-in"" to the wall or device jack like they should leaving you with an easy to pull out connection. When closely compared to connectors of other brands the design flaw is obvious. The clip on the bottom of the connector is flatter than most others again causing the connector to not click into the jack. Stay away from these and save yourself the headache. I have also used these from Amazon:RJ45 CAT-5 E (8P8C) Crimp Connector solid, (100 Pcs Per Bag)which work great."
3,Not sure if these are really Tripp-Lite?,"Was sent package (repackaging from bulk, maybe?) the sticker on the bag said ROHS compliant-silly because all that's in here is copper and plastic- but theres nothing to indicate they are Tripp-Lite. 'made in china' on the bag too.They do seem to be good quality, and I've only terminated one cable and one crossover cable so far. Theres just nothing to say these are Tripp-Lite, and the generics are slightly cheaper. I got these for my job, otherwise I wouldnt care."
5,Good quality connector.,"Crimping these things is an absolute pain. However, that is my fault because I am a relative novice with low-voltage wiring. When you do get all of the wires in perfectly, and in the correct order, each connector worked the first time, without issue and hasn't failed since. Once the connectors are on, they are sturdy and feel very secure. No complaints. Good product."
5,Rj45 heads,"I was learning to make my own cat5e cables and these did the trick for me. No bad ones in the bunch, I will probably order more in the future."
2,Really Tripp-Lite?,"I have worked in IT for many years, and have had good experiences with Tripp-Lite products. I don't think these are actually made by Tripp-Lite. The bag just said ebay on them, and the tips do not say Tripp-Lite anywhere...I know that's not definitive, but the poor quality is the other thing that makes me think they are not. Most of what the other reviewers are saying is true. These do not click properly, and have to be crimped a couple times to get really good connections. I will say that I have not had any issues with them not fitting in ports, but I wouldn't be surprised. The only reason I'm giving these 2 stars is because they will make a connection.Bottom line, if these are Tripp-Lite, they aren't living up to the name, and this is a classic case of you get what you pay for. Spend the extra money and go buy some Belkin tips."
3,Won't stay in the jack,"These keep falling out of half the jacks I put them into. The locking mechanism does not work and as a result these connectors fall out and loose connection all the time. They work as far as internal connection goes, but the physical connection into the wall is a pain. Also, beware what you buy from SoDo Tek. They were really helpful, but it turned out their info was really misleading... I ordered solid connectors and stranded connectors from them. When they showed up at my door I couldn't tell them apart, there was no invoice to tell me, and when I contacted them, they said they were universal connectors. Long story short, I'm stuck with a bunch of mediocre ""universal"" connectors that only work on stranded cable. Beware."
1,Does not work.,I bought these and after putting on my first cable I noticed that the cables would NOT stay plugged in. The are too cheap and the plastic lever is not strong enough to hold them in. So I sent them back and got some others that work.
5,Working perfectly so far,"I'm a newbie to making CAT5 patch cables, and every cable I've made so far (that I did not miswire) worked perfectly. These are marked for stranded wire.I am using the TrendNet crimper, and haven't had any problems with these connectors. They are MUCH cheaper than anything from Home Depot. Unlike the Ideal brand from the Depot, these are a one-piece connector. The ones from the Depot (about $1 each) are two-piece designs. I couldn't get a single working cable from those.Tripp Lite works great!"
5,"relaible, secure connectors...","I use a decent Klein crimping tool with these and get perfect results all of the time. I've used the no-name, ""bucket-o-connectors"" brand in the past and have gotten burned with unreliable connections, wasting my time and money... not to mention frustrated clients. I highly recommend these and have not experienced any of the negative issues posted here. Maybe they learned from the feedback??"
3,"Less Bright, Bulb Slightly Less Hot.",The xenon bulb was surprisingly less bright and the tint it gives is more yellowy than my 20w halogen counterparts. It looks like this 20W xenon bulb is as bright as the 10W halogen ones I have. Only difference is it seems to be lasting longer than the halogen ones as they usually go out in a month or two. This has been running for a few months strong now. It is also noticeably less hot than the halogens.
1,not as listed,"Xenon light bulbs may be used to replace Halogen light bulbs in all applications. Xenon bulbs burn cooler, last for 4x as long as standard halogen, produce bright white light, and may be touched with bare hands when changing - not able to touch with bare hands when changing -"
3,"Okay, but not as bright as the rest of our bulbs...","These bulbs arrived on time and in fine condition. However, after I installed two of them in our under counter lights, I noticed that they are not as bright as the rest of our lights even though they are the same in terms of being 12 volt, 20 watt, T-3, G4 base bulbs. There is a noticeable difference but overall, they are fine. But I would probably try different ones the next time we need a few replacements."
1,Not worth the money,"We bought this for our 10 year old son. It arrived with missing parts. The controller was defective and was smoking with the first use. Now we are out the cost of this product because you can't return it to amazon...it has to go through the manufacturer. I'm waiting for a reply from them. My son was very disappointed, as were we."
2,quite a let down,"I think that the blimp was flawed from the beginning. I purchased it as a gift for my little brother. I had both blimps filled with helium and because we have vaulted ceilings both balloons got stuck up in the crevices of our ceiling without any way to get it down. The propellors that move the balloons have no means of lowering them. As the helium wears off and the blimp can float at a lower height, it could be fun... but until then, we have a blimp and UFO stuck up in our rafters... my brother was underwhelmed... so was I."
3,"Neat concept, poor execution","Well, when you buy low you sometimes get old stock. This is what we received. The 9 volt battery had corroded, and the 3 volt battery was dead. Add about [...] to the price of this blimp, because you'll likely have to replace the batteries upon arrival. The seller holds that responsibility, but the manufacturer is the one who created a balloon that has motors that won't power the craft downward. As some have indicated, it goes up and stays up. It's truly a fun concept that my 9 year old became fascinated with after watching Pixar's ""Up."" They have a blimp in the movie. This, however, is a big mylar balloon with underpowered motors. The lights, though, are very cool, and all being said, he played with this for a few weeks. Honestly, it was inexpensive to buy, it is more durable than I would have thought, and my son enjoyed it anyway. I just wish the batteries had not been leaking acid into the styrofoam when we got it."
1,Junk,"It was fun for a couple hours, but 2 days later balloon deflated, on-off switch on the gondola fell inside and top peace of antenna broke off (made of low quality steel)."
5,Brilliant!,"Jazz superb! Proof of a most versatile and extremely accomplished musician!I think jazz fans and Randy Bachman fans would both enjoy this. I'm both, and I did!"
2,Good Movie - Bad Tape!,"I really enjoyed the movie itself, however the tape quality was very poor. This needs to be remastered before being released. Now I can deal with some scratchy video, but when I can barely hear and understand the audio, then there's a problem."
2,Sterling Silver Dark Blue Sapphire Celtic Knot Bracelet,"This bracelet is very cheesy, for the Price.According to picture you expect better quality. Than you email them to send it back and they don't return your email. Remember when you order this product, you have to return it to the seller,not amazon!!!"
3,A Little Too Tidy For This Reader...,"Known for her works on women's spirituality and natural healing, Diane Stein has written what could be called a compassionate Goddess-centered guide to death, dying, and grief. Part New Age spirituality, part standard grief psychology, part mythological teaching, this book might have us believe that Stein has already been there. How else could she speak with such certitude about what awaits us all:""We all come from Mother, who is aMother to all, and women are madein her image. At death all souls shedthe physical body and descended to theunderworld for rest, learning, furtherhealing, and reunion with those gonebefore. All souls undergo this process""(46).For some, who are raging at the sudden death of one deeply loved and who are not ready to hear that for everything there is a season, On Grief and Dying might just be too compassionate and gentle to bear."
3,Only for Historians,"As a returning adult student I feel this book was possibly the logical choice by the instructor but not a good one. 80% of the book focuses on politics, battle and hierarchy. Very little covers the daily life and true grit of the Aztecs who were not nobles, rulers or warriors. The writing was hard to follow due to elaborate usage of names for every imaginable ruler/God and Goddess in their civilization. I feel it was very dry and all in all it was written for persons with past knowledge of the subject matter. I previewed a National Geographic book on the Aztecs in order to parlay into this dry and lavish presentation on politics and battles. Unless you have to read it I dont recommend it."
3,aztec,"i got this thinking it was have picture, i was goign to use it as a reference for my tattoos i was getting. but it's very interesting with tons of information about the aztecs."
2,"OK, but not great",Lots of nice pictures of Aztec art but the writing is boring and there is not enuf archaeology. Try Smith's The Aztecs instead.
5,fantasically wild!!,"Mitch Lassiter and Nicole Britton have known each other for years but neither have ever attempted to act on the chemistry that simmered between them. But when their mothers requested they go to an island resort to participate in a competition to win money for a special charity, they both agree.However Mitch plans to use this as his chance to act on his desire for Nicole not knowing Nicole herself has her own lustful agenda for him. Their fantasies are wild indeed!The passion is hot in book #4 of Fantasies Inc which wraps up an exciting mini series. Ms Denison once again delivers a fantastic keeper for me!!"
5,Captures the Heart and Soul of the Polonaise,"This album was the first Chopin I heard over 35 years ago and I have loved it ever since. It brims with fire, poetry and zeal. There's a certain rightness about Brailowsky's performance that has always made these renditions of the Polonaise my personal favorites. I love the heart and soul he pours into each one."
2,Bad sound and harsh playing,"I didn't care for this recording. It was made in the 1960's and the sound is harsh; it also seems like Brailowsky was banging on the piano as hard as he could. I recommend this CD for anyone who wants to acquire all the polonaises at a cheap price. The polonaises are kind of corny and they aren't Chopin's best work, in my excessively humble opinion. So, if you've never heard the polonaises, I guess you could try this CD. But if you want top quality, go somewhere else."
3,Dense but informative,"Professor Doyle captures the intricacies of France leading to the French Revolution. His piece can be somewhat dense in parts which further detracts from the subject when mixed with the several grammatical and spelling errors contained within. While the style and format could be improved, the book is filled with useful information. Worth the read if you can get past the mildly annoying inaccuracies."
1,It's a fake. As common for the author.,Don't waste your money with a book you'll drop after ten mins. The author likes to use titles like the one of this book EVEN IF HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MILITARY AND MOST OF ALL OF SAS. IF CHECK THE AUTHOR'S OTHER BOOKS REWIEW YOU'LL FIND FOR SURE SOMEONE ELSE COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS.
1,I should of listened to Chi Shopper,"Garbage is right...the blade will not stay in the handle...I opened the package, assembled the saw and instantly realized that I'd been had...it's on the way back to Amazon...how can Exacto sleep at night, selling junk like this?"
5,Fabulous tool for what it is intended!!!,"I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about! I have used one of these for over 5 years with never a problem, and it is still razor sharp! Of course, I use it for detail work on guitar inlays and other tiny projects. If you expect to use this for cutting 2x4's, I suppose you would be disappointed. I tend to use the right tool for the job at hand, and this is the right tool in doing what I do. I would recommend this to anyone who has the sense to use it properly!"
5,Worth The Investment,"This set would have to be considered to be a low-to-mid priced drum mic kit. You can find sets by CAD and others that are on the order of a hundred bucks less for this many mics but they can't compete with this Audix set for perfomance or quality. The kick drum mic in this kit goes lower and has better transient response than its competition. The condensers in this set are also a very good value with smooth extended highs. To really beat this set, be prepared to spend double the cost of this set."
2,Sound Track,Way too much background music...not enough of the Christmas music that was in the movie. The songs Brenda Lee and others were not included. Very disappointing! (and it was expensive!!!&^%$#@??**!)
5,Best Christmas CD,"This was the CD I always wanted. All the music as it is on the movie ""Home Alone"". It is great and I recommend this CD to the fans of the movie or just to have some great Christmas music for the holidays. Loved the CD, service from sender and Amazon."
3,If you're a fan of the score...,..then it's advisable leave this edition be and get the score to the sequel as it contains all the same themes only better. I'm not talking about the Album or the standard score release that has been available for many years. I mean the brand new Varese Sarabande limited edition Home Alone 2 score on 2-discs with a massive booklet containing loads of info about John Williams music.It may not have any of the classic Xmas songs on it that this CD does but fans of Williams will know that the score to Home Alone 1 and 2 will fill any house in the world with real Xmas cheer. The new double-disc set of the Home Alone 2 soundtrack contains every tiny little cue of music he created and even some unused themes.Though if you're not a serious collector and only want to put this on as your family tucks into their turkey then go right ahead and buy it. Any CD with such beautiful Xmas cheer is a good purchase.
3,Liked it,It was pretty good but then not as real as the original movies.Big Fan of the Home Alone 1 & 2 only ! My family rewatch them every year since the two Original movies came out.
5,great cd,this is a great cd to listen when doing almost anything. i had bought it for my sister for Christmas and she has been listening to it 24-7 when studying for her college midterms. great cd i would recommend it
5,Wonderful Williams,"A real holiday pleasure. The movie comes alive in your mind, seriously. John Williams rocks!"
5,amazing experiments/tests,my son asks for each new season as it comes out - - The TV series is so well done and I would much rather have my son watching this thought provoking series than a mindless shows.
4,great fun to watch,this is a lot of fun to watch and i love the fact amazon lets you watch just the episodes you want. Mythbusters always great to watch.
5,Wisconsin,"My 2 year old son loves everthing to do with the Disney Pixar Cars movie characters, and he loves his Shake N' Go racetrack, he plays it continuously. I wish we could find Chick Hicks and some of the other characters in the Shake n' Go series. It's good for their coordination, colors and learning to say the names of the characters. These cars are very durable, but you do have to remember to turn them off before you go to bed at night, otherwise they go through the batteries like crazy."
2,Conceptual Confusion,"Culler offers a thoughtful analysis on many areas of literature in a brief, basic style. His discussion of imagery was the most helpful portion of the book; however, the very dry style makes the book painful to read, coming off like a philosophy text, with the same broad, conceptual style. The reader can walk away very confused or with a message Culler never intended. Probably not a good idea for students looking for a clear explanation of literary theory or for anyone searching for information on schools of literary theory, since Culler doesn't mention them."
2,Not Italian,"I have been trying to find a salad spinner that is NOT made in China. From the description, I had the impression that this was made in Italy--but it isn't. It is made in China. It is also not big enough to store large red leaf lettuce or a head of iceberg lettuce. Amazon graciously accepted the return."
2,Not recommended,"The cover constantly falls off when spinning, and if the lettuce is not sitting perfectly even inside, it doesn't spin right. Kind of like a washing machine that is out of balance... Also there is nothing holding it down on the counter so it will slide all over the place if you dont put your full body weight on it."
3,"It works, but the OXO is a better product","The lid simply doesn't fit very well: if you're looking to spin something *in* water, water will squirt out the side. It's not a pleasure to use, as it does not feel like a well-made device. However, it's lasted for 5 years of periodic use in our household, so that's not so bad.And yes, it does dry greens."
5,Buddha Audiophile,"Just got an ipod nano for Christmas and with the addition of this CD it made life a whole lot sweeter. This Cd is amazing!! The best thing about these compilations is you can really float away in your own universe to really feel true bliss. Never have I experienced music like this before. Got into the Buddha Bar Cd's with Vol. 1-7 and found Siddharta as the icing on the cake. It's great to hear diverse sounds from all over the world. Spirit of Buddha brings this to you and it doesn't all sound the same like most CD's. If you enjoy trance, dance, and relaxation with some really hot sounding grooves, get this CD you wont be disappointed. The music covers all spectrums of the world, many of which I have only envisioned with this music...but oh what beautiful visions they are."
4,The book to read before starting a photography business.,"Ann Monteith clearly sets out the various issues related to establishing a wedding photography business, whether it be a fully equiped full-time studio business or a weekend, on-location service. She explains the types of business structures (sole proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, etc.) and their advantages and disadvantages for the wedding photographer. She also devotes whole chapters to the following subjects: -Marketing objectives -Business Location -Product (album) design and presentation -Pricing services and products, and more!The second half of this book contains profiles of currently established wedding photographers who explain their business strategies and photographic styles. These profiles include examples of the photographers' works - collections of wedding photographs which are a joy to browse through and which lend ideas to the aspiring wedding photographer or established professional."
4,Elfing Great!,Thank you Amazon for pressuring me to download this. It was enjoyable while I baked Christmas cookies! I recommend it if you like jazz or loved Elf!
5,Guaranteed to make you smile,"I bought it for the version of ""Baby it's cold outside"" but ended up loving the CD. It's a great mix of upbeat, secular Christmas music."
4,only one shame,"It's a shame they didn't include ""Auld Lang Syne"" by Zooey Deschanel. That always gives me goosebumps on that part of the movie!!"
4,where the cheer at?,"this movie has an awesome soundtrack, Leon Redbone is very cool. I got a real nice price and fast friendly service here. So if you enjoy being treated right Check this sight out."
3,Zooey Deschanel,The album has a lot of great material but most can be picked up off other albums. Get this one for Zooey Deschanel. Kind of pricey for one song but I think it was worth it.
4,not too shabby,"The main reason I bought this CD is because I wanted the song ""baby it's cold outside"". However, the version on this CD is kind of weird. It was not what I expected. Not only are the lyrics slightly different, the voices singing it are a little different as well... but still a good CD nonetheless."
3,it's okay,"It's okay for a Christmas cd. Love the music choices, but many are shortened, which is the reason for one less star than I would've given had they been full songs."
5,You must buy this album!,This is Christmas fun at it's best! These are peppy versions of some great classic holiday songs. This album (and Vince Guaraldi's Charlie Brown Christmas album) are our two most played albums in December!
4,Great Christmas Tunes,"Zooey's ""Baby, its cold outsid"" is the best Ive ever heard. Just a fun Christmas CD!"
3,Bought it mostly for one song,"Another instance where I only had the option to buy a whole album for the one song I wanted, but Zoey Deschanel's voice on ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"" is very much worth it!"
5,Cheers!,"This is a great album! It has a lot of fun cheery, holiday songs that add a nice background noise."
5,great cd,An all-around fun cd with upbeat songs that remind me of the hilarious movie every time I listen to them
4,baby its cold outside,ok does anyone else think Zooey needs her own cd. her song is the only reason i would buy this cd. i agree that her and Will do it better together though/ but she soo needs her own cd i am surprised someone didnt get smart when they first heard her. gosh all those people have money and no brains. what a waste of talent.
5,Fun music!,Nice CD to listen to around the holidays...some of the songs make you crack a smile because you think of Elf and his silliness. Got the order quickly and in good order.
3,Not Good Enough,"I got these for my 5 year old nephew. I thought great I can control the sound. But, it didn't take long for my nephew to figure out how to turn up the volume control on his own. And, after a while he complained that they hurt his ears."
4,A page turner from start to finish......,"Excellent read. I started it on the plane heading on vacation, finished late evening. The author really kept my interest nearly through to the end, though it seemed to end a bit flat......a great read nevertheless. I'll be looking for the next one out from Hanstein."
2,monotone tome,a disbarred lawyer and his delinquent son are both acccused of the same murder.the protagonist's quiet determination is rendered in a tediously depressing and nearly emotionless tone and the pacing is ploddingly big booted.
5,For the Meshuggah fan,This DVD is of fantastic quality and the live footage seems to be recorded straight off the board so the audio sounds excellent. If your a fan of Meshuggah this is a must have.
5,"Hip-Hoppers, See what ELSE your Sub-woofers can do.",E.Power Biggs donated this magnificent Flentrop Organ to Harvard University Adolphus Busch Hall in 1958. Biggs plays it for all it's worth.I first heard the beautiful analog version in 1975. The digital version lives up to its ancestry. It is inspirational and at the same time simply mind-blowing.
3,"its ok, but...","If you're looking for a purist interpretation of Bach, than this CD is for you. Biggs's rendition of these most popular Bach organ works are technically flawless, but lacking inspiration on part of the performer. Biggs plays like a musicologist, caring more about the technical aspects of historical accuracy, and less about infusing his performance with GUSTO."
4,What's happened to the wonderful music?,"While I'm delighted to finally have all of these first season episodes to watch whenever I want to, I'm very upset that much of the music that was part of the show when it originally aired is gone. Laura's wonderful drunken rendition of ""Satisfaction"" from ""Hearts of Steele"" is totally missing, and the song played during ""Steele Trap"" has been changed. There are other missing bits of music as well. This doesn't bode well for later season collections to have the original music, such as ""Steele Trying"" with Tony Bennett's wonderful songs.I hope that if enough of the show's fans complain we'll get the *right* music in the next collections. I'd be willing to pay a bit more to get the episodes as they aired instead of edited musically."
4,Cleverly done,The pilot episode was cleverly done-explained how it all came to be. Zimbalist and Brosnan have a nice special manner with each other.
5,Still love Remington Steele,"I was so excited to hear that my beloved 80's show Remington Steele was coming out on DVD. I was so excited to get the DVD of the first season that I watched all of them over the course of a weekend. I loved every minute of it!! I also enjoyed the extras, but missed Stephanie Zimbalist in them. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who was a fan, and anyone who wants to be!!"
4,Pre-Bond Bond,"From the beginning of this role, one can see the Bond-like qualities that made Pierce Brosnan a natural for the role of James Bond. As Remington Steele he is smooth, street smart, gains others' confidence easily, thinks quick on his feet, and, above all, smiles and maintains his cool no matter what. While not quite as action-packed (or explosive-packed) as the Bond series, this is great entertainment."
1,Don't like double sided discs.,"A great show! However, I won't buy a set of double sided discs again. I've had too many problems in the past as far as the durability of these type dvds and I don't want the hassle.I'd rather do without them or buy when they come out with a single sided disc version if ever."
5,I Love it.....but I'm a Pierce Brosnan Fan!,"I'ts good to be able to see the series again, and for the fans of Pierce Brosnan, like me, it's a good idea to buy the DVD's I just hope they don't make you wait too long to release all the seasons!!"
3,Excellent show; disappointing DVD quality,"I loved the show, and was delighted to be able to dump all my homemade VHS tapes. However, the quality of the DVD was not up to expectations - some scenes were blurry and broken up, really basic menu selection. Seemed like they did the minimum to get this into DVD (but of course I would rather have this quality than nothing at all!)"
3,Great Series--Poor Package,"This series which I loved when it was on TV has been transferred to DVD with less than crisp picture--I believe this could have been done better. For example, Moonlighting is a much superior picture on DVD.Also, I don't like the necessity of turning over the discs, and the fact that the discs are not labeled except for small print around the middle I have to read with a magnifying glass!So 2 stars deducted from an otherwise nice reissue."
2,So Disappointing!,"The series is a delight and I have enjoyed all the episodes that I have seen. Problem? There are three episodes listed on the package that do not appear on any of the discs! There is one missing from disc 3, and two missing from disc 4."
1,Damaged DVD's,"We ordered a lot of TV Series at Christmas, and have just opened this. All the discs are scratched in exactly the same spot, looks like something happened during packaging, but can not return them because the return date has passed, word of warning open right away to check for flaws and avoid disappointment, and wasting your money."
5,wonderful gardening book,"I highly recommend this book for those gardening in the coastal south. I wore my first one out, I used it so much!"
1,Please DON'T BUY this type of feeder!,"This type of feeder is a death trap to small birds!We put a similar feeder [with squirrel-proof caging] up in our yard, hoping to deter the squirrels, and it did.Sadly, we lost 3 sparrows in the process. So many little birds clammered into the feeder, that when something spooked them, and they all tried to get out at once, 3 of them broke there necks in the mad rush. That is NOT acceptable!We immediately took it down and trashed it.I'd rather put up with the squirrels than lose even ONE bird!This type of feeder should be OUTLAWED!"
2,WORKS....BUT BIRDS ARE SCARED OF IT,NO SQUIRRELS CAN GET IN ...BUT BIRDS ARE SCARED OF IT.GREAT MADE PRODUCT THO.
3,Small Squirrels love it.,"The grey suirrels are gone, but the small red ones, that I hadn't seen around too much before, get get in and scratch at the bottom two perches. All the paint is gone on those two feed holes. I had a twirl a squirrel on my last feeder, so I put that on with this one. The small squirrels hang on the outside of the cage and, if they don't fall off, wait for it to stop twirling and then go in. The paint/green coating is all scratched off of the cage now too. I've only had it for about a month. I also have (2) cardinals and have not seen them in there yet."
2,Oops! Have purchased 4 of these.....,and am not happy with the quality on ANY of them. I bought similar perhaps 5 years ago and the difference in quality is very noticeable. would not spend this amount of money again on this no-squirrel feeder.
5,1'st time for everything.,"In the beginning, Ms. kirk's book was harder to believe than a Hollywood fantasy but as you race towards finding out what happens you know the wildest things are possible and do happen.Pure Serendipity, and a wealth/health of succinct wisdom.Written for women but strong enough for a man. Suspend your doubts and read it!"
4,Hershey's 1934 Cookbook Review,"From the steppes of Siberia to the plains of the Serengeti, rare indeed is the person, young or old, who has not heard of Hershey's chocolate! It could be the best known product in the world. The Hershey Company was founded by Milton Hershey in Pennsylvania in the late 1800's, and quickly grew to become an international phenomenon. Here is Hershey's 1934 Cookbook, the distillation of their hard-won expertise in all things chocolate. It covers the entire spectrum of chocolate know how, from the history of chocolate, the preparation of the primary products, and the various forms that chocolate takes to a stunning variety of chocolate recipes. For anyone who likes chocolate, and who doesn't, this is a treasurehouse of a cookbook."
3,Good Recipes,I got this cookbook years ago as a gift. I've probably tried less than half the recipes. The chocolate dessert waffles on page 76 are a favorite with my family. The chocolate coconut squares on page 86 are very good too.The pictures depicting the 1930's are fun to look at. There's an article after the table of contents about life in America during the 30s. There is no index.I think anyone who enjoys cookbooks and cooking would like this book.
5,St. Matthew Passion (Rilling),This is an excellent performance of a moving work. Helmuth Rilling is a well-known performer and conductor of Bach. This 1978 recording is a bargain.
1,Very Poorly Performed,The performance of this oratorio is absolutely horrible. Stay away from this recording.
4,"good cable, does the job",The cable works good. No complaints. I only gave it 4 stars because it's just a cable with nothing special about it...
2,Not for computer transfer,"If you need these (as I did) to transfer files from an old computer to a new one, these are the wrong null modem cables. I sent them back. If you are using them for some other purpose, I expect they would work."
5,Just fine,"I use several of these cables on a serial console server to manage several computers. They have not dissapointed me. Unlike some other cables, -all- pins are present. 115200 baud works fine over these cables."
2,Don't believe description.,"Here's the good news: This cable arrived in good time and in good condition. It works.Here's the bad news: It was NOT the product advertised. It is not a Tripp-Lite brand cable.It is not gold plated/pins. It was a cheap cable that came in a plain plastic baggie. Not even a manufacturer name.I wouldn't care if it were just advertised as null modem cable PERIOD. Then I wouldn't care. It was cheap and works. But It burns me when someone completely lies about what the're selling. Glad it wasn't an automobile I was purchasing. Instead of a 2010 Mercedes, I'd have gotten a 1983 chevette."
1,pass this one by,"I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 1994 and have read everything available on the subject. I have had excellent medical care, tried alternative therapies, meditated, relaxed, prayed with faith, exercised, used vitamins, herbs, etc.etc.etc. I still live with daily pain and fatigue!! I didn't learn anything new from this book. I found its simplistic, repetitive style and subtly condescending tone to be unhelpful at best, and extremely discouraging at worst. I found the ephemeral ""mindbodyspirit"" connection to amount to a fancy way of saying ""it's all in your head"". The last thing fibromyalgics need is unsympathetic MDs telling us we can ""cure ourselves""!!I'd like to see them walk a mile in our shoes. Try the book Fibromyalgia and Chronic Myofascial Pain Syndrome by Dr. Devin Starlanyl for a comprehensive understanding of fibromyalgia by a compassionate physician."
5,"""Must"" reading for all Fibromyalgia sufferers.","Fibromyalgia is the most common cause of generalized musculoskeletal pain in women between the ages of 20 and 55, and affects more than two percent of the United States population. William Salt and Edwin Season are medical doctors who draw upon their many years of practice to outline ""7 Steps for Living a Healthy Life with Widespread Muscular Pain and Fatigue"", and to explain the impact of psychological and spiritual well-being for Fibromyalgia sufferers. Drs. Salt and Season show how to live with this condition, rather than suffer from it. Fibromyalgia and the MindBodySpirt Connection is written for the lay reader, and to help Fibromyalgia patients to better understand the core of their condition and take positive steps to reverse those factors that are within their control. Highly recommended for personal, public, and professional medical reference library collections."
1,Save your Money,"MindBodySpirit can be written all together like it's one word. Now you know what this book is about.If you really want to connect your mind, body, and spirit, try a yoga class. If you want to know how your mind (nervous system and emotions) and body are connected, try some other book. I would recommend The Fibromyalgia Help Book (Fransen & Russell) or Inside Fibromyalgia (Pellegrino)."
1,There are many other better choices out there,"This book, while telling some of the truth about fibromyalgia, was co-written by Edwin Season, who works as an ""independent medical examiner"" for the Ohio State Teacher Retirement System. That means it is his job to find reasons to deny disability to those who need it, thereby saving the retirement system money. (This retirement system is being investigated for misuse of funds.) I am one of their victims, my illness being labeled as ""Somatization Disorder"" despite the mounds of objective medical evidence of brain injury, etc. I provided. Thanks to Season, I now struggle to work just 20 hours per week and I cannot keep up on bills. All because he thinks that illnesses like Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome are all in the mind. He needs to look at the evidence - and, a little compassion wouldn't hurt either. I'm now destroyed financially with little means of support. Thanks for nothing, Season."
4,"Great SUV, 1 Flaw","My daughter absolutely loves this SUV better then the Van also from fisher price.Only problem we had, was the doors were too tough for her to open on the drivers side (I even had to open it for her) and so she got the hang of knowing the door is a bit harder on the drivers side, and it has came off a few times. Luckily it snaps back into place. Also, in the beginning she did get frustrated with the seats/seatbelts - I don't blame her...Overall this toy is fun, we were probably just 1 of a few people who experienced the door problem.There is also a button for your child to push down in the car that'll play music. :)The grocery bag is adorable and so realistic, and the stroller is just right for the twins that go inside.I highly recommend for all daughters. :o)"
3,Nice toy if wasn't so hard to play with,My daughter just got this for Christmas and she loves it. The only problem we have with it is the seat belts and carseats. It is really hard to place the people in the car and strap them in and trying to place the carseats in the back and strap them in is near impossible. If the opening on the top was larger to place your hand in to do the seatbelts it would be better. I would recomend this to others with them knowing it is hard for little ones to place the people in the car.
4,"Fun, but some trouble","I got this for my Sweet Sounds Doll House people, before I knew that their was a new house coming out. For Christmas I got the new house. It was very fun to play with but their was a couple problems. First the dad does not fit very well in the SUV. If the car was a little bit taller he might fit better. Second the babys have a problem staying in their car seats. They should of put an alastic band on it so they stay on it. Third the stroller that comes with it does not fit inside the car, but it works if you out it on the top of the car with the band on top. Overall this is fun to play with."
2,Nice idea! But not practical!,My daughter loves the van but can rarely use it all alone! The doors pop off the babies fall out of their seats the stroller gets stuck on the roof rack (an elastic band) and the seat belts are just annoying! I can't even buckle them all up! Needless to say she still wants to play with it!
3,Not Practical,We gave this to my 4 year old daughter for her birthday and I have the same complaint as the others. The drivers door pops off and snaps into place but won't stay. The seat belts get stuck and the kids don't stay in the car seats. Needless to say my daughter still loves to play with it but is upset about the door. I am going to try to return this one and buy one more to see if we are just having bad luck.
4,Very Surprised,"I was told about this band from my brother who is a nut about underground music. He didnt tell me anything about the band other than that I needed to get a copy of it. After listening to it over at his house a few times,I was hooked.Only after I told him that I friggin loved it was when he let me in on who was in the band. Dustin Diamond!!! Who the hell would have guess that one?Either way... all the more power to them. The Music Rocks...Period."
1,Horrible.,"This is probably some of the worst music I've ever had to endure. This album is precisely the kind of pretentious drivel you'd expect from a washed-up child actor such as Dustin ""Screech"" Diamond. Dustin, we demand that you cease and desist. Get your G.E.D. and find a job, because this is just devastating."
2,Nothing Saharan about it,"I would have bought this in a heartbeat had the African music featured in the movie been prominently featured in this soundtrack. The rock is great stuff, but I can get it elsewhere. The music that anchored the movie to its location (which location the director captured wonderfully without detracting from the plot) was the regional, ethnically based vocals and instrumentals. What a shame I can't get them on CD."
4,Sahara Soundtrack,"If you liked the movie, you'll like this CD. Ot is a good way to brighten up your daily activities. Pop it in when you are washing the car, cleaning the kitchen or just hangin around."
2,What happened to the music from Africa?,For a rock and roll album this has some good tunes but what brought me to look for the album was the great music with an african sound. There is only one cut with this beat. The producers missed a good opportunity to be unique.
3,Soundtrack?,"If you're looking for the wonderful contemporary African music featured in the film as well as the classic American tracks, don't look here. None of these wonderful pieces are included."
1,I found the African Songs!!!,"Please contact me if you'd like the REAL soundtrack, with the African songs, seeing as how the movie was set in Africa. I have the track listings with artists names. I think from there, a 'mix' cd can be made (iTunes), since there doesn't seem to already be one. It's been forever but I found it!"
4,Sahara Soundtrack(s),"I was also a bit disappointed that only one of the African-themed songs made it to the Sahara soundtrack. I also could have come up with some better Souther Rock choices to fill out the soundtrack, but overall it is a great sounding soundtrack.As for the African-themed music, there is hope coming soon in mid-June with the release of ""Sahara; Original Motion Picture Score"" from the Bulletproof label. While the web site lists a May 10, 2005 release date, the label e-mailed me with a mid June 2005 release date."
1,Brain dead song selection,"I'm not giving one star to the songs some of which are perenial rock classics, but a single star for the people who picked these songs for the soundtrack. Four of these tunes are so common that they can be found on a billion other greatest hits CDs. While reading the inside notes, they state that 5 songs are ""not contained in the film""!! OBVIOUSLY some kind of money grab recycling some classic rock tunes that you already have and then padding it with some extra songs that are not in the film!The only reason to buy this CD is to get the hard to find Dwight Twilley tune, ""I'm On Fire"", which has all the right elements to be a classic hit, but strangely not in rotation on classic rock stations."
3,"not bad, but missing soul","this is a great soundtrack, but i would have really liked to have seen more of the original score and the african music used in the film on the soundtrack instead of songs that were not even used in the film"
4,An Adventure!,"Matthew McConneghey, Steve Zahn, and Penelope Cruz get mixed up together in looking for a lost Civil War treasure ship that seems to have traveled along a forgotten river in Africa."
4,Very Good Music,This album is not quite as good as the first volume but is worth the buy if you can find it cheap. If these songs were not compiled on this series of albums it would be very difficult to find the music anywhere else. This album would make a great gift for any music lover.
5,gorgeous book/ tiny price,"This little book is a breath taking trip through the Adirondack Park. It will help you plan your trip and is a perfect gift for those who live there or want to visit.The photography is stunning, and well worth the price."
5,We love these!,Great fun for a wide range of ages! We have all these sets and love to give them as gifts also.
4,"Good song book, the CD helps a lot","This is a good book of ukulele songs. I would say that many of the songs are intermediate and advanced level. It helps a lot that the book includes a CD of the songs being played. This helps a lot with learning to play the songs. I'm still more of a beginner. I have been able to learn a couple of the songs, but many of them are still out of my reach. I am able to play parts of other songs and feel like I will eventually be able to learn more of them. I still rate the book fairly high because I feel that the limits are my own, not in the book. Just be fair-warned that this is not a beginner-level book."
2,It was okay,I was disappointed with the content. I had seen Pastor Daniel on a Christian TV station and got more information about his experience from watching that than I did from buying this DVD.
1,University of Chicago Spanish English Dictionary,The book is printed in such small print one needs a magnifying glass to see the print. It is worthless and a complete waste of money.Doyle Pruitt
3,book review,"The content was good, however, the print is too small. Looking up words is more difficult due to the small print. If this dictionary is available in a larger size, I would suggest going that route. We purchased this one because it needed to fit in a school book bag."
2,Not that good for English speakers,"This fifth edition is not very useful for English speakers learning Spanish. It does not show the phonetic pronunciation of the Spanish words, although it does of the English words. I have seen the fourth edition and it is much better."
2,Univ. of Chicago Spanish-English Dictionary,"Go with either the fourth edition, or the larger fifth edition. Both are superior to this dictionary. Larger 5th ISBN: 0226666891, 4th ISBN: 0671743481. This fifth edition was definitely a disappointment compared to other editions."
3,An Average Dictionary,"I bought several different English/Spanish dictionaries for use in my English as a Second Language (ESL) classes. This one had been recommended to me by others, but I found it to be very average compared to other competitive publications. It is not an unusable reference, but you can do better."
2,Not as good as Fourth Edition,Small type and strange font makes this new version painful to use. I went back to the much superior 1987 Fourth Edition.
2,THE PRINT IS TOO SMALL,"I THOUGHT I'D SAVE 5 BUCKS BY BUYING THIS OVER A TRADE SIZE DICTIONARY. THE PRINT IS VERY SMALL AND ALMOST BLURRY. IT'S TOO DIFFICULT TO READ UNLESS I AM UNDER A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT. I AM AN AVID READER AND I DON'T HAVE PROBLEMS READING OTHER PAPERBACK BOOKS OF THE SAME SIZE, SO I CONCLUDE THAT THE PROBLEM LIES WITH THE BOOK, NOT WITH MY EYESIGHT. SPEND THE EXTRA FEW DOLLARS AND PURCHASE A LARGER SIZED DICTIONARY."

4,"Good book, slighly superflous tape","The instructions contained in the book, which is available separately, are wonderful suggestions for strengthning the etheric body, projecting its energy, and finally injecting your consciousness into that energy. The cautions are somewhat elaborate, since the author's point of view is that of Ceremonial Magick. Overall, though, the book is very useful. The tape contained in this kit, however, is totally unnecassary. The relaxation can be memorized and elaborated on by the practitioner. Once one is truly outside of their body, having a voice tell them what to do or music playing in the background is an invitation to be pulled back by any transition or variation in the tones. I find the best tool for this sort of work to be a pair of earplugs! Of course, that's just me. If you want to have the security of a voice guiding you, that's legitimate as well. If you think you might feel this way, but the kit. If you're a silent type like me, buy the book by itself."
4,Finally!,"I had been looking on a good book on Astral Projection, till one off my friends lent me her copy of her Astral Projection Kit. I finally succeeded where I always failed before. The book is a very good guideline, but what made it really interesting was the audio-cassette. I would recommend this to anyone who is trying to reach that ""other level"". This will be a classic in my bookshelf!"
3,It was okay.,I liked this book quite a bit. It focused on helping you acheive astral projection which is quite hard to do. It takes you step by step into the astral projection process. It is a good paced book for beginner's and intermediate readers. I would not guarentee that this will definately help achieve astral projection.
1,Never order this item......,The product is fine but Amazon makes it very hard to complain. I paid over $13 for ONE of these. I thought there would be more because the description of this product is plural. I also paid over $9 for 8-1/2 lbs shipping weight. It weighs about 4oz. I am ready to kiss Amazon goodbye!
5,Graphics Have Come A Long Way!,"I love making the people splat into the ground! The graphics in this game, combined with the mutiple camera views, give this game the race of a lifetime!"
1,Great but flawed,"This could be a great game. Unfortunately, its attempt to 'randomize' gameplay makes it amazingly frustrating.Hitting a small rubber cone, for example, either rewards you with nitro or takes you completely out of contention. No rhyme or reason."
1,Never shipped...,"Shipping date said 1/23-1/28, as of writing this the date is 2/21, and I still haven't got anything."
2,Disappointing!,"I was SO looking forward to this title. It looks good but runs very badly even with a 128M card. The controls are really bad. I turned the sensitivity down to zero on the joystick and still can't keep from crashing into everything in sight. Forget about winning a race. I also had to turn the graphics way down to even make it playable. This was such a great title, what the heck happened? And what's with the 5 discs? Watch out, they've flat out taken the fun out of FLATOUT 2.Too Bad...."
4,Tons of fun!,"This is not your average driving game (because who wants to simulate normal driving on your PC if they already drive in real life?) No, this game is all about crashing up your car on the race course or in a destruction derby while striving to come out on top. There is also a stunt mode where the objective is to launch your driver through the windshield to hit targets (with a bone-crunching splatter) for points. Simple but thoroughly entertaining and stress-free gaming."
1,Didn't get full order,I only recieved 3 out of 5 disks that were supposed to come with the game. I don't know how you could even send something out like that. I WILL be requesting a refund!
4,Pretty Good,The movie was fairly accurate compared to James Patterson's book by the same name. It was also a great price. If you are a James Patterson or Christina Applegate fan I would recommend picking this up.
3,Not as good as the book by miles!,Not as good as the book.. but what movie is. That being said it's basically Lifetime movie quality. I was a little disappointed. I LOVE the book and the movie just doesn't do it for me.
3,Okay movie,"Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas is my favorite book, so I really didn't expect much from the movie. It's ok for an afternoon where you have absolutely nothing to do!"
2,Disappointing,"This was so NOT a 5 star movie... it was OK at best, but that's about it. I've heard many people loved the book, but the movie really flopped. My husband called it ""cheesy"" and we both thought the build-up to the ending, although the surprise (won't spoil it here) was certainly sad... seemed to be one of those movie endings that they run out of money and ideas and wrap it all up in 5 minutes. In fact, this would have been a better movie if it were a 30 minute vignette."
2,Unique Racket Specs Eye Guard,"I have had trouble with condensation forming on the eye covering and some distortion with these goggles. From the picture, I thought there was no glass directly over the eye but there is about 80% of the eye that is covered. The other 20% left open is for ventillation, but it does not seem to work well for me as they fog up sometimes. Also the strap will sometimes slide down and press on the ears heavily. If you tighten it up, then the glasses press on the bridge of nose too much."
2,they are not the same as the foto...,I thought that the glasses were as the photo and they were not. I had ones more or like the photo and was expected to buy the same ...
2,Just OK,"I hoped this would cure the moisture problem while playing hard. But the edges bothered my vision - too much in my field of view. Some folks may find these fine, but I switched to glasses/goggles with an air space for better ventilation, and gave away this open pair to a friend."
4,Great guitar,"I enjoy this CD of Flamenco Nuevo music. I like Armik. Maybe not as much as I like Jesse Cook, Ottmar Leibert and Paco de Lucia - but I was glad I added him to my music library."
4,Entry level racquet,"This is a good entry level racqet and better than the ones in the kits. It isn't topmof the line but is a great entry lecel racquet at a good price,"
4,LOE,"THE RACKET IS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION AND IS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR, AND TIMELY DELIVERY WAS FAST, I wish to publicize the RAUETA WEIGHT IS IMPORTANT AS MANY THANKS"
3,"TKO Speed Bag, an honest review!","I didn't find many if any reviews for TKO speed bags so here we go. The product itself looks good, it takes a beating well, is made of durable materials, and the bladder holds the air just fine... now for the reasons it gets a three... one - the triple reinforced leather hanging loop at the top is thick and big... too big for a chain link swivel (you have to scrunch it up to fit), two - I got the 9x6 which is the size of EVERLAST's 10x7, three - it's rebounds are sporadic and unpredictable (seemed to get a little better with use and breaking it in but very little), and it hangs a wee bit lop sided. The product itself isn't bad just needs some more work, I got an EVERLAST 9x6 and it is FANTASTIC... the difference was night and day. Try it at your own risk... I did... lol"
1,Didn't last 2 weeks!!!!,My husband usually hits about 30-45 minutes every other day. This bag did not last 2 weeks. Leather was very thin in some areas and the bag tore apart in several places.
4,Haunting historical novel,"Lincoln's dreams retains the smooth writing of all Connie Willis' books, but adds a haunting, meloncholy tone. Her characters stumble into the netherworld of parapsychology and are not able to get out. She brings the Civil War to life as vividly as ""Across Five Aprils"", but with the added chill of reliving this horror through a woman in modern times."
3,Annie's dreams,"Jeff Johnston works as researcher for a Civil War novelist, and his former roommate, Richard Madison, is now a psychiatrist. The two are reunited at a book signing party, and as Richard consults with the novelist about the prophetic dreams Lincoln is supposed to have experienced, Jeff keeps company with Richard's girlfriend, Annie. The next morning, Annie appears at Jeff's door, asking him for help with the vivid, frightening dreams she's been having about the Civil War. Jeff quickly realizes that all of Annie's dreams have to do with Robert E. Lee, and he takes Annie along on his current research assignment in Fredericksburg, VA. Fredericksburg is burgeoning with Civil War history, and as Annie's dreams become impossibly intense, Jeff struggles to find their cause. What ensues is an odyssey through dream interpretation, history, psychology, and romantic entanglement, and will probably appeal to readers whose interests lie in that direction."
4,"Good, but not Connie's best","A unique premise for this book, but not as well developed as I've come to expect from Connie Willis. It ended abruptly, as if 'chopped off'."
3,For civil war aficcionados,"I picked up this book after reading Connie Willis'""To Say Nothing of the Dog"", I book which I really loved. Although I continue to enjoy her writing, this was a very different book, much sadder and heavier. Also, the topic is not really my thing, since I (not being North American) know very little about the Civil War and am not very interested in the topic. Others who like this period of U.S. history may be able to enjoy the book much more than I did. For me it was just ok."
3,Disappointing,"shelvesread, adventure, surprise, travel[edit]reviewI read two Connie Willis books before I read Lincoln's Dreams. They were ToSay Nothing of the Dog and The Doomsday Book.

Both dealt with time travel.To Say Nothing of the Dog was a fresh book for me and I recommended it toothers. The Doomsday Book, an older book of Willis, was very similar and Idid not like it as much..I did look forward to reading Lincoln's Dreams. Very disappointing. I didnot want to finish it. I kept wondering why this book was published. Itseemed poorly edited. Lots of problems with the storyline.I find that people who love science fiction seem to overlook problems withthe plot or character development. They seem so taken with the genre thatthey are not always especially discriminating.I hope I'm not overgeneralizing."
2,Skip this one -- it's not even really about Lincoln's dreams!,"This generally disappointing book started out with a misleading title and went downhill from there. Since the book isn't about Lincoln's dreams, it's about Robert E. Lee's dreams, I can only surmise that some editor made the author change the name because people would be more likely to buy a book with the name Lincoln in the title. Strike one. Strike two is basing any story on the work of a researcher who spends his/her time in libraries looking up information in the indices of really old reference books. I'm a researcher myself and I find this excruciatingly boring, anyone else reading this stuff for page after page will probably just go catatonic. Strike three was when I couldn't figure out what happened at the end and really didn't care enough to go back and re-read to see what I missed. I never got invested in the characters and so I just closed it up and went on to my next read. You should, too."
1,yikes!,This book had a great premise but it was dull as dishwater and extremely hard to follow. The characters were stiff and ultimately unlikable. I'm glad I borrowed this one.
2,My least favorite Connie Willis book,"After loving the time travel books, this was a disappointment. I never really connected with the characters, and while there was some interesting information about the Civil War and General Lee, I never really figured out the point of the book."
4,A small novel about very weighty things,"This isn't a book to read if you can't read books that explore melancholy, depression, or death in a sensitive yet unflinching way. Sometimes you need a catharsis, and I find that by the end of this beautiful little book, I'm always crying. It explores some tough themes, specifically how people deal with loss, that Willis returns to again and again. In a lot of ways, I think this earlier book says everything she later says in _Passage_, in a leaner, more elegant way."
4,The Civil War and the Twilight Zone,"This book is good. It weaves together the interpretation of dreams, the societal wounds left by conflict, the unwilling betrayal of duty and promises to others, and the past's ability to haunt those who study it. The characters in the book are all good and decent people who feel strong senses of duty to others and to ideals, and they are largely unable to reconcile these duties with their desires to help and care for those around them. The parallels to the polarization of duty during the Civil War are there, as well as the duties which end loves and friendships. Willis' more recent books are a bit better written perhaps, but the great themes of loss and duty to those lost are here as strongly as anywhere in her work."
1,What's happening here?,"I can't believe this book is written by the same author as Doomsday Book (which is one of the best books I have read in a long time). I kept slogging through Lincoln's Dreams, hoping that eventually it would make sense, but it never did enough to make the reading worthwhile. The civil war trivia was interesting, but the main characters had no depth and plot was just plain weird. Go read Doomsday Book or a Harry Turtledove book instead."
2,Dissapointed,"I had just come from ""To Say Nothing of the Dog"" as was vastly dissapointed. Too many bland characters. Too many unexplained motives or actions---what was the deal with Richard? Why did he do what he did? And Annie had no life at all. Very flat. Jeff was good. He redeemed the book. Well, Traveller actually redeemed the book. I caught on to the sentiment and shed a brief tear at the end, but it could have been told much better. I think the concept would have been better portrayed in a poem. I understand though that she needed to give a lot of historical background and explain the importance of Traveller and what he eventually represented, but truthfully? By the end I didn't care at all about Annie. I felt no love there. If maybe Jeff had been married for 20 years...that would have made more sense. Annie just wasn't real."
2,Absolutely depressing an pointless.,I was sorely dissapointed in this book after reading _To Say Nothing of the Dog_ I had to check and make sure it was the same lady who wrote that wonderful book. I found the characters to be fairly well developed but they were just so /stupid/ that I couldn't bring myself to feel anything for them at all. The ending was just depressing. Overall I found it to be written well enough but just not all that interesting.
3,An interesting theory,"I read Ms. Willis' ""Doomsday Book"" and loved it. So I picked up ""Lincoln's Dreams"" hoping for the same experience. However, I was slightly disappointed. I thought it was a good book, but not nearly as well done as ""Doomsday.""Jeff and his employer, Mr. Broun, are working on a book about the Civil War, when Jeff meets Annie. Annie is having these horrible dreams and doesn't know what they are about. Since she thinks they may be about the Civil War, she goes to Mr. Broun and meets Jeff.The book is about Jeff & Annie's experiences in trying to figure out what the dreams are about, while Broun is obsessed with finding out what Lincoln's dreams signify. I thought the book was well written, and it was just the right length--not too long it was boring and not too short that a lot was left unexplained.If you really like Ms. Willis' books, you will probably enjoy this one."
3,"Interesting, but not moving","Lincoln's Dreams is a story about Jeff, researcher for Broun, a American Civil War novelists. The story enfolds with Jeff meeting a young woman, Annie, whom is haunted by dreams of the Civil War. Annie believes she is having someone else's dreams. Jeff attempts to help Annie to get to the bottom of her dreams. In order to help her Jeff believes that he has to get her away from Richard, the psychiatrist that is treating Annie, and help her to have the dreams.I enjoyed the novel from the perspective of exploring dream theories as well as the information it offered on the American Civil War, however as a whole WIllis failed to put the information together to create a novel with plausible characters and plot."
2,Not Bloody Likely,"Perhaps it was because I was going through a ""logic/realism"" period in my life when I read this book, but the idea that the main female character, Annie, was having Robert E. Lee's dreams so that he could get some rest beyond the grave seemed a bit silly.Don't get me wrong, I love most of Connie Willis' writing. I love that her writing style is so recognisable. She throws you into this world with barely an explanation, so it feels like you've entered halfway through a story, until you realize that there's still more than you expected. But the jump from ""Annie's having vivid dreams from the perspective of Robert E. Lee"" to ""She must be having them because he can't rest in the afterlife"" seems a bit stretched. Call me cynical. Maybe I missed something, but it's questionable."
5,A love story,"This is a remarkable novel by a remarkable writer. The theme was extremely interesting (dreams and the Civil War) but essentially this is a love story. Not necessarily physical love but spiritual love between humans as well as animals. The writing flows well and is easy to read and interpret but still many mysteries remain. It made me want to learn more about the great conflict, the battles and its participants. If you like Connie Willis then you definitely should pick this one up."
5,"Fascinating, entertaining and highly recommendable","After I read The Doomsday Book, I looked for other books by Connie Willis, and found Lincoln's Dreams. Although Lincoln's Dreams isn't a very long book, it contains areas of interest for a broad spectrum of people: Civil War history, psychology, mystery, romance, and the price of war both in the past and present. Several years ago, I recommended it to someone I worked for, and when I ran into her recently, the first thing she remembered about me was that I was the person who suggested she read it! It's fascinating. It's entertaining. Read it."
2,"Interesting concept, poor ending","Connie Willis is one of my favorite authors. I adoredTo Say Nothing of the Dogand Passage, so was looking forward to this book. Unfortunately, it fell flat. You can see flashes of the elements that makePassagebrilliant (mixture of science and supernatural, dynamic personal relationships, etc.), but the follow through just isn't there. The ending would have worked if it had been a short story rather than a novel. As it is, however, it feels as though Willis wrote herself into a corner and couldn't quite make it out. It lacked resolution.Even though I consider myself a fan of Connie Willis, I could not in good conscience recommend this book. Definitely check out her other writings, but please leave this one on the shelf."
1,Akbarali Thobhani's books deserve a zero ratint!!!!!!,He has no knowledge of Ismaili religion. To clearly understand this great religion you must have Marifate level of knowledge or higher. This guy is writing is based on spit and all his books are fiction. Buyer be aware!!!!!
1,Tabloid Trash,"Akbarali Thobhani and Akbarali Meherally are the same persone. This person's Knowledge is blinded by his hatred, therefore; the reader will not get accurate information by reading this tabloid trash."
1,MOST OF WHAT IS WRITTEN IS GARBAGE...AND THE INFO IS FALSE,"I certainly do not know where you got your information, but I guarantee that everything you have said is false and fabricated. After reading the book I contacted several prominent citizens and it has come to my attention that you werew disbarred from the community, and have written this book out of spite. What a loser you are, intending to profit from your insecurities. Obviously, your stupid knowledge is overflooded by your own stupidity. Pride is a poor substitute for intelligence, and it sounds as though someone has cut the wires between your brain and your mouth. If you had any brains you would be very dangerous. LOSER.....N.Y. TIMES"
1,"Item received not the one pictured or described, seller did not reply to contact","I ordered two wrist ice packs (one for each wrist). First of all, they are puny and don't wrap around your wrist as the picture leads you to believe. Secondly, though both the picture and description include a velcro strap to hold the ice pack on your wrist, no straps were sent with my ice packs. I emailed the seller thru Amazon a week ago to get this rectified but have not heard anything back. Also the seller has no return policy filed with Amazon either. My advice is buy from a different seller."
4,"No problems, item as pictured","I read the other review about no velcro being in the order, and I must say that mine came with the velcro attached. It was shipped super fast. The only down side is that, as the other review said, the wrist pack does not wrap all the way around the wrist. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars."
4,Good stretch refresher for the inflexible,"I got this video because I missed stretching after working out, and I didn't want to stretch incorrectly. This video is definitely for relaxing the mind and body, so get a yoga video if you want something more challenging.The good:* Instructor gives excellent feedback on good form. I always find myself correcting my position without having to watch the video.* Instructor guides breathing very well* The elastic strap can be used for yogaThe bad:* Several of the stretches are only held for about 10 seconds which is not long enough to be beneficial* The instructor sometimes starts out a position by ambiguously saying 'raise your leg or arm' (I always choose the wrong one!), and then the rest of the position will be described relative to left and right. The mental switch messes up my flow."
5,Gunner Palace Nails It,"If Iraq is on your radar screen, this is a must-see, thoroughly engrossing slice-of-life look at a small unit of young American soldiers enduring the highs and lows of a tour in Iraq. The first excellent effort in what will hopefully prove a water-shed in war reportage."
1,Awful,"As a returning vet I found this movie to have no point or relevance to what was actually going on in Iraq. Plus if your looking for a horrable rap video documentary on nothing, look no further. The only reason this video got one star from me was because it made me put one in."
4,OIF I,Good documentary. Show's what the soldiers face every day. OIF I and II unfortunately didn't have the armor that is in Iraq for the current rotation.
4,Fair portrayal,"I was in Baghdad the time this documentary was filmed - in 2003. I watched it the other night with some of my war buddies. We all enjoyed it. I thought it captured the day-to-day life of young boots-on-the-ground soldiers. It tried not to politicize the war, except perhaps in some subtle negative ways. I feel the best reporting of this war was/is from imbedded reporters - those who decide to live with the soldiers they cover and accompany them on missions. Coversley, the worst is from reporters who hide in Baghdad hotels and read news releases and refuse to live with the troops they alledgedly are covering. We had a Washington Times reporter and photographer (both female) with us for over a month during my tour; they risked their lives in a war zone along with the rest of us (as apparently the documentary maker of this movie did) and thus provided an even-handed look at the G.I.s."
2,potus does flotus,"as a general rule, if you are able to complain, then things are not too bad. these soldiers are emotionally arrested narcissism cases who seem to think that ""I just pulled 2 hours of guard"" is a legitimate gripe. The people in this movie seem to be very comfortable with incessant complaining and conceiving of the soldier as basically a new victim group who should have his or her share of the general liberal whining. No, I'm not in the military, I'm not a congressman or POTUS or FLOTUS but if you are able to stand around in front of a camera complaining about poor you then life isn't all that bad. However the black soldiers seem to have invented a new style of rap: whining victim rap. The combat's so heavy that they've got time to sit around carefully crafting their grievance lyrics. It doesn't seem to occur to them that the Army is not supposed to be some kind of public works project to keep them clothed and fed while they do nothing."
5,Great documentary,"The documentary was a pretty good view on how things are in Iraq. This was my dads unit so it hit home a little more than usual. The rap music could have been dumbed down a little bit, but overall great to add to the collection."
3,Take the good with the bad,"The reviewer ""So much less..."" 7/26/05 took the words right out of my mouth! The Good: War footage you won't see on the news. Personal interviews with soliders (could have been better). Some interesting stories told about a few Iraq citizens who helped the soliders.The Bad: The directors choice of background music doesn't help the movie! It's rap with the P, F and N words used. I expected to hear the soldiers use that language , but the music was annoying. I would rent it, but don't buy."
1,Watched about 30 minutes-wouldn't waste more time.,Was looking forward to this documentary thinking one would get the correct perception of what was really going on in Iraq. What a mistake. Watched about half an hour thinking it would improve. Another mistake. Decided not to waste any more time.
2,Major Disappointment,"This book is sure to disappoint the purchaser--even Parmigianino fans. The book's illustrations are a disappointment. First, it contains few close-up illustrations of Parmigianino's paintings' details. Close up illustrations would shed light on technical aspects of the master's works. The major works are represented, but one would expect a book this large from the Yale University Press to contain more in the way of illustrations. Second, the book skimps on illustrations of paintings by Parmigianino's contemporaries, successors and predecessors. To understand the painter's genius, one must view his paintings in context. Third, the plates themselves are of moderate quality.While Ekserdjian's text provides insights into Parmigianino's work, it fails to convey the importance of his stylistic innovation or his creative genius.Alas, the authoritative Parmigianino text has yet to be written."
2,Disappointing,"This book rounded out a spate of very poor internet purchases; I had only ever seen the Madonna with the Long Neck prior to this book, and quite looked forward to seeing more of Parmigianino's work. Part of the problem is with the work itself, which I thought was decidedly mediocre, with some unbelievably poor portraits of such off-hand execution as to make one wonder how any patron would have paid for them. However, the images are also slightly off-focus, and the book overall has a dark, depressing visual feel to it. Don't buy it unless you have actually flipped through a copy (and love Parmigianino - I certainly don't think he deserves the ""one of the greatest genius's of the Renaissance"" moniker)"
1,disappointing mug,"Nice, tall mug, but square in shape (even though product description does not specify so)."
2,Good Film/Terrible DVD,"The BCI/Eclipse release of Karate Warriors is available at your local Family Dollar Store (for $1.00 +tax). But buyer beware! The video and audio transfer on this release is very, very poor: a fuzzy picture and a nearly inaudible soundtrack.The (all-too familiar) plot traces the mercenary Chiba pitting two rival gangs against one another. In the process he befriends a young boy whose father is an apt Samurai. Chiba's and the Samurai's paths eventually collide.Admittedly, there is some fine karate entertainment here. Also, Sonny shows a very believably gentle side to his character in his relation to the young boy. In fact, next to the first two Streetfighter episodes, this is probably my (third) favorite Sonny Chiba film.Too bad the DVD transfer is so pitiful--bordering on the intolerable, otherwise I would easily have given the film 4 stars."
2,BORING KUNG-FU FLICK SAVED BY A DECENT SECOND HALF,"A KUNG-FU FIGHTER [SONNY CHIBA] BECOMES CAUGHT UP IN A GANG BETWEEN TWO GANGS. THE FIGHT SCENES ARE MOSTLY BORING UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF THE FILM AND THE STORY IS EXTREMELY WEAK. BUT HOPEFULLY, THINGS TEND TO GET A LITTLE BETTER IN THE SECOND HALF. AT LEAST THE MOVIE DOES END ON A GOOD NOTE. THIS IS NOT ONE OF SONNY CHIBA'S BEST MOVIES, BUT IF YOU'RE A DIE-HARD MARTIAL ARTS FAN, YOU'LL PROBABLY LIKE THIS MOVIE."
4,Good book but a little dated,"This book was written in 1988 and updated in 1997. Despite the update, it is still dated in some ways .. particularly as to advice on using the computer in your campaign. I think a more up to date book is Judge Lawrence Grey's ""How to Win a Local Election."" Still, this book is very good in may ways in that it goes over all the aspects of running for local office. It shows how to get organized and how to do the importnant things for a local race, such as door to door campaigning. All in all, this book is helpful to the candidate for local office."
3,Fairly Decent,"If I could I would actually give this book 3 1/2 stars, but it doesn't quite rate four. I love cats and love Starbridge novels, so in many ways this should be right up my alley. I did in fact think it was a decent read, and after a few false starts (the Starbridge novel before this one really disappointed me, so I was slow getting into this one) it managed to hold my attention well. I appreciated the various issues brought up because of the romantic interest between the two lead characters. I have no idea what would happen in real life if two alien species became attracted to each other, but in some ways at least this seemed to do a decent job of considering that. Some of the story did seem a bit too... predictable, maybe? However, the end still held some surprises, which I appreciated. This isn't the best book I've ever read, but (particularly for Starbridge fans) it's not bad."
3,Good idea but it just doesn't live up to expectation,"The plot behind this book looked so good when I bought this book. Unfortunately the actual execution of the plot was less than satisfactory. I found the main characters, Magdalena Perez and Khyriz, to be weak one dimensional characters. Perez is the abused as a child heroine and Khyriz is the underestimated younger son of the emperor. Perez has some type of empathic powers which are mentioned in the beginning but pretty much ignored throught the rest of the book. Khyriz is ""surprisingly"" the only one of the royals who was able to recognize the danger to their panet and attempt to do something.Now Crispin and Emerson do have some very good characters in this book, Zhik and An-Lieye, but they are woefully underused. Too many of the conflicts should have been seen by the characters and avoided and so make this story that much more unbelievable."
2,Bad,The dark arts were devil associated. There are witches and sorcerors. They were in a league with the devil. Black magic uses demons. It deals with Issac Newton.
2,pretty mediocre,"I bought this because I love, absolutely love the first 'Sudden Fiction' book. ...Continued is a pretty weak followup in terms of pushing the envelope of the 'short-short story'. Most of the stories in this collection run fairly long and most aren't particularly striking. Perhaps these should have been restrained to 1000-1500 words instead of 2000. Go run and buy the first one, ""Sudden Fiction"", then read ...Continued if you really want to."
2,Not worth it.,"Out of the 60 stories, I only enjoyed 4. It wasn't just that the stories weren't my type, it's also the way some of the stories were written. It just didn't work."
3,"Short Stories, Life-long Lessons","I liked Sudden Fiction Continued because it kept my interest. The stories come in many varities, from death to helping others.There's a lesson to be learned from all of the stories. One of my favorites was Videotape by Don Delillo, about a commercial on tv that shows a man driving down the road and is all of a sudden shot in the head by the Texas Highway Killer, which the author found to be alarming. I thought the author did a good job on keeping me glued to reading on and finishing the story. This book kind of reminds me of Chicken Soup for the Soul, but the stories are a lot shorter. Overall, it was touching, making you think twice about your actions."
2,"Not writen by someone mastering the matter, to amateurs and novices only","As a network designer myself I bought this book out of curiosity and I was strongly disapointed. I've stopped reading it after a few chapters because it is obvious it was writen by someone who is a complete alien to computer-networking. The number of mistakes and wrong assertions turned me down from going further. It is also badly writen, although I am not a native English speaker I found the writing poor and uninspired. If it was accurate we could pass on this detail for it is not the purpose of the book... but definately would not say it is.On the other hand, I am not sure this book is adapted to someone who doesn't have some skills to start with or has troubles with making the difference between computers.Only the amateur could really get something from this book, then you can ask yourself the question: ""how right is that something?""."
2,Aimless Wandering,"""Pundit-itis"" is an occupational hazard for those folks who must develop and speak quotable-quotes on anything from the meaning and construction principles of a ""dirty bomb"" to the likelihood of various nations succeeding in a clandestine nuclear weapons program -- after a while, it must seem like they can ""pundit-ize"" on just about anything. This book has some surprising errors of fact -- for example, using a discussion of ""logic bombs"" in a definition of a worm. It does have the obligatory chapter bashing Microsoft for their poor record in the security area but it just doesn't have a lot else -- I think ""Black Ice"" does a much better job of presenting how bad it really could be out there and ""Beyond Fear"" gives a much superior introduction to the security area for the lay reader. My advice -- spend your $$ somewhere else."
4,"Great book, beautiful patterns","This was one of the first books of crochet patterns I bought and it continues to be a valuable part of my pattern library. I am still a beginning/slightly intermediate crocheter and I have been able to make several of the afghans in this book with no problems. Instructions clear and photographs helpful. I am currently making the ""Simply Beautiful"" shell pattern afghan in Bernat's ""Baby Coordinates"" yarn in pale yellow, and it's coming out gorgeous - it almost looks like lace, but the pattern couldn't be easier. I'm sure this book will supply many more baby gifts in years to come."
3,***CONTAINS CROCHET PATTERNS ONLY***,"Potential buyers should know that this book contains ONLY crochet patterns. There are no knit patterns. The book itself is beautiful, and the blankets are lovely, but this would have been good to know before buying the book - I don't crochet! :-)"
5,OUR BEST BABY AFGANS (Liesure Arts #2853),Great crochet baby blanket book-the only one you'll need!! Beautiful patterns and all different levels of difficulty. A must have!!
4,Please with selection and condition,Very please with the book and condition of the book for the price. Will enjoy trying new patterns from the book.
5,baby afghans,"I now have so many different baby afghans to make. I have serveral babies to make afghans for and they will all be different.Instructions are easy to follow, and the afghans turn out just like the picture."
1,Disappointed,"Waste of time & money. Same old re-hashed crap that any baseball fan already knows. Funny how they mention how Lou Gehrig was never given his due, and then they don't give him the time of day compared to the others featured on the video. What a shame."
1,"Read carefully, sent 16oz, and advertised 32 oz.","I ordered 32oz, you sent me a 16oz bottle. I would like another bottle to make up for the difference please."
2,Disappointing rambling,Doesn't truly catch your attention. I've read 4 other world travel books and am only halfway through this one. Kind of rambles on and isn't writtent o be catchy. Go with Vagabonding by Rolf Potts and/or Rough Guides: First Time Around the World for better writting and inspiration.
4,Emeril Rocks,Excellent book. Easy to follow recipes that make comfort foods a pleasure to prepare; and of course to eat.
5,This is his best cookbook.,I own several Emeril cookbooks and most of them are so complicated they are not reproducible at home. This is not the case with Potluck. I have made several recipes from this book and they turned out great and got rave reviews. The Spinach Enchiladas were declared restaurant quality by my brother-in-law. I also made the Spanish Rice and it was awesome. I have made the homemade ranch potato salad and it was a huge hit. The Ambrosia turned out good...I don't have my book in front of me so I can't remember all the recipes off the top of my head.You will love this cookbook.
2,Marketing at it's finest,"The book itself is not bad, not groundbreaking, but some interesting stuff. However, a large number of the recipies call for Emerils products, ""2tbls of Emerils Asian Essence"", 2tbls Emerils Southwestern Essence"" etc. So he sells you the book and then you have to go out and buy his seasoning mixtures. What a rip."
4,Some really nice recipes,"I liked this book (and I usually find Emeril kind of annoying). Lots of recipes that are great for a crowd. Not too difficult, either; I've already made several of the recipes and LOVED them."
1,Not a cookbook,"This turned out to be a hardcover advertisement for all things Emeril. It was a little off-putting to see all of his products listed in the recipes. Granted, it's in his interest to sell his own products, but this seemed a little over the top. In addition, not all recipes need to be 'kicked up'. Emeril should probably try 'kicking back' and working on the basics. Save your money"
1,Worst effort yet,"While I am a big fan of Emerils, I was not impressed with Lagasse's latest effort. Do we need another tuna casserole recipie? I think not. If you ever questioned whether or not Emeril is a sell-out this book confirms it. Save your money and purchase ""From Emeril's kitchen"", a much better effort that highlights the chef's creativity."
1,Waste of time,Don't bother wasting your time with this one. I wasted 3 hours waiting in line to get a signed copy- that he wouldn't even personalize let alone say hello to me. Then the book is a huge disappointment. There is a better selection in the Better Homes and Gardens cookbooks. I was highly disappointed in both Emeril and his book. He was very rude and I will not be wasting any of my time watching his shows or any more of my money purchasing ANY of his murchandise.
1,Emeril's Potluck:comfort food with attitude.,"I ordered this and another Emeril Cookbook for my daughters Christmas present. When they had not arrived by the 20th, I called Amazon customer service. They said they would send out two more overnight. Well on the 22nd of Dec. both orders arrived here. They were opened by other than me. So now I have to send a set back to you. I'd love to just keep them and save the trouoble, but I really can't afford to do that. If you will e-mail me a return address I will get them in the mail to you.Sincerely,Valerie B. Anderson"
2,Good while it lasted,"It was a good can opener, but eventually the drive teeth all rounded over and became misshaped. At that point it was useless. I paid more than the current $10 for it and I suppose I got decent value out of it. Still, it should have lasted longer."
2,Wish I had bought this at this price...,"I bought this can opener from another source last year and paid a lot more that $10 for it. I did some research prior to writing this review and notice that the price has dropped dramatically at all sources.This can opener works no better than any other regular can opener. It also leaves the clasic rough edge. At $10, it's probably OK, but I paid well over $25 for it and it wasn't worth that price."
4,One man's growth,"Very interesting overview of what Libertarianism has come to mean as a moral journey for an evolving conservative. What's interesting is the author is getting it second hand, with limited contact with current movement leaders and originators. At times the author confuses his own positions with a Libertarian approach.For information on leading world Libertarians or supporters and their work to improve societies with voluntary, or at least more voluntary, solutions see [...] which links to many groups."
5,"Fantastic, clearly written book!","Charles Murray eloquently explains the reasoning and ideals of Libertarians in a straight-forward, no-nonsense fashion. Easily the best book I've read this year."
5,Progressive insights with inflammatory reactions,"Murray's reputation as a trailblazer in socio-economic and political reform is well known and well deserved. But those seeking conflict are less likely to find drama in this insightful look at the Libertarian worldview, than in Murray's controversial ""...Bell Curve."" I encourage the reading of both works in order to glean a clearer image of Murray's political ideology."
1,Sheer juvenile pap,"Sorry, I don't normally write reviews like this. But the collection of glowing reviews on this page drove me to it. You will enjoy Charles Murray if you already agree with everything he says, if you are wealthy and looking for nice self-justifying stories to tell yourself, or if you are not at all bothered by fallacious arguments, tendentious use of evidence -- such little as there be in this book -- and smug self-satisfaction.This book drove me utterly mad while I was reading it. The author knows how to rhetorically abuse feel-good words like ""freedom"", but couldn't argue his way out of a paper bag. For all I know there may be defences of libertarianism that make intelligent use of empirical evidence; there are certainly strong philosophical defenses of libertarianism, like Nozick's _Anarchy, State, Utopia_, but alas, Charles Murray's ditzy book is not one of them. Read it at your peril.I would have given this book 0 if that had been an option..."
2,"Looks good, doesn't work","Dayco belts are ok, and this one ""looked"" good, unfortunately it was about a foot too short for my 5.4 Liter engine that it SAID IT WOULD FIT...so, since I have to go through all the crap of sending it back and getting another belt, it get's a low rating. Be sure and just get the numbers off your existing belt and search for it, don't trust the match up search.2002 Ford F150 SuperCrew Lariet 5.4L"
5,VERY easy to setup and to maintain,Although it is kindof pricey don't let that scare you off. This is a great tank and so easy to keep clean and care for. Highly recommend!
5,Under The Captivating Lontar Spell,"Under the Lontar Palm was a book that really draws you into the story, the characters and the plot. It is a book that is hard to put down once you start. It gives the feeling of Jan Karon's Mitford Series, where as the characters are believable and likable. You are transformed into the jungle with the characters and don't want to come out.Under the Lontar Palm is about the struggle between attaining both affluence and success versus doing the will of God. Before the end you will be engrossed in several scenes of intense, page-turning action as well as the evolution of a sweet romance.At the conclusion, you are left with a feeling that you don't want to leave the characters and wish there was still another chapter.Highly recommended"
2,Talks way too much without making new points,My husband and I were not impressed with the CD. We wanted solutions and all he could do was give example after example that the government is going to receive most if not all of your estate.
3,You can do better...,"This is a tiny book that tends to get lost amid my huge cooking tomes. Not that that matters much; I never use it. Most of the recipes are actually for crepe FILLINGS, not the crepes themselves, and they aren't all that inspiring. There's not even a recipe for buckwheat crepes, which are a staple in authentic French crepe cookery. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is that it's probably okay for a beginning crepe maker."
4,Nice little book,"This book was great for getting started cooking crepes. I'm a simplistic cook, but it gave me lots of ideas for ingrediants for my spread at the first crepe party I held. It was a hit. For the price, it was a great buy."
1,Please don't waste your money.,Love crepes and thought $5.95 was a very reasonable price but it barely worth $1. It is the size of an index card and many of the recipes sound downright disgusting. Very disappointed.
3,"Good recipes, but a very small book","Which is odd... I mean REALLY small, smaller than a 4x6 index card. Bizarre. There are a couple of recipes for crepes and some helpful information, the rest of the book is recipes, most of which sound pretty good. I didn't realize it was a dinky little book when I ordered it. Not really easy to read. I mean, if you needed a crepe recipe book to take with you backpacking where space and weight are issues... but this is going to live in the kitchen with my other cookbooks. So it's kind of unfortunate it's not 5x8 or so... a more or less standard size.Oh, well. Live and learn."
4,Good for the Price,"This small book offers a lot of crepe recipes. I would have wanted some photos for each one, but that would, I spuppose, be asking too much for a $5 book. It is small and lightweight so you can bring it anywhere. Priced well and lots of info!"
5,The Best 50 Crepe Recipes,This book was extremely helpfull in making the crepe maker a lot of fun with new recipes and inovative ways to use crepes. Thank you.
2,disappointed,"I was, at first, surprised at the small size of the book, Then I read through it and decided it was a waste of money for me."
1,Old and tiny,"Book did not meet expectations. Its tiny, almost a flip book and from the 90's. not good. dont buy it."
2,Don't bother,"I am not sure I would buy this book again, there are enough recipes on the Internet for making crepes."
2,Not worth the money,I got this as an add on to my crepe maker. The recipes are pretty basic and there aren't any pictures. It is also a very small book with small type. Not worth $5.99. Maybe $2.99 or less would be acceptable. Seems like they just found a way to pawn off a cheap book with a nicer product. This should have been a free book included with the crepe maker.
3,Okay recipes...,"This book was considerably smaller than I expected it to but and I would have returned it except that it's for my young niece and she isn't likely to mind the tiny booklet. And it IS, in my eyes, a booklet not a book. The recipes are okay though nothing innovative but again, it's for a young girl so she won't really know the difference."
1,As big as a cellphone,book is too small and doesnt have any good info. They should warn you how small it is before you buy it.
3,Not real happy with this book.....,"I bought this as a part of set with the crepe machine and the paddles, the book was a HUGE disappointment and I regret getting it and will not be using it at all. Pass on this it is small and the recipes sucked! I suggest surfing the web it was much betetr then this book."
5,Great,Doesn't sting the eyes and leaves son's hair untangled and soft.He has very good hair but this shampoo is the best for him.
5,Works on cradle cap,Although this shampoo is not specifically made to rid baby of cradle cap it was recommended to me for that reason and I have to say it worked really well. My baby had a small case of cradle cap but still it was cleared up within a couple of weeks with the Mustela Shampoo.
5,Top Notch!,"This book is an absolute must if you are a Penny Birch fan. It is one of her earliest efforts, but also one of her all-time best. The heroine of the story is a strong woman, similar to Amber Oakley in other PB books, who has both dominant and submissive tendencies. There is a little of everything for the reader, but the scenes are rendered so well and so convincingly, that they leave other books in the dust. Early in 2004, a follow-up book, ""Indiscretions of Isabelle"", is to be released, so it would be a good idea to read this one first. This ranks well with Penny's other early efforts, ""A Taste of Amber"", and ""Brat"", both of which introduced two of her best characters, the aforementioned Amber Oakley, and Natasha Linnet. This book has been in publication for a while now, but really stands the test of time. One of the best I've enjoyed in years.B. from Canada"
3,Not for photography through a scope,"This adapter adds fine motion control to your tripod for precise aiming of cameras, spotting scopes or binoculars. It mounts to any tripod with 1/4-20 threads.Unfortunately, it is a bit light weight and can greatly exaggerate vibrations making it difficult to focus at times and unsuitable for photography at high magnification even when mounted to a rock solid tripod. Also, while the unit allows for both gross or fine control of up-down altitude/tilt, it only allows fine control in East-West panning meaning you'll need to mount the adapter on a pan-tilt tripod head in order to aim it in the desired general compass direction.The Orion Precision Slow-Motion Adapter isn't bad, its just limited by its light-weight construction and lack of gross panning capability."
4,Good information,"I am not finished reading this book, but so far I am happy with it's content. It's written with the Stock Options Novice in mind which is great! Detailed explanations and examples are given that make this matter easier to understand. However I did find a few typo's so far so Mr. Simon should probably fire his editor."
1,Options for employees,"This book is a review of employee options. I was hoping for a more comprehensive review that would explain options buying , trading etc.It is adequate for the topic of employee options , but nothing else."
2,Book has the wrong title,"I wanted a book that went through the publically traded options market.Almost everything in the book deals with employee stock options.There is very little information about trading options on the open exchange. The real title of this book is ""Employee Stock Options for Dummies""."
2,Very poorly made,"We bought this for my 16mo old son, he has every toy made I think since I am a first time mom. We bought this thinking it would teach him to build stuff, but the legs don't stay on the table. One always falls off so it leans to the side. The only thing it seems he likes about this table is the button you can press for two of the places to go round and round and play music. If I had to do it over again, I would not purchase this table. The only thing I can say good about this is the storage basket that is connected to the table because that is where the building things stay. I love Fisher Price toys but this one is a dud. Hope this helps."
3,Leg falls off...Fisher Price claims no others complained,I was surprised to see all the others with the leg issue since Fisher Price assured me I was the only one! Well after a complaint filed with the BBB I got a new table today. I realize it was only a $30 purchase...but right is right. Surely they knew it was an issue and I am quite disspointed that Fisher Price's customer service is so poor that you have to get the BBB involved to get results. I will think twice before buying another one of their products.
3,Don't understand the hype,"I purchased this toy for my son when he was 18 months old. He briefly enjoyed pushing the button so it would spin around, but other than that he showed no interest in this toy. We both prefer Mega Blocks and Wood Blocks. The legs on the table, as you can guess, have not been a problem, since the toy rarely gets used. Maybe at 18 months, my son is too old to fully enjoy this toy."
3,You don't have to put the batteries in it.,"I bought this for my son for Xmas. He likes it a lot. But I didn't even put batteries in it till a few weeks ago and now I regret it. The little tunes get annoying and since he likes it so much, he pushes the button all the time. I like how you can store the pieces in the bottom but the legs don't stay on very well."
3,Not that impressed,I like the concept of storing the pieces in this toy and being able to build on top of a small table. I am not certain why the table plays music and has the spinning wheels. My daughter rarely plays with this toy and I would recommend the plain megablocks over this toy.
4,I wish it came with more Pop Onz accessories,"My Son loves this toy, but I wish the table came with a larger selection of pop onz accessories. The amount that you get with the table is not what it seems (from the picture on the box). Overall, I think its a great toy."
4,Busy Pop-Onz,"I purchased this table for my 22 month old grandson, Corey. He loved the table and I loved watching him play with it. One of the legs would not stay on, I returned it and the same thing happened. Maybe I will try purchasing it again and utilize the super glue. It would really be great if in the future this problem could be corrected. It is truly a great toy."
2,Falls Apart!,The legs on this toy will not stay on. They constantly fall off. It is very annoying. I love the concept of building with it. I just wish it was more sturdy. It is very cheaply made.
5,pop onz table is great,I love the pop-onz table maybe even more than my daughter. She likes to push the buttons to make music(over and over again) but the music isn't loud an I love that everything packs back into the table for easy clean-up and travel. Plus the little car and motorcycle are so cute!
4,Great Toy!,"My 21 month old son loves to play with this toy. He recieved it as a Christmas gift. I also had trouble with one of the legs. I came on-line and saw all the complaints about the same trouble. I called Fisher Price Customer Service and they told me to be sure I heard 4 clicks when I pushed the leg in. I'm not sure if the instructions say that or not - I know it says to use a hard surface and listen for the clicks. So, I tried it once again on a hard surface (don't do it on carpet or on a rug) and listed to be sure I heard 4 clicks. Well, that seemed to have worked - the legs have stayed on for 2 weeks now - the longest they've ever been on. I think the best part of this toy is the storage that it has right under it. No more looking for toy parts so my son can play with it."
2,can't stand,my son recieved this for his first birthday and the legs won't stay standing up the one keeps collapsing Needs to be redesigned!!
5,Best Vivaldi Guitar Concertos,"Glad I stumbled upon this. For the longest time I've only known about the D Major concerto, of course with it's well known Largo."
4,A Good Book!,"I personally found this book to be a good documentation of the death of Price Daniel Jr. and the subsequent events that followed. Vickie Daniel,the wife of Price Daniel Jr. was charged with murdering her husband Price Daniel Jr. Ganiel had been a State Representative and had also served as the Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives. He was defeated by Mark White in a race for Attorney General. His father had served as Governor of Texas. Vickie was put on trial for the murder of her husband. She was represented by the Haines firm. This was a spectacular trial that eventually wound up with Vickie's acquittal. She was next taken to court by the Daniels family over her children.She was once again represented by the Haines fir, The Daniels family were represented by J.K. Zeke Zbranek(who now serves as a District Judge in Liberty County). Once again Vickie Daniels emerged victorious. This is a very interesting book that you can really get into. Read it."
5,Tthe Story of the World Book Three,Like all Susan Bauer's book this one is great. It makes history exciting for kids.
3,Hand cream,This product works nicely only draw back is that it leaves you feeling greasy and not wanting to touch anything for approximately 1/2 an hour. Recommend using this at night with apothecary gloves.
3,Nice scent but not very good for extremely dry hands,"I must say I love the scent of this cream. I have to say though, that on the first application, my hands felt greasy, which I didn't like, but after a while, my hands felt dry all over again. It's like having oil and wax on my hands and over all it wasn't that great on my dry hands. On a scale from 1 - 10, I'll give it a 5."
2,"very greasy, slow drying","I read all these reviews and thought this must be a great hand cream... unfortunately its very greasy and takes forever to soak into your skin. I wanted a skin cream that I could put on my hands while I'm at work and after using this stuff I left little visible finger prints all over my desk after I tried working this stuff into my hands for awhile. It smells nice, but I'm very disappointed."
5,"Good, non-greasy","I like this creme as I don't like greasy hand cremes. It is good to apply this, espically in winter to protect your hands. In my opinion, it does not have a strong scent."
3,"It's greasy, thick, and smells bad","I love almond scents. I think I received a rancid tin, because it smells just awful and not like almond at all.If you get a good smelling jar, be sure to use it up QUICK.It's very thick, waxy, and a bit greasy. I could see this useful for some skin issues, but it was too thick for me to enjoy.Ingredients: prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, water, beeswax, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, kaolin, fragrance, citrus grandis (grapefruit) fruit extract, tocopherol, non-fat dry milk, chondrus crispus (carrageenan) extract, glycerin, glycine soja (soybean) oil, stearic acid, glucose, sodium borate, sodium chloride, sodium benzoate, glucose oxidase, lactoperoxidase.Seems like it's filled with good stuff, but as you can see it does contain milk."
4,Yet another great product...,"...from Burt's Bees. Thick and highly emollient, this creme does a great job of moisturizing dry skin. I've used in on my hands, feet, elbows, neck, face, pretty much anywhere that gets dry. The smell is nice and not overpowering at all. My only complaint is that it seems to take a while for the creme to soak into my skin. Other than that, I love it!"
3,Loses its fragrance after a while,"This creme is a great product except that, after a fewmonths, the banana scent evaporates out of the emulsion.It still does its job at moisturizing your skin, but itsmells like plain petroleum jelly (which would workjust as well, I suppose)."
2,Straight-up greasy,"This product smells positively edible, but it leaves your hands as greasy as if you rubbed them with cooking oil. This creme has actually left permanent grease stains on one of my t-shirts, just from touching my hand to it! If you're into Burt's Bees, stick to their other lotions...this one's an oil spill waiting to happen."
5,One of the few creams that does not cause an alergic reaction for me!,"I work in a daycare and am constantly washing my hands, as well as the children's hands several times per day. In the winter my skin soon becomes dry and cracked.Since a young age I have suffered from very sensitive skin. Most lotions cause terrible reactions on my hands including swelling, intense itching, hives, redness with slight pain to the touch, welts and rashes. I tried this product and had no such reaction.As far as the consistency of the product, I did not find it greasy. It is thicker than other hand lotions, but I had no trouble rubbing it in. I actually liked the thicker consistency of the product."
3,just don't let it linger in your cabinet too long.,"I bought some of this a few years ago and liked it because it wasn't greasy. Being an almond scent lover, i was in heaven. Thick and emolient, yes, greasy- no. I got very excited when discovered it, again, in the back of my cabinet about a year later. Unfortunatly, when I opened it a horrible smell escaped. This stuff doesn't have a shelf life, probably due to it's natural ingredients. So, i'd advise to use it up quickly. It's one good thing you don't want to save."
2,Horrible scent,I don't recommend it. The scent is very unpleasant and the paste is too thick for a hand creme..
1,Don't purchase!,"I bought this because the backs of my hands were dry and cracking from the cold weather this winter, but this product is very greasy and does not absorb in the skin very well. After using it a few times, I now get an immediate rash that stings on the backs of my hands after applying this creme. Don't purchase this product! I wish I had read the reviews before I bought it. Waste of $8.00"
1,Severe Allergic Reaction!,"The creme is a bit greasy for me, but I used it on my daughters hands and elbows and she immediately broke out into a severe rash. Her skin was swollen and looked like she had been burned. She rubbed her face and her face swelled up very badly. Her skin was very hot as well. DO NOT USE ON CHILDREN! They should really put this on the label. My daughter was miserable."
5,303 Fabric Guard,"I have used this stuff on tents, motorcycle covers, boots,and the fabric on the interior of my new car. Yes, it does have an odor when applying so do so outdoors when possible. It dissipates quickly enough, tho, and the results are well worth it. This stuff WORKS and works well."
1,a very bad book,"This is a very bad book, it's full of stupid questions and dumb explanations, e.g. the 3rd math multiple question of the 2nd section of the first of two practice exam did not even contain the answer for the question, and the explanation to the question is an error. ."
5,A true Singer,"Here we can see what an incredible artist is capable to do. Mrs. Stade sings the Rusalka's aria as any soprano sang yet. Not even Mrs. Fleming, that seems to be made up by Mr. Solti. Simply unforgettable!!!!!"
5,wow....all i can say is wow,excellent recording......i have been to prague twice and it is my favorite place on earth......the recording made me feel like i was there again.....
4,Rubbermaid Horizontal Storage Shed,"So far I have been pleased with my purchase of my storage shed. I received it in good condition and in a timely matter, with using regular shipping. I have put my snowblower and gas container in this shed, it fits nicely with the top handle of the snowblower lowered to fit. The dimensions given are for the outside so be careful when purchasing and make sure you know what the inside dimensions are, they seem to be about six inches less than the outside dimensions."
1,Doesn't support itself.,"We bought one of these even though the store display seemed to have fallen apart. We thought it just hadn't been assembled properly. We assembled ours in about 15 minutes. It fell apart about as quickly. The back separated from the base causing the doors to come off their hinge pins and it was downhill from there. It goes together easily but comes apart easily as well. Today I saw one at a lodge in Lake Geneva, WI that was being held together with retro-fitted steel hardware.I've seen three. Three had fallen apart. Maybe if you treat them just right they will stay together but it doesn't look like they are suitable for their intended purpose."
2,Okay if you dont have squirrels,"We use this storage shed to keep our garbage cans in. After 5 years I am loking for a new one. The squirrels and other little creatures have eaten away at the ""hinges"" and so the doors fall off if you lift the lid up. The doors are ""held on"" to the body of the piece by a small piece of plastic that goes into a hole about 1 inch deep on the door. There are no side hinges or anything holding the door on the bottom.We dont have a garage so we are forced to keep our garbage outside. If you are looking for something to do the same thing you might want to reconsider looking for something that will hold together better."
4,Jewelry organizer,"Just as promised, very nice product -- although plastic-y. Prompt delivery, would buy from them again."
5,Love IT!,just what I needed - now all my pierced earrings are easy to find - and are always in pairs!
5,very handy jewelry container,I needed something to keep all my earrings in so I could see at a glance what I wanted. This is just perfect. It fits in my drawer perfectly.
5,Brings back old memories,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!!!! I remember listening to Peter and the Wolf as a child and loving it. Now that I have three kids of my own, I thought this would be a great purchase. My 5, 3, and 1 year olds love it. Plus if you are a parent who wants your kids to appreciate music, Peter and the Wolf (Leonard Bernstein's narration is the best), The Carnival Of The Animals, and the introduction to the orchestra will give them a goods start. For $6.97 you cannot beat the price, and it would be an affordable and memorable gift to give friends as they begin to raise their own little ones."
5,No kindermusic nonsense,"Best 4 dollars spent in my entire life. My 4 yr-old son absolutely loves this CD (in the car, he begs to listen to 'Benjamin Britten's drums' again and again -such whining is music to my ears!). Bernstein's narration is charming, though occasionally his explanation of music influences and parallels etc is too academic/intellectualist and not really suitable for young children (esp. in the Saint Saens segment). It is also weird that young musicians aged 18+ yrs are introduced as talented children. But, putting aside Bernstein's hangups, my son loves this CD, especially the Prokopiev and Britten segments (the latter is actually narrated by a child, not Bernstein)."
5,Working Beautifully,"Rachels Polish Remover 16 oz. Pure Acetone (Clear)Clear Pure Acetone is part of the mix for Gasoline Additives, It is the part that helps the gasoline to break down further to Burn Cleaner. It works Beautifully for this purpose. I am retired and on Limited income. I have been purchasing 5 gallons gasoline per month before i bought acetone for my car, Now I'm purchasing only 3 gallons of Gas per month for the same driving distance, i am sure that this acetone also cleans the engine of carbon and obsorbs any moisture that may be in the gas;. Mix 2 ounces per 10 gal gasoline. you do NOT NEED to mix 3 ounces per 10 gal though, I have read it can be done, There does not seem to be any reason. Note, To much acitone would harm your engine meaning, 2 to 3 ounces of pure acitone to 10 Gallons of Gasoline is a perfect and safe mix... Rachels Polish Remover 16oz. Pure Acetone is resonnably Priced... ""Use Pure Acetone (Clear)"", My Car has more get up and go also. Love It... gabrink45"
5,"superb, HIGHLY recommended vendor","This series of CD's has thrilled me and I give thanks to the company from whom I purhcased it. I recommend them highly. They notified me when the order was ready to ship, and they delivered exactly what they promised to do. I will definitely buy from them again."
1,Not for the uninitiated,"I bought this book hoping to learn about matrix analyis. I did not. This book is simply a reference manual with plenty of theorems, axioms etc. with little explanation. They give it to you rough and row. NOT A SINGLE SOLVED EXAMPLE, and not even solutions for the exercises given in the book are provided. If you intend to learn about matrix analysis, as I did, let not the 5 stars review mislead you. Don't make the same mistake, this book is not for you."
2,Came damaged,The book came with a big cut on the cover. Not good at all. Cannot imagine they send out product like this.
3,Matrix Analysis,"What an uninteresting book! The content of the book may be good, but the style is very dry and boring. It's really abstract and I don't think the problems in the book are very interesting. I would recommend this book as a reference rather than a textbook."
3,Good collection of results in the subject,"Definitely, not a lot of attention has been paid to pedagogy by the authors of this book. However it forms an excellent summary of most of the theory and is very good for one who understands it and one who wants a ready reference in the subject."
4,Perfect reading after vacation to Turkey,"Filled in details about migrations in Asia Minor before 19th century that are not as visible as ancient ruins or Ottoman palaces, which I saw as a tourist. Very good on the differences among post Greco - Roman waves of population from Huns to Arsbs and Monguls via Silk Road."
5,Best $20 I've ever spent,"Lessons learned from this book:1. You're going to be ""in transition"" for the rest of your career.2. Get over it.3. Take control.This book shows you how."
3,250GB Divided By 7,"First, the ""bad"": this 250gb hard drive comes partitioned into seven different sections each 31.9 GB in size. There's an 8th partition that's 8.93 GB. Add it up and that's not 250. Plus it's a little annoying to see 8 different drives pop up on your desktop. I would have preferred fewer partitions. This means that if you have over 31.9 GB of related data (say, MP3s or digital photos/videos) it needs to be copied onto 2 or more different partitions/drives. I'm sure there was some reasoning for the 31.9 GB amount but the numerous partitions aren't ideal for keeping track of things.The ""good"": seems solid, well-designed, and worked right out of the box on Windows XP.I have a 120GB SimpleTech drive (with 1 partition) that works good and a 160GB Western Digital Media drive (1 partition) that works equally fine so I'm subtracting 2 stars for the 8 partitions on this 250GB drive."
3,erasures Oh L'amour remixed again?,I am a big fan of erasure and when they decided to remix Oh L'Amour I was wondering why do they want to remix this song again instead of releasing another new song. The remixes were not that good for Oh l'amour. The only good thing on this CD were the 2 new songs.
5,Simply Wonderful!,"I have to agree with chris cotham. The single is absolutely awesome! I love the carsten croyer remix. I give it 5 stars because it is everything i have personally come to expect from erasure. I look forward to their upcomming release in january 2005. for those of you interested in the album go to http://www.erasureinfo.com/ (im not advertising it, im just reccomending the resource)."
5,TRUE INSPIRATION JOSE FELICIANO,A GREAT COLLECTION AND PRESENTATION OF AN ARTIST WHO HAS INSPIRED MANY PEOPLE WITH HIS MUSIC AND ESSENCE
4,Brilliant text suitable for all levels,"This comprehensive text of cardiovascular medicine is useful for both student and doctor alike. It presents clear, succint information about all major elements of cardiovascular medicine - well presented in easy to find sections. It divides the topic along the lines of acute vs chronic and also discusses complaints based on their anatomical location (e.g. diseases of aorta and pericardium). There is also a comprehensive section on procedures and tests. All in all a very useful addition to anyone's library."
4,Good review,"A great overall review of cardiology that is ideal for first year fellows. It provides a good base for understanding the first principles and makes reading the ""big"" texts easier."
2,Boring,"Reading it felt like a slow death. I really did not enjoy it. Far too long winded. It is a ""freebie"", but not to be recommended."
2,Agonizingly Slow Read,"The previous reviews didn't give me the idea of how painfully slow this book was to read. (maybe I didn't pay attention enough to their detail!) The language of the convent added to the atmosphere as did the daily habits of the nuns. Rather than a book that you couldn't put down, this was one I hated to pick up and read. There were, however, some good moments and entertaining characters."
2,White Ladies of Worcester,"I realize it is a 12th century romance and I can handle the words and phrasing of that era.However, it was lacking in content and could not keep interest. I really battled through it several chapters but couldn't continue any longer. If after a few chapters you cannot hold an audience then it is indeed lacking."
3,I just didn't get it... it's still funny though,"Half of these songs make no sense, and the rest are just scatalogical. Some of the songs are just plain hilarious (""Steven the Mouse says 'hi'"".... so plain silly, yet I can't get this melody out of my head)."
2,"For the price, quality lacks","These are priced in between Craftsman and Snap-On. I thought they would be a good compromise. The casting and machine work are very rough on the inside. On some of them, if you put your finger in there it could cut you. The work fine, but if I had to do it over again I'd go with Craftsman...Snap-On if I was feeling rich."
2,Disjointed,Did not particularly care for this book. I found the entire book to be a bit shallow and very disjointed. This was more like a collection of poorly written short stories with no general direction.
2,Very cheap.,This timer is pretty to me but it sucks at a timer. The ringer doesnt even ring all the time so i guess that i will send this back and spend two more dollars on a timer that works better. Other people may have had a better experience but i havent and i can only write and be honest.
1,Deception intended?,"This canister of nuts contained 34 ounces of nuts, not the 40 ounces advertised. After I had already placed the order I noticed that others had complained about the same thing, yet Amazon still hasn't fixed the listing.Also the nuts were not as good as they had been on previous orders. Fully half the nuts were almonds. Now, I like almonds but these were supposed to be mixed nuts."
1,False and misleading,The description is FALSE and MISLEADING. This is NOT 40oz... Compare to Walmart per $0.40 oz price to this at $0.74 per oz.... that is 34 cents per oz MORE than Walmart charges.
3,Tasty mixed nuts,"I have always loved Planters Mixed Nuts but I prefer the ones with the regular salt and not the sea salt. Although I did order the ones with the regular salt, I got the ones with sea salt, which I hate. It would seem ridiculous to ship these back so I guess I'm stuck with them.The shipper needs to implement some quality checks."
2,Useful but too flimsy,"I needed a splatter screen, so I read reviews and this one seemed reasonably priced and recommended. I used it once or twice and it came apart, so while a good idea the product is too flimsy and I can't recommend it."
3,Hell,"This is a condensed version of the book ""Devine Revelation of HELL"" . This is a good witnessing tool. This is for someone who does not like to read or does not have the time to read. I have read the book and listened to the CD and I believe this is a warning of the Last Days."
3,"Good, but just a start","This is a good introduction to what is involved in building a modern ""bike in a box"", or a Harley clone, as marketed by any of a number of companies out there. It gives you some general tips and hints, a review of shop and tool requirements, then walks you through four pretty similar kit bike buildups. All are modern, all are soft tails, and it should give you an idea of what you're getting into. Doesn't mention the wide variety of bikes that can be built out there from catalogs - Old School lovers can look elsewhere. This is all about the new trendy ""choppers"" you see all over the place, which is okay if you're into that."
1,How To Build a Kit Bike,I did not get a lot out of this book. I found it uninformative andand to general in the info provided. Not very impressed with this author. It was not much not much help to me.
4,Kit bike,I built a kit bike a while back. Without this book it would have been a tough go as there is no such thing as an instrution manuel. Just a big box of parts.(500+-).
4,Good info for Harley novice.,"There was some good info in this book. It shows you how to line up the primary, and some basic stuff like that. I wish they would have covered the swingarm a little better. I pressed the bearings in from the wrong direction."
3,How to Build a Kit Bike,Good beginer book! Okay overview of building a kit bike. YOu want build a bike from scratch with this book!
5,"As a butterfly struggles from it's cocoon, Life Begins...","Each page of her book uncovers another layer of this beautiful lady's soul. You cannot help but to be drawn into her precious life and experiences. During your reading of this book, you too will experience a spiritual metamorphosis. Read it. Experience it. Find healing."
3,Five stars for this? Then about 27 for Mozart!,"The preceding review might give some readers the impression that this opera is a neglected masterpiece. It is not. The recording and performance are perfectly good, but it is a work by a good average composer who had plenty of operatic know-how, but maybe about 5% of Mozart's inspiration. Were it not for the existence of the Salzburg grandmaster's magnum opus, I suspect this recording would not exist at all."
2,Review for Degrassi season 10 part 2,This was ok but it didn't have the features I wanted! Was hoping to see deleted scenes or un aired cast interviews! Waste of money!
2,Alright but lacking a lot,"This expansion on the orginal game is alright, much like the first it is filled with bugs. Lucas arts has disapointed me with this, it is annoying to have to restart again and again due to errors. Updates are released and address some of the problems but not all. The game itself expands on the oringal, adding another faction, additional units, new campaigns and maps. The online multiplayer, lacks players, and the age group is mostly confined to young teens, as well a lack of people updating means less people to play against. I found I was just as satisfied with this one as I was with the first game and wish I would have saved the $30 or $40 I spent when it came out, price has dropped but I would wait until its around $15-$20 before spending money on the exapnsion."
2,not quite what i was hoping for,"""Natural-looking"" as stated in the description is perhaps a bit off. This perch is clearly made of plastic and not very natural looking at all with its rather sickly looking brown color intermingled with dots of red and green. If you want something ""natural-looking"" finding a tree top perch that is natural is a better bet."
2,PERCH,I WAS NOT VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE.I GUESS IT WAS MY FAULT.IT WAS NOT AS BIG AS IT DETAILED.BUT MY BIRDS LIKE IT SO I CANT COMPLAIN TOO MUCH.JOHNNY GARCIA
5,great read-only capable jumpdrive,"I bought one of these about a year ago (and four more just recently) for use as a read-only drive to carry virus removal tools. In my business jump drive files are almost always at risk from deletion (mostly from anti-virus tools, rather than viruses, believe it or not.) also viruses like to piggyback on the drive back to my other computers, so a read-only drive is a MUST HAVE. this drive works great and is durable enough for the job. If I had to give it one con, it would have to be that it's rather wide, and won't fit in some of the smaller USB openings."
4,Great for New Teachers,"New teachers may be at a loss when confronted with an undisciplined class and have absolutely no idea what to do. This book was designed to help such teachers. The book includes 100 ideas divided into seven subcategories. The tips deal with everything from stepping into the classroom for the first time to how to deal with discipline. There are quite a few good tips in this book, but if you have been teaching for a while, then there are probably quite a few that you will already know. This book would make a particularly good gift for those who are just starting out as teachers. New teachers could use any help they can get."
3,Certainly NOT the best of the Mickey Mouse Club!!!,"Like several of the other reviews, I was expecting much more from a 2-disk DVD collection. The large title on the front cover is ""Walt Disney Treasures - The Mickey Mouse Club."" Only in small print does it mention that this set is week one of the show. Even after reading that,I figured there would be numerous bonus material from the other years. NOPE!!!!!My fondest memory of the show was the mouseketeers opening dance number and roll call. This was the main reason I bought the collection. But again, they limited the DVDs to only week one where the opening skits and roll calls were nowhere near as good."
5,Perfect!,"Hmmmmmmmm.... What to complain about? What to complain about? Can't find anything except that there are only 5 episode of the original MMC available, and this is it. I mean, it was a daily show and all. Can't really expect them to release nearly 1000 1 hour episodes on DVD. But these five, the first five, episodes are perfect in every way."
3,Why release only one Mickey Mouse Club ?,"When Disney said they were going to release the Mickey Mouse Club by the week, I was excited. Why have they only released one so far, what's the hold up? I'm still waiting for additional episides to be released.Like many other reviewers, I'd like to to see the serials released seperately. Such as ""Spin and Marty"", The ""Annette"" serial, ""Corky and White Shadow"", and of course, the wonderful ""Hardy Boys"" serials.But my favorites are Kevin Corcoran as ""Moochie"" in ""Moochie of the Little League"" and ""Moochie of Pop Warner Football"" who was also in ""Spin and Marty"". When the Disney Channel first came out in the 1980's they showed these great shows so I know they're around, so please release them on DVD."
3,"Good show, disappointing DVD","Although I'm glad the MM Club is finally on DVD, this release could have been so much more. With numerous TV shows being issued in complete seasons, there's no excuse to only release just one week of MM club episodes, except perhaps greed. Even the 5 days a week soap, ""Dark Shadows"", has several 4 disc/$40 sets that each cover months of shows. I believe with black and white episodes, you can squeeze more on a disc than color? A better idea would be to craft multi-disc sets around the serials, with a box set for each serial storyline. I believe there were several Spin & Marty stories, as well as Hardy Boys, Annette, etc. If those come out- I'm buying 'em! Are you listening Disney?"
2,Disappointing - I was Hoping to see the Weekly Broadcast Loop,I was hoping to see the original weekly broadcasts that my friends and I enjoyed re-enacting.
3,Glad it's releasing,"I'm glad to be getting it too, but,Man! You people gotta relax! It's just a TV show."
1,More bones. Less meat!,"I just received the two DVDs. To my surprise, 85% of the video are real people. Where are the real cartoon series? Cartoon seriers only count for 15% of the content and scattered. My kid dislikes it!!! My kid wants the cartoon!!!"
5,"Just buy it whether you need it or not, Must have item!","Oh my, what a treasure to find! I love my bracelets(2) 5 row, they look real, expensive and the plus is they are comfortable. I have a formal/black-tie/hollywood-red carpet type dinner Gala to go to June 18,2010 and these bracelets match my shoes, necklace/earrings which, are also in rhinestone; and of course the gown dress to a tee. I'll look like a million bucks! If you have been looking for a great fashion rhinestone bracelet look no farther, stop and buy I promise you will not regret it! You can also wear the bracelet with just about anything to dress it up even a white blouse and dark blue jeans. This is a Must have item for every women granteed.***Oh BTW:, shipping is fast! I order the bracelets one by acciedent, but I'm keeping the second one, May 28 or some where in that timeline and they came today, June 1, 2010 in the mist of a major holiday; Memorial day."
4,Product Disfatification,"I purchased the Pedrini because of my past success with a Pedrini corkscrew. I have a problem with the new Pedrini, being made in China, not Italy. It works, but not has good, as my older Pedrini, made in Italy. Thanks, Ralph Caputo"
3,"Good product, colors not so good.","The product is good, but the colors are a drag. They state the colors vary, so I ordered two hoping to get at least one boy, one girl color, but instead got two pink pacifiers, when I have a boy. So just be aware that you are at their mercy with the color. Kind of a bummer!!"
1,Very over priced,"You can get 2 pacifiers for the same price from another merchant on Amazon.com. At this price for one, it is far more expensive than what a local pharmacy charges."
5,One of 2 my kid will take,Life saverMy kid has 2 pacifiers that they will take. This is one of them. We have tried others and this one fits the bill.
4,Good beginner's racket,"This is a pretty good racket for a beginner. Not sure if I will ever use the glasses :-), but the rest of the package is a great start."
4,Great value to get back in shape!,"I hadn't played squash in like 2 years, so I needed something that provided the whole package at a great price and with great quality. This was it. It's a great package and it gives you the most bang for your buck. It's not the best raquet ever, but if you're starting or at mid-level, you don't need a 200 dollar raquet... yet."
4,Good Shoe,"I wear a size 8.5 or 9 (depending on the shoe) and I ordered these in a 10. I have a wide foot so they feel a little tight for the first 10 minutes of class, but I think if I had gotten a 10.5 my heel would come out of the back of the shoe. I wear them for fitness classes that have lots of dance moves and they work well. They do slip when the instructor throws in push ups or lunges, things like that where you need good grip on the floor. Very good for making turns, spinning around, and dancing on the ball of your foot. They also give the foot a nice shape when you point your toe. Good arch support. Well made."
1,Really bad Movie,"I'm sorry to say, but this is probably the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. It is just not realistic. it's also very pretentious in trying to portrait the real war-criminals as ""Saviors."" Zero stars..."
1,"Awful, Awful, Awful",Awful movie. It's a principal betrayal of basic facts in Bosnian conflict. Failed attempt.
1,True Lie,"This is far avay from true story.I was in Bosnia all war and Serbs are the one who killed inocent people and so on...I dont even want to go into details,but if you like fiction and lie this is perfect movie!!!"
1,Needs Salvation,"I tried to get into this movie but had to give up on it about half way through. If you do not have any military experience and can tolerate absurd acting, then this film may be tolerable for you."
5,My thought,"After the collapse of the Communism regimes in former Soviet Empire and East Europe, Serbians and Muslims have accomplished what Communism hasn't been able to in 45 years, this almost made Communism looks good!Democracy is political freedom. It should be the ultimate goal of humankind, but it also could lead to disasters. When people have the choice to choose, would they choose the right or would they choose the wrong?"
2,Not widescreen format even though cover says so!,The movie was not in widescreen format even though the cover says so! Why do these mistakes keep happening by these dvd companies?
4,redemption,"I have this film and have watched it several times over the years. It's dark, hard to watch still. And it's a rare, beautiful film about a man who has lost his soul and finds it again. Savior shows a man's journey from darkness and being lost---to light and hope. He finds redemption and has a rebirth. I recommend it. Dennis Quade and all the actors are superb. The casting is spot-on as well, as are the sets and setting."
2,Savior,Did not care for the story line at all. Turns a murderer into a savior. But into todays world it may happen way too often.
4,Where is Nastassja?,"This was a thought provoking, gritty movie that never lagged. Great performances, and great editing, especially the scene where the young mother is trying to decide whether or not to keep her child. BUT...why on earth did they kill off Nastassja Kinski in the first five minutes of the movie? I would rather have seen HER in the role of the mother. We all know she would have done a fantastic job. She is literally wasted in this film."
3,Impartial and Unbalanced:,Not quite an adequate depiction of the war. The part with the little girl throwing the grenade and all seems a bit out of line. The acting and storyline are still compelling.
3,Great product except for the voice,"We own all of the Story of the World books & thought an audiobook would be nice to take along in the car. It is very good, except the voice of the gentleman who reads is a bit slurred & the accents aren't so great. He is a very fluent reader, but reads as if he's had one too many. We also own Book 3 in audio & were hoping this one had a different reader. That said, it's still very convenient to take in the car & the content is the same as the book."
5,Wonderful Book,"Received as described. We are a homeschooling family that uses this book as our spine for history (whole book approach). The children absolutely love this book. History is written as a story, making it very interesting to younger students."
5,Great books,"We've just begun this series of 4 books due to Classical Conversations homeschool curriculum. I have enjoyed teaching history, but my kids haven't quite caught the bug. This series has given them something to look forward to. Every day for homework they read a couple chapters and relate to me how much they like the stories; never a complaint."
2,A Ponderous Hodge Podge,"Although i have not used volume 4, I am finishing up year 3 of Story of the World only because i have been unable to find anything else. I recently stumbled on the history curriculum from abeka and i will switch to them and leave the Story of the World series behind with a huge sigh of relief. No year 4 for me! i have found Story of the World lessons to be tedious, tedious--and did i mention tedious? The hopscotching all over the world from chapter to chapter is very confusing and disjointed. there is too much material to cover in a school year and too little for 2 years. i have felt bogged down with this series since day one and leave it behind only regretting i did not find another option sooner!"
4,Interesting reading.,"Interesting and enlightening. However, difficult to separate facts from faith.Similar to Tiplers' ""Physics of immortality"".Difficult to imagine that a tiny superficial layer of life is a major geologic force on a planet of 8000 miles in diameter."
1,Tape chamber doesn't close.,"We bought this camcorder about five years ago and used it sometimes, mostly indoors. Always handled it with extreme care. Fairly good image (but not sound) if you are not a professional. The most frustrating is to have the cassette chamber refusing to close. Sony repair service would ask me at least US$211.00 for repair. I'm very frustrated in having spent so much money in a device that, I supposed, would bring me no problems during many years. Another friend had the same problem. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,useless,"This may actually be a good camera, but you will NOT be able to download it to your computer. The instruction manual references commands and screens that are not the same as those on the camera itself. Sony tries to create one manual that will cover several cameras rather than create a manual for each one, and the results are disastrous. Nothing about the manual articulates with the functions and commands on the camera. Worst purchase I ever made."
1,Worse Purchase Ever Made,I bought this camcorder three years ago and used it every once in a while. It is now broken for some reason--wasn't mishandled or anything--and will cost over $200 to fix. The cassette won't close. Going to put it in the garbage instead!
5,The camera tells all.,It's amazing. Of all the concert DVDs I've ever bought...this one surpasses them all. Never have I seen such artistry and pure emotional talent be so well captured by a camera. The grace and poetry in the movement and performance of Darren Hayes is one that will hold your attention throughout the show. Daniel Jones remains but a whisper of excellence in the shadows. HE's felt though not always seen. These are two men that prove that the art of a live show isn't dead and that true talent shines brighter then any special effects or flashy dances. If it doesn't captivate you....nothing will.
5,Great Show!,"This cd is lovely. The show is amazing and you feel like you are in the front row.It has tons of extras like a band commentary,a documentary and bonus video clips.Highly recomend it!"
4,For anyone who has never seen them live.........,"I have been a fan of Savage Garden's for ten years and it is so sad that I never really got to see them live. When I got this DVD I was determined to see them live onstage, and to see them backstage, It is quite nice to see them as two down-to-earth guys with an ambivalence to fame and celebrity, and you get to see Darren at his silliest (He's just awesomely cute that way). The concert itself was an amazing experience ""Gunning Down Romance"" was a bit melodramatic for me, and Darren went all Elvis with ""Chained to You"", and the best thing about the concert was at the end after they sang ""Affirmation"" that the audience was deluged with balloons at the concerts end. It was so awesome, I wish I could've been there.I'm gonna miss these guys together, but hopefully one day they'll get back together if only for one song."
5,Must buy!,This is great for anyone who has never saw Savage Garden live! I loved the concert and the little backstage moments are the BEST!! Darren Hayes is quite the funny guy and Daniel is definitely much quieter. It's great though. Definitely a must have for any SG fan.
1,Don't waste your money,"This film is a very poor quality documentary from 1970 on King's life, but the quality is dreadful. The footage used is not that great either. Lots better stuff out there."
4,Important reference for Japanese reilki,"The book is really useful and wrote in detail.If you are a practitioner this book is a must.Some history about Reiki is mentioned in this book too.However, if you are interested about the history of Japanese Reiki , "" Light on the Origins of Reiki"" will be a better choice."
4,London version of Joseph & The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,"Highly enjoyable version, although my personal preference is the Canadian version with Donny Osmond. The narrator in the London version is top notch as are the other cast members - well worth the money for all this listening pleasure"
3,Good But....,I've been spoiled having listened to the version starring Donny Osmond. His voice is so much more powerful and clear. I still give this version 3 stars for the genius of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber but you will find much more enjoyment with the one starring Donny Osmond.
2,Confusing and Difficult to Read,"Warning: This book simply may have not been for me, so take the star rating with a grain of salt.I wanted to like this book, having heard a great many good things about the Macrobiotic diet. And I understand that to understand the dietary and health theories behind Macrobiotics, it's important to understand the philosophical basis. However, the way this book is structured, I found it quite frustrating to read, and I honestly failed to follow many of the connections that it was trying to make between the philosophical systems and eating issues.I'm not giving up on the subject matter completely, but I suspect that this was not the place to begin. Great appendixes, on the other hand, and almost worth it just for them."
5,READ!,"From food and nutrition to lifestyle and spirituality, this book covers EVERY aspect of macrobiotics. This is an important book."
1,"health, happiness, peace... and nothing else?","People should always be careful of self-proclaimed gurus who have universal remedies...I was a macrobiotic myself and gave up because I couldn't stand so many irrational restrictions and religious proclaims.80% of macrobiotics is just vegetarian commom sense and has been around for millenia... but the remaining 20% is a dangerous mix of the Japanese likes and dislikes in food, with more than a pinch of new age mumbo jumbo.Look for a good vegetarian book for food and search in philosophy or religion if you want answers on the meaning of life."
4,More for kids,"This book is well put together. However, as stated, it is made for school children and the vocabulary is not as useful for adults. However, there are few options in Lakhota books."
2,Disappointed,"Is not comprehensive enough to figure out what to do with Access, for example, creating a report from more than one table. Also, the index is not very useful, but maybe because there is not enough thorough content in the book to make a good index. In my opinion, Ms. Balter attempts to put too many topics in one book, but without enough depth to make it useful. It took me 1 minute of searching online to find the answer I needed that hours of poring over through the book left me empty."
3,Transport phenemena prblem solver,This item was sent to my old adderss even thogh I had sent you my new adderss.
1,This book is worthless,"This book has zero usability. It is not an adequate source of reference for any course pertaining to transport phenomena. You would have better luck using the internet to help you get past advanced problems with which you struggle, as this book is poorly organized and has little to offer to the student of any course beyond the introductory level."
5,Wonderful!,"The authors of this book, respected widely as accounting professors and as cheese analysts, brilliantly combine the keener points of e-business accounting and cheese analysis."
5,excellent living history,"Since my youth I have been looking for the Baby Dodds talking and drumming records from the early forties. I had them - a while - on some worn 78 rpms, but the sound was very unsatisfactory, so for years I waited -in vain- for a CD-resissue. Finally it came and I can only very warmly recommend people interested in jazz history and the great names from then to give the young Dodds an open ear. It is simply fascinating. Thanks to the company, that made these pearls available!The Brass Band-bonus is more on the jocular side - but interesting!"
3,Saito 220FS,This is my second FA 220FS and hopefully it won't behave as the first one did. The first engine would not run below 1/4 throttle setting without a remote glow igniter connected. In addition to this problem it would continuously not hold a valve setting. This engine that I just acquired has the same problem as the first and that is you most run it with a glow igniter attached but the valves are retaining their factory setting.I'm not new to Saito FS engines since I run three Saitos' 180s and they run flawlessly but the 220 is a different story. Sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and hope for the best.
4,Second Generation- one of their best!,"Second Generation, a Dragonlance book by Tracy Hickman andMargaret Weis, was super. They brought together short storiesof all of the things that have happened in the Dragonlance sagaand more. You may have heard rumors that Raistlin had a daughter?Well, that rumor is confirmed in this book. Also, you will hear thestory of Kitiara's son, who WILL surprise you. The only reason itgot a rating of a 7 was because it had a few stories that Ihad already read in the previously released Tales series.Overall, it was a great book, and I would recommend it toeveryone who has an interest in the Dragonlance saga."
3,Hmm...,"This collection of stories is probably meant to be an interlude between the first sagas and the Summer Flame. For that purpose it's good enough. Some of the stories are rather stupid (especially the one about Sturm's son), but the Reorx story was actually quite funny and the one about Tanis's son is just as good as you can hope. Raistlin's daughter? Well, maybe that one wasn't meant to be taken seriously. I certainly hope it wasn't."
4,A Good Bridge Into Dragons of Summer Flame,"I enjoyed this book a lot. I strongly disagree with the notion that ""Wanna Bet"" is not a good story. It does not portray dwarves in a silly manner. Rather it Portrays the god Reorx as the selfish god that he is. This book also introduces us to Palin, son of Caramon and Tika, and his test at the tower. It also goes on to explore the stories of many of the other hero's children. Very well done and a perfect selection of stories for any Dragonlance fan who is about to set foot in the book Dragon's of Summer Flame."
2,A waste of money if you own the tales trilogy,This book is ok except for one thing. Three of the five stories are already published in the first through third tales trilogy. Something i didnt realize until after i had bought the novel. Go buy the tales trilogys before you buy this. They're better and have more to offer
3,Check Your Collection,"The stories told here are all worthwhile IF you haven't already read them. Unfortunately, 3 of the 5 stories were already published in the origional Tales anthologies, so make sure that you aren't wasting your money here."
3,Good...unfortunately something is missing,"Ths is a good book overall, but it is definitely short in one area...action. There are very few fight scenes in this book which kind of kills the fantasy part of it. But it is still good, more so because it introduces the new characters to the story so people will understand what is going on in Dragons of Summer Flame. It helps develop the characters for the NOVEL that comes after it so consider it a necessary prelude. While I don't recommend it to the casual reader if you are a fantasy buff you should pick it up if only to learn of the new players in the Chaos War."
4,Surprisingly different,A bunch of short stories based on the Dragonlance characters of Weis/Hickman. Some were surprising and they filled in a good deal of gaps.
4,The Children of the Lance,"This takes place after the War of the Lance and tells a story of the heroe's kids, my favorite being Steel Brightblade, Sturm and Kitiara's son. They told me they are here to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ. I liked it a lot."
5,"after test of the twins, comes the second generation","I was told by a friend that this book was not as good as chronicles or legends.So I didn't buy it or read it.I've found that to have been a mistake, since the book it very good. It binds together events happening in the test of the twins and the dragons of summer flame.It may not involve the old heroes of the lance as much as previous books but brings fort new heroes, and foes.I'd recommend this book to any dragonlance reader."
3,dvd,"I enjoyed seeing Joan Fontaine in this dvd, but, being an early tv show, it lacked the quality of her movies."
5,AWESOME!!!,This book is a must for anyone looking to others to find their own identity. The author lays the ground work for looking to Christ alone and than presents actual examples he has expereinced. This book has helped me to better understand Jesus Christ in me and me in Him. I couldn't put the book down.
2,weaker,"This version-the tenth anniversary edition, which has been newly updated and expanded, is missing much of the original content and has been watered down from the original. I was dissapointed in it, it has been changed and is not as explanatory as the original. Much has been added, but much has been taken out."
3,Demonic Harassment & the Christian / companion book to Bondage Breaker,"The author of this book was originally trained as an aeronautical engineer and who then trained as a Christian pastor. He began his ministry, which has become an international ministry, and also trained and worked as a Christian Counselor who helped people understand the troubles in their lives through the application of understanding of Holy Scripture. As of this writing, his webpage shows that he continues to be actively engaged in helping Christians deal with satanic and demonic harassment through personal presentations around the world.This book is considered a companion book to his other book titled, ""The Bondage Breaker.""Although this text is good, his second book ""The Bondage Breaker"" is more hands on so to speak with prayers, etc. Personally, I enjoyed the second book better."
5,America needs,I wish more books like this would just make the number one NY sellers list. Americans need to read this type of material.
5,I AM!,If you are looking for strength this is the book for you.The power of who we are in Christ is never more clear than in Victory over the Darkness. The book starts off slow but perservere through the first 3 chapters and you will be rewarded. God Bless you Neil!
4,Victory Indeed!,"Neil Anderson's book is so helpful for helping Christians to recognize and find their significance in their identity in Christ. Great treatment of biblical material, applied in a very practical, therapeutic way."
3,Good info but safe for mentally ill/emotionally unstable?,"I read the book until I got to a story with a person with schizophrenia that had no hope of getting better and such. Yes there are lots of solid teaching and examples. Emotionally unstable/mentally ill may find this book to add frustration to their minds. I have been diagnosed with a thought/mood disorder and I found some of the material helpful but some of it to add to my frustration. This book has lead me to believe my illness is emotional or my perception and not chemical. I believe the author has no business of putting such stories without knowing or having current state of the character's/person's mental being. Those who suffer from voices, such as myself can be lead to believe they are really suffering from spiritual battlement when it really is a faulty brain.I personally think this is a good book, all in all. I have trouble, if it's true, that my illness is from a lack of spiritual knowledge or plain knowledge of spiritual truths."
5,Victory Over The Darkness,"This book is one of my all time favorites. I have owned the older version, newer version and have it on my Kindle. The wonderful thing about this book is you can read it over and over through out your Christian walk and get strengthen each and ever time. It is an excellent book that covers many areas. I have typed out the list of verses ""Who I am in Christ"" and ""Since I am in Christ"" and I keep them in my Bible and purse. Even with having them memorized it is uplifting to pull them out and read over them. THIS book is a MUST for ALL believers. If someone reads this book and is not sanctified, they really need to re-read it. Dr. Anderson puts so much into this book. If you gave it a bad review - please ask God to open your heart and re-read it. It is a must for every library."
5,very informative book,Great counseling book - doesn't get any better than when you use Scripture to help. Got this for a friend whose daughter has a low self esteem.
5,Free At Last,"Even though this book has been on the market for a long time, I'm a new reader. How sorry I am that I didn't come across it sooner. Anderson brings the truth to light and shines it right into the reader's life. His writing style is easy to understand. His scholarship is evident. I love that he includes the bible verses in all of his comments--there for anyone to check and consider within context.Personally, the message of this book has set me free. I'm now free to see the truth about what Christ has done for me. My story is nowhere as dramatic as some of Anderson's illustrations, but nonetheless I have broken through the surface of the water and have gulped in a breath of fresh air.For anyone who has ever felt far from God, guilty, broken, condemned, fake, or a failure. You owe it to yourself and your Savior to understand the TRUTH and let it set you free."
5,Amazing Book,Love it Love it Love it. Helped me look at my struggles in a whole different light. Will strength you mind.
2,Victory Over Darkness,I don't consider a book w/ a broken binding/pages falling out to be in very good condition.
2,"A formative novel, but yet a rookie in some sort.","Well, I will not let myself fall into recommending that this book is for everyone in the world. This book is yet reserved for those who trust in Christ and his glory. However amazing it can be, it is flawed and should not be thrusted into nations that practise other religions besides Christianity. Well formative it is, it is not exactly the best to recommend for."
5,Beautiful Lamp,I bought this lamp from Amazon for a gift. It came in great condition. The lamp itself is very high quality and is abosolutely gorgeous. I wish I would have purchased one for myself also.
2,ok but not well thought out,"There is a reason why all others have a loop for the other handle -- when the shears get stuck, you need to force them open, which is a real pain with these shears. I recommend some other brand."
1,Not tuff enuff,"The steel is ok, the blades are not very sharp, but the deal killer is the joint that attaches the two halves. Dislocates when you hit a significent bone."
1,not a good choice,"this package is barely a pound. Even so, you will get charged for shipping a supposed 2.5 pounds. The rawhide sticks are very small and hardly a treat for dogs medium or larger. end of review. maybe Amazon will allow this review? Is it still too negative?"
1,Picture is misleading,The package clearly shows the size as 5mm but that is not mentioned in the product description. My keeshond can go through one of these in three or four minutes. Avoid this product!
1,A waste of time,"This was a light, pool-side read, but even at that, it's not good. Carolyn Blue is a confusing character, not complex, just confusing. She claims to be in her early 40's but her language and behavior makes her seem more a contemporary of Miss Marple. Maybe the author was trying to show a dichotomy between her prissiness and her adventerous side in solving crime? No, I think that's giving the author too much credit. Also, Carolyn is supposed to be a food editor, but she wasn't familiar with some common ingredients.If I wanted to read a history book, I'd choose one. The history lessons about El Paso and Mexico got in the way of the story. Maybe just a way to fill out a book that would have been more of a short story without the historical data?Finally, the solution of the mystery was a letdown."
3,Delicious cozy mystery filled with mouth-watering recipes that I can't wait to try.,"Carolyn Blue is a culinary writer residing in Texas. At an opera production ""after party"" the artistic director eats too much guacamole and hours later he is dead. Carolyn doesn't believe it was food poisoning and does a little investigating herself. She teams up with ex-cop Luz Vallejo and they make a hilarious team trying to solve the case. This delightful novel includes scary Russian and Mexican mobsters, exotic dancers, opera, and enticing recipes.This is book six in the series"
1,do not recommend,"Pedrini Black & Satin Deluxe Lobster /Nutcracker. Very heavy and unmanageable. Shells fly all over the place - hard to keep hand over it in order to contain the shells. Have only used as a nutcracker (purpose in buying it) maybe it's best for lobster. Definitely would not buy it again, certainly not recommend it."
5,Great time saver,"I use many different colors of paint in a day, and having a container for each one saves a lot of time and paint from having to clean out the large cup. I actually own three sets so that I can store each color I use in them."
4,Good Product,"Good Quality and a must for my airbrush tanning job. I did think it was a little expensive, but it did come with the extra tubes and lids for the caps. Overall, I believe its a good value and I will be buying more"
4,Do what they need to,These are good when I'm spraying small quantities. THe cap lets me keep the finish fresh and accessible when I'm working on a project over a period of time.
1,Water Water everywhere,well first i bought a justice league bop bag and it hit a table and popped. then i got this tmnt one at a store. first it blew open and i filled it up anain with water whitch was very messy. then it happened again which more water blew out..... what a bad toy :( cant they make anything good these days
1,Bop bag,"I'm having the same issues/concerns as the other comments. This toy is awful. I've used duct tape to keep the bottom closed so water doesn't spill everywhere. After doing that, it won't hold air to bop!"
1,Don't waste your time,"When we got the toy and read the directions we realized that you have to fill the base of the toy with water to weight it down. We were skeptical but followed the directions and carefully, thoroughly pressed the cap to the water-filled base closed. Within five minutes of normal play the cap popped off and a half gallon of water gushed out onto our family room carpet. It also does not stand up if not filled with water. I wish I could get a refund on on the TIME and effort I wasted on this toy. Don't waste your time or money."
5,Cute sleep cozy,"I ordered this for my daughter when she turned 6 mos old. It looks HUGE when you first see it, but when you put it on the baby, it actually fits. It has lots of extra length, which is very nice, and its adjustable.It made of a slightly heavy material,though (flannel-like) so you should dress them lightly underneath."
4,Pretty good,"Sturdy, quick, easy to handle. Only complaint is that it isn't shard enough for me. If my herbs aren't super crispy I end up having to use a knife also."
1,Pedrini Black & Satin Stainless Steel Herb Mincer,"I bought this for my daughter because she is in to cooking with her home grow fresh Herbs. When trying it out, all it did was make lines in the fresh leaves it did not cut them."
3,Not bad but not what I expected for a GFR clone band,"I have been a fan of GFR and specifically Mark Farners' since 1969 (how can you be a fan of da Funk and not Farner's, right?). Anway, his voice is amazing still to this day but this release is just not where it should be for this time in his career. I have read his bio, ""From Grand Funk to Grace"" and can read between the lines enough to recognize that Mark, Don and Mel need to seriously bury the hatchet and either move on together or stop trying to clone the past with other band members. It was and still is great music but it is starting to get a bit embarassing. Mark's voice is truly a gift from God and although he seems to have moved past the dedicated spiritual side of his life, he would be wise to return."
4,The Heat Goes On...,"If you're like me, you weren't terribly familiar with the previous work of the founding members of ASIA, especially bassist/vocalist John Wetton. One listen to this, Wetton's first post-ASIA solo disc, will show just how important he was to the sound that was ASIA. ""Voice Mail"" (released elsewhere as ""Battle Lines"") could easily have been the next ASIA album after ""Astra."" The songs here are tasty, adult rock-n-roll. No pandering to the teens, thank you very much. Wetton's songs are personal and powerful. Highlights include the heartbreaking Hold Me Now, the ASIA-ish Jane, the hopeful Battle Lines, Sea of Mercy, Sand In My Hand...aw, heck, the whole album is wonderful. If you enjoyed the first ASIA albums, or are just looking for some good, mature album-oriented rock, you can't do much better. You've got ""Mail!"""
4,Decent and Cheap,I just ordered my third one. It is a decent mouse for gaming. The extra buttons are great for internet and Vent. I break them alot because I have a tendency to drop them on the floor. I cant really blame the manufacturer for that although it would be nice if they held up a little better. At the price though you cant really go wrong
1,Only works for 15-60 minutes at a time,"About once per hour, sometimes more often, this mouse will lose its USB connection. The power light goes off and it stops responding. You have to unplug it and then plug it back it. It's ridiculous. I haven't tried with Mac, but I've tried it on several Windows computers with the same result. I know it's cheap, but it's definitely not worth the frustration. Spend a little more money and get a mouse that works."
2,Clunktional=Clunky and Functional,"Pro:-It's $10!-5 Button design is a GODSEND for heavy internet users. The back/forward functions were worth the price of admission.Cons:-Computer would stop recognizing it every 30 minutes or so...I'd have to replug it in to get it back each time.-Big and clunky design...if you're looking for something sleek and ergonomic, go with Logitech.I wouldn't purchase this again."
1,I havent seen worse,"I have been reviewing many book related to XML and SGML and seen many confusing and technical, hard to understand books. But this book is so confusing. Difficult to understand even the very beginning chapters of the book. The layout is not clear and the information they are providing is far away from the spot.I would recommend you to look some other alternatives of this book in the market."
1,Not for Beginners,"I would not recommend this book to a beginner. The author's style and content is extremely convoluted. The book starts out full-speed with very detailed technical specifications of XML and hardly any explanation of the fundamentals of this new and exciting language.Not surprisingly, the reader is lost after studying just a few chapters because the succinct specifications are extremely hard to follow and the examples are not illustrative of the point that the authors are trying to make.In conclusion, the authors completely miss the mark by failing to provide a clear and easy to comprehend format for beginners of XML. Maybe, this book is helpful to those who already have a fair amount of understanding of XML."
2,it's not a good book for me.,"When I bought this book, I really hoped I could learn something quickly. However, after trying to read the first several chapters. I was frustrated and I have to say: I made a wrong decision. Today I bought ""XML Bible"", just after chapter 3, 4 and 5 within 2 hours, I could tell the diffrence between two-star and five-star."
1,Confusing format,"I was hoping to pick up a book that would serve as a complete ""do it yourself"" manual. The format is a jumble of ideas thrown together which makes the book hard to follow. I would not recommend this book to someone who is just starting out to learn XML."
1,Appalling Garbage!,"I am now 39 pages into this book and I haven't learnt one single thing I can actually use. I am a professional web designer, fully conversant with HTML 4.0, and wanted to learn XML. This book is not the place to learn anything. For a start it assumes prior knowledge that only people who don't need a book about XML in the first place would have. Secondly, it contains references to URLs that are broken or heavily out of date. Thirdly it confuses apostrophes with exclamation marks (I kid ye not!). Fourthly it contains obvious syntactic errors such as missing delimiters (>). I decided to soldier through the book as far as I could but when I got to the top of page 36 and saw the following line: ""Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) notation is the syntax that defines elements..."" I just burst into laughter. Avoid this book like the plague!"
1,Horrendous,"I'm glad I only borrowed this book from the library. I haven't seen a more inept piece of instructional writing in my life.To see how an educational book should be written, I strongly recommend _XML by Example_, 2nd Edition (ISBN: 0789725045). It's not a breeze but uses some common sense.As for the fellow who is so presumptuous to assume that all 14 negative reviewers just ""breezed through it like a harlequin romance,"", I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. I'll assume either he's a.) mistaking this for another, similarly titled book, or b.) from another planet. Nanoo-nanoo."
1,"Stay away, grave errors!","I discovered some grave errors that teach you wrong things. For example in the chapter about ""Determining the Order of Elements"" the authors describe an example for [49] choice which is against the XML 1.0 spec. I can only warn beginners to stay miles away from that ..., as there are much better books around. Anyway the web isfull of tutorials for beginners ...So if you learned a little bit xml get the Oreilly books about xml:schema and xslt, they are quite good..."
3,Give the authors a break...,"I've been designing web pages and working with RDBMS's for only about four months. XML is a complex subject; if you've perused the specification at all, you know that. The fact is, you DO need to know EBNF to understand the terminology and design good DTDs. I am sick of reviewers who think they can skim through a tech book as if it were a Harlequin Romance.Yes, there are typos, that's the reason for three stars. But I honestly don't know how they could have made the concept of 'element production' (to give just one example) any clearer. There are little balloons with arrows that point to pre-highlighted text and then have a reference to the balloon number that explains it.So now, two knowledgable authors have been trashed. I've lost most of my faith in the Amazon customer review system after visiting this page.Bottom Line: If the reviewer says 'I was confused...' don't necessarily blame the author."
4,Excellant coverage,"It really is a comprehensive guide for Exhibitors and Judges. If you ride in the hunters/equitation read this, you will be doing yourself a favor.Covers conformation, jumping form and faults associated, under saddle classes, how to perform tests 1-19 in equitation correctly,the scoring system, etc. It will help so many riders/trainers/parents with the 'why did we place the way we placed' question."
4,Real close but not quite.......,"My first experience with Barber was Price's recording of ""Knoxville"", and it will always remain, for me, the definitive recording of that work. The version here is certainly good, but it misses the lyrical charm that Price brings to the piece. As far as I know, the Price version is out of print (along with, to my horror, her amazing work on Antony and Cleopatra, Barber's woefully underrated opera), but if you ever get the chance, track it down."
1,Where did this come from?,"Being a long time of Delbert I was eagerly awaiting my next fix of his special blend of country - honky tonk - blues styling. When I popped this in the CD player I was sorely disappointed. Actually opened the machine to check to be sure the CD was really his - the songs were uniformly flat, bland and nearly devoid of the charm and energy I have come to associate with his work.This CD is a non-starter. Save your money for something better in the future."
2,Delbert?,"If this is Delbert these recordings are many many years old. The music isn't terrible, but other than ""Historic Importance"" I can't see playing this very much."
3,Middle of the road,"It was OK, middle of the road kind of stuff. Not the best version of ""I Still Call Australia Home"" I've heard but he's another Aussie legend so he's due some respect. For an all round collection of Aussie folk songs try the Bush Songs from the Australian Outback by the Aussie Bush Band"
4,Raspberry Dawn,"BMSR's second full length album sees the group coming into its sound- vocally. On their first album (Falling Through a Field) most of the vocals were whispered and distant, like they were revealing secrets they only wanted you to know. On Start a People the vocoder really comes into play and the lyrics become even more abstract and the vocals are used more as an instrument- much to our pleasure. With songs like I am the Alphabet and Raspberry Dawn, its clear to see that even though BMSR remains abstract- they have pop sensibilities bubbling beneath the surface. I hope this band keeps doing their thing because nobody else is doing it like them."
3,Interesting but left me unsatisfied,"It's a shame the three characters didn't really spring to life until the final quarter of the book. Before then I just couldn't connect with their emotions and motivations. Maybe because only one of the three characters acts on motive at all (though still very vaguely hinted to the reader), the two others are merely dragged behind. So the characters failed to immerse me for the most part of the book, which leaves the story. Unfortunately there's nothing happening much. Although it's mainly a story about a long journey, there's very little of chase and evade. Which leaves the frequent and detailed depictions of landscapes and cultures. Interesting, but just not enough."
2,"Dry, uneventful","Absolutely not a sci-fi story unless you want to include the science of publishing books. Characters totally lack dimension and are uninteresting in the first 80% of the book. By the time they take on character, you really don't care what happens to them. There are logic gaps big enough to drive an aircraft carrier through and so many of the happenings are unexplained that it renders the book into an outline of what someone wanted to write, and (perhaps) someday, when they figure out a story, they will."
4,Back to the start,"When I find an author that I like, I try to go back to his earliest work and read through his bibliography, to see progress, change, whatever. I think that Greg Bear started strong, with interesting ideas, and still has interesting ideas."
1,MY SCENE IS GETTING OUTTA CONTROL!!!,"MY SCENE USED TO BE OKAY... I EVEN BOUGHT ONE EVEN WHEN I LOVED BRATZ AND I LIKED IT. BUT NOW THEY ARE GETTING TOO COPYCAT. KENZIE'S HAIR IS TOO RED LIKE MEYGAN FROM BRATZ. IT USED TO BE AN ORANGEY-YELLOWEY COLOUR BUT NOW IT IS VERY RED. ALSO THE CLUB BIRTHDAY BOYS LOOK SO MUCH LIKE BRATZ BOYZ, LOOK AT HUDSON, THEIR HEAD SHAPE IS GETTING MORE AND MORE LIKE THE BRATZ BOYZ AND THEIR EYES!!! WHAT COPYCATS!"
1,"SHUT UP - KENZIE COPIED MEYGAN, MY SCENE COPIED BRATZ","THIS IS DA UGLIEST DOLL EVA MADE...EWW, I MEAN..HER HAIR DOESN'T EVEN LOOK REAL...IT LOOKS LIKE RAGS. UGLY DOLL. DON'T F*CKING BUY IT! OR ELSE!!! MUHAHAHAHAHA!"
2,Not So Good,"I don't Like this doll, but I love the scooter and the best thing I can say about her is I like her clotes. She looks fine in the picture, but very bad in person. I will be waiting for the next Kenzie. I love myscene, but to me the Miami Getaway dolls look bad, except for Nolee."
5,You should SHUT UP!,"GEEZ. Just SHUT up already! No one cares (well at least here) what you have to say.. Bratz and My Scene both ROCK!!!!!But i prefer My Scene...Okay...so shut up and go talk about how GREAT and WONDERFUL Bratz are, somewhere else, cuz no one HERE wants to hear it!!!!THIS DOLL IS AWSOME."
2,some good some bad,i love the scooter sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much but the doll is ugly so i didn't buy it
4,no you dont have to shut up,but you do need some crazy pills girlanyway I am a fan of my scene bratz and barbieand see kenzie mite as well be mige becouseshe was made by mattel and so was mige thay both havered hair and green eyes and frikles meygan dont have friclesso kenzie copid mige ok so thirs no need to fight
1,HEY!!,"IM THE CHICK THAT WROTE THE ""SHUT UP - KENZIE COPIED MEYGAN, MY SCENE COPIED BRATZ"" AND YES YOU SHOULD FEAR ME! WHY? YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW WHY! MUHAHA. . . . O YES, I DON'T THINK I FEEL LIKE SHUTING UP. MAKE ME??! OH YES, SORRY, YOU CAN'T - -YOUR TOO WEAK!"
3,Head Trip Scalp massager and circulation is okay,"Every so often my hair gets tangled on the end of the leggs of this head massager, if it wasn't for that reason, I would really like it. But, it is usable. And, I definately recommend it as oppose to the Ting Ting motorized head turner which is horrible."
3,"Nothing Special, certainly not the best anything","Dez Fafara returns with his new ego machine, DevilDriver (DD follows CC, after all). DevilDriver is very much a rip-off of Coal Chamber's Dark Days album, complete with meaningless, redundant, unintelligent lyrics and rehashed guitar riffs. However, DevilDriver somehow pulls off this typical nu-metal a little better than Coal Chamber did. With Coal Chamber, especially on Dark Days, the listener began begging for an end, while DevilDriver seems to bring the listener in a little more, and instead of begging, the listener can tolerate the whole album, even though there's that lagging ""when will this end"" thought. Normally is borderline between 2 and 3 stars, but after seeing the video for ""I Could Care Less"" and seeing that the guitarist still has long hair a la real metal, I'm stationed in the 3 star area."
1,GENERIC,if you like really generic music and think disturbed is good you'll love it. if you're like me and don't much appreciate mallcore stuff you'll hate it. it really doesn't deserve one star.
4,gimme a break,"all hail chris parker, language genius.... are you for real??? thats what everyone needed.. some blowhard spouting off about proper grammar for a devil driver album.... how do you knwo what he was thinking about.. maybe he actually * could* care less...whats funnier is the fact a redneck from havehill is giving grammar lessons to ANYONE... well if anyone cares abot hwats important in a MUSIC rweview.. the music whips butt.. if yer into good old fashioned thrash .. pick this up .. and then see them live.."
5,I'm Impressed,"I used to listen to and actually liked Coal Chamber until I had heard about Dez Fafara leaving to start Devildriver. I was really pissed at the time because I figured they couldnt get better. I was wrong. I didnt get the opportunity to listen to a Devildriver song till I bought the Freddy vs Jason soundtrack and I heard ""Swinging the Dead"". Wow, awesome song. The only regret I have is that I bought the self Titled album AFTER I bought ""Fury of Our Maker's Hand"". It wasnt that I couldnt find their self titled album but who wants to listen to some edited junk? Anyways, I noticed that in the songs ""Devil's Son"" and ""I Dreamed I Died"", Dez Fafara sounds an aweful lot like Wayne Static. And if you dont think so then listen and compare. Very similar. It's not a bad thing, its probably one of the reasons I like those two songs so much. Anyways, its a great album. Very Hardcore and Thrashy. Buy and Enjoy."
4,Way better than I thought it would be.,"I expected this to suck (since Coal Chamber went to complete crap after only one okay album). It however surpised be. Some of the songs are pretty damn heavy (way heavier than any coal chamber album). A couple songs are just cheesy, but most are actually pretty good. I wouldn't say it's a must buy, but if there is anything else you ""must have"" just give this a shot. You may actually like it. Besides it's a HELL of a lot better than the new MTV/Radio friendly Slipknot album."
5,"oh my f'n satan, this is awesome....","after listening to this CD, DevilDriver is now one of my Top 5 favorite bands (right up there with Fear Factory, Lamb of God, and American Head Charge, to get a sense of my tastes). previous reviewer made a reference to Coal Chamber, which i have to disagree a bit. you can hear the foundation of CC, but then the roof is blown off and the amps are cranked to 11 (anyone get the Spinal Tap reference?) with a power, heart, soul, and ferocity that Chamber was lacking.buy this CD now. go, run, shove old ladies out of the way to get it, ......why are you still reading, go, now, you are missing out. it is that damn good."
4,Devildriver is your god,"I think like 99% of devildriver reviewers, i was never a fan of coal chamber, but devildriver puts dez's old band to shame. Dez has a great new sound in his voice ( alot more angry ) and great bandmates. I only gave the cd a 4 because the lyrics are kind of dumb in some songs and some of the tracks have repetative choruses that dont stand out from others. The first half of the cd along with # 9 are wonderful. Other than that the rest of the tracks are mediocre or just plain lame. If you havent checked into their new album, I highly suggest you do because they have matured so much from this one. A great debut from Devildriver to say the least."
4,Nice cd....,"I took a chance on this cd based on ""I could care less""..and I have to say I wasn't disappointed. If your looking for some hard metal with some speed, look no further. ""die"" and ""cry for me sky"" are two of the best metal songs i've heard in the past year. Only reason it didn't get 5 stars was that most of the songs have the same structure;speed. Could've used a couple slower heavier tracks to break the monotony. Worth the $$$ though."
2,There are highs and lows to this one,"First off, let me say that I was never a big Coal Chamber fan, so I did not feel some sort of loyalty to Dez when I picked this album up. I heard ""I Could Care Less"" on HB's Ball and liked it, so I figured, what the heck. This album suffers from an extreme lack of variety. There are some awesome metal tracks on this album, but too many of the songs sound similar to each other. My advice: if you've heard ""I Could Care Less"" and like it, do yourself a favor and listen to the rest of the album first before you get it."
3,It's different,"Yeah coal chamber sucks, but don't let that keep you from at least listening to this one. It's definetly metal, not the most intesne or anything. It's sort of like new-metal on speed. If you like Hatebreed type stuff this is the CD for you. The only thing that held this back as far as being a no-doubt-about-it metal album is the lack of technical guitar work. There are two guitarist yet no leads or harmonies. The drummer's stuff is straight-up mosh-pit-metal though. The one strength in this CD is definetly the double-bass. It's no deicide but it's got it's own type of intensity that really works. So, in summation, this isn't the most metal album there is but it's not new-metal either. Forget about that atrocity known as Coal Chamber, Devildriver is completly different."
5,Fast 'n' Easy,"These,like all MOM afghans, work up quickly and have a minimum of fussy sewing since they only require stitching together long panels instead of individual squares. This makes them ideal for quick gifts. The only drawback with these for me is that once a panel gets long enough for the end to lay on the floor it automatically becomes a temporary cat bed- it does keep your feet warm though!"
4,tight Collection,"Who said a Funk Band can't Rock? you name it and Funkadelic brought the Pain Musically. now while overall the Isley brothers&Earth,Wind&Fire moved me more, nobody could outplay these cats. in terms of playing on there respective Instruments these Cats were Beasts. George Clinton was the Genius Mind who crafted&set the tone of the Band.Eddie Hazel trademark Licks on Guitar are timeless.Bernie Worrell, Bootsy,Gary shider,&the whole gang who brought so many tight jams to life.""Maggot Brain"",standing on the verge of getting it on,etc... are tight. Funkadelic made Albums that made you think. they are One of the Greatest Rock&Roll Bands Ever Period. you name the style&these Brothers could play it&Bring the Instrumentation pain."
4,Great Collection minus 1,"Every cut on this collection is worth collecting. I would had like to see ""Let's Take It To the Stage"" on here, but other than that, it's worth the money. I recommend buying this with ""Under a Grove [Box Set]"" for non stop Funkadelic. Check out my review for ""Under a Grove [Box Set]""."
3,I want some new funkaDELIC MATERIAL,"okay if I was 13 just discovereing the funk yeah I would get this but since these are songs that I grew up listening to and these are selections from funkadelic's 8 lp's from westbound I would skip this and pray for some new new funkadelic cd's but for newbies this is a good start to see what this group is all about funkadelic was the greatest rock band ever and too bad they do'nt get enough props. eddie hazel is a guitar god that could rival hendrix and was his only competition and you'll witness in songs like free your mind and your ass will follow, red hot mama, and I wanna know if it's good to you and feutures maggot brain which was eddie's greatest solo ever and plus built the funkadelic foundation.props to all the members bernie worrell, tiki, billy bass, gary shider, bootsy collins, fuzzy, shady grady, calvin simon, and the good doctor himself george clinton for being the completer minister of all things heathen."
4,Original Broadway Cats CD,"My daughter is a big fan of Cats. She owns the video of the musical, has seen it live, and sings the music often. The CD came very fast, packed very well and was in very good shape when it arrived. The only thing that was a tiny dissapointment was the fact this is a very old version and not as snazzy as the newer version. That is something I had not considered. I should have asked another musical lover to advise me on which recording would be most like the video she owns. Love the musical and the music anyway."
5,Great CD,"I have always loved the show ""Cats"" even though I never saw it on the live stage. This CD is high quality with the original Broadway cast. It's the next best thing to being there."
2,MEOW,"ASndrew Lloyd Webber's CATS stage production is amazing. However, this CD recording is simply blah. Where is the magic?!?! This CD lacks a certain someting. This only deserves 2 out of 5. Its a giant hair ball."
3,*shrug*,"I'm not terribly excited about CATS, but I do enjoy it. I think I would rather watch the DVD or the show than listen to the soundtrack. The opening song is a favorite of mine. This soundtrack is mostly only good if you've seen the show and want to relive the memories."
5,Pure Musical Rapture,"Take it from a seasoned fan of this genre of music that this is better than most anything out there. I have most of the Global Underground, Renaissance, Ministry of Sound, and other miscellaneous recordings, but this is different. Better. I have never heard any of these songs on another compilation. John Selway obviously knows what works in a mix, and believe me, the flow is smooth enough to keep me mellow in Los Angeles traffic. The next time I attempt to turn someone onto this type of music, this is the CD that I will suggest."
2,Do not buy,"This is a terrible product. If you want to mangle every tomatoe you cut, then go ahead and buy this. I was very disappointed with it's performance."
2,Pretty boring but educational.,"I haven't finished the book but I'm still reading. Blocks of history are patched into the narrative. The narrative actually doesn't seem to tell you what really happened. The writer omits what he actually saw in my opinion. Or, maybe nothing interesting happened. So, it has been a bummer so far. Tons of detail on the hill tribes. Only their names are different and can not be pronounced in Idaho. When I read, I don't feel like I'm in Burma. I haven't stepped on one snake nor have I been snarled at by a crocodile. I think it was in Burma where 1000 Japanese soldiers were eaten by crocs.JohnJohn T. Jones, Ph.D."
4,"Detailed, nuanced, yet rewarding","Collins provides a much needed/clarifying work on Wesley's soteriology. His ultimate goal is to help the reader see a distinctive Wesleyan via salutis (way of salvation). Wesley's intentions have been categorized more so as mysterious than distinctive. He has been used in many vains, Catholic, Calvin, Pietist, and even Eastern Orthodox. Collins makes a great case for Wesley's soteriology being unique in itself and rightfully so. This work is not a quick read. The reader must be engaged and ready to do some serious intellectual wrestling, maybe even wrestle with ones own soteriological understandings."
2,Useful book but sloppily edited,"I found this book to be a useful foundation in learning about self-defense law. However, this title could have definitely benefited from basic editing and proofreading. The entire text was fraught with grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and typos.For these errors to be present in a printed instructional work is ridiculous and detracted from an otherwise fine work."
2,Poor Remakes Of Their Hits,"Buyer beware!! Despite several online descriptions of this product that says these are the original versions, half of them are not. The hits from their Warner Brothers heyday (""Hard As A Rock"", ""Smooth Up In Ya"", etc., are inferior re-recordings done by the band. Stay away from this rip-off."
1,Bad Quality and its NOT all there hit's,"As mentioned in other reviews, the quality of sound is pretty bad and the DVD is amateur recorded.Then, there is tracks that are missing.""Rock Candy"", ""Hell On My Wheels"" & ""Crank Me Up"".... where are those hit songs?Call this a greatest hits?"
2,New recordings of old songs,"These are new recordings. Listen and compare them to the originals. ""Smooth Up In Ya"" is 4:26 on their debut first album but is 5:05 on this album. Clearly a different recording. Here, the singer cannot quite hit the high notes anymore and the guitar trills are noticeably missing. The drums sound about the same, less cymbal though. You are getting a Latest & Greatest album here new recordings of old songs. Do not be fooled."
4,Not bad like the other reviews would have you believe...,"I don't get all the hate for this album. Yes, the dvd is just a bootleg copy of a show and it would have been great to get the videos instead but still, it is what it is. The re-makes are great though. The beginning scream of Smooth Up should have been re-done. I don't know who let it go to press like that but the rest of the song is perfect. The sound quality of the songs from the first couple of albums far surpass the quality of the originals. Marq's voice is still as powerful and clear as when the original songs were recorded. He obviously doesn't sing like that anymore and I love the way his voice has evolved but when re-recording the original songs, he sang them like he did originally. Since there isn't an official remastered cd of the original songs, this is definitely a collection worth picking up."
1,does not work.,"This product does not work, at least on african American skin, it did not remove any of the of hair, even when waiting a little longer, to remove the hair. very disappointed."
1,it doesn't work,"it doesn't work well at all, no where near how it claims to work!!!!! the commercial lies it didn't just whip off as showed even when fallowed step by step it's no better then what i can get at Walmart for 3 bucks with Nair!"
3,Future can be futuristic?!,"The book is definitely interesting and worth a read, at least from the standpoint of gaining a '20,000 foot overview' The first half of the book is based on research and insightful analysis.However, if this is not a practitioner's guide and even the trends articulated are a bit dated. Perhaps time for PMI to come out with a second edition of the book?"
4,barbie doll,"I am vary happy with this barbie doll, she is just lovley she would be a good gift for an older girl or a doll collector."
4,Barbie as Juliet from Shakeapears's,The dolls ae almost great. Except for the bending scar on their boxes.
4,Nice Blade,"I got this for my husband for xmas.He is really impressed with the wide, sharp blade on this scraper, and the soft touch handle. I was torn between this one and the kitchen aid because of the handle on the KA. The width of the blade (an extra inch) why I got this one, and I am very happy I did."
2,Like a tube -- no leg room at all,"While this product is warm, I definately recommend the Halo sleep sacks instead. My daughter has always slept in sleep sacks, and I thought we would try this kind. Bad Idea! She had to sleep straight as a board (needless to say she did NOT sleep) -- the point of the sack is to NOT have to swaddle (which she hates) but with this, I might as well have just swaddled her and left her arms free."
3,Remembrancing on my B-Day,"I don't know, it was my birthday and thinking about Love and remembered this movie I saw back in the day. And made a impulse buy for 20 dates on Amazon online on my birthday. In order to re-watch this little known movie about a guy finding love on 20 real or fake dates mock-documentary movie. It took awhile to find the right movie title, i would of name the movie ""21 dates"" cause it would easier to remember then 20 dates (Blackjack). Overall, i felt refresh with my online purchase for the movie, cause their was some value points about Love made within the movie about and finding love. So if, u are of age and it's your birthday and still having found love to be in love, watch this mildly entertaining movie about a schmuck trying to find love without looking so much a jerk."
2,Low expectations = medium entertainment.,"This is a fun movie, reflecting on the trials of dating in the modern age. The focus is Los Angeles but the same holds true in any relatively large metro area. We found ourselves popping in and out of the ""reality"" feel but overall an enjoyable movie. If you have unrealistically high expectations of a low to mid budget psuedo-documentary you'll be disappointed more times than not. Rent it, enjoy it and return it!"
1,20 Yawns,I was expecting this movie to be good considering I'm always open to original ideas. The only problem with this movie was that this Miles Berkowitz dude is extremely unlikable. It was painful watching this unfunny and self centered person moan about why he's single for an hour and a half while he demonstrates little to no consideration for anyone else.
1,Pretentious & Sad,"I caught this movie on cable, and while the premise seemed interesting I found myself disliking the Myles, more and more with each scene. He was/is absolutely the most repugnant, self-centered man I have ever had the displeasure of viewing. He was boring, hideously dressed (wearing a plaid shirt and dorky jeans in L.A??? to supposedly meet the woma of his dreams).What really galled me was the fact that crashed a wedding, lied to a woman stating he was a friend of the groom (she was the grooms sister) and then whining that when she found out he didn't even know the groom, she declined to take his calls...well duh! Myles, no wonder. Perhaps since this movie was done nearly seven years ago, Myles has grown as a person. Please don't wast your time with this trite mess."
3,Pretty Funny,I thought this film was funny at times. It reminded me of another independent video I saw earlier called NOTHING. I can't help but wonder if the filmmaker borrowed some things from that film.
2,20 dates with himself.,"If Myles Berkowitz could just find a women that walked like him, talked like him, looked like him, whined like him... well you get the point. 20 Dates is like a longer version of ""Blind Date"" only not half as funny. Instead we are forced to hear Myles spew on about his notions of Hollywood romance. What would have made a better movie was to try and explain how a women like Elizabeth would ever go out with someone as myopic as Myles, then maybe some men would have actually learned something about women A.K.A. love. I gave it 2 stars because the producer lines while probably scripted made me laugh, and I actually made it to the end of the film. PS, I did foward fast through to the end."
1,Don't waste your time or money on this,"There's nothing worse than having to listen to someone who thinks they're funny (or even worse, cute) and they're not. If you met this guy at a party, you would roll your eyes and move on. This guy is like a dime-store Rich Lewis. Let's put it this way, one of the worse mistakes I made during the 90's was NOT walking out on this movie. When it was over, I felt like I had just wasted two hours of my life. Nuff said?"
1,"I'm Surprised Myles Didn't Call It ""My Movie""","This is like watching someone's bad home movies. Actually, it IS watching someone's bad home movies. Myles Berkowitz is the most irritating character I've seen in ages. The movie is supposed to be a comic documentary about relationships, but keep these two things in mind--it's not funny, and all of the ""real"" scenes seem staged (badly). Particularly irritating here is the use of snippets from (some) classic movies. Myles comes off like one of those quick!grabtheremotecontrol late-night TV motivational speakers. One of the year's worst, no matter what year you see it."
5,Tied for number one of all time in my book.,"Now that's a pretty big tie, and I have yet to see the video, but I will get it upon general public release. I saw it in theatres, payed 8 bucks to see it, and expected low budget porn to be quite honest. A guy filming dates? I wasn't interested. A girl dragged me to it cause she thought it looked charming and it would make me broke. Berkowitz is funny, charming, and original. Best movie I've ever seen people. Totally fabulous."
2,Alright Movie,"Obvious this was a low budget movie. There was nothing high tech or hollywood about it. I have to give Berkowitz credit for having the guts to turn his ideas into a movie. I'm pretty sure this movie was staged, because if a producer is already that mean in the movie, there's no way he would let a movie be sold that might ruin his reputation. The movie was kind of slow. Only toward the ending does it becomes interesting when you don't know whether Berkowitz will end up with his girlfriend or not. It is funny to see Berkowitz makes a fool out of himself on camera. What a person would go through and do to make money!"
1,One of the worst movies ever made,"This movie does not deserve one star, but that is the lowest the rating system goes. If I knew how to tape over it, I would. Because I do not, I plan to throw it out so that no one else will waste time watching it. I do not know what the intent of the maker of the film was, but I think he succeeded only if he wanted to show some of us that the boorish jerks we have dated were not all that bad."
2,Very uneven,"""20 Dates"" had a few very funny moments, and some promising developments, but also very uneven, and lacked the talent it takes to make a good mockumentary. It is a pity that Tia Carrere agreed to appear in the film (rather briefly), because it lends it an appearance of class that it does not deserve."
3,The many faces of Lincoln,"In this presentation we hear of selected Lincoln letters sent through out the years of 1830 to 1865. When I wrote selected, I meant that not all of his letters are included or are subjects arranged. It is interesting to hear Lincoln's letters to various people be it politicians, family or civilians alike, although at times it seemed a bit confusing to understand why he was writing the letter. During the war years it was easier to understand his response to individuals at times, although the audio book does not prep the listener before each letter to explain to whom and why the letter is being written. I think a short narrative before each letter read aloud would have been beneficial at times and really enhanced this presentation. It was great listening to some of Lincoln's letters although a prior explanation as to why or what he was responding to would have really made this book."
4,Sharona,"Yes, I too agree it's a low budget movie, but it is well done. It keeps you interested, it's a who done it...it makes me think of ""the end times""is the rapture of the Christian Church or is a cynical goverment conspiracy. I really liked this movie it is thought provoking. I recommend it."
5,STOP!,MY SCENE RULES...BRATZ HAVE BIG WATERMELON HEADS AND ARE VERY SLUTTY. AT LEAST MY SCENE DOLLS LOOK FULLY CLOTHED!---------------******MY SCENE ALLL THE WAY!*******------------
3,Not the Best Delancy Doll,"I saw a picture of this doll at KBtoys.com, and I really thought this doll was pretty. but when i saw her in person at a store I was very disapoininted. The Miami getaway dolls was one of My Scenes worse. This dolls lips are to big for the reast of her face and just dpes not look right with her make-up. Delancy looked really nice with big lips in Masquerade Madness, but not this time. When this doll goes down in price I am going to by it just for the scooter"
1,Great Doll Bad Motor Bike,I love my Delanecy but the bike is terrible 1.The doll wont be able to ride it unless u hold her and the bike's plastic easly cracks when u run over it with your car this toy should be more durrable
3,it's okay,i saw this toy at target. her hair was messy and clothes areugly. i really like the vespa. but i wish it did not come withthe doll.-mary
5,Great Book,"Have read this twice, as I seem to be surrounded with biblical fools. This book categorizes the difference between foolish choices and foolish lifestyle patterns and defines it nicely. I found the later chapters helpful for boundary setting."
4,Helpful for women who seem to always pick losers,Know anyone who always seems to pick rude or abusive friends?This book provides practical advice for avoiding losers. The author thoughtfully helps readers to look ahead and avoid people who are likely to hurt them.For people who are married to a loser it has ideas about how to handle the situation. Important and practical ideas...
4,well worth reading....,This book is an excellent discussion of the sad truth about many difficult relationships and the people who make them so difficult. The connection to Proverbs and the use of the word 'fool' in the truest and non-colloquial sense sheds light on the most frustrating aspect of such individuals - they are foolish in the extreme and can not or will not revise their behviours to improve their relationships. Still want to live with one? You must read this book....
5,A must read for those in ministry or in a difficult relation,"In a world bent on politcal correctness,we are becoming bent on ""enabling"" bad behavior. This books brings a freeing balance to the difficult person that a person may love & hold dear,and not sure how to help without sinking into the quicksand yourself. An absolute must read if you are in ministry.........very practical,and honest....with hope for the person who has to deal with their difficult person,No matter what the outcome of the choices that difficult person makes for themselves. We have a choice however not to be dragged into their misery. Awesome!"
1,I got stung on this one. Fool proofing Your Life,"As a rule, I have gotten great results, however, Instead of the book ""Fool Proofing Your Life"" I got the study guide which I did not want.So, am I stuck with this book? The place that it came from wrote saying they were going to send me an envelope to return the item. So far, no envelope. Very dissapointing and also am hesitant to order through Amazon again.Faye Kelley"
3,Fool Proofing Your Life,"I'm about half way through this book. So far it has mostly been helpful in validating my own experience and in the multitude of scripture references it makes available for study. I have also, already recommended it to several friends who have similar ""destructive people"" in their lives. It is somewhat repetitive and hasn't touched me deeply but as a first book for trying to understand those people in your life who make you think YOU must be crazy and always leave you hurting, it seems very helpful. For me, it wasn't a first step and I felt a little like a 5th grader reviewing 3rd grade material some (but certinly not all) of the time."
5,A real eye-opener,"This book has literally been a life saver! Jan Silvious explodes some of the myths about ""fools"", such as Jesus calling it a sin to label anyone a fool, the thought that I can control the ""fool"" in my life, and even, ""It's not me!"" I can recommend this book to anyone dealing with frustration with difficult person in their life."
4,Comments on Foolproofing Your Life -,It was actually recommended to me by my daughter - it makes sense - certainly sheds light on some behaviors I have witnessed - it is an okay book - worth reading -
2,"Misleading pictures, very small mask","The mask that ships for this order is inaccurately depicted in these pictures. It is both different in appearance (logos in different places, foam mold looks different), but also very very different in size. The images make this look like it could guard (and extend well past) an entire face. No way. This mask could fit a small child maybe, certainly by no means any teen or adult head. It is a photoshopped image. The fact that you can see ""between"" the model's left eye and the mask (suggesting that the mask is that much larger than the face) is just an absolute lie. This kid would have to have a head the size of a mango."
3,Pleasant listening,"I enjoyed listening to Frank Ifield songs. The song "" I Remember You "" was my favorite and the main reason I ordered the CD. Frank Ifield has a great singing voice!"
5,Frank Ifield,Not really a review but I am looking for Frank Ifields Tale of Two Cities Nashville-London Prodiced inNashville Tenn. around 1962. Thanks whatever you can do.
4,A sameness?,"Not too far into the story, there is a certain sameness to the book like her others. This feeling might change as I read more.Marsha Luzzi"
2,Xena does Japan,"Well, this is an ill conceived book. I have to admit, I read only the first 50 pages or so, then skimmed it to see how it ended. Predictably. I love Ms. Rowland's attention to detail and portrayal of life in 17th century Japan, but I have problems accepting characters acting totally out of the cultural norm of the times. The plot itself is silly and the character Reiko increasingly has become a contemptorary action figure with Nancy Drew overtones. If I really enjoyed Xena, I'd watch reruns on TV."
2,The first disappointment in the series,"This latest in the series is a bummer, with a preposterous plot and some preposterous actions by some of the main characters, including the Shogun and the chamberlain's wife. Hope that the author gets back on track with her next one!"
3,"Wiser, bruised but unbowed","Rowland follows her usual formula in this 8th book of the Sano Ichiro series: good historical settings; brave and honorable sleuthing by the Shogun's chief investigator, Sano Ichiro; plucky initiative and courage by Ichiro's wife; and reprehensible behaviors of all sorts from the in-fighting nobles of the Shogun's top-heavy court. This episode has an interesting villain, and a good cliff-hanger plot, and Ichiro and wife once more emerge wiser, bruised but unbowed by their travails. Rowland has a knack for weaving the strengths and weaknesses of Japanese character into her tales of Tokugawa-era detection."
2,Okay,"for the price I would say they are okay, they charged me a lot for shipping and waited a long time and turns out they were shipped from NY."
3,"Great hero, uptight heroine.","I like the basic premise of the book. I also loved the main character, Dax. But I was never able to actually like the heroine. I found myself thinking that Dax could do better. I'm fine with the reserved, control-freak character that was Amber, but I just feel that she never really developed into someone likeable. I absolutely love the Jill Shalvis books in the Wilder brothers' series, so I have to say I was particularly disappointed when Amber never really developed into a character I could root for. I honestly felt like she was just so negative, so blah...it's as if she never lightened up, never cracked a smile. I can't wait for the last in the Wilder series, but I am very sad to say I was disappointed in Aftershock."
4,This one will pull at your heart strings!!!!!,"Very well written, Aftershock will grab you and take you along with Dax and Amber on their journey. You will laugh with them,feel their heat, joy and their sorrow. Most of all you will root and cheer for them!! It is a great story!!"
4,Works as intended,"I bought this canister 2 years ago and have taken it hiking many times. It's spacious, you can fit a lot of food in this thing - almost too much food. Often times when hiking with only 1 or 2 other people I'll keep other items inside it, too. It's easy to access, I usually use a Nickel to twist the 2 locks on the lid - it fits perfectly and allows you to twist them easily. Because it doesn't have a weatherproofing seal, I typically tip this on its lid to avoid it filling with rain water overnight, thus far I have never had dirt or mud seep inside after doing this.The biggest downside to it is that because of its size, it takes up a lot of pack space. So, if you're looking for a canister intended for a weekend trip, I would recommend a smaller size, this thing is meant for larger hiking groups or extended trips, imo."
4,One of the few approved ones for the Adirondack region,"I looked this up in the local outdoor sports store, and after finding that amazon's price was 20% lower I decided to order online.It can be a bit bulky in the usage, but the build quality is impressive. Durable, and can expect years of service.Provides good protection for food when outdoors, not just from bears."
3,Bigger than it looks,"I'm not sure I agree with this being advertised for backpackers; it's very large and takes up at least 1/3 of the backpack space. Think a small footstool in size. It is certainly durable and well made, but it was too large for me and I went back to a lighter and more compact hanging bag."
5,Better than others,"We went in the adirondacks High peaks region with this canister. We learned that this is the canister that they recommend to use, the ranger told us that bears in the high peaks region have learned to break into other types of canisters, this canister however still is bear proof."
5,Great container,"I recently was making a trip out to California to Climb Mt. Whitney and we were required to have a bear container in this area. So i went down to the local REI to see what they had available in this department. They had a pretty small selection as this isnt as big of an issue in Colorado. And I wasn't very fond of any of the ones they had there anyways. So I did a little searching online and this one was recommended by quite a few people. This turned out to be the best option for me all things considered. My only issue with this is that it is just a hair to big for some smaller packs. I purchased, and recommend getting the carry case for it unless you have a fairly large pack. Otherwise this will take up a lot of room or worse, may not even fit."
4,Sturdy canister,"I used this during a week-long backpacking trip in the High Peaks area of the Adirondacks where canisters are mandatory. It served it's purpose since a bear went after my and my boyfriend's canisters one night but didn't get into them - just some scratches and one was rolled away. But the canister itself is pretty small, I had a hard time packing our food in it. I might just not be skilled at packing bear canisters. It also didn't fit sideways in my 55L pack so I had to stand it up, but it fit alright in my boyfriend's larger 65L pack."
1,Muay Thai,"If you're expecting real fights, this is not it. If you're looking for Muay Thai instructions, this is not it either. This DVD is just several boring clips of simple Muay Thai moves thrown together. For real fights, Muay Thai Ultimate Fights 1 & 2 are still my favorites."
3,deceptive,"I bought this dvd for my sons who are all brown belts in karate, they thought that there should have been real fights."
3,Very good len except auto-focus issue,"The lens really produce a great image especially in low light. The quality of the picture is very high and the price is very cheap with this level of aperture (f/1.4). The 30mm is the best distance to take person or small group pictures during dinner when the light is very dim (which we do most of the time). However, the auto focus is not working well especially in a very white background or close distance. So if you do manual focus, it will be the best lens for u for low light!"
4,does what I want,"I don't shoot with flash, so fast lenses are important to me. I've used this lens for four years, and haven't run into any focusing or other hardware issues. That's just the luck of the draw, I guess. I didn't want to spend the money on a comparable Nikkor lens, and for me, this has worked out. For the last year and a half, it's the lens that's generally already on my husband's camera. So not only is it still working, but it's been stolen from me."
5,Perfect as a 50mm Equivalent Prime on a EOS 7D,"I purchased this with one thing in mind- to make it my standard carry lens for my EOS 7D and my EOS 500D. Prior to this, I was carrying a 50mm 1.8II Canon. The Sigma outshines the Canon in every wide aperture up until 2.8 where there is no difference. The Sigma makes excellent bokeh wide open, and is extremely useful in low light and indoor photography- even at ISO 100. The outofocus is responsive and quiet, the manual focus ring is also easy to operate. I am very happy with this lens.The build is heavy and solid. The lens diameter is 62mm. The lens is very attractive on my cameras.This is a very good investment that has produced pleasing results."
4,Very Good for it's price,"It's nicely built, very fast thanks to it's F/1.4 and has very smooth and quite autofocus.As most of reviews noted, it is very soft in the corners when stopped down but with this kind of lens, you don't really care for the edges, especially as you get a wider angle than most of it's competitors in the category.I am very pleased with it, but if you are looking for a good portrait lens i would recommend the CANON 50mm F/1.4 instead.it will be much sharper at corners and will cost less."
2,I REALLY wanted to like it but I just can't,I got this for shooting semi-adequately lighted stage shows. The first night I received it I shot mostly at f1.4 and 2.0. I filled two CF cards and couldn't wait to get home to check the results. Nearly 80% were out of focus! Every one that was off was focused at a point about 5 feet upstage. I thought about keeping it as a manual lens because I really liked the brightness but I couldn't justify the cost so I took advantage of Amazon's return policy (Thanks Amazon!) Maybe I just got a bad one but it spooked me. Looking seriously at a Tokina now.
1,Sad purchase...,"I used some Sigma lenses on Nikon DSLR for few years. It produce very good images with a reasonable price. I love it. The lenses haven't got any problem...I just recently got the new Canon DSLR(T2i/550D). Because I had good experience with Sigma, I'm confident to purchased two Sigma lenses, which are 30mm F/1.4 and 50mm F/1.4. However, ""both"" of them have serious front focus problem... I tested almost a thousand shots. Literally, anything I aim for are blurry. Therefore, I need to send it to Sigma and see if they can calibrate them...Since both lenses have front focus problem, I ifwonder it's incompatible with newer Canon dSLR systems. Beware when you purchase it. Maybe I should have get Canon branded lenses instead..."
5,This one's a keeper.,"I like the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens, but I HATE that it's 50mm. Yeah it's 1/5th the price of this lens, but I absolutely hate having to back up so far to take shots. The crop factor of the 30mm isn't as bad. The f/1.4 definitely makes it a good shooter under low lighting. But a lot of the time the picture gets too fuzzy when the aperture is too high. But overall I really like the lens."
2,Be aware of front focusing copies,"It's a superb lens if you get a good copy or get it calibrated by Sigma but if you are unlucky like many are with this lens, you will get soft photos due to the front focusing issue."
4,"Some issue with the focus, otherwise, excellent lens","Nice lens, I bought it for my camera Canon Rebel T1i. The lens has some difficulty to focus in low light conditions (as stated in previous reviews), but it does focus. As for the sharpness I have to agree that it's not the best at f/1.4 but it is good as you reduce the aperture. I think it's a good price/quality lens."
2,Defective copies seem to be common,"So I did my homework before purchasing the sigma 30mm 1.4. Research showed that bad copies are frequent. Hoping that I wouldn't get the bad copy I went ahead and purchased it because I wanted a prime that would be roughly 50mm on my Canon 7d's crop sensor.Boy did I make the wrong choice because I got a bad copy. My kit lens is better/easier to focus. The focus ring was stiff and had play. Focusing with this lens is like painting with cerebral palsy.I am returning this lens and just purchased he Canon 35mm 1.4 L. Its way more expensive but I know that I will never have an issue with this superior lens.If you do buy the sigma 30mm lens make sure you do autofocusing tests to see if you were one of the unlucky many to receive a defective lens. If the focus ring feels wrong in your hands, its probably because its not a good lens."
1,focus problem,"Read about the ""front focus"" problem, but took a chance anyway. Did an experiment comparing this lens with Nikon 50mm f/1.8. Sigma focused in front of the object while the Nikon was right on! Sent the lens back using Amazon's very friendly return policy."
1,Two sigma lenses both broken,I bought two sigma lenses and I loved them for about 6 months. Now both are broken and Sigma service sucks. Save yourself a headache and don't buy sigma.
2,Yes virginia there is a focusing issue w/ this lens,"When I bought this lens for my Canon 450D, I did not do enough research about the poor quality of Sigma lenses. My suggestion is to take a look at Canon's 28mm EF and 35mm lens as possible alternatives to this lens. Like other reviewers my instance of this lens tends to focus in front of the subject I want and not on the subject. Thus, resulting in an out of focus/fuzzy picture. I've been forced to manually focus this lens if I desire my subject to be in focus. This really reduces the number of photos I can take per given amount of time and the situations where I can use this lens."
2,What could have been,"I had very high hopes for this lens. And, out of the box, beatifully constructed. Unfortunately, it front focuses repeatedly. This is a known problem with some sigma 35/camera combo's. See the reviews on photo.netThe body used was a d90.I emailed sigma-they offered to calibrate it, AFTER I filled out the warranty. Meaning I could not return it. If they were unable to calibrate it, I could not return it. Not a risk I wanted to take.I really wanted this lens to work-but it had to go back. If you get a good copy, great. Still, I expect it to work as advertised out of the box. (I had the opposite experience with a Tokina 11-16. There are also some bad copies, apparently, floating around. But mine is excellent. Sharp focus and corners quite sharp wide open.)Since Amazon has a solid return policy, you can order one. If it works well for your body, great. If not, it's only a minor inconvenience to return it."
5,"Superb lens, brilliant images, razor sharp!","Brief and simple, super quiet focus.Amazing pictures, colors are brilliant even at low light.Close up images at 1.4 are super razor sharp.Recommended, extremely happy that I bought it. A lens that will make a normal light look amazing. Took a trip to NASA Kennedy Space Center where there is all the tech shinny metal surfaces, glass, electronics and this lens was just incredible how it captured light, glassy surfaces, crisp edges etc.Its a little tricky as this lens is very precise when focusing, sometimes you have to play a little with the White Balance and under-over expose to bring up the shine or get more shadows etc. I prefer to use my D60 with D-Lightning and Noise Reduction off, but thats just me with this lens. Focusing is super fast quiet.Highly recommended!"
2,I don't recommend this lens,"I had 3 copies of this lens. None of them were focusing correctly. Most of time it will front focus by 1 inch. It's kinda random, hit or miss. It's probably okay for many people but I am spoiled by other good prime lenses. Even when it was in focus, it wasn't sharp enough for me. You get what you paid for. It may work in certain situations like shooting in extremely low light. If you are picky about sharpness and image quality, stay away."
5,Nice glass,"Lots of glass, which makes the lens a tad heavy. Depth of field is impressive. I haven't experienced the focusing problems that some other people have described. Overall, this is a great lens for relatively dark and/or indoor lighting. As expected with f/1.4, the bokeh is just gorgeous."
1,Broke In Two Years,"Not sure about this lens. It was great while it was working. No more than 1000 frames through it and two years later and my camera gave the ""Lens not attached"" signal today. When I detached the lens, noticed that the lens inside wiggles a bit. I guess you get what you paid for got me once again..."
1,Loved it for about a year and now it wont focus well,"It was always hard to get things in focus (but when you shoot f1.4 it's usually harder) still I felt the lens's focus system is not the best. Then after a while it just stopped responding well it only focuses well when I'm close to the subject and the background has a weird radial blur that didn't have before.Great lense, if it worked."
5,Superb indoor non/flash portrait lens,"I bought the Sigma 30mm with my Canon Rebel xti and couldn't be happier for the purpose I bought it. I've been using it for indoor baby photos but didn't want to use my flash and mainly use the available room light. It works fantastic, bringing out deep rich colors in the room and opened all the way up to f1.4 provides very sharp portraits of our baby. Its light weight and compact size are also pluses. I have used it outdoors only occassionaly and have seen no issues except for some night shots where some light points show some abberations. These dissappear depending on the angle you shoot to the light source."
2,Autofocus problem is for real,"I really wanted to like this lens. It has good build quality, is fast, comes with a lens hood and case, has a 4 year warranty, has HSM which I believe is similar to Canon's USM and makes for quiet, fast focusing, and is a great focal length (equivalent to 50 mm) for my Canon 30D. I was planning to use it for indoor shots without a flash. HOWEVER, it really does have problems getting the subject in focus. This does not seem to be just a function of the narrow depth-of field. The Canon 50 mm 1.4 (A GREAT lens, by the way) doesn't have this problem at f/1.4. I'm going to try the Canon 28 mm f/1.8."
4,great lens for the price,"Normally I am not a fan of sigma products, in general I find it worth the extra money to get a canon lens. The Sigma 30mm is the exception. I use this as my walk around lens for my rebel xti and couldn't be happier with the quality. Some very minor focus issues at close range or low-light conditions, but as it has already been mentioned nothing that can't be overcome by a little ingenuity. If you're looking for a good prime lens on par with canon for less money, this is the lens for you."
2,another front focussing copy...,"I tested it and it was front focussing quite badly. I don't have the nerve to send camera and lens to Sigma for calibration, so back to Amazon it went. I'll stay with Canon lenses."
4,Darn Nice!,"Well built. pretty darn sharp (except when wide open). The perfect focal length on an APS-C sensor to equal the traditional ""normal"" lens."
3,More Focusing Problems,"I bought this lens for my rebel xt for low-light indoor situations, but soon discovered that it was not focusing correctly at wide apertures. I thought it might be a depth of field issue or that somehow I was making the mistake with the camera. I even adjusted the AF to focus only on the center point and continued getting fuzzy pictures.I compared this lens side by side with my Canon 50 f/1.4 with all conditions being equal, and the Canon lens was flawless.I noticed that other people had similar problems so I called the Sigma Customer Service. They were very rude and told me that it was a user problem and not a lens problem.The lens is boxed up and ready to go back to Sigma. Hopefully they can fix it or give me a replacement.Beware of this lens and focusing problems!"
5,Great lens!,This is a great little lens for the price. I have gotten loads of use out of it. The pictures come out great!
5,Outstanding Glass,"I was a little reserved before making the purchase. However, all my doubts were instantly relieved by the quality of this lens. It is extremely good in low lights. I have not experienced any problems with sharpness even at 1.4. I'd said it's the sharpest at somewhere between 1.8-2.8.For more than 2 weeks now, the Sigma has stayed on my 60D most of the time, replacing my beloved 24-105L as my most used lens(which is rather unexpected.)"
2,Seems to have focus issues on my 40D.,"I used this lens on my XTi with good results. After upgrading to a 40D, many of my shots were not focused properly. I thought it was the camera but it (apparently) was not. The lens is great from f4 to f16. But from f1.4 to f2.8 the images were not sharp. This was with careful testing using tripod, focus charts, remote shutter release, etc. It's not my failure to understand depth of field. I returned the lens."
5,What I wanted,"Great Lens. Works well in low light, no focus hesitation. It's quick and quiet. Gives me great control of depth of field, which was my primary concern. It's heavier than I expected, espcially when compaired to Olympus 4/3rds system lenses, but it's solid and well constructed.I recommend it as a standard lens for those looking for good depth of field control or who need to shoot in darker environments."
5,This is a remarkable bargain!,"This is a remarkable lens. At about 1/3 the price of the comparable 35/1.4L, the lens delivers sharp contrasty pictures throughout all apertures. Note, the center is sharp at 1.4, not sharp for 1.4.As some reviewers have noted, its main weakness is soft corners at extremely wide apertures. I don't consider that a liability since one typically uses the widest apertures to isolate the subject. The bokeh and color are ok, but not as impressive as the 50/1.4 or the L zooms.The main problem with this lens is QC. I got a copy that squeaked occasionally, and also had problems focussing consistently on objects further away than some distance. Sending the lens back to Sigma for calibration fixed the focussing issue perfectly. The squeaking is still there, but I understand from other users that it's normal, and in any case doesn't detract from the operation of the lens."
4,"Good Prime Lens, But Some Issues","I got this lens about 1 month ago and I really like it. It is pretty soft at f/1.4, but does get much sharper from f/1.8 on which makes it still very useful in low light. I have not had any focus issues with my copy and it focuses accurately at any distance. I do wish it focused closer than 15.5 inches though. I do think that Sigma has some significant quality control issues though as I reported in my review of their 70mm f/2.8 macro I recently bought. I go the macro after this lens because I was happy with it. When I brought my macro lens to the service center, who also services Canon, Nikon and Tamron lenses and they told me that they get more Sigma by far than any other brand with service issues even with brand new lenses."
1,So much potential; so little QC,"I tried four copies; three were bad, one was awful. This lens has been very favorably reviewed, and I find their 50 f1.4 to be magnificent, so I took a chance. The only thing I can think, based on what I saw in the files, is that in each case, one or more of the elements was out of alignment, because they didn't produce a normally focused image at any focus distance. Something 10 feet away on one side would be in focus, and something fifty feet away on the other side would be. Very strange."
2,Not Good For Video,"The picture quality is amazing, very vibrant and crystal clear. Going to 1.4 is a huge plus for video in low light... however, only buy this if you plan to buy a new one every 3 months. Since for video we can't rely on autofocus and have to manually, constantly, be sliding the focus ring around, it breaks. The focus ring now slips constantly as I try to pul focus, which means if you're shooting something important like a wedding where you only have ONE chance to get the shot, this poorly made focus ring can kill your shot if it decides to slip on you.Buyer beware."
3,OK lens after calibration,"Some points I want to share with those who are planning to purchase the lens for a Nikon body:1. Both lens I received have autofocus issue in the VF mode and both generate soft images.2. Both lens have almost no autofocus issue in the LV mode, and generate sharp images most of the time even at F/1.4.3. After obtain the second lens with the same problem (AF), I realize that this is not a QA problem.4. Sent the second lens to Sigma (with my camera body). Sigma said that they had uploaded the Nikon firmware to thelens. Sigma sent the lens/camera back to me within 48 hrs after they received them.5. Lens came back with better AF.6. Sharp above F2.8.7. Do not buy a ""used"" or ""like new"" one, because you do need the four year warranty (for future calibration).8. Do not send the lens back to Amazon, because you will generate more ""like new"" lens.9. If I have a choice again, I will go with the Nikon f/1.8........."
2,"Focus Issues, Overpriced","I bought this lens for my D40 (for $375), but ended up returning it. At the time, it was the only auto focusing 30mm prime available for the D40.Upon receiving the lens, I shot with it for a week but kept noticing my focus wasn't quite right. This was much more noticeable in some shots than others. In addition, the lens added a yellow cast to my images.After doing some research, it turns out the Sigma 30mm f1.4 is known to have both focus and cast issues. After doing more extensive tests with a focus chart, it was very apparent my lens was backfocusing about .3-.5"". Not good. I could have sent it to Sigma to re-calibration, but for that much money, no thanks. In fact, I'll be very cautious of every buying a non-Nikon branded lens again.Luckily, Nikon announced it will be selling it's own 35mm f1.8 at the beginning of March 2009. Oh, and what's even better? It's going to be priced at $199 US. Initial reviews have been very good. I've already pre-ordered mine."
4,sturdy,"I JUST got the lens. Literally 15 minutes ago. So this review will be based on the very first impression. I got it instead of Nikon 35 mm f/1.8. I have Nikon D5100. I read many reviews and thought this lens would be fab to have.So far the pros are: sturdy! Compare to Nikon 35mm this lens is a lot heavier, made out of metal and is overall more sturdy. Comes in a very nice case.Cons: it doesn't autofocus in live view. Surprise! That is really not good because I like the flip screen on my D5100 and I like various angles and live view really helps. With this lens I will have to look into the viewfinder. I photographed in a low light and it takes some time for the lens to autofocus. There is no rear cup (may be because of how the case is made or may be I just got a copy that did not have a rear cup?). I am yet to test it in a day light to decide if trading it from Nikon 35mm f1.8 was worth it.So far it is a 4 out of 5."
5,Good Standard,This lens has its issues but they can be worked around.Light meter reads wrong.Focus on D200 if not correct if set to anything to center.Image quality is great.HSM is a bit louder than I would have thought.All in all I am happy with the lens for my uses.
2,Great Lens....Until it fell apart.,"Howdy folks! I was searching for a fast lens on the (sort of) cheap and settled for this here Sigma. For a long time we were the closest of pals. Awesome focal length, and 1.4 aperture meant I was shootin' up a storm in some serious low light conditions.This happy marriage between my sigma and I went on for several years. Until one day I picked it up and a large portion of the lens just fell out.....Doh.......It was the very center piece on the back of the lens. I took it to a local photography store and it turns out I could just screw it back with my hand! Wha????So now if i take a photo is looks like it was taken through a 3-inch piece of plastic. No me gusta.My old partner is now a 450 dollar paperweight.Not sure how I feel about Sigma lenses anymore."
5,Great Lens,If you want a 50mm lens for a APC DSLR this is the lens for you. It's sharp and creates great DOF. Plus the build quaility is amazing.
5,ez lock pet screen,this came very fast. It works great on my old tank that my dad gave my son for his hamister. I had looked at all the pet stores and different stores looking for one that fit. I would definitly get this one again and i might order another for my other hamster cage
5,"This book was really funny, I bet it was about LYNDON STATE!","This book was soooo funny! What a satire...If you have had bouts of badness with your college, get this book, it will inspire you to take action!"
4,Place all ingredients in a blender and process until smooth.,"This is a no-frills idea book. No pretty pictures, no gratuitous white-space, no full-page smoothie portraits--just a diverse yet basic collection of mostly common-ingredient smoothie suggestions.If it's bang for the buck you want, this book is money well-spent--especially if you aren't afraid to creatively enhance some of these drinks with what's on hand to make them your own.The simplicity of this spartan little book will set you and your blender free because this book is anything but intimidating; it begins with some helpful hints, several pages of possible garnishes, possible fruits, possible sweeteners, and an assortment of creamy bases.The book itself is lackluster and uninteresting but it works for me. Actually, I like the nuts-and-bolts approach. You're buying recipies here, not a smoothie video. If it's important that the color of your smoothie match your tablecloth and napkins, better try a different book."
5,Great book for a rookie,"Nobody would confuse me with a good cook, but this book gets my total endorsement. Simple, straight forward ingredients that result in tasty drinks. Also includes helpful hints that were, not surprisingly, new to me."
2,Not enough variety,"I was very disappointed in this book. I had expected much more. There wasn't enough variety or types of smoothie recipes for me, and the ones that were there weren't to my liking. I ended up giving the boook away."
3,You get what you pay for,"Overall this is a good book. Since I am a finiky eater, there were only a few recipies that appealed to me. For those who like an array of fruits this book is great. It is also very simple to follow."
3,buen librito,"si lo que buscan es un libro de recetas, es un buen librito (es pequeño), tiene buenas recetas y los ingredientes en general que pueden usarse en estas bebidas, algunos tips también, no es profundo pero si lo que quieres son recetas, ahí lo tienes...."
5,GREAT SERVICE:),I recieved to book with-in 4 days of placing the order.I'm very pleased with the book & the prompt service I recieved!I would order from them again.
2,Don't call it clairvoyance,"This book was disappointing. I have read in many books on psychic subjects that clairvoyance means 'clear seeing' and refers to actually seeing visions, beings, auras and other 'other-worldly' things with the third eye.This book explains clairvoyance differently - as intuition in general.It claims to be a guide to development, but offers nothing meaty that you can sink your teeth into and practice. It's really a childrens book with lots of pictures."
2,VERY SMALL!,"Item arrived quickly, packaged great - if I was commenting on just the shipping - they'd get 5 stars. The item is SMALL! Not as tall as a pair of scissors and certainly not medium sized in any sense. Not at all worth the money. I purchased this as well as an ""xtra large"" to put in a tall 55 gallon tank, the xlarge hasnt arrived yet, but if the medium is anything to go by, I'm going to have to figure out some other way to decorate my tank. Dont waste your money."
4,Very realistic,Great looking plastic decoration. Many people have commented that it looks real. Easy to clean with a small toothbrush. The only thing I don't like is that the stump-like base of it was not flat so it's hard to stand up in sand (I have mine standing like a tree and have moss growing on the branches).
4,Good camcorder for the money,"I purchased the HC36 as a backup to a Sony VX2000. I filmed a play in low light and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the video. I was able to intermix the video from the HC36 with the VX2000 with only a slight difference in quality. The onboard mic was also excellent! more than I expected. I hadn't planned on using the audio from this camcorder, but in the end I did use about 20% of the audio for a 2-hour production.I have owned several camcorders over the years and I'm always pleased with the quality of Sony. I will definitely use the HC36 as a backup for wedding shoots."
4,You get what you pay...,"I bought it a week ago. Tried some shooting and transfered from HC36 tape to PC smoothly with firewire connection (not USB)and Windows Movie Maker/Sony Vegas 6.0. The picture quality is good for resolution up to 720x480 (high quality). Don't expect too much from this handycam, only the basic video shooting will do. If you want to make 'Hollywood-like' movie, this is not the right choice. You need to have spare battery, the standard is about 80 minutes. One of the reason I chose Sony HC series is you can have an optional battery(NPFP90) up to around 500 minutes. For me it is important as I don't want to carry a lot of spare batteries and keep changing batteries while travelling in remote area.For me it's a good product for what I paid."
3,"Nice features, poor play-back video quality...","All,This camera is packed with features, almost too many. If you've worked with other hitech devices the menu is very logical. The play-back video quality is kind of grainy and my older chunky Sony Camcorder has better picture quality, I expected better from this newer model. Camera is not for the beginner. This model comes with all the cables. The model below this (HC-32) comes without some of the cables and the features of this one. So better to spend the extra money and get this one than go searching on e-bay for all the obscure connectors. Being able to record onto Memory Stick Duo Pro is neat, but quality is even lower and they don't give you a starter stick. You need a real steady hand with this camera. The camera is incredibly compact./Brian"
3,It's ok ... nothing special. And the night vision is useless,"I just bought this because my panasonic minidv broke (tape insert would not open). I thought this would be cool, because of the built in night vision. However, this is a totally useless feature. It turns everything into black & white, and makes everyone's eyes look like big white dots like a deer staring into a headlight of the car. Certainly not a way you want to remember family events, which is what I purchased this for. If I can do it over again, I would buy something that has a light mounted on the front of the camera. This nightvision feature is useless. Overall, the camera records moview, so I guess it works fine."
2,colour is not good,DCR HC36. I bought this camera just two days before. But the colour quality is not at the expected level.It is showing only 50 % of the colours. I dont know what to do?I spent a lot of money to buy the camera.If any others are facing the same problem please let me know.Only my camera is like that or all sony cameras are like that.
1,Not Compatible with Windows 7,"Although this camera takes great video, there are currently no software drivers to stream video to Windows 7 computers. Sony has either not created the drivers or has not released them. Either way, this camera is outdated and not functional in today's video/computing workspace. Go with a more recent camera that is supported by Windows 7."
4,Sony DCR-HC36 MiniDV,"Overall, I am satisfied with the camera. I did not like the software which came with the camera. It appeared to be very basic, and I prefer using Studio. The transfer images are better than analog, but still are not as crisp as when played directly to a TV. It is relatively simple to use, but I find myself continuing to go back to the manual for some applications.For the money it is possibly a very good camera and very adequate for home use to record the special memories."
2,Sony DCR-HC36...Buyer beware!!!,"I purchased the Sony DCR-HC36 last December(2006) and while the picture quality was just 'okay' for us, we were content for a year. Recently though when we try to capture the video on any one of our computers (via USB)the picture is broken-down into digital squares and unlegible as well as there is no sound. I downloaded fresh drivers and installed them but nothing worked. We have only used the camera a total of 25 times and it has never been dropped or banged around but it is putting garbage now and we can't seem to figure out why. The Sony site does NOT have a troubleshooting link to help figure this out and we refuse to put a dime into getting it repaiered since it really is not that good of a deal anyway. We do NOT recommend this camera to anyone. Do your research."
5,Perfect,I needed some folders for some school projects and did not like the ones at the store. These were perfect.
2,several problems with this product.,I bought this one because it was cheaper. You get what you pay for. I can no longer use them because I dropped them on a pergo wood floor and they fractured in half at the nose piece. Also they gave a weirder look through the lens than other varieties I have used. Also the rubber covers for the end of the clip on prongs kept falling off until they finally fell off when I didn't notice and were lost forever. Lastly they do not flip up vertically and give a strange off camber feel when they are up. I am now buying the more pricy ones.
2,Don't waste your money!,These are a waste of money. Don't bother with these! They are not nearly powerful enough to make a difference.
3,"Work well enough, but way to heavy.","I think the title says it all. I bought these clip ons to put over my regular glasses for very close up work on computers. They do the job, but are so heavy they slip around a lot and cause my glasses to slid down my nose."
2,Optial Clip on and magnifyer,Wouldn't work with my glasses. I have tri focals and the magnifiation of the lens are at the bottom ofthe lens.
1,Magnifying glasses,These are not worth buying. I bought them for my 94 year old mother to help her read and sew but she can't see clearly through them and I can't either.
3,Not quite what I expected,"I expected the to just be a times 2, at any distance, but the magnification only works well at close range, which was not the use I had in mind/"
1,Worthless,"I bought the 2x and they work great if what I'm looking at is 3""-4"" from my face. Any further away and it's blurry. Maybe the lower powered lens would give you more focal length, I can't imagine what I could use these for."
2,Meh,"I thought my grandfather would like these for when he's working on things instead of using his larger harder to use set. Sadly, he didn't see the need to, so we just put them away for later. They do work though, when you need them."
3,For very close correction,"I really wanted these for helping me with my beading -- those tiny beads just keep getting tinier! Although the glasses work well and are comfortable clipped on my glasses, the focal point is very close. It takes a lot of getting used to."
3,"Too narrow, too heavy!","The lenses are clear, but it seems to narrow between the two lenses for my eyes, and also the weight (due to the clip-on mechanism) seems a bit too heavy ( compared to the weight of a sun glass clip on that I bought from a local Walgreen). So it was not very comfortable, but it does the job."
4,Fishing With Magnifier,Coincidentally I received this request for a review the day after using the magnifying clip-ons for the first time. They worked well for tying on flies and leaders during a day long fly fishing activity. The only weakness seemed to be the rubber protective caps which keep the wire frame from scratching the lenses are not securely attached. One came off as I was flipping them up and fortunately I saw it. I will put a drop of adhesive in each and re-seat them prior to next use. Otherwise I was pleased with the improvement in close-up vision allowing the fly attachment to be more rapid.
1,Makes vision worse,The lenses only work if you take them off and hold them against the paper or hold the paper against the lenses while on. Don't waste your money on this vision aid.
2,Dreadful Sound,"This set is seriously compromised by the poor quality of its sound. Everything is so heavily swathed in electronic fog, and the voices are so often recessed in relation to the orchestra, that it requires a continual effort of concentration to hear the singing at all. Sad to say, the performance's merits are effectively canceled by the recording's technical deficiencies."
1,"Art, Anyone?","John Adams' ENTIRE oeuvre can be summarized as follows: like Haydn, he is a superb craftsman. But, where's the art?"
2,"""Missing"" ""Missing"" ""Missing""","This piece is brilliant and evocative on the first listening. The second time, and thereafter, it's the equivalent of watching CNN at 3 a.m.--the same stuff they've broadcast all the previous day, run over and over. The music is in thrall to an historical event nearly beyond the ken of mortals, and thus, music is not is what ""listened to."""
2,a dissapointment,"I was looking for something innovative or interesting. Instead I got 25 min. of reading of the names of people who died in 911. The orchestral accompaniment had a movie music quality....while there are some ok moments, it is just too formulaic for me. I gave the CD away.I really enjoyed his earlier works, like Shaker Loops, Nixon in China, ect. I would buy those first. Unlike this piece, they are worth listening to over and over."
2,A very weak piece,"There are a number of 20th century memorial or funereal works which are completely successful at conjuring the depths of human loss, such as Franz Schmidt's 4th Symphony, Karl Amadeus Hartmann's Concerto Funebre, Henryk Gorecki's 3rd Symphony, Benjamin Lees' ""Memorial Candles"" Symphony, Joseph Suk's Asrael Symphony or Silvestrov's Requiem for Larissa (which probably should have won a grammy). Adam's Transmigration comes not even close to those masterpieces. Having heard this piece several times, I can honestly say that its content completely fails to do justice to its chosen subject matter. No catharsis, no peroration, no truly felt sense of loss, just gimmicky mixed media techniques. It just fails to rise to the occasion of such horrible loss. Whatever one may think of Adams' other music, he is decidely no hack, so two stars for the old college try.Save your money or seek out the pieces named above. Who says Grammies can't be bought? You gotta love New York..."
5,Commemorating 9/11,"A profoundly effective remembrance of 9/11. It is good that music, poetry and other artistic expressions about9/11 are being produced. I take it as a sign of our gradual healing and ability to move beyond the trauma. And of course, the performance and artists are very good."
4,Heart-wrenching,"This peice is one of those that you can listen to once, and have to seriously think about your existance before you even try to listen to it again. It is powerful beyond words. If your gonna listen to this, be open to all forms of musical expression, from hearing tapings from a corner of the street, to full orchestra and choir going full at it. I highly recommend it!"
1,Viewing footage was next to impossible.,I could not view old footage with this camera. When I put in to view old footage from my miniDV tapes the picture would flicker constantly. The camera is not compatible with my iMac and the became a even bigger problem than the old footage flickering. I was pleased that I was able to return the camera and get full refund including shipping. I've never had such a pleasant return experience so that made up for the disappointment.
3,Why even have still botton,"I just bought this camere form Circuscity for $171, and found out that it kind of mis lead with a Still botton, this camera only take low quality still picture and record it in the tape not SD card.I think it is ok because most Camdorder are not taking good still picture any way.I was always go for canon, but this time I try the Samsung, I hope the Koraen co are as good as Canon. The price is good,"
4,overall good product for cost,"The camera is nice and compact and it seems to video a fairly clear picture. I have only used it indoors so far. For the cost and for the fact that it's my first video camera, it's a good value. However it may be worth spending the extra money to upgrade to the next model so that you can use a memory card."
1,used Samsung SC-D372 Camcorder,When I received this unit it was improperly packaged in a cardboard box with no-zero-packaging material. The camcorder and the power module were bouncing around off of each other. Upon inspection and attempt to load a cassette cartridge I found that the switch to open the tape cassette holder was missing from the unit. Therefore the unit does not work. I contacted the shipper and was told by the company that I was a liar and that I was attempting to defraud them and they would not either replkace the unit nor refund my money.As a result of having been ripped off by this Amazon provider I will never again purchase any used items from Amazon.
3,Retell a clasic in colloquial terms,"A retelling of the classic The Tempest with a twist! As the sailor Jasper finally finds an island to land after falling overboard he thinks in his dying breath of a beautiful woman of his dreams, she springs from his head and is made real. She waits on the island for another human to come and give her the power to explore the world around her.http://dailylitmajor.blogspot.com/2008/09/review-ariel-by-grace-tiffany.html"
2,The Tempest... in a teapot,"One of the only good things to be said about Ariel is that it was a quick read. I'm sorry to report that I did not enjoy the experience. Though the basis was extremely interesting to me (while I have not read The Tempest, I greatly enjoy Shakespeare and tales concerning him and his plays), the execution was amateur.In the end, I didn't understand the point. I wasn't left with that wonderful sense of awe one is supposed to have upon finishing a book. It all seemed aimless and hasty. The climax could hardly be described as such (so abrupt!). There were no clever plot twists (I wasn't even amused by the allusion at the end). The characters were too inhuman to relate to - I really ended up hating most of them.On the bright side, I am much more interested in reading The Tempest itself now, for I'd like to see how it compares with this novel."
2,too small!,"nice, useful gadget but TOO SMALL - not for two or more cups of tea or coffee! That limits its usefulness. Make one NO LESS THAN 3 CUPS and you'll sell a lot more."
4,Micro Kettle,"I bought myself a Micro Kettle for Christmas. I love it so much I am online looking for two more for my Mom & Sister. I do agree that a 3 cup size would be better. But it doesn't take long to boil and if I am serving hot cocoa to the kids, I just refill and start the microwave again. The best invention I can think of for the microwave."
1,It self destructs,I really liked this product until the lid started sparking and melting in the microwave this morning. It seemed to be burning from the inside out. Must be something wrong with whatever metal they use inside the lid. Could be something to do with the age and usage of the product.Left a stinky burning plastic smell throughout my kitchen. I'd recommend using caution and not leaving it unattended when boiling water in the microwave.
5,Best little Kettle you can own.,This kettle is great. It holds 2 cups of water and when you take it out of the microwave you don't have to worry about burning yourself because it comes with a lid. Great item to use at home or the office. Purchased several for home and office use and have giving them away as gifts. Great little gift for the person who has everything.
2,"Weighted lid, by what?","Used multiple times daily for nearly a year, but now only without the lid/whistle. Bought in a local store by my wife, as a gift for me, to help me remember to finish making my coffee. She tires of hearing the reminder beep of the microwave every minute for extended periods. Whistle plug end of the bubbler arm recess developed small cracks. Sooty deposits developed, even to the point of turning the water gray a time or two before I discovered the cause. I thought I had allowed instant coffee to get into the kettle, but had not. On removing the silicon rubber rim seal, I found the cracking to be greater than first detected. Fearing lead or some other Chinese surprise, I looked for a country of origin, but it must have been only on the packaging. Found no info on Progressive website. Not recommended."
1,Worked Well Until It Caught Fire,"My sample worked well for about a year. Then it developed a 'hot spot' in the lid that started to burn and melt during cooking. As of this writing, the manufacturer, Progressive International no longer shows this product on their website. That plus some other reviews makes me wonder whether any defect extends beyond my sample. I have gone back to my conventional teakettle."
5,This is a great gadget!,"I received one of these last Christmas and was underwhelmed. But then I ended up using it every day to boil water for tea, oatmeal, or whatever. It became a regular appliance for the whole family. Ended up giving a bunch of them this year as stocking stuffers for Christmas and everyone was surprised by how much they used them. The kettle has survived a couple of drops and daily usage without gathering any mineral deposits or any other real signs of wear. And the whistle still whistles."
3,Caught on fire,"I have purchased several Micro Kettles and have had great results...just love them...however, recently, the lid of one of them caught on fire while in the microwave...scary. So be sure to be close by when you are using it, just in case."
1,DANGER! F I R E H A Z A R D !,"I have owned this product for 4-5 years, but because I hate using the microwave, I rarely use it. Today I used it to boil some water. After only a few minutes in the microwave, I looked up from what I was doing in the kitchen and noticed flames and a black cloud in my microwave. I cut the power and opened the door and found that there were two burned out holes on both sides of the slope of the kettle's hood, and two corresponding protrusions through the plastic on the underside of the hood. My microwave was covered in soot, and the acrid smell of burned plastics filled my kitchen.I see that this product is being sold at other retailers online. My recollection is that I picked mine up at the Black & Decker outlet store.Do not purchase or continue to use this unsafe product. The website for the manufacturer is [...] (located in Kent, WA). I have filed a complaint online with them tonight."
1,Dangerous product -should be discontinued,"As noted in other reviews, the product worked well until the lid started melting and burning in the microwave. There was soot all over the microwave. Lucky it didn't burn down my office building. This product is a fire hazard and should be discontinued."
4,This Works!,"My mom has had this for several years, and wanted another for a friend - only place I could find it for her was online. She much prefers it to a kettle on the stove..."
5,Microwave tea kettle,I love it. It's perfect for a couple cups of tea or coffee. It's easy to pour with the spout and small enough not to take up too much room.
5,Awesome!,"I got great insight from this handbook, it's so helpful in learning about food therapy from a traditional Chinese perspective. As far as alternative treatment goes, this book is one of the best I have ever read!It mainly serves as a handbook for Chinese medicine practitioners to provide information of dietary therapy to their patients. It recommend dietary feeding with herbal medicine or acupuncture/pediatric tuina. I gained much from the strength of treatments with the diet recommendation in here.Secondly, this book is great for parents interested in practicing Chinese dietary as a home remedy. If you fall under one of those categories, this book would be great for you!"
5,Outstanding Daily Devotional,"I purchased 5 ""Morning and Evening"" books by Charles Spurgeon. I purchased these books as gifts for families in my Church. Every single family has remarked to me how wonderful this book is for a daily devotional. I personally enjoy my own ""Morning and Evening"" and knew that Spurgeon's writings and interpretations of scripture inspire me throughout the day. I would recommend this book to any one looking for that daily inspiration that keeps one's mind meditating on God's Word - the Bible."
5,Great devotional!!,It takes a few entries to get the feel of Spurgeon. But after that point you completely LOVE this devotional. It is worth every penny. BUY IT!!!! :)
5,morning and evening:a new edition of the classic .... by ch. spurgeon,ch. spurgeon is wonderful. highly recommend it.
2,Tiny print size in Hardbound,"This is a wonderful resource. The Original is a masterpiece. The problem is that the type size in the hardbound edition is Very Small. Not suitable for anyone with less than perfect vision and a lot of light. I am Very disappointed. This publisher, Crosswayd doesn't seem to pay attention to these details."
2,Um...can hardly navigate this,"I think this is my worst review of something here. I was looking forward to reading this on my Kindle, maybe even using it in church a bit..but there are horribly misspelled words, tons of ""?"" question marks all over, and it's just plain awful. I got so fed up I just quit trying to read it after a few pages. I've gotten free stuff for my Kindle that was easier to read than this...even with some errors here and there.I paid $1.99 for this...but it should have been free! :("
1,Kindle format is TERRIBLE,"Terrific book, terrible implementation on Kindle:- line formatting is a hurge distraction; line-break are ""hard"", so changing font size doesn't help- none of the links to various days' readings work; horrible navigation- ""?"" character whenever it might be a quote or other punctuation.- it looks like a middle-school self-publishing projectDo yourself a favor and either find a better version, or use the web-based Spurgeon sites.Really -5 stars."
5,Morning and Evening C.H. Spurgeon,I purchased this book for my son for Christmas. I have read C.H. Spurgeon's Morning and Evening for years. My son is amazed by the way C.H. Spurgeon expresses the truths of Scripture and application to life.
5,TOUCHDOWN,"JOHN MADDEN SCORES BIG WITH THIS BOOK. IT IS VERY HUMOROUS, INTERESTING, AND TO THE POINT. I ENJOYED THE REHASHING OF HIS DAYS WITH THE RAIDERS. ALSO HIS EXPERIENCE WITH THE LITE BEER COMMERCIALS IS VERY FUNNY. HIS INSIGHT AND EXPERIENCE IN THE BROADCASTING WORLD MAKE THIS BOOK A VERY ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE. A MUST READ FOR ANY FAN OF FOOTBALL AND THE RAIDERS. TOUCHDOWN JOHN MADDEN!"
4,"Hey, wait a minute, I wrote a book",This book was about John Madden life when he was a coach. It talks about how after ten years of coach the Oakland Raiders. The book also talks about when he was playing football in high school and college and also when he got darfted to the NFL but during summer camp he tore his ACL and could not play football. It talks about how he started broadcasting for CBS. So throuhgout the book it talks his live and the thing he went through to get to where he was and where he is today.
5,More than average J-Goth band,"Wow, I came across D'EspairsRay by pure chance on a college video show. I'm in my 40's - I don't frequent college video channels, but it caught my eye and ear as I was flipping channels one night. The song was 'Squall', which is on this release. Checked out a few samples on youtube and decided I liked what I heard enough to buy - only to find that this CD is out of print. Enter Amazon - one of their partners had a few copies at a very reasonable price. It's been well worth it. This band does more than just Goth-metal, there are some very tasty hooks and interesting progressions. They remind me a lot of Queensryche or Evanescence at times. If that's your genre, give this band a spin."
3,"Not what I was expecting, but inspiring","I guess this product is not what I was expecting when I bought it. I`m not really sure what the target audience is either. I was expecting some ideas for getting my creative side going instead this DVD is more about one womans struggle with cancer, her survival and how she turned her battle into something creative. Not a bad idea for a home movie but I was looking for something a little more general and less about her personal life."
2,"So excited, and then So disappointed","I'm very picky about my cheese. Ask my husband. I want a perfectly sliced piece ... not too thick, but certainly a little thicker than a piece of cellophane. Which, unfortunately, is what this slicer gives. It promises thin slices, but instead gives you rice-paper thin bits that manage to get through the blade opening. Not slices, bits that looks like conffetti ... maybe it would work as a shredder ... hmmm. No, it would take forever and they would literally melt in your hand. Not worth it. Back to the search for the perfect slicer."
2,Not sturdy enough,"This is a disappointing slicer. It is very flimsy, the metal is thin. Even for med-soft cheeses like cheddar or jack. It bends back on itself as you press down & slice, your slices come out uneven and even a knife is easier. Also, you find that you push so hard to control this slicer that it sort of ""mashes"" your slice of cheese. It's not easy to manipulate. The handle is nice, but if the palette is so bendy, then the handle is of no assistance."
3,Good for household use,Not recommand for commerical use cause you only get 3 of each kind. You have to bake and re-use 4 times to make a dozen same one.
2,"very small, sharp, and rusted after first wash.","very cheap quality, sharp edges, almost too small to really use, rusted after first wash before use. Don't think I wil even use these now."
3,Handle comes off too easy!,"Good, cheap product; but the handle which is designed to come off for cleaning, also comes off too easily when you're aggressively grating a block a cheese. Not a deal breaker, if you're aware of the functionality/ cleanability trade-off."
4,What a pleasant difference!,This is so nice! What a difference it makes when you use a sharp edged grater! Parmesano Reggiano grated in no time! I love it!
1,Buy something else,"This product is not worth the money. I bought a generic grater at Walmart for 6.99 that has outlasted this one by a year. The top falls off the grater, it came warped, and it is so short that it is really hard to grate cheese on it."
1,"Dont buy, Not SmartKey","Do not buy, Amazon would NOT allow me to return the locks and the locks are not smartkey. Now I am stuck with locks I can not use because I need SmartKey tech. Therefore, I am off to Lowes to get what I need. Thanks Amazon for the misleading product placement."
3,Picture of the product is wrong.,I'm giving this 3 stars because from the picture this looks to be a smart key lock. This is NOT a smart key lock and nor do they claim it to be when you read the info about this lock. I find nothing wrong with this lock other than me thinking I was buying something else. That being said I'm not returning the lock but rather installing it for my grandmother so it works out.
5,Exactly What You See,"This snap hook was exactly what I was looking for. I had one years back that I used for my car/house keys, but lost it. I was using carabeaners for while but got over the cheap feeling of them. This serves as the Perfect replacement. Excellent for keys, and I never worry about it breaking."
1,Most disappointed,I don't know if I'll be able to finish this book because the author so completely and transparently dislikes Carl Sagan. It's hard to imagine how someone as dispicible as Sagan is depicted could have made the positive contributions to science and the interest of science that he did.
3,Overly Detailed,"This book is highly detailed. If you are looking for an exhaustive biography, this book is for you. Many chapters in the book tend to become monotonous when they attempt to dole out insignificant details which may not enhance your understanding of Carl Sagan.For anyone wanting to go real deep into Sagan and his life, this book is a good choice."
2,Oversimplification of a complex personality,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. It reminded me of a high school term paper how it continuously reflected back on the New York's World Fair and ""Pete can Fix It"" analogies for being the primary contributors to Sagan's personality. The author both applauds and criticizes Sagan for being a creative thinker. The criticism is for not being educated enough in some fields that he wrote about in his ""popular"" books. The author claims to be a fan of Carl Sagan but I don't totally believe that after reading this book. Unfortunately, I don't feel the author has enough depth in his personality to write a quality biography. This came off as superficial and an oversimplification, to which I am very disappointed."
1,TOO MUCH ABOUT THE SCIENCE AND NOT ENOUGH ABOUT THE MAN,"This book attempts to tell the story of Carl Sagan but all too often gets distracted by the science. Long complicated passages (too complicated for some amatuers) go into the science and detracts from the proposed main theme of the book, Carl Sagan. The book also is very disjointed, the author in his narraritve will skip years, even decades, in a single paragraph. And there is little insight into Sagan himself and no details on his major achievment, ""Cosmos."" This is a long,boring disapointing book about a fascinating man, all the more the pity. Save your money and go rent Cosmos or read one of Sagan's book."
2,Please compare this book with Poundstone's before buying.,"With two Sagan biographies out this year, I recommend looking them both over carefully before buying one. Of course, you can always read both. Since you are reading this, may I suggest you click over to the reviews of the Poundstone book, particularly that submitted by Nathan Cohen? I agree with it, although my information is of a much poorer quality. Perhaps neither of these books entirely succeeds in setting Sagan in context, or explaining his importance in the intellectual life of the late 20th century. Sagan was, inter alia, a one man refutation of Snow's thesis of the two cultures, and perhaps the true heir of Vannevar Bush's American optimism about the endless frontier."
1,"Given the choice, try William Poundstone's book instead.","Being a fan of biographies in general and Carl Sagan in particular, I have to say that this book was extremely disappointing. Davidson apparently felt that he was obligated to insert as many negative comments about Sagan as possible in the guise of presenting a balanced view of the man. Is it surprising that Sagan's ex-wife, Lynn Margulis, had almost nothing nice to say about him? Given that Davidson quotes her extensively throughout the book, one is led to believe that her statements are facts rather than opinions - or, more precisely, accusations. Davidson, while acknowledging Sagan's talents and intellectual achievements, also implies repeatedly that Sagan was egotistical, self-centered and self-serving in virtually everything he did. I doubt that anyone who has read Sagan's books would agree. My advice to those who want to read a biography about Sagan is to try Poundstone's book. I haven't read it yet, but it can't be worse than this one."
1,Hilariously bad writing!,"I don't know whether to give this one star for the appalling quality of Du Vall's writing or five stars for its (unintentional) entertainment value as a screamingly funny example of bad vanity-press fiction. All I can say is that when read aloud at writer's workshops, this wretched potboiler never fails to leave the audience in stitches."
3,Used the OCR oil stain remover on my Trex deck,"The OCR oil stain remover did remove the oil stains on my Trex deck but it also left a White film on the deck I used deck cleaner to remove the White film now the deck is a lighter color then the rest of the deck.I am not really sure if the color will fade back.Regards,Sharon Haines"
5,Exceeded Expectations,"It was a real gamble to order sight unseen, worry about putting together any part of it, and wonder about the quality.The shipping company was superb in following complex delivery instructions. The product top-of-the-line. What we had to put together was easy. The product exceeded are already high expectations."
2,"Not hands-on oriented, better suited for classroom.","I am a maintenance mechanic. This book reads like a dry classroom textbook. I specifically was looking for practical solutions for motor lubrication insight, such as how many pumps of grease per inch of motor shaft diameter, etc. Instead I only found the boring lubrication schedules and warnings about over lubricating. Also, we have dirty HVAC Heat Wheels and I wanted to know how to clean them. They are not even mentioned in the book! This book is of little use to me as a hands-on handbook. At a much lower price I would have given it 3 stars, but at this price it deserves only 2 stars."
5,Magnifique!,"I got this cd last year when their tour took them through NYC and Brooklyn. I've never tired of it! This year, I got their new cd Bayou Perdu when their tour brought them back through our area. Another amazing cd! If you ever get the chance to see these guys in person, do it! Their energy is amazing - especially when they start dancing on the tables! Buy this cd - you'll not regret it."
5,Toussaint,"A favorite R&B composer of mine, this is a very good collection of his work ,some hits all should have been."
1,Doesn't actually WORK,"This garlic press may look good, but I didn't think I'd be buying it purely for display! The surface area is too wide and the grip doesn't press far enough for you to get any garlic out whatsoever. I had to scoop up the mashed cloves (which were stuck in the barrel) and throw them into my old ugly but FUNCTIONAL garlic press.Don't people TRY the items they manufacture??!"
1,Totally Useless Garlic Press,"This Pedrini Garlic Press, although it LOOKS beautiful, is the worst non- functioning garlic press I ever tried. Flat pancake cloves,hardly any garlic mash comes out. Useless. (It has been sitting on my ""to-do"" pile waiting for me to try and get my money back from the company for years now...) Useless design. It gets ZERO Stars."
2,Does not sufficiently press garlic,"Although the construction is sturdy and has a nice weight to it, the product does not press the garlic very well. There is a sufficient amount of uncrushed garlic left in the basket."
3,Takes a lot of strength to mash that garlic,"The garlic press works...you just need a lot of pressure to squeeze the whole garlic out. If not, the whole garlic piece is still in the barrel. The only thing that attracted me to this press was the sleek and attractive design. It doesn't look as bulky as other garlic press. I might return it and go for the Zyliss Susi DeLuxe Garlic Press. That press has recieved a lot of good reviews. If you haven't bought one yet go read up on the zyliss."
4,could be better,"I like the garlic press, but I don't like how it leaves half of the garlic just mushed at the bottom, it doesn't all go through it."
4,Get The Party Started Right,"This CD is what music would sound like if Prince was still recording. What's that?.....He is? Ooops.....sorry...Prince.Definately a jammin' disc, it's got it all and is party ready.The only reason this got 4 stars, is because is anything really worth 5?"
5,Best CD Ever?,"Well, it's certainly the best pary CD I've ever had the good fortune to come across. It's perfect for Friday afternoon drives, parties, listening to on the way back from the dentist after being told you don't have any cavities and that you're a hygiene god... Come to think of it, there really isn't ever a time NOT to play this CD. You should be listening to it right now. What's the matter with you?"
1,"Bulky, Difficult to Use","These tongs are difficult to use, cumbersom. The length is ok, but they have no ""pick-up"" ability. The ends of the tongs are really large, and hard to be precise in picking up things. These just lay in a drawer, I use my 6-buck tongs every time. I have 4 of these 6-buck tongs, and they are the best. I would not recommend Pedrini tongs."
1,no advice,"Although the book does a good job in describing an abusive teenage relationship, she gives almost no adivce to parents except those who are in abusive relationships themselves. I thought this book would have helpful ideas in how to deal with this situation when it comes into your family but all it does is insult the parent in the end."
5,A great addition!,"As a collector of Walt Disney Treasures, this was a fantastic addition to our collection and was pleased with the care and preservation of the previous owner and the way it was packed."
4,A world without Maltin would be a happier place,"Great animation yet who needs Maltin to tell us how much we evolved from the time the ""vault"" cartoons were created??? When I see Maltin's face I would rather consider it an involution from the cute expression of Pluto ..."
4,Packaging gets cheaper every year,"This series is a dream come true since the first day of DVD. But this year the back cover is not printed on the tin but only a piece of paper poorly sticked to the box so it immediately falls apart! Also the ""bond"" around the tin was not included anymore. Beginning last year they stopped hammering the number into the metal. Cheap treatment for a prestige article."
5,My Birthday Present to me,"Actually, I was driving and I heard it on the radio. Luckily, the radio station has a website to see what played at what time. After getting goose bumps listening to the little I did on my birthday, I knew I had to have it. Its since been downloaded on my ipod. If you want to feel uplifted, and joyous listen to this wonderful CD . Kathleen Battles voice and Wynton Marsalis trumpet playing is phenominal. My favorites are the last 7 or 8 cuts of the CD especially."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS CD!,"I will admit that both Wynton Marsalis and Kathleen Battle are great musicians, but baroque music is not their forte. If you want to hear this music performed beautifully and in a baroque style (and on period instruments!), buy the Art of the Baroque Trumpet vol. 3 with Niklas Eklund and Susanna Ryden. All of the best pieces from this CD are on that one as well, Handel's Eternal Source and Let the Bright Seraphim, Scarlatti's Su le Sponde del Tebro and Arie con Tromba Solo, Stradella's Il Barcheggio, and Perderi's Pace una Volta. Eklund plays on a baroque trumpet with 8 feet of tubing. His is richer and more beautiful than anything that can be produced on a modern piccolo trumpet (only two feet long), and Susanna Ryden's smooth pure voice accompanies it perfectly. There is very good musicianship on this CD, but it does not fit the style of the music at all."
2,Large and Plasticy,I was not impressed with this product. The utensils are large and bulky and made of a very hard nylon plastic rather than a more flexible rubbery plastic which are easier to cook with. I do not recommend this item.
1,stay away,i have other mummy c/d's that are great but this ones awful!! gave it one listen and gave it away. it was punishment to listen to..
3,Sellers - please ship carefully - damage from too small shipping box!,"I WAS HAPPY TO GET THE LUCY DOLL IN A VERY TIMELY MANNER, BUT WAS DISSAPPOINTED IN THE BOX IT IS IN. IT IS CREASED ON THE SIDE FROM BEING PUT ON TOO SMALL OF A BOX FOR SHIPPING. IT IS A COLLECTIBLE DOLL AND THE CREASE IN THE BOX DECREASES ITS VALUE.I want to add that the merchant was quick to respond and went above expected to make me a very happy customer."
3,"Nice, but.....","These collectible I Love Lucy Barbies are all really great and very well made for presentation. I just wonder where the Lucy and Ethel as Martians or Lucy Goes Into The Starch Vat dolls are. I don't know who at Mattel was coming up with concepts for these dolls, and don't get me wrong, folks, they really are all great, but I just think I might have made some more imaginative choices (such as the suggestions above), over Sales Resistance, (one of my favorite episodes) which is pretty much a straightforward and bland outfit. At any rate, it's Just a thought."
3,Just enought to whet your taste....but nothing more.,"A simple, slim volume with just enough historical(?) anecdotes to entertain. Don't look for any real history here; its purely for amusement. Unfortunately, I was put off on the second page of the introduction by a glaring error the editors should have caught. The author mistakenly claims ""the equatorial sun stands still, straight overhead"" which, of course, is nonsense. The sun passes over the equator only twice a year - Mar 20 (2009) and Sep 22 (2009). Otherwise, it is moving daily either north to the Tropic of Cancer or south to the Tropic of Capricorn due to the earth's 23.5 degree tilt - which is why that wide swath around the earth is called ""the Tropics"". Gianni compounds his error by claiming it twice more in the book. Naturally, when one encounters such a blatant error at the beginning of book, it casts doubt on the veracity of the remainder. All that aside, I enjoyed it for what it was."
3,"Great, but not one of her best.","I have read every Deryni book out there at least twice and i'll be the first to admit that this one is my least favourite. She was abviously trying to catch the readers up on her visions of the Deryni, and she did that well. It's not a book you want to read if you aren't a Fan already."
3,More a Reference,This book seems to be more of a reference and informational tool in regards to the Deryni series. It isn't a book to be read and enjoyed from cover to cover.
2,"Dull, Pretentious, Pointless","I really like the Deryni series and I wanted to like this book. Too bad I just couldn't. When the author refers to quotes from her own books as ""(a character) entering something into the canon,"" you know something's not right. Though the book is helpful in compiling most of the instances of magic in the books so far, the overuse of quotes and the dull writing make this a chore to work through. Magic is classified into uses which serve as chapter headings and then doesn't keep to the subject. Not much is ""revealed"" either, or even clarified. I learned more just re-reading the original books. A definite miss."
4,Excellent Reference,"I owned this book years ago but lost it on my move to New York (I think) and I'm intending on replacing it. This book is NOT to be read like a novel but as a reference book. It was intended to be dry reading and the quotes are there for a purpose, not to inflate Kurtz's ego. If you want to know the specifics on Deryni magic that were left out of the novels, this is a good place to start. Additionally, there are some parallels to Gardnerian High Magick tradition and Catholicism within the her novels that might be pursued though this book."
4,"""Play All""?","Please let there be a ""play all"" option on the mickey b&w;!I can sit back and let the entire colletion play for my family or friends, soaking it all in. But when you have to select each cartoon one by one, it really breaks up the patience and flow.Imagine having to hit play for every song played at a party.Please let there be PLAY ALL!"
4,Good Purchase,"All I can say this is the Mickey Mouse of my grandparents. It is very good if you are one of those individuals that like to see cartoons from the past. Special features are good, and so is the art work. I Especially liked the mini documentary on old mickey mouse memorabilia."
5,Mickey vol 2 B & W,"Excellent, came in tin with litho card and all info- others boast NEW but lack all inside materials! Lost everything in Katrina!Ed Held sho buz"
4,Wished we could have gotten it....,We love the study but sadly were unable to get the quantity needed. Not Amazon's fault - publisher has minimal quantity in stock & it's not on their print list any time soon. Just an FYI as of 11/12/11 less than 250 copies in circulation.
4,Von Groove,"As a long time fan of the first Von Groove cd, I finally decided to check out some of their other releases. By chance I came across something on YouTube taken from the Mission Man release. This cd contains some great melodic hard rock. Standout tracks include Two Nights in Tokyo, and What Is Love, along with some other great tunes. I recommend checking this release out!"
5,The best shoe rack ever owned!,"We bought one shoe rack to see how we liked it. It looks nice with the Faux Leather and besides it is easy to assemble, and great for the shoes. I love how it expands to fit any closet and not too tall so fits under clothing easily. We liked it so much we ordered two more for the other closets!"
4,Sturdy and as expected,Holds my shoes just the way I expected. A shoe rack doesn't have unexpected features so normal is good. Exterior does NOt look like leather however. Was just the best color that I could find and had the three levels that I needed.
3,"You get what you pay for, and only if you're a man","Read the previous reviews on this, and they are spot on. Fine for me as I am male with size 10.5 feet. My shoes fit perfectly. My wife's would definitely slip through the gap. My principal complaint is that I need to use this at full extension, and given the weight of my shoes, I have a strong suspicion that the join of the telescopic bars will not last too long. We shall see. For now, happy enough with it. Do not expect superb workmanship or materials and you will not be disappointed. Does the job, and that's about it."
1,Poorly designed- shoes fall through and you have to rearrange every week!,"This rack would be good for big (women sized 9+ and most mens) shoes with very small heels (think men's dress shoes or women's kitten heels) only! All others slip through the bars... do not buy this rack. The construction is fine, but what were they thinking with the design? Mine is going out on the curb with a sign ""free shoe rack for someone with giant, flat shoes with small heels!"""
4,Great shoe rack for heels!,"Loved it. It arrived on time and my heels looks great on it. The three racks are perfect. I liked it that it expands without losing its sturdiness. I mainly use it for my pumps, heels, and wedges. Looks great and makes it easy to find shoes because they are all visible. The only reason I didn't give 5 starts is because I wish it would have expanded more. I had a similar shoe rack before which expanded out more than this one. Other than that, it does the job."
3,A little flimsy,"I chose this shoe rack because it was affordable and because it had 3 tiers. In retrospect, I should not have been such a cheapskate.PROS:- It will hold your shoes most of the time.- The Faux Leather is not too ugly, actually a nice touch.- It is simple and easy to put together.- It is cheap.CONS:- On occasion, some of your heavier shoes will slip off the top tier.- It is slightly delicate. It will hold shoes but it won't hold a person.- Not exceptionally sturdy... if you are in a rush and throw some shoes on it, it will shake and maybe 2 or 3 or more pairs of shoes will fall off.Overall it is functional and useful for college students, the non permanent apartment residence (if you plan to move in a year or three), and the frugal."
2,Gave it away,"We ended up giving this way because it was a failure.It is too easy for your shoes to fall down between the bars. If there was a third bar for each row, it would prevent this, but without it, it became very annoying having shoes fall down the middle. I really don't have much good to say about this product but I did give it away and the person that took it is using it daily."
1,Rickety POS,"This thing is a giant piece of crap. It's flimsy and totally unstable. When you put a pair of shoes on it, all the rest of them fall down. It sucks. I kicked mine out of frustration. Needless to say, I would recommend you stay away from this garbage and get yourself something that will last."
3,Convenient ....,"It is a very nice feature that the rack is expandable, but I would be nice that the sellers clarify that faux leather means FAKE leather. Just helps to understand what type of product the customer is buying. Other than that is a very convenient product."
4,Great shoe rack.,I like that this shoe rack can extend from small to wide. A must buy for the shoenista who has a moderate amount of shoes
4,Great to organize my shoes!,"Very easy to put together. It fit all of my shoes. The wedges were a bit tough to store on the racks though as they are high and hard to get in and out. Some of my heel hung down below causing the other shoes below to get caught. But, it does hold a lot!"
5,great for price,"I wear a size 13, and it fits five pairs of shoes per row, just can't put the bigger shoes on the bottom two racks. great and pretty sturdy, can't ask for anything more for the price"
5,Awesome!,"This is exactly what I was looking for. It expanded perfectly into my closet and it holds 18 pairs of shoes when fully expanded. It was very easy to put together! It was a great buy. I will recommend not to buy this for children shoes or small sizes, for an average size it works perfectly!"
2,Not for smaller shoes,"I purchased this product to better organize my closet space. I wear a size 7 shoe which I feel is pretty average size. Unfortunately most of my dress shoes slip through the bars and I have to put all of those shoes on the bottom rack. This is quite the opposite of what I would have hoped for. Considering this, I do regret the purchase. Otherwise, if you have a lot of tennis shoes and other casual shoes it may work just fine."
1,It's too big for size 7 [US] womens' shoes.,"I think the only people who would give this thing a high rating must work for the manufacturer.The problem with this rack is the bar design instead of using real shelves. I wear a size 7 (US) in women. Most of my shoes are too small to stay on the bars (heels AND sandals), and will just fall right in between them onto the bottom level.I think if you wear a 9 in womens' or whatever that equals in mens' or higher, you might get better use out of this. I have to buy a whole new rack now, and got screwed on this one."
2,too bulky,"Although this product sort of does the job, it's too bulky, takes up too much room and not all that easy to use. I'm old, with arthritic hands, and this just doesn't do it for me."
4,Son of the Most High,"Excellent documentary of Femi Kuti and his family and nation's musical sanctum, the New African Shrine. the focus on Femi and his commitment to music is at times touching, particularly the way in which he deals with the stage diver and his comments on the importance of music to his life. athough the comparisons with his father will probably only increase after a viewing of this (sometimes femi, shirtless and grimacing at the audience with a spliff between his fingers literally looks as if he has morphed into Fela before our eyes) the man's own musical acumen and personality comes through powerfully.definitely reccomended."
2,"good movie, terrible sound mix (2 channel)","Live at the Shrine is a great film about Femi Kuti and the scene surrounding the Shrine in Nigeria. Unfortunately, the sound mix is awful. Femi's band is pushed way into the background of the mix so you would never know he has like a dozen musicians up there. The sound is totally flat and lifeless, nothing at all like the electrifying live shows I've seen. The CD has exactly the same mix, too. Usually I'm not one to complain, especially about dry technical issues, but this seriously undermines an otherwise enjoyable concert film. What a shame."
3,Pretty Good,"If you like Femi's music, then absolutely get the DVD. Haven been to the new shrine, this sure gives a good picture of the place. Other than the music, I loved the interview with Femi's security aka ""shrine boys"", simply hilarious. The DVD would have been even better if more of the daily life in Nigeria was shown in order to provide a proper context for his lyrics.I guess I could give this 4 stars, however, it's hard when one judges Femi by Fela's standard."
5,Advanced sheetmetal fabrication,Very good book which has taught me some interesting aspects of sheetmetal fabrication. Worth buying.
2,Not advanced at all.,"Well, it's worth begin talking about the title. This is a good book, with the appeal of a serial issue of technician knowledge or whatever else. I think I bought this book by reading the title, and this is not an advanced lesson about metal fabrication or how to accurate trim sheets in order to create a shape. This is more a book written by enthusiasts for enthusiast, but only some colorfull photos and no text or formula is the reason for that price.If you really want to see Overhaulin' or Rides, this book is more of the same. Good photos but no explanation. Only if you're in need to see people working on a car, just as seen on tv."
2,Didn't work.,"Unfortunately product didn't work. Something happened in transit. However, I did get a prompt refund. I would purchase from this individual again if I needed something he had."
2,Not well put together.,"Even though the recording was packed securely in the box, when I used it for the first time the entire front came loose. Since I need the recorder for academic purposes, I could not send it back then wait for another one. Also, there was only one in stock. This time I got had!"
3,9 1/2 Week Meet Emanuelle,"CLAUDIA UDY, THE STAR OF FILMS LIKE, ""MASTER OF DRAGONARD HILL,""OUT OF CONTROL"",AND ""NIGHT FORCE"" IS AS THE TOP OF GAME. BEFORE SHARON STONE OR KIM BASINGER, CLAUDIA UDY WAS THE ACTRESS WHO MET THE EROTIC CHALLENGES IN HER MOVIES.THE MOVIE ""JOY"" IS A 1980'S MOVIE ABOUT A MODEL WHO HAS CLIENT OR MALE FRIENDS WHO TAKE HER TO TOP, BUT DON'T LET THEM CONTROL NEITHER HER DREAM OR HER INDEPENDENCE.IF YOU FAN LIKE ""EMMANUELLE"" AND ""THE STORY OF O"",YOU WOULD ENJOY THE MOVIE ""JOY"".A STRAIGHT UP NON-PC MOVIE.THIS DVD HAS INTERVIEWS BY THE STAR AND EXTRAS."
1,movie about upper class for upper class.,"Sorry to say I belong to working class people, and when I see propaganda about top 1% class well..you guess the answer. The movie suppose to be a joy, instead it reflect on France upper class in field of love and sex and as I see from movie both of mentioned are in stone age. Once in a while naked bodies in private setting, long conversations about topics, supposedly important like Tantric sex and in reality they shows us nothing giving impression the french know nothing about sex.Main chick dont have any sex appeal but this is my private opinion.Nonsense."
2,Great till it broke,"I had it for a month before the cutting wheel broke off! When it was not broken, it did work well."
1,Defective Can Opener,"The first time I attempted to use this can opener a small metal part popped off. I thought that this was a one-time defect. So, I asked for a replacement, rather than a refund. I used the new one approximately 10 times, and the same thing happened. This time I opted for a refund!"
5,"High quality, low price",The first time I used it it felt like I was opening a can made of butter. After many months it's still runs smooth and is easy to use.
1,It Broke,"I hate to report this but the Pedrini Black & Satin Classic Can Opener broke the second time I used it. The cutting wheel snapped off when I tried to open a can of Bush beans. Can't say if this is a design flaw, poor manufacturing or just a fluke but I guess I can't recommend it."
1,Cheap,"Will not work right, hangs up on one of the teeth since the tooth is bent. Cheaply made. I am not sending it back to Amazon since it is not worth my time and trouble."
4,Inexpensive and functional,"I needed something to keep at the office and that I wanted to be cheap. This works, is inexpensive (plus got it right away with Amazon Prime) and if I lose it, no big deal as it was less than $5."
1,Does NOT work! Breaks on contact!,"I bought this a little more then a month ago. The first several times I used it, it would not catch on to the side of the can it was a pain to use. Today I used it and the handle you turn just broke off. Do NOT waste your money!"
1,This is a piece of CRAP!!!!,Cheap product! Broke on first use. I'll post pictures next. I don't know how amazon can sell this type of junk product. I'm very disappointed.Please don't buy this.
1,dont buy this,"cutting wheel/blade fell right off, just like half the other reviews... seems like you have a 50% chance of getting a good one... or one that will either arrive damaged, or break on first use... i suppose this is what i get for buying a can opener on the internet..."
1,dissapointed,"I didnt realise a can opener can be a disapointment!! It does not cut the can easily- and many a time skips certain spots, so that i have to go over with the opener at least twice."
5,Can Opener,Bought this last Christmas and was very reasonably priced and is still going strong over a year later. Highly recommend.
5,big mug,"This coffee mug was larger than I expected it would be. It's quite heavy and sturdy. I love the design. I have used this for the past year and still no problems. If you have a westie or love westies, I'd recommend you to get one."
3,BEFORE YOU BUY!,"This is a really cute game that my family enjoyed. However I re-bought it on Amazon recently and when it arrived I found that it was useless to me because it was a Macintosh version and I have a pc. So I would recommend the game, but make sure to find out what version you're buying before you buy it."
3,Good but does not fit any of the cages I own at the moment,"I own 2 Green Cheek Conures and 6 cockatiels, which means I am constantly cleaning water bowels because they try to bath in them. I bought this in hopes that they would use this instead of their drinking water. While they would us this product, which is what makes it alright, it can not be hung on the cage. Even the cage I owned that should fit this would not work. I have tried 3 other cages since and none of them have worked with this product. I have placed this on the bottom of the cage and they will go down to take a bath and play in the water, however it gets so dirty being at the bottom that I would not trust it for more than the initial hour after placing it in the cage.I have yet to find a product that I like and truly works, so the sink and bath-time it is for them!"
1,Poor design chin Strap,The strap ends will not stay attached to the hard hat. The elastic strap is to long to keep tension on my chin. It will require sewing work to take up the slack.
1,Dylan's Worst Vol. 2,"It would have been quite impossible for Dylan to match ""Self Portrait"" for sheer awfulness, but he achieves that feat here. At least you could tell yourself that Dylan was trying to undeify himself with ""SP"". This one should never have been accepted by the record company - for once they should have just said ""No""."
4,If...,"If Under The Red Sky had been produced by Dylan with a seasoned touring band, it would be classic. It's the first of his ""Old Man doing modern-day old-timey country and blues and rock 'n' roll"" records."
4,Bob turns back to Woody Guthrie's' era,"Bob Dylan / Under the red sky: Sounding more like the songs of the depression era Radio days, Dylan writes and performs a set of songs (serious and funny) that harkens back to his old inspiration, Woody Guthrie (although with more modern instrumentation). There are no bad songs here, but this was definitely not what the public wanted in a Dylan album in 1990. Still, it's a good Four Star release."
4,One Of His Best,"Way underrated album from 1990. Great fairy-tale & nonsense lyrics, bluesy backing band, strong songs (Born In Time, God Knows, Handy Dandy, Cat's In The Well). This is really ""Side B"" - ""Oh Mercy"" is ""Side A"". Great stuff. Ignore the obsessives."
5,Fair review?,"I have to say, off the bat, that I am a major fan of Bob's for 13 years and would never review any of his material as bad. This album has not yet been fully digested by me but the musical accompaniments are interesting (Slash?!) and the songs have a fast beat. I am afraid I am a little biased towards my Bobby Dylan. I love the man and all his work. Seen him live twice and was never disappointed. Belong to the biggest Dylan fan site in the world ""Expecting Rain."" Perhaps the Dylanologists there can give better insight into this album if you want better specifics. There are some critical voices in the forum."
2,"He's done worse, but I'm still not digging it.","This album has its fans, but I have to side with the majority. I listened to it a dozen times, and I've tried approaching it as if it was a 'children's album,' like some claim. It's still full of stinkers. Most of the tracks are virtually non-descript or flat-out awful.A toddler could boogie to ""Wiggle Wiggle"" - it's a good, nonsense song for kids - and the title track is a nice nursery song, albeit a bit too slick. ""God Knows"" has its moments. But the rest stinks.If you're a bootleg collector, there's three tracks you should seek out. An earlier version of ""Born in Time"" was originally recorded for 'Oh Mercy' but left off the album. THAT version is a THOUSAND times better than this one. The original versions of ""T.V. Talkin' Song"" and ""Handy Dandy"" are very different from the released versions here, and they are definitely worth hearing, especially ""Handy Dandy,"" which could've been a great children's recording."
1,"Poor Bob, victim of himself!","Awful. I mean, really awful...and I liked ""Self Portrait"" because you knew Dylan was just trying to have some fun with his image. This album is just a disaster. The lyrics are OK on most songs (I've seen worse by Dylan), but the music is unexciting, not very creative, and downright embarrassing on some tracks. Why, oh, why did you have to make an album like this, Bob? Such talented people at your disposal for these sessions, and you threw it away on garbage arrangements. Shameful. Really sad."
1,"Congratulations! You have found Bob Dylan""s Worst Album","I am a huge Bob Dylan fan. I followed him through nearly all of his conversions, self absorptions and trasitions. The buck stops here! Clearly Bob was bored, went into the studio turned on the amp, called famous musicians (Harrison, Clapton and Vaughn) and played. Terrible! Its like a car accident. Even the die hardest of Dylan fans please pass."
1,Out of gas.,"I concede to nobody in my appreciation and admiration for Mr. Zimmerman as the second-greatest American musician of the rock era (Elvis, come on), but this is what it would sound like if Bob went into the studio with the dummy lyrics to every song and decided oh what the hell, let's just go with the rough draft, I've got reservations at seven. Completely without merit."
1,"Stinks, but not his worst","As a great admirer of Gianmarc Manzione's reviews I was shocked to see 5 stars next to this shlock. It is bad, very bad, but the album entitled ""Dylan"" that Columbia released at the end of '73 is the worst; but this is real bad too."
1,call a dog a dog,"Come on now you other reviewers, try being honest. I know it's Dylan but three stars?? No way. If some other schmoe puts this dreck out there, you be saying,""well, it's interesting""? Of course not! This is awful, bad, unlistenable, a waste of time, serving no purpose. He using Nursery Rhymes as a format! And you're stupid enough to listen to it? I think Dylan's having the last laugh here."
2,1 good song,saw him in concert a few weeks after the release of this- luckly he didnt do any of the songs on it- there is 1 good song t.v. talking... makes it better then world gone wrong or down in the groove or good as I been to you- or even new morning a cd thats often left off of dylans worst lists but has only 1 decent song if not for you
3,Middling Dylan,"This isn't one of Dylan's best albums, by a long shot. Forgettable in every way--a real disappointment. Only for those who want to have EVERY album he's made, And I'm actually a huge Dylan fan!"
2,Not Dylan's finest moments,"This record is completely forgettable, and could have been made by a Dylan imitator."
4,Howdy Doody is Handy Dandy?,"C'mon fellas. A lot of guys have gotten kinda lazy next to a girl named Nancy. Dont go overboard. Were George I, Cap Weinberger, Ed Meese, Bill Casey, and Ollie North Ronnie's all-girl orchestra? Maybe Wiggle Wiggle's about the Gulf War. ""Vomit fire"" & ""wiggle like a big fat snake"" are obvious textual references to cruise missiles disgorged from ships hundreds of miles away and Saddam's habit of moving his headquarters daily. And Unbelievable's about Watergate. ""Unbelievable/ strange but true/ unbelievable/ this could happen to you"". Nixon's White House paranoia, of course. Under the Red Sky's about the collapse of Soviet Russia. Well, thats a gimme..."
1,Dylan's Worst Album,"His alimony payments must have been due, or something. Despite guest appearances by the likes of Elton John and George Harrison, this album never gets off the ground. The songwriting is the worst of Dylan's long and fabled career. (The single was called ""Wiggle Wiggle,"" for God's sake!) Consistently lackluster performances fail to inject any energy into what is worse-than-mediocre material to begin with. In my opinion, there are only two reasons to actually own this horrendous album: either because you are a fanatical Dylan completist (I am), or because you're morbidly curious to see just how far a great singer/songwriter can fall in an off-year. Dylan promises that the much-anticipated second volume of his memoir, ""Chronicles,"" will deal in part with the sessions at which this travesty was recorded. I can't wait to hear his excuse for such an unmitigated disaster."
5,Little people Games-3 disk,This was a Christmas present for my niece that just turned 3 and she loves all 3 CDs. We have windows XP and she has had no problem running these disks on our system. Would definitely recommend for children 2 and up.
5,Toddlers love them,"I got this game for my toddlers and they like each of them, but most of all, they love the airport one. They get to feed dogs and cats and they love that! Also, putting the animals in the cages by picking the correct number is makes them proud.Cute characters and clear instructions to the kids is great!"
4,good for a 3 year old,The first two disks are great as soon as a child begins to understand how to use a mouse (2.5-3yrs old). The airport has much more movie-like introductions and more levels of difficulty which should be good for a 3 year old.
1,Old product in New Package,"Basically the only ""new"" part of this compilation was the Airport which is also available alone. My son just turned 4 and these CD's bored him to tears. The Farm CD is so old I assumed this ""new"" farm game was upgraded...nope...Also, while these say they run in Windows XP...you are going to get a crappy display unless you run the Farm in compatiable to Win 98 mode with 256 resolution. VERY dissapponted in these disks..."
1,"DISAPPOINTING, LIMITED SUPPORT ON XP","Of the titles, only the airport title works well. The farm title cannot size up higher than 640 and functions poorly. Mouse overs and clicks have high latency. The School title is just weak. It also suffers from screen fragments under XP."
1,Fisher Price: Little People Discovery Games 3 Disk Compilati,"Only the 1st disc works if you have Windows XP,even though the box states it works with XP.My 3 year old daughter was very disappointed after seeing the box."
5,My kids enjoy this game!,My kids enjoy this game. We have had/are having positive experiences purchasing a variety of products from Amazon and it's sellers.
5,Two Thumbs Up!,"An amazing game! I liked it a lot. Its sorta like Battlefield Vietnam but with a campaign. The campaign wasn't much just some EASY missions. The Instant action was very enjoyable, cool locations like Kamino,Mos Eisley, and Rhen Var. Overall good game."
2,it aight,"well, i bought this game because of the 4.5/5 average rating from 100 reviews. i totally dont get it. multi player has one thing, ctf. what is that. multi player is the only part of this game that is even close to good. the single player sucks. the AI is not smart at all."
3,be careful,"pay no attention to my rating, just the review part. i have no idea whether this game is fun or not, although the commercials make it look like you're fighting in every great scene from all the movies....but BE CAREFUL when you buy the PC version. it requires a very high quality graphics card. and once you open the box and try to install it and it won't open cause yours isn't good enough, you're screwed cause you can't return it. i didn't feel like spending $100 to upgrade my computer for one game.even though this game is marketed like a dream-come-true for fans, just make sure your computer can handle this game or it's $50 down the sink."
3,Great is an over statement,"When i heard that finally they are making a good Starwars game i jumped right over to my local gameing store to pick out a cope. The game wasn't what i exspected, but it was good. The graphics are very good with stuning people desines, but the gun details need a little work.The guns are preety much all the same just with a diferent look to them which makes it kind of cheeseThe bad part of this game is that there is no story plot. yah you can play in all of the starwars trilage battles, but it's just how many people you can kill before you or the computer runs out of people. On the other hand you can play as the rebels, empire and even people in the clone wars(cis and rebublic). You can jump into a star fighter or a tie fighter. In Hoth and in Renvar you can get into a at-at. In certain levels you can get into a at-st. The sound efects are preety good and I like that your able to comand people on your team."
5,Star wars Battlefront,This is what could be one of the most fun games ever you can fight in combat in all 6 episodes and you can pilot more than 15 different craft in cluding the Atat which is cool cause no other game will let you pilon an Atat .
3,MMMMM i was expecting something better....,"I really was expecting something really really really better than this , but its ok except for the multiplayer , it lags a lot and radar doesnt works very good. But it isnt soo bad only for the price. BYE"
2,SAVE YOUR $$$$$$,I played this game at my friends house and I thought that it was pretty boreing. First of all the game play isn't good at all . I thought the graphics were good. The game play is like Socom but set in the future. The should have a couple more and better weapons. The rounds are stupid because when your the last one alive on your team you lose which is stupid because your still alive against say two more droids and you lose. I was going to buy it at first but when I played it at my friends house I thought h*** no.But thats my opinion for this game. If you like it thats fine
2,Worst game,"This game was a let down. At first it was kinda cool, because of the characters I remembered as a child. But after 30 minutes that wore off, and it wasn't even close to BF1942. They did nothing to expand on the gameplay.The weapons have no feel of power, just blah... I didn't have high hopes, I was expecting a game to be at least as good as BF1942 or Call of Duty, but it didn't come close."
2,A Kid's BF1942,"This game is kind of confusing to me. In some ways it appears to be a very dumbed down bf1942 with a Star Wars'y thing going on.But at the same time, some of the complexity of the character classes adds an element that is more tactical than bf1942. (The pilot class for instance)The multiplayer browser absolutely sucks.The graphics....if your playing on the PC, it's obvious this is a console port.I played it pretty hard for about a week or two, and then went back to BF vietnam.If you have the $40 to spare for a cheap thrill for a week or so, I say go for it. However, if your gaming budget is tight, I recommend the UT2004's, or the Battlefield series over this. They offer much more replayablility, and have massive mod support, which I doubt this game will ever have."
3,Fun..... just fun,"Not caring at all about graphics, this game is very good, and puts a Star Wars label on the new brand of Checkpoint-nabbing shooter war games like Battlefield 1942, Vietnam, etc. Except there is only one basic weapon and pistol and secondary... no dropping weapons and picking up new ones.The game is fun and addicting but gets boring. The campaigns aren't any different from the actual game at all. A big problem is that the maps are too small for aircraft to enjoy the joy of flight. To be effective with shooting, you have to constantly be braking just to hit more things on the ground.All in all, fun, but quickly boring. Not really worth buying now, wait till it's 10$ or borrow from a friend"
1,Wow..would be fun if amazon ever shipped me the game.,Hmm ordered it a week ago and they (AMAZON) still haven't shipped it... Hopefully the reason is that they are going to send me a version that works..read online many of the cds are bad... anyhow..if the game is anything like 1942 i'll be happy..however hearing it locks to 20fps on online sounds scary.. oh well... maybe by xmas this will finally ship!
1,Hello,"Readers should be aware, the game hasn't come out and already its getting 5 stars. They will probly slap a $15-20 dollar monthly charge. Wait till the game comes out then trust reviews."
2,Very Disappointed,"As said several times before, this game is weak. The ONLY thing going for it is the Star Wars theme. There's no real strategy and the classes are poorly balanced. What's more, the air vehicles have a terrible control interface. For real multiplayer FPS action, go with UTK2004. It has a ton of game types, much better graphics, much better mfr support and a huge fan base and community support. Get UTK2004 and the Star Wars mod from fileplanet.Furthermore, the installer is buggy (documented on their web site). This product clearly missed the quality assurance cycle.Star Wars Battelfront blows and I'm sorry I paid the $$ for it."
3,"Fun, but load times are slow","I did not know what to expect when I decided to get this game. I had not read any reviews and just thought it sounded kind of fun.The game itself is fun. Controls are easy to use, graphics are good and my machine setup allows me to run at higher resolution/settings without any issues. I would agree with other people that I would have like some type of storyline or such to work with -- I think it would make the overall gaming experience a bit better.My one big complaint with the game is the load times. It is terrible. As you move from one campaign to another, the load time is about 60 seconds. This seems like an eternity to sit and watch a the spining ""loading"" graphic. At first I thought I might have change the graphic settings to be to high, so I kicked them down several notches, but still the same slow load times. This is driving me nuts -- at least in KOTOR the load times were only a few seconds. I could even live with 15-20 seconds, 60 seconds -- that is terrible."
2,Beta at best,"This looks to be a cool game. Unfortunately, the release was so dependant in corresponding with the DVD trilogy release that Lucas Arts has released a Beta version of a game. The game plays okay, but the controls are bad compared to BF1942 or BFV.Even worse, the consoles are weak at best. The multiplayer consoles are the weakest since the original Doom."
5,Very well done!,"Last Christmas, I got Star wars Battlefront. Sadly my computer was not good enough for the grapics card requirements WARNING: IF YOU BUY THIS GAME MAKE SURE YOUR COMPUTER WORKS WITH IT. It drove me insane. Finally a couple montha later, I finally got the graphics card. It is a very well done game. It has 20 standard star wars troops (including wookies, and destroyer droids, and clone troopers with jetpacks) from the (new and old movies) and has many playing maps.Pros: It has wonderful graphicsYour troops never do the same thing twiceYou can list commands to nearby troopsYou can be a wookie :)Cons: You can't pick up dropped weaponsThe campaigns aren't much different from the instant combatmaps"
5,Brilliant,"If you like star wars and dont like this game, something is wrong with you. This is a good game, unlike most of the other star wars games (clone wars, republic commando, star wars episode one the game, star wars revenge of the sith game, star wars bounty hunter, etc.) it is so fun, i have it for xbox. the droids are cool, and whats even cooler is that you can play as droideka (the cool droids that roll into a ball and have a shield) and a clone with a jetpack (which i dont remember from star wars) a stormtrooper a dark trooper (stormtrooper w/ jetpack, again i dont remember from star wars) and a rebel trooper. brilliant, cant wait for battle front 2!"
2,Over-rated,"This is a pure melee game. It's unco-ordinated, plotless and the movements/controls are out of date compared to other FPS's. If you're looking for all out shooting, without much teamplay or strategy then try Unreal Tournament.For those looking for a Battlefield 1942/Vietnam type game set in the Star Wars Universe, get set to be dissapointed.Just not very playable or much fun at all once you've seen all the maps and the characters.Get it used!"
4,Star Wars Battlefront a hit,"Although it's a shoot-em up game, it's a lot of fun for my 8 year old son. I'd rate it 5 if it was more educational. Graphics are good, and there's enough diversity in the play to keep it interesting. We have not used the multiplayer gaming."
2,Patch me please!!!,this game makes you appreciate the work that went into bf1942. The maps are terrible and the game is clunky. Its fun to run around as a stormtrooper but that wears off pretty darm quick. They need to fix the multiplayer interface and add new maps soon.
3,A disapointing letdown,"While mowing down hundreds of enemies can certainly be fun, my mouth was hanging open when I realized that was ALL THIS GAME IS. There is no storyline, you don't even get a character you play as. It's simply mindless shooting. It's billed as strategy, but it's not that either. You can command a small squad to go with you, but it's essentially just a lot of chaos.I am giving it a generous rating because it is well made and the battles are amusing. But I HIGHLY recomend you wait until this one hits the bargain bins. I am still regretting the $50 I had to pay for this game. Mindless shooting is just not worth that kind of money!"
1,Rushed,"If this game had come out 5 years ago it would have been considered good, apart from the horrible settings editor and server browser.However battlefield 1942 came out two years ago and is still the far better game.If you are a star wars nerd buy it, otherwise don't."
4,An indispensible volume,"This is the only edition of Gwendolyn Brooks's poems that is complete until the mid-1980s. Brooks is one of the most important American poets of the 20th century, and there is much to be learned by following her career in detail, from one volume to the next. She published the volume with Third world Press to give a black-owned publishing house the business--a typical choice for Brooks, who throughout her career has supported African American arts publishing, nurtured younger black writers, and made choices about how to invest her energies as a poet that are both politically savvy and humane. There are, in short, many good reasons to buy this book."
5,Good mission motivator,"This movie is very good. It is funny, sad, entertaining, and easy to relate to. It would be a good inspirational movie to watch if considering going on a mission. One of my favorite LDS movies (and I have seen/own quite a few)."
1,Way too much whining!,"This movie, in my experience does not accurately depict Mormon missionaries. I have never seen so many whiney children."
1,Zarahemla ending.,"I am one that writes the ""anti"" literature and unfortunately they got the facts confused about Joseph Smith's initial revelation. There were 3 conflicting reports and not 4 like Dutcher proclaims in this film.Why did you not tell people the importance of following your feelings and not the facts?We just got done watching the Director's Commentary with a former 6th generation Mormon. Unfortunately, this movie is just another attempt to expand on the lies that the LDS church has proclaimed over the past 170 years.The only way for a Mormon to achieve a heavenly reward, is to risk walking into what Mormons call ""outer darkness"" by trusting the facts of Christ Jesus and not your feelings.If you are a Mormon wanting to know the truth about the real Christ Jesus, please look up Saints Alive on the web."
4,Worth watching!,"My non-mormon friend enjoyed this film as much as my family and I did. It is touching and funny and not ""preachy"". Just normal, flawed human beings with spiritual growing pains--not theory or theology. Worth watching!"
4,Great Pulp,"Writing my bachelor's thesis on lesbian pulp. Best book of the ones I've read, a believable story as well as lesbian sex scenes^^"
3,it lacks,"I bought this book for a through practice and am somewhat disappointed. Math concepts review is far from through, many word problems are written ambiguously, practice sets are not very diverse. Combinations, permutations and even elementary stat problems are completely absent. I would recommend this book for practice with some reservation."
2,poor thing ;(((,"this one is not very useful. bad structure, short list of examples, etc. save your money and don't purchase this item."
5,"very descriptive, with different kinds of problems","I thought this book was really good to prepare me for GRE math, as it covered a lot of different types of questions. It went through each types of math questions and had these drills which helped me. I highly recommend this book."
2,doesn't cover quiet a few concepts,"I am pretty good at math. I solved each and every question in this book. When I gave the GMAT, I was faced with problems like factorials, permutation/combination, probability, compound interest, median/mode and quiet a few others which this book did not talk about.If you looking for better then average score this book is good, but if you are looking to absolutely crack GMAT math, this book SUCKS."
4,Great for learning to play simple songs,"I am an adult trying to learn Piano. This program is great for learning simple songs and does have a very good feedback system.The lessons are taught with plenty of simple songs which you can play and the feedback system will track how well you play. The feedback system tracks your key presses, rythem, and note length. However, it does not track the strength of your key press.I would like to see more exercises to develop better basic skills, instead of just playing simple songs. Also, the feedback program can be very discouraging for children as it is very sensitive and report very minor error.Overall, this is still a great program to have for self learner, but in no way will it beat a real piano teacher."
3,"Okay, I guess","This program is okay, if you are motivated enough. The lessons are pretty easy to follow although the female instructor is pretty annoying, especially when she sings along to the songs. I bought a MIDI cable that did not work very well with the program. I kept getting errors when I would have my performance reviewed. It could have just been my computer, but it got pretty frustrating. I now have a basic knowledge of how to play technically, but I wish there were exercises on how to strengthen your fingers so that they actually hit the right keys."
2,Did not meet my expectations!,"From all the reviews and the product descriptions posted, I was disappointed with the product. I bought this to motivate my 7yr old and to suppliment his formal lessons. The multimedia/video button crashes the program every time - the web site lists getting the latest edition of quicktime - not effective. UnlikeMusic Ace Deluxethe keyboard input is delayed by 1/2 a second - support recommends buying a new sound card with low latency.Don't recommend this for youngsters, adults can get still get use out of this program by ignoring the lagging keyboard input and not touching the multimedia/video button. I have the guitar version and was very happy with it; the same can't be said for this Emedia product."
1,Disappointing - Returned It,"The program crashed everytime I tried to play the videos. I upgraded QuickTime per their web site's suggestion and that didn't help either. The program is made for low resolution monitors and while you can switch to full screen mode, it just changes your Windows resolution to a very low setting so it fills up the screen.I didn't even get to the second screen in the introduction. Maybe you'll have more luck on a Mac, but I wouldn't suggest this program for anyone running on a new Windows based PC."
1,Wrong CD in the Box TWICE,"I ordered this software, but when it arrived, the box contained the CD for eMedia's Guitar Method. I went through the replacement process, but the second box also contained the same wrong CD. Finally just went to Guitar Center and bought it -- software works well on the Mac."
5,The best neo- progressive band of the century LIVE,"The track listing for disc 1 is: Karelia, The Old Man & The Sea, Harvest, Slow Fire, Thoughts in Absence, Road to Nowhere, Book of Hours, The Flow. Disc 2: Groundbound, Where Solitude Remains, Wheel, Tabatah, Nucleus, Rubankh parts 1 & 2. Sound is audiophile quality, and some of the tracks that came across as a little bit stiff or stodgy on the first three studio albums receive fluid, incredibly energized performances. As with the albums, vocals are the weak point. Highly recommended to fans of '70s King Crimson."
5,Superb Deck Screw,"I know a lot about building decks and deck screws. When the directions on the box and on the inside flaps are followed these screws are unmatched. This bucket contains 1750 screws or enough for 500 sq ft if your joists are 16"" apart. FastenMaster's Guarantee of Performance is comprensive and has no fine print. These are not for applications near the ocean. For use only in composite (plastic-wood fiber) or PVC decking."
3,Disappointed!!!,"Not necessarily disappointed in the product itself. Very irritated that the procduct info is incorrect! First line states Manufuctured in Italy, but product packaging states MADE IN CHINA!!! Italian design! Not at all happy about this. I feel deceived. Probably would not have purchased this if given correct info. Got free shipping, but would have to pay to send it back even though I was not properly informed about the product! :("
3,SEE DEBBIE HARRY circa 1976!!,"Okay, this is a little amateurish and slow, but where else can you see gorgeous Deborah Harry circa 1976; filmed before Blondie's first album was even in stores? Unfortunately, she's not the star of the film, and director Amos poe doesn't give her much to do in her one scene where she has 6 or 7 lines of dialogue before launching into an a capella number called ""Sweet Thing"". Then she's gone, and you press STOP on your DVD player! I can't say the rest of the movie is bad because I never get past Debbie! Amos also made three other films at around the same time, THE FOREIGNER (also with Debbie in a small singing cameo), BLANK GENERATION (documenting 1976-era CBGBs also including a section on Blondie), and NITE LUNCH, another docu-style account of the early scene circa 1975 with short clip of the Blondies. I recommend all of them for Blondie collectors and affecianados of the NYC punk era."
3,Pedrini Black & Satin Apple Corer - Blah...,"I had high hopes of this working well. It did its job of coring an apple, but I would have to say, at best, it did the job minimally.I think it had to do with the fact that the front end (that you insert into the apple) isn't sharp enough. Even though the big rubber handle afforded a comfortable grip, I still needed to push VERY hard to insert the corer. Only after many twists and turns (literally), the apple core came out with the corer. I also had to use a fork to dislodge the core from the corer.I suspect my twisting and turning will eventually break the handle from the steel body.Not the best (I've used another and it was much better), but it does the job so-so.BTW, is it common for the area that we core to turn brown almost immediately? I didn't notice that happening with the other better corer."
5,Great to have...,"Everything came perfectly, I highly recommend this Apple Corer it leave your apple with out the seeds and you can eat all from anywhere without worries where to throw the seeds or what you left from the apple... Buy it!! Good price, well made..."
3,Didn't blow me away but also didn't bore me,"Apparently Angel Dust had an earlier incarnation as a thrash metal band but I never heard that version. This CD is more along the lines of progressive metal or some call it power metal although it does have vestiges of thrash in it. Of Human Bondage has some good riffs played with the standard chunky metal style. I like the singer's voice in concert with the music, they go together well and I agree with another reviewer that the vocals should have been elevated in the mix. His voice gets lost sometimes. I could have done without the synthesizer though. With these songs it seemed to take the edge off. There are a few good, dark tunes that end up fluffy around the edges because of the synth. The strongest songs for me are Of Human Bondage, Got This Evil and Unreal Soul. Overall, Of Human Bondage is a decent prog metal CD. It didn't blow me away but it also didn't bore me."
3,Not up to the expectation,"Man... like the others, I was so looking forward to this album. But it turned out... this wasn't something I expected... The feelings and emotions of the previous albums are lost. I used to regard AD as THE band I love. Their last album, ""Enlighten the Darkness"" is simply one of the BEST metal albums out there IMO. Anywayz, back to this album... riffs got somewhat heavier, but not nearly as beautiful. The chorus melodies are nicely done although the verse melodies tend to be poor... Too much ""techno"" or whatever effect were added using their keyboard in this album... They should retain some of those ""piano melodies"" they used to have. Guitar solos tend to be repetitive and not as ""tasty"" as the ones in the earlier albums.Sorry man... I just can't give this album a high rating, coz I was certainly disappointed this time. ..."
3,"I cry, I weep, but I still listen.","Definitely not their best, check out Bleed and Enlighten the Darkness if you want to here this band in all their glory. That said, I still listen to it. It isn't a terrible album, the production quality, and the catchiness of some of the songs save it. ""The Human Bondage"" is a fairly decent song, and ""Got This Evil"", and ""Cultman"" are fun to listen to, but the album as a whole doesn't do for me what their earlier efforts did. Worth a listen, just check out the older stuff first!"
3,great rock-n-roll!!!,"I have not received this item as of yet.From what I remember this was an excellent hard rock album(cd, oops!)"
4,Dangerous Toys = Good CD,"Dangerous Toys: Hellacious Acres is a very good CD. I recommend this CD to only those who r truely HEAVEY METAL FANS. This CD rocks. I give it a 4 out of 5, its good, but not great."
1,Aside from the first track....,"...this album stinks. I bought it while working in the USA and the first track (Gunfighter) was sharp, catchy, and typical 80's metal. Great! Then I had the misfortune of listening to the rest of the material on the album. Sadly, this ends up being like much of Slaughter's work - characterized by poor songwriting and even poorer guitar playing. Many of the earlier bands do this kind of thing justice. Don't waste your money on this, but instead go out and buy any album by Axel Rudi Pell, or anything pre-1990 by Y & T. Much better."
4,Extremely Satasfied,"After purchasing their debut album the first time I saw the video for ""Teasin' Pleasin'"" way back in 1989, I became a Dangerous Toys fan for life. Yeah I'm 29, but I still rock. Hellacious Acres would top that release hands down. Gunfighter,the best song of their career, Sticks and Stones, On Top, and Bad Guy, show Dangerous Toys at their rocking best. Best of Friends is a great ballad that really tugs at your heart strings being that it is about the death of a friend of the band. The only two throw aways on this album are Gimme No Lip and Angel N U. And the band does a decent cover of Bad Company's Feel Like Making Love. Buy this album. You won't be sorry."
5,Works Great,"I use this with my TM506 and it works just fine, And at its price its a very very good product.. Its been more than 6 months and no issues till date"
3,tm506 travel charger,I just wanted to let other customers know that mine lasted 5 months. I am ordering another one as it is still WAYYYY cheaper than the ones sold at stores. The one I bought at Tmobile lasted less than a year and it was $35. Maybe unplugging it from cigarette lighter would help but I don't know for sure.
2,price not worth 10 minutes,"When I purchased this video I also purchased a couple of other 20/20 videos. I though that, at least this would be around 30 minutes. There was no time length identified. So imagine my surprise when I found out the video was all of ten minutes and no more. I paid $15 for 10 minutes of video? I think that this was misrepresented by Amazon by NOT listing the length. I intend to contact Amazon.com about this. I would not waste my money on this."
2,Poor presentation,"Graphics are poor. The smallish size coupled with poor contrast make this Kindle edition very difficult to read. This was not evident from the sample provided by Amazon. This technology needs much improvement, to include better contrast, improved resolution and an ability to zoom in on illustrations and pictures."
5,Works great and love the price!,"I know it's just a bulb, but it's great when you purchase something and it actually works. Furthermore, what I paid on Amazon was half the price of Lowes or Home Depot. For this type of thing, Amazon rocks!"
3,If You Lived Here,"I enjoyed this book, told in the narratives of two friends. It was sad and sweet and worth a read."
5,Engrossing.,"I loved this book. The story is told by the two different women who each voice every other chapter. I was suprised by how this story took me right in and how much I learned about Vietnam. The writing is so descriptive and the story so beautifully written, I felt like I was there."
4,"I liked "" If You Lived Here"" very much!","This book showed a lot about the Vietnamese culture and revealed the development of a wonderful friendship between a Caucasian American woman and an initially emotionally withdrawn Vietnamese woman. Because of acomplicated adoption of a Vietnamese child, the two women bonded, eventually becoming good friends. I was very engrossed in this story, and it had a ring of truth about it, probably because the author, Dana Sachs, has spent a great deal of time in Vietnam and got to know its culture well. Heather R."
2,An okay book.,Kept my interest at first but am to the middle now and have a hard time continuing to read the story. Maybe it will get better again. Will finish it but probably not recommend it.
5,I loved this book,"This story swept me up in the first few pages, and took me all the way to the end. The characters are enganging and the prose is beautiful. Two women are on a trek - a Vietnamese woman toward a past that shames her, and an American woman toward a child she hopes to adopt. I don't want to spoil the end for you."
3,Interesting. But started to drag towards the end.,"There are two separate plots at the same time. One starts to drag as the story moves along. All in all, not a bad read but could have come to a conclusion quicker."
4,Nice read,A simple easy read. I like the style that each chapter us told from the perspective of one of the two main characters. Believable and enjoyable.
2,Story lacked realism,"I could have enjoyed the book if it had been less predictable and more believable. Like most mediocre fiction, it just didn't hold my interest."
1,Not what I had hoped,"I had a device similar to this that was lost in a move and hoped that the Pedrini Two-Prong Corkpuller would be its replacement. Alas, this was not to be. . . this is in inferior product that easily destroys corks. The tongs do not easily slide along the sides of the cork and break off small chunks of cork as it goes in.I do not recommend it."
1,Did not like!,My friend has a wine opener that she got at a spring show. I thought this was just like it but the prongs are thicker and curved on the end. Hers is very thin without the curve and works awesome. This one does not! I push the cork in every time. Would not recommend.
1,Not a good product,"I've been using two-prong pullers for more than 10 years, so I'd like to think I have a fairly decent ability to use them. I ignored other reviews of this product stating it's poor functionality, thinking it was possible that people might be using it incorrectly.Well, I can say definitively that the puller I received is not like others I have used. I continue to get damaged corks, and I struggle to have a clean pull on any bottle I open. I'm not sure what part of the design causes such poor performance, but I would strongly recommend looking for an alternate 2-prong puller."
2,Kind of an oddball corkpuller,"I keep one of these around to use on damaged or brittle corks that I think a corkscrew will destroy. You slip the long end down one side of the cork and wiggle it back-and-forth until the other end slips down too. The wiggling forces it all the way down over the cork, and you then pull the cork by twisting up and pulling slowly.Broken corks do tend to get shoved down in the bottle with this, but it works like a charm on synthetic corks."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"This radio does everything it says it will, and it does it quite well.My siblings and I bought this for our parents, who also live in Oklahoma, and they have been very enthused by it. My 77-year-old father actually listens to regular radio with it, and has tinkered with the shortwave.The sound is very good, and it is easy to operate, even for my extremely non-technical Dad. He did get tired of winding it, and this leads to my only gripe: CCrane need to include an AC adapter. The dynamo is nice, but the novelty wears off quickly. (We bought an adapter from Radio Shak, and it has worked fine.)"
1,Do Not Buy Freeplay Products,"I purchased a freeplay flashlight, and when I really needed it, it would not work. The company acknowledged the fatal flaw in the design but would do nothing for me. The rating system does'nt allow zero stars, but these guys deserve minus stars."" Not only is the spring prone to the problem you've come up against, its coiled energy (even when ""unwound"" it is still partly coiled) makes it dangerous to open the case, so repair is difficult and replacement is the only practical option in such a situation.""They said that I should buy a new one, you've got to be kidding me!"
1,One year later...nada,"About a year after acquiring a Freeplay Plus we finally had a power failure long enough and at night, so that I wanted to use the radio and flashlight. Neither worked, despite many rounds of cranking.After the power returned, I plugged it into the AC charger and got the radio to work, but the flashlight is plumb dead.This was a total waste of money for me."
3,A Radio with problems,"This radio was advertised as the FreePlay Plus, it was just a Freeplay. The radio works, The solar panel works the best, the gears break on the wind up part but can be repaired. This model has no Nicad batteries built into it so you can't charge it in the Sun during the day. Get the FreePlay Plus and not just the Freeplay, it has Nicad batteries built-in."
2,half an album,"Only about half this album is of interest, with a lot of filler. The songwriting shows promise, but the ideas aren't well-developed, and several of the songs are allowed to go on and on, far past the point where they were interesting."
4,TH's Amberry Thong - I Love It!,"I have worn these shoes a couple of times and I love them! They are absolutely adorable (in fact, I'm thinking about ordering a pair in white also, and possibly chocolate). The fuschia pair goes really well with a pink tank top and black skirt I have from Old Navy, and they also look cute with jeans. Only 1 small thing, and I hope it goes away after I've worn them a couple more times, is that the thong tends to pinch between my toes just a little bit every now and then. It doesn't really hurt, and it doesn't rub, it's just a little bit aggravating when it happens. If it hurt, I wouldn't continue wearing them, but it doesn't, and these are some of my favorite sandals ever!"
2,Has some spots on it.,And its kind of flimsy. If I didnt need it for my son's Bot Scout project I wouyld have sent it back.
4,The nagging question,I too read Firebrats when I was in highschool. I only read the first one and because I turned the book in late to the library I never went back because I didn't want to pay the fee...don't tell:) Unfortunately what I created was this nagging question of what happened!!! I am now 25 and I am trying to find the complete set so that I can finally see what happened to the two lead characters. One book and i was hooked.
4,Great Coat,Great looking coat. Nice lining on inside of coat. The only negative for this coat is that it is made in China.
5,Great Wifi Solution for your PDA,"I have this on my ipaq 1935, unlike the other reviews i do not notice any ""looseness"" in the fit of the card in my SDIO slot, I rarely have any disconnects, and overall this has been a great solution for a mobile computing platform. Although being small it boasts great power and coverage, and has been absolutely reliable. I have noticed a small amount of battery drainage, but nothing overwhelming. I would reccomend this product to anyone looking to get their SDIO enabled pda online."
4,"Works, pretty neat",Definitely a must have for your handheld. My iPaq is from 2003. It was nice to be able to begin to use it to it's fullest potential.
1,The card will drain your battery,I have been using this card with my Viewsonic V37.Pros: Speed: 470Mbits/s (128bit encryption)Cons: If the card is inside it will drain your battery.Occasionally I have to cycle the power of the unit in order for the card to reset.Installation and connection to the network is very easy. Excellent performance.
3,Good for a trial run,"This product is good for a beginner who is looking to practice with fondant. It does not cover a large area and dries out rather quickly. For ease of use it does what is intended. I would recommend for a one time cake project but if you are going to bake more than one, I would make my own."
4,its okay?,"am i not following the direction correctly or something? it doesn't work for me, ive been taking this for almost a week now, i dont feel any difference."
1,Great Kung Fu-bad reproduction,"This is a great Kung Fu movie that I have owned for years on VHS. When it came out on DVD, I was quick to pick up a copy. I definitely should have waited. The reproduction of this movie is almost unwatchable. Red shadows litter the movie and blur many details in the movie. As a matter of fact this DVD looks like it was copied from a poor VHS using crappy duplication equipment. The infamous rising line that comes from poor VHS duplication is present in this edition. Bottom Line-Movie = 5 stars and quality of reproduction = unwatchable."
2,Snake in the Monkeys Shadow,Great MovieHorrible copy.This was not remastered. I have this as a 20 year old video tape.My old tape is better than this dvd copy.
1,Serial Transfer Cable,The setup directions provided on a disk that came with the product were not at all clear. I was unable to make the cable work correctly.
2,File transfers,"Maybe it's just me, but I bought this cable to transfer old files from my old computer on to my new computer and it totally did not work. I used the transfer and settings wizard in windows xp (the same on both computers) and neither computer recognized the ports. I tried several times, did the disk, did the usb transfer for the wizard, nothing!"
2,Not what I was hoping for,"I got the camera, opened it, loaded the film, took 3 photos, and the pull cord almost broke (like I read about in a previous review), so be VERY careful with the cord. So I took 20 photos on the 24 exposure roll of film, and the cord would pull no more, so I figured ""whatever"", and rolled the film and took them in to get them developed, of all 20 photos, one of them turned out, the rest are all almost pitch black. I don't really see any point for anyone to buy this camera."
5,Love it,"Had 800 speed film that came with it. Very cool but it's lomography so every shoot doesn't come out perfect. It's a novelty and it's not - it makes art. It is good for action shoots and equal for still's. One check out the website before buying. www.lomography.com and my website for pics I took with my supersampler. www.geocities.com/anthonylitzBTW - I have only shot a few rools with mine but when I shoot some 100 speed I relized that the manufactured recommened HIGH LIGHT is a MUST. I did all my shots outside, but in shadows or not under the direct sun shoots were very dark! Right now I have 400 black and white in my super sampler....check my website one day they will be on there!"
2,cool concept; terrible quality,This camera was really fun to play with for about two weeks. I managed to shoot two and a half rolls of film before the pulley mechanism broke. I love the concept of four shutters firing off sequentially. I just wish this camera was built with a little more quality.
2,when it works it works great... but the ripcord is an inconvenient novelty,"the ripcord on mine broke after about 3 rolls of film. i was able to modify the camera to incorporate a film advance wheel. after modifying it, it worked great, and continues to work great almost 10 years later.i find the lenses on this camera to be superior to the ActionSampler. i'd recommend the SuperSampler over the ActionSampler even with the ripcord issues."
2,This hat is NOT Royal Blue.,"I hoped to give my friend two different shades of blue beanies for Christmas. Unfortunately, he ended up receiving two ""Sky Blue"" beanies in slightly different shades."
1,not very helpful,Purchased this product for back pain and used it often after recieving it but it didn't do as good a job at relieving pain as products I had already been using.
2,Air compressor,The product came in damaged. I emailed several time and after several attempts I did get one back telling me to resend the package and only had a few days to do it. I did need this item and while waiting for a response I went to the local Target and purchased another. So I still have the broken here.
4,Behind the tatemae,"I read this book shortly after the publication in 1997 and now again in June 2000. It is surprising how accurate Jon Woronoff's predictions of the ongoing societal and economic crises of Japan have been. The book was written before the consumption tax hike and the unfolding banking crises, and yet it catches the sentiments of present day Japan. I hope that Jon Woronoff will soon update his book with the latest twists of political disarray, runaway construction projects paving the country side, and the declining competitiveness of key sectors in the economy."
5,A great outlook of Japanese society right now,"Jon Woronoff, in his book The Japanese Social crisis, sumarizes what is happening now with the Japanese society. He writes an antithesis of one book from Ezra Vogel and Richard Lynn's ""The Japanese education system"". PResents a great outlook about family relationships, education, job, tatemae and an anthropological view of the society."
3,"Cables are very heavy duty, too stiff for my liking but made well.","These rca cables are well made and don't seem cheap to me. However I do feel like they are very stiff and personally I like cables to have a more supple feel to them.Perform as advertised, nothing more to say really. Weird color, the grey and orange but I like it."
4,wonderful!,"i picked this up at a consignment sale, but would pay full price for it! my only complaint is that there isn't a way to change the batteries in it without taking lamb chop apart somehow(as in ripping the stitches out). other than that, it's a wonderful toy! i wish there was more lamb chop stuff out there! i bought this for our soon to be born daughter, but my son decided that it was his toy lol. great for all kids!"
3,This one is a puppet!!,"I was a bit disappointed as the description did not state that this was as puppet. I thought it was going to be the plush toy with sound as I already have one and was looking for a replacement. The arm in the picture isnt just holding up the toy, its inside it as the puppeteer. Otherwise, Lambchop is cute and says 10 phrases, same as the plush toy!! Any child would love it!!"
4,Very Sweet,We are happy with this puppet of Lamb Chop and the voice is very quiet for a child to listen to and talk softly. We will be giving this to our first grandchild for Chirstmas. It is a nice size for a child to hold and hug.
1,"do yourself a favor, don't buy this camera!","I owned a Canon A60 for a number of years, which I loved. However last year I decided that I would like to upgrade to a sleeker, lighter camera with a larger screen, and more megapixels and decided on the F460. What a mistake! Although this camera has all of these attributes, it takes terrible pictures. Unless I am in the absolute brightest light my pictures are consistently out of focus... which completely negates the point of having a higher resolution camera. If you are shopping for a digital camera, get something that has the software to compensate for vibrations or movements while you are taking a picture. Otherwise everything will be out of focus (I guess unless you cart around a tri-pod, which also defeats the purpose of buying a light-weight camera.Less than a year after purchasing this camera I am shopping for a new digital camera."
3,Mixed emotions.....,"This version is deficient of many important abilities that decent video would need in the same way as FC 2 suite is packed with some programs and utilities majority of video don't need at all. Unfortunately there's no normality, no firm middle ground. I think Apple has to determine who is dedicated audience for the product."
2,viewer shade,"Buyers beware. I need a great shade for my D 80. I am a professional and live in the desert. As most of us know, shade is at a premium. I could not see my viewer well enough and needed a shade for it. At first glance, this seemed like the awesome choice. Wrong...it lasted about a year and broke. I still do not have a shade on my camera and still use my hand like I have done for years to shade my eyes. I guess until someone comes up with a better idea, my hand will do the trick and not this snap on pro shade that will not cut the mustard. Guaranteed to break for you if you buy like I did. I gave it two stars for I had cooled off for a while after it broke before I published this review."
3,"Good in concept, could be designed better","It sure does its job, and can easily stop you from rapidly checking the photo as soon as you take it, (chimping, as they call it) but it does, unfortunately, make it harder to access the side buttons and the 4-directional wheel."
3,Lighted dial??,"Used it for about six hours when the illuminated dial burned out. I had a choice of sending it back or going to the ""HUT"" to get a replacement bulb and installing it myself. I think I'll send it back and try another. It IS a nice little radio otherwise. BLUpdate: Bought another and it arrived DOA. No power, no sound, zilch. Glad I didn't give it as a gift. I think I'll give up and go elsewhere. BL"
2,Looks good .,The radio looks good but it's performance is poor. Sound quality is poor and sounds muffled. Turner is unable to pinpoint stations and it's common to receive two stations at once. Adding a long wire to FM antenna does little to improve reception. This is the first and last Crosley radio for me!!!!!!!!!
5,Good Old Days,"I listen to the oldies stations and now the radio fits the tunes. High quality radio, beautifully made. I've receeived many nice comments on it."
5,Great Little radio,"I was looking for a radio that would just have the AM/FM capability. I already had the electronics for everything else, so this radio fit the bill. It was just what I wanted. The retro cabinet fits my decor. I would recommend this product to anyone who just wants a simple radio."
5,Nicely made,I love how the wood-framed radio is made to look as original/old-style without looking cheap or made with poor-quality. The lighted up station dial when it's on also adds to the look of the radio.
3,Overall Just OK.,"The electronics are encased in a nice, nostalgic wood veneer which gives the radio an appealing vintage look. It is a simple radio with no tone control and just the usual fare of on/off/volume, a selector switch for AM/FM, and a tuning dial. Nice touch is that the dial is lit, but the window itself is cramped and the AM frequencies are rather hard to see. The radio has a built-in wire FM antenna. Overall the build quality appears very adequate and substantial.I really don't like the sound quality. To me, voice sounds a bit more muffled than other radios I have used. Selectivity is fair; rejection of adjoining signals is rather good, and reception is also fair. Knobs are rather stiff but the radio is fairly new and will loosen over time.Radio is just a normal everyday kind of radio in a nice cabinet. For a bit more money, the Sangean or Crane radios offer more bang-for-the-buck."
5,"Truly A Good Looking ""Companion""","I have been searching for this walnut version of the Crosley Radio Companion for over a year -- When I received mine several weeks ago, I was totally thrilled. Not only does it have a really retro look but the dial lights up and the sound quality is of yesteryear, which makes it all the more charming. So if you are lucky to get one, go for it; you will really be pleased."
3,Less than hoped for,"This radio looks good, tunes in local stations fine, but does not have the ""sound of wood"" that I had hoped it would. The sound is comparable to the standard plastic clock radio. Its ok for the garage/shop."
3,It is OK I guess,"It is challenging in parts, but just a bit too mechanical, and I want more story. Other games were move riveting and make you feel you have to play until the end, you always want to see what happens next. This Game however turns out to be more of a chore, first navigate this room, then the next room, then the next zzzzz.. On the plus side.. the graphics look good.."
5,Awsome Game,"This game has an awsome plot that is full of surprises. It won't be able to guess what is coming (unless you already found out from some where else). This game has good graphics, and good gameplay. It's combat design is excelent, and the level designs are really good. The controls (like any game) take some time to get used to, but if you are a compitent learner, by mid-game (at the latest) the controls will feel as natural as walking. I especially like the game concept. I'm going to go now, so I can buy the next one (Prince of Persia: Warrior Within) and pre-order Prince of Persia 3.PS- You will love the ending."
2,Bargain bin fodder,"To summarize.....If you want to play a game where it is close to impossible to control the protagonist, solve puzzles that doesnt make any sense at all to the overall story, climb walls while jumping from a ledge to pole over a crate while doing backflips - this just might be a game for you.Add no savegame option (there are savepoints, but these are very, very far between), gameplay so linear it makes Pac Man and Space Invaders seem open-ended, and a pretty lame story - Voila, you have got Prince of Persia, The Sands if Time in a nutshell.Some graphics were ok though,,,,,Bargain bin fodder? Na, trashcan ratherJan, Norway"
1,Difficult to maneuver through camera angles,"The PC version is the one I bought so I am not sure how the game works on other boxes, but the camera angles switch so fast and unexpectedly, that the Prince gets turned around very easily. While the graphics are good, the camera gets in the way of your maneuvers, and sometimes prevents you from getting through time-sensitive traps. Also, Farah, your companion whom you are to protect along the way, seems to shoot the Prince with her bow, and generally seems to get in the way. I would not recommend the PC version of Prince of Persia Sands of Time."
3,Warning: Strange Grapphics Card Requirements,"I had to take this game back because it wouldn't work with my graphics card, an NVIDIA GeForce 4 MX. Since this is a VERY common graphics card, I thought I'd save people a similar experience. Here's a direct copy/paste from the Readme.txt from the Prince of Persia game CD:-Minimum Configuration:Win 98 SE/ME/2000/XP OnlyDirectX 9.0b800 MHz Pentium III, AMD Athlon or equivalent256 MB RAMNVIDIA GeForce 3 or higher (excluding NVIDIA GeForce 4 MX), ATI Radeon8500 or higher, Matrox ParheliaDirectX 8.0 compatible sound device1.4 GB hard drive spaceWindows-compatible mouse required-Recommended Configuration:Win 98 SE/ME/2000/XP OnlyDirectX 9.0b1.2 GHz Pentium 4, AMD Athlon or equivalent256 MB RAMNVIDIA GeForce 4 or ATI Radeon 9500DirectX 8.0 compatible sound device1.4 GB hard drive spaceWindows-compatible mouse requiredNote that that Geforce 3s ARE supported. I could load the game with a GeForce 4 MX, but the extremely low framerate made it unplayable."
3,Absolutely Awesome...but...,"I got this game recently and I must say that it rocks! The graphics and gameplay are cool. You'll be flying off walls, climbing on ledges, and everything else. There is one drawback which is the reason why I reated this at 3 and not 5. You are only able to use your keyboard to play this game, making it absolutely hard to perform combinations and special attacks. If you think programing a gamepad to perform as a keyboard, good luck. Tried that several ways and got nowhere. The game ignores all inputs but the keyboard and mouse. Besides that, the game has an awesome storyline. Would recomend but not for PC."
2,Not true to the Original,"First, let me say I don't write many Amazon reviews. I was looking forward to this game as soon as I heard it was being released on the PC. The original is a classic because it took player control to a new level. Although this game ""looks"" great, the control is non existent. Any first person shooter has a much better control interface. The mouse control doesn't add anything to player control.I am 25% through the game and it has only taken me about 40 minutes. The game hints tell you exactly what to do...there's only one way to get from one room to the next. The fighting scenes are boring. I just keep hitting ""attack"" and I haven't died once.It feels like you are constantly playing in a training mode. The cut scenes are OK, but the music in general is repetative.I don't know if I am going to continue playing it.If you want to watch a quasi interesting movie, you might like this game. If you want cool player control in interesting puzzle situations, pass on this game."
1,Prince of Presia Sands of Time,"POP is a waste of money POP offers nothing special, nothing unique nothing new it has a stupid story line If you like games that tamper with time get Max Payne 1 or 2"
4,Best Prince Of Persia experience,"Of the three POP that follow the line of Sands Of Time, this is the one that have the best experience of all, and that is because the gameplay of the game is linked absolutely with what is the truly POP essence. 100% recommended for the fans of the action-adventure genre."
5,It's the best!,"Prince of Persia is the best game I've played. Although I didn't like the way the camera moved when I was trying to do stuff (died a bunch because of this), I still enjoyed it. It's the kind of game you want to play again just to see if you'd missed anything. I have played it four times already. The combat is great. You have lots of ways to fight. You can just attack or you can vault over creatures or jump off of walls into them or jump off walls over them. You can freeze time or rewind time. There's even a love interest, if you're into that kind of thing. I really think that you should buy this."
1,Poor,"The item was sized incorrectly, I bought 4 size large and received irregulars that were marked large but were very small"
2,barely there comfort thigh shaper,"Fit ok, the waist rolled down constantly and the thighs had very uncomfortable bands at the bottom that dug into my legs and left unsightly ""rolls"". This was the correct size also! Was refunded $2.50 less of what I paid for it and I haven't received a reason why after my e-mail to Bealls Florida. Next time, I'll buy Spanx the real thing."
3,OK but not very good craftsmanship,It works OK but had some sharp edges from manufacturing process. I had to smooth this out so I would not get cut! Some Chrome was flaking off before I ever used it. Typical made in China poor Craftsmanship in manufacturing process! You would think thay woould at least make sure a hand tool does not have sharp metal sticking out before they sell it to you!
4,"Could be better, but serves its purpose.","As others have said, the striking end is not lined as indicated. This really isn't any big deal as the head is big enough that you shouldn't miss while striking it anyway. I would imagine most can use this tool without even hammering. In some areas it's almost easier not to. It has worked great for me so far. The only complaint is that the stamping isn't the best. They should have used a better quality mold to get the metal even all around especially on the striking head."
2,Not quite what package says,"Package says hammering end is supposed to be knurled to prevent slippage, but mine was shiny and slippery."
3,laguna beach - a love affair,the ususal 10% production.the lead actors were pretty good. some nice location shots and abunch of over(re)acting.i don't know what (gay)&(straight)male actors have to be afraid of in doing full frontal nudity. european actors do what is necessary for the story and it shows in the quality of their films.
2,Was the dialog supposed to be funny?,"This film has a few great moments and the story has potential, but it was ruined by inane dialog and stilted delivery."
5,Country Goodness in Country Garden.,"Having grown up here in the refreshing Georgia sun, I consider myself an expert in that belonging to the country. At least I thought I was until this CD opened my eyes to the beauty I had forgotten. English Country Garden is a cornicopia of visions told through sound, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for that special piece of goodness, back in the country."
3,Diamonbacks Only Lucky,"As a lifelong Yankees fan, this DVD is very good, except for the way it ended. Brings to mind the end of the 1960 World Series against Pittsburgh. Even though I was very young at the time, I still remember the heartache of the better team LOSING, as was the case in 2001 (Arizona wins on a bloop hit, unlike how the Yankees win with home runs...) Nevertheless, an exciting World Series - well covered in this presentation."
5,Perfect!!,"I am a Yankees fan. They may have lost this one but this was the best. After sweepin` the Padres and Braves, wining 4 games to 1 agenst the Mets, the towers colapsed. New York needed some relief. The Yankees won the pennant. Everyone was happy again. Sorrow had ridden on the city before this. Osama Bin Laden was on everyones deathlist. Untill the Yankees fans (and Mets fans) calmed down to watch the world series. 3 remarkable comebacks had happened in games 3,4,and 5 gave the yankees a 3-2 series lead. The miricle in The Bronx was over in a flash...New York0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 8 1Arizona1 3 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 15 22 0Game 6 belonged to the Diamondbacks. Game 7 came down to the 11th inning. ""The pitch..BASE HIT FOR GONZALEZ. THE DIAMONDBACKS HAVE WON THE WORLD SERIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""That broke the Yankees streak...this was though the best because even thoughYankees = HistoryDiamondbacks = FutureThe Yankees won the pennant and that was good enough"
1,not worth the money,Wish I had bought the panasonic model instead. There is nothing to write good about the picture other than it is about the same as a vhs video camera. Go with panasonic.
