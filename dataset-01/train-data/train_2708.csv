1,Melting Plastic,"Just got my wife a set of stainless steel coorware it came with a ""gift"" set of Calphalon which promptly metlted in the pan and ruined our meal and our cookware."
1,Smell like melting plastic when hot,"When these get hot they give off an awful chemical smell, sort of like melting plastic, which is probably what's happening. Very unappetizing. The smell does not go away after washing or using. NOT recommended."
2,Wrong item.,"Macy's does not provide correct description for this item, so don't believe it or what you see in this picture Macy's provided. I ordered these utensils and they had no steel parts whatsoever, just nylon and silicone. And between nylon and silicone there are like wide cracks, so it will be hard to clean and dry them.Don't order this product, you'll be disappointed. Completely wasted money!"
1,On Second thought.....,"When I began to search for new kitchen items, the first criteria was ""Made in America"". Somehow the levee was breached on that one. When these tools arrived, the individual slotted turner wasfirst and used foremost. I didn't plan on opening the boxed set until I knew I wanted to keep it. Since I did, they came out, and that ""MADE IN CHINA"" emblazoned on the box was made apparent.So what makes the tool flexible, yet not flammable? Some of that lead they've been putting in exports? Is this where the poison goes they're not putting in the dog food? Maybe the chemical they put in the toothpaste ended up here. Since I cannot bring myself to touch my food with these things, I'll keep them until I can donate them to some relief effort where someone else might not be so picky."
1,Ruined On First Use,"I was very excited to get my new non-stick Calphalon cookware and 4 piece nylon utensil set. The first time I cooked with high heat on my Calphalon non-stick skillet the nylon Calphalon spatula melted. The front edged flaked or melted, whatever you want to call it. It's now peeling into my food. Also, the solid spoon now has a white-ish tint to the front portion of the spoon after using it in boiling water. I have never put any utensils in the dishwasher or used them in a way other than what the manufacture recommends. I am deeply disappointed in this set. I will take it back for a refund as soon as I can find a superior replacement.Note: The box says silicone and nylon heat resistant to 500 and 400 degrees, respectively."
3,Doesn't live up to Calphalon name,"We received these utensils for a Christmas gift nearly two years ago. They do the job, and I like the silicone in the handle that allows you to rest the utensil in a pan or pot if necessary. For the last few months, however, they have started melting/ peeling at the edges- especially the spatula. Also, the pasta fork and the slotted spoon are a particular pain to clean. I won't buy these again, but I'll keep using them on my non-stick cookware until I decide what else to get."
1,Buy anything but these!,"We replaced every single cookware utensil we had with these Calphalons when we got married. I have never been more displeased with anything in my life. After just six months these utensils looked worse the the dollar store utensils we replaced, and we had those for 6 years! They plastic became milky looking like it was never clean. At first I thought it was our dish detergent but even after handwashing the utensils looked sad. Some of the utensils melted as well. I am embarrassed to take these to dinner parties to serve with. When we asked Calphalon for assistance with our issue we got no response. Will not own another Calphalon product again. Horrible purchase, please run the other way."
1,More Made-in-China Junk,"After the first few uses of the spatula, the front edge burned and bubbled up. This was during normal use cooking an egg and the spatula was never left in the pan for more then a few seconds. Extremely poor quality. The other utensils have not had any problems YET. The spatula was the most important tool."
1,Cleaning Nightmare!,"These look and feel great when you use them and washing them in the dishwasher or by hand is fine EXCEPT - the water stays in between the gray part of the utensil!!! You see the unit is not one piece, it's actually three pieces of plastic put together like Legos. Notice the gray part of the spoon, after several uses, it starts to pull away from the black part. You have to rinse them out forever under the water and then shake them out or take them apart so they can dry out properly. Poorly made :("
2,Not Durable,"These utensils look and feel great, but they are not durable. I don't use them heavily, maybe once or twice a week and not over excessive heat, but the ends have still become ragged and are flaking off. I was very surprised because I expected a lot better from Calphalon."
2,Not very durable,The edge of the spatula started flaking off. I have another Calphalon spatula that I purchased several years ago. It is still in great shape. It appears the quality has gone downhill.
4,It is one of it's kind,"I bought this about 2 years back, till now I did not have any problem. It is the only item you can get to play cassette, CD, MP3 and radio. Sony is not releasing any more of this type. It played some mp3 discs which other players did not play. I loved it's sound quality and radio signal pick up. The sound is enough for home use. Special mention is about it's remote. It is quite sensitive. Of course, you always get a sensitive remote controller from Sony.It plays everything fine. I will just say go for it."
2,Weak MP3,"This is one of the few boomboxes that will play MP3 files on CD-R or CD-RW. The trouble is that some files will play and others won't. The display simply will say ""NOT MP3"" and won't play the track. Other files play fine. Other than that very major flaw, it's a decent boombox considering the price."
1,One year and dead,"I am very disappointed in this Sony. I have had it for exactly one year and the CD Player has died. It was dying a slow death for a couple weeks now - skipping tracks, long start up time (especially MP3s which take a good five minutes to read) and poor sound. It just died today - it can no longer read any type of disk I put into it.For the price it is a joke. You can get a lot better value than this player.It does have MP3 capability, CD, tapes and AM/FM, but for me the most important thing was the CDs and noteably the MP3 function.Shop around. You can certainly do better!"
5,GREAT VALUE!,"This is a GREAT product when you consider what you paid. My portable MP3-CD player cost about as much and has much less to offer.Just keep in mind; this is a portable tabletop stereo. It is great for smaller rooms like a home office or a bedroom. If you're looking for an earth-shaking, high fidelity boom box, you'll likely be disappointed. But if you're looking for a lightweight, portable stereo that has CD, CD-R, CD-RW & MP3 capability, a digitized AM-FM stereo tuner & cassette with decent sound and all at a relatively inexpensive price, this is definitely the ticket. The sleep timer and the remote are definite plusses too."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING - Don't buy it,"I was very excited to see a boombox with MP3 capability and was delighted to see the SONY label. But now I'm only frustrated and very angry. So far, SONY has been unable to give me a clear explanation or solution to the problem I am experiencing.This unit is apparently VERY fussy about what sorts of MP3's it will play and won't play. It appears as though advanced ID3 tags will cause songs to skip the very beginning of songs. AT least that is my theory. What appears to be the case is that very primitive MP3's will play fine; more sophisticated MP3's will NOT. In my opinion, this unit is NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME. And certain not worth the price.On the positive side, SONY's technical people have been very patient with me (more patient than I have been), but have been unable to provide a solution, at least so far.As for ordinary CD's, not a bad boombox. But you can get cheaper boomboxes. So why pay more for a major feature (MP3) that doesn't function well at all?"
1,Loved It Until It Broke,"This was a great player until it stopped working. After having it for about six months, CDs stopped playing in it. The same No Disc error others have seen had struck. I contacted Sony to get it repaired or replaced. They would not replace it but said they could repair it for $77 plus shipping. So if you buy it, maybe you'll get lucky and yours will work without a problem for longer than six months, but when it breaks don't expect any help from Sony."
1,No Disc/No Disc/No Disc,I can't believe that I went the extra mile to buy Sony and this happens. I am very disappointed. Of course it would happen about 1 month after warranty runs out. Sure you can mail it in for repairs but why not just buy another stereo. Definitely a product to RUN from.
3,Weak,Didn't have a clock. The display is to small for that much info. and the biggest problem is that it's not loud. It's really weak and distorts really easy. You can find better Mp3 boombox. I did.
3,Two characters in one,"This episode of Star Trek Voyager is interesting and in it's own way, thought-provoking....but I do not consider it a ""must see"" for Voyager fans.The basic plot involves a transporter accident in which the characters of Tuvok and Neelix are merged into one ""person"". The resulting character, of course, resembles both of these very different individuals only somewhat.The story only gets interesting, however, when we discover that ""Tuvix"" has taken on an identity and personhood of his own and does not want to ""die"" in order to return both Tuvok and Neelix to their previous forms. There is much angst on the part of Janeway regarding the decision to order Tuvix to submit to the separation procedure....but of course we all know how this one will end, so there is not much mystery!The episode in enjoyable enough, but like Kes, I found myself being very uncomfortable with this character of Tuvix. I'll give this episode 3 stars."
3,Tuvix,"While on an away mission on a planet. Neelix picks some flowers that have an interesting genetic trait. He and Tuvok beam aboard voyager but upon materializing only one person stands. Somehow the flowers Neelix picked when beamed with Tuvok and himself fused their DNA together. Now a completely new person with a new personality resides on Voyager. As the weeks go by, and he loses hope of being able to be separated, he chooses the name Tuvix and begins assuming the roles of both Tuvok and Neelix. Eventually the doctor finds a way to separate them but will he let them do it? Not telling!"
2,"Love PSB, but redundant","Nicely packaged collection of PSB, but if you have all of the double CD reissues and/or the Disco CD's, you're covered. The new 2 new singles are not that striking."
1,PSB - 5 Stars....Copy Protection Zero!!!!!!,"DO NOT BUY this or any other insidiously copy-protected CD. This is not the same digital audio disc you have been buying for 20 years, but rather, a non-conforming good. Phillips has forced manufacturers to remove the ""CD-Audio"" label from discs containing copy protection. This practice is in violation of the court-upheld doctrine of ""Fair Use"", i.e., making copies of the music you have purchased for YOUR OWN PERSONAL USE. This technology does NOTHING to stop the illegal copying and distribution of CDs, as it can be easily defeated by a determined individual, and thereafter distributed ad infinitum. This technology only serves to hinder the enjoyment of the LEGAL purchaser, by preventing the creation of back-up copies or digitized copies for a PC or portable player. Send a message to these greedy people by not buying copy-protected CDs."
5,Florida Shorts is a brilliant delicious anthology.,"This creative book, written by a diverse talented group of five, offers short stories, excerpts, essays and poems. The collection leaves no seed unturned in sprouting a bouquet of emotions and genres making it a delight for every reader.The book is broken down into six categories. Each category is as delectable as the next. I found the entire book and all the writers appealing. I especially liked ""The Elevator"" by Estelle Lipp and the ""Butcher and the Blonde"" by Nancy Wayman Deutsch. The poems in the section Poems from the Back Pocket are fresh and enchanting.This book is for all who would enjoy a sparkle of sunshine in their day. Florida Shorts is a chance to discover the dashing writing abilities of five first rate writers. Well done.Sherry RussellMidwest Book Review"
2,BORING,"This in my opinion is the worst toy little tikes has ever made. There really is nothing to this toy...It may be worth $40 but definitly not $100....My nephews..and my own daughter get very bored with it...The design is very poor too...I would have expected something better from the company....perhaps more peter pan/ captin hook ....This product definitly needs to be improved, and then remarketed"
5,Excellent cookbook!,"I have the first cookbook - Beyond Parsley and love it. This 2nd book is also very good - simple recipes, but different and look so elegant."
4,The Bravery,"The name of this band caught my eye, and to be honest I was not expecting what I eventually heard. Not knowing anything about the band, ( and usually listeners don't have a relationship that would constitute 'knowing them') I will attempt to give a relatively un-bias oppinion according to my standards in music. I felt this album had a pop/ techno sound to it. Usually I wouldn't be a fan of this, but The Bravery was an exception. Starting with ""An Honest Mistake"", each song was catchy and kept my attention. I found myself eagerly anticipating each new song, and I was never dissapointed with what I heard. In the end, I gave this a four star rating because I do recommend this album for music lovers that enjoy new sounds. However, I think there is much more to come from The Bravery, and I will waite for their next album to award it with five stars."
1,Junk,"Bought this along with a 12"" Disco ball for our daughter for Christmas. While the Amazon delivery was, as always, right on time (actually early), the gearing for the motor was not in place when I took it out of the box (you could hear the gears rattle inside the motor housing just by handling the unit), the on/off switch was not not even affixed to the housing and the wiring connection cracked while trying to get the switch in place. Absolute garbage and not worth contacting the manufacturer for a replacement. Avoid at all costs unless you like throwing money in the garbage. Not even one star."
1,Horribly noisy unit,"At least this one arrived in working order. The only situation I'd consider this device useful is in an already noisy environment (such as a dance hall/room) where there is no AC power available.I had planned to use this motor to turn a mobile on my screen porch in a spot where AC power is not readily available, but this unit emits a loud, ugly, and irritating grinding noise. It totally defeats the relaxing environment I was intending. If I had known that this thing was going to be so noisy I would not have bothered with it. A very disappointing purchase."
1,Terrible company.....broken product.,This product arrived and was flimsy and did not work. I returned it to the company. They claim non-receipt. I have proof from the post office of its return yet they continue to dispute it with my credit card company. I will not do business with this company again.
1,"Slow, SLOW and SLOWEST Shipping I've ever had","I'm not concerned with the actual product, but I chose the free shipping option and I guess somebody wanted to punish me for doing so as it took 35 days to get it from the day I ordered it. After 2 weeks, it said it was processing the shipment. Books I ordered the same day and with free shipping came 3 days later but no, not the switch.Amazon didn't even bother to reply to my emails requesting to cancel this order since it didn't give the option for it. Had I know it was going to take this long I could have went and got a switch locally the same day for a few bucks more.To me, this is a reflection of the product if I ever needed tech support (not likely since I'll just throw it in the trash and get one locally next time), as it probably would take days or weeks to get support if the shipping is this SLOW.Yep, learned my lesson, don't buy anything hardware related from Amazon, just books as I've never had a problem with that."
2,Not for travel,"My eye doctor has these with his name and number printed on it. I tried to take the case with me today in my purse in case I needed to remove my contacts and store them, but when I opened the case, all the solution had leaked out! This could be used for storing at home, but don't take it with you."
2,Good acting for a terrible part,"Lien did a good job of acting like a madman, but I really didn't like her acting like this at all. I mean, a break from the complete niceness was good, but this was too much! I would give this 1 star instead of 2 for the story itself, but Lien's performance led me to go with 2 stars."
3,In the Name of Iran,"What I learn from this book that Iran means land of Nobel, and would try to go back to root of all religion by exploring Zoroastrian faith. I"
4,Very Informative,I really enjoyed this book. It gave me some real interesting insight on how present day Iran and the Persian Empire have passed on some of the great religious philosophy that millions of people still practice today.
1,Not worth the time reading,"This book is more about the authors political views than a study of religions in Iran. I found comparison of present murderous Islamic state of Iran with US democracy unacceptable and nauseating, however, very typical far-left relativism rational. I did not enjoy or learn anything I would like to remember reading this book and found myself skipping paragraphs at a time. If there was a 0 star rating I would select 0 but there is not so 1 it is."
5,Nice!,"This set is beautiful. My set had some spotting on the giraffe spoon. These look like they'll last a few generations if taken care of. They are well balanced and feel good, solid, and heavy in the hands. They aren't to heavy they just feel right. They are very shiny and brilliant. You wont want to use that cheapo plastic set anymore. A classy, fun, and stylish set. The only way they could be better is if they came in solid sterling silver."
4,No knife?,"I love this feeding set! The animals are adorable, but I'm surprised that it comes with 2 spoons but no knife. I understand that there's another Reed & Barton set that has an ""alligator"" knife instead of a 2nd spoon. I may end up trading this set for the set with the knife. Even if I don't trade, I'm sure that I'll pass this set on to my son when he's having his first child!"
5,Reed & Barton Silver Safari Baby Flatware Set,The baby and her mother love the silverware and use it every day. Delivery was very quick. I'm very pleased with Amazon.
1,I also only received a single clamp and on top of that it was malformed,"I was hoping that these ""clamps"" would meet my needs and I needed quite a few. 25... PERFECT.My wife calls me up at work that the package arrived with just one clamp in it. Then, to add insult to injury, the clamp had a malformed handle and also the gripping pads didn't line up right.Amazon was great to get me squared away, so ultimately not a big deal but for those of you looking for clamps similar to this, I would recommend to keep on looking as this product will just waste your time.It's funny though, on the little cellophane baggie that the clamp came in, it even says that it is a 25 pack."
4,Summer reading for pre-school!,"This book was chosen as the summer reading book for my granddaughter's preschool program. At first I didn't get the point and I didn't particularly like the book, but she did. After reading it several times to her, she was able to just about quote the book herself (I guess that is what the author intended), I began to discover little things about each page that she found funny and interesting.All in all, a good book for the 3-4 year old set!"
4,"""Heresy"" is a four letter word!","Peter Jones gives a fairly well researched analysis of the parallels between Gnosticism and the New Age movement. As the negative reviews of ""Gnostic Empire Strikes Back,"" prove, Peter Jones is correct when he concludes that the New Age ideals of tolerance are only skin deep. How quickly the champions of pluralism and tolerance rise to the occasion to denounce Christians as ""paranoid"" and ""narrow."" Why not review the book instead of denouncing the author with the shibboleth of ""fundamentalist""? It seems the only heresy today is orthodox Christianity.The book is a short read, really just a quick historical overview of Gnosticism and an analysis of the parallels between it and New Age spirituality. It is not a comprehensive study into either Gnosticism or New Age thought, but an introduction primarily intended for Christians. It is a bit dated, having been published in 1992, but still applies nonetheless."
1,Paranoid,"Peter James anti-female,anti-education views of the world are delusional and rabid. A 90s version of the Salem witch burnings."
4,A Beautiful Restraint,"BjörkMusic From The Drawing Restraint 9This is a soundtrack composed by Björk with minimal vocals for celebrated contemporary visual artist Matthew Barney's next film Drawing restraint 9, in which she also appears.The soundtrack music uses a combination of many instruments such as the harp, harpsichord and celeste, trumpet, trombone and oboe, electronic basslines, and children's choir. The collection of songs also seems to bring the best of both worlds from Vespertine and Medulla in terms of the whimsical bells of the former (Ambergris March and Cetacea) and the human beatbox of the latter (the Japanese-infused Pearl, Shimenawa and the 10-minute Holographic Entrypoint). On the poignant opener Gratitude, Will Oldham sings with much raw emotion that tinkers.The songs put together do exude a weird quality but is unquestionably a very accomplished masterpiece, though not music to everyone's ears. Those who get it will be greatly rewarded, no less. (A)"
3,SMAC,"Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri is reason enough alone to buy this pack, at this price. It's hands down the best game in the set, the others kinda suck."
1,A TOTAL FAILURE IN MY OPINION,There is nothing to merit this CD. It is overproduced and tacky. On the bottom of my list of Reba product.
1,Have you listened to this???,"This, in my opinion, is the WORST one out of her collection. There is a reason the critic and FANS did not like this. It is an awful, boring record. Not even a must for TRUE diehard fans."
1,"THE ""NADIR"" OF REBA'S CAREER","This overproduced contrived mess is beyond reproach. The critics were all in solid agreement on this one: A big mistake in Reba's career. They were right. She could have at least chosen better songs as some others have mentioned. Why she would record ""On My Own"", or ""You're No Good"" is a mystery. The songs are clearly not worthy of her. And she certainly could have picked better country tunes than ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"" and ""500 Miles Away From Home"". This certainly is the ""Nadir"" of Reba's recording career."
1,A TOTAL DISASTER!,"As the previous reviewer posted, Reba herself dismisses this effort because the critics lambasted it. With good reason. No one should undertake to cover songs that have become classics by others because there is no way that one could make them their own. Reba thought she could. She was wrong. Justification? There were no number one hits for her on this one. The ""rock tunes"" are the worst, the country tunes are merely passable but as a whole, this CD is a complete disaster. Stay away from this one. There are better Reba CDs out there."
1,NOT ENOUGH TO SATISFY,"The prize of the pack here is ""I Won't Mention It Again"" which Reba does better than Ray Price ever did!! That one should have been released as a single. ALso noteworthy are ""Talking In Your Sleep"" and ""Starting Over"". Acceptable is ""Ring on Her Finger"". That makes four songs out of the ten here that make this a quarter palatable. The rest of the songs are way below average, the worst being the fluffy pop ones like ""On My Own"" one of the worst songs I've ever heard in my life and ""You Keep Me Hanging On"". Reba totally destroys ""You're no Good"" the old Linda Rondstadt tune!!"
2,NOT TOO BAD; SHE COULD HAVE PICKED BETTER SONGS!,"Given her catastrophic output in the decade of the 90s, Reba has a classic CD here. Just kidding. But it is better than all of her 90s stuff (except For My Broken Heart). She could have picked better songs though. I think she does an admirable job on ""Talking In Your Sleep"", ""I Won't Mention It Again"", ""Starting Over"" and ""Ring on Her Finger"". I agree the worst are the rock tunes...""You're No Good"", ""On My Own"" and ""You Keep Me Hanging On"". I skip over those when I listen to this CD. They're just awful. ""Please Come to Boston"" is mediocre and ""500 Miles Away From HOme"" is easily replaceable. ""By The Time I Get to Phoenix"" is dull. If she had picked some better songs, this CD would be a keeper because I think Reba makes the songs I liked on it, her own."
1,Deal with It....A Terrible Release!,The less said about this hodgepodge of remakes the better. Reba should be ashamed of herself.
1,"LETS DO KARAOKE, REBA!!","If you want a good example of someone doing Karaoke, this is the CD for you!!! I've never heard anything like it my life. The worst cut, and one of the worst mistakes of Reba's recording career is her horrible rendition of ""On My Own"", a really horrible song not helped any by Reba's backups..Martina McBride and Linda Davis. Oh gosh, the rest of the tunes here nowhere near begin to give us the magic of the originals. THe less said about this debacle, the better."
1,I WOULD SAY ITS THE WORST SHE'S EVER RECORDED!,"That seems to be a running comment here ""either the worst she's ever done or close to it"". I would say it is the worst. And she's put out some bad ones in her day...mostly her latest conversion to pop music. But this one really hit bottom. Unreedemable!!"
1,GOOD EXCEPT FOR......,"The rock and roll and pop songs (You Keep Me Hangin' On) and the disastrous ""On My Own""!! Reba is way out of her league here and she should have chosen lesser known classics to ""Start Over"" to avoid the inevitable comparisons that were bound to surface because the originals were incomparable. Reba did not make them her own here. The worst is Ray Price's ""I Won't Mention It Again"". She totally butchered that one!"
2,Not Right for Reba,"I like Reba. Her voice is just not right to cover these songs at all. She is all country, and songs such as ""Keep Me Hangin On"" and ""You're No Good"" just aren't. She also tries too hard and overdoes it on a lot of the songs. ""Please Come to Boston"" is the only one I liked."
1,WHAT A [...]!!,"[...] Reba would even dare think she was good enough to top the originals here. She could have at least done better to pick good material. Why she did ""On Our Own"" (which was a big mistake on all counts and wasn't even a hit for her....her first flop as a single in years as a matter of fact) was a mystery. ""You Keep Me Hanging On"" leaves me with a desire to let go quickly! She tries [...] ""Talking in Your Sleep"" but she can never match Crystal Gayle's original version! Nor can she match Dolly's ""Starting Over"". However I'll give the CD one star because I did like her version of Lee Greenwood's ""RIng on Her FInger"" better than I ever liked his. I never like him anyhow. This is fluff and I agree Karaoke style singing on most counts!!"
5,"Stellar Performace, One of Reba's Best","Starting Over is one of Reba's best, next to her 1994 masterpiece Read My Mind. However, Starting Over didn't fare as well in the reviews. Many viewed it as too pop, and boring. I beg to differ.Starting Over showcases some of the best singing Reba has ever done. She pours her emotion into the ballads, kicks it up on the uptempo songs. Reba sings like she has felt this pain, and expresses it to the listeners as if she's their best friend. It is pop-country, but Reba has that wonderful southern accent. No matter what she crosses into she will always be country, always.All the songs are the cut on here. It is the perfect collection for a country fan, and a must for fans of Reba."
5,Information Packed,"This book is an excellent overview of logistics and supply chain management. I own dozens of texts on these subjects and this is one of the best. If your looking for a college text with problems to work out; then this is not the book for you. But, if your looking for quick insight into these topics, this is an excellent choice. The book quickly teaches the reader strategy, industry trends and supplies some basic quantitative tools. The industry examples bring the topics to life. Two thumbs up from me."
1,Boring book,Keeps repeating the same things over and over using different words. Very boring and nothing new to learn.
1,Martin Christopher Can't Do Math,"Page 60: ""20% of customers buying 20% of the products = 4% of all customer/product transactions""There are some glaring errors here:1. The general rule is, 20% of customers give you 80% of your business.2. Christopher asserts that 20% of customers purchase 20% of your products, then it stands to reason that the other 80% of your customers give you the other 80%.3. If these 20% of customers give 4% of all customer/product transactions, do the other 80% of your customers give 96%? Obviously not!There are MORE errors."
5,Photos,The Photography in this volume is excellent. It is rare to find a book that gives photos showing both front and side profile for every breed.
3,I'm NOT impressed - poor quality photographs,"I was so very excited when i had ordered this book. I just couldn't wait to get my hands on it. And when it finally arrived, I was sooo amazed. It's such a larges book. Must be 6-7 cm thick, its looks are impressive. And the wording is good. I will use this book. BUT, and this is a major *BUT*: THE PICTURES ARE SOMETIMES REALLY BAD. I cant believe that they even choosed to print some of these really poor quality pictures. It's depressive that they didnt try to get more decent pictures, even to the 5th print!"
2,great service-poor product,"book was one that i wanted, but because of an error at the printers, many pages were missing."
5,It is an enjoyable book,"Very good to give you a better knowledge of dogs breeds of the world. One thing that I think needs to be improved is the amount of information on each breed. + the book should include a table on the breeds of dogs there, aggresion and capability of responding to training. Overall it is an enjoyable book which I recommend to all dog lovers."
4,Good Product,"Was glad to find Aura Cacia produces lavendula augustifolia and at a reasonable price. Though it is not my first choice, it is afffordable and effective."
1,"Gave me headache, nightmares","I bought this because someone suggested that a drop of lavender essential oil in a diffuser in my bedroom would help me get restful sleep. I don't know if it is lavender oil in general, or this particular formulation, but this made me quite sick."
2,Great score. Where is it? (on the DVD...),"The powers that be should have released an ""orchestral score only"" Apollo 13 soundtrack, as was done for (for example) _L. A. Confidential_. As it is, James Horner's beautiful, inspiring, and amazing work is obscured by intercutting with dialog and period pop tunes, and much of it is simply missing in action. An ""orchestral score only"" CD was actually compiled and pressed, but not released for sale; it was distributed to Motion Picture Academy members for award consideration. It sometimes turns up on eBay. Better yet, just buy the movie DVD -- the full orchestral score (exactly as released on the Academy CD) plays behind the title menus. And you get the movie too..."
3,How to get the original Apollo 13 sound track-,"Buy the DVD. After the movie starts, go to the DVD menu. The entire sound track plays while the menu is on screen. At this point you can burn it onto a CD."
4,"I'd like less fluff, but...","This is a good, if not great, rendition of the music for ""Apollo 13"". Problem: soundtracks which seem to cut against the mood established by Horner's original music. Truth is, when I hear this one, I frequently avoid everything but Horner's original compositions and the movie dialogs. THEN you can feel as if you were watching the movie. Two more things: 1)the female vocalist adds an almost dreamlike mood to the score; 2)the main title, which is excellent, draws and expands upon Copland's ""Fanfare for the Common Man"". Listen to it and be make your own conclusions."
3,"Great job by Horner, but please leave the other music out","In Apollo 13, James Horner did a great job of writing very emotional music, that fit very well with the film. Also, unlike some of his other works that repeat itself with others he has done (listen to Cocoon and Star Trek 2), there really aren't any notes or themes that are repeated in this. If the sountrak only included James Horner's work, it would've been a 5 easily. But they had to stick in the other songs that were in the movie. Now the extra quotes they stick into this soundtrak I can live with, but except for maybe one or two, the songs on this soundtrak just flat out,,, stink. With that said, if you are looking for a great James Horner CD, I suggest you buy it. But be prepared with what comes with it"
2,Get rid of the songs...,"Horner's music is fantastic, but having the songs stuck in just makes the c.d. awful. I'd much prefer the original score only album."
4,Goosebumps!,"Although I have listened to the soundtrack numerous times and watched the movie several times as well, the ""Launch"" cut still overawes me and brings me almost to tears. James Horner's soundtrack is a suitable companion to a movie which can only be a tribute to the human spirit. Horner's use of an almost ethereal chorus is beautiful! As someone who especially enjoys soundtracks, I would place this in the top five of all time. Horner has demonstrated he is the leading soundtrack composer today. ""Apollo 13"" is a worthy companion to ""Glory"" and ""Titanic"". The only reason I gave this recording 4 stars is the ""padding"" of 60s hits and some of the dialogue (although elements of the dialogue included are very good). This is not a ""pure"" soundtrack as a result, but one that everyone who saw the movie should have."
3,If only...,"First thoughts--it's a beautifully written score. Haunting parts for horns, including the beautiful title piece; two amazing tracks featuring vocals by Annie Lennox.Second thoughts--it's a horribly executed album. Whenever a piece of music gets off the ground--and before it can come to a complete end, it's truncated by snippets of dialogue from the film. Additional ""period"" songs don't compliment the album on the whole, although the new recording of ""Blue Moon"" by the Mavericks is quite good.On the whole, it could have been better!"
5,Original score is moving and patriotic,"The CD is a good mix of 60s/70s rock & pop and a moving original score. The original score is very ""American"". It's the best movie soundtrack since ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"""
4,Dynamite CD,"I like how the CD has both the full versions of the songs used in Apollo 13 (""Spirit in The Sky"", ""Blue Moon"", ""Somebody to Love"", and others), intersperced with the soundtrack/action. By including the dialogue, it makes a good ""audio book"" for the movie.The 24K CD is awesome! Because of the vastly superior sound quality, listening to the launch on CD is more dramatic than watching it on video.I only give 4 stars because many of the tracks would be better without the dialogue. (especially the music that is played when the astronauts are sailing around the dark side of the moon.)"
2,"Good, if you get a good one","First review: I've been wearing mascara for more decades than I'd like to admit; this is one of the better ones I've tried. It is possible to smudge it but it takes quite a lot for that to happen. This mascara is just as good at lengthening and thickening as other masacaras but without the strange little particles the others add to accomplish that feat.Second review: After having ordered a few more of these, half of them turned out to be unusable. The mascara would come out in big gooey globs and nothing I tried could fix the problem. I ended up having to throw brand new ones away. I should have tried to get my money back but got too busy. I no longer buy this product because it's just as likely you'll get a bad one as a good one."
3,Pretty good,"This book is informative and entertaining, but I think it dwells too much on Jane Austen's relatives and not enough on Jane herself."
5,Great way to encourage higher order thinking skills...,"This game provides a wonderful, motivating, effective way for children to practice their basic math facts in the four operations in a context that promotes higher order thinking skills. I am the principal of an elementary school, and we incorporate the use of this game into lunch periods and indoor recess. In order to avoid frustration, the users should have basic grasp of the basic facts in additon, subtraction, multiplication, and division."
5,Great Math Game,"I played this game often in Elementary school. It was one of my FAVORITE games, and it still is. It helps to sharpen basic math skills and strategies. And even if you finish every card, when you begin again, you probably will have forgotten the strategy you used before and use a different strategy to obtain the solution, which makes the game ""reusable"". Many pre-printed games like trivial pursuit become useless once you play to the point where you have memorized all the answers. I can guarantee every card will look like a new math problem each time you play it. The only complaint I have would be that the game is cardboard. Although it is a sturdy cardboard, it is still cardboard and not too durable in the long run. But still it is a worthwhile game to have!"
5,very neat game!!,"I got these for my son to study for the Challenge 24 math competion he had coming up, but we soon found the whole family playing. Of course, it took me and dad a little longer to figure out the answers, but it is a great way for the whole family to be involved and play together AND is educational!"
4,Wonderful game for the entire family,"The 24-Game cards are great for a family evening.My 11 year old was already hooked onto this at school but now with these cards at home, my 8 year old also loves to play with these cards to get the number 24. We as a family have fun challenging each other trying to make 24 with the cards."
3,How wealthy we are in the Western World.,"First thing is first. Book is in colour. Did I not read that? Do not know, was expecting B&W. Second, 400 pages of which I believe 50+ were provactive and made me think. Provactivity was why I bought the book, and why I suspect others did/will too. Wanted to be woken up from my slumber: to know what it is really like over there. But 50/400 pages is not a high ratio, hence my 3 stars. (To be honest, some of the photos I felt I could've taken myself.) Notwithstanding this, there were some shots that demanded a reality check. How wealthy we are in the Western World..."
1,"Not for everyone, and certainly not for me.","For me, the only thing this book proves is that in the post-Soviet Ukraine, the homeless can be subjected to exploitation and forced loss of dignity for a small sum of money. The degrading conditions of the people could be shown without having the photographer subject the people to further degradation. By the way, this was the most poorly bound book that I have ever received. Upon the first (and last) reading, groups of 10-20 pages were coming out in handfuls. Not a problem - I threw it away."
4,Dogs Love This!,"Normally I would consider salmon snacks to be for cats, but my dog loved these little treats! These are actual dried scraps of salmon, not processed treats of crushed salmon by-product. The only reason I give this product four stars rather than five is that they smell kind of, well, fishy."
5,The Best Country Music CD Ever Made!,"Although I listen to country music all the time simply because my family does, I am not much of a country music fan; at least I wasn't until these guys came along. I now have all of their CDs, but ""Music For All Occasions"" is my favorite of all. I listen to just about every kind of music there is, but if I were stranded on a deserted island and could only choose one CD to listen to for the rest of my life, this one would be it. No question about it!"
2,A big let down from their previous work,"Don't get me wrong, I love the Mavericks. Raul Malo's voice captures the soul, and is one of the best around. But I had to ask myself when I heard this album, what is up with this? Raul does the Roy Orbison better than anybody, but that's not all he can do. I saw them in concert and in one song he sounded exactly like Jonny Cash. Since he can do so much he shouldn't limmit himself to doing just one type of music. Plus, anybody that's ever seen them perform knows that they've never been able to capture their energy on stage on an albuml. The closest they've gotten is the latest, Trampoline. What a Cryin' Shame was such a great true country album, and From Hell To Paradise was such a great alternative country album, I don't know what happened to them with this. I guess it's good for them to experiment, but they could do so much more. (Luckily, they have with Trampoline.)"
3,All but...,"To be as honest as I can be. I love all the songs on this album except for the highly successful CMA award winning single for ""Here Comes the Rain"". Not only did I hate that song, but I hated the video even more. It lacked artistry, mystery, mood or much of anything else that The Mavericks have normally displayed in their videos. Those spooky albino-like kids gave me the creeps. And the girl with red hair in it, looked like a freaky, bizarre representation of Raggedy Ann gone wrong, petrified as she looked in the camera. For the rest of the video's content, what was going on in there? As for the song, it is at the bottom of the scale. Overall, I hated it. Everytime I see that video on CMT, I cringe because it looks so low budget and seemingly not up to par with what I think The Mavericks represented. Since then and for the rest of the album, it is memorable and melodious and haunting. But that's just my opinion, okay."
4,Cute and fun,We have been gradually adding to my son's train set. The bridge is a cute and fun addition and he seems to like pulling the cars through this bridge/tunnel.
3,Wobbly - use as a tunnel now,"It makes a great tunnel, but the wood pieces to this China made item is not study and does not really attach to bottom of big piece."
2,Too unstable for small kids to use,"This bridge has become a ""tunnel"" in our home. The bridge section is very solid and pleasantly painted but sits loosely on two blocks that act as supports. You need to position these supports carefully so that they also support the track and stop it from falling. A small movement and the bridge or the track comes tumbling down. After this occurred about 10 times in the first hour we now just use it as a tunnel. My kids are 2 and 3, this may work better for older kids, but my guess is that by the time the kids have the dexterity and the patience to use this bridge they will have grown out of Thomas the train anyway."
3,"Fun bridge, but wobbly on the blocks","This is a fun bridge for toddler boys. They really like the tunnel part. But the bridge just sits on the blocks (there is no fastening or more secure attachment). So, even with normal boys' play (nothing rough), the bridge keeps falling off the support blocks. So the boys don't really use that part at all. We also got the Thomas over-and-under bridge, which is a better buy because they can use both the tunnel part & the top part - and nothing falls off."
4,Origin,"This episode is very thought provoking in that it deals with a race encountered by the Voyager crew which supposedly evolved from dinosaurs and traveled thousands of light-years from Earth to the Delta quadrant. A scientist from this very advanced species is trying to prove to his people what he calls the ""distant origin theory"" with the help of Chakotay. His belief is rejected by his people and he is imprisoned along with the Voyager Crew, will they ever escape?"
1,Preaching scientific theory,"This episode came across as simply preaching the theory of evolution. I realize that it is the premise that Star Trek stands upon, but who needs to be preached at in an episode. I found this episode boring, and to be a big attack at any religion. So much for being tolerant like Star Trek supposedly is!"
5,Great at explaining concepts.,"Most math advances came as a result of a real-life problem. As the problem came up, math was developed to find a solution. This book uses a story line where problems are encountered to explain the conceptual basis of the math concept. The story is a little cheesy, but fun. What I really like about this text is that it explains the concept, and the reasoning behind the concept well. I used it in college, and now that I'm reviewing Calculus to become an actuarian, it's proving useful again. I don't know how you are, but I don't like memorizing math, I like understanding math, and this book helps me with that."
4,I understand it and I'm fourteen!,"(Disclaimer) Supposedly this covers first-year calculus. I don't know, I'm a freshman in high school.With that being said, this is a great book. The story begins in the magical land of Camorra, where several strong personalites are scratching their heads over a calculus problem they must solve. They eventually discover the solution, supplying the reader with a good, easy-to understand explonation, and eventually discover a whole bunch of other stuff. I'm a freshman and I understood most of it (still scratching my head about the connection between areas and integrals, though.)The book has its shortcomings, e.g. its being a bit ambiguious sometimes, but it's much better than a textbook. If a fourteen-year-old can get it, you should be able to too!"
4,Refreshing and helpful method,A cute story line to keep the student's interest and give them problems with application. Knowing the reason something is important is half the battle of the desire to learn. It is an interesting approach that makes learning part of an interesting puzzle to be solved. Combines the learn-by-discovery and learn-by-adventure method in an original and fun format.
1,Calculus if you already know calculus,If you need to learn Calculus form scratch don't buy this book. It is fun reading but there is too little explanation and hardly any examples of the problems they assign at the end of the chapters. If you have already had a couple of courses in Calculus this would be a great review book. But it just doesn't live up to it's name.
2,Know what you're buying...,"After being very impressed by Barron's Organic Chemistry book, which I used to help me study for the PCAT, I bought this Calculus book without looking inside. It's nothing like the other book I bought. It's written like a novel, with ponderous medieval settings and dialogue used to explain calculus concepts that should really be straightforward.I hated it. Maybe if you have no practical need for learning calculus, or if you have infinite time on your hands to do so, you'll like it. But for me, it made it 1000 times more difficult to learn. I had to dig through mountains of foolishness to find what was really a simple rule. It's not like it balances the ""fun"" with a clear presentation of concepts--it's all fun, and the concepts themselves are hidden like Easter eggs. Calculus the hard way, if you ask me. I'd rather have a regular calculus textbook any day, if they weren't so darn expensive."
3,"Perhaps a bit childish, but it does simplify the subject","It sometimes reads like it's written for 7th graders, but explaining calculus within a fairy tale does have advantages. What other calculus book would you read in the bathroom? I've found it helpful, but wouldn't recommend it as your only supplementary text. Buy it, by all means, but also get the meatier Schaum's outlines or REA's Calculus problem solver"
1,Buy a REAL Calculus book,"Really what is with the ratings for this book? They are allgood!Simple fact, this book is TOO simplified. You won't learnmuch, if anything. Parametric Equations and Power Series are nowhere to be found. Both are very usefull. And where is the limit. Many details are left out.I suggest if you take Calculus, read the text book, they are usually good, but remember, if you do not care, there is little hope for anything to work.Good books to get: Calculus by James Stewart (Brooks/Cole) and Calculus by Larson, Hostetler, and Edwards (DC Heath)"
4,doesn't feel patronizing to me,"This book isn't really for people who hate math. Nor is it for people who are already advanced and have a 'math brain' -- such people probably will find it rather patronizing, as they have no need for this book. It's for people who are definitely interested in math and would like to learn it, but need to learn it in an interesting and interactive way. While you read, you feel like you're figuring things out with the characters in the book. You aren't just told what the answers are -- you are developing the answers and understanding what they mean much more than you would from some old textbook."
2,Not that great,Someone told me these were the best nail files ever. I am thinking not so much. The only edge that is rough enough to shape my nail is the very little top edge. The rest of the file is more like a buffer and way too soft to shape my nails properly. I'm not very happy with this product and won't buy it again..
1,Are you kidding me?,"I bought 2 items: TheRuby Stone Nail Fileand theRuby Stone & Nail Buffer.They are exactly the same and both are TERRIBLE.They are like rubbing your nail with a long flat dull stone. What I could do in 10 seconds with a cheap dollar store file, it would take me 5 minutes of filing with these. I was so pissed I showed how weak they were to my husband and he laughed his ass off.""But they both got such good reviews on Amazon"" I said...And he laughed even harder.The next day I went back and tried to use them again (just to make sure i wasn't going crazy the night before) and yes, they really are useless. Completely useless."
2,"Mediocre, UseGoldstein","This book lacks good examples, and continuosly alters the time scale to ""simplify"" equations, which merely makes the form confusing. Classical Mechanics by Goldstein is far superior. Although the problems in Goldstein are much more difficult, the content is more thorough and straightforward. Hand and Finch do an extremely poor job with the Laplace Rung Lenz Vector, and their work on Hamiltonian dynamics is incomplete and largely unmotivated. The only benefit of this book over Goldstein is the introduction of Green's Functions, which Goldstein does not cover.All in all, if you want an undergraduate Analytic Mechanics text, buy Goldstein. Its more advanced, but more comprehensible."
1,Worst Semester Ever,"I just spent the past semester taking the course using this book at Purdue University. It was a horrible experience, the explanations in the book are poorly written and poorly constructed. There are no examples in the book, which instead chooses to lecture endlessly on about mathematics in a way that is entirely aphysical, reducing learning from this book to often be the same as taking engineering -- endlessly memorizing equations and how to apply them. I got a B in the class in the end, but only because I used Marion & Thornton's book in parallel.The entire semester, the professor said ""I know, this book sucks. Sorry guys."" So its not just me. Any professors looking at assigning this book, steer way clear. And a tip for the future: Any book that prints only in paperback can't be that good."
1,Worst book I've ever used,"Unfortunately, authors never realize that one of the most important things in a textbook is to provide answers to the questions. Not solutions, just answers. Hand and Finch give very little examples and there are no answers to the problems in the book. Also, this book is written as if you already know the subject. It is unclear, awkward and incomprehensible. I found a much better Mechanics book in Landau and Lifshitz. Don't buy this book!"
2,How difficult is to find a useful book.....,"Good material may be found in Goldstein,Taylor,Corinaldesi.Trythose ones."
4,Color problem,"The color wasn't exactly what was in the picture. But it is a fine sweatshirt and a nice color, nonetheless."
2,Remarks below,"I specified ladies sweat shirt. Also ordered pink one. Due to misplaced credit card, pink one was denied,and this man's sweat shirt was subtracted from a gift certificate. Ho hum! I've washed and pressed it, and will wait for extremely cold day to hide it under a coat.Must sent Amazon my new credit card number. Had to stop the misplaced one, and destroyed after finding.Helen S. Ferrell"
2,Don't buy this.,"This sweater is probably one of the worst things I have bought on amazon. To begin, the sweater itself wasn't bad. It fit nicely and it was warm and comfortable. However, when taking it out of the package it was really wrinkled, which was not a big deal but then I saw something that was a big deal. Two brown stains were on the back of the sweater. There is no excuse for stains on a brand new sweater. Hopefully I can get the stains out, but if I don't I'll be pissed because who the hell is going to want to wear a white sweater with brown stains on the back of it? To conclude this product review, I think that you guys should keep a closer watch on what your employees are doing while packaging clothing because not everyone likes to give the impression that they s*** themselves when going out somewhere."
5,very warm,"Nice, thick sweatshirt. You won't be cold in this one! Highly recommended for autumn outdoors work. I never got cold, even in 40's temps."
3,run small,the Hanes products seem to run a little small in size. If you wear a 3x you should buy a 4x to be comfortable
2,Typical Hanes Quality,"Not very good quality. Thin. You get what you pay for. Don't expect it to last really long. Good price, but not really worth the money."
2,Its OKAY.,After reading all the reviews and stuff of this sweatshirt i thought it would be the greatest thing i will ever wear. But it wasn't as good as i expected it to be. Its super warm tho. I was just trying it out when it came and i started feeling really hot. Its really good for the price however i would rather buy a crewneck from jackthreads for the same price or maybe a little higher and get a super comfy amazing quality crewneck...
4,Cozy and comfortable,"It's cozy and comfortable. The texture is also soft. If it were only heavier, it would have been perfect though."
5,Nice sweat shirt,Fast delivery and excellent packaging. Item as described. I am a woman and I bought this for myself and the Men's medium fit me perfectly. I am going to wash it in cold and either hang dry or dry on delicate or do both. I highly recommend.
5,Unglamorous quality,"I've been wearing Hanes clothing for quite a number of years. That includes these sweatshirts. I've found that they last for years, survive washings beyond count, and maintain their shape. There will always be a few of them in my closet."
1,Poor Quality Product !,I purchased this product as a replacement for my factory radio antenna whichquit working due to age & corrosion. The installation was easy except for the microsized power wire which was very difficult to strip due to it's size. The antenna leadend came apart on the third time of disconnecting & reconnecting to the radio.The antenna is now useless. The size of the coaxial lead wire is so small it is practicallynon-existent. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone. Save your money &use a coat hanger instead of this.
4,just needs some creative thinking,"The antenna is designed to be mounted on the windshield, but to be truly hidden I mounted it under the front dash cover. The signal loss was minimal, and works great in the city and most of the high powered transmitters in the country. The ground wire is 3"" long, so you really need to cut/splice to make it to a useable ground"
5,Works,This antenna does work but not in rural areas. I like the fact that its small and hidden on the windshield. I just wish it had a better fm booster in it.
1,Didn't work well for me.,The antenna felt and looked cheep...It is basically designed for placement in a window which defeats the purpose of a hidden antenna. All in all I feel as if I wasted my money... However I never did try and place it in my back windshield since the cables provided were way to short...placement of the terminating end of the ground wire is horrible..about three inches from the power pack making this difficult to mount in a window while not seeing the wires...
4,A MUST READ THRILLER,A mysterious thrill-ride for the suspense-driven novel. David T. Boyd deserves high praise for his debut novel. FALLING DOWN is definitely a page-turner... I hope this is the start of a series... so much more I want to learn about these well-crafted characters.
2,quick read,I read this book a few years ago and have just finished re-reading it. I gave it a second chance but I fail to see what is so appealing. I found the plot was entertaining enough but the writing style a little hard to read. I like to hear words in my head and the authors choppy and often convoluted sentences broke the flow of the story for me. Maybe the movie will attract more people to read the book. I look forward to seeing if Mr Boyd's future offerings flow beter.
1,"Poor excuse for a radio, but a cute clock","This is a cute little clock that is easy to set. The radio controls are easy to use, but the near station rejection is so poor that a single strong signal takes over nearly the entire FM tuning range. My old (circa 1966)analog tuned clock radio works much better."
1,Not what I thought,"This radio does have ecectronic tuning, but adjacent stations easily override the tuner circuit. It is a cute little clock, but not what I needed."
2,weird clock radio,"I bought this clock radio mainly because it is has digital tuning but I sent it back. Its so light and unstable on its feet that whenever you try to operate it, it squirrels around on the table. You try to push a button and it squirts it off the table. Its weird shape also makes it hard to grab. Its like a hard, slick football. You have to get up and hold it with one had and push the buttons with your other. It needs a more stable perch on the table."
1,The Black Perry Mason....,"Double Dead read like a ""Perry Mason"" television show. Maybe it was me but it seemed to drag on and on. I would check it out at a library."
5,"Fantastic, Enjoyable, Highly Recommended","I like a little (older style) country from my youth (Glen Campbell, Johnny Cash, Charlie Pride, etc.), but stick primarily to pop and a little alternative rock. I love Buddy Holly's music so I gave this album a try after seeing a special on The Nashville Network. This has become one of my favorite albums to listen to over and over again. I especially enjoy Nanci Griffith's performance, but the entire album is fantastic. This proves yet again what a staggering loss the music world suffered when we lost Buddy Holly."
3,True Love Ways,I purchased the CD because of the song True Love Ways. I really like the way the Mavaricks sing it. Buddy Holly is one of the best singers/writers and I like his music/songs. But I personally think the Mavaricks do a great job with the song.
3,Problem with NiCad Rechargeables,"This isn't exactly a review since I haven't purchased one of these; but I probably would if it weren't for one thing: this unit comes with Nickel-Cadmium Rechargeable batteries rather than Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMh). The difference is that NiCad batteries have less capacity, are much less environmentally-friendly, and worst of all tend to develop a ""memory"" for the the last place they were discharged down to, so that the next time you use them they will only discharge again down to this level, resulting in even less capacity. The commonly recommended antidote to this is to make sure the batteries are fully discharged before you charge them back up again, but this is highly inconvenient. Its hard to understand why Sony did not choose to provide this unit instead with Nickel Metal Hydride Rechargeables."
1,Too Many Errors,"This would be a great book if there weren't soo many errors in the text. Obviously the other reviewers did not work through the examples. When you perform 40-100 steps to complete an effect, and several of those steps are wrong, You have to figure out where the author went wrong and correct the method. Rather than choose examples that everyone can use, the author has tricks that work only for his text and images, so if you have different text or images, many of the tricks do not work."
3,Not many secrets,"The title is Down & Dirty Secrets but there are not many secrets in this book. Illustrations and step by step guidance to recreate the ""tricks"" are well done. It's an OK reference but I'm not sure the world needs another book of this stuff."
4,A PHOTOSHOP CLASSIC,"IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BECOMING A PHOTOSHOP ARTIST , THIS BOOK IS YOUR CHOICE , 80% OF THE TIPS WORK GREAT , THE EXPLAINING OF STEPS IS EASY , BUT SOME TIPS NEED TO BE EXPLAINED IN MORE DETAIL , NEVER THE LESS , A REALY GOOD BOOK TO BUY , ONE MORE THING , THE GRAPHICS ARE COOL ."
1,WAYYY OVERPRICED!,"This book should be a free ebook on the web since I can find most of these ""tricks"" on the web somewhere.Also, the so called companion images on his website aren't complete & don't help.He doesn't explain anything to you so you have NO IDEA what your doing or why your doing it, which means your learning NOTHING.His ""support"" won't answer questions questions right, they give answers that have nothing to do with what I asked which means they either Don't read it well or they are extremely stupid and should NOT be answering questions about the book.If all you want to do are the EXACT things Scott shows in his book with his EXACT text and images, well then go for it!But if you want to learn something about Photoshop and do things to ANY of YOUR OWN images then get something else.Seems the Photoshop worl just gave Scott some credibility cause he owns NAPP, but other than that, he isn't much and there are MANY BETTER such as everything Bert Monroy does!"
2,This book's missing some steps!,"Just bought this book, flipped thru it, tried the very first effect on page 68 ""Blending Images for Instant Collages"" and it didn't work!Is there an online forum or helpdesk for this book that I can seek advice? Or anyone kind enough to send me an email regarding the missing step(s)? My email addy is paul@lavivo.comThanks."
5,A Must Have,"This is one of the most helpful PhotoShop books I've come across. It's not for beginners, though. Kelby starts with the assumption that you have more than a passing accquaintance with PhotoShop and jumps right into showing you how to do some incredibly cool stuff with text, photographs, graphics, etc. This is a book to definitely have within arms reach when your using or working with photoshop. After reading it, you might find yourself looking at magazine ads and other things differently, and trying to figure out what PhotoShop tricks were used in them."
2,The title should be changed to Down Dirty Old Tricks,All the tutorials in this book are old and available on the web. The only good thing is that it covers a lot shortcuts for both MAC and Win users

Or anyone kind enough to post the missing steps here?Thanks."
2,my review,"I bought this book a year ago. I did manage to successfully complete certain tasks but in my opinion, he uses too many shortcuts. Obviously this book wouldn't be for a beginner. His sense of humor is dry and wasn't needed. This book would have been slightly better if a CD were included as well as a place to download the images he used so that we may practice on them."
5,Great fun. Not a rehash of the previous book!,"When I first saw this book I thought it would be a rehash of the Photoshop 6 Down & Dirty Tricks, but it's not. What a pleasant surprise. There are dozens of new and unusual graphic effects you can do, making if more of a playbook than instructional. Total fun. And you learn as you play. Make sure you buy this one."
3,Not Professional Enough,"The quick tutorials in this book are very nice and useful for total beginners, but the quality of them is sometimes not all too great.Kelby only teaches the very basic techniques - he never really gets into anything deeply, and doesn't show how to do stuff absolutely professionaly."
1,Architects data : The hand book of building types by E. Neuf,"New international edition from Airports to youth hostels, 400 pages of building types, Tables, Checklists, Planing data, Over 3000 plans, Sections, Diagrams, Bibliography, Reference."
3,A Little Less Hyperbole,"The reviews below this one seem a bit overstated in both directions. By my reckoning, ""Best Bet"" is not ""trash."" It is not great literature, either, nor is it intended to be. It is an entertainment and at entertaining it succeeds. I like baseball. I like history. I'm not a mystery fan. That is, I'm never much for trying to guess the details of who did what to who and why. But I enjoyed the depiction of life in Boston in the 1890s, and I enjoyed the baseball. The writing is competent. The characters are fun & colorful. Mr. Rowe knows how to write fiction that moves, and I would recommend ""Best Bet"" for readers who are looking for a pleasant diversion."
1,Bombed in Beantown,"The other reviewers must not've read the same book I did. I love baseball and mysteries both but this fails on both scores. The story is almost juvenile--anybody who's read even one Nancy Drew will know right away who the villians are. And the baseball stuff is extremely weak. The author I think is claiming the players and games really happened, but I know for a fact the games at least didn't. It's so easy to check and see he made them all up. Then too he's supposed to be a historian as his profession. What historian would have characters in the 1890s using expressions like being ""up front"" and ""its a wash"" meaning a tie. This is more like the 1990s. I would say for all these reasons its fair to say this book really bombed."
3,Locker Mirror,No plastic border around mirror. Appropriate for HS students but may be too sharp for elementary students.
1,Crappy,"I realize that it's cheap, but this is just terrible. Mirror is scratched up straight out of the package. And it's warped. Not even worth $6."
3,Scratches very easily and expensive shipping,"I ordered 2 of these mirrors. Both were packed and shipped well, however when I opened the packaging on the mirrors they both had tiny scratches all over them. When I tried to clean the mirrors thinking that they were just dirty, the soft cloth that I used left more scratches on the them. I would only recommend this mirror if you plan on hanging it and leaving it, not if it will be moved frequently. The shipping was twice as much as what the mirror cost....I would not order these again."
5,The Greatest of All Voyager Episodes!,"Quite simply, the height of Star Trek Voyager. Scorpion provides everything we can desire from Trek--wit, action, pathos, tension, danger, idealism, artistry. Captain Janeway's finest hour! david g"
2,2 STARS FOR EFFECTS,"The special effects in the episode werent very convincing. The 15 borg ships looked totally fake. If you want to see good Borg special effects, check out TNG's Best of Both Worlds and First Contact - these effects were very TACKY and FAKE looking! The borg queen wasnt convincing either. This episode didnt live up to expectations!"
4,"A Marvelous Score, marred here by Extraneous Material","As more than one reviewer has noted, this album contains not only portions of James Horner's orchestral score for the film, but also various period songs that found their way into the movie. And while I will admit there times when I do want to hear James Brown do Night Train or reminisce with The Young Rascals and Groovin', the fact is that I bought this disc to hear Horner's music. The songs are a major intrusion. If we get beyond that major quibble, however, we're left with some typical Horner -- which usually means, as in this case, very admirable Horner. The music preceding launch -- from the astronauts suiting up to going to the launch vehicle -- is utterly magnificent, as is that during take-off and orbital insertion itself. (And I for one like the inclusion of the prelaunch checklist dialogue.) If you can just get past the period songs, it's great music."
2,Apollo 13: Music From The Motion Picture,"Product is billed as ""Music From the Motion Picture"". My expectaion was that it would be all like the music leading to launch and the final scene. Instead over half of it is devoted to pop music from the early 1970s (..which may have been in the movie) and dialogue (not MUSIC) from the movie. I do not recall that there was a pre-purchase opportunity to view the back side of the CD to know that, and would not have made the purchase. I was very dissatisfied. The second star is only because the sound quality is good/correct."
5,best self instruction I've tried,"I have tried reading at least ten books on beginning guitar and always stumble because I don't know how things are supposed to sound or the tempo. This CD lets you hear and then shows the fretboard, it has made a huge difference for me. It also teachs a bunch of little bits and then puts them all together. Best money that I have spent to date"
1,Not captivating at all,"I was pretty excited about this product, the reviews were all fairly good. When it finally came, it was just a CD jewel case inside of a big fancy box with a cheap plastic pick in it. I used the software once and just completely lost interest. May be good if you've never picked up a guitar before, but definitely not good for someone who knows how to hold a pick and pluck a string. Speaking of the pick, it's all I'm using still - not quite worth the $15 I paid for the package."
4,I like it at the wide end,"For comparison I've used the Canon 28-135 IS, the Tokina 24-200 (I know, junk), the Canon 28/2.8, Canon 50/1.8, and Canon 18-55 EFS.The Sigma 18-125 is very good at the wide end, much better color and sharpness than the Canon 18-55, in my opinion (but that's not saying so very much either).At the telephoto end, there is not as much contrast as you would hope, but the colors and sharpness are pretty good.I like this lens at the wide angle, and that's what I use it for. I find I don't use telephoto so much any more, and I'm not sure I'd use this lens if I did. The 28-135 with its IS system is much better.The 28-135 was not wide enough for me, plus it is heavy and large, so the 18-125 is my current walk-around lens. I trade off between it and the 28/2.8.My next lens will probably be the Sigma 18-50/2.8."
4,Very good lens for the money!,"I recently purchased the Canon Digital Rebel 350D and decided not to go with the kit lens, despite its lighter weight. This lens provides a perfect wide-angle to telephoto range for most shooting situations. The focusing mechanism is audible, but it's not a HSM lens, unfortunately. I've have been very happy with the quality of the pictures this lens takes and have no regrets about purchasing it. If you're going to go digital, forget the kit lens and buy something with a little more reach and image quality. It's worth the extra $."
1,Doesn't focus,"After using that lens for 2 years, I had to sell it. It simply doesn't focus properly, and this is for all the lenses, not just the one I bought, as I checked others in the store afterwards. Simply zoom in onto your picture you will notice that what looked to be focused is not. I bought another one from another manufacturer, and make comparison over a month trial, and indeed the lens doesn't have a very accurate focus. Plus the range doesn't exist in my other manufacturers because it's not easy to build a high quality lens for a cheap price with such a high range."
4,satisfied,I love how the necklace looks! I'll admit it is kinda misleading in the picture. The black does fade after a while that's the only complaint I have.
2,Friendship Necklace,I bought this just for me because I love necklaces. I thought that it would come just as it did in the picture and it didnt. It wasn't very good quality and the strings were very strange and annoyed me. I cut them apart beause I didn't like them apart it just looked bad. They looked much better in the picture then they did when they arrived. I've ordered from Dan's Jewelers before and was satisfied but not this time.
1,Unprofessional,"I purchased this item, along with two other ropes for it. The item itself never came. I contacted amazon customer service, and rather than making the company be held accountable for their mistake they are simply giving me a refund supposedly. I would not advice purchasing this or from this company until they can pull their act together, for you will surely be disappointed. My recommendation would be to buy it off amazon from another seller, or try ebay, because these guys can't take their job seriously."
2,mediocre,wasn't impressed or disappointed. The medal wasn't really a circle and for some reason it felt really lame. I don't know what more to say it just wasn't cool enough.
5,AMAZING!!,"This necklace is a very wonderful gift for anyone who means a lot to you. I got this for an older lady friend of mine who I consider to be my greatest friend. She about cried when she opened this gift, its very simple, yet it holds a strong meaning for the wearer. She is never going to take her half off, nor will I. There are many friendship necklaces out there, but this one is one of a kind, and I recommend it to anyone who is attuned to their own sirituality and understand the symblism of the Yin and Yang."
2,Actual product not as shown,"This is a clever little necklace idea, but the actual product arrives as two separate pendants. Each half is on its own cord, which is knotted quite sturdily. If you want to put the two halves together, you have to cut both necklace cords and then get a new cord to string them on. Very disappointing."
5,Awesome necklace,"my boyfriend and i are celebrating our one year anniversary nex month so i orderd these pendants. i wasent expecting much butwere truely worth the money i paid. so much so that iv decided to give him his half on his birthday. The cord it came on however was to smal to fit over anyones head, and quite hard to cut. But i expected that from other reviews and just bought a black silk cord for each of us. i will deffinily shop with this seller again!"
2,Kinda Cheesy,The picture looks better than the charm it's self. I bought it for my cousin who is 34. He didnt seem to interested in it. My son who is 11 liked it. I would buy it for someone 15yrs. or younger.
5,YinYang Pendant Necklace,My son was very pleased with his Yin Yang Pewter necklace. I thought the price was a good buy. Thank you for your swift service. I will buy from your establishment again in the future.
2,Meh...,"I have to say I'm kind of unimpressed. The picture that goes with this item is deceiving. When I bought the necklace I thought it was going to be black and white, but it was just silver. The lighting in the picture really makes it look black and white even though it really is silver and gray.If you want to buy this so you can share it with someone go for it; otherwise, I would look elsewhere for a Yin-Yang necklace."
5,real legends,THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST CD'S THAT'S BEEN OUT ALL YEAR. I LOVE EVERY TRACK ON THE ALBUM. IT AMAZIES ME HOW THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE GAME FOR SO LONG AND STILL HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE GOOD MUSIC
5,Happy,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift for a son who thinks he knows what he wants. I was very pleased that the cost was very inexpensive, and the condition of the book was phenomenal. I was very happy about the delivery time, as I needed to turn around and send it to him by snail mail. I actually had time to get it to him before Christmas."
4,Good product for its cost,"This product works exactly as described. It installs in under a minute, and is easy to use. It is sensitive enough that the alarm goes off if you bang the glass hard, but not so sensitive that there are false alarms.My primary complaint is that the on-off switch is visible from the outside (instead of being hidden on the front of the unit) - so any would be burglar can easily see that it's not part of a full alarm system, and can easily be turned off. One work-around I've come up with for this is to place a large alarm warning decal on the other side of the window, which entirely hides the unit from view.For a sub $10 product, I am very satisfied with it."
4,window alert,This is a product you would buy but hope to never use. Im asked what would i have wanted to know before i bought this product? The information sheet tells me the unit will only alarm for 45 sec. after activation. I would want the unit to alarm for as long as the batteries last.This is a good product for security at the price paid.
5,I'm really glad I have this,"I am a single woman and I live on the ground floor of a condo building. I've got some hearing loss, and even though my 2 dogs would alert me if someone came in while I was asleep, I love having this alarm for extra security during the warm weather months when I crack the window for air. It is LOUD--loud enough for someone who has mild-moderate hearing loss to hear it! It doesn't go off for very long, but it gets the point across."
4,good product,a reasonable choice when you cant afford a full security system. It can make you feel more secure at night.
4,Safety First!,"I purchased this product for my daughter to place on her windows in her apartment. If someone tried to move the window, the alarm would sound and hopefully scare the intruder away. Luckily she has not had them tested, but has tested them herself to make sure they work- and they do. The only thing I would change is they could be a little louder. The noise can never be too loud if someone is trying to break in. They are easy to mount and you only have to push a switch to turn them on, so they are perfect for anyone that is looking for a quick and easy way to make their surroundings safer.My daughter and I feel better that she has something to help her to be safe, that is easy and effective."
1,Lovely but not functioning,"I was truly looking forward to this clock to adorn my garden. After changing the battery several times, because the clock would stop running within 24 hrs I decided to get some nickel alloy batteries. The clock did work for 3 days and now does not tell the correct time again. It's summer in Wisconsin. We've not even had humid weather. I'm disappointed with the clock not fulfilling its purpose. If it worked it'd have been perfect!"
1,Copper Wall Clock,"Bought this clock to see from my swimming pool because it was big. The humidity and temperature gauges are too tiny to see unless you stick your nose in close and personal. It was a major hassle to get it out of the box and put a new battery in it. Screwdriver required for all those operations.I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT THE CLOCK BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WORK. I HAVE TO GET OUT MY SCREWDRIVER AND TAPE ETC. AND RETURN IT. Real pain with all those screws! I've been sc.....d, well never mind. You get it.IT RUNS FOR ONE OR TWO MINUTES AND THEN STOPS DEAD. CAN I GIVE FEWER THAN ONE STAR?"
5,"Parents, Teachers, please read this book.",This book is an excellent source of practical and understandable information for families dealing with children with ADD. The writing style is such that parents are able to understand the information about some of the more complex issues discussed like neurofeedback. There are many other techniques for parents and families to use daily to help these children while at the same time maintianing a positive approach and building the child's self esteem. This is a book that any parent would want to include in their reading about the subject of ADD. In fact it would be a good book to choose as the first book to read on this subject. It will help to clarify much of the other information parents are offered.
4,Dread Champion,This book was great. I have read many of Brandilyn Collins books and have not been dissatisfied with any of them. She writes great mysteries.
1,no champion,Just do not like it. To descriptive. Very boring. Hard to enjoy it. Wish I had not gotten it. Maybe the next one will be better.
3,Rubis Tweezers are usually the best,"For years now I have only used the Rubis Tweezers & they have been the best. The gold slanted ones have plucked better & lasted longer, but I have not been able to find these. I am actually going to call/email the company, because I just got these & they are not working that well already, even just after a dozen tweezes. I may ask to see if the gold ones are available & I will send these back. In fact I will do that right after I finish this review."
5,Shrek 2 Good game,"This is a really cute game for the younger elementary set. My 6 year old and I can get through a game in 30 minutes, which is perfect for before dinner, or while his sister is in the bath. You MUST have seen the movie to play as it requires players to imitate characters from the movie. The ""battles"" are a matter of rolling dice to match pictures and it is very easy set up and very easy to play. My 3 year old was occupied with rolling the dice for me.One thing you need to watch, though, and it bothers me a little, is that some of the impersonations require players to re-create bodily functions such as burping. Trying to teach my children manners takes a backseat here. They get off track and have silly little burp-fests going on. It can get tiring.All in all, it is a good game and a perfect way to fill a half hour and spend some fun time with your kid!Go ahead, just make 'em say excuse me!"
5,Good Place to Start,"This is a very good book for novice to beginners who know how to use only the obvious features. This book introduces you to a good foundation of details. As the level of the book is Beginner to Intermediate,as stated on the book itself, you will need to read another book on Office 2000 for Intermediate to Advance skills. But this is a great place to start."
4,the master shows how it's done,Tony Bennett has such a great talent and winning smile. It is great to see him please audiences still and to inspire younger performers. They need to learn from the master. Today's young entertainers gain lots of celebrity for less talent.
3,Good,"Excellent picture quality, the Blu-ray is outstanding.Was somewhat dissapointed with the length of the disk, felt somewhat cheated."
3,Quick overview of duets,"I only own one of his greatest hits CD and the CD that goes w/ this DVD, both I enjoy listening to occasionally, but I tend to play more alternative style music. I received this DVD as a volunteer's gift and thought it was okay, just not great. Considering he was one of my parents' favorite crooners, is 80 yrs. old and STILL popular while singing old and new hits, well that's a miracle! Because of his quite long career this TV special tribute seemed quite skimpy. I did not see it air on TV so I cannot comment on the absence of other artists that were present on the TV show. However I did purchase my older neighbor a copy of this DVD for his BD later this month. I'm sure he will fully enjoy it as it hopefully will spawn memories of his happy youth."
4,cancel the CHEEZY dancers -you don't need em + won't miss em,"I am giving four stars because I dont waste my time writing negative reviews- so a four star review means I have to diss something. My stomach was turning watching the cheezy and totally gross dance scenes- feathered fans and top hats and canes- PUHLEEZE !! None of these vocals are enhanced in any way buy these gyrating midriffs with the same old sorry meaningless cliched moves and the horrific non flattering outfits- they look like pole dancers in an atlantic city off the beaten path porn palace. Have I made my case?Other than that the songs chosen were interesting, everyone does a masterful job singing - but I couldn't watch this tape again. These 2006 scenes just makes one all the more nostalgic for the neon lights of the old time dimly lit smoky jazz clubs when musical craft was king- I bet tony wishes that this style was still reigning as well"
2,the worlds most boring entertainer,"Watching tony bennett requires a lot of patience, this man is sooo boring that if he at one time didn't have a voice, he'd be lucky to stay a waiter."
2,DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!,"THIS MINI SIZE RECORDER GIVES YOU MINI SIZED PERFORMANCE.The specs. say it uses AA BATTERIES.I PURCHASED ONE AND FOUND OUT THAT IT TAKES AAA BATTERIES.IT'S SMALL SIZE IS IMPRESSIVE, BUT IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO HEAR WHAT YOU RECORDED? I WOULD STAY CLEAR OF THE 800 SERIES RECORDERS FROM SONY!!I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THAT AAA BATTERY DEVICES DO NOT HAVE THE POWER OF AA BATTERY DEVICES.SONY'S 500 AND 600 SERIES MICROCASETTE RECORDERS HAVE EXCELLENT AUDIO PLAY BACK.THEY HAVE A BIGGER SPEAKER AND USE AA BATTERIES.I RETURNED THE, M850V AND PURCHASED THE M650V.WOW!!! WHAT A DIFFERENCE.I ACTUALLY HAVE TO TURN THE VOLUME DOWN.IF YOU WANT TO HEAR WHAT YOU RECORDED? STAY AWAY FROM THESE MINI SIZED 800 SERIES UNITS.THE 500 AND 600 SERIES ARE ONLY 5/8 OF AN INCH LONGER AND OFFER 100% BETTER PLAY BACK!!!!!"
3,Good case...for a while,"It starts out strong, but fades after a while like a bad trumpet player. It's actually a very heavy case, as cases go, but it does have fairly good storage. But inevitably, the handle wears out and falls off. Use this one because it comes with the trumpet, but I don't recommend putting out money for another one. If you're in it for the long haul, you're better off buying a less-expensive, lighter-weight case that can take a little more use and abuse and probably has a shoulder strap or two for easy carrying."
2,Not worth the money.,"This is the case that comes with the Back Stradivarius trumpet. The trumpet was great, but almost everyone I know had the hinges, handle, or zipper break within 2 years. If you're looking for a good case, you can do better for less money."
3,Mixed bag!,"This is a strange album. Half of it is excellent and half is rubbish. On the excellent half is the Wu, who deliver a song so good I'm lost for words. Other highlights are Gravediggaz and Scarface. However on the other side Domino and Ol' Dirty will just bore you. A must have for horror-core fans! Otherwise buy at your own risk - I know you'll like half of it."
4,loved the soundtrack but only 1 stood out the most!!!,"When i first started watching this movie back in '95 i was completely drawn to not only the script but the soundtrack as well. I have to say whenever they played the slideshow of the kkk and all that other stuff ( which i didn't like because hey, im black) for some reason the song BORN TO DIE BY SPICE made me kept rewinding this part over and over again just to hear that song again. So that's the song that stood out the most and it went great with the scene, all the songs were great and edgy but Born 2 die just sold me completely!!"
3,At least it works....,Packaging is different. Emergency button is black/red not white. Ground wire is too short. Needs to include power wire. You only get one shot; an extra cable clamp would be nice. But overall this product is in working order.
4,dreamy and romantic,"If you are the sweet and romantic type this is your score.It's a mix of ""dreamy"" music and very romantic music (on top is the beautiful song sung by Jordan Hill). I think it sweetens everybody's heart."
4,One Hit Wonder,"I never would have expected a cheesy children's movie to have great music, but Casper totally surprised me. I purchased this soundtrack because I loved the movie, although I was a bit disappointed. Most of the songs on the CD aren't that great for stand-alone listening. If you're a film score buff like me, then you'll be appalled by ""Remember Me This Way"" and the ""Casper the Friendly Ghost"" theme. However, I suppose some people may find the vocal ballad moving, and the Casper theme song is kind of cute (in a very ugly way). The best part of the soundtrack is ""Casper's Lullaby"", which is the main reason I purchased the CD. It is also reiterated in ""Descent Into Lazerus"". This theme is powerful, emotional, and quite breathtaking. If there were any reason to buy this mediocre soundtrack, it would be for those two songs. I recommend buying it used like I did, for $1.99. ""Casper's Lullaby"" is well worth your two dollars."
5,Another Classic from James Horner,"Much like the film, the Casper soundtrack is very well done, and comic but a little melancholy. Most of the tracks are light-hearted and funny, and are more than fitting for the entertaining ectoplasms that star in the film. Casper's Lullaby is sweet and somewhat melancholy, a haunting melody that captures both Casper's friendly personality and the sorrow he feels that he is dead. Overall, another excellent work from soundtrack genius James Horner."
2,Used Collectible CD with scratches,"The item that I recently purchased only had two songs that I really liked. The music was OK, but I expected something a little better coming from the CD itself. I will definitely keep it as a collector though, even though it is a used CD. It also has some scratches on it that was kind of disappointing to me."
4,Remember Me This Way,"This album and this song is very special to because it was one of my daughter, Amanda""s favorites at age 15. She became an angel at 17 ( and probably a Casper)if she had her choice. This song is so special, I do remember her at her happiest and best. I feel a special closeness to her every time I listen to this song;and have a rare laugh when I think of their antics."
2,To Crown the Year,"This book contained little of what I wanted, which was making banners to use throughout the church year. It was more of a summary of why certain decorations are used in the church."
5,what a masterpiece,"This book is wonderful -- clever, sincere, brilliant, hilarious, and heartfelt. Ms. Harvey's poetic world is populated by strange and amazing creatures (the 1st person; the cake-like baby; the lovely, cold princesses) that draw the reader in and make us wish the book would never end..."
4,Great little compressor,"I bought this compressor to supply air to my Iwata-Medea Eclipse HP BCS Dual Action Bottle Feed Air Brush ECL 2001. The compressor is quiet and stays in place. A previous compressor I had in the past would move along the floor with the vibrations. The compressor is oiless, which is a big plus, and has a built in filter. The compressor doesn't appear to heat up nearly as much as some compressors I have owned in the past. The compressor is nice and compact. The compressor supplies enough pressure to do everything that I need to with my airbrush, but doesn't really give you 35 psi on the maximum setting. The most I have gotten is closer to 25 psi. It is still a very good compressor, however, I have to deduct one star based on cost versus value and the lower than stated maximum pressure. The price of the compressor is pretty high, relatively speaking."
4,What if?,"I really enjoyed this episode. It was a lot of fun. It's about a Maquis take-over (or is it? You decide). It has you constantly questioning, ""is this real or a fantasy?"" The events keep you guessing. Enjoy!"
5,sweet relief to bubblegum pop,"This CD is a complete listening experience. All the songs are unique, interesting and great. This is the kind of CD you can just start playing and listen to all the way through. Every song grabs you and singer Stephanie's voice is so powerful, expressive and beautiful, you cant stop listening. She is so refreshing as her melodies are so simple and straight. She is not trying to out sing anyone or trying to prove anything to anyone. This is a band that loves the music and loves to play."
4,"Great, original, a must have for fans of RPG and westerns!","This is a great, original RPG! I was really impressed with the entire feel for the book. They write with just the right ammount of camp and technical rules. However, it does get a little daunting in terms of learning new rules. If you end up liking this book, check out Deadlands: Doomtown, a CCG based on the RPG. Also a must-have!"
4,Playability of Deadlands,"Deadlands provides the players a change of the usual fantasy world of Role-Playing. They can recreate events in the mid-1800s acting like cowboys and indians. They can recreate their own western movie. The Deadlands world also includes a colorful cast of creatures and its own, personlized form of history. A must for role-players with a need for a change of pace. The game does have problems. Most notibaly in the combat sequences. However, character creation is fun."
3,Waiting for the sequel!,"Cold Hunter's Moon is a fast and easy read which kept me interested throughout. It is a very good first novel, and I am looking forward to the next in what seems to be developing into a series featuring Lark Swenson and Lacey Smith. Swenson is slightly more developed as a character, but neither are very closely examined in terms of their past or inner personae. It will be interesting to see if that is done in Greenlief's sequel. The plot was complex enough, the writing rather stark and somewhat choppy, but this may be a style which works well for this author. Characters were somewhat shallow, but that, too may develop with time. Good job for a first time out!"
2,Disappointing.,"I had a hard time figuring out who was the focus of this book. The characters were stereotypical, the dialogue unbelievable, and the circumstances contrived (how many times can two people be thrown together because the hotel only has one room left?).There was no suspense, because there was no build-up concerning the next victim. I liked the physical setting a lot, but I wish I had found at least one human character interesting (the dogs were okay)."
2,OK but somewhat disappointing,"Since I live in northern Wisconsin, I thought I would enjoy this book. Books/movies/TV shows set in small towns and rural areas all share the same flaw - the local police or sheriff's departments seem to consist of only a handful of people. This is so unbelievable that I find it intensely irritating. Other reviews have covered more of the flaws so I won't repeat them."
5,Kodak Easyshare CX7300,"I love this camera! I have had it for 5+ years and it is still going strong. It takes wonderful pictures indoors and out. The only thing I don't like about it is that the camera flash is very bright. Eventually I will get a new camera and give this one to my daughter. It does everything I want it to do. It isn't my first digital camera but it is my best one so far. The batteries do wear out quickly. I love the rechargable batteries from Kodak. I have only had to replace them once in all the years I have had it. I would definitely recommend this camera.Kodak EASYSHARE CX7300 - Digital camera - 3.2 Mpix - supported memory: MMC, SD"
3,Hardy & Limited,I find this camera a little frustrating at times because it is so limited when it comes to settings. It's horrible for pictures indoors but works OK outdoors. You can't manually zoom! That is something I can't stand about this camera.I often have troubles with the flash andit would be nice if the screen was bigger.I got this camera used so maybe this is caused by it's previous use but when I press the button it takes around ten seconds to take the picture. In a situation when I'm trying to capture something moving this can get annoying.I wouldn't recommend this camera.Some things I do like is how simple and easy it is to use as well as it's durability.I've had this camera for a little over two years and I've dropped it several times and have even gotten it a little wet a few times and it still works fine.
2,"Good thesis, bad argument.","Dr. Geisler believes in the bodily resurrection of Christ, and sets out to prove it in this book. His goal is noble; but his method is deplorable. He generally defends his position for the BODILY resurrection with Scriptures that deal with just the resurrection in general. For example, he uses I Cor 15 (If Christ be not raised, then our faith is in vain...) to argue that all who deny the BODILY resurrection of Christ deny the foundation of Christianity. In fact, this Scripture merely talks of the resurrection of Christ, bodily or otherwise. I am in agreement with Geisler's thesis; but his argument is contrived at best, and is not a reliable overall defense of bodily resurrection. To his credit, though, he does bring up some good points in favor of his thesis, but for the most part his argument manipulates Scripture to attack ""unorthodoxy""."
5,Great family movie!,Enjoyed the movie and thought it would be great to add to my son's growing collection (he's only two so maybe OUR growing collection) of DVDs. Love the digital copy since I can save it to iTunes and we can watch it on the laptop at any time.
5,Very nice for children!,"This product is amazing, I am Turkish, I got this product for my nephews who are living in Turkey and can only speak Turkish. My aim was to make them hear English, for the first time they watched it in English and then, it started to play in Turkish without changing any set-ups. It was interesting, then, they liked it more."
3,Okay,"It wasn't awful, but I didn't really LOVE it. I don't think I'm going to watch it again after watching it for the first time."
3,Up,Up: The advertising hype was more than the movie. The premise was good but the movie was disappointing for me.
4,"If you can ignore the emotional gut-punch plot, this is a fun Disney movie","Ed Asner as Carl the Curmudgeon-y widower is very impressive. Jordan Nagai as Russell is actually not too cloying. Bob Peterson steals the show as Dug (and Alpha). The history of Carl and his wife is a pretty painful pill to swallow, as is the amount of sentimentality constantly represented by the souvenirs left in the house, but it's thankfully balanced by the lighthearted comedy that the dogs provide.While I don't think the movie was great, the reminders of Carl's wife Ellie frequently somber the mood and often Russel tip-toes into ""too dumb to live"" territory, the lush scenery and Ed Asner being Bad-ass Senior really raise a run-of-the-mill adventure into something majestic. Surprisingly, there was no extra about what happened to Muntz considering he was last seen on the house.As for the extras, Dug's adventure is more slapstick hilarity involving the dogs while Partly Cloudy was a disturing tale of a psychotic cloud."
5,Super Good,This move is great. The kids enjoy it and so do the grownups. A movie for all ages! (Yes sad at the beginning but overall a good show.)
5,Wonderful quality for a wonderful movie,"Amazing quality and the only way to see such a majestic movie. Beautiful cinematics, and Russell Crowe plays his part beautifully. Every little detail is perfect and the bonus DVD is a plus should we ever be without a Blu-Ray player. Highly recommended. Blu-Ray is the only way to ever watch any movie."
5,"Inexpensive blu-ray combo, on top of 5 stars","Despite being a newer film and all the acclaim, it's a lot cheaper than the other animated blu-ray movies.If you haven't seen it, it's a very grown up movie which kids absolutely adore. My daughter loves the action scenes.Truly amazing, I had very little expectation after being disappointed by Wall E and teaser trailer looked so infantile, but man was I wrong. I am so glad they made the combo pack affordable so we could have blu-ray at our house and dvd and grandparents.also on a side note, studies show for younger kids anyway, better to watch same thing over and over than variety, as they anticipate what's coming and they learn phrases etc.. I can't think of a better movie to emulate and learn from."
2,not a kids movie,"Rented the movie today and thought it was only OK. Certainly didn't live up to the Pixar reputation like the Incredibles and Toy Story. It was rather violent for an animated film and there was no solid plot to follow. Funny parts throughout the movie, but I can't see a child getting into it or being able to follow it."
2,Nothing special.,"This film was not very good. It had some decent comedic moments that were given away in the previews and a lot of emotional scenes that children watching this film will not understand or care for. To depressing and other than the bird all decent scenes were shown in the previews, the rest is filler."
5,I find this movie to be UP-lifting,"Wall-E and Up are my favorite Pixar movies. My daughters love all the pixar movies, but Dad is really happy when they pick this one. Great movie with adult themes running through it. This doesn't take away from the kid appeal as Pixar is great about making entertaining movies for all age groups. The soundtrack is top notch, some good low bass extension. The visuals really make my panasonic ae4000u shine.Great movie!"
2,NO CLOSED CAPTION !! NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES FOR HEARING IMPAIRED!,"It is a good movie, but my wife is Deaf and can not enjoy this movie yet again (since we saw it at the theater) Also our Deaf friends and their children are excluded. This is a real waste of money for us. The movie companies are getting greedier and greedier.. shame on you Disney.**Today and email was in my box via the Disney store says ""The box states that it has captions for the hearing impaired, spanish (etc) and closed caption.""Well, the box SAYS IT it must be true!??(Tested on several systems)WELL THEY STILL AIN'T WORKING!!"
1,"DRM causes a mess, again. Thanks.","Beautiful movie. Typically Pixar. I actually went to a cinema to see it (which, here in Germany, is usually getting too expensive for my taste), and didn't regret it at all.Bought the DVD as soon as it came out - yes, actually thought the movie good enough that I want to see it again on DVD, despite it not being particularly cheap.And the DVD doesn't play, thanks to some DRM (Digital Restriction Mess-Up). It doesn't play, because it does not adhere to the DVD standard, thus (by definition) not being a DVD. So I paid a LOT of money - to get nothing.Thanks. Disney. Well done. Wish I could give you Zero Stars.Certainly an excellent way of making sure I buy even less DVDs than I already do, and certainly none ever again from *you*."
5,"A very great, yet depressing movie.","I really enjoyed this movie and have watched it several times already. It has some depressing parts but I love the overall mood of the story.The Blu Ray has a lot of extras that are worth watching. The video quality is stunning where everything just pops. It truly is a beautiful movie! Pixar did a good job and seeing the quality of this movie makes me wonder how great Toy Story 3 is going to be when it comes out on Blu Ray.I would certainly get this edition, it has a lot of bonus content and having the dvd of the movie is great as well!"
5,a must see,"Again Disney and Pixar together have made a winner. This is a delightful movie all ages can enjoy. A variety of characters' to love from the taciturn old man ""Mr. Fredericksen"", to the lovable mutt ""Dug"". It is an inspiring story about love, loss, and friendship. The quality of this BD brings the story right into your home, and with the standard DVD included we can watch it in other rooms of the house as well. In shopping for this item I found the prices ranged in stores from $35 to $20 (if you managed to find it in stock), Amazon provided a reasonable price and it was in stock."
5,The most romantic animation I've seen,"Anyone who has een this movie I have talked to has simply said "" I love that movie.""Up is the most romantic, feeling movie of any genre I have seen in the past year AT LEAST!Highly recommended"
5,LOVE THIS MOVIE!,"The movie is a very great family movie and i really enjoyed the extras, especially Partly Cloudy. And the delivery of the DVD was two days faster than the estimated date, which is very nice, since i'm not very patient."
5,great value,"All Pixar is 5-star, and this is no exception. The 4 disk copy was a real bargain at this price."
5,My Favorite Movie,"I saw Up in theaters with my honnie. I have never laughed or cried so hard. More of the laughing. Overall, Up is a cute and touching movie with a very original sense of humor. It is my #1 movie, and not just as a phrase, I mean it."
2,Up DVD movie,The DVD was mostly a very fine picture but half way thru the movie it hesitated several times. I grew concerned but it did clear up after the mid point glitches.E. Brosch
2,Un-Disney,"I had high expectation that was turned to disappointment. Great animation and Blu Ray picture quality, but no story. It did not touch me like other Disney movies have, i.e. Wall-e. There are scary and eerie scenes that are not good for young children."
1,Luxo Jr. Lamp ships broken...,Lamp is just flopping around broken at the neck of the lamp. I don't want to return it because it's out of stock from Amazon and I know they won't replace it. What a disappointment.
2,Meh,"I had big hopes for this movie following as it did on the heels of WALL-E. In spite of a couple of chuckles, UP lacked the charm, the plot, the suspense, the credibility, the music and, surprisingly, even the animation quality of its predecessor. Maybe WALL-E just set the bar far too high. One star for being 'colorful' and another for at least being better than some of the drek that's out there right now."
2,Only 3/4 of the movie wad visible on tv screen,As I viewed the movie I could not center it on much screen. Only 3/4 of the movie was vewiable.
4,louisjoh,This is one that both children and adults can enjoy. Owning this on BluRay makes this a great please to watch. Amazon had the best price for this.
5,Fantastic!,Wow! Who knew a cartoon could make you cry! My family and I watched this movie and were surprise at how much it touched our hearts. I highly recommend this movie.
5,Just a Terrific Deal,Got a terrific deal on the Blu-ray 4 Disc Combo pack. It arrived rather quickly after the order was placed within 4 days and it was brank new in it's original packing when it arrived. I love to find great deals on-line.
4,"Great 1st and 2nd act, poor 3rd act, limitless potential.","There are over 100 reviews for this product so I am not going to go over in detail the content of this package. Overall, I think this movie has one of the best 1st and 2nd act I've seen, with the back and forth between the two protagonists in the movie. However, the 3rd act really fell flat for me until the very end, where everything ties up in the usually Pixar form.What I really enjoy is the potential in this four-disc package is actually the slip of paper that has a unique number on it. Disney will soon release an online service where you can stream any of their movies, the way to get those movies is through that unique number. While I am not interested in streaming this through my PC, what I am interested in is that the APP they will develop for Ipad, which will allow me to have all of Disney and Pixar movie at my fingertip without storing them in the Ipad itself."
5,Lovely,"I don't know what it is about this movie that makes me love it so much, but it is one of Pixar's best."
5,Up,My grand daughter loves this movie. When ordering this movie it arrived quickly and was here in time for Christmas.
5,They told me I would cry.,"It's true what they say, you will most likely cry within the first 10 minutes. I know I did. Definitely the cutest and most inspiring Disney movie I have seen in years."
3,"First half is great, last half is boring","I haven't read a lot of the reviews on this movie, but I'm betting at least one says ""They could have made a whole movie just with the first 10 minutes.""Yay, then Mr. Dude and Some Random Kid fly a house to south America. After that, you lose me. It just stops being interesting. My kids only stay for the dogs after that."
5,Great Family Movie,"I think that it would be safe to say that all of us have that dream or ambition that is always before us--something that we've always wanted to accomplish. Doubtless, many may never see that dream come to fruition or so it may seem. UP embodies this reality but also touches on the fact that the real adventures in life may just be those things that we take for granted, from day to day, and the people that mean much to us. I highly recommend watching this film for the bigger picture of the story line."
5,GREAT MOVIE,So sad and sweet. Made me cry. Hope that I can find that in my lifetime. Such a beautiful story.
3,Ok,"It is a good product, and the person who i gave it was really happy , but i expected it was made of other material."
2,DVD Scratched Upon Arrival,"First it took a long time for it to ship and arrive at my house, AND then when it arrived I could hear the DVD loose inside the package. It was poorly shipped therefore the DVD inside got loose, and all scratched up."
1,instant movie,I was really excited to watch this movie. I could never get the movie to play. I will never purchase instant movies ever again.
1,"What kind of ""Deluxe Edition"" is this?????????","For an extra five bucks, it looks like all you get is a second disc that isn't even a DVD. Ripoff!"
2,What's wrong with Up?,"I'm sure most people will thoroughly enjoy this movie. But I found it disturbing from having gone through the experience of Grandparents and Parents growing too old to take care of themselves and the seemingly endless legal, emotional, and physical demands involved with that. Enjoy it if you are lucky enough to have not experienced anything like that. But for those of us who have, Up is torture."
3,Eehhhhh,"Although my children enjoyed this film quite a bit, I was less than pleased with this Disney' movie. I found the story line kind of depressing and not very engaging. Doug was the most delightful part of the entire film."
2,It same to the DVD,"the resolution of the film in blu ray is equal to the resolution to the one of the disc of dvd, is no difference"
1,TERRIBLE MOVE BY DISNEY - NO DISC MENU!!!,"Thank goodness I rented this movie - I was tempted to buy it since I loved it at the theatre and couldn't wait to show it to my parents. Unfortunately, my parents - like many people - are hearing impaired and there IS NO DISC MENU, NO SUBTITLES AND NO CAPTIONS. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?? Now there is huge segment of the population who will never be able to enjoy this film at home. SHAME ON YOU, DISNEY!!"
5,Excellent movie! Next step for Disney/Pixar animation,"This is a great movie! It isn't one the ""traditional"" sugar coated animated films that seem to be cropping up every week. This movie actually has a plot and covers some real topics like love and death. I've watched it twice with our 8 year old son and it is still a great time.The animation is incredible. The humans are still drawn very cartoonish but that helps with the story. The animals are drawn very lifelike and if you focus your attention on little things like the hair on the dogs or the feathers on the bird you will be amazed.The voice acting is top notch. Ed Asner plays the old man and he pulls the story along fabulously.Overall this is one of the best movies Disney/Pixar has put out in a long while.Bradman"
3,Oh dear - another blu-ray spiked by the powers that be.....,"Paid extra for an all region blu-ray DVD player that would let me enjoy DVDs from other countries. Worked a treat for a while letting me enjoy shopping on Amazon.com. Unfortunately, three of the last seven US blu-ray titles that I purchased have been spiked to stop them playing on all region blu-ray players from overseas. Fortunately this set includes a regular DVD that I can still play. This means that although I paid for blu-ray quality, I have to be content just watching UP in standard definition. I guess the message is clear. My all region blu-ray player has now stopped being an all region player for new releases and I won't be able to shop on Amazon.com for Blu-rays any more..... Globalisation may be all the go, but Blu-rays are going backwards on the regionalisation trail !"
4,Great Movie - Good quality,"We have thoroughly enjoyed this movie. First of all, the story is great and quite dramatic and early on a bit sad, but later on the old man's spirit triumphs over despair and the movie turns into quite the adventure.The quality of the Blue Ray disc is very good. The audio quite good also, but not amazing. We saw this movie in the theater in Dolby 3D and it was amazing, so watching it on Blue Ray WITHOUT 3D was not as exciting or I would have given it a 5!"
5,Arrived quickly and unscratched,"Fun movie and I love those dogs. Squirrel! My wife said we had to get it, so we did. Kids will love it later I am sure."
5,Great!,Came on time and it works! Don't really know what else to say about it other than it made my son very happy.
5,Great Movie!,"Great movie, that will be around for years! This is a movie that can be watched many times. It has its highs and lows, but has a introspective lesson."
3,Cute movie,"My attention wasn't continuous on the movie so I'm giving it 3 stars, having said this, I believe it would be a 4 star movie for kids."
5,How a senior citizen struggles in befriending a young boy.,A great movie for all ages. Adults will catch much more of the humor. Some places get a little far fetched. We shared this with a group of senior citizens and had good discussion.
4,Good Family Movie,"Humor, great effects, and heartfelt scenes come together to make a true masterpiece. With potty humor for the kids and sad moments for the adults, this is one movie I can't really find any problem with. A movie that makes me cry and laugh is hard to come by. When Charles set the house ablaze, I found myself yelling along with Carl, and when the main character was nearly slipping off the blimp, I found myself yelling ""Mr. Fredickson!""The video effects were amazing and tit was beautiful. A truly great see. I wouldn't buy it, but I would see it twice. 4/5A great movie for families. Some of the lessons kids might not get, but adults will understand. Still a great work."
5,Why did I wait till this came out on bluray?,I had seen maybe 2 previews of this movie and never paid much attention. I bought it yesterday on a whim and LOVE IT! I cant believe I missed out watching this at the theater.
5,WOW,"So this movie was with out a doubt a great movie for people of all ages and i do mean all. Now im not one to write a review and tell you every detail of this movie, you should watch it for yourself. However having that said there was a message in this movie that every adult can appriciate, and im kinda a sap but i cried a few times because it was so meaningful. Im glad i bought it and it will add to our wonderful collection. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
1,Frustrated,Why is it when they make movies that are in English but the subtitles are in French & Spanish never in English. Like to have this movie because I think it's a good movie but unable to because of the subtitles........There are bunch of English movies that has different lanuages but not in English and also no subtitles.
5,"Love this movie! So thankful for this example of a loving, long-lasting marriage in a cartoon!","I'm so glad this movie showed an example of a loving, healthy, long-lasting marriage. It's so rare in movies these days. It was was also wonderful to see Mr. Fredricksen open-up and reach out to the boy and stay in his life as a mentor / male role model after they returned to the city. We are very careful what we let our kids watch and we don't mind them watching UP. Yay! I love it!"
4,UP on BluRay,"Cute movie, my baby enjoyed the color. On Blu Ray the movie colors and picture exploded, it looked great! Plus it came with a dvd and a digital copy. I highly recommend this to anyone!"
5,Heartwarming and Wonderful,"Pixar has done it again. This movie has everything. Amazing animation, an emotional story, and wonderful humor. I recommend this for anyone! I loved this movie."
2,The DVD disc does not offer Spanish track,"When I bought this Blu-rey DVD combo, I thought I would have the same options on both discs. Apparently, the Blu-ray version contains all the options (different audio tracks) but the DVD version does not. This was not clear in the Amazon description. If you buy the DVD version alone, it does provide the different language audio tracks. I don't understand why that is not the case for the combo...just be forewarned."
2,Mac: Digital Version for a few countries only,"Be aware that on the four-disc version edition the ""Disney Digital Copy"" only works in a handful of countries. As Apple states: "" iTunes Digital Copy requires a valid US, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand, or Ireland iTunes Store account. Digital Copies may not be available in some countries.""Great movie, huge disappointment that I got a totally useless extra disc that I can't use for my iPhone."
3,"Yes, it's overrated.","Up was entertaining...at parts, but more or less a mediocre movie. Quite honestly, I felt like it was flat. It had a few funny parts...many of which they gave in the previews, but was no where near other Pixar greats."
5,Great movie for everyone,I love the movie because not only can you watch it with your kids but it has a greater understanding for adults.
1,No Disc 3!!!!,Prosthe movie is awesome!!!super cute and funny great for kids and cartoon lovers.great quality on the PlayStation. blah blah blah..ConsMy 4 disc combo was missing the DVD copy or disc 3 listed on the back of the set..Amazon is cool and sending me another one hopefully it come with a disc 3...why is this a problem because it supposed to come with it and i was planning on giving the DVD copy to my nephew and niece...But whoever Disney commissioned to make this set is a P.O.S.
1,Number of discs: 4....WHY!!!!!!??????,"Where is the Blu-ray version with just the movie? I loved the movie but the fact that I have to pay for 4 discs is garbage. If/when there is a Blu-ray version of this with 1 disc (just the movie) I will give it 5 stars.p.s. for those that are always saying you need to just review the movie, I am reviewing a PRODUCT: Up (4 Disc Combo Pack with Digital Copy and DVD) [Blu-ray]. Thanks."
1,What century is this?,"As a modern woman, I found the ending of this movie extremely offensive. Why must a ""man"" represent the explorer scout so that he can graduate when his mother was clearly available to do the job? And, on top of that, why is a child being rewarded for leaving his mother without even telling her, to go off on some reckless adventure with a geezer who for all we know could be a registered sex offender?I would not rent or purchase this film for my children, as I don't want them to grow up thinking this is (still) a man's world. Shame on Disney for continuing to issue propaganda of the submissive female. It's bad enough that The Womyn's Bible has not yet been accepted as the preferred translation."
5,UP there with the best in children's movies,Brilliant! Sensational! Exceptional! Words that tend to be associated with the name Pixar.In blu-ray format and with the surround sound speakers turned way up it was just like watching it at the cinema. The picture was crisp and vibrant and the sound quality was superb.The plot is engaging and the characters endear themselves to people of all ages.This is a story my children and I will enjoy for a long time to come.
4,up,"this is a cute movie, not especially for a weary 2yr old, he was a little scared, so we decided not save it for later :) it did ship very quickly and very pleased with the product"
3,"Stunningly beautiful, but wayyy too sad","Incredible film - especially on Blu-ray! The detail shines it's best on blu. POSSIBLE SPOILER: I don't like that this movie contains about 8 very sad parts - it might be just me. I wanted a fun and upbeat and happy ride - but about 1/5 of the film is just completely sad and depressing. Overall - awesome. Pure visual beauty throughout! Pixar rocks - looking forward to Toy Story 3, Pixar!"
2,Mixed Review,"I sent the DVD to my 4 and 8-year-old grandchildren after seeing the film aboard a flight. Simultaneously, my daughter showed them the movie (from Netflix). The little one got very upset at some parts, e.g., where the bird was imprisoned and when the wife died. The older one watched but didn't get involved. She returned the DVD to Amazon.I thought there were two plots: the one with the old man and his wife; the other, with the trip to Paradise Falls. There were a lot of adult allusions, especially with the psychopathic collector of animals. Check it out before you show it to very young children."
5,UP DVD,arrived quickly in great condition. Is Christmas gift so can't say about the use of the product yet.
2,"Luxo Jr. arrived broken, and we're broken hearted","Saturday night at home with the family, ready to watch Up on Blu-ray, but the lamp is broken, so we have to return the whole thing. I really hope they reproduce these better...."
5,Beautiful movie - Hopefully beautiful blu-ray,"To say the least, ""Up"" is a fantastic movie that has something to say for all ages, even for adults. I believe Up sets itself apart from all the other movies in the Disney/Pixar catalog.So far all of Disney/Pixar Blu-rays have had stunning picture quality. I am expecting the same for ""Up"" and hope that it's filled with plenty of extras, commentator(s) tracks, and possibly shorts as well.Still though, the movie alone is definitely worth a buy!"
5,Up,What a wonderful story!It makes you smile just thinking about the love that grows between the characters. Our favorite character is Doug (Dug)!!!!
2,NOT THAT GOOD,"I had heard only good things about this movie, but I found it almost boring. It did have it's funny moments but they were very few. I don't recommend this for small children as there is some violence with snarling dogs that might scare them."
3,"OK movie, nothing spectacular","I enjoyed the movie; there were even parts that made me laugh, ""Squirrel!"" But overall, the screenplay was sorta disjointed, and the plot line wasn't that good. It was a very average movie, below my expectations for Pixar entertainment."
3,Over-rated in my opinion,"This movie was heavily advertised and I was expecting a great kid's movie. We ordered it on demand for our 6 year old and had a movie night. I have to say both my husband and I were disappointed. It was amusing enough, but did not deserve the hype. My husband and I had the same semi-confused expression on our faces at the end of the movie. It was detached and weird, and not in a good way. The plot was great and touching, but the movie itself seemed scattered to us. I will say it was worth watching with our son, it was not worth paying for. I'm glad I didn't buy the movie first. If you catch it on TV for free go for it, this is a movie I suggest watching before buying to make sure it is worth it to you."
2,NOT a children's movie,"Personally, I loved ""UP."" I thought it was a meaningful, beautiful movie. My husband and myself especially loved the dogs!HOWEVER, it was marketed as a kid's movie. Like, Shrek, just because something is animated does not a children's movie make! My children are 8, 6, and 3. I may consider letting them see it around 10 years old.Problems:The long lost hero turns villain. And, a really bad one at that. He actually tries to murder a child, unacceptable!The opening montage... beautiful. BUT, a sensitive child will be very saddened by it.The boy's father *never* shows up. I don't care if that is reality for 50% of kids out there, mine don't need to be ""educated"" about that possibility."
2,Audio did not match Video,"The movie itself was excellent, but the quality was terrible.The words and mouths did not match up, which made it difficultto follow.I have never had a DVD that was like this."
3,quirky story that verges on very weird,"This film lacked the usual magic that I expect from Disney at its best. It starts with a nice premise - the lonely crusty old guy who will go on his last great adventure (OK lifting his house with toy balloons) who makes friends with a needy kid - but then it lost me completely with this strange subplot of adventure with this bad guy in S America wants to do bad things with the help of talking dogs. It starts sentimental, then becomes an action film. Just didn't click for me, though my son liked it well enough."
2,Disappointing,"After all the good reviews, I was awaiting a wonderful movie and instead saw a muddled plot and cliched characters. Two stars for the visual effect of the movie though couldn't stand to watch the entire movie."
2,"Expected Light, Uplifting Comedy; but NO","I saw the previews and expected a light, uplifting comedy, but was disappointed. It was sad and depressing. It was a well made movie, but just not what I was expecting based on the previews."
5,Awesome Movie!,"Awesome movie! Wish I saw it in the theatre but looks great on LCD TV. Good value - DVD, Blue Ray and Digital download from iTunes for about $20."
5,Great Movie for All Ages,"My younger cousins, my Fiancé, and even my mother all love this movie. Pixar has done it again."
1,DVD Was Not In Package,"My wife was very disappointed when she unwrapped this gift, opened the case, and found an empty case. We got the DVD case, but there was no DVD inside. Fail."
4,Up,"I got this for my grandsons who loved it. I, as adult, thought it was very good. It had a lot of laughs and held your interest."
2,Spanish??,Sure wish there had been some indication that this particular edition was the Spanish edition of the movie... never got to watch it and ended up giving it to the thrift store just to get rid of it
4,Better Than Expected,"Did not expect what I saw. After all, it's a Disney movie and I should not have doubted. A must have for any Disney collector."
5,The Menga's aka Up,"I Love this movie!!! And, I have not met a person that does not love it. The colors in the movie are Spectacular."
5,Animation for kids and adults,"My husband & I love this movie. We have watched it more than once and always see something that we missed in an earlier viewing. The emotion was so well conveyed and with a minimum of words. We can now watch the movie without crying (well, maybe)and appreciate the messages presented.I have ordered through Amazon before and am pleased with the promptness of delivery."
2,the bonus feature disc did not work,"got it for Xmas, but just recently watched it. but the bonus disc, which we paid extra for it, did not play at all."
5,Pixar doesn't disappoint,"I know, I'm on the Up bandwagon a little late. I just watched this movie and it was very emotional for a ""kids"" movie. It deals with a lot of issues - loss of a loved one, uninterested parents/abandonment issues, greed/anger and then ends with love. What a great message this movie has throughout it. Although it definitely evoked more tears than I anticipated!"
1,Unable to access captions for the hearing impaired or the menu.,"I am a hearing impaired person. I was unable to access the menu or captions for the haring impaired for this DVD. I returned the DVD and requested another one. I was unable to access the menu or captions on the second DVD. As a result, I was very disappointed in the technical quality of this product and I am not sure I would purchase another Disney product. The jacket indicated that there were captions for the hearing impaired. Is this truth in advertising?"
5,Everyone needs to see this movie,"This movie has more heart in it than can be expected from most animated movies. Heck, it tackles many of life's issues better than a whole marathon of sappy Lifetime Channel dramas and it will not wring you out, it will lift you up! While watching this movie, everyone in the room will find someone to identify with, from the smallest child to the oldest adult and anyone in between. It's one of the movies that needs to be watched a couple of times because it has so much packed into it. It's funny, inspirational, and even surprisingly sad (kids won't catch the sad parts the way that adults will understand them). Watch this one together...you'll miss out if you use this one to simply entertain the kids while you cook dinner. It's well worth the whole family's time and attention."
5,Great movie,Great movie. Finally a movie that appreciates the innocence of kids & puts a beautiful perspective on the value of life and loving.
3,Looks great - when it's off,"I was expecting something a little different, but overall I am happy with it. I thought it was a separate lamp, no that it was attached to a giant foot to hold movies. The idea of having your Pixar movies there is good, but eventually you run out of space. If you have all Pixar movies you will be out from the get-go.Then theres the lighting... When the lamp is turned on the top of the lamp lights up too, because the plastic is so thin. This means that half the lamp is glowing plastic and the rest is dark, as it should be. This does not IMO look very good, so I keep it off.The positioning of the lamp is also very limited because most joints only have spring action, but no fastener... So you can position it pretty much any way you want, but it will snap back when you let go.Anyway. It does look good - off - and I'm happy with it. Just slightly disappointed, especially considering the price."
5,Movie works great shipping wast fast my niece was excited!,The shipping was fast and was packaged so it came flawless. This was the one item my niece really wanted. Thanks for the great price!
3,Up Review,"Upon arrival of this DVD, I discovered that the plastic devices at the center of the interior of the DVD case (the ones that hold the disc in place) were broken. As a result, the DVD slid around a great deal causing it to be somewhat scratched. I do not know whether or not this was the case upon shipment, but it most definitely was the case upon arrival."
5,A great movie - more for adults than kids.,"Up is a great movie. It is more of an adult movie than a kid movie. Don't get me wrong, my 4 year old loves to watch it, but many of the ideas and themes are for adults. Being in my mid thirties, this movie speaks to me on many different levels.Get it and be prepared for a visual spectacle and great story!"
3,Not Quite What I Expected,"I never got around to seeing this movie in the theater. I purchased this movie and watched it at home. From the commercials it looked like a fun uplifting movie for all ages. They never gave any indication that the movie was very sad and heart-wrenching. I didn't expect it to be so sad. Not to mention that the villain was a little creepy. That part may be a little scary for some kids. The dogs were very anoying and so was the bird. Parents may have some explaining to do during and after this movie (death, cancer, grief, miscarriage, why the villain is shooting at a kid). I'm not saying I didn't like the movie. I did. But I think Disney could have marketed it differently. I think parents should view it with their small children. It's a very sad movie with a happy ending, but the events may be a little to difficult for small children to understand.The animation was fantastic. But the story left a little to be desired."
5,Great Move,Gave 5 stars because of great customer service. First DVD was damaged. The return was simple and quick and another DVD arrived same day I sent the damaged one back.
2,missing a menu,"The first movie that I received, I couldn't access the menu so I sent it back and got another one. However, I can't access the menu on the second movie as well. Other than that, the movie plays fine."
1,Draconian Copy Protection makes move unplayable,"I watch all of my movies on my computer. In this case, however, the DVD is so corrupted with draconian copy protections that I cannot even get it to start. Buyer beware!"
3,3D is not so good,"I have been buying lots of 3d Blu-ray movies. I bought this for 3d and was disappointed. Blu-ray.com gave it a real good 3d rating but I didn't see great effects or great visual depths. Picture is super clear but not so good 3d effects. As far as animated videos, I would recommend Paranorman(3d: 5 stars) and Tin Tin(3d: 4 stars. I wish Amazon would rent 3d movies."
5,Loved this emotional rollercoaster!,"This movie was an emotional roller-coaster, and filled with themes of love and loss, divorce, caring for the elderly, urbanization, oh my! It was a great movie, with lots to think and talk about with your family. Overall an uplifting (no pun intended) movie with lovable characters and a wonderfully unique storyline. Pixar is the BEST."
3,Blu-Ray Disc Failure,"We received this as a present for Christmas, but the Blu-Ray disc cannot be read, actually it can but looks like there are zero chapters, and our PS3 has the latest software updates available. Is anyone else having this issue?I have seen the movie in the theater previously and would give it 5 stars, but this isn't cool.. with it not playing at all.Gonna contact Disney about it."
1,It's time to grow up.,"Why not zero stars? This movie is fine for my son. I went and saw Antichrist tonight, and I was looking around at the audience and all of a sudden I thought about this movie. Now I saw this movie on a plane, without my son. My thought was this: I am tired of adults talking about how excellent pixar movies are. And then I thought about adults talking about Harry Potter and Twilight, and how ... good they are. Neither are that good, unless you haven't read Bram Stoker's Dracula or... well pick a book. I can forgive teenagers and pre-teens for reading these books, I can't forgive adults who seem to pride themselves on their appreciation of movies that were meant for kids. There is no literary parallel. Pixar is not to film what Watership Down is to literature. No. If you are an adult and Up resonates with you- then you are truly not grown UP. If you can appreciate it for your children that is different, but really - your kids don't need this. What I mean to say here is grow up."
1,"Good movie, waaay overpriced",Up is another one of Pixar's excellent digital films. The story was delightful and as always well written but for a single disc blu-ray movie $41.99 is extremely overpriced and down right pretentious. Good luck getting me to pay that price for this or any other single disc movie for that matter.
1,I don't get it,"I don't care about how many discs there are, this movie sucked. I expect more from Disney. This movie was pretty boring. The only thing was that it did make me sad at parts where the old man talked about his wife and there life together. My kid was not very entertained by this. Rent before you buy. We had looked forward to this movie for six months and we were totally let down. I don't get why people give it 5 stars."
1,Worst Movie Eeeeeeeeevvvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrr!,"Never buy this movie, or even see it, or rent it! This has to be the worst movie I've ever seen. The whole plot is sad, there are about 2 funny lines, and all the characters are weirdos. Mothers, if you are thinking of letting your kids watch this, don't unless they are at least over 8 or 9! I mean really, in the first 5 minutes I hated this movie, a tip for the producers, Don't start out with the saddest part of the movie. If there are any sad parts they're supposed to be at the end. But don't worry, there's more than one sad part. I was really looking forward to this movie because it looked funny and was made by Disney, WRONG! To think I almost bought this movie. Never buy IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!One last comment, dogs flying in planes shooting machine guns, WHAT is up with that!"
1,"No 3D, so they lost a sale ...","If the package came with a 3D version I would by it, very eagerly, but this is a complete waste to me. I'll rent it when it comes out on DVD/Blu-ray in Australia and then I will wait for a 3D version, but if it does come out in 3D and it is not packaged with the extras included here, them I will never buy it. So frustrating and so disappointing."
1,Disney Salaries,"Given the relatively high prices for Disney titles, I would like to know exactly how much is Disney paying these animated characters? These cartoon characters are making out like bandits."
5,Funny & Emotional Film - Good for All Ages,"I had been hearing good things about this movie, and finally sat down to watch it this past weekend... And what a GREAT movie.First of all, it had me balling in the first 20 minutes, but the movie really carried itself well, without making it too long. Secondly, what I really liked about the movie, is that it did have a lot of adult themes in it (death of a spouse, divorce, neglectful parents, problems conceiving children), it was still great for kids.Great story, and great movie :)"
4,wow,"This movie was a very unexpected one, but it was also very great. I can't say much that the other reviewers haven't already said, but I must put in one caveat - this movie is not for very young children. There is death in here (not just Ellie's own) and young kids might ask their parents if old people really are kicked out of their houses - Mommy and Daddy should expect to answer this question, as it is a sticky one for a kids' movie. For older kids and adults though it is an awesome movie."
1,No subtitles,"Without any reference to the quality of the movIe, the DVD version of this movie - at least the single disk version - is pathetic. When you pop it in, it start playing the movie, no menu. ""Sound"" and ""Subtitle"" buttons on the remote aren't responsive _ nor do ""menu"" buttons - and turning on SDH on the TV has no results either (despite promises on the DVD case). I expect DVDs in this day and age to come with subtitles, especially when they *say so* on the back. Pathetic release."
4,Good family entertainment!,This is a cute film with appropriate themes. I especially appreciated that the writers/animators understand dog behaviors so well. Everyone who owns and loves a dog will relate to the dogs in 'UP.' Recommended for families.
3,OK Movie,"Overall this was an OK movie. My husband and kids (age 6-13) liked it a lot. I liked parts of it. The beginning seemed like it was more for adults than kids. My husband and I had to explain it to our younger kids. The plot started to wear on me toward the end. It started to get pretty silly. But like I say, my kids loved it. I'm not sorry we bought it."
3,False information on Technical Specs,I bought the single disc edition and it specifies CLEARLY on the back that it has French (which I prefer) and Spanish tracks and subtitles. INCORRECT! IT HAS NONE. How can I contact this company and request my money back???
1,Language & subtitles problem,"A complete disappointment!The following has nothing to do with the movie nor the seller but with the information provided on the page.Personally I have noticed as Amazon does not always fully informed about the languages and subtitles available for a film.In fact and very often simply does not show any information, so I assume it is only in English, but in this case was very clear:Language: Franais (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), Spanish (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround)Subtitles: French, Spanish.But the movie is only in English and no subtitle at all.I think the company should put more care into these details.I even think that there should be an email option in case of doubt."
1,BOTH disc's are DEFECTIVE!!,BOTH DISC's are DEFECTIVE they black out through out the movie.. thought it was our brand new blu ray player but not the case. could have just lit a match and burnt the 20.00 plus postage.should have just went to redbox and rented it for 1.07.
5,UP!,"This movie lived up to its promotion, even my husband stayed awake for the whole movie - that means the voices weren't drowned out by the background sounds or music. Geat movie!"
3,Lack of 3D Makes It a Hard Decision,"I just wanted to say that this is wonderful movie. I completely enjoyed it from beginning to end and would recommend it to anyone.That being said, I did see this in the theater, but I did not get to see it in 3D. We desperately wanted to see the 3D version, but by the time the family was able to get together, all theaters had stopped the 3D showings. I have been looking forward to the Bluray release just so that we could watch the movie in HD and 3D at home. I am very disappointed that it did not get a 3D version released to disc, and will just be renting the movie instead of buying it. Very, very disappointing, Disney/Pixar..."
2,Dull boring movie,"I can't believe people actually liked it. The first 10 minutes of the movie will make your kids get up and go somewhere else to do something more entertaining like watching grass grow. The rest of the movie slowly gets better, and by the halfway mark to the end its a decent movie. If your kids make it past the 10 minutes they may enjoy the movie. Don't ever expect them to watch it twice however. I sure know I won't."
3,Up up and away from good,"I love the animation of this movie, it totally rocks, BUT the movie itself is pretty pointless. There's also a few gray areas:Where was Rusell's mom during all of this?What happened to his dad?How did the ""bad guy"" get to Paraside Falls?It left a few question marks that were never answered. Also, I think it may be a little too wild for kids. There are gun shots, violence, a small blood scene ( th old man knocks somone with his cane and the man is left bleeding), agressive dogs, etc. Just think twice before you watch your little one watch it.Just my opinion....."
2,Not Even Close!,"Monsters Inc., The Incredibles, Both top movies from Disney/Pixar. UP isn't even close. I stopped it to watch the local news and didn't bother going back to it. I found Wheel of Fortune much more enjoyable.Best part- I rented it by mail from the N...... company. I'm not out $20 for the Blu-Ray DVD."
1,Too Sad for Children,"This is a very sad movie - it's about finding your true love living happy and fulfilling life and then having it taken all away and in your deepest sorrow you chase after lost and futile dreams. In a way it's typical Disney where ultimate sadness happens (Bambi, Lion King, etc) -- but unlike those single sad scenes the first half of this movie is super sad. There are come cute/funny moments but overall it left me with a sadness which was the exact opposite of what I intended by watching a children's cartoon."
2,Stay Away If You're Hearing Impaired!!!!,There is NO MENU and no captioning. It's impossible to enjoy an animated movie if it's not captioned and you can't hear it. Pixar should be ashamed.
3,Caution! Not for very young children!,"For whatever reason, Disney once again resorts to gun violence to keep older kids entertained. There are also frightening scenarios involving dogs. Certainly, there are moments of laughter, and the serious subjects of aging, life and death are handled with sensitivity and respect. However, I urge caution before allowing children under ages five to six to watch the film. This story is marketed by Disney as a fun-filled family romp. The ads conveniently leave out the violence!"
5,Excellent!,Pixar has done it again! This is a great family movie. Humorous and poignant - I recommend it 100%.
3,a good animated movie from Pixar,"""Up"" is a good animated movie from Pixar but not as entertaining or impressive as ""The Incredibles"", ""Finding Nemo"", or ""WALL-E"". ""Up"" is a sentimental story with some adventure and humor but not a lot. Much of the film is spent just getting to know the main character. After a long first act, he does go off on an adventure in South America, but much of it is spent walking around. The movie does build, and has an exciting climax, but this is not among Pixar's best. Reviewed 5/30/2009 after viewing in 3-D during its original theatrical release."
2,the dogs are annoying,"This is a review of the movie - not the dvd or the packaging like most other reviews. The movie starts of very well - but once they house lands in the strange world of dogs and annoying road runner bird - it completely falls down. the dogs are annoying - no humor - the bird is goofy. I was very disappointed overall with the movie. ""maybe"" worth watching once - but not a classic by any stretch of the imagination..."
1,Rental version is lobotomized!,"Great movie, but apparently Disney made a renal version with no menus, no chapter selection, you have to wade through tons of previews for movies that you would never want to see, etc, etc, etc.Beware of used copies.Bad dog Disney."
2,Disc was damaged,"I purchased this DVD as a gift for my mother. We were extremely disappointed to find that the disc frequently froze in place, at one point several times in the course of just a few minutes. We were forced to skip a portion of a scene as the DVD would not unfreeze. Despite purchasing this DVD brand new and at full price, it was apparent that it had been damaged. I love this film, but the disc's condition was unacceptable."
4,5-star movie,Ranking only 4 stars because the bluray is not playing on my multizone bluray dvd player... Regular dvd plays normally though...
5,Great movie,"It's not what you think it is at first but it is a beautiful movie about life, adventure, and what is important."
4,UP!,I got this for my son a few months back now and he still watches it from time to time. He will watch it to the end so I would recommend it.
5,medium and subject quality,"I had no problems streaming the movie to my Sony Bravia and it looked great. As for the movie, i think it is one of pixars finest. It is extremely fun to watch and evoked more emotion than I would expect from an animated piece."
5,UP,bought for a gift. grandson loves the movie. He keeps asking to play it over and over. I would recommend it.
4,Love This Movie.,This is not just a kids' movie. It is one that anyone can enjoy. The disk works perfectly fine and everything was in great condition.
2,forget the weather band feature,The am/fm is fine but the radio is useless as a weather band radio. I received it as gift to be kept in my garage/shop area to be able to check weather reports before fishing trips. As a small craft boater weather reports are critical. The Weather band tuning is difficult(impossible) because of minute adjustments and faint reception. I have relegated it to musical use on the boat and beach where it works great. I don't know if that tv function works but I would not reccomend spending any money on this product under the guise of it being a weather radio.
3,WEATHER RADIO,"Pretty scratchy for a weather radio but it will do the job. If I had it to do all over again I wouldn't buy it but would buy a better radio. However, since I am on a limited income and needed it for an emergency radio it is okay."
5,Great radio,"Dispite what others have written about this product, this is a fine radio. NOAA channel comes in clear as a bell. Other stations come in without any issue either. Used it up at work during the recent tornado outbreaks here in North Texas, and it worked like a champ."
1,Terrible radio.,"At $25, this radio is still highly overpriced. In a major metropolitan area, with many radio stations, it can barely pick up 3 or 4 on the FM! AM/TV/Weather picks up zero. But hey, if you enjoy the sound of static, this is the unit for you! Headphones don't even get stereo output...come on Sony, it's 2006, stereo should be pretty much a standard today. Purchased this yesterday and will be returning it ASAP today!"
2,Don't buy it if you want the TV feature!,"We purchased this as a Christmas gift and just received it today. Needless to say I was more than a little disappointed when it arrived to see a sticker on the box that said 'due to the switch from analog to digital signals on Feb 17, 2009, this product will no longer receive audio broadcasts of television programs'. That was the ONE and ONLY reason we made this purchase - my mom wanted a radio to use during power outages that had the local TV stations. Save your money if TV is what you're looking for."
2,Just what I wanted!,"The Sony AM/FM/TV portable radio is exactly what I hoped to find, but had been unable to locate in our local stores (Radio Shack, Wallmart, etc.). I felt the shipping cost was a bit steep, but the sales price was very reasonable. I appreciate the delivery tracking information, and have been most happy with the selections and service from Amazon. Thank you!"
1,Not recommended,"Unfortunately, this radio does not hold a station well, nor does it get clear reception. I do not recommend it."
4,Sony AM/FM/TV,Really nice radio and receives TV the best ever. The only problem neither audio setting is very good....... Way too much bass on both settings.
5,PORTABLE RADIO,WE USE THIS RADIO ON BATTERIES. COULDN'T USE A PLUG IN RADIO BECAUSE WE GOT TOO MUCH STATIC WHEN THE EXERCISE MACHINE WAS GOING. NO STATIC AND EXCELLENT RECEPTION. NOT HARD ON BATTERIES EITHER
4,Very nice radio,"I bought this radio for the AM, it picks up the station fairley well cobsidering I am on the fring of the stations range. Would be better if it were digital. Thus, the 4 stars."
1,Not worth it,"I just returned this item for credit, although Wall Street's return policies are terrible and it took several different e-mails to finally get the return address. Also, they want the UNopened box. How can you tell if you like something or not without opening the box???? (1) It seems like a cheaply-made item, to me. (2) It states on the box that it won't receive TV programs after February of next year, but the advertising did not state that - otherwise I would not have bought it. (3) It started making noises and giving static on every station. So I would not recommend this item."
2,Digitally disappointed,"Sony ICF-36 Portable AM/FM/TV/Weather RadioSound was a bit static when listening in the factory work place. After purchasing this radio, I found out that it will stop working w/ the change to digital signal in June. The reason I purchased this was for the TV band in the first place. I have since returned this purchase."
1,"Beware February 17, 2009!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I purchased this radio back in March 2007. Clearly, it is 100% terrific. However, apparently I am going to have to toss it in the trash on February 17, 2009 when digital television hits the airwaves. A total pity!Incidentally, in March 2007, this radio cost me $15.44 plus shipping. I guess the increased cost is to cover its new ""antique"" status."
1,JUNK,How anyone can rate this as a good radio is beyond me! There is no channel that this can receive! Tuner is well below sub-par! If you can actually get a channel in tune it will not be for long! How a simple variable capacitor tuner could be so bad is remarkable! They've been producing this type of tuner for nearly 100 years now; leave it to SONY to screw it up. I've disliked SONY for some time and was reluctant to get this but it was cheap. BUT NOW... I'll NEVER buy ANYTHING SONY again regardless of the cost! Put your money in something else. A tuning fork would get better reception than this!
1,Disappointed,Not at all what I wanted! Company has been extremely difficult to work with. This was a gift for son and still have not resolved.
1,Really POOR DESIGN - hard to use,"This product is so impossible; stations are so close together that they interfere with each other. The previous Sony model that I bought from Amazon (a bit less expensive) had a DIGITAL READ-OUT so finding the station/channel I wanted was simple...unfortunately it gave out after I had it for 9 years (not bad). This thing is bigger, clunkier, uglier, troublesome and, basically, useless."
1,Horrible. Purchased two (2) identical radios. one (1) DIDN'T WORK AT ALL and the other did not run on batteries. BROKEN,Horrible. Purchased two (2) identical radios. one (1) DIDN'T WORK AT ALL and the other did not run on batteries. BROKEN
5,Great AM DX,"I got this radio from Sony Direct. It was a refurbished model but looks brand new. Paid $14.99 with free shipping from Sony. I was amazed of the clarity and sound. I was able to pick up WBZ in Boston (160) miles away, clear as a bell with minimal drift. The FM and weather bands are also exceptional."
2,If not for the headphone jack . . .,". . . it would have been a 5 star review. The radio itself is really good, and the reception that I got on all bands was excellent.I bought this to use at work to replace my battery-eating Sony SRF-M37V, and I must use headphones there, so unfortunately the mono headphone output was a deal breaker for me.If you don't plan on using headphones with it, I think it is a wonderful radio. If you plan on using headphones, look elsewhere."
3,"sony portable weather,tv radio",THE RADIO WORKS VERY GOOD- I DON'T HAVE MUCH LUCK GETTING TV STATIONS OR THE WEATHER STATION-SO I WILL KEEP TRYING.
3,Nice little radio!,The Sony ICF-36 is definitely a portable radio. The radio has decent AM/FM reception and the TV and Weather have poor reception. It also has a very basic design but that's OK for a portable.
4,Good little radio,"Gift for my wife who works in a large office building. Antenna provides ample signal for the chanels she listens to. The sound quality is ""not bad"". Plus the size is excelent for the amount of space available on her desk. Thanks"
4,Review of Sony Radio,I have been very pleased with the radios perfoemance - great sound. The on off switch is a little strange but i really like the radio. It is the best portable radio I have owned.
5,Very Happy with radio - was just what I was looking for.,"I was looking for a radio where I could listen to a tv station while getting ready for work. Also, I check out the weather before leaving home. After looking in stores in my area, I saw this radio on Amazon and after reading the description, I knew this was it. It is a good radio, the sound is very good and I would reccomend it to everyone."
5,Great Service,We were very pleased with the product we ordered. It was the exact one we wanted and it arrived quickly. It was very easy to deal with the company that stocked this product.
2,Close but I have better,"This radio is compact and sounds very good to a guy who has over 12000 hours of flying time.Yes, I am completely deaf in the high freqs. But the radio continuely drifts off frequency which is annoying at best. Because of this one fault I could not recommend this unit to anyone."
5,Great radio,"This is a good value, clear crisp sound, good tuning, no noise. I wouldn't buy it from Wall Street Photo, there are other places on the web to buy it from."
4,Pretty good value,"I bought this radio for my office as a space saving way listen to some FM music or NPR, and chose it for the brand. Sound quality is decent, reception adequate, controls are easy to use. Best of all it met the size requirement. A good value for the price, and it's not a big financial loss if someone decides to ""borrow"" it. I have not yet used the TV or weather band, but I trust they work well enough where there is reception."
4,No problems with this upgrade,"After reading all the horror stories about this upgrade I tried to find a suitable substitute. I have been using PaperPort since 2003 or 2004 and really hated to not be able to keep my records that way, I could find none that would work with my 64 bit Vista.I finally bit the bullet and ordered. I have had no problem with the program or the upgrade."
1,Lied to,We ordered this item. A few days later we recieved an e-mail asking if we wanted it personalized. If we did to call a number. We did. The next e-mail in my inbox told me that the item has shipped. I thought I missed out on the personalization. I figuer we could personalize it when it came. After a day or two I get another e-mail that the item is on back order. How can it be on backorder after it ships? I called and cancelled the order. The lady on the phone said they had another simular item. No thanks. A company that lies olr misleads can't be trusted
5,I like this stuff,"This is much easier for me to use than the regular cling wrap. The press'n seal does occasionally leave a bit of residue. No problem, I was going to wash that plate anyways. Other than that, this stuff works well and as advertised.Now the question is what to do with 12 rolls. Random gifts I suppose."
1,Picture is not correct.,Picture is not correct. No WYSIWYG. You just get a gong. No support and no stick. For my usage is useless since I will not make a whole in the wall.
2,False negatives,"The item seems sturdy enough, but it returns false negatives now. My daughter selects the correct dot and it says it isn't correct. The cards have not been used enough for me to believe that the dots have worn out so I believe the pen is no longer working properly. I'm quite disappointed.Great idea, poor execution."
2,Great...when they work. So not great.,"We have wasted a lot of money on these things. When our oldest received a Hot Dot pen and math flashcard set, she loved it. We were so impressed we went out and bought more pens and sets for our other children. We also bought the Hot Dots junior pen. Each pen broke. Having made an investment in the cards, we went out and bought more pens. Those broke too. So we bought more. Yep, broke. They work for awhile and then gradually start saying every correct answer is incorrect. Talk about defeating the purpose! I'll probably keep buying these darn pens to keep the flashcards from being totally worthless, but if you haven't started the cycle, don't!"
4,"Some improvement on last model, but a little more needed","This newer version is larger but easier to use. The red-light, green-light feature & the talking feature replace the incorrect ""buzzer"" sound that I found particularly discouraging. Also the batteries are easier to replace & are standard format. My 4-year old still seems to miss the dots & get negative responses even when she is correct, so monitoring is still necessary for the younger ones with weaker fine motor skills."
1,Pen stopped working shortly after purchasing.,"I changed the batteries, but the pen just does not work properly. Even when it was working, you had to touch the dot perfectly to get it to light up green. Very confusing for a small child! Plus, the cards are boring to look at."
4,Good For Short Bursts,"We've used this Hot Dot pens at our tutoring center for years. Students enjoy using the Hot Dots pen and materials, but if the Hot Dots session is prolonged, students can gradually lose interest.I like the immediate feedback given by the Hot Dots pen.I like the adjustable volume.I like the mix of sound and verbal responses.Occasionally the pen will give a false reading, mostly becouae the pen was not centered on the black answer dot. Because of this quirky response, it's best that children use the Hot Dots materials with a teacher or parent who can catch these occasional false readings.The pens don't look particularly durable, but they hold up to lots of use and abuse by our students. Most performance problems can by remedied by putting in some fresh batteries."
1,Don't waste your money!,"My 4-yr old daughter thought this was very cool. However, the pen only worked for about 5-10 min. Instead of wasting my money on another one or more flashcards. Decided to spend it on BrainQuest workbooks instead (which she also loves)."
1,Hot Dot Pens are a Waste of Money,"These pens are so unreliable. Please do not waste your money. I ordered two: the first one did not work so I returned it. The other one also does not work. When you touch a picture that is suppose to be correct, it says 'sorry try again'. These pens are awful for students trying to learn basic skills. I am a teacher so I really wanted this to be a fun experience for my students. However, my students were just confused with the red light always going on and saying 'wrong answer'. It was a waste of their time and mine."
5,The human figure for serious beginners,"I am very thankfully for this book to be still in print it has amazingly good pics tp practise if you are trying to learn serious art. The old print is hazy but for practise it doesn't, matter you basically need form. I will highly recommend for all beginners."
2,Poor quality,"This is a very poor quality for a book that is suppose to teach drawing skills. The illustrations that it refers to throughout has been copied so many times that the shaded areas are now represented by coarse dots (bad quality copying, like when u copy from a copy). How can one learn and understand what it speaks about if the examples it refers to is faded and poor?I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!"
2,Not for beginners.,"This book isn't exactly for beginners. There is a lot of text and it's hard to understand. It's easy to lose track of what the author is trying to say....As if they are trying to make the whole book sound extremely sophisticated. However, it does serve good as reference for a few minor things."
5,A Classic for Drawing the Human Body,"If you read knowledgable reviews for books on figure drawing, the two authors they consistantly recommend are Vanderpoel and Bridgman [Construction of Anatomy, to start]. He begins with facial features: eyes, nose, ears, lips and chin, and then goes into the rest of the body. Each chapter is stand-alone, so if one part of the anatomy is giving you fits, just flip to those pages. I carry the book with me, along with my sketchpad. In fact I have to order another copy because my mother, an artist for decades, is taking my copy home with her."
5,The Human Figure,A must have for anyone learning to or working on improving their drawing skills. Has been around for a while and that's why.
3,Somewhat dated,"There's some good information here, but it reads like an old university lecture. It might actually be easier to absorb as an audiobook accompanied by the appropriate illustrations. Still a good reference for charcoal figure drawing."
5,Great book for beginners,"This book is excellent for beginners I think. For more advanced artist it must be very good book for practice. Human figure drawing is broke down in couple parts - starts with eyes and all other facial features, than continues with torso, arms, legs and hands. Finally there are nice drawings of complete figure. This book will help you to understand how the face and body are constructed. I gave this book 5 stars because of the value of the information, but it has one disadvantage - pictures look like 10-th copy of another copy. I would probably appreciate more bigger pictures too. There is a lot of text to read in this book."
4,Good for beginner to lear drawing human figure,It is simple and easy to read book to help artist to have a general understand of the human body. There are good sample drawings with the text.
3,Not for everyone,"Nelson Shanks refers to the illustrations of this book as examples of simplifying the human form into patterns of light and dark. While the illustrations do accomplish this, the book is by no means a reference manual for rendering the human body. Also, most of the illustrations appear washed out in my copy of this book. If you are interested in beautiful examples of sensitive charcole renderings of the human figure, this book is outstanding. If you want a visual reference work on the under-structures of the human form, you can find better books than this one.For anatomical reference, I highly recommend: ""Bridgman's Complete Guide to Drawing From Life"" by George B. Bridgman, and ""The Human Figure: An Anatomy for Artists"" by David K. Rubins."
3,A beginner,To explain my rating of 3....I bought this book because I wanted to start from scratch in drawing the humna form. I can draw but have no figure training. This book is beautiful but a bit advanced. It may help me out when I get more experience. Buy this if you are an intermediate or above but not for starting out.
3,"Skip it, some good drawings, the text is from medical school","I belive artists are mostly visual people, the anatomical descriptions are very difficult to follow, unless perhaps you have been to medschool. Pluses are the drawings, the size, and the price"
1,Can't have fun or rate it when it's NOT HERE!,"I haven't seen my game yet! Where is my ""The Legend of Zelda - Classic NES Series for my Gameboy Advance?! It has been over a week and it was to be here 9/6/12."
3,This game is Ok,"This game is OK, like if I did live back in the 80s I might of given this game a better review since when I play games I like them to be realy special. There were some flaws in this game like you can only buy one potion at once and to save you have to kill yourself like when I have to do something else I have to like get some enimies to kill me. But there were some good things about this game, like for its time and now the world map was big with alot to explore and dungens to explore. I think Ganon was way to easy though but hey this was an 80s game so it was about what you could expect. I would recomend renting this game."
5,ZELDA....The BEST Game EVER!!!,"I have been waiting for Zelda to come out on GBA forever. A few years back, I went out and purchased an old school NES system just so that I could play the original Zelda. Now I don't have to pull out the NES and take 20 minutes blowing the dust off of the cartridge to get it to work. I can just pop it into my GBA and go. Thanks NINTENDO! By the way, for all of you that are complaining about the cartridge costing $19.99, if you think back to 1986, the original Zelda cartridge was also $19.99. It's been 18 years and it isn't a penny more! If the GBA cartridge would had been GOLD, it would have been the cherry on top."
5,A classic game now portable,"The Legend of Zelda is one of my favorite NES games and now you can play it anywhere on the GBA. You can tell that this game is good because it is still alot of fun after all these years. I was fortunate to find this on sale the week it came out so even despite that, the price tag overall seems fair for such a great game although I don't think some of the other classic NES games are worth that price. Overall, if your a Zelda fan who wants to remember a great game or even if you've never played this before, you owe it to yourself to give this a try."
4,Finally!!!!,I used to play this game all the time. I was only 7(it was 1996) at the time but I had almost beat the game but on the sencond to the last battle it blew out. I was devistated. So we sold all the games and the system that bearly worked for a new PS. But now that I'm 15 I can enjoy the real glory of the game. I well be getting the game in a few hours but I remember all the tricks and how to fight. I give this great game 5 stars! Two thumbs up! ^_^
2,only a collectors item,this is not the zelda we see to day lacks story for the time it probably had alot of imagination but comparing it to the zelda we see today it serverly lacks it this is a good piece of history but not a brilliant game the gameplay is too simplistic and there are no villiages just feels like one long and boring battle its hard to save and once you die you end up back at the beginning
4,Entertaining,I enjoyed reading this novel! It was a little predictable but the storyline maintained my interest. I'm looking forward to reading the second novel.
3,Sister Circle,"Okay, I bought this book because it was on sale and its premise reminded me of Penelope Stokes books. And when I started it, I was not sure I would finish it. But then I started to care about the characters and I do want to know what happens to them. I cared enough to buy the rest of the series lol although I plan to donate the set to my church library."
4,There's nothing like sisters!,"I read this on my Kindle and wanted to be able to share it with my ""sisters"", so I bought the hard copy and the next two in the series. The ""sister"" I shared it with is waiting for the second in the series and another ""sister"" is waiting for the first one when I get it back. The characters are wonderful - we all know people like them, or are one of them."
4,The Sister Circle (The Sister Circle Series #1),Any and all of the sister books are entertaining. I recommend them to anyone. Four stars go to this one.
4,A good read,This was a good book from start to end. I enjoyed the story and the way it read. I would recommend to friends
4,This was a gift for a friend.,"This book was purchased as a gift for a friend, so even though I only read a few pages to make a decision as to whether she would enjoy it, in those few pages, I could see that the book is well written, with enjoyable characters."
5,Very Nice Read,"The Sister Circle was a very interesting read. It explained how each of us, from different paths can help one another through our trails and tribulations. I'm looking forward to reading the full series."
3,Feel good read,"This was kind of a life time movie in book form. An ok, easy read but not my favorite ever"
4,Great Sense of Friendship,"When I first discovered The Sister Circle series at my local library, I knew I would enjoy it. The book joins a group of women all fighting an inner war into a beautiful home and results in lifelong friendships and relationships being formed. We get more than just a glimpse into each character's life and are lucky enough to be able to learn about each personality, quirk, and hope these women have. At times humorous, sad, and even somewhat frustrating (especially with Tessa)the word of God is always prevelent and always inspiring. A great read!"
2,The Sister Circle,"I am in the midst of reading, THE SISTER CIRCLE, #1 and am still not sure how I am feeling about the book. It should state in it's preview that it is a Christian book and that the potential reader should be aware of that, if that is a concern. It is a concern for me and I am skipping over those areas that I am uncomfortable about. The characters are hard to follow and I usually need to go back a few pages in my reader to see what was happening prior to where I have bookmarked. So all in all, I would rate this book a 2 out of 5 stars. I will probably skip most of it and just go to the ending to see how it all turns out. I will not order another in this series."
5,The Sister Circle,"I found The Sister Circle and excellent book. The premise of sharing her home, hit me strongly. I was also by the faith in God that ran through it. It was a good read and it gave me pause to think about my own relationships and circumstances. I highly recommend it."
5,Surrendered To God,"""When Evelyn Peerbaugh hung the ancient sign in front of her house, she had no idea how life was about to change.In a matter of days she became the newly widowed owner of a busy boardinghouse, trying to cope with the lives and emotions of the most incompatible group of women ever gathered under one roof.As the women settle into their roles at Peerbaugh Place, they discover the true meaning of friendship... and the joy of lives tryly SURRENDERED TO GOD.""[from the book of the back cover]"
5,Informative :),"Everyone should read this book and understand how the Bible came to be. It has increased my faith, given me a greater appreciation for the Word of Yah I hold dear in my hands, and has inspired me to do much more research into many of the topics discussed in this book (particularly the Apostolic Father's and early church fathers)."
4,Easy riders,I have to work in an enviroment where you have to stand a good part of the day and these shoes make it all the better.
1,"Nautilus Men's 1320 steel toe sneaker, (Shoe Width Review)","My husband wears a 4E width shoe, which is extremely hard to find in a steel toed shoe. I ordered this item in a 4E width, but when we received the sneakers, my husband tried them on and they were extremely tight. I double checked the width and the label says XXW. So be advised, XXW is not a true 4E. I had to return and very disappointed."
4,OUCH! NOT as described...,"Nautilus Men's 1320 Steel Toe Lace-Up Sneaker,Grey,9.5 XXWThis shoe size, xxw, was described to fit almost like a 5x?? Sorry DOES NOT! Shoe was just too tight when FIRST put on out of the box. Way tighter than the Steel-Toe boots I am using right now when I first put them out of the box...and these boots were given an xw width(that was the brands widest)and curiously, fit better than other brand boots in that shop given 3e widths?? For some people...the PAIN of breaking-in steel toe boots or shoes can be pretty bad, almost excruciating to walk in.Although, the shoe was very well made and when I first saw them I was very pleased. Until I tried them on! Great looking shoe just beware of the width described. This is why I gave them 4 stars for the quality, and a big F-minus on description of width! Obviously I had to return the shoes and go through that process(hassle)immediately."
2,Nautilus safety shoes,"I got ""in emergency"" one pair.The shoes are comfortable as a sneaker and you can use all day without problems.I got positive experience.The only negative experience was strange smell comes from new shoes.With regret also I found that is not protecting me from heat radiation and other dangerous things during my work.My opinion is that my purchase is not suitable for my work.Can be used only in limited work areas not in area with risk environment."
3,Fit great,Good fit and looks but after only 4 months the side of the shoe on my right foot has split out.
3,"A worthwhile read, but older information.","This is a pretty good book, but the information is a bit outdated. These days more importance should be placed on things like roller cams and fuel injection.But for the basics of building a good short block and for the backyard mechanic, it's a pretty solid book."
5,Henry Slaughter Gospel Piano Book 4,I am very pleased with my purchase. The book is 'as new'.Thank you.
5,"Rumpole's Most Famous Case, At Long Last","Long time readers of the memoirs of Horace Rumpole as John Mortimer has provided them know that the Penge Bungalow Murders was the case that made Rumpole famous and established him in his career as defender of the defenseless at the Old Bailey and other British courts. Rumpole refers to the Penge Bungalow Affair throughout his reminiscences of other trials, but up until now we have not known exactly what happened and why it made Rumpole so famous.Now we have the full story at last. Not only did the Penge Bungalow Murders lead to Rumpole's illustrious career, it also led to his introduction to She Who Must Be Obeyed: his future wife Hilda, daughter of Rumpole's Head of Chambers C.H. Wystan. Furthermore, the case itself is a most satisfying little mystery that will leave you guessing up to the very end. I hope that other early Rumpole triumphs will soon follow."
4,Wonderful!!!!!!!!!,"The Rumpole books are great!! My father and I adore Horace!!! We look forward to reading them when they are published!!We also enjoy the tv series of this character! Alas, the actor died, but if you like these books, you will love the british series too! I absolutely love ""She who must be obeyed""!!! Funny books. Hope to continue reading Rumpole books!!My opinion... Read all of John Mortimer's Rumpole books!!!!"
3,A bit Disapointing,"I'm always glad to read a new Rumpole story. This one however seemed very lightweight to carry a book. Rumpole always boasted of his great early success in winning ""the Penge Bungalow murders"" alone and without a leader. There had also been many allusions to his expertise with ""bloodstains"" displayed in the case. The actual story seemed too simple and did not hinge on bloodstains. I also began to wonder if Mortimer is losing his grip when he awarded C H Wystan, Rumpole's father-in-law, a posthumous QC. Previous stories have alluded to the fact that Wystan had never quite measured up to that achievement. Rumpole at one time fibbed to Hilda, that the lord chancellor had decided to award ""daddy"" that honor, but he'd had died before they could do so. Perhaps as head of chambers, Ballard and Wystan have become confused in both Rumpole's and Mortimer's minds."
3,Rumpole and the Big Letdown,"At last we faithful readers get to learn first hand what it is that Rumpole has teasingly described in each of his many tales. Unfortunately, this reader was left with a nagging suspicion that perhaps his hero tended to exagerate the signifigance of the famous Penge Bungalow murders where he defended alone and without a leader. We knew, for instance, that he became an expert on blood splatter patterns which was crucial to the successful defense of the case. Unfortunately, it appears at the time that the signifigance of the blood splatter pattern did not require much expertise after all. Can it be that Rumpole has mislead us about other things in his fabled past? At least Dr. Watson had the good sense to merely tell us the title of many of Holmes' early successes, and didn't see the need to actually report them lest we be similarly disappointed by the reality."
2,Mistake,"The book is a mistake. The Penge Bungalow Murders have been made legendary in the Rumpole universe. The problem is the case, and Rumpole's handling of it is absolutely ordinary. There is no reason that this should be his proudest moment. It follows the structure of many of Rumpole's cases. Incompetent leader, Rumpole helps muscle him of the case and takes it himself. The view of a young Rumpole is delightful, although the description in another Rumpole story of himself then as a young barrister he is not at all sure he would like doesn't seem to apply. It would have been a fined thing to see a young Rumpole, but the Penge Bungalow Murders should have been left out. It is like when a friend talks up a movie as the greatest thing he's ever seen for years, and when you see it...... it is just ordinary."
4,Satisfying as always.,"I have long been a Rumpole fan, and it was fun to finally read the story of the case that launched his career. As always, John Mortimer's light touch and sly humor were a delight."
3,"same old, same good","i love the rumpole series and the wonderful tongue-in-cheek writing. i listened to a lot of the rumpole stories on c-d, with the wonderful, rumbling narration by leo kern, and wish i could get my hands on more.it's never a waste of time to read rumpole."
3,Good short story; mediocre novel,"I have been away from the Rumpole stories for quite a while, so I missed the initial publication of this novel. I was intrigued, because of the continuing references to the Penge Bungalo murders throughout the series. And, it was good to finally learn what this case was all about. However, John Mortimer stretched a good story into a novel which lacks punch. The story develops too slowly, and when the denoument finally comes, it's almost anticlimactic. To be sure, Rumpole also reveals information about his courtship with ""She Who Must Be Obeyed,"" and why she must be obeyed. If you want to fill in some of the gaps in the Rumpole lore, get the book. If you want a good read, stick with the short stories."
5,Rumpole and the Penge Bungalow Murders,This was a really interesting book and introduced all the characters and explained the motives and reasons behind a lot of different people in the following stories. I first saw Rumpole on televison and have found these books to be challenging and fascinating. Thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Has given me a whole new appreciation of the law and of the power of poetry.
4,"At last, Penge Bungalow is no longer a mystery.","Throughout the many Rumpole stories, there is frequent mention of his triumph in the Penge Bungalow Murder trial. Until now it has piqued the curiosity but raised a thirst that could not be slaked. No more thirst,the story has finally been told.John Mortimer is a master of description of his characters, a gift lost in the television abbreviation of Rumpole. His descriptions are entertaining and strike many familiar chords. They add immensely to the enjoyment of the stories, and would even be worth reading without the stories. The stories, however, are also excellent.All Rumpole is worth reading more than once."
4,Rumpole - the prequel.,"I've long been a Rumpole fan.But when I got Penge Bungalow, it took me a while to read.Perhaps it was knowing that this book would never be made into a film (because the writer playing Rumpole had died).The book was well written and the plot funny and believable - typical Mortimer.I enjoyed it a lot.It gave me better understanding of Rumpole's relationship with Uncle Tom.Book's definitely worth reading."
2,Missing parts. Merry Christmas!!,So I ordered this for my husband for Christmas and in the process of putting it together we find it is missing parts. Important parts. Like the scope and the scope mount. Merry Christmas. It's a great looking sciope. Too bad I can't review it any further!! If you buy one don't put it together until you lay out the parts and make sure they are all there because the set up and take down took hours.
3,"Ok, but I thought it had more food","Not bad for making the dishes, but did not care for the girl. She is getting a ""big head"". I think if she becomes more humble, she may make some better cooking vid's. The other kids were nice."
3,"Great, definitely worth the listen","This cd has a variety for every occasion. The party mood, the club mood, chilling/mello mood, etc. Granted it is not their best effort (Diary Of A Mad Band is certainly a better selection) but it is not bad, the biggest flaw by far in this cd are the annoying 11 skits! It drugged the album therefore it was DOA. But it is worth the listen, I suggest buying a used copy."
3,JODECI AT THEIR FREAKIEST!,"Jodeci's third album THE SHOW, THE AFTER PARTY, THE HOTEL can be compared to their debut album FOREVER MY LADY very much. The song ""Love U 4 Life"" can be, in a way, mistaken for the title track from their debut album. Unfortunately, FOREVER MY LADY and THE SHOW, THE AFTER PARTY, THE HOTEL both have very insignificant fast songs!Jodeci really shows their sexual side in the hotel half of the album (tracks 12-22). When you buy this album, I suggest sticking to this half because like I always say Jodeci is at their best with slow songs! Jodeci could have done with about six interludes instead of the nearly overwhelming eleven!"
3,Hmmm,"Boy was I surprised as a high schooler to hear track # 13. Haha! There are too many interludes on here but as far as song quality goes, these are good tunes. If you want a sexual-horn dog CD, buy this one. ""Get On Up"" and ""Love You For Life"" are really the only ~non-sexual~ tunes on here."
5,I don't know why people don't care for the interludes...,"The interludes give the song a backstory, and I love all of them. Every song is amazing, and you can't resist nodding your head to songs like Get On Up, and Bring On Da Funk. I don't want to get into this, because i would go on and on about this amazing album. All in all, Jodeci seriously needs to get back in the game, it's been almost 17 years too long!"
5,UNTITLED,Jodeci speaks for themselves- this definitely will get a party going- a late night party at that... Obviously for the Grown and Sexy :)
4,EVERY FREAKIN' NITE& DAY,I'M A DIEHARD JODECI FAN AND I JUST LOVE THEIR LAST AND FINAL ALBUM IF YOU GET PAST THE INTERLUDES YOU WILL FIND A SENSUAL BABYMAKING ALBUM!
2,Jodeci's worst,"Keeping it real... I remember when this album came out... I remember what I thought. One track... ""Love u 4 Life"". I should have bought that single, but I was down for the group so I copped the whole thing.Love U 4 Life, if I'm correct, was part of the original group of demos that Jodeci used to get their deal with UPtown, that included material from the Forever My Lady CD, which was their first. Perhaps if it weren't included on this album, I;d have htought differently of the project, but it's presence made all of the rest sound liek imitations of the great Jodeci."
3,Both Sides of the Argument,"Most Jodeci fans were a little disappointed from this album, considering how almost everyone I knew spent their money to buy '93's hit ""Diary of a Mad Band"" and they were expecting the exactly the same thing they had received then. While I admit that not all of the songs are classic/favorite-worthy, there are a lot of silk sheet stunners which are not given the credit they deserve. And not only that, but the beats in this one, regardless of how the songs may sound, are worth a listen within themselves. So although I would not recommend this title for someone who was being introduced to the rhythmic sounds of the band named Jodeci, I would definitely recommend this album for a sweaty summer night for two."
4,Heat Up Your Bedroom,"I surprised my wife by reading a few passages aloud one night. She seemed a bit aloof a first, but as I read more and more she could no longer hide her arousal and we were soon entwined for a rather long lovemaking session. We have used many of the techniques in this book to spice up our love life! She has even tried a few things she had shied away from before. Hearing what other women found enjoyable has opened her mind and body!If you have an open mind and are not offended by frank explicit discussions this book is for you and your lover!"
3,Dover Score of Mahler 5th and 6th Symphonies,"It is ok to buy this, if you don't have to conduct it. For listening and ""just"" studying it's ok, but it has so different orchestration in some places, errors and stuff like that that if you make a mistake going in front of an orchestra with it, you're in trouble.Better buy Universal Edition (or try to get some library score), if you are seriously interested.Of course the real edition price is probably 5 times bigger but in conductor's wages it doesn't matter, doesn't it :) ?Of the music: both symphonies are great masterpieces, the Adagietto from 5th is heavenly..."
4,Good score,"This is a great collection of the Mahler Symphonies, there are much better editions out there but for the price these are a good buy!"
5,"Awesome movie, awesome soundtrack","I love this soundtrack. :) Especially the song that has Rachel Griffiths speaking on it. I love her, I love her voice. :)"
2,Beware ...,"The MAXIMUM weight capacity, stamped on the boat, is 300 lbs, not 360 lbs. Plan on at least an hour to pump it up to a pressure well above 1 - 2 PSI. If 2 adults fit in this boat and it will still float, they must be exceedingly thin or small. Otherwise the baoat seems to be well made."
5,Don't indict the product over your lemon,"We bought this product within days of its release and have never had a single, solitary complaint. It works perfectly, records beautifully, and I can't imagine TV-viewing without it. We have never had any kind of challenge or concern. Every product will have a few lemons from manufacturing, but that in no way indicts the product or its features. Can't speak to customer service quality since we have never had to call..."
3,Lukewarm,"OK. I'm not overly happy with my purchase but have enjoyed the experience of Tivo. And the Directv in same box is perfect for us Tivo/Directv subscribers. However, over the last two and half years I've had the hard drive replaced twice. Sony paid for the first one (I paid for shipping). And I paid for everything the second go around. Now during the last year of owning this product I've had light static snow showing up. I did plenty of tests to ensure that it is in fact my SAT-T60 causing this static to appear. So, I'm lukewarm. I feel I paid plenty of money for it. But the longevity and quality just wasn't there. Had no modem problems luckily. Good luck!"
5,I still love my 10 year old Sony T-60,"Right now I'm waiting for a replacement hard drive. This is the second time in 10+ years. I ordered it from weaknees.com for about $100.00. I will keep this unit working as long as possible as it has a lifetime TIVO service contract associated with it.It is easy to use, and pretty much foolproof.I don't use the modem others have complained about because Ma Bell has worse customer service than Sony. The unit will not connect with my internet phone service, and I now have failed to make a call for over 1600 days. Big deal. They will never disconnect me. It is not their policy.I use this unit in a bedroom with a small 32"" TV. I know it's not HDTV, but it produces a great picture as is. I will keep this unit as long as possible."
4,Captures the Imagination,"Posthumous speculation on what Hendrix was going to release next. A great collection of mature late Hendrix as he moved into a new period. Heavy guitar solos like Midnight, Pali Gap and Peace in Mississippi really beef up the vocal tracks. This album has been heavily criticized for tampering with the Hendrix vision, but the song selection is better structured than the official release New Rays. It also does justice to the tracks they just threw onto South Saturn Delta without any thought of album cohesion."
4,worth the listen! Welcomed into my Hendrix collection as different view of last valuable drops of Hendrix's genius!,"Better then I expected, having read many mixed reviews. Worth the listen to further glimpse last drops of Hendrix's genius!"
2,Sacrilege to the Hendrix Fan,"Probably Alan Douglas's biggest slap in the face to Hendrix fans, Voodoo Soup was supposed to be the outtakes album that got it right. However, added effects by Douglas and more overdubs by people some 25 years after the fact didn't do Hendrix (or his fans) any kind of justice. He brought the former drummer of the Knack in to overdub the drums on Room Full of Mirrors and Stepping Stone just because he worked for Douglas and could play the drums. Unforgivable. Somehow I don't think Jimi would have liked that. Why not bring in Mitch Mitchell? He's still alive! And, of course, he was actually Jimi's drummer.Skip this one. Get First Rays instead."
1,only Idiots rate this higher than 1 star,"Alan Douglass went back in the studio, took finished and unfinished tracks and REMIXED them, and heavily remixed them, some sound worse and have a bootleg like quailty to them, one I feel did sound better ""Drifting"". This was his idea to replace the orignal 1971 release of ""The Cry Of Love"" both are now out of print and replaced by the superior ""First Rays of the new rising Sun"" brought back were the orignal mixes used by Eddie Kramer, Mitch Mitchell, and Jimi hemslef acyually produced 4 of the tracks."
4,A real space saver,"I have transfered all my photos onto Flip Albums, and like the CD maker because I can send family members an album and the program is included, so they have no trouble viewing it. The only problem with the CD Maker, is that the albums can only hold 200 photos, but it is still a tremendous space saver. Now all my photos can be stored on disc, and not in bulky albums. They view like a real album, and can even be flipped automatically or viewed as a slide show by the most novice of computer operators."
5,Buenisimo para crecer espiritualmente,"Scott, aqui en este libro los ayuda a los catolicos a apreciar lo que tenemos, nos acerca mas a nuestra Iglesia y nos inspira a aprender mas de nuestra fe, de nuestra pura tradicion. Una historia de convercion muy bonita a la Iglesia de Cristo, ""la Iglesia Catolica"". Recomiendo este libro a todo aquel que tenga hambre por la verdad ya sea catolico o protestante."
3,"Good coverage of core concepts, but otherwise out of date","I bought this book after seeing some of Dr. Lang's lectures at Columbia University on business analysis tools and database design, which were very well explained.However, it became clear this book was not up to date, where for example stakeholders are referred to as user interfaces, and further, this kind of obtuseness carries on in the explanations of most of the topics and does not reflect the maturity of the topic as it stands today. Should have checked the published date - 2001.All is not lost however... it does provide good coverage of the core concepts and tools used in business analysis and design such as JAD, data modeling, decomposition, ERDs, normalization and the use of object orientated design. Still, every other topic needs a lot of updating. In 2001, it would have rated close to 5 stars, but not any more."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is a terrible book. It is completely unfocused. It moves from topic to topic without any worthwhile detail about any specific topic. Concepts are not adequately explained -- either you already understand the topics in this book, in which case you don't need this book; or you don't already understand the topics in this book, in which case this book will not help you understand them. If you want to learn about database design, buy a good book on that subject (for example, Hernandez). If you want to learn about object-oriented design, buy a good book on that subject. If you want to learn about writing requirements, buy a good book on that subject. It is ridiculous for the first reviewer to suggest that this book teaches anything useful about writing requirements. Don't waste your money on this book - it's completely useless."
3,"A little too soupy, needs spice","In general this cd is a little too slow for me. Infact I would be hard pressed to find an upbeat song on this album. This is a good cd for ""mellowing out"" but I miss the fun lyrics of some of his past cd's like ""Last Mango in Paris"" (which happens to be my favorite). This is not a bad album, after all....it is Buffet...and how could you go wrong with Jimmy?"
1,One of his worst ever,"Sometime around the mid 1980s I noticed that Rolling Stone stopped writing reviews of Jimmy's releases. This made sense, since he never really did anything new or different (until the 2000's). This one is just more of the same banal/lackluster junk he put out during a 15 year drought."
5,Quintessential Jimmy,This album is fantastic! If you are looking for a first album by JB buy this one. You will Not be disappointed. I adore this album. There is not one song I skip over like I do some of his other albums. Buy it!
4,Paysoff the price,Valuable book according to price. However there is a small binding problem in my copy...Yagmur TOPRAKLI
5,A Wonderful Read of a Classic American Story,"Heartily recommended. Miradero reveals the inner strength of a Vanderbilt heiress whose mythically grand lifestyle was shattered by her husband's morphine addiction. Her ability to shed her Victorian upbringing to take control of her life makes for a timeless story.Author Robert Ganger's ""window"" on Lila Vanderbilt Webb's life is intriguing. He lives in Miradero, a historic home near Palm Beach that Mrs. Webb designed when she was elderly, deaf, and almost broke. A good read for Vanderbilt buffs, and anyone interested in Palm Beach in its heyday. Richly illustrated, too. The photos are worth the price of the book."
2,Very muted colors,"I already have a decent inkjet, but I wanted one with higher resolution and better photo-realism. I read reviews about the C80. The resolution on it is fantastic. But, after running 4 hours of trials on it (in a serious attempt to achieve decent color), I decided to return it. On my other printer (only 1440 dpi) the colors are crisp, rich, and sharp -- especially the blacks. Looking at conventionally developed photographs, the same can be said. On the C80, the colors are VERY muted -- DULL. I called Epson, and they confirmed that the archival inks have a different tone than their standard inks. The Espson driver doesn't even offer an independent control over the black saturation (even though it does provide one for cyan, magenta, and yellow). If you're looking for realistic photos, this is NOT the way to go if color is important."
1,Buyer Beware,"I have had Epson printers for over 10 years so I know a good Epson printer when I see one. This is not a good printer. The colours are dull despite being heavy on ink and the printer needs constant head cleaning to keep away heavy banding. While not being a professional standard at this price you would expect this to be a quality product. Mine failed after 15 months and, in my opinion, Tech Support are neither Technical or Supportive.I would strongly advise caution before paying your hard earned cash for this unit. As for me I moved to a Canon i9100 - Lets see if this fares any better."
1,Ink Dumping is Right!!!,"!!!This is exactly what happen to me!""I bought the printer in November 2001 for home use. I typically do not print more than 20 pages per week. The printer worked fine until about a month ago when I discovered a pool of ink at the bottom of printer. I assumed it was a faulty ink cartridge, cleaned it up and bought a new cartridge. I have ink at the bottom of the printer again. I contacted Epson. After a couple of emails, they suggested that I call their tech support line. That would cost $10 just to talk to them. The printer goes in the garbage and I am replacing it with an HP.""The dates may be different, but the model and problems are exactly the same, write down to the $10.00 service call. What a racket! The warranty was for a year and that is as long as the printer lasted. I will never buy an Epson again, but I won't buy an HP either."
1,"A real lemon, but not even good enough for lemonade","After owning an Epson Stylus Color and loving it, I thought I couldn't go wrong with the C80. WRONG! I am very disappointed with this printer. It has a very annoying habit of feeding paper, returning it to the feed tray, and then printing on nothing. I've used more ink on the bottom of the printer than I've actually put on the paper. Between printing on nothing and having to clean the print heads often, I'm lucky if I get 100 good printouts per ink cartridge. It also feeds too much ink in places and leaves big splotches on the printout. I used to swear by Epson but now I swear I'll never own another one."
2,"Disappointed, simply not reliable","I had an HP printer for years, never had a problem. I've had this C-80 for 6 months now and it is nothing but trouble. Color rarely prints properly, 1-8 sheets of paper feed each time, the printer goes through ink like crazy, but it doesn't seem to end up where it is supposed to be on the paper.Bottom line: a complete piece of junk."
3,Photo quality limited by faded colors,"Colors in photos are washed out. Cannot handle deep blues, deep reds or deep yellows. The ink is handy though, replaceable individually, but I wish they would revamp the ink quality for this model.Construction quality is superb, this printer will last you several good years. It prints very quickly. The price is great and the cost of ownership is low in part to the individually replaceable ink cartridges.I love everything about this printer except the photo quality. I expected better inkjet quality from Epson. I guess they are trying to steer me into needing an inkjet printer and an inkjet photo printer. I'd rather have a laser printer and an inkjet photo printer."
1,Worst printer I have ever bought - Period!,"First off, the printer requires re-calibration just about every time I go to use it and it takes about 30 seconds before its capable of printing. Next, ALL ink cartridges must be full in order for the printer to function and the re-calibration process uses ink. Do you see where I'm going with this? That's right, you have to replace the empty ink cartridges black or color used or not before you can even print a document - no exceptions. Lastly, and most noticeable is that you have to shell out [mooney] for a new black cartridge and [money] for each color (x3) to keep this printer working. Outrageous! I bought a new Canon i320 ..."
1,Worst Printer ever,"I bought one of these from my local camera shop. The store owner raved about them. To be sure mine did work fine, once I'd used 1/4 of the ink supply calibrating the thing.Then over the next six months it went in for repairs three times for clogged heads (using Epsons wonderful ink) (twice) and once with a broken paper feeder.The last time we insisted on a replacement. When it had arrived, it broke within 3 weeks. Another paper feeder, plus ink dumps everywhere.What an expemsive load...! It costs a fortune to run too, though we've never used one long enough to go through the ink.Thinking of buying this printer. Just don't do it."
1,Poor longevity,"I purchased my printer 13 months ago, and this month it started to read ""paper jam"", despite the lack of paper in the machine. I have been told that the paper feed is malfunctioning, this is after very light use over the last year. My best option is to replace the printer. Also, the replacement ink cartridges are expensive. I would not buy this printer again."
2,Epson C80,"Great printer when it works, unfortunately you use more ink cleaning the heads then you do printing. You have to clean the heads constantly before printing and if you have a long document you might have to stop and clean the heads half way through printing the document. The black ink is very expensive especially when you have use half of it to clean the heads. Should have bought an HP"
4,Great Printer...but hard on the ink,"A great little printer, but it goes through ink quickly. Prints fast and with great resolution."
1,Worst Printer Yet,"I am a P.C. Tech and even with my knowledge and experience, I could not troubleshoot this unit to work properly. I run Win XP Pro and even though the printer was recognized by windows, it did not print properly from the start. After many hours of updating drivers, reinstalling, and uninstalling, I figured I must have received a bad apple and exchanged it for another one.Same nightmare revisited. The main problems were that the photos I printed always had faint lines. Of course I did nozzle cleanings, new cartridges, head alignment, etc. Also, the printer would spool mystery documents that I would constantly be cancelling or it would print half a document and decide to start on a fresh piece of paper. Overall, I will never buy another Epson due to lack of customer support as well as inferior product."
3,The honeymoon is over!,"I was impressed at first; quiet, clear printouts, stable drivers, linux-compatible...Now...The print head clogs after just a few hours' downtime. Cleaning the heads wastes ink, and I have to do that a LOT.The printout is still streaky, even after head cleaning. The colors are off..Am now looking for a new printer."
1,Epson please let us know,"I totally agreed with all the reviews about the C80, I would like to ask if EPSON could help by printing on the Manual book: this printer does not last long. Buy at your own risk. It would help !!!"
1,Either its a piece of junk or I have some bad Luck!,"I purchased the C80 about 3 weeks ago because of all the Great reviews it recieved from everywhere. I opened it up and tried to turn it on and nothing! The Power Button was broken. It simply would not turn on. Well I figured it was damaged during shipping or something. Mistakes happen. So, I exchanged it for another and this time the Power button worked just fine so, after I had it all set up I clicked the Print Icon on my Cpu and wow the the Paper pulled through to the left and jammed. So I tried again after getting the paper out and it jammed in the same way again and again and again! Finally a spring popped out from the inside. Well Obviously I had enough and am now getting a refund. I don't know. Maybe I have bad luck or maybe Epson is starting to have some Quality Control issues. I wouldn't buy an Epson product again."
2,If you are a gluttin for punishment then this one is for you,"I purchased this printer because I needed an ink that would not smear. The ink is wonderful. But help you if you need customer support. They were very unhelpful with my problem of the printer printing lines through my pictures and documents. After 20 min on hold, (not an 800 number either) the support person was ungracious, and unhelpful. I would have been much better off just buying the replacement ink for my Lexmark Z42, a printer from which I had no problems. The Epson prints very slow through the parallel port, the settings for Higher and Lower resolution are hard to navigate, and it feeds itself 3 or 4 sheets at a time making printing truly a chore."
2,Epson C80,"This printer is very fast when it actually starts printing, but if you print a lot of one page items like I do, it takes forever to spool and I'm getting about 2 pages a minute in black, because of the long spool time. And, an annoying pop up screen comes up when it's printing that I have to minimize each time so I can continue in my application. Also, it will not print from DOS programs even though the manual says it will, I called tech support and they said that this printer is not set up to print from DOS applications. Overall, fast printer and quiet printing but very noisy paper feed."
1,Don't waste your money,"I write this as a graphic artist who has worked in the print industry for 5 years. I'm not just an at home freelancer. This never produced ""photo quality"" pictures. It was okay for printing text but it is not for a true graphic artist of photographer. My first serious problems started exactly one week after the one year warranty expired. Banding problems, ink pools on glossy paper, constantly have to realign and clean print heads. Not to mention having to replace the ink every three months. Now I have just replaced all the ink cartridges and it is just spitting out blank sheets of paper. Customer support is useless, they just brag that they have the best products. Judging from the comments I read on other sites, many people have had the exact same problems."
2,Too many problems,"I bought an Epson C80 along with my Dell Computer, and it constantly gives me hell. The main problem is the nozzles.. they get clogged way too easily and no matter how many times I clean them using the automatic nozzle cleaner function built in, the clog won't go away. I will have to buy a head cleaning kit to fix it.The other problem I have is that it doesn't print on the paper straight because it pulls the paper in at an angle. I have no idea how to fix it.I have only had the printer for a little over a year. My dad owns an older Epson and hasn't had any problems with it. So if you want an Epson.. choose an older printer rather than the C80."
1,Performed OK for a while,"I've had this printer for under a year, and after maybe 6 months or so, the black/white print quality is terrible. I get gaps/lines/blurrs in the text.I have always used HP inkjets, and I thought those were poor because after about 2 years, the paper feeder would break. But at least they always printed with high quality until then.I also felt like the printer said the cartridge was out of ink when it did not seem like it was, but I'm not sure about htis.Anyway, I would not buy a non-HP deskjet again, as I now have to trash this printer after wasting money on all new cartridges in the hope that they might solve the problem."
1,Aviod this printer,"The ink is over priced, the printer wastes ink, and you can't print in black only if any color cart is empty."
1,Black is the color....,"This is a nice printer, if you're looking for one which will dump black ink into the bed of the printer without warning. When I asked the tech staff about this, they suggested cleaning it up. Which I did, so the printer dumped again. I've been using the manufacturer's cartridges, so it's consistent at least. I really would have liked tech staff to answer my questions about what caused the dumping and what to do about it, but ""clean it up"" was the best I got. My next printer won't be an Epson."
2,If you like feeding problems you will love this printer.,"The C-80 prints great photo's. That's about it. Why can't they get it to feed properly?? I had one for a week and it jammed so bad with christmas cards that I took it back and got another, it doesn't feed any better than the first one. Post cards and envelopes are a disaster. The mechanisim that jostles the media in the paper tray actually threw some of my post cards out of the tray, some fed sideways, and other times it fed 4 or 5 cards at a time. Same with envelopes. My christmas card printing secession ended up with me feeding one sheet at a time, otherwise it would feed 3 or 4 sheets at a time regardless of how you set the paper thickness selector. I tried contacting Epson by FAX, (I wouldn't spend the money for a regular long distance) no reply, so I am going to return this one and trade for a HP or Lexmark."
1,C80 Has big problems,"As the reviews on this page demonstrate, Epson has some significant problems with their C80 printer. I've owned 4 Epson printers and this is the first one with which I had any problem. The printer produces dull, lifeless prints on Epson Quality Glossy Paper, far inferior to my old Epson 740. I spent more than two hours (at my expense) talking with their technical people who gave me widely differing opinions and advice. Eventually they told me to return it and buy a different Epson printer. I don't think Epson knows what's wrong with their product."
2,"Frequent Trouble, Smearing, Expensive Ink","I bought the C80 based on very favorable press reviews and regret it. When it wants to, it can print beautifully. But it often feeds more than one page, smears ink, and needs frequent nozzle cleaning/adjustment. It seems to eat ink, and the cartridges are more expensive than others (around 50 bucks for a set a couple of times each year). I'm switching back to HP."
1,don't buy Epson,Epson has now developed their printers so that the ink cartridges cannot be refilled or cannot use non Epson cartridges. This way they can keep raising prices on cartridges and there will be no choice but to pay their greedy prices.
4,Bruce Writes...,"I'm new to this printer, but after the usual set-up & related hassles of a baby-boomer setting-up a lst time computer...I'd say it operates fairly well. But, what do I know? I always like reading other reviews, because it alerts me to functions that I overlooked by not reading the manual...thanks to those other people's reviews. I should learn to read-n-write, but then I'd be overqualifed for employment in the United States. I like it just fine...thank you...by remaining eligible for employment! Let's have a round-of-applause for all of us minus IQ types!"
3,Good Value for your money,"This printer is a great value at the price you are paying for it i really believe you get a lot. Fast black printing speed, although i must say i have printed some photos on special paper and print time is SLOW. The paper tray doesnt hold much paper, although the ink lasts a long time your gonna have to buy 3 cartdriges when its time for new ones. This printer is loud not printing but when it is actually feeding the paper into the printer it makes a loud sound which i didnt like. Otherwise fast clean and crisp, easy to install."
4,A Good Choice,"Nice printer,Clear colours, crisp text, quiet fast operation. Good value for money, good ink cartridge life (the separate colours tanks are great) and overall, a really nice little printer that can handle high volumes well..."
3,decent but not great,"Pluses for this printer includes cheap price, individual color ink wells, and very good plain paper prints. Prints on matte paper is supposed to be very good, but I haven't tried it yet. Prints on glossy print, in my own opinion, is poor. I've compared it to the HP 970c... and the colors simply are not as brilliant, even with adjusted settings. That's a minus 2 stars in my book."
1,after four years it went kaputt,agreed with other reviewrs: beyond four years this thing is simply done with.
3,dissapointed,"I bought the Epson C-80 hoping for great photo quality prints. Unfortunately, I've gotten nothing but dull photos. I've tried every settings with several different types of paper and I can't seem to get an acceptable ""photo quality"" print. The colors are very dull and lack saturation (even after several Photoshop adjustments). The blacks are also not very black. I'm kind of stuck with it now but wish I had done a little more research. If you want a printer that prints black text quickly, this is it. If you want a printer that prints photo quality prints with good saturation and rich blacks, this is definately not it. I'll probably end up buying another printer and keep this for black text print outs. In terms of setup, I had no problems (Windows 98, Dell PC, Pentium 3)."
1,"Run, run fast...","Not only does this printer run through ink *way* too fast, it dies right around the time your warranty expires. My first one just stopped printing (well, it went through the motions, but produced a blank sheet of paper) just under a year after I bought it. Epson was familiar with the problem and walked me through all the possible fixes. They finally sent me a replacement, which died in just a few months -- but past the end of my warranty, of course. This was my first experience with Epson, and I'm not so sure I'll buy from them again."
2,Epson C80 Printer- More trouble than its worth !!,"I have 2 of these ink jet printers. When they are new they're fine. After use, the ink jet nozzles become clogged and cause nothing but printing problems. This is a common problem as witnessed by numerous customer complaints about it, and the large number and variety of nozzle cleaning kits sold. I followed the Epson Web Site to correct the problems to no avail. The final result from Epson was: ""Take it to the repair shop."" Local charge to unclog the printing nozzels is $ 130 because of the time it takes to clean. Instead, I bought two Brother HL-1440 Laser Printers. Installation was simple using the CD provided. The printing looks great, AND I NO LONGER MUST BE CONCERNED WITH STOPPED UP NOZZLES AND CONSTANT REPLACEMENT OF EXPENSIVE TONER CARTRIDGES !! The Brother HL-1440 prints up to 3,000 copies on a laser cartridge that takes 30 seconds to replace."
1,Epson makes worst printer known to man...,My printer goes through ink like a man in the Sahara goes through water. It also has a nasty habit of dumping ink all over the inside of the printer. Will NEVER buy Epson again.
2,Do not buy this can opener.,"Within the first week of operation,this can opener acted up.It wouldn't start running,and then it wouldn't stop running unless you unplugged it.It was very disappointing and frustrating.Besides,with the cost of shipping,you're paying almost as much for it as you would be for a better one.Don't settle."
1,Piece of Junk Disguised as a Can Opener,"Silly me--I thought can openers were supposed to open cans easily, or at least open them-not this one! I had to replace my 30 year old electric can opener; unfortunately, I choose this one. It rarely opens cans--it's almost impossible to get a can lined up correctly, when I do, it slops liquid all over the counter, gets shreds of labels in the food. I thought Black & Decker made good products--not any more. This 100% piece of aggravation is joining the ""Mallet Pile""--purchasing mistakes that friends, neighbors, and I smash with a large, heavy mallet (it works!)-and BAM BAM BAM--took care of that problem!"
2,useless,I've already thrown it away. It didn't cut all the way around the can. It tore off pieces of the paper label.
1,"Worst ever, but at a bargain price","Our old broken Sunbeam works better than this new B&D. Shreds top edge of label as it cuts the lid and pieces of paper invariably end up inside the can. The tracking wheel grips well, but leaves sharp edges around the rim, making it dangerous to flatten the can for recycling. It is louder than the 10 year old sunbeam, too. We're taking it back. Thankfully Kohl's has a great return policy."
1,Awful,I own this can opener. My wife simply can't get it to open cans. I can get it to work if I bend way down and keep working the action while watching to try and eventually succeed in catching the rim of the can. It then typically shreds some of the paper near the lid and at that point works just fine in cutting the lid off. We are pulling an old manual can opener out of the junk drawer to open cans until we buy a replacement. Whoever designed this out to be fired.
1,Poorest can opener ever,"This is absolutely the poorest quality can opener I've ever used. The previous model that we had was also Black & Decker and our experience with it was very good, so we invested in this model. It turned out to be a major error. It is very difficult to line the can up, to open. At least half the time I end up using a manual opener because trying to open a can is so difficult. Often you can start to open and it will start and then pop out of position so it no longer opens the can. I wish I had read the reviews above before purchasing, as it seems others have experienced that same difficulty we have. What a waste of money, If they had paid us to take it home, it would still be too expensive."
1,Poor Quality Can Opener,"The first time I used this can opener, it would not open the can. I had to move the can to a couple different spots on the lid for it to finally grab hold and open it. Then, it dropped the can after it finally opened. I used it for about four months before deciding it was of a very poor quality, in my estimation. Before buying it, I did not consult with the Amazon reviews. Since then, I looked at the can opener reviews and purchased a West Bend can opener which is perfect! No comparison between the two different brands."
1,Cutter is NOT dishwasher safe!,In two different spots this is stated in the description to have a dishwasher safe cutter. The manual clearly states NOTHING is dishwasher safe on this can opener. MANUAL HAND WASHING REQUIRED. I am returning it to Amazon.
3,Attractive But Annoying,"This can opener is attractive and very functional except for one very annoying problem. The lever that punctures the lid and holds it in removes very easily for cleaning. However, it removes a little too easily. In fact, it's almost impossible to remove the opened can from the opener without removing the lever assembly also. That means that the lever (and magnetically attached lid) falls into the can or worse on your countertop. It's also a bit of a trick to get the can lined up just right to puncture the lid and open the can."
1,Worst can opener I've ever owned.,"This with a doubt one of the worst can openers I've everowned!! I bought it because it is attractive and willaccept tall cans. It is attractive, but not veryfunctional. It is so very difficult to get the canpositioned just right, so it will open, that it takes5 or 6 tries just to get it to work. The ""lid catcher""blocks your view of the mechanism so it's almostimpossible to position the can properly. In additionwhen removing the can, the cutting arm mechanism slidesoff the opener most of the time.Don't but this poorly designed product!!!"
4,Tall can opener review,"I recently purchased the Black & Decker Grand Openings II Extra Tall Can Opener in black to coordinate better with a new countertop that I just had installed. It is very similar to a Black & Decker white tall can opener that I had been using, which I loved. The black can opener runs well and smoothly. My only complaint is when opening a can that has a lot of liquid in it, the liquid splashes out when the can opener stops. This happened to me when I was opening some cans of minced clams and I had clam juice all over my counter. This didn't happen with my old can opener. Otherwise, I like the new can opener."
1,B%D GRAND OPENINGS CAN OPENER,"Worked fine for about six months, then failed to open anything. Always struggled with coffee cans. I don't know, is six months a decent run?"
1,Do not buy this can opener,"I wish I had read these reviews before a bought this can opener.This is the worst can opener I have ever used. I bought it because it was made by Black and Decker. I did not look at the reviews before I bought it because I figured how can you screw up a can opener. Boy was I wrong.The blade is very short so it does not always catch the can so you have to make sure you get it just right.The magnet does not stay attached to the unit. It always comes off.Forget opening tall or big cans, it just does not do a good job. I use my had can opener for that.I was very surprised that Black and Decker puts out such a bad item. They used to make really good stuff.Save your money and do your research , there has to be a better can opener out there."
1,Black & Decker can opener,"This is the worst can opener I have ever bought, I have had it for one week, everytime I try to use it I have to fight getting the can set in the cutting area. The holder with the cutter keeps falling off. When I finally get the can opened, the magnat that suppose to hold the lid, falls off with the lid into the can I had just opened.Come on Black and Decker! Bring the quality goods back into the USA, MADE IN THE USA, NOT CHINA!!!I threw this can opener away. Looking for USA can opener, or will use my manual crank can opener."
3,extra tall can opener,I found the product to work very efficiently. I am pleased with the knife sharpener and the size for the extra large sized cans.
2,Piece of junk,"I gave it a fair shot, but this piece of junk just doesn't make it. It takes 2 or 3 tries to get it to grip the can. Then half way through it lets go. Also the top portion, that separates for cleaning, does so way too easily. I'm giving up and replacing it."
1,I wouldn't buy this model again.,It is difficult to get the can inserted properly for the pointed end to puncture it. I have to push up from the bottom of the can 9 times out of 10 in order for it to catch on. Too bad as Black and Decker has always been a good brand.
4,Works very well,I bought this for my Grandmother as a change from the traditional can opener. Being able to use this without assistance is helping her keep her sense of independence as she gets older.
1,Don't bother,"I bought this item at a local retailer. After reading the reviews here on Amazon, I decided to try and open a can. It was difficult, and I gave up after a few attempts. I returned the item and got a different brand."
1,The worst can opener I have ever owned,"In addition to the reasons to avoid this product mentioned in other reviews, including the difficulty in getting the opened can extracted from the opener, bits of paper shredded off by the can opener, etc., I would like to add: The design of this model causes the can being opened to be tilted up at enough of an angle to cause whatever liquid is in the can to pour out onto the opener and countertop, etc. This is especially unpleasant when opening tuna and is almost impossible to avoid unless another person holds the opener tilted forward on its front edge while the can is being opened. It is also very difficult to get the can started opening. If only replacement blades were available for my sturdy, reliable Rival can opener! Unfortunately, I did not realize how bad this Black and Decker was until it was too late to get my money back."
1,junk,"this is the worst hunk of junk i ever purchased,tried to use it 3 times,ended up smashing it with a hammer,threw it in the trash where it belongs,never again black&decker"
3,Not a stereo mic,This is not a stereo microphone like Sony and Amazon web sites claim it to be. I have noticed it right away after the box has arrived. You can see for yourself that the plug is mono. I don't know why Sony claims it to be a stereo microphone on their web site.
2,Disappointed...not a stereo microphone,Sony's misleading advertisement states that this is a stereo microphone. It's not.
2,Very confusing,"I did not really care for this book. Alot of words, not many pictures, and very confusing on trying to look something up. Not a help to me at all."
5,Great for the money,I have several of these installed in customer machines.Not much to say -- they have worked flawlessly from word go. Documentation is a little sketchy and once you are through it and up and running I have not had *any* issues with these cards.
5,My girlfriend's favorite Valentine gift,I've been ordering them each year for her and she really loves them (all we ever see locally are the milk chocolate-covered variety).
3,Broken pieces,"Delivered on-time. However, although the first layer was fine, the bottom layer had many broken pieces."
3,Classic,"Another classic upbeat, transcending CD from Jodeci. This is hot stuff. Very different from the crap you hear on the radio today. Love this album, wish it was the clean version though as there's really no reason for them to talk the way they do. You can't argue with the beats, rythm and singing!"
3,Wilt,"This was a wacky, charming Brit farce about a man who dreamed of murdering his wife. Hilarity ensued, of course."
4,Sexually Obsesive Humour,"Wilt has a 1970's obsession with sex, having said that you can't get a funnier scene than Wilt a not very inspired teacher, coming home after a hard days work and being punched out by one of his students and all he wants is cup of tea and at the top of the stairs is his ample wife in bright yellow pajamas calling out something like: 'Penis baby I want to suck your nipples.' After that scene the sexual humour was perhaps a wee bit overdone, I like to laugh at peoples fumblings at sex such as in Thorogood's Hotel Le Big Knob but I think Wilt goes on a bit and lacks a likeable central character. However if you want to laugh at the sexual antics of 1970's academics you can't go past Wilt so grab it and read on Tom Sharp is definately funny."
2,There are Better,"I love Exo Terra products, but this one just did not hit the mark for me. It has to adhesive to the tank and does not lay completely flat due to the plug. It also does not put off enough heat with a 1/2' thick sand substrate."
4,Good heat source but ...,I really like this heat soucre. It does a great job at heating the bottom of the tank. The only issue I have with it is that it is semi-permanent. In other words you can not take it off and put it on another tank. If you try you could risk damaging it and the adhesive will not be as strong either. But this is still a great product to get!
5,Wow!! This Picture book works....,"Wow!! This picture book works on so many different levels. I just read it to my 23 sixth graders. Very powerful stuff. As an introduction to the Holocaust, I'd rank this book # 1...it will evoke a boatload of questions amongst your readers (and listeners!). Excellent writing craft to study!! The unfolding of the story will make readers predict and predict. ""I wonder..."" questions will surface at the end of this book...""What really happened to Rose Blanche?"" framed a long, rich discussion in our class!...Buy it, read it, buy one for a friend!!Frank Murphy"
5,Rose Blanche,This is a good introduction for a unit on WWII or the Holocaust for 5th grade and above. I was at a workshop on teaching reading comprehension and the instructor read it aloud to the adults. We were brought to tears by this story and it illustrated how important it is to use good read-aloud picture books even with older students to provide background knowledge about a topic. I finally ordered it to read with my own students.
3,Neelix and Tuvok together!,"Neelix and Tuvok are together in a shuttlecraft, not the ideal place to get to know each other, when their ship crashes onto a planet. Meanwhile Voyager is helping a local race to destroy asteroids that are heading toward their homeworld and coming dangerously close to destroying their civilisation. A much bigger and devasting plot is revealed throughout the episode as these random asteroids look to be targetting certain areas of the alien homeworld, somebody is behind it all.Less action then you'd expect from this type of story, focusing more on the crime-thriller side of things."
2,pathetic packaging,"Due to the positive reviews I was surprised when I received this mold. First of all make sure you want the brittle white plastic kind of mold and not the bendable clear plastic variety. This is the brittle white plastic, which they did not bother to protect in the least for shipping. I received this in an envelope without bubblewrap, cardboard or anything for protection and the envelope was one of those flimsy plastic (sorry I don't know what they are made of) ones, not a cardboard or even paper one. Consequently it arrived broken but isn't worth returning. The mold may be great but I don't have any respect for the company."
3,it works but won't last,"The candy comes out easily but once the sheet is bent it will not bend back, it's not very sturdy."
3,5 Star Game on a 3 Star Retro Kick in the Butt!,"Okay ... First off this is a cute simple game that a lot of people will enjoy the heck out of. You climb mountains as an eskimo and you can knock off your enemies from below or hit them with a hammer - classic NES ... simple and addictive. But what I want to know is this any different than the E-READER version which costs about $3? Anyone else notice that EXCITEBIKE, ICE CLIMBER, and DONKEY KONG (and DONKEY KONG JR) were all released as e-reader games at less than $6?!?!? Hmmmmm. Sounds kinda fishy to me that now they are on a cartridge ... alone for $19. Couldn't we have gotten a compilation cart? Just wondering!"
3,Review of Merriam-Websters French English Dictionary,"This dictionary is handy for it's size, but for the student of French Language , there are many words not included. So it is also not as handy as it could be for translating books etc from French to English. The semi- Thesaurus style included with the translation of each word is very helpful, though"
3,a bit schmaltzy,"Akkerman is the reason I bought it and his playing is excellent, but the match of Claus Ogerman's string arrangements with Akkerman's playing style makes for an awkward marriage at times. The arrangements remind me of Mancini, bordering on the edge of schmaltz. Sometimes the guitar work is too frenetic for the rather pastoral strings. The title cut is a nice jazzy arrangement of probably the best known composition by Joaquin Rodrigo. The balance between guitar and strings is at its best here. If you are looking for Akkerman solo guitar, I would recommend Passion, which is just guitar and fully showcases Akkerman's abilities."
3,Buy this if you are a fan of Claus Ogerman,This is a lovely example of the fluid lines and harmonies of Claus Ogerman. The guitar playing by Jan Akkerman is ok. But I bought this for Claus's arranging. He is the master!
3,A truly unique concept,"Aranjuez is in the trademark Jan Akkerman vein. Here is a concept rarely used---classical guitar fronting orchestra which shows that Jan is not interested in sales but in making great music. Someone more interested in classical music might easily rank this production 4 or 5 stars. Me, I'm a rocker, and that is what Jan basically is."
2,Why oh why abbreviate the original set?,"This is very frustrating for fans or collectors of Piaf's recordings.Apparently this record company released the full 3CD version a few years ago but this single set only includes an abbreviated version of the 3 shows available. WHY?And where is that elusive 3CD set gone? Anyone? I've searched high and low for it but can't find it anywhere. Did it really exist? Someone please show me it. It was titled ""Unplugged Quebec 1955-56"" apparently.In the meantime you'll have to make do with this compilation which features material that Piaf actually gave permission to be recorded in the first place unlike the Carnegie Hall shows from the same period.Frustrating to the extreme!"
3,Pac Man Fever Redux!,"Pac-Man is a great classic game! I love gobbling dots and ghosts, and could do it all day. It's a simple maze game that jump started the arcade craze. It caught on with girls and boys because it was a non-violent (sort of) cute and challenging game. You can never have enough pac-man in your life!But with the recent realease of THE PAC MAN collection for the GBA where you get 4 or 5 games, and the NAMCO MUSEUM which includes MS PAC-MAN .... why do we need a bare bones release? For about $5 more than carts with more games! Whacka Whacka ... HUH!?!?!? For $19.99 you could get the NAMCO plug in play which includes Dig Dug, Rally X, Galaxian, and another space game. RETRO is awesome, but I know you can fit more on a cart than just one PAC-MAN game. So yeah for PAC-MAN, and !?!??! for Nintendo."
3,Um..What? Excuse me?,"This is ""Classic NES Series"". I'm sure Pacman was released on the NES,but why the heck is it in this series?Still,it's a great game,if you like Pacman."
2,Only for the hardcore Pac Man fans.,This may be a good addition to someone absolutely obsessed with Pac Man but for me it was a total waste of money.25 bucks to pay for it and what do you get?A standard NES version of Pac Man and thats all.What a rip off! If youre just getting into Pac Man do yourself a favor and get Pac Man World 2 if you have a Cube and Pac Man Collection if you have a GBA.Both have the original arcade version of Pac Man plus other games.I think Pac Man World 2 is a much better deal than this piece of rubbish.The main game in PMW2 rocks plus you can unlock arcade games and tons of traditional Pac Man mazes.
1,Too big to fit,"The hat is too tall to fit in your head, so it sits in your ears... don't recommend this, I contacted seller, the said that those where the only sizes they got... They help out quite well, but the product itself is not good..."
4,HAVE PATIENCE,"This Program is excellent for the audio studio professional, but not very practical for the first time studio user. I't contains virtual dynamic studio instuments that seem state of the art. An excellent tool for the aspireing beat-maker or taylored musician, but if your a first timer like myself, you have to have lots of patience..Good luck!"
5,Better than advertised!!,"I've been hearing more and more about using shaving oils, but I was skeptical, thinking it was just another hype being force-fed to the buying public. But, on a whim I decided to get a bottle, folllowed the directions.....and I don't think I'll ever use another shave gel or cream ever again! My face has never felt smoother, it is very easy to trim around beards/moustaches, no lather to clean up after, and my face feels smooth all day long. I have a course beard, it's odd not feeling any ""5 o'clock shadow"" at the end of the day. I'll not be using anything else to shave with ever again."
3,good for travel but has disadvantages over gel/foam,"Shaving gets really boring, so it's nice to usesomething different once in a while. I've usedthis product for many years. If smells good, isgreat for travel, and provides for a good shave.However, after using it for a while I tend to goback to gel. This oil doesn't soften the beardas much as a gel or foam, making shaving lesscomfortable. Also, it doesn't rinse off theblade as well as gel or foam. Summary: great fortravel and for a break in the old routine.I've tried other varieties of King of Shavesshaving oils and feel the same about all of them."
3,Quick shave okay,"Not as smooth as lather but I like seeing exactly where the razor is cutting.Must rinse, actually tap the hair off the blades.I use only for a one day growth, if beard is heavy or a two day growth the razor dras and is painful.I will keep in my travel bag but going back to traditional lather for daily use."
3,Works as Advertised- read review,"I gave it 3 stars because I found it hard to wash off my hands after I put it on my face, the Pacific Shaving Company brand, (another vendor) just rinses off with warm water. The reason I find this an issue is, after I put the oil on my face, your hands are now oily and I have to stop to wash them with soap before i shave. Maybe just me."
4,It works.,"I've used it with double-edge safety razors and Mach 3. A few drops of this oil worked into clean, damp skin gives a smooth shave, without drying skin like soap lathers. Rinse and pat dry--some oil remains and protects skin. Minus one for being menthol-y, though only lightly."
2,Dated material,"Kinda curious due to the reviews. Not much there, however.This book was written in 2005 or so - and the world in 2011 is a lot different now. The author was employed in sales for eight years back in the 80's - then apparently rode the dot-com boom as sales trainer (lots of sales trainers then), hit the wall with everyone else with the dot-bust and then developed this stuff in mid-2000s. A lot of people who used to sell are now sales trainers.I saw bits and pieces of Miller-Heiman (or Miller-Sanchez or whatever) Solution Selling, SPIN Selling - the author did work at Xerox, which used SPIN and where the creator of Solution Selling worked.The book is basics which are useful if one has no exposure to any sales training or likes simple stuff, and in that regard is an easy read. Maybe that's why it has so many glowing reviews."
4,Must read for large case sellers,"Selling has changed due to technology and time demands on the buyers and business owners. The author goes through many reasons and settings that I have known, and validates and confirms the things I believe. The best part is the specific examples of actions and strategies to take, verbage for emails, voice mails. A very quick read that will change the way a large-case strategic, relationship salesperson approaches their target market."
5,Excellent Book!,I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to sell into large companies. It was very informative and gave great ideas!
2,Covers everything except for one important item,"This book covers how to narrow your companies; what to say to managers during your talk with them; it covers how to think differently than old sales techniques vs new sales techniques. The one thing is missing is after one narrows the companies, how do I contact them and who do I contact?"
4,New Hope for the Little Guy,"I just finished reading this book. It really is terrific.The best thing about it is that it gives people who have never thoughtabout attempting a sale to a big company the realization that yes, selling toa big company is doable and why shouldn't a big company's next vendor be me?This book also gives practical and easy-to-use-right-now tips on how tocontact the people who control the purse strings and make the decisions at large corporations.This book does a great job of helping smaller vendors break into the ""bigtime"".Richard Kennedy"
5,LOVE IT!!!,I love the book it is full of information that is needed in our ever changing economy. I've been in sales for a long time and I have not finished the book and using the practices I see results. I look forward to the next book.
5,Great Read!,My first book to read from Jill. It has wonderful ideas based on real world applications. Its def worth the price!
5,Tremendous Book! Very Relevant!,"I have been in the sales profession for over 30 years and have been on stage doing motivational speaking for the last 19 years. Get this book!Recently, I accepted a position as Director of National Accounts for a small company. I was really struggling to get into the General Mills' of the world, until I began to read this book! Jill takes the fear away by sharing techniques that anyone can do that are based upon common sense, but very, very insightful. Her knowledge comes from actually doing it herself!Jill knows exactly what's going on, is empathetic, downplays herself, and is transparent with her struggles and has incredible wisdom! That is so rare in a book of this genre. She also included templates for creating e-mails and voice messages that are fantastic! I find that hugely helpful!Thanks for writing this book, I hope it is a best seller! If it isn't, it should be!"
5,Excellent Info!,"Selling to Big Companies is a must have book! Jill covers everything from defining the real value of what you offer, to how to handle dreaded voicemail, to speaking with decision makers. Her information is easy to read and laid out like sales map pointing to the pot of gold. I highly recommend this book!"
3,USA oriented,"Quite a good book. It's especially valuable for salespeople who struggle to get through voicemail. Most of the value added comes form strategies that bring you through voicemail. I come form Europe where voicemail is not so popular and therefore the value of the book is limited for me. The book writes also about value, gatekeepers and other buying influences etc. but many of the subjects I have already read in other books."
5,The new sales...where ethics meet success!,"I bought this book at the same time as I bought ""Bag the Elephant"" by Steve Kaplan. (Do not waste your money on that one!) ""Elephant"" is full of the old tired sales techniques that we have grown to detest, while ""Selling to Big Companies"" offers a refreshing approach to selling by not selling. Jill Konrath puts you in the mindset of being a peer and a consultant, not a salesperson. In my personal experience, this approach honors your own committment to your line of work and takes you out of the realm of ""sales,"" and into the line of ""service."""
3,Not for non-technical people,"I bought this book hoping to learn some new ways to build small touring sets. Unfortunately only the first couple of chapters were really applicable to my situation. Even then, the directions for building were sketchy for non-technical types of people. I guess that the diagrams will make sense to someone who is used to building sets, but I am not and the language used is too technical for me. I did get some nice ideas about using screens and blinds, though."
3,"Read great customer reviews, but didn't work for my cat.","I purchased this in hopes to chill out my always jumpy 14 1/2 year old cat. Both generally & enough to make her let me periodically trim her nails with out her totally freaking out. But although I tried giving it to her several ways, the results were not what I (or she for that matter) would call successful. Mixing it in food, treats or water didn't work because it really smells bad & I'd assume tastes, horrible. I even tried a sneaky approach to hold her and shoot a dropper full down her throat, and make her swallow it. That was not good either! Eww. It made her saliva go all foamy & she threw it up everywhere. She DID get all stoned-like after it though, but I felt too bad to go near her after I did all that to her.So, not for us I think. But that's just my kitty...she may just be a special case. I'd suggest to the maker that they attempt to flavor it better for animals & include dosing suggestions more than just amounts. Good luck!"
2,Could be better,"As someone who is studying herbalism, I should have known better than to purchase this product for one of my cats but for whatever reason, I purchased it anyway. Basically, I have a cat with lots of anxiety and (now that I've tried this product) a confirmed case of kitty ADD. The valerian made my poor guy flip out (like catnip on steroids), so this stuff is going to sit on the shelf, after one use! I'm bummed that I spent the money on this product and have it not benefit my cat. If this product did not have valerian, I'm convinced it would do wonders for my anxious ADD cat."
2,Don't like this product very much!,When I give this to my cat he foams at the mouth and vomits. I would not recommend this for anyone....
3,"Great story ,a true inspiration to the music world",Everybody should have had a girl named peaches in there life.
4,Riding With The King,"After picking cotton in the Mississippi Delta, young Riley B. King makes his way to historic Beale Street in Memphis, and launches a career that later labels him as ""King of the Blues."" B.B. tells his story in this fine autobiography, which examines his childhood, the purchase of his 1st guitar at age 12, the musical influemce of his cousin Bukka White, the death of his beloved mother and his own difficulties with gambling & women (B.B. is candid about his 15-children by 15-different women). B.B.'s determination at overcoming obstacles, and his admirable work ethic (over 300 gigs a year for several decades), makes the reader want to pull up a chair in the back of a smokey blues club and appreciate all this man has accomplished."
5,"EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT","JUST WOULD LIKE TO SAY, B.B., IS THE KING OF THE BLUES, THIS BOOK ABOUT HIS LIFE GROWING UP. AND WHAT MUSIC HAS MENT FOR HIM. AND WHAT HE IS TO THE BLUES. THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ. IF YOU ARE A TRUE B.B.KING FAN. I HAVE A COPY AND HAVE READ IT OVER A FEW TIMES. IT IS SUPER."
4,Good story about the early years,I finished this book feeling somewhat in awe of a very sincere and hard working man. As far as an autobiography is concerned it is extremely light on detail after about 1970. However the stories of his early years growing up on cotton plantations and his first twenty years in the music business are rivetting. His musical interests are more catholic than you might expect and he is almost the only musician I've ever read about who didn't mess up with drugs. As often with these kind of books the musical detail is fascinating and he got me listening to Count Basie and Bukka White to name but two.There are also some heartbreaking and interesting stories about racism. Mr King has a firm commitment to a turn the other cheek approach and is a good spokesman for it.
5,"Straight yoga, all yoga....","This is a great video to practice with as it is definitely a ""Challenge"" for most yoga practictioners. The setting is simple as are the directions. The video is set with a soothing soundtrack to enjoy during your practice.There are three versions of the postures demonstrated so that there is something for all. Mr. Sanchez poses are the most interesting and will definitely prove challenging for most people. The other people in the video provide modified postures so that all can benefit from this wonderful video."
2,Not for beginners,"I am a fairly adept beginner but this workout was too much for me. I would recommend some interest in or experience with Bikram yoga before purchasing this tape. Although a there are easier modifications of asanas, a beginner may not have acquired sufficient strength and balance to keep from getting somewhat frustrated with this routine.Those who are more experienced or are interested in the Bikram style will probably be much more pleased with this video."
3,Yoga Challenge I : Hatha Yoga with Tony Sanchez,"This was the first Yoga tape I have ever purchased. It says it's a beginning level tape--I found that I could not comfortably do close to 80% of it. There were alternative positions for beginners to use, however, they were difficult too. If you are a beginner, you will need to watch the tape a few times before some of the positions are comfortable. You will work muscles you didn't even know you had! I had to give this 3 starts as I do not have anything else to compare it too. I didn't hate it right off the bat, however, it'll take some time before I love it."
5,really like,"I like to exercise (run,free weights) but am not a big ""yoga"" person like some are. I like to do yoga for flexibility & balance/core strength. I have been going to a general yoga class at the y for about a year, but prefer having the option to do this at home. This Tony Sanchez DVD (after trying a bunch of different yoga DVD's) ALONG with Paul Grilley's Ying Yoga DVD have hit the spot for me. Alternating between these two I get a good stretch and a strengthening and balance workout."
4,Bikram Yoga,This is perfect for those of you who don't want the hot yoga but love the postures of Bikram Yoga.
3,Pinches the Hell out of me,If you can handle how much this thing pinches you then it's a good belt. Sturdy and the chain is strong and long enough to go around 3 45's. It pinches the HELL out of you though. When you get enough weight on there it starts to pull on your skin and hurts like a mother. It could be just the way I'm built but it gets really freaking annoying after awhile. It's a good belt but dam it could have used some padding or something
3,Too small,"It is too small, nice little lights but too expensive for such a small ornament. I thought it was bigger and nicer."
5,Just Beautiful,This is a beautifully done ornament. It will be cherished for years to come. I would recommend this ornament for anyone who likes lights and music for deco.
4,Practice maketh man perfect..,"To start with, Flash4 Magic is not for BEGINNERS. It is for people who know, atleast, the basics of Flash4. So, do not expect much from this book regarding the ABCs of Flash4. Buy it if and only if you know some bits and pieces of Flash4. This book includes some real good exmaples, which make you familiar with all the aspects of Flash4. You come to know Flash4 much better. This book is unlike any other tutorial book who include a 1000 page manual with some silly jokes and load of text. Flash4 Magic doesn't do so. It has a helpful CD-ROM and a real useful interface. While you are practicing the examples given in the book, you find yourself becoming experts of Flash4. So, beginners can still have a second thought. But, anyhow, I feel this book is a helpful guide for intermidiates and also for experts. So, lets have our hands dirty. I would recommend you to get a copy now. Get rid of all those theories; get practical, because practice maketh man perfect!"
1,Flash Magic doesn't teach the reader anything! 1,Upon reading the reviews I was very excited to get it. As soon as I opened the book and saw the examples I knew it was useless. The book is basically a copy and paste tutorial not explaining how and why the examples work. Some examples are nice but not practical to a good web site. For someone that wants to learn action scripting I recommend you get it online. This book is horrible.
2,Very little real teaching going on here.,"I bought this book expecting to be walked through projects of ever increasing complexity, with detailed explinations along the way of how to do them. Instead, all this book is is a big collection of projects with no apparent order of difficulty, with little to no real help in explaining HOW they work, simply step by step instruction on how to build them. Since you can get tutorial projects off the internet for free, this book has turned out to be a waste of money for me. Be warned also that this book is definately not for beginners. Fortunatly I had some background with Flash, but not enough to make sense of many of the programing sections of the book. The only thing this book is good for is if you have a very specific task you need to acomplish with Flash that this book happens to detail."
1,I must be missing something!,"While the book may contain many useful actionscripts and trick, the step-by-step tutorials - the main focus of the book, are pretty bad. There are many errors, both in the body copy and in the instructions: Laughinator, page 39, step 8: ""...name the instance Slider"" generates the error message ""name already exists"". So what do I name it to continue the lesson?Or step 11, page 45: ""Select the insert a blank keyframe..."" What has been edited out? Or left in?The actionscript listing don't explain well enough what each line is doing, only what the script as a whole is doing. This does not help when you want to extend or use the script in some new way.I would not recommend this book until the obvious errors are corrected."
2,No me gusto... esperaba mas,"esperaba mas de este libro. Si bien trae buenos ejemplos esta demasiado enfocado en ellos, lo cual para mi por lo menos hizo practicamente inaplicables la mayoria de los Scripts que tenia cada ejemplo pues no explicaba el porque la utlizacion de cada uno; eso me llevo a perder demasiado tiempo tratando de entender cada uno.En definitiva malo si no sabes manipular bien Flash Script"
3,don't buy it if you are beginner of falsh users,"huh.... it's neat, great developed of the book.. but actually it's the book that abosolutely non-suitable for beginners (too much actionscript without detail explains)... it's the book that pretty suit for ppl who already new the basic program language."
3,I was looking for more...,"Today I opened this book, looking for clues to understanding actions scripting better. What I found were a number of cute-looking projects, such as an animated ""Lava Lamp"" that left me thinking ""now, when would I do that at my job?"". While I think it's great to offer a lot of fun projects to inspire and instill cofidence in designers, the question is: do such projects help a designer develop marketable skills? I've done some work in Flash sofar, and enjoyed playing around with the tweening/animation functions, but what I really want to see is a good book detailing action scripts, complex navigation menus, online sales functions, and accessing server-side databases. Learning these skills will help me sell my work to prospective clients. While animating is fun, I can put myself in the client's shoes, and ask: ""How can your Flash skills benefit my online business?"" That's where the rubber hits the road, and I wished this book had a tad more horsepower."
5,This is NOT for Beginners,"I have found this book to be the best one I own for Flash, however I already know HOW to use the program. The book is innovative and well written and the examples WITH the source code are remarkable. If you are trying to find a book to teach you to use the program, this is not it. Try the Flash 4.0 Quick Start Guide or have someone teach you the program. When you are ready to take your Flash skills to the NEXT level then, you are READY for this book."
2,Mac Users Beware,"Mac users need to stay away from this book. The very first example in the book you have to go to the web site to download a patch and it is totally differnet from the example in the book. I tried several of the other examples, none of which work. I've tried the same examples and the same steps on a PC at work and it works fine. If there was a PC only requirement stamped anywhere on the book, I wouldn't be so upset. PC users definately get this book. If you're a mac designer. Save your money. Come on Guys, haven't you ever heard of testing."
4,A good book on ActionScripting,"If you are looking for your first book in Flash, steer clear of this book (get Flash Web Design by Hillman Curtis). This book will leave you confused and frustrated. Which is unfortunately how most Flash designers end up (I was frustrated when I first tried to learn Flash 3).If you are comfortable with all of the basic functions of Flash and now want to get into more challenging project using ActionScripts, try this book. While I am not interested in producing the games they use in the tutorials, I have been able to pull pieces out of the lessons and use them in business applications I create (like dynamic organization charts).This is a great book for the intermediate Flash designer who likes a challenge"
2,Not Logical,"Although there are some wonderful projects in this book, it seems to get priorities on explanations backwards. Brutally simple and painfully basic portions of each project are almost explained to death, but when it comes to explaining complex portions (where you would need and explanation), it just says do it (with no real explanation)."
2,Book fails to explain ActionScript's underlying logic,"In trying to make the tutorial examples look attractive the producers of the book seem to have lost sight of the primary intention: to explain the functioning of ActionScripting. All too often, page after page is filled with detailed descriptions concerning the placement of decorative elements, and then the ActionScript is simply listed without any explanation of its underlying logic - useless if the reader wants to use the book to increase her ability to create her own scripts, rather than simply slavishly follow the given examples."
3,Flash 4 Magic,"This book strictly a tutorial. It walks you through step-by-step for creating a lot of neat stuff. If you are looking for an advance reference book, this book is not for you."
5,I got it!,"Short n sweet: I bought this manual so I could figure out how to use targets properly in flash4. Its in every chapter. I figured it out. Sseriously, thanks Scott and Daivd, (and New Riders of course)... I will continue to recommend this excellent workbook 'down under'"
2,Nice but not for advanced users,I recently ordered this book assuming it would give me some detailed answers on ActionScript. I soon found out it wouldn't satisfy my needs.It's a step-by-step tutorial-like book on creating some (not all [useless]) features like a guestbook and a poll.If you're a beginner: it's a nice (not great!) book.If you're an advanced flash-user knowing some actionscript and basic techniques like using external datasources: don't buy it! it's a waste of money since it won't learn you something new. It can give you some inspiration though.I would advice you to buy a book like 'Flash Bible'
3,An ActionScripting Source Book for Right Brainers,"This book is excellent if you are a designer who cannot grasp ActionScripting. Although the tutorials are not meant to teach you the logic behind actionscripting--the scripting they give you can be modified to suit your own needs--so basically, you're paying to get script that you can cut and paste into your own Flash creations.Personally, I think the authors should have sold the CD only as an ActionScripting Source CD. There really is no need for the printed pages."
2,This book is terrible,"It's a fabulous concept: simple, no-nonesense step-by step instructions, project based learning.But they go WAY too far in minimizing the ""discussion."" NOTHING is explained in any kind of useful, helpful detail. Some of the directions are so confusing and unclear it is positively infuriating. This book is very frustrating if you are an intermediate Flash user, trying to learn how to be a more advanced Flash user, because this book isn't designed to teach people Flash - if you're advanced enough not to need further explaination than is given in this book, then you're advanced enough not to NEED this book in the FIRST place!I don't recommend purchasing this book until such time as they revise it."
2,not recommended,"When I first purchased this book, I was honestly excited about what I thought would be an upper-level Flash text which delved into the nuances of Action Scripting. Instead, I got a book with 15 or so tutorials with no explanation of how they work. You can easily find this code on the web - for free. Ironically, very similar tutorials can be found as freeware on websites maintained by the authors! There are also typos in a couple of the examples, which are still not listed on the book's support website. The PHP ""Guestbook"" tutorial in particular does not work. I only found this out after tracking down the email address for the author of that particular chapter. About half of each page in the book is wasted on redundant screenshots which are useless - particularly in an advanced text. A final note: when I asked one of the author's (via email) why there weren't explanations as to how the tutorials worked, he replied that there wasn't enough space to include them! hmmm..."
3,"Create Special Flash effects, without ever figuring out how.","The stuff in there is great, lots of neat projects and super slick stuff . . . but as I was creating the projects, I didnt learn anything.I type all these actionscripts without even having a clue as to what it means (other than deduction). I'd almost prefer a step by step B&W explanation of the actionscript code and how it works than full color paint by numbers.On the other hand, there are no other decent Flash books for experienced users out there . . .I have mixed feelings about this book. The projects are great but after you finish them, you still don't *know* how to do it.-Drew"
2,Brace Yourself...,"Aside from maybe a couple of neat tricks, the auther(s) assumes that you are already an intermediate or advanced stage user of the program. The instructions were very abrubt and non-detailed and the action scripts were barely explained. Basically you were shown an example and inside of what can be considered 4-5 pages (with the graphics) it took you through the whole chapter. The chapters followed no real continuity and the cd ""add-on"" software was all shareware so if you want to use them more than 30 days you better be prepared to spend an additional $100-$150 to register them. In short, if your not at least an intermediate to advanced user, you may want to look elsewhere. You won't make it past the first chapter."
4,The 8th Wonder of Ultilizing Flash,"Thanks to David Emberton, Scott Hamlin, Scott Balay and the contributor Larry Larsen. I couldn't get a book here in India. So I had to borrow from my frind. I have read it 3 times. It is azamingly done. It takes to Think Flash. It is simply Superb. Hope it will come to India soon. I am also trying to get it by other means. I have published a review on this book on our regional magazine 'Kreators'. Thanks again."
1,Far too dismal a story,"Luke fears he is going crazy. He is the only one who can hear the sounds of the ""night train"" of the title...and no one believes him. With the exception of Luke's youngest sister and his girlfriend, there is no one in Luke's life that even wants to help him. Does Luke really hear it? Or is it only in his mind?I wanted to like this book, but overall the plot was just too implausible for me. The book moves back and forth in time and since the story begins with Luke's death, we already know how the book ends. All in all, I found it difficult to get myself involved in Luke's world and it's mostly unsympathetic characters."
4,Not the best reading club book but useful . . .,"Some in the Idiot's Guides series are pretty good, some are pretty dreadful; this one falls somewhere in the middle. Not all of his advice on locating an existing reading group is sound -- library-based groups are necessarily as open to the general public as those sponsored by chain bookstores -- nor is his advice to buy multiple new copies of books rather than used ones. He's much better on what makes for a successful new group -- how to choose members, how to choose which books to read, how to pace a discussion, and how to make sure everyone is included. And most of his thematic lists of books to consider are quite reasonable, except for the very short shrift he gives science fiction. (He seems to think ""genre"" fiction means primarily mystery novels.) My main complaint about this book is the cutesyness common to the whole series, but if can ignore that there's some pretty good stuff here."
5,Awesomeness...But...,"I use this all the time, i got to admit i wish it could really look at the moon like it shows in some pictures but dang good product am happy with it, thought i changed some lenses and its way awesomes now :) BUT as you know theres always a but somewhere :( YOU have to change the lense to get a better picture and it can cost you a pretty penny. :)"
1,False advertising,I expected an oldies but goodies cd; however less than half of the 20 songs were the original recordings. Some of the songs sounded as if they had been re-recorded in the past decade by the original artist. Not worth the small price to pay for it; false advertising as I see it.
1,"Overpriced, ya think?","Really? $106 for a Christmas CD? Is it made of 24k gold, made on Mars, etc? To add insult to injury Amazon doesn't even list the contents of the CD. I'm quite certain that most songs on this CD can be found by the same artists on other compilations. I guess there is a fool born every minute, hopefully not stupid enough to shell out $106 or $39 to the other seller. To all you folks who are going to blast me for my non-review, go ahead. I just feel that ripping off customers with overpriced CDs like this merits condemnation!"
4,Two greats in harmony..simply breathtaking!,"The love songs on this cassette are wonderful, Tammy and George..together again! ""One"" is absolutely gorgeous..What Ever Happened To Us..breath taking!"
4,Works well,I had a need to drill holes through a 4 inch thick concrete septic tank. I drilled two holes without issues. I have the drill bit ready for any future needs.
4,Reminiscent of a Friday Night Thriller,"Set in small town America in the 1970s, HAUNTED HOUSE OF THE VAMPIRE is a great young adult horror tale by baseball writer Bruce Markusen. The story of Kenny Odom takes the reader on a grand adventure that starts in Kenny's basement where he discovers the body of a vampire and unknowingly sets the creature free, bringing him back into mortal society. With haunted attics, graveyards and the ever scary basement, Markusen manages a fantastical tale that keeps the reader enthralled, waiting impatiently for the next twist in Kenny's saga. Reminiscent of a friday night thriller special, HAUNTED HOUSE OF THE VAMPIRE makes for the perfect Halloween read. - Angelique Armae."
3,Not the song I thought,"I love Johnny Cash but I choose the wrong cd. I meant to get the one where he is playing Spanish music, I didn't know he had worked with a Spanish band."
3,It has problems!!!,"I got this knowing from other reviews that I have read it could stop working properly or not work at all soon after I buy it, but I thought maybe it was just a fluke with these other parents. So I got it but kept the box and reciept, it's a excellent toy if there are no problems that arise, but about 3 hours after I bought it would not scroll through the pages half the time and when we touched the screen it would not play the right sounds with that page it was on. We never dropped it or anything, I even replaced the batteries twice the same day I got it to see if that was the problem, but it still was acting up a lot, so the next day I took it back and got a refund, if you want to try it just keep the reciept and the box 'cause you might have to take it back.But if it did work good it is a lot of fun, but it's very hard to see in dark rooms you need sunlight or a bright room to play with it, it really needs a backlight."
2,poor quality,"After one month the toy quit working. When I contacted the company, they had me cut the microphone and send it in to them and they send me a new system. After another month, this one quit too. Gave up and threw in the trash. Given the cost of the cartridges and the poor quality I would not advise purchasing this."
2,"Happily Ever After, The Drew Barrymore Story","The Furman sisters brought Drew Barrymore to life in the biography. The detailed description throughout the book chronicles Drew's life and that of her famous family. It was revealed that Drew's drug and alcohol addictions were part of a family tradition that dated back to her famous grandfather, John Barrymore. This quick read will give you a ""real"" insight into what it is like to be a star in the 20th and 21st. centuries."
3,Why Do Working Class People Vote Against Their Economic Interests?,I have not read the book. But I have read some of the writings of Wayne Flint. There are many excerpts from the book in this article...[...]
4,Original and usefull texture effects,"Chuck full of texture effects for words. There are about 40 effects and which are described step by step. This book isn't for the cheaters who just want to do Eyecandy plugin's fire effect. Each step is explained in detail and has a picture with it. After all the steps are shown, there are 2 or 3 examples on how to make the same effect look slightly different to give it a more custom look just for your needs. This is one of the few Photoshop books I keep. I've sold more than 1/2 of the Photoshop books I've boughten, so that does mean alot."
2,fm radio,outdated product; broke shortly after use; likely there are better mp3 players out there for $30.00; go with Sansdisk models
2,"The handle says, ""I'm melting! I'm melting!""","One reason I wanted a silicone turner so I wouldn't add to my collection of plastic cooking utensils that have melted handles when I lean them against the edge of the pan while cooking. Well, this turner has now has a nice melted indentation on the handle. I suppose I should have read the description a little closer as it does mention a rubber handle.The turner part is fine (and made out of silicone so it won't melt), although I find its edges a little too flexible."
4,pretty good slotted turner,"This slotted turner seems pretty good so far. I was tired of cheap turners that would break under pressure, so I bought this one because it seemed durable. It is very sturdy and so far it's worked well. It slips under whatever it is I am trying to turn much easier than the previous ones I had and it is also much easier to clean - the grease comes off much quicker, probably because of the material (silicone instead of nylon or plastic).The only downsides I find are the weight (it's kind of heavy), and the angle between the head and the handle (I would prefer a more curved handle with a sharper angle between the head and the handle)."
5,Is it possible....,"for me to have fallen in love with a food flipper? I LOVE this turner! It is so sturdy and substantial. I never have to worry about my turner bending if I am dealing with a heavy item. The entire thing is metal and the turner part is covered over in silicone. No more melted edge of my turner, this still looks brand new. I would buy it again in a heartbeat, I HIGHLY recommend it!!! Also would look very stylish in a modern, stainless steel, kitchen."
5,Excellent Product,"Excellent product, can flip eggs with ease. Finally a turner that won't scratch and can flip eggs without destroying them."
1,"Fine, if you like eating silicone.","Worked great at first. However, a couple months later, I noticed that upon close inspection, the edge of the silicone turner appeared frayed or chipped. I assume that small pieces of silicone broke off intermittently, and wound up in the food."
3,Pretty decent episode,"Pretty decent episode-definitely not a classic though. The plot is quite creepy-an obvious remake of the greek mythology idea of Sirens (creatures who lured men to them with their singing only to devore them), but not in a way that makes the plot seem stupid and contrived. While it's not anything to brag about, it's an alright episode, and introduces another alien culture. The ""marriage ceremony"" is also quite interesting. It's definitely not an ensemble piece though-the plot basically centers around Ensign Harry Kim, with the rest of the crew just adding a bit of substance."
3,Good,"I very much like the idea and some of the information in this book. HOwever, I would have liked to see more pictures. COnsidering I bought this book because I don't live in Maui and can't go visit all the places before the wedding, It woulod have been good to picture them."
2,Disappointed,Was very disappointed that the vitamins were expired when I received them. Would not recommend purchasing this particular item to anyone.
4,Two versions of this book?,"We're confused because there are two versions of this book. In the edition we borrowed from our library, Herb is going to walk the plank. Our son loved the book so much we bought a copy for our home...but the edition we own talks about the executioner getting ready to behead Herb. The first version was pushing it, but the beheading is just not appropriate at all. Otherwise, our son really loves this story but I agree that it misses the boat a bit on promoting vegetarianism, since the meat-eaters still eat animals."
4,a little violent,"got this book for my 5 year old. it was suprised to find it a little violent (pacifists), but my son still loves it."
3,"Not for my kids, it seems","If you're trying to form a moral foundation for your child, this might not be the right book for you and your children. As a vegan, I have started a children's book collection...being a vegan in a not so vegan world, I thought this might help my future children feel as though there is a place for them in literature as well. Yet if you sincerely believe that it is unethical to eat meat or any other animal products for that matter, I would not recommend this book because the concluding point is that either way it does really matter in the end. Granted, Herb is a very sweet dragon."
2,Oddly Violent,"My boys like this book, but I really don't. There is an odd undercurrent of implied violence in this book - e.g. dragons crunching princesses, knights making the dragons walk the plank to their death (they don't actually die, just the threat of it).Unfortunately there is a shortage of any decent books for young children about being vegetarian, so I guess this will have to do for now."
2,Way too violent for the under 7 crowd,"My 3-year old is a vegetarian, and I thought this was going to be a sweet story about...well, Herb the Vegetarian Dragon. But the story was so violent, with people-eating and evil dragon singing and executions and blades and beheading, I had to alter most of the story as I was reading it. It's going back to the library quickly."
3,Let's all just get along.,"This story tries very hard to teach a message: there's room for diversity (of eating habits in this case), and let's find a way to solve our conflicts non-violently. That sounds all well and good but I found the story to be too preachy. I think the message went right over my preschoolers' heads, but it might be appropriate for older children as part of a school lesson on respecting differences. My kids picked it out and I didn't pre-screen it before bringing it home, so I was a little disturbed to find the dragons munching and crunching on princesses and knights on the first couple of pages. The story also referred to the dragons as ""evil"" and yet at the end everyone becomes friends - after threatening the dragons with being eaten alive by alligators. The drawings are quite lively but overall, I didn't think this was the strongest book in this genre. For a similar theme without the gore and war references, try ""Giraffes Can't Dance""."
2,WRONG AGE GROUP!!!,"I have to agree with the writer from Frenchtown, NJ--this book is much to violent and innapropriate for a 4 year old. Though I don't disagree with the subject manner, the gory details are just too bloody. I think it would be a great book for kids 7 or 8 and up."
3,Stop the slaughter!,"Pleasant artwork, and a good story. Although I have not yet converted to vegeterianism as a result of this tome, I have vowed to quit killing dragons."
3,beautiful art but mixed messages,"...is just beautiful--the art throughout the book is the same colorful, vivid style as on the cover. However--there's a lot of text which makes it somewhat tedious for beginning readers, and I was rather shocked by both the text and pictures--even though the protagonist is veg, the book's message is more about tolerance for others' choices then portraying any one dietary choice as better than any other. ... This book leaves out the ""why"" of vegetarianism, which is for many parents the main thing they are trying to make clear to their children when buying a pro-veg book such as this. My personal qualms with the foggy message and the violence depicted are such that if it wasn't for the AWESOME artwork I would consider actually getting rid of it...."
5,Don't eat people,"I adore this book, and my five year old delights in it as well. The message is excellent -- some people (and dragons) like to eat meat, some people (and dragons) like to eat veggies, and no one should eat people. I like that it isn't the least bit preachy. I happen to be a vegetarian, and my husband and child are not, and it isn't about one kind of eating being better than another, just different. If you have a ""mixed"" eating family like mine, or if your meat eating child has vegetarian friends, or your vegetarian child has meat eating friends, or if you enjoy any well-written, well-illustrated children's book, then this book belongs on your shelf."
4,This was a great book!,"I went out in search of a few good books on vegetarianism to read to my four-year-old son. This story is great; it is so real! (Despite the main characters being dragons, of course.) The message at the end is wonderful: ""I won't ask you to change your habits/ideas/principles if you don't ask me to change mine"".Just FYI: the story was written by Jules Bass of Rankin/Bass fame (Frosty the Snowman, The Last Unicorn, Rudolph the Rednosed Reindeer)."
1,"Vegetarians, don't buy this book","Don't buy this book if you believe it's wrong to hurt and kill animals. The message of this book is it's not OK to kill people and eat them (the knights) but it's just fine to kill animals and eat them. The artwork is lovely. But as a vegan, I'm sad I spent my money on this."
4,Very good price !,For $40 it was a bargain. Dial appears slightly bigger than expected. Everything else was fine.
4,I worth a good product on amazon,"The product arrived on good conditions, this watch have a good envelop and it have a excellent desing."
5,Could be Waylon's greatest album.....,"If you love Waylon, don't miss the oppurtunity to purchase this album.Along with Dreaming My Dreams and Are You Ready For The Country, this record displays the best sides of Waylon. Several of the songs are auto-biographical and his sense of humor stands out here more than any other release."
5,Killer Waylon!,one of my favorite Waylon Jennings albums...my third favorite if i was held at gunpoint and told to decide...his backing band was awesome during this era...
1,Didn't work,"I ordered this to replace my antenna on my Motorola i730 phone and it did not fit. The threads were not compatible with the phone, and the threaded fitting was too long in comparison to the original piece. Also, the picture shows a black antenna and the one I got was grey...Don't buy this!"
2,Nortech Navigator GPS010-Bummer,"What a shame! no updates! thank god I bought this gps 2nd hand. Very limited as all the listings for updates in the manual are non-existant and no uploads are available. Wasted my $$. Save your bucks and get a Garmin or another ""trusted"" name in a GPS."
4,Great Value but Poor Support,"This GPS is fantastic. It is very easy to use and gives good directions. It lacks some bells and whistles such as bluetooth for your cel phone, sound through your car stereo, MP3 player, etc. But is this stuff really worth double or triple the price? Overall, it is a very good buy. But, there is no customer/technical support. The website in the manual is for the software provider and is not even Nortech. I will soon be spending a great deal of time in Toronto, Canada. And, I am having a very difficult time figuring out what software to buy in order to load the Canadian maps.UPDATE July 19th, 2007: after using a few months, the car adaptor broke. It was an unusual voltage not even supported by universal adapters. And, I was unable to locate a replacement. This makes the GTS relatively useless. Order with caution. I would now reduce my stars rating if it was allowed."
1,Nortech Service is Bad,"My wife bought this through Sam's Club and the car charger broke. Sam's says it was a closeout and doesn't sell cords and the ferros - the distributor says the GPS is no longer made. I have looked on the net for hours and been to Radio Shack, Best Buy, and Circuit City and the car charger insert is a unique size and cannot be matched.Don't buy this one. I bought my son a GPS (garmin) for 1/2 the price and it works twice as well."
3,Great introduction but then...,"This book starts out at a level someone who is not a current undergraduate math student can understand, and I appreciate the limited number of math proofs in this book. But, basic error correction coding is all but useless except for theory and basic understanding. When the text finally gets to useful topics like Reed-Solomon codes, the text gets terse and very difficult to follow and the targeted audience moves to a current graduate math student level. The author was obviously very rushed to finish the book. Chapter 7 (this book's MOST important chapter) needs to be rewritten. I did not study Chapter 8."
2,Not very impressed,"Being a huge Beth Moore fan, I bought this book in a heartbeat and was disappointed. It is written by many Christian writers on various topics concerning women but I found it to be rather shallow."
3,"""A Woman and Her God"" Falls Short","I was mildly frustrated when reading this book. While it touched on some good topics, it is often too broad to be really helpful and it seems poorly edited at times including some redundancies between chapters. We used it in a Sunday School Class setting. There were no discussion questions. The book has a strong focus on married women (to the point where I felt the title should have been called ""The Married Woman and Her God""). While this was helpful to those of us who were married, it was somewhat alienating to our single women."
5,Outstanding!,"I loved reading this book! Every chapter is written by a different author and all not only give in depth Biblical knowledge, but also practical knowledge that will touch the heart of any woman. I learned so much and enjoyed the read! This is a great gift for any wife, daughter, aunt or girlfriend. A must read!"
2,Where is the Promo CD?,"Both the regular release and the Gold edition have bits of dialogue in them that is particularly annoying. there are only 7 tracks of actual score, and the rest are all other artists and talking. I know there was a promotional release that was 12 tracks of score, but I can't find it ANYWHERE. you would think, with all the soundtrack lovers out there, they would make a killing with a re-release of the Promo CD..."
4,Music to Groove to!,"BOTTOM LINE:Nicolay, the BetterMan from the Netherlands, makes music that makes you want to move, and makes you feel good! This CD is full of instrumentals that begs you to hop in your car, fill up the tank, and take a nighttime cruise thru the 'City Liiiiiiiights!'holla.Grade: A"
4,A Wealth of Information on the Loving Search for God,"An excellent and practical guide to the reasons for/results of contemplative prayer. A wonderful resource for anyone involved in any Christian healing prayer. Explains how our emotional ""programs"" are healed through contemplative prayer and what the symptoms of that healing are. There are three tapes in this set and the third tape is confusing and repeats almost verbatim sections from the first two tapes. Nonetheless, it is extraordinarily informative and helpful. Do yourself a favor and get this book."
3,"Too much talk, not enough contemplation.","I read the other reviews and knew that there was a lot of talk, but truly there was almost no guided meditation whatsoever. Maybe five minutes worth. The rest was talking about Contemplative Prayer and the benefits of it, but there was almost no actual meditative content. Very disappointing."
3,Kind of rambles,"I liked the discussion of contemplative prayer techniques. However, I could have gone without the child psychology lecture that takes up the first 2 out of 3 CD's."
4,Tales of A British Family in WWII India,"The author gives us a look at what life was like for her family stationed with the British Civil Service in India during WWII. Her mother kept fine records and journals of their travels and adventures while managing a home, husband, children, pets and servants under difficult circumstances. She was able to do it with quite a bit of humor and resourcefulness. The variety of characters and events chronicle an interesting account of a time and place in recent history that no longer exists."
3,Depressing,I read this book in a few hours and found it to be sad and depressing. No joy in it at all.
4,Beautiful.,"This is a poignant, delicately written novel with a heartrending ending and wistfully drawn characters. Beautifully drawn, the plot and characters move about in a world that's so familiar yet so alien, searching for a true home.Adrian will capture your heart immediately, and his situation is one so frequently discussed and portrayed but yet so uniquely discovered.Please, read this novel and you will not be disappointed. Yearning to be understood and loved, Adrian moves about the plot, watchful, careful, and many a time it almost brought tears to my eyes. Almost, but not quite.The plot gets just a little boring after awhile, but then the melancholy ending leaves the reader only wanting more."
2,"Except, that it's NOT the ""Highwaymen""","This is NOT a recording of The Highwaymen - a country music 'super group' consisting of Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson and Waylonn Jennings singing together. Instead it is a collection of solo performances by each of the artists. It is an import and probably used bootleg source material as the sound quality ranges from poor to mediocre. Don't waste your money. Amazon should not allow such a misleading description to be used in an ad."
1,"Not 42"" length!!","If your are going to advertise a size make sure that it actually is that size. The width was correct, but the length is only 40.5"". The old crate pan is 42"", the cage itself is 42"". Id love to know the logic behind saying its 42"" and it actually being 40.5"" Now I have to either pay to ship it back or keep it as is...."
3,Too narrow,"Although I bought this replacement pan for a MidWest Life Stages crate, the pan is about 2"" too narrow! Perfect length, but my big dog needs the width because she likes to curl up sideways. Her paws can get in between the sides of the pan and the crate with this replacement pan, so it is a no-go for us. You'd think if you were matching the brand name the fit would be better. Disappointing, because it seems nice and sturdy."
4,Sturdy replacement,Product is good. Feels sturdier than original tray provided. Would recommend putting cardboard underneath for padding to minimize risk of cracking against metal crate frame.
4,works well,slightly short(line an inch) but overall fit my petmate crate..took another reviews hint about using a layer of cardboard from the packing to line between crate and tray.. perfect
5,As Described,This crate pan is solid and serves its purpose. Arrived as promised and well packaged. Highly recommend. It's size is at described and fits the crate exactly.
3,Not as pictured....,"The description says MidWest replacement, but the packaging was GoGo replacement crate. The measurements are accurate and the pan fit. However, it is a smooth plastic and not the textured look pictured. The pan I'm replacing was for a borrowed crate, so I was trying to find as close a replica as possible. I would not have ordered this if the picture had not looked like an identical match."
5,Crate tray,This replacement tray seems to be made of a better material than the original tray that came with the crate. Very good.
2,"Product excellent, damaged due to poor packaging","2.0 out of 5 stars Poor Packaging, February 17, 2013By KENT L HELBERAmazon Verified Purchase(What's this?)This review is from: MidWest Life Stages Dog Crate Replacement Pan 42in (Misc.)No problem with the quality and function of the product. However, the outside packaging (cardboard box) was not sufficient to protect the pan. It was flimsy and light weight. The pan was fairly heavy and large. Not a good combination to prevent product damage. So the pan arrived with a damaged box and one corner had a 4 inch crack. The shipper needs to reevaluate the outside shipping container used for this product."
3,Good liner,"This crate liner was a bit more flimsy than I expected but has held up well so far. The liner was smaller than the crate by about 2 inches, meaning there is a gap in the crate and the liner."
5,Dog crate pan replacement,"Perfectly fitting replacement pan for our dog's crate. Midwest has quality products which we have used for years. The original pan was also a plastic material. We were seeking a metal pan for durability, however plastic is good, light, durable and probably more comfortable on the dog's legs and feet. The price for the product and shipping was good. Speed of shipping and delivery was extraordinary!"
4,"Works well, metal would be the better choice","This particular plastic kennel liner works well for us. We have a yellow lab mix and she can be very excitable, but it's been pretty resilient so far. For some reason, when we first got it, she thought that it tasted good and started to lick and (attepmpted to) chew the bottom of it. After a good washing with some soap and water, she didn't do it any more, so you should definately wash yours before use. While this liner will work well for most, if you have a particularly rough, or large dog, you're definately going to want to spend the extra on a metal liner, which will last forever, so the extra money is worth it."
5,GREAT!,"These last a long time, my Last one lasted over 6 years and I am guessing only got a crack from a high energy dog or puppy playing on it."
2,Not durable,"The shipping was great, but our dog broke it and chewed off the corner within a week. :( I really wanted it to last much longer."
1,Noisy,"It looked good, and worked well. However, when I put this device into a cigar jack, it made a noise. Thus, I gave up using this device while I am driving."
1,USB Charger does not work,"Unfortunately, the USB outlet will not work on the unit that I just purchased. Was promising to be totally awesome and I really did like the sound quality over the transmitter and both the AC power outlet and the 12 volt dc output worked well. But I really need the USB charger, otherwise would have way to many devices crowding that area. Am returning it tomorrow."
4,Does what it says but noisy.,This has a very noisy fan. I had to open it up and put oil on the fan bearings before i got it to become quiet. There is no rubber stop so i had to glue an oil cover in place. other than that this is a very good product. the fan should also have a temp limiter so it shuts off in cold weather.
2,not reliable,"I bought it and once used during the trip to Grand Canyon.The power inverter is OK but noise, however the transmitter function is really bad. The signal by the transmitter was so weak, it was only functional when we was Grand Canyon without any interference by public radio. After trip, the transmitter function stoped to working any more."
4,"great so far, we'll have to see in the long run","I just bought this unit, tried it out over the weekend...so far so good. I read the other review that said it died after a month, i'll have to see. It sounds like the may have blown the fuse, they did send a spare with it, and also you can pick them up online here or at many harware stores. Hard to say what happened. Anyway, It works great with my mp3 player and DVD player, and the brodcast is good, but i do wish it was a full fm range and not just 15 stations. I do have another transmitter, and when i got into larger cities, I used the whole range. But, for the versitility, you can't match this unit. It's universal for anything player, Ipods, zune, gigabeat,zen because it is a plug in, it has USB charge as well, is even has a lighter adapter for another device as well. Look around, you'll be back to get this one."
4,Makes a great gift,We gave this book as a gift. My father in law loves old War stories and absolutely loved this book!
1,Trivia,A very brief book which is collection of historical trivia. A few of them may pique your interest for a few seconds.
3,Light & Fluffy,"This book is fun so long as you don't ask much of it. Some events are oversimplified and everything is bite-sized. Probably better for general interest than for the military history buff. For me, it didn't last long enough to satisfy. That said, this makes a fine coffee table (or bathroom?) book. It's easy to pick up and put down since each story is very brief.Would I buy again? Probably not but I say that only as an avid student of military history. Others might enjoy it quite a bit."
3,"Fun, but brief and americanized","I read this regular book, here in Brazil. This book is very short and mainly correct, but it is also brief and americanized. About 90% of it are articles, about American military curiosities. Being fun, but also too brief and americanized leads me to give just three stars for this book."
2,Not what they claim!,"received my order on-time and complete. The problem is that they do not perform as advertised. After charging for 24 hours they held the voltage properly but would not operate my camera. The camera would come on, show low battery condition, and then the camera would shut down. I bought 4 and they all do the same thing. Maybe they are suited for other items but camera batteries they are not!John Kendall"
3,Not so great,This battery is OK for taking 1 to 5 pictures. After the first 5 to 8 pictures it would lose charge quickly and the camera would shut down. I have to get the battery out and put it back in to start shooting again. This can be a big problem since it always happen at the wrong time. Not satisfied with the performance.
5,Strongly recommended reading for all aspiring practitioners of the art of debating,"Talk The Talk: Speech And Debate Made Easy by Alim Merali (a past Canadian Student Debating Federation National Champion and professional debate training expert) methodically explains the tools and strategies necessary for students to excel at debate. Merali illustrates key concepts with examples and includes full debates with commentary and analysis. Coverall all of the key areas that student debaters need to know in order to succeed, Talk The Talk discusses how to craft and deliver speeches effectively, explains what it takes to win rounds, provides special focus on two essential debate skills (developing top-notch arguments and clashing with the other team's points), and surveys techniques for specific style of parliamentary, cross- examination, and forum debating. Talk The Talk is essential, strongly recommended reading for all aspiring practitioners of the art of debating."
5,Great Songs from Great Movies!,"There are too many wonderful songs, each a treasure, to mention them all. It is enough to say that the best from Berlin's movie musicals are included here. Among the many are ""Sisters"" and the title song from White Christmas, ""Top Hat, White Tie and Tails,"" ""Cheek to Cheek,"" and ""Steppin'Out."" My friends and I have enjoyed this book so much I am ordering others in the Berlin series. A great collection of songs by one of America's greatest composers."
2,Photo is deceptive,"If you're looking for the ducks and bears, this is probably not for you. The package contains 90% blue and pink confetti shown in the background; there are perhaps six of the ducks and bears. This was a real disappointment to me as I was looking for this to match the rest of the ""baby me"" decor.Otherwise, there's nothing wrong with the confetti."
4,"""little mouse""","I read this book at Christmastime to my "" kindermusik class.""They were throughly charmed by little mouse's explorations.The illustrations were very sweet and the children could identify with the plate of cookies,the cup of hot chocolate,the velvet stocking.etc.The simplicity in words was also appropriate."
2,Another Day? Another Book!,"I don't imagine that anyone of any age could make it through this disappointing and boring novel, about a 14 year old who wants her parents back together."
4,You can't put it down!!!,The Night Cry is one of the best books I have ever read!! It is about a young girl and her father. The girl's father gets a job and she has to stay alone for a week. Some unexpecting things happen when she is there. She winds up trying to rescue a small boy that was kidnapped out of his own room. I chose this book because I like horses and on the cover there was a horse. My favorite character was the Grandma because she was funny and mysterious. Everyone in town thought she was crazy. The best part was when the girl was in the barn trying to find out a way to rescue the boy. She finally busted out of the barn on the horse. I liked that part because she hadn't ridden the horse since her brother got kicked off and was killed. The only bad thing about this book is that it is very predictable. Otherwise it was very good!!
2,Postmodernism,Erudite to the extreme if you consider erudition to be an encyclopaedic knowledge of authors and quotes but that is not what I am looking for in a beginner's guide.
3,"OK, SO ITS SIMPLE...","Personally, the little organizer does me just fine:O)That's all it really is...no better than a childs ""dear electric diary."" For those that have needs beyond a calender, scheduler, and phone book...DON'T BUY IT!By the way... what did ya expect for around $20 bucks????????"
2,"Royal, Oh Really?","[[ASIN:B00005MJUZ Royal Excelsior 384kb memory touch sreeen organizer, 6-line backlit display, PC sync software]The touch screen is dark and there is a line through the touch screen apparently some latent defect. You have to use this in a well lit area. This organizer is definitely not as good as the Sharp organizer but what can you expect from obsolete technology that is no longer in production."
4,"Great PDO, but battery installation is tricky!","This is a great PDA/PDO for the price, especially the newer model with 768k. With both items, however, installing the batteries is tricky. The instruction booklet is wrong. There is NO screw to loosen. You have to use something with a small pointed tip to pry open the battery door just above the 2 wavy lines representing finger impressions. While I'm glad that the door is a very snug fit, I nearly returned the item to the seller because I, like other buyers, did not think I would ever figure out how to install the darn batteries!"
2,A Mixed Review,"1) Backlighting never worked.2) Finicky touch screen -- takes fair amount of practice.3) After about six months, grew more and more erratic at accepting input -- frequently won't change functions at all, and bottom two rows of ""keyboard"" have stopped working altogether.4) The organizer software is OK, but... when trying to print out reports/to-do lists/etc, each entry prints ON A SEPARATE PAGE, even when following the instructions that -say- will generate a regular list.If it worked reliably for more than a few months, it might be a worthwhile buy for the (discounted) price. But from my own experience, and the other reviews here, I'd have to say this was not a good purchase, and I won't be buying another of this brand."
4,Excellent Price - Packed with features!,"I found this at Wal-Mart and at a much lower price than most of those advertised on the Internet. This little beauty was ranked by a tech review magazine as one of the best! I have found that it is awesome to be able to open up my address book and send all the info to my Excelsior PDA. It also comes with software to make all kinds of info available to sync between your PC and PDA.Things I don't like: Sensitive; sometimes duplicates numbers or letters when you are putting them in with the stylus. Easy enough to fix, just learn how much pressure to use when entering things and until you get the hang of it just hit delete to remove the duplicate letter or number.Also, the glo backlit display could be brighter, and I have found that the screen is not easy to read in dim light or ""lightbulb"" light. Its best read outside or in flourescent light."
2,Decent introduction to hand helds.,I bought it because it was cheap. I got what I paid for. The touch screen controls are finicky. I've encountered problems with the Sync software and find that not all appointments show up.The positive thing that I can say is that I see the benefits have agood hand held and I will be ugrading for Christmas.
1,XXXcelsior,"I received my Excelsior as a Christmas gift. After approximately 2 months it stopped working. I called the customer service number that came the organizer and never got past customer service. I kept getting the runaround I found it again last week on my dresser and was goin to return it to the company, since it is no use to me. Your warranty stinks or the people taking care of the warranties don't know what they are doing. I will know not to buy one of your products again and will let others know also. Also, the sync would not work, both omputers have Microsoft Outlook."
1,WASTE OF TIME!!!!,"I would never recommend this item to even a child, this is a waste of time and money! DO NOT BUY!I bought this product expecting to get a half way decent PDA to store some of my info that I use daily, however I was very disappointed with the item because when I got it it had black line that ran the full length of the screen and was very frustrating to maneuver around when hitting desired parts of the screen. Also don't be fooled by the way the picture looks, nothing like that. And linking to outlook.........better forget that too! Overall bad item!"
1,"Item Defective, Returned Item promptly, Seller did not refund","What else is there to say? if you are selling a candy mold that is suppodly designed to make candy, then if the item ""collapses"" when you pour the hot sugar mixture into the mold, AND you BURN yourself, then, why not refund the purchase entirely AND go back to the manufacturer? First time we had a mold fail. Returned item at my own expense with a letter explaining the mold FAILED and I ended up in Urgent Care with 3rd degree burns. Seller wrote letter back and said ""Item was used so we are going to give you a partial refund."" How about I send them the bill for the injuries sustained as a result of a poor quality product?Avoid .... this ..... Seller"
1,Just Say No,"If you really want to make candy and want something worthwhile move on. This is flimsy, cheap plastic and not worth the price."
3,it's ok....,"not really into the whole paper bag test and how that actually affects everyone even to this day...it's sad. I am a brown woman and this took away from the story for me. Pretty good, though."
3,"Interesting story, poorly written","The subject of this memoir, Josephine Premice, should have made this book a fascinating read. I was very interested to learn about the experiences of Premice, Diahann Carroll, and other Black divas of their generation. I also was intrigued to learn about the personal story of this mixed race family. However, Ms. Fales-Hill's writing style interfered with my enjoyment of the subject matter. Her writing is precious and self-conscious. The author seemed to be trying too hard to impress the reader with her intelligence and Harvard education. What was lost in this effort was emotional impact and a clear sense of what Ms. Premice was really like as a person."
5,Always Wear Joy ...... Is a lesson everyone can learn,"Her Name is Josephine Premice . Mother, wife, sister ,friend, singer, actress , dancer, WOMAN. This book is both impowering and beautiful . A true testiment to the MOTHER-Daughter relationship . This book is written with love and it shows .A life a a true legend and a woman well beyond this or any time . And im only up to page 181 of 280"
5,Just like the original.,"The rings appear to the same as those that came with the blender originally: same heft, feel and size. Fits just right."
2,A package doesn't include and it has reached openly. oster original commercialization isn't understood somehow.,"These goods aren't included in a package, and commercializing of real oster isn't understood somehow. It's a little expensive, but though this store was chosen, it's regrettable."
2,More rings per package,"The o-rings we ordered came in individual packages. The rings should be packaged in numbers of three or ten. The rings are light in weight, but still requires the minimal shipping fee because of the weight of the packaging. Even in numbers of 10, the shipping fee should be the same, because of less excess packing materials."

Unfortunately, author Hopp does not have Paul Duncan's ability of a dynamic picture/text mix, so what we get is many oversized pictures of little particular relevance, no flow continuity - Wilder, think only of his Some like it hot (1959) or One, two, three (1961), was an expert at pacing and action! How undeserved, what a pity!fbus 83 - Hopp-Wilder Missing the beat - 21/1/2013"
4,A classical groove for the Phish Phan!,"For the dinner party when you want to get your Phishy Groove on, but don't want your guests to know you are a Phan, this cd is perfect. String quartet covers of Phish tunes are perfect for sunday morning lazing in bed with your mountain girl, for long drives with your parents, basically any situation where you want to be the undercover wolfman's brother. If you've listened to a lot of Phish, it will be hard not to sing along with YEM, Julius or Down with Disease. Whie farmhouse and billy breathes could have been replaced with more poignent selections (Chalkdust? Twist?), Rift has wonderful bluegrass flavor, and run like an antellope closes the set classicly. If you enjoy Bela Fleck's Perpetual Motion or any of the Pickin' on series you will enjoy this CD."
4,Great Accessory Package,Nintendo DS is great for traveling and this accessory packages is exactly what you need to go along with it.
5,Travel Kit Value!,This was the hit of my gifts to my daughter... VERY good quality fro the price!Mary S-R
3,Just a little too small for everything,"When I got this I placed my games in the white game case and stored it in the bag with the the extra stylus. When I placed the game on the other zippered compartment I found that it was difficult to zipper it shut. A very, very snug fit. I wish it a tad bit bigger. Now I just use the case to hold all my games and accessories and leave the DS unit out of it. That is why I give it 3 out of 5 stars...nice bag to carry the all accessories."
5,nice product,"It has what I needed and I'm impressed so far.I did a lot of accessory searching for my DS Lite before buying this kit - sight unseen - because it had the kind of accessories I needed and the one and only feedback so far was very favorable. I hadn't been to fond of much of the accessories for DS Lite so far, but I took a leap of faith with this one hoping for the best."
3,flimsy case,The soft case is junk! If you manage to pack the DS and the game case ( the chargers will not fit) into it it is so tight that if you drop it it would be just as bad as dropping the DS without the case. I went to a discount store and bought a ten dollar CD case that holds everything nicely. The car charger and the earbuds are nice but I threw the case away.
4,nintendo travel kit,"i purchased 2 of these for my sons new nintendos, that they will get for christmas, these will be perfect for their ds systems, and trips in the car."
4,Nice DS Lite kit,"So I got this kit for my kids. It's a functional kit and has worked well so far. The extra stylus is nice and the pen holder for the stylus' has made it more comfortable to use them. My kids love the ear buds, especially since they can sit next to each other and share one each. They have not used the large rubber game keeper case, but it really wouldn't fit good with the game system inside at the same time. Besides one side of the pouch has little 'pockets' for a few games and so they kids stick them there and then put the ear buds and the wall power cord in as well. The car charger is nice and takes about 2 1/2 hours to fully charge the unit. Over all a great buy!"
3,Leave Home Without It,"The success of the Nintendo DS has brought so many smiles to young faces all over the country. Although the system has really done well in its original version, and the DS Lite, there are some companies who make accessories that aren't even as close to par. This Nintendo DS Lite Travel Kit is sadly not something that hits the nail on the head. There are a lot of accessories here that don't work very well, from the lackluster ability of the stylus, to the battery charger which has malfunctioned after only a few uses. Although the ear buds and the convient traveling case handle well, as well as the game cases, it just doesn't completely do the job.Price: C-Coonvience: C 1/2-Overall: C-"
5,Worth it for the case alone,"This is a ""standard"" travel kit: case, car charger, extra stylus, screen protectors ...The case is really good, designed for the DS Lite. It has a few pockets for games, a separate compartment for the DS itself, and enough room for ~ 10 games, a charger, and headphones -- all in a small package."
4,Good accessories,"This is a good product. The only thing is you have to be very careful to stick your protective filter for the ds screens. There is a soft card included for you to smooth out bubbles. There aren't any instruction, therefore when I first peel the backing..I thought that was the one o stick it on...but actually that's not....so...I got dust on it already. Beside that, everything is very thoughtful. I like the game case that you can change one side to a holder for gb advance games. The small screen cleaning patch is cute and still useful. Neat kit. The downside is that I order this product from Amazon with my Prime 2 day delivery, I still end up receiving it on the 4th day. Not very nice experience with the prime membership. I'll give it a third try...if next time I still get my item more than 2 days, I'll just cancel my membership...why pay more, right?!"
3,Is this it?,"This is not what I expected at all. The case is entirely TOO small. I thought I would be able to put everything I needed in it: game sys., adapter, games, car charger. What a waste of money I could have bought the aluminum safe case for $10 more or even less depending on where I purchased it."
1,WAY too small to fit everything,"If you're looking for a case that will fit the DS plus all the accessories, LOOK ELSEWHERE! I purchased this case because the zipper on my old case busted, but I went back to my old broken case because I actually liked it better! Even with one zipper broken, it still fits more stuff than this piece of junk (and it's almost the same size). The only things that will fit in this case are the DS, earphones, stylus pens (but NOT the pen extender), and maybe three game cartridges. I guess it's OK for kids, but if you want a carry-all case that would also fit the charger, cartridge holder, etc., this is not the one."
2,Disappointed in the quality,"The first time we put the DS in the zipper pouch, the zipper split apart. Unlike a previous reviewer, ours will not zip back together. Also, there is a circular plastic piece on the charger that popped out (actually into the charger) the first time we plugged it in. The game case and stylus extender are fine (which is why I'm giving it 2 stars) but the earphones fall out of my son's ears (not surprising for this price, though). Considering the price and hassle to ship it back, and the fact that some of the accessories are still useful, we're cutting our losses and buying a different model case. Overall, disappointing."
3,not really worth it!,"This product comes witha carrying case for your nintendo ds, a pen that holds a stylus,an attachable game holder (2 games), 2 extra styluses, another game holder that holds 15 games, a strap that can connect to your case to hold it around your neck, a screen protector, earbuds, a car charger, 2 memory chips, screen protector, and a piece of foamy plastic. the carrying cases zipper will break if you over stuff it, but if it does break it will go back together if you push the zipper back and forth a couple times. Ive used this product for about 6 months now and its great if you just bought a nintendo ds and need things to take care of it or your just traveling!! hope this was helpful to you!!!!!"
4,Handy Accessories...,"The accessories provided are well-designed and useful. However, the earphones provided CANNOT be used until ANOTHER accessory is purchased seperately allowing them to work!"
5,Convenient Travel Kit,"This travel case has it all...car charger, extra stylus, carry case and more. I particularly like the carrying case which holds about everything including the Nintendo ds. Appears well built; great buy for the $ spent."
3,"Some parts good, others less so","Just about everything was fine in this kit. I especially like the compact game card cases. I don't use my DS in the car, so I can't really say how well the car adapter works. My only real disappointment was the stylus holder, which would be nice to reduce fatigue holding the tiny stylus, but when I put the stylus in, I could see cracks in the plastic where it fit together, and there was a little bit of slop allowing the stylus to slide back and forth in the tube a little bit when you press down on the stylus tip, which got really annoying when you're trying to do things quickly in a game. I might try making a small block to stick in the tube to make it more solid, but it's not the best design."
3,Nice kit,This kit is very complete. The only negative thing is the case. I was able to put in the case for the games and I had a hard time closing it after I placed in the DS. The rest is great.
3,it's ok,Has a lot for my DS. I wish that it came in more colors than just a black case. Seems to work alright.
3,"Close, but no cigar","This is a cool case...and it would be even cooler if it actually HELD everything it claims it does. You can pack some of the game cases, and the wires and chargers, but if you do...there is no room for the game console itself. And there is no way the car charger fits in it unless it is completely empty. Nice construction...but was a disappointment. The gadgets are nice...but now we have to find case to hold it all! Save your money, skip the ""kit"" and just get the empty case. The console fits nicely, and the games will slip in the other side, no problem."
5,great quality at a great value,"i'm an obsessor with keeping my gadgets clean-- from my laptop to my nintendo. This kit is by far one of the best quality kits that I've seen available for my nintendo. It fits everything perfectly, the case is nice and padded, and the stylus holder is awesome. It is just what I needed... now i can play for even longer without my hands tiring. I would recommend this kit to anybody!"
4,Pretty good with a few minor problems,"Upon receiving my DS lite travel kit, I was amused at the annoyingly diffucult packaging. Whoever invented that type of packaging where the sides seem to be smelted together needs to be shot.As for the product itself, I really liked the soft case as it protects my games very well, but I found the earbuds to be rather flimsy, as they have already begun to fall apart.I haven't really used the other products in the kit.All in all, I recommend this if only for the soft case."
4,Travel Kit & Game Review,"The game is fine. The travel kit size and set-up was really nice but the quality was not. The zipper pull broke and the pen kept coming apart. I finally super glued it shut. The price did not equal the quality. Had it been $12 instead of $20, I wouldn't have been so up-set."
5,Travel Kit was Great Help,"Recently we bought Nintendo DS Lite travel kits for our two grandsons, ages 7 and 5, before going with them on a week's vacation to Californina. The boys used them faithfully and they were extremely handy when it came to keeping all of the game cartridges, ear phones, charger cords, etc. together. No digging through backpacks looking for accessories. Also, they enabled keeping each boy's accessories separate so there was never any argument over which items belonged to whom. They served well in protecting the game units as they were transported through airports, etc. Would recommend this even if travel is not in the plans."
5,Fantastic Mexican/Latin style rock,"I think I don't exaggerate if I compare Del Castillo to Great Los Lobos!This is fine electric and acoustic music, sometimes soft , sometimes hard.There is not very much information on booklet, but you cancopy more for example Del Castillo's page (www.delcastillomusic.com)."
1,No Color,This product is supposed to be burgandy. It was more a brownish orange color. I thought maybe the product would work after being applied to my hair. It didn't. There was no change in hair color at all after using according to directions. Would never buy again. What a waste of 10 dollars.
2,Burgundy Hair Cream,"I did not like this product. I used the Burgundy Color Shade. It did not change my hair color, except putting some shine into my hair."
3,Coast To Coast(1980) VHS.,"Coast to Coast is an Okay movie. Trucker Flick with a Cool GMC General Sleeper truck, mediocre acting and actors. silly plot. Robert Blake the Murderer is in it. I just got the movie at a cheap price originally before the whole blake thing because of te GMC truck in it. It's no Smokey and The Bandit and Certainly not Convoy. Yet still fun to watch.I guess I hate romantic Comedies."
5,An Essential Work For Any Lorca Fan,"In his critical 1973 expose of the events surrounding Lorca's death, Ian Gibson traces the sociopolitical climate in pre-civil war Spain through the turbulence of 1936 and the baffling last days of Federico Garcia Lorca. Based upon years of firsthand research, the book attempts to explain the conditions and possible motives that lead up to Lorca's murder and strives to make sense of a most senseless act. Through Gibson's cogent retelling of history and recreation of Lorca's character, even the most elementary of students will begin to understand how Spain's most gifted poet and playwright could become a target of the Facists and at the same time, why poetry and drama are so essential to our freedom and humanity."
5,good read for animal-loving teens,"I really loved this book a lot. I was at my grandma's after a funeral when i first was inspired to get chickens. My cousins and i were feeding the baby chicks. I then noticed the new chicken coop. The new chicks were going to be put in the new one when they got older. I wanted to know the type of chickens Uncle Greg had. Soon it became an obsession... Two days later, i swore that when we moved out i'll get chicks. That's how i found this book. I love the humor and details.It had all the same questions i was asking! I really recommend giving this great book a try!It has so much more to it than you think... now all i have to do is try to convince my mom to let me get my chosen breed: Barred Plymouth Rock. (recommended if you live in MN) 'cause of the weather. ENJOY!"
5,Great reference tool,"My very first chickens are 2 months old now, and I've referred back to this book countless times, for help with making brooder boxes, when to remove the heat lamp, buying feeders/waterers, making our coop, treating diarrhea, when to switch feeds, how to tell a cockerel from a pullet (!), to find out if panting in 90-degree weather is normal (it is), etc., etc. It may be written for kids, but it is not condescending. I appreciate the practical and have-fun approach. I just read about the different chicken sounds, and learned that the cool sound my hens make when they're happy is called ""singing."" Get the book!"
4,Great book for children,"This book is easy to read. I thought it was helpful even for the adult beginner. A great book for a child/parent project, 4-H or school raising chicks. 4 stars because I had to explain many of the words used to my child."
1,Terrible DVD,"This is without question the most disjointed, badly edited, & boring DVD I have ever seen. I was so excited to get it, as my husband & I both grew up in Indpls. during the '50's. The uninteresting commentators talked about what a great city Indpls. was, & how proud they were to be a part of it. It made me feel ashamed, & also made me wonder if I had glorified my happy childhood in Indpls., because that sure wasn't the way I remembered my life. I had planned on showing this to my daughters & my grandson, but instead, I promptly put it in the wastebasket when we finished watching it."
2,Ugly art,"This comes as a complete set of Naipe cards (Spanish style). Hard to believe these are the best cards made in Argentina, as other reviewer stated. You get what you pay for. The quality also leaves a lot to be desired, these cards will get worn out after an evening of shuffling."
3,Better than his SEAL series,"You'll either like it or not. I'm looking forward to the next one. This was far better than his SEAL series where he copied the real life work of others (from their autobiography / books) Only a couple of technical mistakes, but a page turner none the less."
2,Silent Service book,"Rating is more for the shape of the book, but paperbacks are not something I strive to get for my library. I have not read the book yet to verify if the author knows what he's talking about."
1,Almost couldn't finish this one,"Sorry all you sub/military fans, but I had a hard time picking this one up once I had started. It was sluggish and stayed that way. In the beginning we have about 2 chapters with the Russians and then they're not heard from again for about 3/4 of the book. This was supposed to be a big bang post-Cold War, and the enemy's mostly missing. The acronyms are handled poorly and there are things that get mentioned and lost again. I felt there was maybe only one chapter worth reading at all... If you're into action, don't bother."
4,Makes Great Cards,"This software is easy to use and makes great cards. With the average card being 2 to 3 dollars a piece, this package will pay for itself in only about 15 cards. I have not tried to make my our card from scratch, but there are so may premade ones in every category and type that I have not had the need to do so yet. I previously had version 2.0 and upgraded to version 3.0, but there was not much difference. The only difference is the the photo editior which comes with it. The photo editor, Instant PhotoExpert is ok, but you can not print different photos on the same page when using the reprint templates. The only thing about the Hallmark software that gets annoying is if you use standard 8.5 by 11 card stock to print a two sided card, the front picture does not automatically resize for the size paper and you end up with white space at the top and bottom of the card that goes beyond the regular unprintable area when you print it out. Overall, this product is worth the price."
1,Going backwards,"I agree with Sharidan about this product being inflexible. I bought this product after using Microsoft Greetings Workshop (1996 edition). I thought the Card Studio 3 Deluxe would expand in a good way on the older product. Unfortunately, it is less flexible (ie not set up to change backgrounds, or easily move text or make various substitutions without a lot of steps. It took the fun out of making cards for me...and isn't that the point? I will ship it back and try to find an updated edition of something closer to Greetings Workshop."
4,"Good, but looking for better",I wish you could type in a keyword and let you sort through pictures to choose from like microsoft greetings. I like it but just not quite what I expected. Looking for better programs.
2,Can't find anything,"I also have the Greetings Workshop program that came with my PC. This Hallmark version is very clunky and doesn't include a ""Find"" feature which helps locate clip art subjects you want to use. The photo editing software (included) doesn't give a tutorial AT ALL and you just have to guess your way around it.This product was a Christmas gift and I feel bad, because I'll take it off my computer and possibly buy the newer version of MSN Greetings Workshop."
2,OPTIONS TOO LIMITED,"This program offers no options for creating shaped fonts as in the older program ""Greetings Workshop"", which is a very good program. On it you can add many shadows and shapes to your fonts and make a very professional looking project. However, this new program has no options to do that. It has limited color choices and no ""search"" option to find specific pictures, as the old program did. I will buy the older program and see if I can use it on my ME system. It's made for 95 and 98. I wish I could find a new program that has the options of my older program. I AM RETURNING THIS PROGRAM."
1,Not good!,"This product sounds great when you hear what it is! But, if you have any computer smarts, you could do this on your own! If you have access to Power Point, you don't need this program! You can create your own! There is a VERY limited selection of cards and when creating labels, there are only a few choices for the different Avery label sizes. The ONLY good thing is the program already has the card and label sizes formatted for you! If I knew what this program was to begin with, I would have NEVER purchased it!"
2,Sierra products,"I found this product extremely hard to navigate and the directions, for me, were difficult. I became so discouraged that I tried to remove it and am still having trouble with that."
1,THIS PRODUCT IS THE WORST!,"This product is the worst. Changing text is a NIGHTMARE! How could Hallmark let their good name be associated with such a badly designed program. It is only Ok if you want a card exactly as formatted. We previously had an older American Greetings program that was great. My 9 year old could write birthday cards; thank you notes; etc. with no help from me. We changed or designed every card, it was easy. Now we have a new computer with XP and no adequate software options."
1,The Worst Textbook Ever to Learn Spanish!,"This is by far the worst textbook ever written for Spanish classes. Not only is it poorly written (gratuitous amounts of grammatical errors, typos, etc.) but it is OVERPRICED beyond belief. It is in all honesty worthless. Each section focuses on a type of writing and then provides sample passages, such as expository or narrative writing. I quite honestly failed to see the point of the textbook. I cannot understand how any professor in their right mind would even assign such a terrible waste of money textbook to any class."
5,...yours truly...,"One of the main reasons I give this video five stars is that this truly unique video doesn't try to exploit the idea of the diary's existance...in fact, it tends to discourage it's viability, and with the semi-plausible/almost laughable excuse for the diary's possesion, and if it weren't for the timeline, i would even suggest that the 'possesor' was also the guilty party...however, with this being impossible, we must accept the possibility that this is indeed the diary of Jack...no one knows for sure, and even by the end of many repeat viewings, i have yet to come to a conclusion myself...but one conclusion i can draw is that this is one of the most fascinating cases of a video featuring 'talking heads' actually talking...you see every point of view, you're given facts, both pro and con, and even if you are an afficienado of the ripper tales, i guarantee you will still get more insights,not to mention that slight chill up your spine...."
3,Interested in Crime and Detective Documentaries?,"A couple of years before this film was made, a purported diary of Jack the Ripper surfaced. This is the story of the attempt to prove it a hoax. The forensic science that went into the effort is detailed. What's interesting, however, is that the more they attempted to prove it a fake, the more the results proved it was probably authentic.So who was Jack the Ripper? You think I'm going to give it away???Warning: some police photos of the victims are shown, including the last one which was especially disgusting."
1,The diary was proven to be a hoax.,The so-called diary of Jack the ripper was proven to be a hoax despite what one poster said.I guess that you can fool some of the people some of the time.Avoid this DVD.
3,PROVEN Hoax--NOT!,"I have not seen this movie; but am interested in it. The Diary (though I doubt the authenticy myself) has NOT been ""PROVEN"" to be a hoax......"
2,Out of Date,"This was probably an excellent book when it was current, but I felt very uncomfortable reading it."
2,let down,"i was not pleased with the purchase of this item. of the six discs, one disc did not play. i was unable to view the entire season!"
4,Oh the sixth season,"The sixth season, filled with turmoil off camera, is the worst of all the seasons; however, the BAU team (and the cast and crew of the show) soldiers on the best they can(and kudos to them for still being good, though not great, despite the powers that be attempting to destroy everything good about the show). The best thing about this season is the music -- and I never say that about Criminial Minds. This season was easier for me to watch the second time around knowing my BAU family would be back together as they should be come season 7."
5,Criminal Minds Season 6,"We love CM in our household. Season 6 was the best in our collective opinions, so even though we don't usually buy TV series, we had to make an exception for this one, GREAT SEASON!"
5,"Not my favorite season, but still a great show",Love Criminal Minds! But this season was not my favorite due to the change in cast. I do not like the Seaver character at all. But the Emily Prentiss focused episodes were fantastic. I have all the seasons so far and I recommend this for any Criminal Minds fan's collection.
2,Criminal Minds Season 6,The series is great but not until I got to Disc 5 that it freezes up and will not play. Very upsetting as I am going to miss 4 episodes with this Disc not working!!!!!
5,Watched it twice!,This season is one of the best!! I do not normally watch an entire season of ANY show twice but I did with this season! Excellent writing and acting!!
2,Degenerating into cheap shock writing,"Just watched the second episode of Season 6. I have been a big fan of the show all through season 5 (own all the dvds) and was looking forward to this season. What a disappointment to start off with the first two episodes filled with cheap ultra violence against the defenseless to make it more ""entertaining"" but really just a way to avoid the true subtlety and suspense that good writing creates. It appears its not just some of the actors that are being let go to save money, but writing talent to. I found it very disappointing and really don't want to have to take the chance of viewing another episode 2 on the chance that they might have made a turn around."
5,Criminal Minds Great Entertainment,"I have enjoyed Criminal Minds for years and have watched episode after episode. These actors do such an excellent job portraying their characters to keep the show exciting. Wanting to see a missed episode, I turned to Amazon to fill me in for a small fee. It was well worth the $1.99 to watch this chapter without having to wait for it to come out on reruns."
2,criminal minds season 6?,Two disks had bad skips. I have bought previous seasons from Amazon and received better quality. This one was of poor quality.
5,Criminal Minds the greatest,"I am addicted that is all I can say. My daughter and I do not have a television in the house because there is so much junk on television. When I discovered that I could buy this while I was recovering from recent surgery well, I have not put my computer down since."
4,"Good looking, well built, comes apart easy (good and bad)","Like all Brio stuff, it's well made and does what it's supposed to do. You should know that the ""milk"" tank part comes off the base very easy. Like a lot of Brio cars, it has a magnet on top so you can lift off the ""cargo"" part (& put it bacl on) with one of the crane accessories.It's not necessarily a problem, but you should know it's basically two smaller parts (the ""flat car"" part and the tank part). My 2 1/2 year old doesn't have a crane, and wonders why the ""milk"" goes flying off everytime it tips over."
4,Potentially easy to loose,"Beyond the normal ""i lost my toy"" problems - this car is actually 2 separate pieces - the milk tank and the wheeled wagon bottom. They aren't attached together - there are 2 pegs the tank sits on. I keep finding the milk tank in one corner of the living room and the wheeled part somewhere else. While my son loves the thing, I am disappointed and rather confused as to why they aren't just glued together (something which I am going to do myself). Otherwise, a great toy. Sturdy, good materials, should last a long time with lots of play."
5,Great Resource,"Author Mark Levin has put together a great resource for those in charge of putting together a school newspaper. ""Kids in Print"" contains everything you'll need to ensure a successful publication."
2,Unnecessarily rude,"I didn't know this book existed until I read Frances Milstead's book on her son. This book does give insight on his disco career that John Waters' ""Shock Value"" and ""My Son Divine"" miss out on. Bernard Jay was there with Divine the entire time, and there are a lot of interesting stories. In ""My Son Divine"", Ms. Milstead brings up Mr. Jay's memoirs and denounces some of them, and it makes you doubt the stories in ""Not Simply Divine"" and makes you wonder how much is made up for dramatic effect. The worst part of the book is that Mr. Jay goes out of his way to insult Divine, by refering to how fat he is, his 'flabby' skin, and even brings up Divine farting in cars and airplanes. OK, maybe he didn't like Divine that much as a person, but how is he helping himself by being unnecessarily rude?"
2,An Attempt To Cash In On Divine's Name,"Bernard Jay states in the introduction of this book that he is not bitter. I have never read a more bitter account in my life! In my opinion he didn't make enough money from Divine while Divine was alive, so this is an attempt to squeeze more money from Divine's name.The author constantly makes catty remarks in reference to Divine's size. I realize Divine was large and that can't go unmentioned. However, is it necessary to say, ""soon after discovering his huge bulk"" (upon finding Divine dead in his bed). I find the descriptions unnecessary.The constant insults make the book less interesting. As if the author is out for revenge or something.It is an entertaining read, simply because Divine led such a twisted life as an internationally known drag queen. However this book won't win over any new fans, and may disgust the old fans."
1,Simply disrespectful,"I totally agree with some of the other reviews about this book. The way Bernard Jay talks about Divine in his book is just plain rude. OK - We know that you didn't like Divine, Mr. Jay - but is it essential for you to make personal attacks about Divine's size and bodily functions? I don't think anyone deserves to be spoken of like that - celebrity or otherwise. No one is perfect, and I'm sure Divine wasn't either. However, if you wanted to write a book about him, you could have eliminated the sophomoric attempts to belittle him. If you obtain any degree of celebrity yourself, Mr. Jay, other than dedicating your career to someone you didn't like, maybe someone will write a book about how often YOU farted. Fair?"
3,"Poor writing, bad taste.","I was a little disappointed with this memoir. I felt that the writing was somewhat erratic in tone and some passages were poorly edited. I also disappointed that there was little written about on Glenn's initial formation of the Divine character. Although Jay is attempting to clear Divine's reputation as simply a drag queen, and the fact that he was not a part of Divine's life during the early Waters years, it troubles me that there was that gap of information about Divine in the book. I honestly have no idea if the Dreamlanders refused to collaborate with Jay, but shame on him if he brushed-off their potential contribution. It would been more comprehensive and a relief from Jay's shallow narrative. I agree with the many other complaints written. I can't blame Jay for being critical of Divine's spoiled, selfish nature, but I thought a few descriptions of Divine were distasteful. Despite these faults, I did still enjoy the anecdotes of Divine's disco misadventures."
2,Hello Kitty Tin,I was very dissappointed in this tin. The one I received looks nothing like the colorful picture. It is done in grays and browns. There are tiny heads of Hello Kitty printed over the entire tin. There is no pretty pink and white large kitty head. There are no colorful strips and no colorful handle. It was too late for me to return it as I needed it for a birthday gift. Now my little granddaughter has an ugly brown/gray version of this beautiful tin.
3,Decent Mediocre Movie about Redemption,"A little slow moving, and a little long (they easily could've cut out 15 minutes). Good acting, but actors could've done more i think w/ better directing. a relatively inconsequential movie - with characters intertwining, leaving you less confused as movie progresses. not the most original type of story (i.e. redemption), but it does leave you pondering the existential points of life. good music by girl Dane Cook is having affair with.overall, 3.3 stars."
3,Interesting character study.,"This movie surprised me. There were some really great performances from people I didn't expect, namely Dane Cook. He seems to be a very diversive person in popculture and I found his performance emotional and honest. It was a sort of a slow story that was all building to the twists at the end. It felt like Crash or other movies where all of these random stories collide in dramatic ways.Some parts I sort of got bored with the pacing of the story. But there were also some really nice moments. Like when the amazing Elizabeth Mitchell buys baby clothes and stuffed animals and can't tell the check out lady she doesn't have a child. And then she has the box in her trunk full of baby clothes. That was beautiful acted and very emotional.I also thought all of the scenes with the paralyzed brother and the recovering alcoholic sister. It just felt real and raw and I like it.Good movie if you want something a bit on the dark side."
5,For witch lovers and fearers alike,"I got this book for my nephew for his 6th birthday - he loves witches. The witches are no longer by the end of this book, but not without some feeling of regret among the brave men who take them on, led by the wise rabbi. Great story, wonderful illustrations. My 5-year old daughter wants her own copy now and I agree that borrowing it periodically from the library will not suffice."
2,Didn't look the same,"When I received the pens they did not look like the ones in the picture. The picture shows that they have a silver barrel, the ones I received had the same color barrel as the grip."
2,Not what the picture shows.,I like these pens but they are not what the picture shows. They are Xtend pens but they are either older or newer than the pens pictured.
1,Didn't work for me,"I recently purchased this product for a trip to Hawaii. I have fair skin and tend to burn fairly quickly and I wanted something that I wouldn't have to re-apply every hour or so. Usually an spf 35 is more than enough if re-applied every couple of hours or so. I applied this sunblock less than an hour before heading to the beach. I swam and hung out in the sun for around two hours, no more. Later that evening I realized that I had been severely sunburned, it was as if I had had no sunblock on at all. I will never use this prouct again or any other Body Theraputics product. I would not recommend this product to anyone!"
1,No address for returns and no response from company,"Buyers Beware! I bought a gown, robe, and matching baby outfits in pink with polka dots (so cute!). I love the nursing gown. However, the robe is a different shade from gown (same color on order) and doesn't fit me well. I am attempting to return the item, but the company has no listed shipping address, and have not responded to my phone and email requests for shipping address. If you get something from this company, you better love it, because you'll be stuck with it. Some nice products, but poor business practices."
2,ok not great,the pants are great but the top is pretty shotty... my breasts constantly fall out ... just not made correctly or something. not enough support even just for aROUND THE HOUSEi use the pants w diff nursing tank top. not worth the $$$
2,This Needs a Bra,"I loved the concept of this item, but it didn't live up to my expectations. The top was extremely loose in the bra portion and provided no support. The pants, however, were comfortable and I really loved them.The top needs to be reworked."
1,"Poor quality, zero customer service","Simply put: great design, poor execution. Mine disintegrated within 6 months of normal wear and laundering. The company did not return emails or phone calls from me (and I have been very polite). I recommend saving your money and buying something of better quality from a more reputable company."
3,Nice PJs,The PJs are very comfy -- especially the bottoms! I'm not as thrilled with the top - it needs to be cut tighter at the shoulder since it doesn't fit well after you've nursed a few times and the fabric gets stretched out.
3,Para principiantes,"Leí ellibro. Me parece bueno para principiantes. Te explica como ungir una vela, qué hacer para trabajar con ellas. Los rituales son dependiendo de la preferencia religiosa de la persona. Unos rituales son como con textos bíblicos, otros más acomodados al ritual. Te dice los colores y significado al usar las velas. Explica un poco de magia negra y hace la salvedad de lo peligrosa que puede ser. Tienen rituales para cada situación. Se lee rápido. Fácil de entender.Adquiera uno."
2,"Confuso el libro, dificil de entender","Para el q cree, bien. Ni lo recomiendo ni lo dejo de recomendar. Mi opinion es neutral. Solo que debiera explicar mas sencillamente todo el relajo con las posiciones de las velas. La verdad lo compre para aprender e informarme pero pienso que todo eso es puro disparate.Gracias"
4,get the latest version,"As the title states, got version 9 one week before release of 10, would have waited one week if knew new version was coming. Given download after mildly laborious process, instead of boxed version. Reply to sent mail took a while but I'm betting there were many lunks trapped in my situation. For this reason I downgraded an excellent to a good but could have been better rating of 4 stars."
1,The Dictionary of Nautical Literacy,"Stating this is a Nautical Dictionary is a great miss direction. I believe a nautical dictionary is to be as complete as possible listing of nautical terms. That is what I thought the foundation of the book would be. Having failed on that part, I question other information contain in this book.A good test for this book is to get any boating magazine. Highlight the nautical terms, than see how few are addressed in the book."
1,IT REALLY (...),This game (...)all it wants to do is when you scan a barcode then once you go on your computer they now what you bought and they use your name to buy stuff off the internet. Trust me this is not a game!!!!!!!!!!!! It's true! Belive me i have it and know it. I didn't know about it till my dad told me! When i went to my mailbox i didn't order a DVD player it just came to my house because of the game!!!!!!!!!!!
2,"Hope It's Not Like ""DNA Factor"" For GBA","I truly hope that it's not like the new Gameboy Advance game called JP3:DNA Factor. From what I hear they didn't take there time making that game, so it's not really that good."
1,poor,not so good i did not get the scanner which i was hoping was coming with... next time you should let ppl know that there isnt one that comes with it
2,Disillusioned,"I recently purchased Scan Command and found it to be quite confusing to both play and download. The instructions are limited at best and don't go into detail. I was frustrated at how difficult it is to ""prepare"" the scanner, just to get ready to play the game, which I never got to do."
4,Scanner,"As much as my son and I enjoyed the graphics and game play the scanner idea was flawed. Scanning Barcodes are not nessary with the scanner. We found that running the scanner accross the computer screen was just as helpfull has trying to scan barcodes. The game is good if you have the time to mess with the scanner and getting the ""codes"" into it."
5,Way COOL TOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This toy is awsome i got my t-rex has won about 1,000,000 battles. I found a barcode that will drive you guys crazy go to the Acme and buy a cake you will get so many points!!!!!"
5,One major flaw hoax: READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!,"I bought Jurassic Park Scan Command, and I am having a blast with it. Just a few minutes ago, I read a review for this game that said there was a major flaw in the game, because you couldn't reset the scanner and be able to scan barcodes that was scanned before. WRONG! There is a way. If the reviewer would have taken the time to read the instructions carefully, if not at all, they would know that there is a reset button on the back of the scanner. It is made for reseting the scanner after it has frozen, but if you press it (you have to use a pencil point to press it), it will reset the barcode history, and you can scan barcodes again and again. This is why you READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!"
5,Gotta hear this and gotta see them,"Listening to this CD makes you realize how many great artists there are out there that you have never heard of. I'm lucky enough to live in Austin and so I have the chance to see these guys live. They put on a great live show. The CD comes with a DVD that has some of that energy. The CD is great too. A lot of the energy of the live music is captured on the disc. The Del Castillo brothers are not only technically great guitarists, they have wonderful chemistry. Buy the CD and if Del Castillo comes to your neighborhood, go see them play."
4,It Does The Job,"The Royal Extreme Organizer does the job... Adresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses are at your finger tips in the ""Phone"" section. Basic appointments appear in the ""Scheduler"" section along with the mandatory ""To-Do"" list.Believe it or not, this little organizer comes with ""Soft-Sync"" software that allows sychronization of the organizer with PDA software on your desktop, and it's included in the price.On the down side, the screen is small and the included games are lame.."
3,Royal PDA coolest ever,"The Royal Extreme 192kb memory touch screen organizer is the best ever for people who want a small portable calendar. It fits in your pocket, and it is cool to use a touch screen. I hope you buy this Extreme PDA."
4,Loved it but still only 4 stars,"The reason keeping it from 5 stars is that the track list on the back does not match the actual songs. The real order is in the Albums sleeve though so you can fix it when you get it.Correct order of the songs is The order listed on the ""On this CD"" section of this page. Check to make sure you are listening to the correct song before sampling"
4,odd,"this cd is odd, i must say. I wouldnt have expected anyone to do a tribute to a new band like this. Nothing against sum 41, but lets face it, their songs arent that unique or moving in any way. they arent pioneers of their genre or of anything really. they werent deserving of a string quartet tribute.thats just my opinoin.otherwise this is an all right cd.they did a nice job.by the way...that other reviewer is right.the samples are a bit screwed up.as far as i know, the ""still waiting"" sample sounds a lot like ""summer"" to me."
2,FELL OFF,"now before you hate because of my rating,i LOVE bustas older material. when he was with the leaders he was lyrically top 20. but now, hes doing songs with sucker emcees and trying to crossover with a girl band. the only thing that keeps me from giving this one star is j-dilla's presence. he was one of the greats and busta is lucky the god dilla even laced him with beats."
5,Bus-A-Bus Baby,"Busta Rhymes returns to form with this CD. The good doctor (Dr. Dre) helped Busta Rhymers re-reach the acclaim of his first records. Quite an astonishing listen.The CD features a number of well respected artists and plenty of great tracks. The first track Get You Some is a nice intro to the album. Touch It, the first single and second track, is quite excellent just as well.How We Do It Over Here featuring Missy Elliot is an amazing track also.The real highlghts are the back to back hits Been Through the Storm and In the Ghetto featuring two heroes in their time, Stevie Wonder and Rick James, respectively.After the somewhat lackluster Cocaina, the CD is nearly flawless. although You Can't Hold the Torch is wonderful, the succeeding song Goldmine may well be the highlight of the second half of the album.Busta's return to form.Highly recommended."
1,"And to think, he used to be good...","I liked his earlier CDs to a degree. He had a lot of good songs, and even some classics on his first couple of CDs. Now he makes this kind of stuff? I mean come on. This is even worse than his last CD. I got to say that there are no good songs on this. Stay away from this and get one of his earlier CDs. You won't regret that."
2,the big lemon...,"yup...as i suspected and wrote here before the album's release: it's a bust. it is not as exuberant as i thot it was going to be judging by the awesome first single and the remixes. when i heard second single (i love my...), i was sure this was going to be a mixed affair. not that bus has made exceptional albums before but at least they seemed a bit more fun. granted i've only listened once...maybe it will grow on me. biggest disappointments tho:1. ""i love my chick""2. the remixes of ""touch it"" were not included after watching the video for the past few months"
5,Classic Busta Rhymes,im a big fan of hip/hop the underground & the mainstream & busta is one of my favorite east coast MC's but some of his previous releases were not that great but THE BIG BANG is a classic DR. DRE & BUSTA RHYMES are a good combination amazing beats plus great lyrics by BUSTA RHYMES this is a must have album & probably one of the best of 06 my favorite track is DONT GET CARRIED AWAY NaS and Busta both come hard on that track plus a DRE beat need i say more? CLASSIC!
2,2.5 In My Veiw,"Busta Lost his touch because the money started rollin' in.Too commercial.Only good songs are ""Been Through The Storm"",and the one with Q-Tip.""cocaina"" is horrible .This ain't busta at his best.He should just retire or re-release this album with a set of new tracks that were left off like ""I'll Hurt You"" and ""Ping""."
2,Busta should've done better...,"As a big Papoose fan, I really appreciated when Busta started promoting Pap and released the Touch It remix pt. 3, Psycho Psycho, and Get Right with him. I was really looking forward to the Big Bang, but I was disappointed. I'm not crazy about the beats, and lyrically he's not coming with anything new, creative, remarkable, or thought-provoking. I was surprised because on the tracks I heard with Pap, Busta's lyrical performance was really solid. He doesn't really talk about any personal issues or experience really and it lends a soul-less or remote quality to his lyrics.This CD will go down in hip-hop history not as a classic or even a solid effort but as a disappointment because Busta could have done so much better."
4,Very Good,"This album represents a merging of styles for Busta Rhymes, and unfortunately, the last great album he has released. His tracks have a new sound, yet he still retains a good deal of his classic style, resulting in wins all around. ""Been Through the Storm"" and ""Legend of the Fall-Offs"" are just pure lyrical masterpieces (well, for a mainstream artist) and ""Get Down"" is irresistibly infectious."
3,"""The Big Bang"" aka ""THE BIG BLUFF""","Busta Rhymes droped his most highly anticipated album in years on June 13 titled ""The Big Bang."" With all the commercials and singles and advertisments i was expecting this to blow my socks off but after listening to the album i was very dissapointed, as was his record label as this MEGA ALBUM only went on to sell 209,000 the first week not even half of what TI accomplished or even the High School Musical soundtrack sung by a bunch of children...The albums production is its only semi bright spot as 2/3 of the album showcases quality produced songs...The main problem i have with The Big Bang is the overuse of unesessary profanity throughout nearly every song in the album...And the non range of topics Busta speaks about...The album is barely even worth downloading in my opinion as i wouldn't even listen to it twice..."
2,only cuz it's Busta,"Busta's best album to date has to be ELE hands down. The last Busta album I have of his is Anarchy and that was just good not great. It kind of signaled a sign of the times for him. Genesis and It ain't safe no more didn't do anything for me because the singles he realeased weren't anything special. I don't know why Busta chooses to releases the more pointless songs on his albums as singles. On most of them he's just cursing for the hell of it or talking about the same sill topics women, violence, I'm a badman, etc. Busta doesn't reach any level of consciousness.The only good thing I can say about this album is that Dr. Dre did some beats, he did some work with NAS who, to me, is the best hip hop MC (not just your average rapper)around, and he brought Q-TIP back into the Limelight. With that said, Busta seems to have lost more than his dreadlocks with this album."
1,BUSTED BUSTA ...,"Yet another rehashing of formula rap from this egomaniac.. boring... It would have at least shown some good taste, with a tribute to the poor body guard who was innocently gunned down at Busta's video shoot. BUSTA'S NEXT RELEASE SHOULD BE WITH THE NYC POLICE ON WHAT REALLY HAPPENED AND WHY HE PUNKED OUT WITH A SUDDEN CASE OF AMNESIA .."
4,A Definite Buy,"I was expecting big things from this album and what I found was something different, not better, not worse, just different. The beats are good with a mix of some dance tracks, a little African drums, and do I detect some Asian influences as well? What's better is the music is accompanied with decent lyrics. There is a little something of everything on this CD and everyone too. Who would expect an album to have both Rick James and Stevie Wonder? This album is a definite buy for any Busta fan and for anyone whom is looking for a little something different based in a little similarity."
2,The Big Bang is almost a Big Blow.,"The Big Bang ** StarsThis cd is a dissappointment from busta who's made some good things, he cannot save NY on this one, Although there are some good songs on there like the one from rick james is good, but that I Love that bitch is just horrible (I Don't why he picked that single) and the rest are just dissappointment.Although it's not as bad as other releases this year, but I'm gonna give this one a Thumbs down, I Really didn't care for this cd.Busta's a very funny and good rapper, But I Can't recommend this album."
4,The Big Bang,"Dope album from Busta, its actually one of his best albums. You have the club banger ""Touch It"" which always gets the party started as well as ""How We Do It Over Here"" then on ""NY S***"" Busta tells you how hes on his NY s*** and big ups everybody in the Big Apple. You got plenty of street joints on here like ""Goldmine"" , ""Cocaina"" & Don't Get Carried Away"" . The album is perfect til it gets to track 12, the last four songs should of been axed from the album. All in all its a dope album from Busta. 4/5. Fun fact : Where's Your Money (Feat ODB) & Rough Around The Edges (feat Nas) was originally supposed to be on this album but for some reason they were left off. Classic songs worth checking out"
2,who takes this serious,I respect busta as being a good rapper but here he takes himself too serious busta used to be funny as hell and outrageous now he's on steroids and possibly crack now he's telling everybody he's a gangbanger and claiming he sold dope in high school with biggie and jay z please we know busta's bisexual anyway still he tries to bring new york back making vkideos acknowkledging old school rap legends please qwe know hip hop started in ny. busta save your checks this is your last stand we barely see him pop up on remixes these days.
5,please wake up and listen,this is a great album the tracks are bangers and the lyrics are on point if you don't believe this is the ish you really don't listen. The man has grown and the songs are hard hitting man listen again. The song with Q-tip is my fav and the ghetto even he rocks with stevie wonder on the hook besides the missy song the album is a classic in my book.
1,POP,like one real hard song the rest is bubble gum......the reason why New york is dying fast. NAS SAVE THEM PLEASE
5,CLASSIC!,"Name a Hiphop album POST-2000, that's more consistent with better production track for track than this one. Busta is not only saving the eastcoast, hes RUNNING the eastcoast right now. DONT LISTEN to tony and james (prolly the same person). HE just a hater who's mad cause busta aint give him a autograph at one of his CONCERTS. 2006 hiphop CLASSIC. BUY IT NOW."
5,If your gonna write and review know what your talking about.,"Busta Rhymes has been around for a while now and is a legend in his own right. To compare him to 50 Cent is an insult to him. He has always been on another level lyricly than almost everyone in the game except for mabey a few people. Busta's beats have alway been out of control. I'm not sure how i feel about this album yet but I can tell I think the whole ""touch it"" song/remixes is crap but I also understand that he needed a club hit and something to draw in people that normaly wouldn't buy his album. Busta is the man and i would definatly recomend this album. If your buying this album because you like 50 cent and you think he's cool now that he's on aftermath but not before.... Don't bother."
2,a bust,"Ya know, I thought this be a summer when Busta and Ice Cube would both drop the usual hottness and put losers like Paul Wall in their place. Cube's album is great, but Busta's latest effort disappointed me.I know it's 2006 and club-hoppin' is more popular than ever, but Busta got too carried away with that theme. Busta's always had several catchy songs on all of his albums, but there's too much ""baby baby drop it like it's hott"" music this time. Sure, there's a handful of hardcore and offbeat tracks that deliver a message, but I'm better off just downloading those rather than paying for this whole album.If this was a Yung Joc album, I'd give it 3 stars and say ""good effort, [...]"". But Busta is the king of offbeat modern rap, and I expect so much from every release. I was expecting something like ""When Disaster Strikes"" with all those mind-bending beats and lyrics. Maybe next time."
4,pretty dope,"This is a very good release from the dungeon dragon. Busta displays great word play, very nice production, and some infectious hooks. Busta does have some really commercial material on the album like I love my b#tch, but the other material that is on the album outshines the commercial stuff. If you know anything about busta's music you will appreciate this release. Also if you are an old school head pick up KRS ONE's new album Life. Its even hotter than Busta's album!"
2,Pick something else,"Don't believe the hype. The CD is not all that, you can easily not miss it. Spend your change on Ice Cube's latest instead."
5,lab book,"I continue to find this reference handbook useful, and prefer to have it available for ready consultation in most medical office practice settings."
3,ok,nice Lab test book procedure tell you what must be done and how the procedure must be need to update it cool
5,Quality thy name Steiner,These are very good binoculars. Steiner put in the best quality optics in a very good body. The 8x30 size makes it perfect combination of power and weight. First I bought steiner 10x26 but they lacked clarity as they use roof prism that too without PC. Also 10x made it very shaky in hands. It was painful and straining to watch through them for more than couple of minutes. I returned it and got these ones. These are very clear and cool!I am happy with this product.
2,Celestron 102slt,Celestron NexStar 102 SLT Computerized TelescopeScope OKFinderscope-poor qualityplastic battery compartment unusable-will not stay shutTripod very unstableI would reccomend saving your money for higher quality scope.Shipping by amazon-excellent
2,No BATTERY included for telescope,Bought this telescope for my son in December. He's not really interest. Could not return it because past 14 days.
3,First time scope,"I have not yet purchased this scope but intend to receive it as a xmas gift. My local ""popular wholesale co."" in Atlanta is selling this item for 199.99 Which is literally hundreds less than what I have seen ANYWHERE online. So for my first telescope for the price I dont believe I can go wrong. I do plan on getting a more powerful scope if I use the one listed to a degree which will further me in such an interesting hobby. I just dont understand how unreasonable the mark up online for the scope when it is sold for so cheap at this warehouse co. in comparison. So chances are when if I upgrade it will be used due to the inflation of the msrp seen on these popular sights."
2,It doesn't fit,"Sunshade does not fit around the rear view mirror and has to be squashed in order to get it around the mirror. Also, does not roll up easily or nicely. Poor design for MINI windshield. I'm returning it to the seller and will buy the factory MINI sunshade."
2,Not the best product,Doesn't fit very well on my Mini. Not the most high quality item - I should have gotten a MINI-brand shade instead and just paid extra.
4,Why so expensive?,"How does a book published only a few years ago, and so widely admired, become scarce enough to have its price jacked up up to the ceiling? And why no paperback?"
3,"Sturdy, but not ergonomic","This thing is super tough, holds a lot of stuff, and I like the 3-sided locking method.However, the handle and wheel arrangement are not conducive to dragging this thing long distances when it's fully loaded. Because of the layout, you end up lifting and holding the weight of the loaded suitcase while you're wheeling it. Not fun. And if you're tall, you're double hosed. If I stand straight up and try to wheel it, it flips up on its end. Lame.I'm fairly happy with it, but I'm currently looking for something easier to drag around. Maybe I'm just getting old."
2,arrived broken,"The size is appropriate for international travel.However the locks are poorly made, and one of thembroke while the product was being shipped to me."
2,LATCHES DONT LAST!!!,"I have had 2 or 3 of this model.Its always the same : the case is VERY durable. will last years BUT:The latches break quickly, making the item virtually worthless. { unless you buy after market straps to close it - which are annoying and dont feel secure for air flight }I WOULD pay 15.00 more for good latches!"
3,"29"" Oyster Suitcase",I love the suitcase and traveled to and from Africa with it. The combination lock was broken from the beginning but Samsonite is sending me a new lock under warranty.
4,Nice product but color was not what I expected,"The luggage itself was well made and sturdy, but the color of the luggage wasn't what I expected. The picture here makes the luggage look as if the color is more of a neon or flourescent green, however the color is very much just a lime green (the exact color of a lime you would buy at the grocery store). Other than that, I liked the product, price, and the seller very much!"
4,Good product,"Very pleased with the quick shipping and the product itself. Good product, good price! Thank you very much."
1,The Once Great Oyster Now a Shell of Its Former Self,"I purchase a new Oyster to replace the Oyster I bought ten years ago. What a disappointment: take it froma road warrior--this was once a great suitcase; no more. I just bought a new one: it does not have the suit hanger inside. The once best suit case on the market: kept your clothes dry at Philly when it rained for hours with your bag sitting on the tarmac; no ironing at your destination; easy to handle; super durable. Now, the suit hanger is gone, the new Oysters do not have a suit hanger so one half of the suit case is useless--empty space. I am sending mine back: Warning: if you are buying a new Oyster thinking that you are going to get that great great suitcase of old--you aren't. Don't bother. It's sad really. So so sad."
2,Can't lock it,"You can't lock it with a TSA approved lock. So you have to either leave it unlocked or put a cable around it & lock the cable.The clips on the sides also have a tendency to pop open.One more thing, the empty suitcase is quite heavy."
2,Samsonite quality down,"I was disappointed with this product. First, there was no notification that the divider for suits that was a normal feature until now has been dropped so the buyer does not reaize that he is buying something different. Second, one of the side locks is defective -- it does not snap closed and requires the key lock to securely lock it."
2,Bad lock design,"I have an old Oyster and ordered this new type. This bag has two latches on each side that lock with a key, first time I flew with it one of the latches opened an broken. So I'm left with a broken suitcase that I have used once. Bad design they should've kept the old manual locking latch, the material doesn't feel as sturdy."
3,Get the newer CD,"This CD is good, but it is not really well mixed and does not reflect how good this band actually is. When the 2nd CD is available get it, it is MUCH better and actually shows the skill and performance ability of these guys. If you can see them live, do it. If you want a taste try this CD, but, like I said, they have better stuff than this.If you want to know what they sound like I would say Maroon 5 meets Breaking Benjamin. They have a myspace too, Tenet."
1,Not the Real Shampoo!!!!,"Can't believe this! I bought this shampoo online this time (I usually buy it from my hair stylist's salon) and it's not the real thing - it is Purology shampoo mixed with water!!! I've been using this product for years and I know very well what it's texture is. It IS NOT LIQUID as the one I just got! Purology Pure Volume is a great shampoo, one of the best on the market. Just don't buy it from LUSH ESSENCE! Save your money - spend some more but buy the real one!"
5,"Couldn't be happier, honestly.","With fine, straight hair and a lifetime of never being able to go a day without washing my hair, I have finally found a product that works for me. I have to use more conditioner than I ever thought I should use, and I have to leave the conditioner in longer than normal. But for me, it's worth it. I came into work the other day without having washed my hair that morning. A first. I'm now a devoted customer."
4,Great Product!,"I used Pureology a few years ago and always loved it, but I started to buy less expensive shampoo since $20+ sounded like too much money for a hair product. Then I realized that I spend hundreds every year on cutting and coloring my hair, so I may as well pay money to maintain my hair."
3,Smells great,"I have extremely fine, straight hair and get highlights a few times a year. My hairstylist gave me some samples of this shampoo and conditioner to try. When I tried the samples, I thought it was helping with both the color fading and volume. But since using this shampoo on an almost daily use, I really haven't noticed an increase in volume. I'm sure it's just my hair because very few products seem to help me with volume. This shampoo smells great and my hair does feel clean after I use it, but I really need help with volume. When I finish with this bottle, I'm unsure if I'll re-order or not."
4,Manageable Hair,"I read the reviews before buying this product and what they say about a little shampoo going a long way is true! It leaves my hair manageable and along with Neutrogena deep conditioner, in fabulous shape! I understand the founder of this company sold it and has a new line of products called ""Colour"". I want to try that as well."
1,Expired,"The shampoo I received was clearly extrememly old and should not have been sold. Very disppointed with the product, as I have used it many times and this bottle was obviously unsatisfactory. I will not buy from here again."
1,Also disappionted !,"I tried this with the conditioner after reading tons of reveiws, I gave it three tries! Some reveiws said use very little, so I tried a few times, what I got was tons of static & dry unmanagable hair! Worst hair day ever! I did buy it at a local salon & thank goodness I could return it. I do however love the leave in repair conditioner by Pureolgy!"
1,Not what I thought it would be.....,"After spending a lot of money on the Pureology Volume Shampoo and Conditioner, I can say that I am extremely disappointed.After using these products, my hair is dull, heavy and feels greasy.I had been using the Graham Webb HALO products and should have stuck with them. I realize now that they are the best for my colored hair.Pureology is way over-rated. Definitely not worth the money.Never again."
5,Best Volumizing Shampoo!,I have tried many products - and this is definitely the best volumizing shampoo for color treated hair!
1,Leaked Everywhere,Very disappointed. I received my shampoo and it leaked everywhere. A third of the product was gone. I wrote a comment regarding packaging and haven't heard a thing back.
1,A stinker,"When I first read about this, I thought, volume AND moisture - perfect. And I love their colour care condition - smells minty and light and wonderful - but this stuff smells absolutely horrible. I almost gagged every time I tried to use it. Plus it made my hair icky feeling and looking the very next morning. Wish I could send it back because it is expensive to just be thrown away."
2,Slightly better than Paul Mitchell Volume Shampoo,"I switched to Pureology Pure Volume Shampoo after trying the Paul Mitchell brand and thinking that a moisturizing brand would be better. PM's shampoo left my hair dry and brittle. Pureology shampoo was instantly better at first. Then about 2 weeks later I noticed my hair was dry and decided to add the conditioner as well. The pair promised to ensure the moisturizing part. No dice. My hair is dull and scraggly (I can't think of a better description). I tried leaving it naturally curly and putting in leave-in conditioner and then back to flat-ironing. No difference. It's this product. I think unfortunately there is no magic bullet for flatter hair besides blow drying and teasing. Oh well. I'd rather have shiny healthy flat hair, than bad-looking ""volume."""
2,Not so quiet and only lasted 6 months,"On the good side, it was a little quieter than the basic power supply my HP computer came with, but not as quiet as I was hoping for, especially for triple the price of a basic one.Also its cooling fan died after 6 months of use, making it basically useless, even though it continued to supply power to the computer. I found its fan failed when my computer overheated and I looked inside and saw it wasn't spinning."
4,This is what it must have been like,"I was given a beat-up Avon paperback from 1963 and became thoroughly engrossed. Often repetitive but never dull, this day-by-day account by a Seaman First Class of three years of action on a light cruiser in the Pacific afforded me a new appreciation of what my father endured in the same places at the same time. Highly recommended to any American."
4,"Pacific War Diary, 1942-1945",What a GREAT read! It gives an amazing appreciation for what those folks went through. Highly recommended.
3,Stuck In the 20th Century,"Overall, a good book but needs to be updated to include considerations and suggestions for digital photography and the internet. As currently written, it is exclusively oriented towards the world of film photography and mailing hard copy prints or 35 mm slides. That detracts from the value of the book."
5,flush,i kin flush the terlit in my trailer now witout havin to get my sister to help. bobby sue is a mite peed off but but this was a great replacement handle fer me.
5,Valves,"theses are good valves, the only thing is they are hard to install not anything to do with the valves it is all in design, the rv companies want you to take it to a dealer so they can make money. All in all the valves are great and very good price."
5,AWESOMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE,"THIS IS THE BEST SELLING GAME WITH 40 MILLION COPIES AS OF 1999 AND THE BEST GAME OF THE 80S, 90S, 2000S. IT IS AAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWSSSOMMMMEEECASE CLOSED. BOWSER LOST TO MARIO."
2,Worst version of the game cause its the original.,Yeah yeah yeah retro gamers will rejoice and blah blah blah but Super Mario Bros Deluxe was way better because it was a game I could beat cause I could save.Hell I think the Super Mario Bros/Duck Hunt cartridge was better because on that you could at least continue.
4,Just like old times...,"I played the NES since I was 2 or 3(1994). My favorite game was always SMB 3. But I had SMB 1 also. I can't play my NES because a newer TV. This game is a real die-hard classic. Here is my pros and cons listPROS:-Just like the original. Nothing is missing! Everything is there!-Maps are as aurate as they can be. This is an exact reolica!-The infamous Minus World glitch is there too.-And so is the ""Hold the A button and press start"" trick!-Connectivity with single pak and multi pak!-Wirless connectivity-Nothing new!Cons-If you have an unofficial connection wire you can't do single pakAs I mentioned earlier it has wireless connectivity. Don't go rushing out for a wirless adapter because it's not made yet. It won't come out 'til September. I hope my reveiw helped!"
3,Challenging but fun.Id give it B +,This has to be the most challenging version of this game.I cant remember if the original Super Mario Bros had 1 ups in it but I think it did.Ive played to the 6th level in this game and havent run into a 1 up mushroom once and I also think you had a continue option in the original.Maybe this is the real original because I think the version I had which was Super Mario Bros./Duck Hunt had a few improvements such as the continue and the debut of the one up mushroom.This game was never my favorite Mario game I never even really liked Mario all that much until the 3d one but I have to admit after all these years it is still a hard game which is a tad awkward to control.The Game Boy Color version had slightly better graphics and a save option but youll play this one more.Trust me its addictive.
5,Fianly !!!!!!!!,"Yes!!!! I'm 9 years old,so I was not able to expirience the origanal Mario Bros. I have Super Mario Bros. 2 and Super Mario Bros. 3. They each come with with Mario Bros, but this is the actually the original Classic NES game of it. Not the ""New and improved"" version of the game. I'm getting this tomorow definitly! (6/13/04. My thought is that this is going tobe absolutely GREAt!!!!! You should definitly get this game I can Hardly wait!!!!"
4,Remember the 80's,"Honestly I bougth this game for my son, who is 4 years old.However, when I was a teen, I had played in the nes console."
3,I'm confused!,"This game is kind of fun, but was it the first Mario video game or was Donkey Kong the first Mario video game because I was just asking."
1,Your'e Getting Ripped Off,"For roughly the same price, you could get Super Mario Bros. Deluxe, it plays on all Game Boy systems, and has everythign this game has plus a lot more. Does this game have Super Mario Bros. 2 hidden in it? No. Does it have a calendar? No. Mini games? No. You're much better off with Mario Bros. Deluxe."
3,Decent,I had been anticipating this movie for awhile now and was thinking that it would follow the story as close as the first Gantz live action movie but to my dismay it barely follows the real story at all. If you read the manga I would just recommend that you should view this movie as an alternate storyline/ending to the original manga story because of course they had to shorten it since the manga isn't even finished. The action isn't as awesome and there is a lot of dialog compared to the first movie but I'd still recommend watching this due to the fact that it is Gantz(which is awesome as long as your a fan). The ending is a bit disapointing but the sword fights make it worth it!
4,Err....,"This definitely makes for a happier ending than the original Gantz, but I still enjoyed it in its own entertaining way."
4,Pleased,I really like this toe ring. It is the width I've been looking for and I love the celtic pattern. My only con would be that it is a little easier to manipulate than I prefer. I wear it everyday and so far it has retained it's shape. So it's all good.
3,Too big!,"Its made with beautiful moonstones, although some are more translucent than others. And its stretchable, but its soo big that you'd never need to stretch it out. It won't fit on a wrist of regular width."
3,Unknown...,"Not really a review on the book, but one on Amazon and a WARNING for any future buyers of this book. If that is, Amazon does not censor their customer reviews and decides to leave this on the site.If you really want this besure to know in advance that you will have to wait and wait and wait. Do not believe their ""usually ships...."" because obvously that was made on horribly wrong information.I placed my order for this book, with the site saying ""usually ships 3-4 weeks"". That was on May 24, 2005 and it is now August 11, 2005. And I just got my 3rd delay, 2nd one that I have to authorize because they know how horrible their service is."
2,Sorry it is broken,"It was very pretty, but not sturdy. It broke after the first trifle.The rim of the bowl was too delicate for real use."
1,So salty that it's unconsumable,"It arrived very quickly. No problems with the seller. However this product disappointed me. It is extremely salty. I had to throw out everything. Reese is a good brand, but I would not recommend the anchovy paste to anyone."
3,It's missing something,"I read Tyler's second book first, which is why I purchased this this book. I expected to find the same humor; however, ""Descanso"" is missing the dry wit and tension filled plot that ""Finding Polaris"" has.""Descanso"" follows Chris Cameron through her life as a psychotherapist - and boy does she have some crazy patients - after the death of her partner in a tragic accident. Chris can't seem to move on with her life alone. She meets Linda, a cop, and the two start spending some quality time with one another. While something happens to throw a wrench in their relationship, it lacks the same intensness of ""Polaris.""The sum of this novel can be found tucked inside ""Finding Polaris."" ""Descanso"" reads more like a first draft while Tyler was getting her feet wet with the story she eventually wanted to tell about Chris Cameron.Read ""Finding Polaris."""
1,"COMPASS IS JUNK-TOTAL RIP OFF, WASTE OF $","The large, bobbling ball is a waste of money. Doesn't know North from East or any other direction. You better know your way around when using this guessing-game, as it may point the right direction and may not. Sitting on my desk, it can't even find North. After fooling around with it and getting it started on the right track, when turning, it still loses track of which was is North. A $2 compass with a suction cup is a better bet than this silly thing. WASTE OF MONEY!"
3,Defend and Betray,"General Carlyon is murdered, his wife quickly takes responsibility for it. Hester, a friend of the family believes she may not have been the murderer.Nice to be back with Hester and Monk. Her friendship with Oliver Rathbone grows, Monk's memory starts to improve. The murder mystery angle is satisfying if not especially surprising. Perry writes an excellent murder trial towards the end of the book. Elsewhere though, her writing feels a bit untidy. In particular her descriptions of what the characters look like are very repetitive. It seems everyone in the Carlyon family has an aquiline nose. It makes me wonder if anyone checked the manuscript before it headed for the presses. Perry again writes well about the constraints of Society and the dilemma that General Carlyon's wife finds herself in is effectively put across.Not the best Anne Perry I've read but an enjoyable read, its lack of polish is frustrating."
4,takes a while to get going but WOW is it worth the wait,"This novel takes a bit of time to build up steam, but the final pages are worth the wait. What a climax! beautifully written and very worth while."
3,"Setting takes precedence over plot, characters","This book seemed to go on and on long after any intelligent reader would have figured out the reason why Alexandra murdered her husband. The author, having set up several protagonists and unwilling to concentrate on one of them, seems to regard the time period of Victorian England, its social interactions and mores, as more important than fleshing out the characters or moving the plot along. Monk's investigations into his past, dropped in at inappropriate intervals, made me want to shout, ""Enough, already."""
2,Should not be your first boat.,"Looks like Chinese manufacturer doesn't have anything in the factory except plastic. So, you get plastic boat only. No pump, no oars whatsoever. If you are not familiar in such boats (and it's easily possible that you aren't)- you won't be able to configure the boat with just some air pump. The biggest section uses different valve size than others 5 sections. That said, if don't know the size of it- you are out of luck.A good air pump for this boat plus a pair of oars will cost you more than you'll pay for this boat. Does this bargain then make any sense?"
5,Gateway to Learning HUGE Words,"I recently got this book at my elementary school's book fair, and I was sucked into it immediately. I love to learn big words and impress my peers. I also adore writing, and now that I have this book, I can use the vocabulary in my stories. My dream is to be in the Scripp's National Spelling Bee, and these are the type of words given to contestants. I reccomend this book to anyone who had a love for reading and most of all, spelling to impress!"
1,Fit for a fourth grader,"This book is an absolute embarrassment. Anybody reading beyond the high school level will find it totally valueless. These would be great vocabulary words for children in grade school.I bought this book expecting interesting words like pellucid or philology (thanks Simon Winchester), brobdingnagian or perspicacity. Instead, I was chagrined to find a banal collection of everyday language, including:capricious, carte blanche, heresy, malaise, mantra, nirvana, red herring, suave, tirade...AHD editors, I expected better!"
3,Fun to Flip through,This is cute book that is fun to flip through and keep with your dictionary. It is essentially just a small dictionary and beyond definitions doesn't go into detail on entomology.
5,BRILLIANT,I love this. I try to read it every day and learn new words. It has a lot of good words that people should know and that definitely make you sound smarter. I think enriching your vocabulary is so important. Everyone should own this book! It not only tells what each word means and how it's pronounced but also includes a brief history and example. Brilliant!
2,Not for those with an advanced vocabulary.,"I picked up ""100 Words"" at the Urban Outfitters, and I only needed 10 minutes to realize that the book is not meant to vastly increase an above-average vocabulary. This book is only useful to those possessing a sub par vocabulary. The words presented are easily defined, and most are not worth using in a sentence."
2,save your money,"I bought this because I wanted to expand my vocabulary, so you could imagine my disappointment when I got this book and already knew most of the words in it. Save your money."
3,Nothing fancy,"It is what it is; a book with less frequently used words, usage, pronunciation and examples. If you have one of those words of the day calendars, use that. Otherwise, it's a good small book you can carry with you and use to increase your vocabulary. However, please be sure to study the word usage reference. There is nothing worse than big words incorrectly used."
3,its an ok book,this book was in perfect condition no complaints about the shipping or distributer the only problem i had was i knew almost all of the words in this book so it was no help to me. But my overall experience with the distributer was great. I look foward to doing business with them in the future.
4,Don't We All Want to Sound Smart?,"I am a zealous (word #100) reader, so I already have a fairly advanced vocabulary and I did not find any new words here to use. But it is always a good thing to refresh one's understanding of those like byzantine, Catch-22, kitsch, and Svengali if for no other reason than to dust off old friends and start using them again. This book, however, does offer more. First, it employs some superb quotes to illustrate the correct meaning of the words in context. Second, in some cases it gives the background of the term you are using (e.g., Machiavellian, quintessential, or white elephant) so that it takes on a richer character, which makes it easier to recall and to apply in more nuanced ways. For the advanced student, I would recommend the ""mispronounces"" book in this series--after all, you can't sound smart without saying your words correctly and the vocabulary level is more challenging."
5,100 words to make you sound smart,"I bought the book because my daughter's teacher was giving them words out of the book, however, I am a secretary and I was familiar with all the words in the book except for a couple. From what my daughter told me I thought that I would be able to learn new words from the book. Her teacher must have been using other books in addition to this one. Not quite what I expected but I would still give it a good review and it came very quickly and was as described."
4,Short and Sweet,"I sometimes assign Mason's light biography of Elvis in my southern history classes, and it is always a favorite of my students.Those looking for serious scholarship will be disappointed in the book. But it is a fun book that my students actually enjoy reading and provides a great foundation for a serious discussion of youth culture, race, and class relations. And, of course, it also shows students, who are only familiar with the kitsch, why Elvis mattered to so many people."
5,An insightful view of Elvis,"I've read Last Train to Memphis, Careless Love and other biographies of Elvis, but this is the first one to treat him so 'humanly', explaining his background and how it affected his actions as a person. I really enjoyed it; I felt like I was reading about a real person who had strengths and weaknesses like the rest of us. It was very well-written, as the above-mentioned bios were also, but this one is a lot shorter. It gives the essence of Elvis in a very respectful manner."
2,A Disappointment,"""Elvis Presley,"" by Bobbie Ann Mason, is an almost too intimate look into the conjectured feelings, rather than the events, shaping the life of ""The King of Rock 'n' Roll."" I was disappointed by both the writing style, which reminded me of backroom ""beauty shop-like"" gossip, and the content, which contained psychoanalysis of Presley. The continuous message that the society he was raised in as a child was the blame for the his adult downfall became the focus of the narrative; so much so that it made such a significant contributor to music history and cultural icon seem pathetic and uninteresting. The book is a good study for those interested in counseling or Freudian psychology; however, for those wanting a glimpse into the exciting and flamboyant life of Elvis Presley, this book is not recommended."
5,Kunz Pocket Plane,I needed a small plane for some model work that I am doing and this looked like just what I wanted. I got this little plane expecting to hone the blace but is was razor sharp and set perfectly right out of the box. I have used this little plane extensively over the past few weeks and I cannot say anything good enough about this plane. What really sets it appart is the really reasonable price that I paid. If you are working on small projects with relatively soft wood this is perfect. I have not yet tried it on some my harder woods but I do expect it will do a good job for me.
3,Shire's Discovering Artillery,"The physical size of the book was very small (4 1/2"" W x 7"" H). Good information and pictures, but because of small size, I'll will not keep it."
2,Not formatted effectively,"I downloaded this guidebook as a planning tool but, you can not navigate around the book easily enough to plan a trip and I can't imagine myself using it as my reference while traveling. You really need to be able to access a detailed index in a guide book to make it work. You also need to be able to comprehend your districts or zones in the country to be able to find things quickly but, every zone in the Table of Contents is labeled with a Korean name instead of a general description like ""northeast"" or ""central mountains"" which the beginner needs when trying to figure their itinerary out. Maps cannot be quickly referenced either. Most of these difficulties are likely common to all e-reader guidebooks. For now I suggest sticking with a printed version, at least for this one."
2,"Decent, but lacking...","To say that this guidebook is lacking would be a bit of an understatement, unfortunately. Why? Because, for example, it includes absolutely NO coverage of one of South Korea's larger cities, Ulsan, which is famous for being the home of the international Hyundai motor company, and was also one of the host cities during the World Cup in 2002. The population is over 1 million people, and to think that such a significant (if slightly industrial) city could be overlooked is proof that the authors of this guide have only scratched the surface of what Korea has to offer the world. Otherwise, I have to give them credit for producing a guide for the country AT ALL, considering that there are hardly any worth buying out that now as it is. I just recommend that for the next edition they do a little more research before publishing it."
3,Needs some serious thickening...,"This book was great for navigating around, but failed miserably when listing detailed information about particular destinations. I had to resort greatly to my own savvy and smart phone. Thank god for free wifi..."
1,Very badly put together,"I won't buy another Amazon Lonely Planet ""eBook"". it's poorly laid out and the hyper links mostly don't work at all and when they do, they send you to the wrong place. If you have an iPad, the Apple Lonely Planet eBooks are like real books."
4,Review,"Typical of the Lonely Planet series, this book is full of interesting and necessary information. From sightseeing, to restaurants and accomodation, I found it to be a good help. It also gives a great insight into the history and culture of Korea, with a food chapter and a language chapter included. It's not the bible but I would definitely recommend this book to anyone going to Korea. You should also supplement it with stuff from the net or your local Korean tourist office etc."
4,A good tour guide!,"I only used it in Seoul a few times, but the information was helpful and accurate. The subway directions were especially useful because the guide included which station exit to walk out of for a particular site. The food & drink section was a life saver because it lists Korean dishes written in English and Hangul."
3,"Lovely walks, could have been a better guide","I just spent a week in Seoul and I used this book along with the Moon handbook. I didn't purchase any of the Seoul focused books because they hadn't been updated recently. While some aspects of this book were good there were a few drawbacks. The good parts -- there were two good walks which allowed you to see parts of Seoul, the average tourist may not. The only non-Koreans we passed on these walks had the same guide book.The downside is that much of the information was not current. Prices have changed for sights, for base taxi fare, etc., etc. Also, this book did not focus on the very clean, quick, and useful subway system.While it was better overaall than the Moon book (less encyclopedic) -- I'd still rely on the KNTO, local websites, and a good concierge."
2,Disagreed srongly on what they call the Korean War,They wrongly refer to it as pointless. Look the war was important in stopping the spread of communism in Asia. It resulted in a very prosperous state of South Korea.It was too nasty to call the whole conflict`pointless. This statement ruins the`whole book.
5,The Best of the Best!,"If you're an average cook, be sure to buy this book because afterwards, you won't be! You'll be a master chef! The recipes are so very easy and you really don't have to worry about interpreting some strange cooking language like that in other cooking magazines. The editors make these recipes absolutely wonderful but easy too. I can't say enough good about them - just that I started with a couple and now I have over 30 Southern Living cookbooks and I use them all!"
5,Can't go wrong,"You can't go wrong with this excellent cookbook. It's not a ""how to"" basic cookbook, but it's a solid cookbook with great recipes. Great for someone collecting Southern Living cookbooks. Especially like ""Crabmeat Witchery"" and the ""Mississippi Mud Cake"" recipes."
5,Southern Living: 30 Years of Our Best Recipes,I borrowed this book from a friend because it has such great recipes. I have made several of the recipes in the book and they are fantastic. I felt so lucky to find out I could purchase this book on Amazon. I will be purchasing this book for my daughers.
4,Cool little camera!,This versitlile and very handy camera gives people an easy way to film everything from backyard football games to family reunions. I am definatly going to look into actually buying one for the holidays with my family. Hope this helps you!
1,"Like the size, not the quality","For the size and price its not a bad deal, but it didn't have the video quality i would've liked. The stills aren't bad but good lighting is needed. The video is very choppy and jumps around when recording. If you're looking for a cheap, small camera with video and don't need good quality, go for it. Overall I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
1,Lousy,"My digital still camera (a Toshiba MD700) takes better video. My daughter's toy video camera (the digital blue) takes better video. The quality on this is just utterly unacceptable. I don't know how much of that is the MPEG4, but I think part of it is the lens -- there's very noticeable distortion and light falloff around the edges. It's bad. I think Gateway tried too hard to pursue the pricepoint.I'd love to have a product like this one, if it produced decent video."
4,Pocket Cam is cool,It's useful on trips the movies it makes are cool and if it were cheaper I would buy a million of them
1,Camcorder?,"This product is advertised as an MPEG 4 camcorder on the gateway website, but the video capabilties are pathetic when compared to my sister's digital camera. The photos are mediocre at best and the software provided doesn't even support the video camera's format. If you want a digtal camera this might be ok, but it IS NOT a camcorder"
2,Item is not that great as it seems,"Well, at first it was a nifty little camera, but after a week, it something started to go wrong with it. I don't exactly know what it was, but now it won't turn on anymore, I tried new batteries and still nothing. The quality of the pictures is pretty good for being a 2.1 Mp, and its a nice little camera if you want to take pictures once in a while, but be carefull because they are defective."
5,My Granddaughter Loves Brio trains!,This was an Easter gift for my 2 year old granddaughter. She loved it and has played with it constantly. She loves her brio train and she loves cars so this combined her two loves. She has a train car for her train and a car to play with which is suppose to be on the train car. It is great and I never saw anything like it on any other web site!
1,"Beginners, avoid!","This is an incredibly bad book, really! It provides some insight into the background of Castaneda, the man, and as such might prove interesting to read for those who already are familiar with his books, but it gets the philosophy all wrong. It manages to kill all the magic of Castaneda. My advice: If you have already read his books, borrow this one. You are not likely to want to own it anyway. Beginners, avoid it at all cost. It can only mislead you. The background of Castaneda himself is not what his philosophy is all about."
1,"Don't buy this book, don't even read it!","Although this book does contain some interesting insights into Carlos Castaneda's background, it seems to have not even been proofread. Besides all the typos and unlegible type fonts, I was distrurbed to find that most of the material described in Castaneda's books had been misquoted, shortened, or completely fabricated."
3,Castaneda for Beginners,"Its mostly cute dialogs of Carlos the educated idiot with shaman priest don Juan, but lacks the action dramas of Carlos books"
3,Castaneda 101,"This book is a quick summery of Castaneda's life and written work in a comic book form. If you knew nothing about the man, it would be a good idea to pick it up, not worth buying new unless you keep a Castaneda collection."
4,Totaly Bloodhound gang,"i am a big fan of the bloodhound gang, and this is nothing different from their normal stuff. It's a very funny song and the franky goes to hollywood sample sounds great. I thooght packman was a little over the top with his drugds but Q and Jimmy quickly tell him how wrong drugs are. This is a really funny song and well worth listning to, so go ahead and get it, IT ROCKS!!!"
2,Not what I'd hoped,"All braided headbands are not created equal!Good points - soft, comfortableNegative - This headband did not keep its shape when washed! I washed in a laundry bag on perm. press cycle. It also is huge, and I have a big (7&3/4) head."
4,For the Reflective Practicioner,"This journal is just that...a personal journal. It guides you through several thought provoking scenarios and asks you how you feel, think, what you will/can do, etc. If you do not like to think, this is not a product you will enjoy. If, however, you enjoy noodling over your own thoughts, actions, feelings, and working through them to a plan for personal/professional development, this is a must buy item.Drucker is someone who yields more and more every time you read him. This journal will help you collect a rich harvest of useable ideas."
2,"Poor book, better books are available","This book is too much practical, no discussion of theory at all. Should not be recommended for any graduate course. May be useful for some applied purpose, but in that case books such as Applied Longitudinal data analysis by Fitzmaurice will serve better the purpose.I don't recommend this book at all."
2,"Warning, the Kindle version is terrible","""Blocky"" and ""splotchy"" text. I have not read this yet but if I did not absolutely need this book I would return if for a refund immediately. For $50, unacceptable IMO. It will be an adventure reading this; I hope I will be able to correctly interpret all the text characters."
4,Diving for Treasure,"This book, which was written for the juvenile and adult reader is both informative and entertaining. Mr Blassingame obviously spent a considerable amount of time both researching this subject and interviewing the persons involved. The book is easy to read, easy to follow, and would be enjoyable for all ages."
3,"Informative, but lacking details","Dr. Cherry's book is well written and informative but left me yearning for more. I wish he had included more details about the reasons why we should eat certain foods and avoid others instead of just directing us to purchasing some other publications he has written. Overall, it was enjoyable reading. I however preffered ""What the Bible Says About Healthy Living"" by Rex Russell. It is the same theme but gives more details. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to get an overview of what the Bible says about the foods we eat and our general health."
5,Wish I had read this excellent book when I was a parent!,"I bought this book at a conference to give to my daughter who is a new parent, and ended up reading it myself. I'm glad I did! It is an excellent book which leads you into surprising depths in a very warm and witty way. I wish I had had the benefit of Spangler's insights and philosophy when my children were all at home, but I found the teachings in this book are every bit as applicable and useful to me now as a person pursuing a spiritual path as they would have been when I was more actively parenting. This book is a wonderful discovery, and I intend to keep my copy for myself and get another for my daughter and now for my son as well, who is single!"
2,doesn't last!,"Sure my son got a fair amount of enjoyment from his gameboy and rechargeable power pak, but the power pak is only 3 months old and no longer takes a charge! There is no way to totally discharge it, thus clearing the ""memory"" and my attempts to contact Interact have been totally unsuccessful. I think I'll head out and just buy rechargeable batteries."
2,The Elements of Murder... and a cure for insomnia,I found this book a lot less engaging than I expected from the interview I heard with the author (which is what led me to buy the book).
3,disturbed earth,"Fine writing, especially the city's and characters' ""atmospherics'. Unfortunatelythe work is marred by a fairly convolutedand far-fetched plot."
4,Very entertaining,"I really didn't have an interest in poison until I heard Mr. Emsley on the radio. This book has a lot of history in it and being a history buff I found it really enjoyable. I've learned a great deal about the subject and was really suprised to find how much we are actually exposed to poisons on a daily basis. I was worried that perhaps this may be a rather dry book, but let me assure you it isn't. I found it very entertaing and would recommed it to anyone who has an interest in history or reading about true crime. Or even if you just want to make your boyfriend nervous!"
4,engrossing,"well written and engrossing. i'd call it fun, if the subject wasn't murder. it could have used a little better proof reading, as there were quite a few minor errors that got past spellcheck. really a minor flaw.one oversite i found interesting was in the mention of john nicholls of the university of kansas medical center. nicholls was involved in study of the jfk bullet fragments as described in the section on antinomy. but nicholls real interest was in anencephaly and the spike in incidence in the US in the 1920's,caused by lead poisoning in moonshine. so nicholls could have shown up in two chapters."
4,lists only periodic table elements as poisons,"This is a very well researched and detailed compendium of historical facts that have involved some kind of toxicological attack. Too bad it only lists as the toxic source the elements in the periodic table. For example, no word about toxins in mushrooms, that have definitely been used in the past for intentionally poisoning people."
3,"Some interesting elements, but not captivating...","A&E's biographies are typically so fantastic and intriguing, that perhaps I'm just expecting too much here, but this one on ""Geronimo"" just didn't hit the spot for me.The documentary did touch on the fact that Geronimo was believed to have ""the Power"" that delayed the sun's rise and enabled him to hide from his would-be captors in mysterious ways and be sheltered from injury and flying bullets.But the video was a bit too dry for me.I'm certainly glad I watched it. As I type this review and recall the details of the documentary, I realize that I did retain a great number of details about this legendary Native-American.So - I'd recommend the documentary as it contains good info, but it's a bit slow."
2,Not silent,Silent is not an accurate description. I can hear the constant sound of air whooshing through it like a little vacuum cleaner. Otherwise it works OK if you don't mind a little noise.
3,A good summary,"A good summary of the minolta line, but left me wanting more... I learned little of my camera (I dont have the owners manuals), and am left needing a more complete reference."
5,recipe covers,I make a mess when I'm cooking so I like having a way to protect the recipe & keep it like new.
4,"George MacDonald's ""Home Again""","This is an inexpensive paperback edition of an important book. However there are some typing errors in the text; there is no identified publisher; and the title page states ""Home Again""/ ""The Elect Lady""--implying there are two George MacDonald novels in the volume instead of only one."
3,It was helpful!,It helped me in my research. It gave me a wide understanding of what I was researchign on. I did not agree with the author in some points though!
3,Very good treatment of Plasma ionization,This book is an update of a classic from the 70's with material on galactic centers added. It is just good physical astronomy and has the spectroscopic concepts for observations of very distant objects.The diagrams are updated from the older version as well.More extensive indexes and other new material make it also a good long term reference book.
2,I could never get into this book.,"Perhaps it was just the professor, but I could never get into this book. I think its hopelessly boring, and like alot of graduate textbooks in astro, it has a TERRIBLE index. You can't find anything you need in terms of numbers or equations with the index, you must read the book cover to cover to know where something is.It also has way too many numbers scattered in tables, and you must read the chapter to know what assumptions were made when he calculated those numbers. Our entire class had such a difficult time with homework using this book that I doubt any of us would give a good review of the book.My own research is in AGN, and for the most part he does OK in explaining them but he can confuse you in comparing them."
2,"Boo, Osterbrock.","This text is poorly written and unclear. It fails to define variables, sometimes, and contains a few typos. It is also the only text to learn this stuff. It's a ""must be done."""
2,A decent product with one serious flaw,"This product description includes the following: ""The cue and review feature provides sound to be heard as the fast forward and rewind modes are used, a helpful tool when searching for specific passages."" Unfortunately there is no cue and review feature. There are buttons labeled cue and review, but they do nothing but fast forward and rewind, respectively. A call to SONY confirmed the fact: the agent said, ""on this product cue means fast forward."" Later she admitted that cue usually has another meaning. This makes the recording device nearly unusable for many purposes.Otherwise, the recorder works pretty well for the price. The radio is less satisfactory, and the earphones must be plugged in to provide an aerial, even when the speakers are used."
4,Beautiful album!,"Great rhythm, thought provoking lyrics...It's more something you'd plug in while you're riding than dance to in the club."
4,I'd Jam on It Even Now....,"....the reviewer from D.C. is right. I liked ""5 O'clock.."" when it was out because of the take no prisoners beat with that slightly dischordant bassline and the ""outside on the corner "" hook. But ""Until the Day"" with the Stevie sample and ""Crab Rappers"" are good, too."
5,Sign of the times,I bought these for a job site. They do what they are supposed to - tell people to keep out.
5,Beginner Telescope,"We bought this for our children a few months ago. Great way to get started into astronomy, has tons of additional components you can purchase to extend it's power, as well as photo equipment. No problems at all with it so far."
1,"Interesting, very interesting",I have to say I was reading those Pop Mags as I went on a trip to GB and I saw many complaints from readers of D&C. When I got home I decided to find this song and listen to it myself. I found it so bad it was quite Amusing. But as it would attract small children I was dissapointed with the message given in this song. As a final comment I would like to call D&C a new generation Chip and Dale chimpmunk with a Bad attitude. Don't bother with the CD if you wanna bother get for free with an MP3 system.
3,The Chorus is catchy but...,"D&C grow tired fast. I don't really like their first single ""Ooh Stick you"". Me and my friend sing the chorus as a joke but honestly, I wouldn't consider D&C as a credible band. I agree with some of the other reviewers in that the girls should set a better example but really, I think most kids just laugh at it and think its dumb like the rest of us. at first its fun to just laugh at the lyrics and sing a bit, but after awhile the chipmunk voices will get to you. But if u r looking for sumthin different in music then download this song, get your laughs and delete it!"
1,pathetic!,"I know D&C are supposed to be fun and not serious, but they are not setting a good example for kids. The kids who will listen to this are most likely kindergarten age, and teaching them to diss people like that, is just rude! it's encouraging teasing which is a problem among younger kids. I think D&C need to grow up and change their image! save your money and move past this one"
1,Urrrccchhh,I am Daphne and Celestes no#1 hater. This song is so boring and annoying. They are so manufactured and untalented!! What was the point of writing a song about themselves? YUK!!
5,Good job,This a good record cleaning tool. It cleans dust out of the groves with out damaging the LP. It will keep my records sounding good for years.
1,Over-Priced !!! Not effective !!!,Product is useless in my opinion and was not worth the price I paid. I would not order this item ever again.
3,brush fibers get matted down,"It cleans records as advertised and does a fair job. The brush works well dry at removing dust and other particles. The fluid is also effective. However, after repeated use I've noticed that the fibers on the area of the brush where the fluid was applied have become matted down and thus are less effective at reaching into the groves."
5,Very Effective Tool,"Although the price seemed a little high for the particular type of tool, I must admit that this is the most effective and simple record cleaner I have used. I often pick up records in thrift stores that are undamaged but dirty - every thing from heavy dust to mold from a record sleeve that had become wet during some past flood. If you follow the straightforward directions, this does an very effective job of picking the debris out of the record grooves."
3,An easy to read description of the battle(s) of the Bismarck,"Being a lover of mysteries, I was hoping that this book addressed the almost daily bad orders of Admiral Lutjens. But it only addresses a few of them and even then finds excuses for them. However, for a nutshell account of the Bismarck's last days, it is an excellent book and should be in any naval historian's library. But I am a purist and take more credence Baron Burkard von Mullenheim-Rechberg's account of the battles since he was there and was one of the fortunate few survivors to be plucked out of the water. I was also disappointed that another crucial encounter of the Bismarck was never mentioned that actually aided in ""his"" screening from British RADAR. Overall, the book is a good summary of fact for fact without going into a lot of conjecture and second guessing. I was able to read it in one afternoon and found it enjoyable regardless of any misgivings I had."
4,My son loves it.,"I got this for my 3 year old son for Chrismas the one we got was blue & yellow. He & his older brother call it Brewster (from Disney's Chugginton). They use it on the Melissa & Doug Wood Rail Road Set. It has been through a lot with the two boys, but seems to be holding up fine."
3,Too expensive,Too expensive for the amount and level of information presented. You can get most of that from other cheaper books...and from Google or consumer-segmentation companies' websites.
2,not a growth chart,"this book is cute, but I was looking for a growth chart for my son. the title on Amazon is growth chart, but I think it got in there because it has a pull out poster that is in fact a game, NOT a growth chart. If you want a cute coloring book with a pull out poster, this book is fine; if you are looking for a paper growth chart, as I was, it is the wrong book."
1,Wish I would have read the review first,"I, too, purchased this coloring book because I was looking for a growth chart for my Thomas obsessed son.The price is high (and what IS a sourcing fee?) for this six page long book. The poster inside is cute and is currently hanging in my son's room. However, we're still looking for a growth chart."
3,"The bits that work are great, but...","This is a review of the full Half-Life 2 game running on 2.6GHz Pentium with 512Meg RAM and GForce 6200 video card.The graphics, story-line, and voice acting in this game are all worthy of 5 stars. The gravity gun alone is worth a star. But I can't remember another game that is so unstable. I had to skip an entire chapter because my computer crashed every time it tried to load the chapter. I had to use cheat codes to unlock all the chapters and then start a new game at the next one.I sent an email to Valve but, no suprise, I got no response. I checked the FAQs but all they suggest is to update the drivers (I already did, duh).Apart from that, the game keeps crashing unpredictably and there is a huge problem with one of the npcs right now who appears to be wearing a roof around her waist instead of a skirt. Makes it pretty tricky to see around her.Because of all the stability problems and the loss of an entire chapter I can only give this game a 3 star rating."
2,5MP Camera?,Having sold digital cameras and knowing what a 5MP camera can really do... I would not recommend this camera after playing with the setting for several weeks I was only able to achive a grainy 4 x 6 any larger and you can for get it. i guess you really do get what you pay for!Its now time to sell the Gateway and move to a Sony where you can find true quality in the product and the picture.
2,I won't drag this out!,Do Not Buy this camera! Far from user friendly...lsd display works only in very well lite areas....to take a picture you need to hold the button down for a good 5 or 6 seconds....heavy and bulky...batteries are dead in about 1 hour of actual use (no joke) takes 4 AA batteries. Not pleased at all...its on its way back to Amazon...exchanging for a Canon....don't let the 5mp sell you on this camera...i hope this sends you in a different direction....sorry I dragged this out..
4,Gateway 5.0 megapixel camera,"I agree that it is not on par with other ""5 megapixel"" cameras, but it was also much more affordable. The picture quality was crisp and easy to transfer to my computer. No need to buy a docking station or other peripheral hardware. If you're looking for an affordable camera on a budget, this does the trick."
1,It's sucks..............,"What a horrible camera.....heavy, bulky, slow, I think the worst of all was the LCD, its dark, blurry, slow.....The pictures most of all are blurry.....And the battery die quickly....Dont let impress for the 5 MP...I had to sell it on ebay (almost as a gift, there are really other option....."
4,Algo sobre grandes enigmas...,"Este libro presenta grandes enigmas y varias interpretaciones de ellas pero estas no son muy buenas.....siguen siendo enigmas. Es una buena lectura para hacer crecer el conocimiento de uno sobre el mundo y ""sus"" maravillas."
2,This is the small one,"Be aware!! Besides the price, this one is the small one. 75ml/2.5 oz.I got frustrated when I saw that, because we can find another sellers here on amazon with really cheaper prices for the small product.I didn't use it yet so I'm not talking about the quality of the product but about the advertisement that doesn't say anywhere the size of it. :( See the cheaper one. (ps. I got the cream that looks like this advertisement below)Mustela Special Maternity Lotion, Stretch Marks Intensive Action 2.5 oz (75 ml)"
4,Janet and Ron Barr,Product is exactly as the product it replaced. Good quality product and a reasonable price. Shipping time line was very good.
1,Sad waste of 19.99,"Of the things it claims to do, I couldn't find one that I couldn't download FAR superior as freeware."
1,MP3 Wizard 3.0 Error Message Parade,"I bought the Wiz and it does not work on Windows XP. When I fist installed it it gave me a couple error flags. First was it couldn't see my burner and the second was ""run time error 680, DAC not initialized"". On the Data becker site they offer a few patches to solve the problems. Unfortunately, they only solved one. My burner is now seen but ""run time error 680..."" is still stopping the program from running. I sought tech advice from Data Becker but they don't respond.My recommendation: Don't buy this if you're using XP."
5,Jeff Bates does it again!,"Go buy this CD and go straight to the title cut on your CD player.........and you're going to be hooked forever, if you're not already. There isn't enough space here to say all the good things I'd love to say about Jeff and his band, ""Good People"". They are so talented and have very friendly and outgoing personalities. JEFF in CONCERT is something you should put on your ""must see"" list. You won't be sorry! The Rainbow Man CD featured many true tales of Jeff and his life and this one basically picks up where that left off. Jeff has always been open and honest about his life and the mistakes he's made, and on this CD you'll hear some of that as you both laugh and cry with him.If you only buy one CD this year, make it ""Leave the Light On"" by Jeff Bates. If you don't like it, email me and I'll buy it back from you!"
2,Jeff Bates Leave the light on,I never knew a voice could sound that good but his does and I hope that he keeps up the good work.He has a strong voice and should be heard more often on radio.A friend of mine bought one of his CD at one of his concerts and it was the best I have heard in a long time.Your music sounds like it is coming from your heart.The one song that really stood out alot to me was Mama was alot like Jesus.I think that it should be your next release.It's a very touching ballad and I think people will want to hear more.A new and dedicated fan.Gerarda Watson
2,ARRIVED DEFECTIVE,"I have owned numerous Celestron telescopes up to 11-inch apertures, so I expected better. I ordered this for my daughter - it arrived defective; the primary mirror had slipped from its bracket, making collimation impossible. In Celestron's defense, it likely happened in transit. Amazon's return policy is not a hassle, and I'm upgrading her to another telescope. I'm sure that had this particular scope not arrived in a defective condition it would have made a great scope. Only criticism is the plugs on the back to cover the collimation screws pop out a bit too easily."
1,Celestron Explorascope 80mm Reflector Telescope,The eye piece that comes with the scpe is practicaly unuseable.But of course you can 'buy' the eye piece that really works separately from the manufacturer.The whole thing was a waste of time...I gave it to my five year old to trash. At least he will have some fun with it that way....it's realy just a childs toy.
1,NOT a good telescope for children,This is not at all suitable for young children. It's awkward and difficult to use. We're sending it back. Totally inappropriate for children.
1,Celestron Explorascope 80mm Reflector Telescope,We have NOT received this item yet.Please let me know the current status.
3,Not as good as the original,"When I was a kid I read his original book about the Miracle Mets, and really enjoyed it. This one was good, but just not as compelling. It was cool, though, to find out what happened in some of the players' lives."
2,average off the mill opening guide,Millions variations with out explaining basic ideas behind them.It's more of less guide with out any directions for an averageplayer. You better off buying Nunn's Chess Openings.I kind of threw away money by buying this book.
1,Ewwwww,"Horible to the endth degree so not realistic I mean come on Bears eating poridge? Last time I checked bears ate meat, and humans theres no way little mis goldie would have lived to see another day after a Full grown Mother bear and Father bear were standing over her!!!!!!!!!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Remarkably comprehensive,"Organized in a Q&A; format with good color illustrations, this ""Pocket Catechism"" is about sixty pages and would make a nice stocking stuffer. And bulk packaging allows purchasers to keep copies on hand for inquirers or to place in parish literature racks. This little booklet is remarkably comprehensive. In addition to matters of doctrine, it addresses disciplines and canon law. The current version was released in 2003 and is in conformity with theCatechism of the Catholic Churchand bears an imprimatur, an imprint that guarantees it is error-free. Given the format, subsequent editions could incorporate language from theCompendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church(released in 2006.) Recommended."
3,Don't install on older motherboards!,Check the mobo compatability list before you buy this. If you install this on an older motherboard it will screw up your operating system (thank God for system restore). This card doesnt work with Pentium 4 motherboards at all.
4,Perfect sata port expansion,"I've had Promise cards in the past, and when I bumped into it searching for a way to expand my EVGA 750i 4 ports, I hoped this was it, and it was.Very easy to install, almost plug and play. Did not have to move anything in my bios, just load the drivers in W7, reboot, and it was running.I have this running the extra esata connector of my case, to a dock, and an extra HD inside. It runs smooth.I was hoping promise would come out with a PCI 6G, for Mobos that only have two or one pcie ports already taken by graphic cards. But this is one is 3G, just as the rest of my Mobo's ports, so for people that are looking to only expand port availability, but do not have pciex4 or faster available ports and only have normal PCI ports, this one is your best bet. My only ""if"" is that it is not 6G and can't take advantage of my Raptors and Black Caviar's blazing 6.0 Gbps. Otherwise its great."
5,Promise 4-port SATA Controller,"I purchased the controller for my linux file server. The controller was very easy to install and operates perfectly. This is my second Promise controller, the original is still operating perfectly after 3 years of operation. I am very satisfied with Promise products."
1,"""No Security"" followup","I wrote the previous ""No Security"" review. Wanted to add a real upsetting problem that I'd failed to mention. This software provides no indication that it's completed it's actions. There is no notification that what you asked it to do, is actually done. You have to guess when the operation is complete. This could be up to an hour to complete a ""fast disc wipe""...several hours to complete a Dept Of Defense type wipe. You guess wrong, and you've screwed up the whole deal.....start over. This software is clearly created by folks who don't know how to write software. Flaws abound and abound. Irritating to any user, but scary in that it resets itself to defaults that allow maximum intrusion. Scratch your head and wonder how any PC Security company could use that as a default setting. Mindblowingly (...) design."
1,False Security,"I've installed Mc Internet Security with MS XP. Every time I log off, all settings are automatically returned to allow maximum intrusion. The general internet ""FILTER"" is turned off, FIREWALL is turned off. Lower level settings are DISABLED. This is first of all, a security risk, worse because you'd assume it's automatically in place (ie: just as you had set it in the last session). Secondly, it's a major hassle once you understand that it resets itself to zero security evey time you log off. This is NO SECURITY in my opinion. If you use this system, check out it's behaviour. If you want to buy this system to protect yourself...it's an illusion. I can no longer trust this product."
1,Don't expect help,"McAfee has a great virus program, the equal of Norton. I wanted some internet security so I bought the McAfee Inertnet Security 4.0 package. It is supposed to be XP compatible but when I installed the Internet Security and Firewall package it disabled my Outlook Express. When I went to their website they said that if this happens right click on the VShieled and then click the ""Properties"" sub menu. Well there is no ""Properties"" submenu when you right click the VShield.I emailed their Tech Support and they said that if the VirusScan works well then: ""If this is the case then you must be having conflicts with Internet Security and Firewall portions of the MIS product. We are sorry our product did not meet your expectations"". This is their actual response; no offer to help no refund no patch or whatever.Stick with Norton, I wish I did.William Cely MDPacific Programming"
1,DO NOT BUY MCAFEE INTERNET SECURITY 4,"I concur with the other reviews. This product is horrible to install, fails to run successfully under Windows XP with more than one user, and McAfee tech support is worthless. Even after loading every patch available and reinstalling the product multiple times it is still not working properly. The folks at McAfee need to read these reviews and get their act togehter."
1,worst product I've ever seen,how can this be a product considering competing companies such as norton and zonealarm?
1,I don't understand ...,"... how the company that is #1 in corporate virus/security can make a product which is either: (1) too hard for the average to moderately skilled user to configure properly, or (2) crashes internet access and internet explorer with a combination of rather scary errors. After uninstalling McAfee Internet Security 4.0, all the errors went away.I bought the program based on McAfee's reputation, and wrongly thought the other bad reviews were sour grapes, competitors, or incorrect installs/configurations. I was wrong."
3,Ehh,I didnt really care for this book or for the class I took that required this book. I guess if you are into geometry like that its great but for a college junior who is just trying to graduate its just another book.
5,Foundations of Geometry by Gerard A. Venema,"""Foundations of Geometry"" is a good textbook, even if you don't know about geometry. study hard. Geometry is EVERYWHERE! :)"
4,He definitly is worth checking out,"Unlike the majority of the southern rappers, K-rino always tries to seperate himself from them as he shows those deep emotional and political issues that are involved in society. Not only that but he has rhyming skills just like any great mc that you can think of. Personally I would say K-rino is the best of the Texas but i know alot of people will disagree. K-rino has been rappin since 1983 its a shame not many people know who he is but those that do know him have mad respect for him.R.I.P. to A.C. Chill & Big HAWK"
1,Hopelessly biased,"This book paints Mary Baker Eddy much larger than life. It bombards the reader with her healing work and love while glossing over problems that I have seen more fairly treated in other Eddy biographies. It also perpetuates the traditions and myths taught to Christian Science children, such as the myth that Eddy experienced an immediate and lasting healing three days after her famous fall on the ice. (Several MONTHS after the accident she tried to extract monetary damages for her injuries, on the grounds that she was STILL SUFFERING.)Von Fettweis and Warneck had access to over 21,000 of Eddy's unpublished letters and writings; what a shame they chose to perpetuate myths rather than using the documents to present a realistic and fair view of their spiritual leader."
2,My Second Pair,"I recently purchased this shoe in black, and it was so comfortable that I decided to order a second pair in tan. The second pair arrived but fit tighter than my first pair, even though they are both labeled the same size. Being leather, I hoped that they would loosen as I began to wear them, but unfortunately they never did. After about a half hour wearing them, I have to take them off to give my feet a break. Love the color, but they really hurt too much to even wear them at all!"
5,Comfortable & stylish,Very comfortable and stylish. Perfect for dressing up or down. Took a four day business trip recently and only took these shoes and my running shoes for working out.
3,Cole Haan Men's TVL,"Right O, this is a good shoe and very well made. I don't feel as if the shoe is true to size (at least for me - US 15W) out of the box. Not sure I'd buy them but that said, I am not entirely annoyed since it's a chance you take buying stuff online. Cheers!"
1,Plantar Fasciitis,Horrible shoe. Really awful. Whatever they use in the heal breaks down very quickly and causes (what my husband's orthopod calls) plantar fasciitis...which the dr. doesn't really have a way to fix. Husband's in horrible heal pain despite not wearing the shoes anymore. Never had any problem like this until these shoes. Bummer is I bought both the black and the brown and now he's not only hobbling but he also has to go buy dress shoes again. Awful product - don't buy it regardless of the price.
