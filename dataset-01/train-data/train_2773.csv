3,One mechanical feature un-reliable,"Have this brand new Canon ZR85 for about 3 weeks. All satisfaction so far except 1 serious mechanical feature. Explain below:This camcorder is for making movie, that means ""move"" (not still). The tape is for 1 hour, that means need to mount on something that move rather than to hold steady by hand and move arround to capture movie for that whole hour.I mount the camcorder on a swivel head from Bogen-Manfrotto, and the swivel head mount on my bicycle. I ride the bike on fairly good pave road with little road vibration to record scenery for several hours.Turn out that the camcorder mounting base is made out of non-metal (plastic) can not take vibration and the thread become damage. Is this considered that user's abusing or manufacturer false to not design carefully for the ""mov""ie device?I have to turn myself to become a ""tripod"" now since my ZR85 has no longer usable mounting base."
2,Suddenly stopped recording - update a month later,"Was a good camera until it suddenly stopped recorder video. Now I understand Cannon will fix it free? Well if they do, I'll probably buy from them again....otherwise???? Not real happy with the reliablity. Update... Called Canon Co and they sent a box and instructions to send in for repairs. They paid all shipping, and repairs! Excellent customer service!"
5,Great Mini Dig Vid Cam,This cam works great and never had any problems with mine. Great deal even contains a microchip for color etc that only high end camcorders have but itsn't really mentioned.
1,Cassette stuck...,"I was reading the prior review and am mad. I have a ZR 30 and have continual problems with the cassette sticking and eating up my dv tapes. I have just lost a lot of footage which I hoped to make into a program for our art group.We are having a big show soon.There are really no good options. I can get my camcorder serviced, but that costs $150. Or they will give me this machine the ZR 85, which also sounds horrible. Since customers report sticking on it too, I don't see any options. Why can't they fix such a simple thing - its not rocket science."
3,It works but painful install,I could not get my Maxtor 120 GB disk drive to fit into this enclosure without grinding down the edge of the circuit board to provide clearance for the ribbon cable. Even then the ribbon cable is pressed tightly between the edge of the board and the connector that plugs into the disk drive. I hope it does not puncture the ribbon cable's insulation and cause a failure somewhere down the line. Once the mechanical installation was done the system came up without problems.
3,Wrong item pictured in add,"The product pictured in the add is the new model of this product. The product being sold is is the older product, which the seller probably has in surplus. Although the older model is a finely built Gerber knife, with which I can find no defect, it does NOT have the nicer lines of the new model."
2,Barley pellets,I bought these after hearing this helps fight Algae in fish ponds. I could tell no difference in algae growth using this product.
3,no noticeable results,"Not entirely sure what should be expected of the product in what time frame, bu thus far (about a month) haven't noticed anything different in our pond."
3,Not bad for the size.,"This small size shop vac works well, but is prone to tip over. I didn't like the fact that you had to modify the filter if you want to clean up wet or dry items. It also seemed to get clogged on someitems which I tried vaccuuming - I think I tried to use the productbeyond what was intended."
3,Dale Jr. Shirt,The shirt has good graphics and the shirt material is of good quality. Fits well and washes well it will not shrink. Nice shirt for the price
4,Very Good Local History Book,"This book is extremely well written and organized. It is better than the run of the mill railroad history. Mr. Taibi is a good writer and a cut above the average ""hobbyist"" author. It will undoubtedly be of great interest to any local history buffs and the hard core O&W fan. Most of the information included herein (data, maps and photos), other than what's related to the initial formation of the Utica and Rome branches, is from the post 1900 era. If you are looking for mainly pre-1900 information you are likely to be disappointed."
5,Excellent eurodance album,"The first Solid Base album is, after ""Express"", my second favourite from this project. It was released in 1996, so it's more classic eurodance than ""Express"". With the exception of ""Never Find A Love"", which is another ballad that should not be on a eurodance album, the rest is great stuff. My favourite track has to be ""How Can We Survive"", well, it's classic eurodance. Other nice tracks in this style are ""Let It All Be Sunshine"", ""Stars In The Night"", ""Mirror Mirror"", ""In Your Dreams"", ""Fly To Be Free"", ""Together"", well this is all awesome stuff. I also love ""All My Life"" and ""Dancing With An Angel"". These tracks are euro-reggae this time, a bit like Ace Of Base, more in the dance style however. ""Bom Bom Bam Bam Bay"", ""You Never Know"", these are dance tracks but not really classic eurodance. This album is simply a must-have for eurodance lovers like me. Also check out their other albums... they are all great."
4,Happy Feeling!,"This is pretty much an alternate take on the ""Gratitude"" CD. But the flow and sequence is more like an actual concert and gives the listener a feel of what those mid '70's shows were really like. The standouts here are ""Happy Feeling"" - try not to move your feet to this jam. ""Sun Goddess"" (were the vocals on the ""Gratitude"" version overdubbed?) and the next three cuts, ""Evil"", ""Kalimba Story"" and ""Reasons"",(again essentially the same arrangement of ""Gratitude""- sans Philip Bailey's histronics, make up the meat and best section of the CD. The title track starts out strong but then runs out of gas towards the end. Overall, this is a CD strictly for fans who probably have ""Gratitude"" already. Oddly enough, the sound quality is better on the ""Live in 75"" set and audience participation is more woven in. But new listeners would be better served by the ""Gratitude"" CD. But on its own this is a fine offering."
2,not up to Maurices' standards...,"This disc is recommended only for the hardcore fan. Columbia released this I'm sure without the blessing of Maurice. This cd is the sound of a band in development...wavering tempos,sloppy playing, amateurish and unrefined. I'm a BIG EWF fan, but no way can I recommend this cd just because I love the group. For a tight sound and great improvisational playing, I suggest 1980's recording ""Live in Rio"" released in 2002. For great sound but no horns - try ""Greatest Hits Live"" recorded in Tokyo in 1996 with Maurice. (His last tour, I believe. Graditude is also a more polished effort than Live in 75' and recorded only six months later"
3,ITS OKAY,WILL NEVER TOUCH GRATITUDE BUT ITS EWF I LOVE THIS GROUP AND I HAVE EVERYONE OF THEIR CDS. SO ITS JUST GOOD HEARING THEM DO THERE THING
4,Serious Knife,"This is a serious knife. I bought it for my survival pack, and I'm glad I did. It is beyond sharp, very solidly built and looks menacing to boot. The sheath is good quality, but is a bit tight on the knife. Not sure how I feel about that right now. If the knife were tied to my leg I think I could pull it out just fine, probably just difficult while holding the sheath in one hand and the knife the other. Definitely worth the money."
2,Is This Necessary?,"As a fan of Nanci Griffith for many years, I was delighted at the prospect of a new ""Best of"" CD. That is, until I saw that 15 of the 22 cuts on ""From a Distance"" were previously released together on an earlier compilation, ""The MCA Years: A Retrospective,"" issued in 1993 and still readily available. Which begs the question: Why is this CD necessary? If the material itself is glorious, the marketing motivation for re-re-releasing it is much less so. I would encourage potential buyers of this to instead purchase the earlier compilation, which also includes the great songs ""Deadwood South Dakota,"" ""So Long Ago"" and ""Listen to the Radio,"" and also buy the live CD ""One Fair Summer Evening."" Then one would have truly the finest of Nanci Griffith's music from those MCA years."
3,Somethin's Missin',"A Nanci Griffith compilation without ""Spin on a Red Brick Floor""? Without ""Workin' in Corners""? Sorry. This smacks of another record company attempt to further line their pockets. I'm sure if you ask Nanci, she'd give you a whole different list of songs for this album."
4,It was good...,"I didn't know it was refurbished.But..I was very happy when I got this CD player.I has a album function, and it was especially good, cause I could pick a song I want to listen out of 120 songs.I want to recommend this item, if you don't mind refurbished goods."
2,"okay for the price, but that's about it",Cons:- 100-second anti-shock does not really makes the playback skip-free; in most cases it only delays the skip by 100 seconds- when playing mp3s it skips the first and the last few (1-5) seconds of every song- there's no ID3 tag display- not loud enoughPros:- remote control- the price is REALLY good
2,not good,"the overall quality of this cd player is ok but some part really stink. it uses triple a batteries which i dont no why but run out really fast. i always had to use the peice to add on double a batteries. the music play is ok,its smooth and all."
3,Adjustment to Description,"Well, I got this player, and yes, it works as described, however, the description says it includes Carry Case (it didn't), that it includes the AAA batteries (again, it didn't).Just beware of these things when purchasing this."
1,THIS THING [STINKS}!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I got it and it did NOT read CD-RWs. The remote is for a 4-year old's hands. It cuts out about 10 seconds off the end of each song. It stops about every 70 seconds to buffer more music, then doesnt start again for a while. It takes up a lot of room to be able to use the AA batteries. No sound quality. Those were just some of the problems. IT [stinks]!!!My advise for those who already wasted a bill is to take it back and say its defective and get a Riovolt."
2,not so good flavor,"the flavor is the worst I've tasted. Haribo let me down I've had other candy by them and it has been good to above par, not this time."
3,interesting work,"A fine example of the 18th c. Requiem Mass, although certainly not in the same league as that by Niccolo Jommelli or Michael Haydn. The performance is generally fine, but intonation suffers in the voices, partciularly the sopranos."
5,Anarchy Burger......Hold the Government!,"WOW! What more can be said, except possibly the greatest punk rock band of all time puts out an older show on DVD loaded with enough bonus features to make your head spin. Even includes a ""Vandals sell out"" segment in which drummer Josh Freeze is shown back in 1985 doing TV commercials for a toy drum set. If your a huge Vandals fan like me you must own this, and if your not, buy it anyway, the price is well worth it."
3,You + Me = Love is included elsewhere,"The nearly 11 minute 12"" version of the infamous disco jive song is actually included on cd labeled DISCO CONNECTION, also found on Amazon, and as for the Undisputed Truth? True, I am a big fan of 70s, even 60s soul, but this group was never for me other than the big disco song. I much rather hear stuff like Papa Was A Rolling Stone, Ball Of Confusion from other groups."
5,Love It Love It Love It,I put this light weight can on my Christmas list last year. It's great for pruning and deadheading flowers. I used it all spring and summer and it's still in great shape. If it weren't I'd be buying another because I can't get along without it.
3,Gardening containers,These seem to be more flexible than the older models I've used. Not nearly as good as the hard shell.
1,Disappointed - Poor Quality,I used this container for a week and the spring on the bottom is showing. Would never purchase again. The Fiskars Kangaroo Gardening Container I had before lasted 10 years.
4,Two versions - one better than other,"I have the model with the harder plastic bottom...I love it! Can't imagine this soft bottom would hold up quite as well for the uses I put mine through. Mine is my constant companion whenever I am working in the garden and it is as tough as I am on it. If I were to improve anything on mine, it would be a few clips of some kind on the outside to hold the bag from sliding down around the edges sometimes. I am a 59 year old woman and have bought/tried soooo many other products...none as good as this one or the hard bottom (which I own)."
4,Garden Container,"We owned one of these before and it wore out, so we were pleased to find another one on-line. We like it a lot."
3,Nice but,"First class item, but my wife and I are still using the old coal bucket, bags, and a tarp to haul stuff. This looks nice; the others are wellworn; so it adds to the appearance of my garage."
1,Bad Supplier,"The product may or may not be good. But the Supplier - Brand Variety is definitely one to be avoided. They took my money for expedited delivery and didn't do it. Then they initially refused to agree to a return of the order and more than 4 days afte the order was placed, they have no tracking info on where the order might even be. Avoid them at all costs!!!!"
2,no precautions about its fragility,"Although it is a wonderfully handy tool, the dumping handle tore the fifth time I used it. A note in the instructions about the maximum weight it is designed to hold would have been useful."
2,"great idea, poor durability","I will have to differ with others who rave on this. The loop that let's you button the thing flat broke the first time I used it. After a reasonable amount of use, the spring started coming through the sides. Pricey for a less than well-made piece of equipment. Wish it could be tougher"
4,Fiskars 94056974 30-Gallon Kangaroo Container,"Price was good, although a little higher than other similar products I have seen.Shipping was very slow; it took a month to receive the itemProduct itself is 5 star quality. Double layer construction, ties on 2 sides to hold it closed, carrying handles, waterproof, holds its shape whether empty or full of leaves. The container looks like it will be hanging in my shed, ready to use, for a number of years. Excellent product!"
3,Friskars 30g Collapsible Container,"I bought this product because I needed something to hold my trash bags as I filled them. It got a lot of good reviews, but is next to useless for its intended purpose. For one thing the 30 gallon size is actually 43 gallons. I did the math. A ""standard"" 30 gallon trash bag does not fit! The container is 9 inches bigger around than the trash bag. I looked in the stores and the average 30 gallon trash bag is 60 inches in circumference. The Friskars is 69 inches. Somewhere it was said the Friskars had holes in the bottom to let water drain. It doesn't. Using an oversized bag might work."
3,Kangaroo Gardening Container,"Very handy when pruning and weeding. Don't have to lug a large and heavy trash container. Stores easily in a small space. However, the bottom is easily cut by small branches. I have already used duct tape to repair after less than a month."
1,B A D B A D B A D,"Bought this because of the brand and my great satisfaction with other Fiskars products. This purchase was totally-- and I do mean totally--disappointing. By the second light use, signs of wear were already evident around the bottom casing. Now the wire along the bottom has come out almost entirely and I'm just limping along until I can find another brand. I wouldn't wish this item on my worst lawncare/yardwork enemy."
4,Fiskars Kangaroo Gardening Container,Purchased this to use as a trash can for clippings. Love that it is collapsible. The only problem I have with it is that it is to big around for trash bags to fit. I use office binder clips to keep the trash bags open.
2,No drainage,This container has no drainage holes for water so buyer beware. I had a similar one from Home Depot that was great. Little perforations in the bottom allow water to seep out. With all the rain we have had in the Northeast this summer this container was impossibly heavy when I tried to move it yesterday. I had to turn it on its side to drain the water. Not good!
5,Great idea,"This is going to be a camp trashcan,leaf hauler and probably a few other things before I'm through. Great portable idea."
5,Great product,Where has this thing been all my life? Makes yard cleanup a breeze and stores away handily when not in use.
3,Not like they used to be,Solid construction. Just a little disappointed in the coil. I bought one of these containers a few years ago and it stand ups much better than this one. The coil is just not as strong in the newer ones than in the one I bought 2 years ago.
5,I like it!,"I needed a basket for when I cut the grass. This works great, and I haven't managed to tear it up yet. 30 gallon trash bags give you a little bit to flip over the lip to hold it in place, but once the bag is full it pushes against the sides and you have to preform minor acrobatics to get the bag out. (I just step on the handles to pull the sides down.) A hook on the wall is all I use to store it. I'm a fan!"
1,Put the Container in the Garbage Container,Was suprised by the poor quality of the 30 Gallon Gardening Container #94056974 compared to the one I had for over 5 years.. After Two weaks of using it for grass clippings it has been put out for garbage.. The bottom has ripped amd it has holes in it from bringing it to the curb... and and it dosnt stand as upright as the previous one did... It may be good bargin only if i was growing cotton in my yard....
2,CD-ROM Professional's CD-Recordable Handbook,"This book may well fit the needs of professionals who have need for the wealth of specifications and comparative information found in the book. However, the information is not particularly useful for the casual user, and the descriptions of hardware and software do not match the market in 1999 at all. (Adaptec is not even mentioned as a supplier of software.)"
4,excellent tool,Excellent gardening tool for those mid sized cuts. Good weight and excellent cutting power.
3,Don't try on large branches,"This unit works well for small branches. The light weight is appreciated, and the stainless blade is a useful upgrade as standard blades rust from the tree sap. But I used mine on some heavier branches, still within the recommended diameter range, and something slipped so that the blade no longer touches the anvil. The tool therefore is practically useless, as you do not get a clean cut. There is no way to adjust or fix this pruner when that happens. And the lifetime warranty is of dubious value, as you must send the tool back at your expense, plus keep and be able to find the original receipt. They should model their warranty after Craftsman."
1,The first time I used them the blade broke.,"I bought these for their size and also the many good reviews. I planned on using them for keeping the local trails clean where I hike and mountain bike.Today on a somewhat rainy Sunday I went for a hike to see how the trails were and in my pack I had the loppers.I went to use them to cut back some low overhanging pine branches, about 3/4"" in diameter and after the third one I hear a crack, and notice that the blade now has a big chip missing out of it. The chip is about a third of the cutting surface.Of course, I don't know where the receipt is because I bought them shortly after X-mas.This is the second Fiskars item that I've had trouble with, now I've learned better than to purchase Fiskars products."
5,Endures the test of time,I have had this pruner for about 7 years and it has earned its keep. Great for everything that's too big for your regular clippers and you don't want to drag out the big loppers. A must for pruning roses.
3,Fiskars 7972 15-inch PowerGear Lopper,"Fiskars is an excellent brand but these loppers are a little disappointing. From the picture it looks like the gear mechanism works like a ratchet to increase the force or power of the loppers with less physical exertion. These do not perform that way, they are just loppers. I purchased them because of their compact size hoping they would ratchet through 1 inch branches easier. I am a master garderner and wanted something smaller to carry in my tool bucket when I am gardening at our projects. They do fit in my bucket, but are harder to work than what I wanted."
4,Perfect product. Pesky sticker,"Fiskars makes great products and these loppers are no exception. They are insanely light and really easy to use. I use them for some light gardening, but primarily, I take them with me on backpacking trips for minor trail maintenance. They weigh just less than 1 pound.The only drawback to these loppers, and the reason I only gave 4 stars, is a huge sticker on one of the handles. I figured I'd leave it on. That was until the edges started peeling back and the glue became exposed. So, I tried to peel the thing off only to battle against sticker and glue remnants for about an hour. Come on, Fiskars. Find an alternative material for that cheap sticker or don't put it on there."
5,Great service. Very efficient.,Very satisfied with their product and service. I would buy with them again. Richard BryckProduct works well. Thanks much.
5,Love these loppers,"These Fiskars anvil loppers are a godsend to any gardener, especially a non-muscular, shall we say mature one like myself. It's the power gear aspect of them that makes cutting a breeze. They're amazingly lightweight but can cut virtually any shrub or branch of the appropriate size without exhausting me by the end of the day. A friend gave them to me for Christmas one year and it's made all the difference in my ability to prune. So when my daughter and her husband were doing some gardening in the backyard of their new house this summer, I loaned them these. My son-in-law went on and on about them so naturally I bought them these for this Christmas. I also bought them the Fiskars hedge trimmers which I review in another space. All the Fiskars power gear tools are just wonderful."
3,CAROLINE QUENTION WHERE ARE YOU!,"What a way to start,on the product detail Caroline Quention is listed in season 4 which she is not,Amazon should get it's facts straight,might not look so good that someone screwed up.Julia Sawalha is in series 4 plays Carla Borrego and in my mind she was not a good choice,no chemistry at all between her and Alan Davies,her character just does not work,the stories are not as good either ,the best one from this season was taken off and put on the specials dvd,the only reson I give it three stars is Alan Davies as J C still if you like the show you might want to take a look."
2,What happened to the writing?,"Season 4 simply doesn't live up to the high standards of seasons 1, 2, and 3. The new female is introduced with insufficient storyline transition from Maddy's character in the earlier seasons. Further, the new female is a boring ditz who doesn't stitch the story elements together. Jonathan's interest in her ""endowments"" doesn't ring true. I miss Maddy's humorous personality defects that made her seem ""real."" Even without the annoying new blond, this season is a mess. In every episode, small potentially interesting subplots are introduced but never picked up again. It is as though the writers (or editors) had to fill in a few minutes, and did so with random bits that have NOTHING to do with the main or secondary plots."
5,Enjoyed all the Jonathan Creek series,"I like the light tone this series set. Not grim, funny at times, and a mystery to boot. Sorry it ended."
2,"Butcher's Dozen, Larry Wakefield","When people think of Michigan, they think of smooth drifts of snow, stretching beaches, and dense forests. Most people view it as a beautiful Place, However, theirs a side to it in which most haven't seen.Larry Wakefield's, The Butchers Dozen, is a portrayal of 13 of the most infamous, and gruesome murders that took place in Michigan, from 1830, to 1950. The book is arranged so that each chapter consists of a story. Each story focuses on an individual murder case, and their only story is only 10-15 pages. The stories are full very detailed descriptions of the murder, the trial, and sometimes, the unsolved-mystery.In reading this book. I was able to get a glimpse of how deranged, and realistic my home state has been in the past. Butchers Dozen kept my attention. I recommend this book for the reader who is interested in mysteries."
4,"Blood, Guts, And Death","Who knew that Michigan (outside of Detroit) could be so dangerous? The Butcher's Dozen by Larry Wakefield really opened my eyes to the danger that could occur close to home. This book is all about murders that happened all over the state. To be more specific, it's about 13 famous murders that happened in the late 1800's to the early 1900's.I really enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend the book to anyone to read. A word of advice is it the reader has a weak stomach not to read, because the book goes into great detail. Blood, guts, and death; you couldn't ask for a better book."
4,Butcher's Dozen,"First published in 1991 by Larry Wakefeild, he tells about the thirteen famous Michigan murders. I thought he did a very nice job writing the book because it allways cept my attention and made me want to keep reading to find out what was going to happen next. This book was a book with great detail, when I was reading a story about one of the murders it felt like I was standing right their watching it happen, for instance the bearded bandit story, when he shot the police officer at point blank range with a .44 caliber long barrel pistol, I could feel the gun going off and just picture the whole scene. If your a person that like's murder mystery's I would really incouage you to read the Butcher's Dozen, because thats all its about and after you read it you will agree that it is the best murder book you can find."
4,Butcher's Dozen,"First published in 1991, by Larry Wakefield, The Butcher's Dozen is about thirteen famous michigan murders. Each story is good. This book kept me interested and wanting to read. I feel reading about the history of michigan is fun. The book was fairly detailed and gave good background to the murders. The author also gave you a good insight on the murderer. It's surprising that these murders happened so close to where I live. I think everyone should read this book. It keeps you reading for sure. I recommend this book to everyone who likes reading about murders and short stories."
2,Dissapointing,"Having researched the life and work of Remedios Varo for nearly two years, I have found Janet Kaplan's book a must because she had an astonishing budget and support for having a fine printed book with excellent images and a fairly good biography of this artist. However, having read almost everything published on Varo, reading her own writings and kwnowing the world she lived her last ten years, I consider Kaplan book to be too far fetched on the personal interpretation she makes about Remedios Varo's life and work. Trying her best to make her preconceived ideas about Varo's paintings to fit in, this book is will easely fool those who doesn't know about surrealism, Mexico in the fifties and Remedios Varo."
4,"When the Rain comes, we run and hide our heads","This cd (which is a bootleg) brings back memories of the Rochester NY music scene in the late 1960s. Rain was a great band with a premier guitar player, Helmut Getto. I talked with Helmut a couple weeks ago and he said this is a definite pirated cd. But since this is the only digital copy I'll have to deal with it. And since it's a bootleg, I think I'll make all my friends copies of it. I'll even send Helmut one!"
3,Nice but costly,Bought this to use on arsenal of weapons to try works well but costly other products I've used works just as well with more product and less money would be better if they would at least triple the product for the same cost.
4,Good food that assures me my bird is getting proper food.,"I've always been pretty happy with Lafeber's foods, with the pellets being my bird's main staple and the berries serving as treats. Of course he does get occasional people food, fruits and veggies, cheese... but I feel more comfortable sticking predominantly with the parrot food.What really irks me though are the prices they advertise here. I am sure these MSRPs are flat out highly inflated prices. C'mon, List Price: $61.08?? There's no friggin way. Petco sells it for $19.99 in store, I buy it for $18.99 at my local bird store. I'm supposed to ""feel good"" that I'm saving $45.09 or 74%?? Ya might just be driving away customers like me using these tactics."
4,Birdie likes it!,"As the owner of a somewhat mentally unstable caique parrot I had reservations that he would actually eat this. Fortunately he definitely likes it and since it contains vitamins/minerals it's better for him than seed mix (it's a bad idea to feed your bird solely seed mix anyway). Each round ""berry"" is made up of seeds, corn and nuts, coated to retain its shape (it smells kind of like peanut butter to me!). If your bird doesn't like pellets (mine doesn't) give this a try.The only downside is that (with all bird food) some of it goes to waste - birds aren't into food conservation and drop food frequently! If the berries were a bit larger they would not fall through the cage bars (Mr Bird's cage has fairly wide bars at the bottom and half-eaten berries fall through)."
5,Nutri-Berries order,purchased Lafeber's Nutri-Berries Parrot Food. I was familiar with the product as my parrot has been eating these for the past 3 years. Product has become hard to find and has gone up in price some 30%. Amazon shipped it on time and for way less than the local pet stores. Look forward to making my next order.
5,Another great product,"For a bird mommy that has two very fussy birds this is a great product however, most of the time it's very expensive. I get it on Amazon.com not only cheaper but much faster."
5,Great product,My Cape parrot loves his nutri-berries for breakfast. I would recommend the product to anyone. Great quality and good price.
5,Biographies don't get any better than this.,"I admit to bias, because I was involved in the research for this book. Nevertheless, Linda Davis has achieved what any good biographer strives to do but few accomplish: she has brought her subject back to life. This is no small feat in the case of Stephen Crane, who has fundamentally eluded all previous biographers, including the poet John Berryman and the detailed but impossible-to-read Stallman. Crane led an adventure-filled life, and was a wonderful and colorful character, as well as a brilliant, pioneering writer. Linda Davis, too, is brilliant, as a biographer; and she's a fine, sometimes breathtakingly good writer. If you read only one biography this year, make it this one. (By the way, Davis was right about Crane being buried in Elizabeth, NJ; it WAS Elizabeth back then.)"
4,What Goes Around Long Waves Around,"Ah, what difference 18 years makes. It was pure hubris to call the date the way this author did. The ability to stagger along had more power than expected. But the long wave will not be denied, self destructive action of the financial ruling class will not cease, the inventiveness with which the financial gurus will distort the relationship between symbolic wealth and real goods and services is inevitable, in the end the guiding hand heads to the cliff, near to the edge, and finally over it. And then the climb back up commences until the lessons become unlearned. It's the raw market stupid...how much do you like it now?"
3,reader from Jersey,"Although his book taught the reader a great deal about the recruiting process, I found it too elementary to read, but I don't think that this is a horrible book. However, I would recommend it to any high schoolers in need of some assistance in getting into a good college and possibly recieving a scholarship. I would also recommend Athletic Scholarships: A Complete Guide."
3,Product description is misleading.,"I received my Motorola pink fashion pouch today and it is *not* leather as the item is advertised. The package indicated that it is PVC and it does have that fake leather look and feel. When I checked the Motorola website, nowhere in the description of that item does it indicate that it is leather. The case is decent and I like the color. The price is quite reasonable compared to other vendors, but if you're looking for a leather accessory, this is not leather."
3,Love the color....,"I'm not sure what the previous reviewers were talking about with the charger slots, etc....The case is functional - has holes for the charger and speaker sound, and protects the phone if dropped. There's also a wrist strap that you can weave through (a little difficult, but do-able) the phone so when it's not in the case, you minimize the probability that you'll drop it.The case is pleather and spray painted pink to match....I say spray painted because it smells like spray paint...I'm hoping the smell fades in time because like in the Seinfeld episode the odor gets transfered to the phone. Because of the smell, I'm rating this average - without the smell, I'd give it 4 stars.UPDATE: it took a month, but the smell finally disappeared."
2,This is not a case but a litttle bag.,"This is not a case, it is a bag. You have to take it out to answer the phone. The phone does not come out easily either. It is a cute little purse for the RAZR. It is useful only with the bluetooth headpiece."
2,I expected more.,"When I first got this case for my V3 Razr, it was kind of tight. It pressed the buttons on the sides, which caused my earpiece to think I wanted to make a call. That stopped after, it stretched out a bit. So, I thought everything was fine, then the metal connector on the strap broke. I only used the strap to keep the case from falling to the bottom of my purse, not much use, really. I have only had it for a week. Like I said I would have expected more from motorola. Unfortunately, I threw away the receipt."
3,Incorrect item,"I ordered three of these cases,for myself, friend and family. The problem with the design is that the opening for the recharger is NOT on the side but on the bottom which leads me to conclude that this particular design is NOT for the razr but for some other motorola phone. I like the design as do the other people who received the case. The problem is inherent in the design flaw. The pictures are definitely misleading. I ordered this product because it displayed the recharger opening on the side not the bottom. No telephone number or contact information is supplied to contact the manufacturer. So BUYER BEWARE!"
2,"Very cute, breaks easily, very tight fit, too tight","I bought this cute purse for my razr. The first time I walked out the door the nice metal hardware came undone and the strap failed on one side. Got a new one, the hardware seems to unscrew very easily. I would never trust this and do not recommend this. Its a shame it is very cute, but its a phone loser."
4,Decent quality.,I got this for my wife. She likes it. It's best to get one of the bluetooth headsets to go with it so you don't have to open the pouch and take out the phone every time you need to use it.(they sell a matching pink headset)One thing I don't like is having to take the phone out to be able to charge it. I'm thinking of making some adjustments myself but they really should have thought ahead.
4,THERE ARE 2 DIFFERENT POUCHES,"Motorola seems to have made 2 different versions of this pouch. I saw one at BestBuy and it had a hole on the bottom (where there is nothing on the razr phone) and I saw the same thing at Sam's club but it had a hole for the charger on the side, where it should be. The one I received had the hole on the wrong place but I kept it anyway... it fits the pink razr perfectly, its very cute, and durable... I love it. I gave it 4 stars just because of the charger whole... because you really don't know which one you are gonna get..."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"DO NOT BUY THIS CASE! It is NOT the right color, NOT leather, and NOT good! There is NOT a hole for the charger!! Every other case from a cellphone provider has a hole for the charger! YOU NEED A HOLE FOR THE CHARGER!! There is a hole in the back for the sounds. However, there is another hole randomly where there is NO charger...where there is on other phones. Also, there is no motorola symbols on the chain, like there usually is. This is NOT a case for the RAZR. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY! Spend the extra $7 and buy a REAL CASE FOR A RAZR PHONE!!"
4,Howling Good Fun,"I must admit that this is a good movie, despite the horrible make-up that Micheal J. Fox wears when he transforms into the ""wolf"". Why is it that every movie (and TV Show) that has a werewolf in it, the ""werewolf"" looks more like Bigfoot than an actual wolf? Hellsing is the only movie that I could think of that doesn't turn the werewolf into a Bigfoot rip-off.But Teen Wolf is a good movie about this basketball star that becomes a werewolf, and his father is too. I never saw the sequel to Teen Wolf, and from what I hear that's a very good thing. This is a movie from my childhood and it's very good, despite that Bigfoot make-up."
2,Beware of fine print,"When buying a product labeled ""new"" take care to read every single thing in the ad. If item has been opened to check for condition, that means the exterior could come all beat up and unfit to give as a gift. You will be stuck with it."
4,"""WICKED""","NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I WATCH THIS FILM , IT JUST GETS BETTER AND BETTER EACH TIME. ITS DEFINTLEY A TYPICAL 80es MOVIE BUT GIVES YOU THAT TINGLE DOWN THE BACK OF YOUR SPINE EVERYTIME YOU WATCH IT , AND THE ENDING IS A REAL FEEL GOOD END.ITS , FUNNY , COOL , EXCITING , AND DEFINTLY WORTH BUYING.SOON THIS MOVIE WILL NO LONGER BE AVALIABLE AND WILL ONE DAY BE WORTH SOME MONEY.""BELIVE ME, THIS IS COMING FROM A REAL LONDENER UK , NOT SOME SAD MOVIE BUFF!""GET IT AND YOUR LOVE IT"""
5,Great 80's flick!,"The first Teen Wolf was the best and the second was good too but not as good as the first one. Poor, Michael J. Fox didn't make it for Teen Wolf 2. When I first saw that movie it made me mad not to see Michael J. Fox. Jason is a great actor but I guess he felt a little bad for stealing Michael's role. It's great that it's coming on DVD I have been wanting it for along time. I have been searching every store I go to and I see Teen Wolf only for rent but not for sale but I'm glad that they are finally having it on DVD this year. I wouldn't say it's the best movie but it's one of my favorites. I hope they will release all the Back to the Future's on DVD soon because I think Michael J. Fox is my favorite actor. I guess the reason why he didn't do Teen Wolf 2 is because he was busy working on Secret of My Sucess. Because Teen Wolf 2 was made in 1987 and Secret of My Sucess was made the same year so I guess that's why. But I still think Teen Wolf 1 and 2 are great movies. CLASSIC!"
3,"Oh, the humanity!","My thoughts are plagued by the eternal mysteries of this magical film universe. Does being a ""Teen Wolf"" increase your height by five inches and guarantee basketball prowess? Or, conversely, does the mastery of said big-ball sport make one become a hairy high school ""King of the Court?"" Or, we could nix all this and get into the surfing. Oh, lonesome wolf of the teen variety, you prance upon the waves like a Neanderthal out of water...... except that you're on the van, i'm told."
1,This was a horrible movie!,"I love Fox, he's cute and a very good actor, so when this movie was on one day I decided to watch it. I was very disappointed! This movie is so bad, I couldn't even sit through the whole thing. Was this a spoof or something, was it supposed to be this bad? The idea of the film was of this kid who, when he gets emotional or worked up, turns into a werewolf ( and a bad one at that). Eventually it comes out that Fox is what he is and he becomes a superstar at his school, and a great basketball player too for some reason. He's now this popular hotshot who all the ladies want to go to bed with (in his other form, yuck!). It was so lame, and I'm sad to say I hated it. I shudder at the thought of a sequel, it sounds even worse!"
4,GIVE ME A KEG OF BEER!!!,"This movie is funny becaue of Jerry Levine. His character (Styles) is far and away the funniest thing about this movie. With repeated viewings, the movie as a whole isn't as interesting, but certain lines and scenes never stop being funny, and, for some reason, I like the ending too. Jerry Levine's agent should have parlayed Levine's role here into a comedy career for Levine, but that never happened. Michael J. Fox gives a typical performance, but it's affecting, and sincere. The basketball scenes are hysterical, particularly in light of his lack of height and basketball skills. The supporting cast is good, with Styles leading the way as top WOLF BUDDY. I recommend it for Levine's performance and a handful of great one liners. As far as the sequel goes, stick to reruns of The Hogan Family if you want to see Jason Bateman in the 80s-"
1,This book is written backwards...,...which makes it unreadable. The book uses notation and rules / theorems defined two-three chapters later if at all. That forces the reader to go back and forth to no end trying to collect information from subsequent chapters that would explain examples in the early chapters.
5,Never lose your pruner again,"Before I bought this I averaged one new pair of pruners every six months because I would misplace them. God only knows where they all went, I sure don't. In the last two years I have had the same rose pruner thanks to the sheath. Over my life this will pay for its self many times over."
3,Wouldn't buy it again.,"I bought this directory to get more information on the campgrounds,However it turns out its just alot of wasted pages that have marketing and advertising."
5,Great depiction of actual battles,I purchased this for my son's project on Pickett's Charge. The characters are really accuarate in weapons and positions. We painted the wall to resemble the stone wall and it was faily easy to display this part of the Battle of Gettysburt. It worked our great.
2,A Mixed Bag,"I and my son were very disappointed with this Civil War set. As the title says, it's a mixed-bag. The overall quality of the molds for the soldiers is ok. However, the quality of the accessories (buildings, cannons) is not.First, almost all the cannons and the caissons were broken - all the wheels are snapped off. Second, the ""buildings' which come with the set are not from the Civil War time period. They are all from WWII and one of them is 1:72 scale instead of 1:32 (the men tower over the building).They will get played with. Fortunately, you need some broken cannons to make a really good battle scene. As for the buildings...well...he has a thousand WWII soldiers as well - both 1:72 and 1:32 scale - so he'll survive.If you want a better set, then order the Irish Brigade."
2,gopisoma,"When I recieved this product half of the pieces were broken. Because I did not have time to return it, I was forced to use it."
2,:(,"These pieces were not so fun for my son. It is very ""cheap"" and the little things don't fit together properly or stand up like they are supposed to."
2,poor quality,"I didn't expect super high quality from this product though I expected more than what I got. My son was disappointed after spending his own money on this to receive it and many of the pieces already broken. Despite how cheap it is, he has fun playing with it."
3,Civil War Plastic Play Pieces,My Grandson is fascinated with the Civil War and loves playing with this set. It entertained him for hours. Small parts can break if handled too roughly. Great for creating one's own battles and manuevers.
4,Sub Par Quality But Fun,"The set arrived with a cannon axle already broken, but I expected that kind of thing from reading the reviews. My 9 year old son really wanted a toy soldier set that was Civil War themed and this set offered the greatest variety of pieces for the price. He really enjoys setting up battle scenes and plays with it endlessly. The figures themselves are of acceptable quality. The buildings are a joke. They look out of place and basically have to be taped to stay together.I think this is a good set for the price as long as you buy it for what it is and don't expect a high quality set."
2,"Good for diorama and play, but durability is TERRIBLE","This set was bought for a school project. As a side benefit, my son likes to play with the set. I can not recommend this set because of it's durability. With in the first day, these pieces have broken: tip of a gun, wagon wheels have fallen off and a horse's leg have broken in half."
2,so-so,"The blades are sharp and work well (one serrated and one smooth edge) and the handles are comfortable but these shears have a serious design flaw -- the locking mechanism (the little orange plastic rectangle in the picture) is supposed to slide down and grip the junction where the blades meet, thus locking them. Unfortunately, if you're pointing the shears downwards while cutting, it often slides down of it's own accord and locks the blades while you are trying to use them. You can remove the orange locking piece (it snaps on and off) but then you run the risk of losing it, forgetting where you put it, accidently stepping on it, etc. [...T]hese should have a more sophisticated and reliable locking device."
5,perfect for rag quilting,"the very best tool to use to complete the technique and look for the rag quilting seams,easy on wrist and perfect for avoiding the complications of repetitive motions associated with carpal tunnel syndrome. The spring action in the pruner works excellently when cutting thru several layers of fabric at a time,which in turn eases the human strengh to cut thru the fabric layers.the shears shape and size are a perfect fit for being in control of fabric and shears,I ordere three pairs."
5,wow,"Read it. Explore these words and you will see that in all your life she can set you free. also...I have had a quote in my head for some time...can anyone tell me if May Sarton wrote this?......she became for me an island of light, fun and wisdom, where I could run with my discoveries, torments and hopes and always find welcome..."
3,Nice but scent not strong enough,"While these are very nice, they dont have a very strong scent. I was hoping they would make my entire apartment smell good, but the scent seems to remain confined to a small area surrounding the candle. If someone doesnt want a super strong scent these would be great, but I need a bit more of a scent."
3,Only Half the Picture.,"This book gives an in-depth look at the follies of past governmental policies in India while tracing substantial changes in the nation's economic plans within the last ten years--allowing for the opening of markets and a competitive stance in the global arena by India. He outlines the failures of Nehru's idealistic approach, along with Mrs. Gandhi's autocratic regime. It also shows the potential for further opportunity with the change of the economic environment via globalization. It does have a few weaknesses--capitalism is exhorted as a panacea for India's dilemmas. And the image presented is overly rosy--the book only gives half of the picture and is unfounded in its optimism with regards to India's future via its current path. Abraham George's ""India Untouched: The Forgotten Face of Rural Poverty"" and P. Sainath's ""Everybody Loves A Good Drought"" are excellent counter-points to the issues presented in this volume."
5,Excellent book; must be read by every Indian,"Gurcharan Das has written an extrememly well-researched and objective book of the progress India has made in the last decade since the reforms of 1991. He lays out his thesis (that 80% of Indians will be at least at the middle class level by 2040) very clearly and backs it up with facts. Mr. Das also points out the areas in which India needs to improve to achieve Vision 2020 as laid out by President Kalam and Prime Minister Vajpayee. ""India Unbound"" is a must read for every Indian, alongwith ""Wings of Fire"" by APJ Abdul Kalam."
4,Interesting India History Lesson,The author explains the various governments of India and the implications each had on society and the next steps for the economy. Lots of detail that is lost on a non native that would likely make a native appreciate the book even more. Easy to read and interesting. Good primer on India for someone who has not read much on the country or its economy.
4,Growth Unlimited - India Unbound,"This book has become one of my favourite for two reasons. 1.) The author has written it in such an engrossing way(full of anecdotes) that you crave for more at the end of every chapter.2.) It talks about present India.This book does not give a picture (snake charmers, elephants, magicians, poverty...)which has been depicted for years. India Unbound traces meteoric rise of India after liberalisation and explores the reason behind it in Indian culture and tradition. It talks about deep rooted culture of Indian Business Community which has survived everything to see this day. I recommend India Unbound to everybody who wants to understand present Indian scenario. A must read for all."
3,Useful way to see knots,Haven't had a chance to refer to the knots much but it appears to be a useful form since it is plastic and the perfect size for a pocket.
5,perfect,Is exactly what I wanted. A fishing knot for tying a leder. I've never been taught how to do that. I don't like using the steel leders on a swivel. Now I can use this knot to fish without steel leders. Plus other good to know knots. And I can just keep this thing open and sitting out as a 12' ruler. Measuring panfish should be so much easier now when I rent a cheap 14' alumicraft and tool around the lake during this upcoming spring season. I can just keep this on the bench and it is completeley out of the way.
4,Good Guide,A good reference to remind you how to tie all the knots you thought you knew. A good refresher course.
5,Here are the 10 knots included,"I thought it would be helpful to you to know exactly WHAT 10 knots are included. They are: Perfection Loop, Dropper Loop, Surgeons End Loop, Nail Knot, Blood Knot, Improved Clinch knot, Palomar Knot, Uni Knot, Surgeon's Knot, and Double Uni-Knot. It also has some tips on knot basics.The instructions and diagrams are nice and large, so that you can see them without reading glasses. The three cards are connect together, plastic, waterproof, and extend together to make a 12"" inch ruler. The plastic is thin enough to be lightweight, heavy enough to be durable. Well worth the price, although I did get mine at a big discount store it was the same price as here."
3,NickRo in PA,"The Pros: this is a knot reference guide made of solid plastic cards witch are waterproof so it can be stored anywhere, tackle box, boat, vest, the drawings are clear and the knots cover all the basic, line to line, hook to line.The Cons: I should have read the reviews before purchasing, for the $4.95 price tag I expected a little more for the money. I guess if you have no idea of how to tie a knot it's a good guide."
4,Nice Reference Card!,I bought a couple of these for my wife's and my tackle boxes. They are made of sturdy plastic and seem like they should last a while. The instructions for the knots are easy to read. My only concern is the medal grommets that hold it together...I don't know if they will rust eventually if they get wet. I'm happy with these and actually going to order a couple more right now as gifts for people.
5,"Great single, great song","Come As You Are is one of the very first Nirvana songs I ever heard, and it remains one of my favorites, and definitely my favorite from the Nevermind album. The b-sides of this single are great too, awesome renditions of ""School"" and ""Drain You,"" live from the Paramount Theatre, without a doubt one of Nirvana's best shows. And if one chooses not to open the single, it's a nice piece of history to have in your collection."
2,Inconsistent,"This item gave me inconsistent readings within a matter of minutes. It first gave me a reading of 48% fat, then 19% fat, then 33% fat.. and the weight would go within a range of 13pounds. And I was on a flat surface. I had to return the scale."
1,Does not analyze body fat,"I bought this product and like the other reviewers, it gave me widely inconsistent readings just seconds apart. On top of that, I do not believe this product measures body fat at all (at least not entirely by the method it claims). It supposedly uses a current to test body composition, but if you change your height data in your profile, you see your Body Fat change proportionately. This should not happen if the reading is based on a ""harmless signal through the fat and muscle in your body,"" as the Instructional Manual claims. I cry chicanery. I'm taking mine back for a refund.Do not buy this product."
3,less than expected,I love the Chieftains But this is not what I expected. I have a lot of these cuts on other cd's and I was hoping for some newer stuff. Some live performances..... some off the wall songs oh well better luck next time.
5,Thank you!!!!!,"Do you have any idea how long I have been looking for a recording of ""I Know My Love?"" Try five years!! When I was in Ireland on tour in 2000, I heard that hauntingly beautiful love song and tried to find it over there. I can't believe that while I looked everywhere over in the UK, I am now finding it five years later, long after giving up, on the Internet! And what a beautiful interpretation it is too. I wouldn't have expected anything less from the mighty Cheiftains..."
3,Why did the chicken cross the road?,"Answer: To make an album with The Chieftains. Seriously, if you like collaborations, this is OK; but The Chieftains are best straight up!"
1,"Is it over? [... ""Well over""]??","Tedious. Trite. Blasphemous.I know it's ""just"" music, but I feel abused by this effort.If you're a fan of The Chieftains you don't need to own or hear this CD. You already own the best cuts and the other thirteen or sixteen are just pitiful grabs for the limelight that it seems they feel they're missing!If you're not a fan of ""The Chieftains"", you won't become one because you listened to this collection.Really! Ziggy Marley!?!?! My 19-year-old daughter and her friend were in stitches, laughing at that collaboration. Others are equally moronic.The Chieftains don't have to play back-up to every act!What next? Accompanying Christina Aguilera as she sings ""Danny Boy""????Nothing is forever. Forty years is a long time. If The Chieftains have recorded all that they need to record, then don't record!!! However, I will be the first in line to buy tickets when them come to Pittsburgh. (Unless they feature Michael Jackson...)[Nothing against Michael Jackson!]"
3,They just did it for the money?,"This album comes across as so phony. I could not BELIEVE what I was hearing. Complete with the currently popular ""mystical"" effects from Riverdance, it dumbs down this great traditional music and reduces it to the most obvious devices to pull audience strings. (And I love the Riverdance album! Just, not what they did in here!) I was shocked to hear such superb musicians as Sinead, Ricky and others doing such unabashedly CHEESY renditions of this great, original, rich music. The vibrant tapestry one associates with the Chieftans is completely absent."
5,Blown Away,"After listening to this CD, I was simply blown away by the quality and range of music. This is my first Chieftains CD (just heard about them) and am simply amazed by the quailty of the songs and the performances. The CD is a keeper."
4,Different,Really liked all the different artists singing with the Chieftains. Wide range of music. Really enjoyed it.
2,Typical conspiracy nut,"Let me say that I am very familiar with Alex Jones and what he preaches. There are many times when I agree with Jones..... mainly on border security, Patriot Act, National ID cards, and certain elements of Big Brother. That said, I also feel Alex Jones is just another conspiracy theorist who has few facts to back his claims.There is not a single theory out there that proves the U.S. Government was involved in the 9/11 attacks. Jones uses phrases like ""it's admitted"" and ""it's a fact"" when there is no evidence. I don't doubt that the Feds had prior knowledge, and most everyone with an IQ over 20 knows Bush and his minions are complete liars, but there is no evidence the government actively engaged in the attacks.This book is almost verbatim to Jones' film 9/11 The Road to Tyranny, which in parts is very well done, but mostly total crap. If you've seen 911/TRTT there is no need to buy this book."
1,Not supported by facts or logic.,"It is a sad sign of the times that so many people have apparently swallowed Alex Jones's ramblings and disconnected assertions hook, line and sinker."
1,Amazon should change photo,"I agree with one of the two reviews, this is not what is depicted in the photo. The main mount is not included, which is shown. This is just a bushings kit."
1,Monroe 901940 Strut-Mate Mounting Kit,"Item arrived with washers, nuts, everything pictured except the actual strut mount (the main black piece pictured)."
5,When You Seek You Shall Find,"OE approved parts by Chrysler, which fix my Plymouth Breeze just right. By doing your research before letting an Auto Repair Shop overcharge you for the same parts you can get at a discount price means more money in your pockets. FYI limited income means exactly that LIMITED!"
3,It was Joe Johnstons fault!,"A good narrative from JB Hood but lets face it..There was no excuses for the Hood ordered frontal suicide attack at Franklin! Most of his subordinate commanders including the great Patrick Cleburne himself advised against it. As the previous reviewer pointed out, most of Hood's book is in answer to post war charges from Joe Johnston in his own book. Hood himself stated that he felt the AOT was weak in the fact that they had become accustomed to the defense of breastworks. Take a look at the losses to the AOT in Atlanta as Hood orders them out of their own defensive breast works to attack Sherman's forces. Atlanta fell. It just got worse in Tennessee. Hood's glory days were in the east in the ANV as a brigade commander. It's a good a read and I recommend. Howevere don't assume because Hood was there, this book the final word."
5,I'm a real person and this is a real review,"Hello everyone, I just wanted to let you know that I am a real person and this is a real review. I have been using this little facial flex device twice daily for about a month and a half and OMG I can totally see a DIFFERENCE! I am almost 33 and I was beginning to notice facial sagging in my cheeks (the very beginning of jowls). I bought the Carol Maggio exercise DVD (which is great, but totally time consuming) and was looking for something else that took less time to do each day! I stumbled upon this product, read the reviews and decided to give it a try. I am totally noticing tone in my face...especially around the mouth and jaw line. It's amazing. Honestly, everyone should get this mouth piece. I do 200 exercises a day morning and night... right after I brush my teeth. It's convenient and it works. Get it."
3,Do not use if you have a TMJ disorder,"I tried this for one day and I think it probably works as it should. However, I have a pretty bad TMJ injury from a car wreck that no longer really bothers me. But after using this, my TMJs hurt for four days later, which triggered a bad headache. So do not buy if you have any kind of TMJ problem as it really works those joints, which I am not so sure is anatomically good for anyone if it hurt me this much. At least it does not seem to cause the joints to pop or grind."
5,Starting early,"I'm 27 and I'm starting my preventative beauty regime as early as I can! A stitch in time as the saying goes...!Anyways, it's a simple product to use, but I felt that the 6oz and 8oz bands weren't doing enough for me (it felt too easy and I couldn't feel adequate tension, maybe it is because I'm younger and my face muscles are firmer, I don't know...) so I got some 14oz bands off of eBay for supercheap and have been using them since!Very happy with the product and the results so far and I can highly recommend this product to anyone thinking of trying it out! :D"
4,It fixed my smile,"As a gym buff, I knew that my face also needed ""resistance training"" if I were to keep it firm. After using the product for about a week, I noticed that my smile was more symmetrical (for some reason, the left corner of my mouth at times didn't always rise equally with the right). My cheeks also looked fuller. It's still a challenge to use the product correctly but I'm making facial flex a part of my regimen."
3,Works but new unit breaks easily,"I bought this product years ago and used it faithfully for a few weeks. i definitely noticed a difference, it did work at lifting my cheeks. However, this year (when I really needed it) I bought it from Amazon, and the piece broke within 1 week. They appeared to have changed manufacturing and now make it much cheaper. Will order again shortly but its gone up about 20.00 per unit and I cant believe it broke so easily. All I was doing was putting it back in its case, and the plastic just snapped in half. the technology behind this absolutely works to exercise the face. They just need to go back to whoever made it previously it used to be a much better product."
4,Facial Flex,"Check out this link:[...]I haven't tried this yet, but I'm currently looking at various facial devices for at home use. This one is way cheaper at QVC. Seems to be the same thing!"
2,Overpriced for uncertain results,"This product was recently seen on TV for $20 less than I paid. Not sure it is engaging the muscles described in graphics, even after careful reading of directions. My bad. Disappointed."
5,A Trip Down Memory Lane,"Looking at this book now in the age of PC, I can see how some people could find some of the content offensive. But they have to realize that this captures folklore that wasn't considered offensive at the time. The book has some really funny jokes and games from childhood...remember making fortune tellers, jacobs ladders, cats cradle? Ooh, and the: ""My mom will kill me if she heard me tell one single dead baby joke"".I first purchased this book in 1988 to have on hand when my neices and nephew's visited me. I then lent it to a few people through out the years, I recently had to replace it because my children just plain wore the book out."
1,Warning: inappropriate content for children,"We had ordered these books as part of a Cub Scout project on American folktales. You can imagine our dismay when we opened up the books and discovered that they contained content that is highly inappropriate to any teaching environment relating to children. Sexually inappropriate jokes and racial/ethnic jokes are contained in this book. As a scholarly treatise, there may be some justification in including them (although no scholarly discussion on the inappropriate content can be found), but please be aware that the material is certainly not suitable for children under 16."
2,Not great for group studies,"I purchased the book and the study guide to do a group study of the book.Most of the study questions are more like quiz questions that check to make sure you actually read the book. The questions don't even try to lead into deeper discussion.I used the study guide to write my own questions. It helped a little bit in that regard, and the only other help it was, is that it has key Bible verses that relate to the chapter (most of the time)."
2,Cliff's Notes version of book,"Due to one person's suggestion (who never showed up for the study), our book study/dinner group voted we study the accompanying book. SO having struggled to read it years ago, I bought ***ALL*** of Foster's works, including the Audible versions, study guides, journal, leaders guides, etc just so that I might find the right catalyst to pentrate my thick gray matter. Being a late-comer to Christianity, I guess I'm etherally challenged...but I can say that the entire group (except for our ONE cerebrally-blessed, former New Age guru)will be so glad when we can move on to Richard Rohr...or someone who writes about things we less churched people can understand. This is not for spiritual novices...so I was grateful for this Cliff's Notes version."
1,Terrible design,"To insert the soap and batteries in this dispenser, you have to take the back of Hello Kitty's head off. This means removing two screws, each of which is located almost two inches inside a tiny tunnel. After you find the right screwdriver (hint: it helps if your husband makes model trains and has a lot of microscopic tools), you find that whoever tightened the screws did not intend them to be removed - and was muscular enough to make sure they weren't. The design makes it impossible to get any real leverage, the screws are getting stripped, and you're worrying that you're abusing your husband's tools. End of story: This item is now an overpriced decoration/dish on my granddaughter's dresser, and we're getting her a conventional-design soap dispenser (i.e., one that works)."
1,Awful purchase,"I attempted to purchase a McLaren stroller. I receieved accessories, not the actual stroller. I was very dissapointed. The seller was awful and refused to send me the correct product. Amazon was wonderful and refunded my money. Sadly I did not receive the stroller, so I am unable to rate the actual product."
3,Poor auto-focus,"The camera size, style, and docking station are excellent. However, the auto-focus is very poor. I have used this camera for two months and almost 30% of the pictures that I have taken are out-of-focus. I finally got to the point of taking at least 3 to 5 pictures of the same subject hoping to end up with one good quality image. It seems to me that the compact size has sacrified the camera's focusing system. In addition, the built in flash is very weak."
5,I love my Canon SD30,"I bought and got this camera from Amazon, about 2-3weeks now. And I have to admit it I LOVE my Canon. Its light and not too small and not too huge. Everyone has been complimenting on what a beautiful camera it is. It comes with a nice leather case that even my friends have envied. They all say 'wow' its like the size of my phone. I use a 512 MB SD card, and i take so many pictures. This is a great camera for someone's first digital camera. I dont consider to be a professional camera, this is more for family and friends taking pictures camera. So yea i love it. Canon you rock."
2,Great camera if you don't like taking pictures!,"Sure my Canon sd-30 is super cute and I get lots of compliments on how small and sexy it is, but heaven forbid you want to take pictures with it!!This camera cannot take pictures in low light AT ALL! Every picture I've taken at parties has been out of focus, which adds up to a lot of hazy photos of great memories. I took it back to the camera shop and the guy said I had the setting right but ""yeah, they don't work well in low light."" Well if I needed a bright sunny day for every shot I could make a pinhole camera out of a cardboard box!The pictures it takes in daylight are nice. But anyone who wants a tiny little camera like this is planning on putting it in their pocket and taking it to parties!I got the Sony Cybershot 10.1 and it takes GREAT pictures in low light. Later, Canon."
5,THE BEST!!,i love this camera!! i looked and a billion cameras i wanted on affodabl and small. and this was exactly it!! i love it so much its the best. it takes good day and night pictures. its even good for kids.i recomend this camera for every age and size!!
1,Canon Accessory Support,Camera itself is okay but be very careful buying this camera as the power cord adaptor for this product is discontinued and no longer supported by CANON.
3,A long-time friend,"I have had the PowerShot SD30 for over 3 years now and it has served me well. It is still up and running with a few minor problems. Sometimes the shutter won't completely open or close. I just give it a nudge and it goes into place, but it is still inconvenient. The buttons on the back are sticking and it's difficult to scan through pictures without accidentally pressing another button (and I have tiny fingers). But after three long years of being dragged around everywhere in my purse, this little guy has stood up very well.The picture quality isn't as great as I wish it could have been. Indoor pictures in dim lighting are terrible, and sometimes you have to hold down the button for a very long time before the flash will even go off. When you want to catch something in the moment, you probably won't, and it's pretty hard to hold a not-so-fake smile for that amount of time.This camera is durable and lasting in structure, but not so much in picture quality."
4,digital camera,"Works fine, appreciate the small size. A plethora of shooting options can make it seem too complex, but you can set it up where it just becomes a point and shoot camera. I purchased this for my wife for Christmas so that she could have a small item that fits in her purse without taking up a lot of room. I fills the bill."
5,The BEST camera ever,"Works so well, takes great pictures. So glad to have gotten it for a GREAT price!"
1,not work,"unfortunately, does not work when I tried it emits sound and error 18, is the lens out and unresponsive.that bad product."
4,~Large for Small Hands **Good Quality & Reasonable Price**,"My experience with the Fiskars 7936 PowerGear Pruner has been very positive based on the price paid and performance.I've had mine for 5 years and they are still going strong. Blade is substantial and I sharpen it regularly. No rust or anything that interferes with smooth cutting and good leverage. I do maintain my tools, but I own another Fiskars pruner model [9275] that is nowhere near the quality and durability that I've appreciated with the 7936 PowerGear.My hands are small - as in short; they are strong compared to a lot of women's hands, but they are small (I say stubby, my Man says they're ""cute""). Anyway, when I do more than 90 minutes of pruning with this PowerGear model, the muscles in my hand start to cramp. So I got a completely different style (Felco F-2)that is a better fit for those pruning marathon days. I still use this PowerGear model the most.The Fiskars 7936 PowerGear Pruner is well-made, affordable, and durable."
2,Not comfortable holding,It's not sharp and not stable holding. it always slips when I cut or trim the branches. I feel very dangerous holding it all the time.
2,DON'T BUY IF YOU ARE LEFT-HANDED!!,"The action seems fairly smooth, but it does NOT work for the left hand, since the action rotates. If you are lefty, DON'T BUY THIS - it will be anti-ergonomic. I generally like Fiskars products, but wish there had been more information (didn't see anything on the package or on the description) about the handedness."
2,Hugely Disappointed,"The grip is too large and clumsy to work with. Also, after very little use, when I spueeze to cut something, the clippers stay shut.I really would like to send them back but have thrown away the receipt and packaging as I though they were going to become my all time favorite clippers. Very disappointed."
2,Too much plastic.,"I was developing RMIs and was branching out. The pruner fits well (enough) in the hand. I think the gear makes detectable(?)difference, however; much too often when making cuts at angles ...especially the larger branches (~1/2""), the clippers again and agan failed to make clean cuts: leaving nagging attachements requiring all sorts of attention. This was too annoying to make them an asset. I tested the clean-angled cuts with both felcos and bahcos: both made cleaner cuts. I'm a HEAVY user/cutter; not a home-garden, light-use, person."
3,"worked great for 3 years - then, it broke","I used these pruners for 3 years, and they worked well. This spring I was cutting up branches into smaller lengths, and they broke as I was using them. I need to see if the warranty will cover that."
1,Biggest piece of junk,"OMG, this was the sorriest piece of gardening equipment I ever purchased. I thought the Fiscars garden knife was a bad purchase but this beat the knife. At least I still have the knife (see my review for it.) I used the pruner three times and by the 4th time it completely fell apart. The plastic lock fell off. There was a screw opposite the lock that basically disassembled itself when I used it and fell into the grass never to be seen again. You would think I had cut a tree limb with it. I was pruning my roses and it just fell apart. Well into the trash it went. I thought Fiscars was a reliable company. They should just stick with scissors and forget about manufacturing junk garden equipment. Sad. Reeeeeal sad. H."
2,Not for the lefties,This item is very uncomfortable for me to use. I am left handed and the device feels odd in my hand. I can't get the correct leverage because the hand grip rotates the wrong direction. It is made for a right hander not the opposite.
2,"Worked 2 years, then hinge broke","After 2 years of regular use, the orange plastic in the hinge and gear crumbled and the tool fell apart."
2,Not for left-handed gardeners,"I have always been impressed with the high quality of all the Fiskar tools that I have used over the years, but this one is not for us that are left-handed. It cuts very well, but it has accidentally locked while I'm pruning, and unlocked accidentally. The annoying blade locking design engages too often when I'm cutting flowers or trimming plants. I am also critical of the way the handles awkwardly move when pruning. I'm confident that it's a very well made pruner, but is poorly designed."
5,I love these,My daughter bought a pair from costco and I had to have a pair for myself. They are great! Very easy to use.
2,Northwest Blackberry Pruning,"The 7936 powergear pruner broke down the first time I used it on Northwest Blackberry Bushes. After cutting two stalks, the device began to stick closed each time I used it. Sorry."
4,"Makes a Good, Clean Cut",My principal interest in hand pruners is a good clean cut. The Fiskars 7936 does this job well. No mashing or fraying and it makes square and angled cuts with equal ease.
3,Leftporium needed,"Appeared to be a comfortable and sleek design when purchased.However, hope you are right handed! The design with ""easy""grip (rotating handle to ease fatigue) only works for righties.Good luck. My sister ended up with mine."
3,does this for a living,"blades gum up easily after repetitive use. Need to keep spraying lubricant to keep blades from gumming up. Corona Professional bypass pruners are a bit more resistant to gumming. Otherwise, an excellent pruner. Love the teflon coated blades because it doesnt rust and is easy to clean."
2,A good idea.....,The handle that rotates with your grip is a great idea....it really did help make things more ergonomic. The problem is that the rotating handle is held in place in the pruner by a plastic peg sliding in a plastic slot. It became worn down within 2 months so that the rotating handle just dropped out of the pruner at will....usually when up on a ladder!
5,Best hand pruners I've ever owned,"I've bought five of these now, so I can claim I put my money where my mouth is. I bought one years ago, when an extended pruning session with conventional pruners was aggravating a tendon problem. The way the lower handle rotates with the natural curling action of my fingers is ingenious, and really does let me cut bigger and harder stuff than I really ought to, without the problems I used to have. I quickly got a second one so my wife and I didn't wind up trading it back and forth if we were doing yardwork together. She has very small hands, and the extra leverage really helps her. Then I replaced one that got left over at the inlaws so we didn't have to use their old junk. With my luck, the next time I want to buy one I'll find the model has been replaced with something I don't like as well, so I just ordered two more to sock away. The few negative reviews really astonish me -- we've had many Fiskars products and they're uniformly excellent."
4,good unit,The use of this cutter is versitle. For most male patrons they aare easy to use and do the job. For some women this may not be the best as their hands are smaller and their strength is not the same an a man's. But on almost every cut both will enjoy thest cutters.
3,Not sturdy,"I bought these and used them half an hour (cutting oak twigs up to half an inch thick) before the spring that recloses the grip broke, requiring me to manually reopen the pruners after every cut. They also squeaked. Was fine when it worked, but didn't work long."
1,Horrible Book.,"Beats around the bush. Very wordy. Extremely politically bias. No answers in back of book for problems. This book does not teach what is, but what should be. Normative Economics at its worst."
2,Cute but not practical,"This toaster is so adorable but it's really not worth the trouble. The bread takes a while to toast and when it's finished, Hello Kitty's head is barely visible. The only way to get her to show up would be by actually burning the bread. Opt for the waffle or sandwich maker instead--they're so much better!"
3,Misleading picture.,"My daughter saw this item and was very excited about having the Hello Kitty design on her toast, so we ordered it as a gift for her. Unfortunately, the only way to get the design on the toast is to set it fairly high (around 6 or 7). The design almost never shows up on bagels, even though there is a button specifically to use for bagels. Bottom line is that it's a cute toaster for those who like Hello Kitty, but don't expect the toast to look like the picture very often."
2,misleading,"I bought this as a present for my sister-in-law, when I asked her if the toast comes out as hello kitty she said no it doesn't, she says you have to turn the dial way up even to see anything.Poor product please don't waste your money."
4,Good Kitty,I gave it as a gift to my daughter who loves Hello Kitty. We would buy it again if we need one. Thanks
3,It's okay...,"I got this toaster as a gift for christmas. It does toast things, but if you are looking for a toaster that burns hello kittys face on toast, dont get this. To get her face you have to burn the toast, and her face looks distorted.But I like it."
5,super cool,I bought it for my sister for Christmas . She loved it. It is super cool. Not at all heavy. And makes cute pictures of hello on the toast.
4,Cutest Toaster!,"This little toaster is very cute and works very well. I love the unique design. It is a very nice added touch to my country kitchen. The toast does not come out with as clear a kitty print as shown in picutre. That is why I did not give a 5 star rating. I purchased it more for the cute design, wide toaster slots, and all of the settings."
4,Hello Kitty toaster review,The product was delivered promptly was just as great as it looked online. The toaster has many settings which I wasn't expecting from a novelty item like this. I would highly recommend this product to any Hello Kitty fan. I got this for my Fiance and she absolutely loved it.
1,"Disappointing, doesn't work as advertised, but it's a cute idea","It doesn't toast bread very well on any setting, and the Kitty face on the toast is barely visible, unlike the picture in the ad, which I suspect was enhanced. Unlike the advertising image, which shows a clear, detailed Kitty-chan on the bread with eyes and a bow; the real thing is more like a vague round white blob of un-toasted bread, no eyes or other details. Great design, though. This would be a charming product if it actually worked as advertised."
5,Top of the line,I thought I'd be receiving a cheapy plastic looking toaster that makes a ghostly shadow in the toast when in fact!..........This toaster is plastic but so Cute because its the Kitty of course And it has all the bells and whistles that a nice toaster should have. I have even toasted hamburger buns on bagel mode so the soft part stays soft and the inside of the bun gets toasted and has a fabulous face of Hello Kitty. My three girls just love this!I am very much looking forward to using this to make little party finger sandwiches for my daughters birthday party.You have to have the selector switch above 2.5 though to get a god face imprint but to soften the slices back up you wrap them in a little thin paper towel and put in a Baggie to cool for a good few minutes. They'll be perfect!
2,Toast does not work so well,Can't really see Hello Kitty's face after toasting. It does not come out very clear. Not worth the high price.
3,Not bad,"Well the face does not come out that well on the bread but what can you do, my wife still got a kick out of it.."
5,great fun,"The ""Hello Kitty"" was for a friend would loves all things ""Hello Kitty"" but had not seen this item. She loved it. By the way she is 26 and just graduated with honors from college."
2,Ok,"Toaster, cute. But I have to toast the bread to a near burnt condition to really see the image. The description should also mention that the toaster uses 115V plug as in my country its 240v so I need to spend another 30USD to get a 1000W converter. :("
4,Cute and toasty!,The look of the toaster really adds something to my kitchen and I've never enjoyed making toast as much as I do now but unfortunately the hello kitty face does not come out as well as I would have hoped.
4,Cute but not Wholly Functional,"IMPORTANT UPDATE: Set the toaster to number ""2"", and toast the bread twice. Not only does the face show up, it also doesn't burn the toast!! Watch out for the smoke detector though- I used this in my dorm and it went off for 10 seconds.Cute adorable toaster! It works well but unfortunately the kitty face doesn't show up for me unless I practically burn the toast. Also, anyone else get a weird melted plastic smell? I've isolated the machine from any source of plastic and almost took it apart to find the source of the smell. Still smells like melted plastic when I use it. This can be carcinogenic. A little concerned."
1,Out of order!,"I was really excited and tried to use it as soon as I got this. But when I used it, the lever won't stay down and I could not use it! I thought burning Hello Kitty face on the toasts is so cute, but actually, once you get this, you have to return it. It is very stressful. There are many different toasters, so you should not buy this."
5,Great seller,Very cute toaster. Purchased as a gift for my niece going off to college so don't really know ho well it works but seemed to be built well and has great features. The seller was great. Shipped fast.
3,hello kitty toaster,"i really like this toaster it is so cute! But im dissapointed, the kitty imprint didnt work :("
3,Hello Kitty Blob,"I have never tried this toaster with white bread, I'm amusing that's what it was meant for, but with the bread I use, the toast comes out with a vaguely Hello Kitty shaped blob. Very disappointing. Also, if you don't toast it long enough, hello kitty's face is just raw bread in the middle of the rest of the toast.I guess it's still the cutest toaster ever, but I wish I'd known about this before I bought it, oh well."
2,Bread came out wierd and not very tasty,"I got this for my friends birthday a few years ago when it was still $30 on the Sanrio website (no clue what happened to it in the end since she lost a lot of stuff when she was booted out of her dorm). We tried it out and expected an uber cute kitty on our toast for breakfast, and instead got an odd half kitty face. The bread was burnt in some places around the edge and the white part was barely warm. Not a very good breakfast. It became a simple conversation piece since the regular toaster (half the price of this one) was much more reliable. Even if they did lower the price, it's still not worth it to me!"
2,Hello Kitty vs Choco Cat,"Sure, it looks cute, and has a handy reheat button for whenever your toast is stale after chasing the kids around - BUT you may have trouble getting a decent Hello Kitty face on your toast - unless you like yours the color of Choco Cat."
3,THE ATTIC,"I GOT THIS MOVIE BECAUSE I THOUGHT I SAW IT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.THE MOVIE IS OLD,SLOW GOING FOR MOST OF THE MOVIE.I GUESS IF YOU WHAT TO SEE HOW UNBELIEVABLY BAD A FATHER CAN BE TO A DAUGHTER,YOU'LL WHAT TO SEE IT.IT HAD SOME INTERSTING PARTS.I GUESS YOU COULD SAY IT HAD A STUNNING ENDING.IF YOU CAN GET IT CHEAP, IT'S WORTH A LOOK."
5,An essential reference!,"I happened on this book in my public library and I now need to own it! It is simply crammed with very clear instructions and photographs on all aspects of cross stitch. My favorite thing about this book is that it helps you go beyond just counted cross stitch in other counted thread techniques. She doesn't have the space to go into detail about these other techniques (Hardanger, drawn thread, etc), but enough information is given to let you choose if you want more details.This book is also simply well-written. While it is meant to be a reference book, I have been known to simly sit down and read it from cover to cover."
5,A super resource for small cross stitch flowers,"I saw this book at the library. It had more information than I wanted to just get occasionally and I went home, went to Amazon and put in the ISBN. Presto! The book was here in 4 days. Lots of specifics about different stitches and lots of tiny cross stitched flowers that I can use on labels for my quilts. I use this a lot."
3,The Cross Stitchers' Bible.,This book is just so-so. It has some helpful information that is useful to the beginner. But I must say there is just something lacking. Please don't get it for the patterns as there isn't many there or anything that you would probably do.
4,After playing EQ for 5 years...,"If you're still playing EQ, and don't have all the expansions, then get this.The Anniversary Edition includes the latest expansion, The Buried Sea (TBS). TBS was released about 2 months before this was, and for $30. This angered many, but IMO you get much more out of new expansions when you play them right as they come out. You explore the new content with everyone else at the same time, and loot is generally easier to get until they nerf item drops 2 weeks after the new expansion.You'll need PoR to get auras, and The Serpent Spine to play the new race of Drakkins or to do mid-level quests for so-so gear. Bits and pieces of essential features come with each EQ expansions. E.g.: Guild Hall: DON; Magus for traveling: LDON; Monster Missions: DODH; Dain MM: PoR.I once quit my job and another time dropped out of school to play EQ fulltime, so I'm a dedicated player, but presently I'm out of the game. When I come back I will certainly buy this."
3,Too demanding,"this game is fun, if you have the time. Even then... it mostly feels like work, out of all the mmo's, this one has the most Grind. This game is fun if your ok staying with mid - mediocre equipment, but to get the usefull equipment its just too demanding."
1,Look elsewhere,"If you've played or are currently playing WoW and are looking to see what else is out there in that genre.... Don't bother. There's nothing else out there that compare. Neither this version nor EQ2 are worth the money. If you still want to try it, download the free trial version. Don't spend anymore money than you have to on it. You'll understand once you see the poor quality of graphics and game play."
3,Everquest,"Everquest I: The Anniversary EditionGood overall game, lot of high end players. lower levels kinda slow. The MMO that made things big."
4,One of the best MMORPGs ever and father of them all.,"If you want an adult, challenging, difficult, intelligent game with a friendly player basis and a very consistent world complete with cultures, languages and factions (yes all that WoW is not) definitely try out Everquest or Vanguard.The races/classes are excellent, many quests are difficult, well thought out and take time.So actually exactly the opposite of a game which is easy, rewards come without risk and without work, intelligence and maturity are an option and world's consistence is irrelevant. EQ is everything that WoW (and its clones like SWTOR) is not and EQ is not what WoW&clones; is.We are 2012 today so that EQ is many expansions farther. However the best EQ experience is on Time Progression Servers that restarted at the original EQ 1999 period. Enjoy what is probably the best MMORPG ever."
2,Past its prime,Good price but it is just an attempt to bring back vets who are curious to see how the franchise has faired over the years. I played this game up to the Omens of War expansion and it stills screams as a first generation mmorpg.The bottom line is most people who are either coming from a title like World of Warcraft will not be pleased. If you used to play EQ and want to give it another try you probably will be throwing away your 20 bucks. The game just can't compete by today's standards. I've had more fun playing the myriad of free mmorpgs that are popping up like weeds lately. This is the mmorpg that interns are getting experience on it seems before moving on to the better projects.
5,Wonderful finesse!,"I can understand why others rate this so low, as they truly do not appreciate the finer qualities of classical piano. Anyone with a pre conceived notion that anything by Rick Wakeman should knock your socks off are doing themselves a great disservice.Wakeman's arrangements and performances of 10 classical piano pieces are quite as good as they can get. It gives a different twist on these great classics. The Pathetique portion for example, it is as good as, or dare I say better than any others I have heard, and we have at least 10 different versions of this at home, so by comparison Wakeman ranks right up there with the best classical pianists.Wakeman's execution is charged with subtle heart felt emotion and a very pleasant and satisfying hour's worth of listening. I can honestly recommend this to anyone who truly enjoys beautiful piano music. Everyone I know who has heard this CD, at home or in the office, has said it is beautiful to listen to."
2,A great opportunity missed?,"Most people acquainted with Rick Wakeman's more substantive works are surely clearly aware of his versatility and skill. However, one wonders whether that is truly enough when attempting to elaborate on pieces of previous maestros...I will repeat a mantra that I use for Rick Wakeman more often than I would like to: YOU COULD HAVE DONE MUCH MORE WITH THIS! Rick, this was too easy for you and that is precisely my reproach. This could have been an opportunity for growth, for new insight. When you perform variations, you will inevitably be compared to those who have gone before you.Despite the lack of growth this plateau-like album expresses, the piano playing is still pretty in typical Wakeman style, but unfortunately there is not much else."
1,Yikes! is this for real?,"I never got to see any of the ""Thief in the Night"" series but heard them talked about in Sunday School classes. Finally a few years ago I found this one at a video store. The best I can say is that it makes the simple minded ""Left Behind"" books credible by comparison. Bad theology, bad acting, bad writing...it is worth a hoot to watch it once, but it lacks even the baroque weirdness of a Jack Chick tract...simply baaaaad. Gotta love that ""Mark of the Beast"" though. Also all of the silly and dated computer jargon...the scriptwriter must have just completed a course in ""Introduction to Data Processing""."
5,learning to read,"My 6 year old daughter has brought this book home several times. Reading it gives her a great sense of accomplishment, and it's a bit different than the standard repetitive books used for emerging readers. I enjoy the lovely illustrations and don't mind hearing it over (and over...) again. I plan on purchasing a copy and keeping it with some of my very favorite children's books."
4,"Weeping Willow, Good Read, Great Writing","This book is surprisingly a very good one and well-written. The main character is one who you will root for her to overcome the sad obstacles in her life because of a mean stepfather. The pages are just enough in the book, It's not a very short story and not overly long and drawn-out."
5,Bamboo Flutes and French Horn Solos,"Hidden Landscapes is an original collection of Hunt`s Compositions including classical,world and contemporary styles featuring his hand crafted bamboo flutes,French horn and keyboard. The music leads the listener into an exiting magical journey of the imagination."
4,Excellent stitch guide -- misleading cover,"I agree with other reviewers -- this book is a very concise reference for dozen of stitches, and the photography of each stitch, step-by-step, is superior to many of the other handbooks available (and far less confusing than an illustration).I am disappointed that the many beautiful projects shown on the cover and inside the book are never addressed further -- there are no patterns, no diagrams of those projects. Even the photographs of many of the projects are so small, that it's difficult to see the detail in the stitch work (and thus, pattern it out for yourself). A good addition to the reference section of a stitcher's library, and a nice source for project inspiration, but not a source for patterns."
5,Great instructions.,I am a beginner embroiderer and can barely stitch a straight stitch. The instructions are easy to follow. The visual photos help especially since I am left handed and the photos displayed are for right handed people.
3,the embroiders handbook,"The book is very well presented. It is a very nice looking book, and has lots of good information in it."
3,Sorry. The RATING was DECEPTIVE!! It was WORSE than G.,"Because I belong to a Buffalo Soldiers group, I was excited to find this movie. As a teacher, I would like to have shown it to students. BUT, I WILL NOT!! It was way to GORY which DETRACTED from the MESSAGE of the HONOR that should have been given to the brave soldiers and the MISSION of the BUFFALO SOLDIERS in this country.Is there any way that the RATING can be CHANGED to reflect REALITY?"
1,Worst Movie Ever!,"Danny Glover stole this idea from me, then made a horrible movie from it.Watch for ""The Desperado Journal"" and ""Nacozari"" for the real story....."
1,A Hollywierd production on Buffalo Soldiers,"This movie is very sad. Seminole Negro Indian Scouts only served in Texas, not New Mexico. There are no officers present but Colonel Grierson, only the sergeant major. Grierson is presented as a wimp when he was in reality a hero of both the Civil War and western frontier. No american soldiers would have been able to sneak up on the Apache. No black soldiers ever had to dismount to pass through a western town, this is purely Hollywood. The song that is sung by the black troopers as they are carrying one of there deceased to the cemetary was written in the 1930s. This is one sad movie."
5,The 'real' Buffalo Soldiers,"Been trying to find this movie locally (NZ) for ages, there are several DVDs/movies with this title, and I'd seen this once on local TV ages ago. I was not disappointed on arrival of Mr Danny Glover playing the part of a coloured sergeant in a platoon of other coloured soldiers in the US Cavalry fighting the Apache. With all the usual prejudices prominent this platoon does its job. Excellent movie watched it several times already, still as good as I had remembered."
3,Great overview of a little known historical event,"As a teacher of Tx History, I find this movie to be helpful in dealing with a little known, and politically and socially sensitive topic. It is the story of the black men who joind the US military following the Civil War, and were stationed on the western frontier to take care of the Native problem. The movie explores the confrontation between these two persecuted minority groups, depicting both groups as men of dignity and honor. Reccommended for general history buffs, and those who are interested in black history."
5,Take time to reflect,"The wonderful quotations in ""Reflections on Life"" offer everything from ancient wisdom to contemporary humor. Klein's collection of inspiring quotes are gathered from both well-known and lesser known figures. I particularly like being able to turn to any of the sections (""What's Life?,"" ""Why We're Here,"" ""How toEnjoy the Journey""), read a quotation or two, put the book aside for a while, and then spend some time considering its message.Buy ""Reflections on Life"" and then take time to reflect."
5,The Gifted Journey,"If you have ever doubted why you are here, ""Reflections on Life"" will definitely help you find your purpose. It is an amazing collection of wisdom from far and near, yesterday and today. This book is an awesome journey on life, from some of the world's wisest men and women. Take this journey, with the author, Allen Klein, and begin to live your best life."
4,Ironcore Work Out Review,"The video was very challenging and I found it to be an excellent work out. However, the structure of the video seems to have quite a bit of time wasted. She structured it so that you complete one set in its entirety, then the second and then the third. Additionally, there is a 2 minute break between the first and the second sets and then a full minute between the 2nd and the 3rd sets. Plus, there is a 30 second break after each routine. If the video was structured so you completed all three sets, one after the other, and with a shorter break after each routine, the video would probably be 30 minutes instead of 40. That's my only complaint about it, but otherwise, an excellent work out."
3,VHS Old School,"Bought this for My niece an she loves Dora, WIll buy products again from this selleri n the future if need be"
3,My daughter loved it.,Dora was one of my daughter's favorite characters when she was 4. She danced through the whole thing.
1,TOO MUCH MAGIC,"I know that I am a little extreme on this one but I have to tell what I think. (Meet my cousin, the witch, you might understand.)We love Dora at our house and my son is also speaking Spanish becuase of Dora.I have one complaint about the Dora series. Some episodes contains LOTS of magic references. I bought this tape to enjoy music and dancing. Both episodes contain magical items. The magic music box and a magic flute.Like I said, I know that I am a bit extreme about magic but I threw this video away. I do not think that this is material appropriate for my two-year old.Buy Dora but pick a different video!!"
2,All the right ingredients but poor quality.,"I would have loved this product - it had all the right ingredients but put together badly. The sound quality was unbelievable, like it had been randomly dubbed from cassette tapes. The songs were done with several voices and often several layers, which made deciphering sounds very difficult. This just completely goes against the grain of learning a new language for children, where sound differentiation is an important developmental step. I couldn't listen to this product over and over again like I could with the Random House ""Baby's First Words"" series, which unfortunately does not come in German."
5,"The Perfect ""Just One More Story"" Before Bed","The other night, my three-year-old son couldn't sleep. I took out my daughter's copy of Flying Over Brooklyn and started to read. He was wide-eyed and smiling through the entire adventure and absolutely surprised when we reached the end, ""That was a dream?"" he asked. ""Yes, go to sleep so you can have an adventure too,"" I replied. ""Wow, I would if I could have dreams THAT good!"" I am sure that when my children are older they will appreciate the dreamy glimpses of a world far removed from our own (Brooklyn) and the historic significance of a child's recollection of an unusual event, but for now, they simply enjoy sharing the boy's dream-come-true flight over a snow-covered city. Meanwhile, I appreciate the positive spin it gives to the words, ""Bed-time!"""
5,A Personal Kiwi-Yankee Dictionary,"By defining English words and phrases unique to New Zealand, author Leland effectively describes at least a bit about New Zealanders and New Zealand culture also--and his affection for them, and for language, comes across well. Provides a look at the country and people through examination of their use of language. Humorous, good-natured, informative, and very enjoyable, I was given this book by a friend and just wish it were longer and updated to include any recent additions."
4,"Bonzer, mate","Even if you don't plan a trip to New Zealand in the near future, you can read this book and spice up your vocabulary. I've rated it four stars instead of five merely because it's now eleven years old.NZ slang evolves quite quickly, partly due to the prevalence of what's known as the Big OE--the big overseas experience, where young Kiwis take off for England and the Continent for a period of years, some never to return. This foreign immersion results in the inclusion of English slang expressions into the NZ idiom.As a 30-year expatriate Kiwi, I found myself enjoying again the colorful language I heard and used in my youth. A new edition would be greatly appreciated, and a must for every traveler planning on spending more than a couple of weeks in NZ."
4,Cool book,I am a kiwi living in the states and bought this book to see what its like. Pretty cool although a lot of the words in the book arent typical of just New Zealanders. Recommended to tourists visitng New Zealand if they want to pick up native lingo. Book in good condition also.
3,Try a Little Harder,"Kris Needs has a nice writing style, and bubbles with a lot of enthusiasm for Keith, so it's too bad he hasn't been paying better attention: The book is full of glaring inaccuracies that you don't even need to be a particularly intent Stones fan or Keith devotee to notice. If you were having trouble finding a competent researcher, editor and/or proofreader, Kris, all you had to do was call me!"
4,good reference book,"Definitely a very comprehensive textbook which treats many relevant and modern advances in the field. A must-have for every researcher in solid state NMR. Downside is that the book is written in the style of a reference book, and not really good as teaching material. But overall I give it 4 stars. Michael Mehring's book on solid state nmr is still the best teaching manual to learn the theory."
5,Excellent Summary of the Scientific Facts,"This short, easy to read, booklet presents the question very concisely. What will you have, scientific facts based on 200 years of research by millions of people OR creationist ""facts"" based on Fundamentalist religion? It's pretty clear from this short booklet that the validity of the Earth's age and evolution are solidly established. They are as close to facts as anything in science can be. This booklet gives a very short and concise description of what science knows. There is a brief introduction to current theories about the origin of the universe, Earth and life. It goes on to summarize the scientific evidence supporting evolution and then more specifically human evolution. It also make a clear statement that IN NO WAY does accepting the fact of evolution contradict belief in God. This is a good booklet to pass out in lecture situations where creationist try to pass of their religion using bogus scientific ""facts""."
4,Well balanced primer for the curious...,"As someone interested in the creationist/evolution debate, this short but well-articulated book is one that I would recommend to anyone with a similar interest. The NAS not only oversees a plethora of scientific investigation but is a body well respected for it's thoroughness and objectivity in the vast realm we call scientific inquiry. 'Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences' brings together the thoughts and evidence of leading researchers debating one of society's most polarizing topics."
2,Garden apron,"The good is it has nice large pockets to put items in, the bad is the straps used to tie the apron on are very stiff and made it hard for someone to tie behind their back. This was for my wife and I will be adding a quick disconect buckel to the straps..... this is something the manufacture should have thought of."
2,Can't keep it tied,"I was sure I'd love this and use it all the time, but I don't. It's always coming untied and falling off, particularly when it's loaded with a pruner, pocket knife, plier, and phone, which it has plenty of room for. I think the waist string is too narrow and too short (34"" waist). I find it cuts into me because it is so narrow. It would be better with a wider strap and clip closure, like on a dog collar or fanny pack, or with a buckle. It's decently made, so earns stars for that, but for me, it's useless."
3,Disapponited to hear mostly spanish versions,"I am a native Brazilian and purchased this CD in hopes of hearing my native language. I was very disappointed to hear that most of the songs are the SPANISH version!!! There are about 3 or 4 that are native portuguese... If you are homesick (like me) and want to be remineded of our Brasil, DO NOT buy this CD, as you will feel like your in the middle of Little Havana in Miami."
3,Disappointed!,"I ordered this, paid for express shipping and when it came there was NO Litter inside. Talk about false advertising!"
5,One of the Poetry Collections I Turn to Again and Again,"Stanley Plumly is one of my very favorite poets, and one of my greatest influences. Three of the poems from this collection stand out in particular: ""After Whistler""; ""Promising The Air""; and ""Maples"". ""After Whistler"" includes such turns of phrase as ""There in the calendar dark"" which are words you feel physically and understand emotionally.In ""Promising The Air"", Plumly describes a woman who dreams of a small boy and cries for him in her sleep, and he finishes the poem by dedicating it to her and ""for the boy""-- which is a Stevens-like abstraction of acknowledging the real force and presence of the dream boy.In ""Maples"", Plumly describes a vacation with his parents, the ""honey moon"" in the trees, and driving along the road in the dark.I am describing all of these poems from memory because I know them so well; Plumly is one of the most important contemporary poets we have and deserves far more attention."
5,Your restoration will be more accurate with this book!,"After 30 years experience, I still learned a great deal about the many variations in H-D twins over the years (does have some minor ommissions on 45"" models). Take a copy with you to swap meets to make sure you get the parts you need. Worth 10 times the purchase price."
4,The one and only,"Das beste Restaurationsbuch, das ich kenne. Leider sind die Bilder nicht von bester Qualität und einige Dinge sind nicht korrekt, aber wo findet man mehr Informationen über alte Harleys?"
4,Great for Adults too,"Get passed the songs, which although catchy, get a bit too much after awhile, (especially if you are watching vol.1 and 2 in succession) and this video will appeal to anyone with an interest in trucks, dozers, harvesting and farm equipment and big machinery. Volume 2 is also excellent so buy both and see Big Foot in action, truck drags, logging operations, the Freightliner assembly line, earthmoving and some excellent remote control toy action. Very watchable videos for all ages. John Deere enthusiasts will find these videos exceptionally collectable."
1,bogus,"I have seen other books claiming information about UFOs, strange happenings, etc. By far, this is the most bogus of all. In fact, there is barely any information contained in it in the first place that is not obviously bluffed up into ridiculous fiction. It talks about satanic/demonic prayers mostly and worshipping strange goddesses. Basically, the insipid book lacks information, and gets the reader nowhere."
2,Only partial success.,"While this book has enabled me to achieve moderate success in turning partially invisible (my feet only), it has been no use at all in teaching me to levitate. Unless you count the fact that when my feet are invisible, it appears that I am a footless man hovering four inches off the ground. Could not recommend this produce in good conscience to any serious practitioner."
5,Ummm,"An excellent book! A virtual bible for the invisible practitioner. Commander X thoroughly outlines, with easy to follow examples, the step by step processes needed to become invisible. It will take some practice however, it took me a couple of weeks to master, so if you dont see results right away don't fret, keep trying. Your efforts will be rewarded handsomely. This book is not for the laymen however, those of you less seasoned in the art of becoming invisible may want to start with Jack Hoffs book ""invisibility for dumby's"". You may also want to read ""Casper the Freindly Ghost"", because you should never use these powers for evil purposes. The last thing society needs is a bunch of mean spirited ghosts roaming about."
1,Great stuff!,"Here is another tip if you want to become invisible : rip you clothes to shreds, rub dirt in your face, and sit down in the street with an empty tin-can in you hand (be sure to keep your eyes down). It really works!! NO ONE WILL SEE YOU! Amazing..."
1,What are you people thinking,"I dont see how any of you people can believe anything this guy is saying. People think that if some twenty year old D&D geek says he is a retired commander its true, is this weird to only me? You cant just become invisible from reading a book. I only received that book because of a shipping switch and I cant believe anybody would buy it, other than a pactical joke. I highly advise you to pass on it and choose somethig a little more intellectually suitable."
1,This book is misleading,"This book lacks information, gives you parts of spells from thegreater key of soloman, and tries to confuse you with pictures ofastral projection. I found that there was not enough ""how-to"" info on levitation and the invisibility section was excerpted from another, better book. Don't buy it.. trust me.. They try to pass off astral projection pics for ones of physical levitation..."
2,Please don't buy it if you aren't looking for a life story.,Basically over 3/4 of the book are about this guys life experiences if you want to levitate yourself alone don't get this book because all it does is say how to levitate the table (Didn't work in my case) and yogic levitation (it sounded so stupid I didn't even try it and It goes more in depth with Invisibility (I've tried every way yet it still doesn't work)mabye I'm wrong or something but if you're a kid then DON'T I REPEAT DON'T GET THIS BOOK!!!!! I rated it a 2 because it didn't not tell you how to do it but it also is mostly a life story and for me it didn't work I don't know mabye it will work for you but all I'm saying is that it didn't work for me so try looking at books not by Commander X I don't even have a way to research the guy geez!
1,NOT even worth a look,"I had bought this book with an open mind. Once I started reading, I kept waiting for the how-to or just some interesting information. Sadly, I got nothing. The first half is about satanic/demonic theory. The second is basically a list of prayers to a pantheon of gods. It claims to be in Sanskrit, but I know Sanskrit, and this grammar is all wrong. One small part talks about how people(ninjas) used smoke bombs to cloud other eyes and cover themselves in their bombs to escape quickly. Even this trivial info is described vaguely. Sorry to say, the book is nothing more than a joke, believe me."
1,repetitive and just off the topic....,"when I first got this book, I was feeling a bit weird just reading this psycho non-sense. nothing but disapointment came from this book soon after. first of all, its not even a how-to guide at all, secondly, the only time it focuses anything on the main topics is when it has a paragraph about ancient ninjas using smoke bombs to cloud other people's eyes and thus become ""invisible"". the topic(s) this book focuses much more on is about occult/religious happenings, which sound like nothing more than plain spurred up accounts used to fool the superstitious. The part that gets really repetitive is about satanism and its followers, which is just plain freaky as how the author describes it. Nothing much more than that, theres no how to stuff, and the only interesting part is one or two pics with smoke in it saying that that is someone worshipping some demonic god. my advice- dont buy this made-up non sense unless you are just out to waste your money and time."
1,Much ado about nothing,"The author is probably laughing all the way to the bank about all the gullible people who bought this book. The book contains no real instruction on how to become invisible or levitate. There is some half-way interesting history but I don't think you can trust the author even at this level. The Satanical rituals are there just for the sensationalism; what does that have to do with invisibility or levitation, anyway? Hard to believe people could be taken in by this nonsense."
1,BIG disappointment,"Any person who enjoys reading about sci-fi, conspiracies, or something new will find this disappointing. In reality, it is equivalent to a jumbled bunch of text that makes no sense. The hocus-pocus pointless stories inside are as dull as they come, expecting you to believe everything the author says, like ""alien conspiracies"" that tell nothing new. Obsolete mischief tricks, satan worship, etc. the content is thrown up randomly, yet all is vague even to the end! I suggest buying something else."
1,this is definitely a rip-off,"Here is my opinion on the book- it lacks in information, practicality, and most of all it doesn't have originality whatsoever. The ""steps"" to whatever it is talking about are nothing more than aimless devil chanting and praying, to make you gain self-esteem I assume. Its all excerpted from other text in the first place anyways like banned bibles. Pathetic, useless, and not a good read. This to me, was definitely a WASTE of money."
3,Is Commander X really Steve Richards ??,"I must admit to more than a little disappointment for the way in which commander x slimd down.What was two beautiful texts ,factualy yes this is accurate only the barebones are presented here, your money would be much better spent on getting the originals of these books & i should know i own two copys of each of Steve Richards books & as for Commander X please please stop ! copy & pasting classics & stick to what you know best Alien conspiracy etc.... ps nothing against his other work"
3,Interesting HISTORY,This book is a great history concerning the arts of Invisibility and Levitation and a few techniques have been thrown in here and there. It's entertaining to read but if you're looking for methods it just doesn't go into that much detail. Looks good on a bookshelf!
1,2cents,"After reading this one I thought being invisible and levitating might not be such a good idea. I felt like I was invisible being in contact with this wayward source. No one spoke to me, I was a stranger to myself. (Ok, maybe Im exaggerating a bit, it was rough though.) Its more like a book report on the subject. If your going to become invisible after reading this book its only through your foreordained fate. You'll likely to be a prisoner in another realm. I think only time and inborn dispostion will manifest these things. Who knows if its not going on by us in passing spirit, you'd never know. Just look at the invisible girl. She's a doll, but she knows how to handle her endowments."
2,Waste of Money (especially if you live overseas),"Although on the outside the book looks quite interesting, once you open the covers (as i have just done) its full of sensationalised nonsence. Basically, this book says that to become invisible you must create a 'cloud of matter' by concentrating on a blank wall, and then surround yourself in this cloud. Thats it. All the rest of the book is about Zenon and the god of this and god of that. There are a few interesting facts littered about. But its badly organised. I am very annoyed with this book. Buy something else. trust me."
4,solid and light,I have bought this monopod and I have been impressed by the built quality and the light weight of this product.Quick to open this monopod is very simple to use with my 100-300mm
1,Shame on RCA,"This wonderful collection from the 50's is spoiled by an abysmal mono transfer by RCA. Some of the selections are available on ""A Festival Of Carols / Robert Shaw Chorale"" in a much better stereo transfer, and the album also includes the original ""Many Moods of Christmas"" Shaw album."
2,Watch the Golf Channel instead.,"Very displeased with these so called ""instructional"" videos. The lessons are very short and too general. I am a 8 handicap looking to get better. These videos showed me absolutely nothing new and teach you very little about the golf swing's mechanics, or what should be running through your mind when trying to execute certain shots. You would think that the self-professed top instructor in the world, who teaches the best player in the world, would have a little more to share with the golfing community. I honestly think the videos are more of a plug for people to visit his golf schools. Watch Butch on the Golf Channel and you will learn ten times more about the golf swing there then on these videos."
1,Waste of Money!,"This should have been called the Butch Harmon auto-biography. He talked so much about himself, I'm suprised there was time for any golf instruction. In fact there was almost no fundamental teaching in the entire video. Save your money on this one."
2,Butch Harmon's Ultimate Golf,"Come on, Butch. I haven't seen the course management video, but the ones on the short and long games should have been entitled ""Butch Takes Some Bows and While at it Throws in a Few Golf Tips"". The content of these videos was extremely thin. I've seen you on The Golf Channel, and you obviously have a great deal of wisdom. I came away from these videos with one (1) insight I could take with me and that was how far to stand away from the golf ball for each club. I feel like I was fleeced in buying these videos and I don't often feel that way with a consumer purchase. Seriously, Butch, if you read this, I want my money back. Shame on you."
5,Early Railways,"Early RailwaysI enjoyed EARLY RAILWAYS. It filled in the gaps of the earliest railway history that was lacking in many other railway history books I have read. Beginning with railway development in England and Europe, it details the development of the railway up through the early 20th century. The book includes many fine drawings and photographs to complement the text.There is one publishing error that I identified. Part of a paragraph at the bottom of page 36 that includes ""and Hudson Line..."" through ""...Railroad [figure 50]"" actually belongs in the last payagraph on page 41 following the word ""Mohawk"". But this publishing error did not, to me, detract from the overall quality of the book."
2,How NOT To Research A Biography,"British entertainment writer, Fergus Cashin ghosted a number of show business autobiographies prior to undertaking his examination of Mae West's career published in 1981, shortly after her death. Cashin referred to West being ""of indeterminate sex"" and claimed ""the marathon love sessions of nonstop bed pounding...went on in Mae's head and probably nowhere else.""Critics panned Cashin for raising rhetorical questions and not conducting any original research. His book was released in England in hardback edition, and sold in the American market in a paperback version. The Library of Congress had a copy of Cashin's book in its collection, which has since inexplicably gone missing.Perhaps the wrath of Miss West's spirit vapourized this offensive text. For Mae West completists, this bizarre tome makes for an amusing, if inaccurate account of perhaps the most fascinating entertainer of the twentieth century."
1,Unreliable Customer Service,"Delivery estimate was April 8-18, 2007. I called Cross Country Furniture the week of April 8 to confirm the bed was being delivered on time (My guests were arriving April 22.) They told me it was going to be the delivered on or about April 18. I went ahead and bought the mattresses and sheets and on April 18 I called them again to ask when they would deliver and they told it was backordered 3 to 4 weeks. I had to cancel the order and now, I have to return the the mattresses/sheets and scramble for alternate sleeping arrangements for my guests."
5,Wendy in San Diego,A great read. I felt the premise was comparable in excitement and suspense to The Da Vinci Code
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,Items I put into the pockets fell out if I bent from the waste. A tool belt or fanny pack would work better.....so I will try one of those next. SAVE YOUR MONEY!
2,Not necessary,"I bought this book in the excitement of getting ready to become a ""Mrs."" but as it turns out, you can get all the info & forms you need to change your name pretty much on-line so I didn't use a single form out of the book. I did like the postcards and address labels that were included but again, didn't use any. It does come with a CD to format the labels but it didn't work so my advice is to spend the money on something else."
3,Good and Bad,"This book had its ups and downs. The forms in the book were helpful. Considering my wife was the person that I had bought it for, I don't really have first hand experience with the book. The impression I gathered from her was that it was easy to have all the forms in one place and it took her a couple hours to get them all down and in the mail. The software wasn't really all that good because it doesn't have anything that is useful. It has forms you can print off if you need more but I don't know why you would and the labels were kind of a pain to get to fit and then when they printed they smeared. So, if you are looking for all the forms in one spot this is a good book, but don't buy it for the software or labels. You can make your own on Microsoft Word."
1,t-shirt,"aight so i ordered this becuase i really liked the movie and was amped to find a reservoir dogs T. but when i got it i was really disappointed. the red letters at the bottom of the t shirt are some sort of fabric thats slowly deteriorating and over all looks weird . come to think of it ,it looks like lint thats been packed really tightly dyed red then gulled onto a t -shirt and its slowly falling off. i dont really like the shirt that i got."
1,This game sucks,MK 1 and MK 2 were pure gold. MK3 adds some cool characters but it totally sucks. The AI makes this game nearly unbearable they are super nazi cheese kings that know your every move before you even do it and magically avoid your moves and counter everything in a quick and cheese bs fest manner that the player con not come close to doing. The unfair level in this game makes it only fun playing two players. The bosses are unfair cheese lords too. This just sucks other than the new cyber ninja's nothing to care for here.
3,Where's Scorpion and Reptile (LOGO) SMK review,This game dissapoint's me.No Reptile or Scorpion? Don't worry though there are a few good replacement's for them like cyrax and sector. Bad graphics and bad sound. Wouldn't buy good game to rent though. If you would like to see any of my other reviews look for my logo which is SMK at the bottom or top of the review.OUT!(LOGO) SMK
3,This entry fell a bit short.....,"Wow, this was a rather large disappointment. The graphics, music and sound effects have all fallen short of MKII on this console, which is very odd. The controls are the same, but the additions to the gameplay have made things a bit easier, once you get accustomed to them.There are a total of 14 playable characters (not counting the hidden ones), but there is still no save feature. You might want to play Ultimate MK3 instead of this, as it adds much more replay value, unless you are a Mortal Kombat collector."
3,This game really did not live up to the hype,"Mortal Kombat 2 was one of the best SNES games ever made. It has amazing sound, graphics, and challenging gameplay. Now when MK3 came out it was kind of a disappointment but it was an even bigger disappointment on the SNES. What made the 2nd Mortal Kombat so great was its amazing soundtrack, digitilized speech and sound effects. This game has terrible music even when compared with the Genesis version, the sound effects are also horrible in this game. The graphics could have been way better. The Animalities were cool, but you couls say that about the Genesis version as well. There really isn't any reason to get this game, if you have an SNES or like SNES games get UMK3, that was good but like this game it has a lot of the same flaws."
3,Not enough padding,"I have used a pair of very similar kneepads for many years and love them. They look the same as these new ones but my old ones have the name ""Bucket Boss"" on them instead of ""Fiskars."" I was so excited to find these since I prefer this one strap design that allows me to get up and down and walk easily without removing them. Sad to say, while the design of these new ones is the same and they do stay on well, the padding is much thinner and I found that my knees hurt very quickly. I am disappointed because I really love the design. I guess I'll keep using my old battered ones until they completely fall apart and reserve these new ones for short stints only."
3,"Over-priced, poor straps","After reading the glowing reviews given by others, I am a bit disappointed in this product. First of all, the straps seem short. While I have only had a knee pad pop off once, I really have to stretch the material to get what seems to be a secure attachment of the velcro. I also wish that the plastic was smooth, because mud gets caught in the decorative grooves. They do seem to protect the knees well. For the same money, however, one can get the heavy-duty knee pads that concrete finishers wear, with decent straps and a shape that conforms more to a real knee. I wish that I had thought of looking to see what is available at a lumber yard or home improvement store before I bought these."
1,Fiskars knee pads,I would not recommend these knee pads for gardening. There is only one strap which cuts off circulation behind the knee and flop around if you walk in them. The best knee pads for gardening have two elastic bands andare flexible in addition to being soft. I am having trouble finding these.
4,a Great pair!,"These are really very comfortable! I have tried several pairs and decided on the Monica L. signiture model...... she used these extensively a few years ago While laying flooring and others...these came in handy and saved her knees...Comfortable and durable. A good value allows more time in awkward positions while comfortable so you can do what needs to be done like laying things,,,,flooring ,tile , etc.."
4,Great for around the house too,"I got these a few years ago to use when I scrub our tile floors. They make extended kneeling less[...] your knees and back and allow you to plug right through your chores. If you will be getting up and down a lot, they are a little bit of a pain (slipping, shifting) but if you will be kneeling on a floor, in a garage or in the garden without having to get up a lot, they are perfect!"
5,"Dreams, ""Evolution"" and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 2: A Seth Book","This book has answered a lot of questions I've had for years & years... it has opened up my understanding about a lot things I wanted to know more about. It is a book for seekers...those seeking a better understanding about life, themselves and all things Spiritual. It is not a book for the ""CLOSED MINDED""... but it can and will certainly facilitate a new path in your life journey if that is what you are craving, and for those on that path already...it provides EXHILARATING INSIGHT..."
5,sweet story of faith,"This is a true story about the author's grandfather. Over 100 years ago his grandfather moved west to Colorado to start his family. All around the land was coved in spruce trees. One winter the weather is really bad and they think they will have to cut all the tress for fire wood. 2 geese have made their home under one tree and one is hurt and can't move on. The grandmother in the story begs the grandpa to leave the tree a little longer. He does and the story has a happy ending.This book can be valuable as a teaching tool. It is a book that teaches the value of family, material things, memories, nature, and history. Life cycles, the seasons, and holidays are so important to the family in the book.I would recommend this book to others. The book is a great holiday book but the themes in the story should be taught year around."
4,Highly recommended for fans,"This is a great DVD for poor mugs like me who didn't discover Harry until it was too late. I have been a Harry fan for 20 years now and, although the quality isn't fantastic, this DVD gave my a chance to see the great man in action.I love it.It is true that the German audience are less than vocal, but I think that they are enjoying the concert in their own subdued fashion. And of course there is that guy in the front row who is making up for everyone else. You can't miss this guy; if his smile was any bigger the top of his head would fall off. A real one man audience.So, if you are like me and never got the chance to see Harry, don't be put off; grab this DVD. It is well worth the price."
5,An unforgetable tale of war.,"While Mr. Russ' account of the Chosin Reservoir campaign has been attacked by those that back the account of the U.S.Army, what is truly at the heart of this history, is how ANYONE came out of there alive. This is truly the very best account of what it is like to fight for survival against both the weather and a very large foe. As hard as it is to believe, the weather actually allowed many American soldiers to live. This is a wonderful/horrible account of what happened in the winter of 1950 in North Korea. This campaign may actually have prevented WWIII. Prior to this campaign, the Communist Chinese felt that the U.S. was a force that could be beaten. The learned otherwise due to the sacrifice of many of our neighbors in this battle."
1,Marine propaganda,"I received this book as a Christmas present and am grateful that at least my money was not wasted on it. While to a certain extent it chronicles the miraculous survival of a military outfit, the author delves too much into petty squabbles with the U.S. Army, into trivial and inane reflections of the solidiers involved, and into racial and sexual biases. I was much more interested in learning the details of this operation than I was in the personal prejudices of soldiers, which were borne out in virtually every page of the book. I concur with a fellow reviewer that additional maps should have been enclosed to assist the reader to more easily digest information. This is not a piece of literature by any stretch of the imagination; it is, instead, simply a work of Marine propaganda and I now think much less of the U.S. Marine Corps than I did before I read this awful book."
1,this book is a waste of time,"This book is a complete waste of time for anyone who is serious about history. It is nothing more than the author,s slanted opinion of how things went. Acording to the book the American Army was totaly and completely incompantent. the ROC army was fast to leave the seen of any action, the North Korean Army and the Chinise Army couldent fight their way out of a wet paper bag and the only rason they prevailed was dumb luck and total disregard for their troups. But the Marines on the other hand were the best fighting men ever seen who could do no wrong.The book is choppy and jumps around and all I can say is it is good paper for the out house."
4,Solid History But Could Be Better,"Martin Russ has done a solid job with the scope of the battle around the Chosin Reservoir, bringing warfare to life with many personal quotes and personalities. He has done a lot of research, and done a reasonable job, making sense of what was a confused and wide-spread battle.That said, the book could have been much better if it included a lot more maps, showing the hills and perimeters mentioned and the positions of the various Marine and Army forces, and the lines of attack and units of the Chinese divisions. In addition, the sections, which cover days and nights of battle, could have been broken up with subtitles by day/unit(s) involved, which would have made for a more easily followed narrative."
4,A bone-chilling story of bravery and heroism.,"If you enjoy the styles of John Keegan, Stephen Ambrose and Cornelius Ryan, you will like this bone-chilling story about the Marines' breakout from the Chosin Resevoir in December 1950. Like all military stories of this type, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all the soldiers mentioned. There are only four large-scale maps for guidance. The book desperately needs small-scale maps to support the narrative."
3,Exciting account with annoying flaws.,"Martin Rus' account of the Chosin campaign is gripping. As an oral history it's real page turner. It is a terrifying account. Yet, there are several factors that made it hard to follow. The most glaring of which was the lack of time references. The whole campaign is described by day and night. There are almost no date references. This may be done on purose to give the reader an idea of what it may have been like for the Marines on the ground but it is hard on the reader. This is compounded when the author switchs back and forth between the naratives of participants. He tends to tell each of their stories form beginning to end. This gives the impression of many days passing rather than the events ocuring concurrently."
2,Breakout,"The book is a good account of men in battle under extreme weather conditions. Most Marines will fall in love with the author and his story. Also like most Marines, Martin Russ finds it necessary to degrade the US Army whenever possible. He views the Army, as basically children with guns and without the protection of the Marines would be totally lost. Every Marine was brave, noble and strong while every GI was a coward, weak and confused. Mr. Russ makes fun of some of the Army division ""nick names"" i.e. Tropic Lighting and Screaming Eagles for example. It reminds me that in WWII these same ""doggie"" Screaming Eagles of the 101st Airborne Division held off up to 250,000 Germans at a little town called Bastogne in one of the coldest winters on record. By the way the Germans had hundreds of Tiger Tanks supporting their attempt to overrun the 101st, yet the Army paratroops never gave up nor retreated. Just a thought, but is there a comparison here to Chosin?"
5,"""Those poor bastards....they've got us surrounded.....""","Adding my pennies worth of commentary to another Marine's memoir that is already a classic.With men such as James Webb and Lt. General Trainor, USMC (Ret) writing so eloquently about this book it seems almost pointless to add anything else. However, if your a devotee of military history and have been looking for a Korean War treasure, BREAKOUT is it.Two other books that come to mind regarding this same war and piece of real estate are Joe Owens' COLDER THAN HELL and James Brady's THE COLDEST WAR.Mr. Russ has done his former Marine buddies proud as well as the memory of all our forces sent to that hateful conflict.Here's to the 1st, 5th and 7th Marines!"
5,"Breakout: The Chosin Reservoir Campaign, Korea 1950","A gift that was specially requested from my son who is a United States Marine, serving active duty in Iraq. He loved it. Thank you."
1,Horrible Marine Bias and shameful attack on the Army,"in 1999 even the Commandant of the Corps admitted the stand by the Army troops on the east side of the Reservoir was the only thing that saved the 1st Marine Div. Google 31st RCT, Navy Presidential unit citation, and Chosin and you'll see what I mean. Due to a shift of Marines from the east to west side of the Reservoir, the bulk of the Chinese assault fell on the Army, not the Marines. The understrength, poorly equipped Army troops (many were untrained Korean fillers) held off 2+ Chinese divisions for 5 days while the Marines got ready to move to the coast. The snide comments about Don Faith's well deserved Medal of Honor are shameful to say the least. Spend the effort and cash to get Appleman's books if you want the real story."
2,"The ""Chosin Few"" Deserve Better","One would be hard-pressed to find a greater story of courage and heroism than that of the Chosin Resevoir Campaign. But if you read this book you might be duped into thinking that the ""bad guys"" in the story were not the Koreans or Chinese, but the United States Army. Russ's ""Marine good, Army bad"" ideology gets old very fast and would seem to be an insult to the Army boys who fought and DIED beside the perfect, flawless Marines. Other than this un-intelligent bias against fellow American soldiers, Russ is a pretty bad writer and gives little context to what was happening and why it was happening. This leaves the reader befuddled and makes the narrative choppy and hard to decipher. In short, there are many better studies of this campaign out there. Read those first. Semper Fi."
2,Hard to get into,"Frannie is a Canadian transplant editor who considers herself the quintessential New Yorker. When she discovers she's pregnant and wants to take advantage of the free health care offered in Canada, she's denied entry back into the US due to an expired Visa. So off she goes to sponge off mum and dad and then her brother and sister in law... until the baby daddy Calvin arrives on the scene. The problem is, Calvin is not the man she envisioned spending the rest of her life with.Told in typcial fisrt-person chick lit style, the story is a little hard to get through because it's often so whiny and anti-climatic. After awhile I just thought, who gives a crud about any of the characters. And as I approached the last page I thought ""is that it?"" Yeah, I want four hours of my life back.Tracy Vest, April 2009"
2,Not sure,"I am still trying to finish this book. I'm not sure if it's the writing style or some of the language she uses but I find myself having to re-read sentences trying to figure out what she's saying! I have a college education, LOVE to read and didn't sleep for a weekend while I read the da vinci code but I'm just not sure about this book. I love the shopaholic books, stephanie plum novels, etc. Maybe I'll try something else by this author to see if it gets better."
4,Laugh out loud funny!,"I really enjoyed this book. Parts of it were so funny that I was, quite literally, crying as I read them. My sister had suggested this a while ago, and I'm so glad that I finally found the time to read it!What an enjoyable read."
3,Decent enough chick lit,"One of the problems with chick lit, like the Shopaholic series, is the author tends to make the main character so helpless, so stupid, so beset by problems of her own making, that you just can't feel any sympathy for the character. ""You know, if every chapter you do something moronically stupid when the solution presents itself, no matter how much I see myself in this situation, I can't really feel any sympathy for your serial stupidity. I really can't.""Pearson, thankfully, avoids making her character a serial victim of her own stupidity. The downside is the main character is, get this, a writer/editor. There is nothing more boring than a writer writing about the life of a writer. It's the laziest form of writing. Maybe, I dunno, do some research. Find out about another profession and how a raising a child might affect that woman's profession?Despite this shortcoming and the nearly non-existent plot, there are some rather nice little jokes about mommyhood."
2,"Less than Perfect, More like dissapointing","I thought that the story line would be cute. But it was lame, very under devloped, the charicters were boring, i didnt feel like I really got to know them or had any connection to them at all. And I felt like their tale of parenthood and so called love was very untrue and borning. I was waiting for the story to pick up and for Calvin and Frannie to have one of those moments were they were filled with passion and fell deep in love, but short of him introducing her to his stoner friends as the love of his life, that didnt happen. And OMG who names thier baby Lester? The story was borning, the whole book was dissapointing, so do yourself a favor and not buy this book, but something more along the line of Little Earthquakes by Jennifer Weiner."
2,Almost a waste of time,"I found this book, for the most part to be a big disappointment. I was encouraged early on by a few chapters that were so funny that I was laughing out loud, but towards the last 1/3 of the book, the story (and the characters) just became dull and whiney. Who wants to read a book about a couple of losers? Well me...but only if they are loveable losers and I'm sorry to say these characters were not. If it weren't for the humor early on, I would regret the time I spent reading it."
3,Tension too tight,"I immediately noticed the tension on this ladder is too strong even when adjusted to the holes closest to the spring. I told my whole family to pull down very hard to open it and when putting it back up to make sure it does not slip from their hands and slam.Well, an electrician was working in the attic and it did slip and slam and the pop rivet heads came right through the thin wood skin. I had to drill them out and replace them with bolts.I was surprised at how much it cost considering how cheaply some of it appears to be built. Other than that, the ladder seems functional and I an glad to have one."
1,Inferior sound,The DVD side is Dolby 5.1 which is a highly compressed sound format to be used as a sound track for DVD video to fit it all on the disk. Put it in the computer and check the size of the files compared with the cd. How could it sound better? So much of the musical information is missing. If you are mainly using the DVD disk volume for audio then you can use DVD audio which uses more volume than any cd can take. Using volume as a guide Dolby 5.1 is inferior to DTS which is inferior to cd which is inferior to 96/24 PCM which is inferior to sacd which is inferior to DVD audio. So why is Sony pressing these inferior formats .... because they now realise it is a good idea to have video and surround mixes in their music disks. But they do not support DVD audio as it is in competition to their SACD format and so you are given an inferior sound format instead.
3,"Very talented, but nothing original","There is no denying the talent of the Garza brothers. The only thing lacking on this CD is originality. With the exception ofwhat I think is the best song ""Heaven"", there is nothing new on this album. It is bothersome listening to the other tracks andsaying to yourself, ""oh this is a SRV type song"", ""there is a Santana type song"". The styles and riffs are blatantly lifted from these other artists.My advice to the Brothers Garza - Use your awesome talent to develop your own style and material for your next CD. Push the envelope on your creativity. If you do this, you will have me as your biggest fan, and you will be on the way to being a supergroup."
4,4 Stars,"Excellent Tracks:T2,T5,T6,T7,T11Very Good Tracks:T3,T10Good Tracks:T8,T12Meh Tracks:T1Bad Tracks:T4,T9Horrible Tracks:~~~Note:Videos,Interludes,Bridges,Introductions,and enhanced features not rated."
4,loveeee it,This is a great CD. I bought it for my mother. I almost took it back. lol just kdding. Anyhoo...I plan on purchasing it for me soon.
5,Los Lonely Boys ARE heaven!,"I first saw snippits of Los Lonely Boys in commercials for the Austin WB channel. I really didn't know much about them but I definitely liked their sound.Over the next few months I started hearing their songs on the local radio stations and I fell in love with them. Sure their lyrics can be sappy at times but that's just part of their charm. They are beyond talented and quite obviously live for their music.When I found they were opening for Willie Nelson I camped out at my computer waiting for tickets to go on sale and I managed to snag some front row seats!! To make a long story short, I had to keep from throwing myself on stage. They have an incredible energy and an unavoidable charisma. Knowing that they are siblings makes their group even more unique.You won't regret buying this album! It has a sound that most anyone can appreciate and melodies that you'll find yourself humming day after day. Buy this now!"
4,Don't be fooled by their looks,"I figured this cd would be good, but was surprised to hear just how good, no great, it actually was. After hearing Heaven on the radio, I immediately went out and bought this cd. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this definitely was not it. It's a beautiful sounding, laid back album. There's not a single song on this cd that I don't love listening to. As you go through it, it just keeps getting better and better. This is perfect music to put on when having company, driving in your car or just relaxing. You will not be disappointed with this purchase, I promise. ;)"
5,Los Lonely Boys Rock!,"Los Lonely Boys have brought music back into my life. I had practically stopped listening to the radio. All I was hearing was rap or songs with rap in them. Then I heard Heaven. I liked it so much I bought the cd thinking that there may be one or at the most two good songs on it. Was I pleasantly surprised! These three brothers from Texas have put out a cd that has not one bad song on it. I listen to it constantly and never have to skip a song that I dont like. I have purchased the cd for friends and all have loved it. Now, I am anxiously awaiting their new cd which will be out this fall. If you are debating whether to get this cd...do it! You will fall in love with LLB and Texican Rock and Roll!"
4,"Excellent CD, but......","I agree with most of the other reviewers that this is an excellent CD. Both the singing and guitar playing sound top-notch, and they certainly know how to write catchy tunes. My only complaint revolves around songs like Hollywood and More Than Love which are just so sappy and don't seem to fit on a slightly harder edged album. I think that the last 2 songs on the CD also fit into this category. Aside from that, I think you can put on this CD and get ready for some excellent jamming. (Guitarists who don't really like vocals should be aware that all songs except Onda have 3 or 4 minutes of lyrics.)"
5,They Rock,This CD is very good. It is totaly unique. I can listen to it all day long. Buy it you will like it.
4,Bad band name; good cd,"My first thought after hearing this cd was that this is the kind of music that Carlos Santana should be making nowadays, instead of working with Rob Thomas and Michelle Branch and whoever else happens to be popular and trendy at the time.Another thought I had is that this is a horrible name for a band. It sounds corny and it sounds too close to Los Lobos. It's almost embarassing to tell your friends that you're listening to a band named ""Los Lonely Boys"".But it's really hard to dislike this cd, so I would recommend it. It's really quite catchy, without selling out. A fair amount of rock; good songs; good harmonies; I like the Spanish influences throughout. Overall a very promising debut."
3,It's just ok,"Yes, it makes your toes tap. Yes, it has some great guitar licks. What it's really lacking is a blues sensibility at the singing end - those polished harmonies leave me feeling like the whole thing just runs together and after about the fourth song, I'm looking to change the channel. Blues is supposed to crunchy, gravelly, dirty-sounding - not polished. At least it's better than Menudo!"
5,Great Tex-Mex Blues Rock,"In the great tradition of Los Lobos and Stevie Ray Vaughn, Los Lonely Boys provide a great selection of music."
5,Los Lonely Boys,"Although I'm sure I'm not part of the target market for this album (over 50!)I absolutely LOVE this album. My son bought this for me a couple of Christmases ago, and as another reviewer mentioned, I listened to the whole CD without skipping any tracks and fell in love with the sound.Both instumental and vocal harmonies are fabulous; no one voice or instrument overpowers another. If you enjoy good, harmonious guitar and vocals, you should listen to this CD. If you have a soul, you'll be hooked from the first note."
5,Love this album!,"Excellent album! LOVE the guitar and vocals. Several songs have that distinctive Santana or Stevie Ray Vaughn sound, so if you like that sound you should like this. There's one track I'm not quite as fond of - I think it's track 7 (the melody/harmony are a bit too close to the previous song so sounds a little redundant), but I can live with that."
2,THIS is the best pop got in 2004?,"In spite of the fact that I completely disliked the single ""Heaven"", I borrowed this from my local library because of all its Grammy nominations, thinking I may have missed something. (There was a precedent: I never have liked the Counting Crows song ""Mr. Jones"" (still don't) but I love the rest of the CD and wondered if this might be the same type of thing...)Having listened to the CD several times, only a few songs made my ears perk up and they were fairly mediocre. I am completely astounded that they were nominated for Record of the Year, New Artist of the Year, Best Rock Instrumental Performance, and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal (they actually won that for ""Heaven""). If this CD *really* is one of the best the recording industry had to offer this year, it might be time for me to say the perpetual crochety old record fan line: ""Music was better when I was young..."""
4,"Good Album, But sounds a lot like......","Great Album, growing up being a straight up thrash metal head, maybe I am doing just that, growing up. I am finding myself listening to plenty of bands within this Blues/Rock/R&B Genre. Great production, and these brothers have no-where to go but up. But I must, they do sound awfully similar to jone of my Faves, Big Head Todd and The Monsters, Who to me, are the kings of the Genre.But Hey, nothing but the best to these ""Lonely Boys"", Cause I will be looking forward to a follow up release."
2,Not What I was Hoping For.,"I was hoping for some guitar inspired blues rock. Somethingalong the lines of Kenny Wayne Sheppard, Chris Duarte or JoeBonamassa to name a few. You do notice the influences ofSantana, Los Lobos & SRV. But musically it doesn't have a lotof guitar fire, real boring. Very Santana inspired andextremely ""POP"" oriented stuff (chick music). Which is fine ifthats what you like. A couple songs Henry does let his guitarabilities rise to the forefront but that doesn't happen enough.These guys have the talent, they just need to apply it. We canonly hope that the best is yet to come!"
1,Could never review this item!!,"I ordered one, that would not play - Amazon was great to replace it, but the replacement one wouldn't play either!! I am pretty sure that it would have gotten several stars had I got to listen to it!!"
3,Decent....,"I liked this cd okay mainly because of the song ""Senorita"". They are a very different kind of band. I heard of them because they played near me in Columbia, MO and everybody was amazed. The cd isn't as great as what some people say though but maybe I just don't like Spanish type music."
5,Los Lonely Boys,"I like the CD a lot, a whole lot. The more I listen to it, the more I like it. Am anxious to receive the other one I ordered."
5,What a great debut,"This is flat-out a great CD. The guitar licks suck you into it. The vocals have a smooth mix of English and Spanish that is fine. The songs have a great beat. I admit that I may be biased by living in Austin and having these guys as a local band, but they deserve to be more than just a hot local band. Buy the CD and see what I mean."
5,BRILLIANT FIRST EFFORT,"This is almost of the same standard / quality as the first INDIGENOUS CD. These brothers rock and like INDIGENOUS they incorporate some of their heritage into their sound. LOS LONELY BOYS are like a mix of LOS LOBOS / SANTANA / SRV and their own tex/mex touches. Great songs, good vocals, great guitar playing, superb production, it's all here. Great playing by all 3 brothers. HENRY avoids the danger of a lot of the younger guitarists to fill every space with notes. He chooses all the right notes and plays with great feel and subtlety. The tone of his guitar is always a delight and most of his solos are memorable and full of emotion.If you like SANTANA / SRV / INDIGENOUS or LOS LOBOS you will love this."
4,they can't be lonely anymore....,"i found this cd a bit of a homecoming to me. I hail from texas and am quite familiar with the ""Austin"" sound, i.e. SRV, the Sexton bros, and (although not exactly from the big T)David Baerwald, (among others of course). I feel comfortable adding los lonely boys to the group. their songs have a very strong lyrical content and their guitar playin' aint bad either! I only rated this CD 4 stars because i feel they are still young and the best is yet to come!"
3,O. K.,"They're pretty good for a new band, I have a copy of this cd, plus their dvd I just don't find it as good as the other reviewer has stated. I have heard people compare Henry to S.R.V. lets get real he's pretty good, but not near Stevie Ray Vaughan's quality, I think they will get better in time. Though this is an o.k. first effort, this band in my opinion is way over rated."
4,Unique sound and talented...they'll be back for more,"Took a chance on this CD as it wasn't my normal taste, and in the end, it was a solid pick.You'll know as soon as you give it a listen one time through that there is something special going on, that they have real talent and will be making good music for years."
4,NIIIIICE!!,"Believe the hype. These guys are excellent. I've listened to the CD only once and I know that it will get a lot of play in my stereo. They are kind of a throwback to the music you love, but at the same time they are fresh and original. Very, very good."
5,Great Music,"I heard Heaven on TV. Next day I bought the CD. All the songs are great in this CD. It is a masterpiece. It is very good to know that people are still making real Music these days. I am a big fan of Steve Ray. Los Lonely Boys sound resemble SRV. However, it has such a uniqueness to it that I can't explain with words. You gotta listen to them. The harmony/partition that the band members have just blows me away. If you love guitar/drums/bass, you would reach nirvana when you listen to this album. Great Work Los Lonely Boys. Keep it rocking!"
4,One Hell of a Debut,"Definitely Grammy material. I come back to Austin from Hawaii and what do I find? Los Lonely Boys! My goodness braddas, can y'all possibly kick more ass on a debut album?Los Lobos can now rest a little easier. They're still the kings, but now they can get on with being elder statesmen. The Brothers Garza have a few more albums to go before they match the accomplishments of Los Lobos, of course, (especially their understanding of a fuller diversity of Latin American sounds, not just those of Texas and the greater Southwest) but this is a very fine start.An absolutely airtight, rock-solid debut from start to finish."
5,TexMex Flavor & More,"Okay, I heard the song ""Heaven"", and honestly, I thought this group was a reggae band. I just happened to see these guys on the televised 2005 Grammies last night and was very impressed. These guys have a hint of everything from TexMex, Reggae, R&B, Country and some Classic Rock (can you hear Santana in there somewhere)which makes for this a very versatile cd. This is why they won the Grammy. There is something for everyone in this cd, even for the younger people. You can also sing along in Spanish which makes it a great bi-lingual cd as well. What a gem Willie Nelson and BB King and all the others found in this band. They definitely have an ear for music and does Los Lonely Boys"
5,Love the acoustics.............,"The Lonely Boys have a style of music I have been waiting for! This is the best group I have heard in years! They are Texas Boys that make me, feel proud to be a Texan and Hispanic all at one time! I like the combination of spanish and english words in the songs and the feel of the acoustics in the music. A little bit of Santana rythim,a little bit of Stevie Ray Vaughn rythim, and the groups own style just puts the icing on the cake! Finally! Finally! is the word that I have said since I brought the cd. I enjoye it everytime I play the cd. And so far people that I come across have told me ""who are those guys"" I proudly say ""The Lonely Boys! They are from Texas and the video HEAVEN on VH1- is now in the top 10 video."
1,A good beginning.,"I like this album, and think these guys have a long career ahead of them. I am usually not a fan of Tex-Mex, this group is the exception that made me take notice. I saw a cut on a television ad, listened to it a couple more times on a service, and decided to get the album."
5,future grammy winners,"Having been a fan of new music all my life, this band is a new original version of latin and SRV. I hope this is only the begining of this band and can't wait to see them perform in person."
5,"RUN, DON'T WALK, TO BUY THIS CD!","I just happened to catch part of a commercial for this CD on TV, liked the sound, and picked up the CD within days. NOT a letdown! As several other reviewers have said, they have a very different sound, with shades of Santana mixed in. A mellow yet energetic sound, if that makes sense. (You just have to hear it) NO ONE that I know of sounds like this. Instant gratification!Addendum: It's now July 20th, I've had this CD for over a month, and it's pretty much the ONLY thing I listen to! These guys are great, don't let the bad reviews fool you! What I love is that every song is a little different - some groups you listen to have the same sound to every song, and it gets a little boring. Not these guys! You can hear traces of a lot of different influences in their music - jazz, blues, rock, Latin, and sometimes even a little bit of 60s surfer-type music! JUST BUY IT!!"
5,They don't make 'em like this anymore,"I was driving into the Toys 'R US parking lot to pick up a birthday present when this song came on (More than love). I was mesmerized. I stayed in the car and listened--a few more songs came on, all it seemed from the same artist. After the four song set the band was unveiled to me--Los Lonely Boys. Having grown up with the gold standard in music--The Allman Brothers, Hendnrix, the Doors, Derek and the Dominos, Boz Scaggs' First album--I thought the days of fresh, clean guitar work and tuneful songs were a thing of the past. No longer. These guys are terrific. Will they ever be compared to the greats gone by? Probably not. But if you're looking for a great album from start to finish to listen to in the warm days ahead, get this disc."
5,Los Lonely Boys,"Yo, like I'm over here in Iraq fighting against terrorism and this song Heaven hits really close. It's the hottest song going that's played on Armed Forces Radio, and it is enjoyed by all, regardless of what their music preference is. It's like our anthem. This is my second tour in Iraq and I've seen, heard and lived it all, and I know when Hollywood starts filming a movie about this war, that they'll include this song in the soundtrack."
5,One of Texas' best.,"One of the few cd's I will listen to beginning to end. Great music. If you don't think it's your style, think again. The first single ""Heaven"" is just a taste of what these talented brothers can do. Give it a try and you won't want to give it back!"
4,"Very, Very Good","Not perfect, but still a very good album. The group's sound is a breath of fresh air compared to what we hear on Top 40 radio. There is an easygoing quality about the songs on this CD...they don't force the music to fit a certain style, instead, they seem to let it happen naturally. And it works. I would give this album 5 stars, but my only complaint is that the lyrics are uninspired on some tracks. But with grooves this good, you won't notice anyway."
5,Saw them at the Willie concert,"I saw these guys at the Willie concert last night and immediately had to find their album. They're an amazingly tight ""band of brothers"" who deliver a powerful syncapated rock sound, that to my ear sounds rooted in some weird combination of Stevie Ray Vaughn, the Everly's, and the Beatles. Fabulous rock and roll!!!"
5,LLB are the BEST!,"The music, the harmonies. It's a CD that you can just sit back and listen to or sing along with. These guys can get you rockin' or get you dreamin'.I love this CD!"
4,INCREDIBLY GIFTED MUSICIANS,"I just saw these guys live last night in San Antonio. As good as the CD is, it doesn't do justice to their incredible musical talent. I can't remember ever seeing a guitarist as gifted as Henry Garza. The Dave Matthews Band is my favorite live act, but Los Lonely Boys are not far behind. The same passion and intensity that Dave brings to his live performances are present when Henry Garza plays. I found myself mesmerized watching him play; it was truly spectacular."
4,Holding back on the 5th star until I see if they sell out...,"This one is probably the best CD I've heard all year - it's orignal for sure, but it sounds a lot like Stevie Ray Vaughn, ZZ Top (the older stuff) and Santana all combined forces. Really os a very listenable CD, to be sure.Best songs (IMHO) are Nobody Else, Dime Mi Amor, and Real Emotions. I was very pleasantly surprised to see that ""Heaven"", good as it is, is not even close to being the best track on the CD.Well worth the money, and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I am afraid their fame and pressure from the record company might make this one a hard act to follow. If they can equal or top this effort on their sophmore CD, I'll be very, very pleased."
5,This is truly AWESOME music!,"Run, do not walk, or in this case - click to your online shopping cart to purchase this cd. It is one of the best cd's I've bought all year. The music is fresh yet has some of the greatest guitar work I've heard in years - not since the late great Stevie Ray Vaughan and the always terrific Carlos Santana. The brothers Garza are really a tight sounding trio. I was very impressed at their first effort on this cd. I can't wait to hear more out of this trio. I'll have to admit that these guys do the state of Texas mighty proud!!"
5,"Soul, grit, and seething guitar...","I've needed an album that will grab me by the hair, throw my face into the bumper of a parked '76 Ford pick up, and fracture a mouthful of teeth. Now I have it and it is worth every last cent of the dentist's bill.... AWESOME!"
5,Great Sound,"I just saw this band as the first of two opening acts for Blues Traveler. The other opener was the Robin Ford Band. If you like the album, AND YOU WILL, you have got to see these guys live. 5 Stars for the Album, 10 Stars for the performance!!! They were definitely the top band on stage that night. I was there to see Robin and John who both have great bands but these guys blew them away."
4,These Guys Are Great!,"I have the CD and the DVD and I saw them live at the Fillmore in SF. These guys are great. I love their family style of joking around with each other and their music. They are very charming. Though many of their licks are recycled, they exibit professional quality, especially in there abilty to sing and there solid back bone of bass and drums; they really can rock the house. I really dig the Spanglish lyrics too. I hope they continue their hard work and improvement. They have a lot to offer; another good thang come outta Tejas. Los Lonely Boys is a wonderful thang. God bless them."
1,comparisons to Santana and SRV are a shame...,"These guys are soooo cheesy it is shameful to compare them to greats like Stevie Ray Vaughn and Santana. Los Lonely Boys are about as soulful as Amy Grant. In case that dopey name wasn't enough of a clue. Cheesy, cheesy, over-produced, garden variety pop. An occassional wah guitar does not make this gook creative, or interesting, and the occasional lyric in spanish is the extent of the ""spanish influence"". This is like the kind of watered down pop that graced VH1 in the 80's. Sounds like it should be background music at a supermarket."
3,Somebody shoot my room mate PLEASE!,"I haven't heard this album but I can tell you one thing if my room mate plays that damn heaven song again I'm going to crack his skull open. He always does this stupid thing were he plays songs OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN! It could make any good song suck! AHHHHHHH somebody punch my room mate in the face and spit on him, I hate him sooooo much!"
2,Sounds like Ricky Martin,"I bought the cd because of the grammy nominations, man am I dissapointed. I know Ricky Martin's producer produced this cd, but was it necessary to make ALL the back vocals sound like Ricky Martin?? After the first song, I though ""it was ok"" then after 2 or 3 songs I got tired of the same back vocals.I give it 2 stars, just because the sound quality is really good.I probably should have just used the money to put gas in my car instead of buying this cd."
4,Okay...,"I bought this C-D because of ""Heavan"". That is my favorite song of all. And they won a grammy because of ""Heavan."" Grammy's-not the case. Here is why I rate it 4 stars.Just because some of the songs have some Spanish titles and words. Spanish is okay, but I am in america, I wanna hear American songs.I would recomend the Los Lonely Boys to anybody. OVERALL RATING: Songs: 4 stars. People: 5 stars. Insterments: 5 stars. Buy this C-D TODAY"
2,NOT QUITE WHAT I EXPECTED,I must say that I thought these sandals woulod be a bit sturdier than they were. They seemed to be kind of flimsy and it was very difficult adjusting the loop to your correct size because the loop was very small. They just seemed to be very cheaply made. I'm just glad that I didn't pay full price!
4,Good debut,"Good prog metal album. Nothing new or innovative, besides some nice jazzy passages, but overall excellent execution. The singer's voice is ok but the high screams are a little bit annoying. The production and mix are great too, nice work by Tommy Hansen.The one thing that this album really lacks is in the quality of the booklet and inserts. First of all, the booklet is not well cut, it is too short and doesnt hold in the case. The design itself is bad and the impression looks like a color copy made on a home printer. If I didnt get it from Amazon I would have thought it was an illegal copy."
4,Barbarian Lovers still sound good,"Barbarian Lovers make music that stands the test of time, because these songs sounds as good as they did a long time ago. This album also includes the song ""Brother Louie."" I had heard this song in the 80's and saw it appear on several compilation albums in the 90's but couldn't place where the song came from since it did not appear on the original version of ""The Fatal Embrace"". Words fail to clearly express the sheer beauty and impact of the album ""Dancing in Dreams"". Not all the music is as dark and moody as the album cover would lead you to believe."
5,Cool retro and modern at the same time,"I discover this band through a bonus track I got on a Spicehouse CD. After listening to a few downloads, I got here. I went ahead and bought the whole album. I must say every song is winner, no filler at all. Under Your Spell and Words in the Wind are my favorite tracks from the album.I see why everyone says this is an undiscovered gem of an album. I like music that is unique and this, surely, is. It is kind of Cool retro and modern at the same time. This album was light years ahead of its time. This is one of the best albums I have gotten in a long time."
3,"heart in right place, execution a little off","first off, the connections being made that brought me to this album, i was lead to believe it was an 80's album.that being said, upon first listen the songs have the right sound to them, if a little too miami sound machine and nu shooz for me(lol).i guess the only thing that brings it down for me is the vocals, that style, while suited for st. etienne or dubstar, for this kind of music that pitch perfect singing leaves alot to be desired. then she goes off key from time to time as well.but the music's nice enough, it might grow on me, but the vocals will surely not."
1,RENT DONT BUY,I LOVE PAMELA ANDERSON. I LOVE DENISE RICHARDS. I DID NOT LOVE THIS MOVIE AT ALL. IVE BEEN WANTING TO SEE THIS MOVIE SINCE I HEARD ABOUT IT BEING MADE BUT I WAS REALLY LET DOWN. BOTH ACTRESSES LOOK AMAZING BUT THE SCRIPT IS HORRIBLE AND THE LAUGHS CAN NOT BE FOUND ANYWHERE. MY SUGGESTION IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE IT--RENT IT DONT BUY IT!!!! TRUST ME--I BOUGHT IT AND I WANT MY MONEY BACK
1,Oh well so so Movie,Poor Denise Richards and now deceased Pam Anderson. They give stilted acting in a goofy plot where they are mistaken for a killer by Police and Mob. Lots of cleavage and dumbness by especially Pam Anderson made no sense as they ultimately got much smarter to prevail. A really goofy movie.Not really recommended.
1,No wonder why I only paid $4 for this movie....,"Because it sucked! I just really don't know how to explain this movie besides that it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Not only does this movie give you a major headache, it makes you feel just as stupid as them for even watching it! These girls have no acting abilities whatsoever! Between Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards, Denise would have the most acting ability but that's only if I had to pick. They basically just float across the screen and pretend to be dumb. When people say this movie is actually funny.....its not! It's just another hour and a half that I'm never going to have again. I honestly think it killed some brain cells. Stay far back from this movie as you can."
3,if ya gotta have something by these girls,It was a gift I got for someone else who likes these two blondes. arrived promptly in condition advertised.
1,Horrible!,"Truly terrible movie and i just cannot justify any reason why you would want to waste your time with this film, and like the last line of the film says ""we are going to need some rope and duct tape"" for the director and all his staff !!!"
3,Light entertainment,"This a readable fantasy novel, but one which is lacking in any complex human emotions. The main conflict of the story is quickly resolved, with little resistance on either side, and turns out anyway to have been little more than a misunderstanding. The protagonist's two lovers feel no jealousy of each other, and she seems to feel no particular passion for either of them (despite the rather juvenile banter between herself and the father of her child), nor any conflict about her relationships with them. Two of the major villains swiftly and conveniently dispatch themselves from the scene and the third is compassionately but unconvincingly rehabilitated, while the minor villains retreat to the background. The warriors have a very PC distaste for violence, and the only evidence of any prejudice throughout the book takes the form of superstition towards supernatural forces. An entertaining read, but not one that resonates with any greater meaning."
5,You won't be able to put it down.....,"Sing the Four Quarters was a very original book, that I greatly enjoyed. Annice, a former princess, has the gift to summon the spirits of the elements earth, water, fire, and air...so she becomes a bard. Now Annice flees from two counts of treason to avoid being executed by the king...her brother. Once you pick it up and start reading you will not beable to put it down untill you finish it! I also suggest it's sequal The Fifth Quarter..it introduces totally new characters and is almost as good as Sing the Four Quarters."
5,I stayed up half the night to finish this book !!,Tonya Huff's Sing the Four Quarters is a breath of fresh air amidst all the garbage predominant in fantasy novels these days. She has done a remarkable job of bringing to life a magical world of music and elemental magic without any of the stale formulaic trite so often found in the fantasy genre. It was well worth the price of the triple latte I had to buy the next morning to stay awake
3,All or nothing,"As an individual story, the first book in the series is unimpressive, but combining the 4, they were enjoyable. Not Mr. Daley's best, in my opinion, but still well worth reading. I enjoyed the several stories competing for attention."
4,"Rich, complicated, eerie, stuff. Great story w/ potential.","This is a very complex story with a lot of characters. It's not obvious after reading the first novel what the ""point"" of all this is. However, it's clear that this first book is setting up a very involved story involving a number of different human groups and one hopes, aliens.Standing on its own feet, it's not an especially great story. But one hopes that the follow-up stories pull all the various pieces together into a cohesive unit."
2,"A hard read, but worthwhile",This book is hard to read. It has too many characters and sub-plots. The author jumps from character to character trying to develop the variuos sub-plots. For those who can manage to trod through this book volume II of Gammalaw series will be rewarding!
1,Empty Rhetoric,"Though it is clearly well researched, the book falls short in numerous ways. It is repetitve and fails to capture the essence of the orators within."
3,double the sticks-double the techniques,"While this dvd focuses on double stick fighting, there are differences in the over all techniques that one may be familiar with. 1. The patterns (stepping) seem more linear than circular. 2.The reverse grip is unusual but may be a bit difficult to pull off and maintain during a fast skirmish. 3. The attack drills are ""one step."" However, the exercises and stances are very viable. The explanation of power and twisting are clear. As with all Turtle Press products, the menus are very helpful and easy to navigate. If you have a working knowledge of stick fighting, this dvd may be able to supplement your technique."
3,"Good, but the previous stick fighting discs are better","There is less emphasis on individual techniques applied against opponents on this disc-- I mean less than Sang Kim's previous single stick fighting DVD'sBut, I am definitely a fan of Sang Kim's other discs. His open hand fighting disc and those beginner and intermediate stick fighting discs are awesome. They are full of applications for real fights-- things you could practice with a partner to learn real self defense. As far as I am concerned, this disc is good but Mr. Kim's other discs are very great."
4,Magic Tricks that really work plus a story,"As a parent this video gave me a whole day of things to do.First we watched the tape. The kids were rapt with attention.Then we tried out the magic tricks that are taught inside the tape.We kept going back to the dvd to see if we were doing them the right way.This video has 5 or 6 really good magic tricks that this magician teaches you. It's not corny stuff.Plus, there's a wacky and wild storyline about a kid who helps a good hearted wizard defeat evil.My kids ate it up.For the price this is definitely worth it for the tricks alone.Try it."
3,"It is a Tee shirt, what can I say.",This is tee shirt bought for a young friend. It has a photo of a dog on the front. Looks nice.
1,Not the real story of Flynn,"What a shame this film is....It's really too bad because the actual story of Flynn's early days would have made for a great film. Just as in the picture Flynn was in real life a big time womanizer, cad, and outrageous adventurer. But the sequences in this film are almost all totally false and the ones based on reality are way off base from what actually happened. Why on earth did they even bother when the real stories would have been just as scandalous and outrageous? Sadly, fans looking for the real story of the early days of Errol Flynn will have to wait...This film is a major disappointment and not historically accurate at all."
4,Models,This book had a good deal of information for the newer modeler as well as those who have been in the hobby for a while. Most of my RR modeling has been of the 20's thru the 50's so I found the book very interesting but would have liked some more on rolling stock of the period.
2,These are for small hands,"Note the dimensions: 0.8 x 3 x 7.2 inchesMy hand is the the size of these shears. I'll use it because I have it but for repetitive work, I'll buy something else. Probably Felco."
2,weak pivot screw,"I was initially very impressed with these shears and quickly bought two additional pairs. After about two months of regular use the plastic nut that the pivot screw goes into would not stay adjusted letting the shears become loose and useless. Fiskars has had a reputation of being the leader in quality scissors and shears and I have to say I am very disappointed with these units. I hope to get in touch with their customer service dept. (if they have one) and acquire replacement units, however the plastic pivot nut is a bad manufacturing flaw that needs to be addressed."
4,Nice bag,"It's a nice bag but it is not waterproof. I rode in the rain for 1 1/2 hours and the stuff inside was wet. It is kind of small. It will hold my camera, small binoculars, mp3 player and not to much more. But I like how it attaches with straps. And I mounted the bag facing me on the handlebars, not out in front over the tire. Because I have a good rain suit and will be riding in all types of weather I'm gonna find me something a little bigger and waterproof. It won't go to waste as my girlfriend will use it. It's pretty good quality zipper and the front has a mesh pocket on the outside if I'm using my MP3 player and my shirt doesn't have a pocket in it I put it in this pocket, along with my garage door opener. It's good looking because I've noticed people looking at it on my bike. It's about 9.5"" wide on top 5.5"" wide on the bottom, 3"" deep and 8"" high."
5,Very functional,Just the right size for my needs. I keep it mounted on the handlebars facing me. Plenty of zippered compartments and little pockets to keep things organized. I like have some things accessible without having to dismount. Good quality construction. No problems with zippers. Has shoulder strap if you want to take it with you when you stop.
4,Nice compact pack,"I needed a small, easily attached pack to place on my wife's mountain bike. This fits the bill. There's room for a wallet, snack, keys, cellphone, etc. The cost was reasonable. It seems fairly well made."
2,Decent bag with zero water resistance,"I live in South Florida and so waterproof stuff is very important to me. Now I realize that this bag is listed as water resistant and not waterproof but I got caught in a minor rain storm. when I checked the contents of the bag I was dismayed to discover that not only had it completely failed to keep water out but it had actually retained the water that got in in a small puddle at the bottom of the bag. as a result of this, my smartphone was completely ruined and I had to get it replaced under warranty for 130 dollars. I know this shouldn't be expected to completely keep water out but riding a bike outdoors carries the inherent risk of rain and this item is listed as weather resistant. As far as I am concerned its complete inability to keep out moisture makes it nothing more than a waste of money."
4,A good bar bag for the price,"I've used this bag extensively around town, on club rides and touring trips. This bag has been the perfect size to keep my wallet, phone, camera and assorted stuff within easy reach. It also comes with a shoulder strap for off-bike ventures. It's about the size of a mid-sized camera bag so (for guys) it doesn't look too much like a purse. Works for me..."
4,Good for recumbent trike,Own a Catrike recumbent trike.Attached bag to front left side crossmember with HD wire ties.Works well but is not waterproof.I carry a small trash bag in case.Holds a fair amount.Good value.
1,Very Disappointing,"That movie is crap. Obviously it's not from Indigo Entertainment but from Surrender Cinema. The graphic is incredibly poor and the scenes are very plain and flat, I mean not spicy at all. You can tell that the actors are overacting which is not natural at all. The plot itself is stupid, involving several men/women meeting up in a resort, and having sex with each other. No pink shots or close-ups (like you would expect from previous Playboy movies) or full frontal or rear nudity scenes. I have also seen ""Castle Erotica"" from the same studio, and it is as disappointing as this one. I would definitely not recommend this one. I believe the same movie would have been heaps different if it were from Indigo Entertainment (another subsidiary of Playboy Entertainment Group)."
1,Even the UNRATED version is lame.......,"The first two reviewers of this movie said it best so I won't repeat them. Sometimes with a film like this you need to get the unrated version to enjoy it. Not here. I know I got the unrated one because the run time is 15 minutes longer than the rated cable version. I'm not a big fan of ""pink shots"" or closeups of anything. I do like to be able to hear the gals ""goin at it"" so to speak. You can't here. Nothing but loud, unimaginative music can be heard during the sex. The only good thing I can say about this movie is, if you catch the rated version on showtime or somewhere else, go ahead and watch it. You're not missing anything good from the deleted 15 minutes."
4,LET'S GO TO MARS,"The mastermind behind this movie brings you one great tale about a trip to Mars. It is told like no other. I saw both ""Lost on Mars"" and the sequel ""Empire of Danger"". I will be giving my comments on ""Empire of Danger"" later. In my opinion, the best actors in the movie were David Long, John T. Oertling, Eric E. Shook and Meagan Glosser. Kelli Wilson, one of the leads in this movie, did a so-so job. I couldn't help thinking, though, that I was watching one of the munchkins from ""The Wizard of Oz"". It was just hard for me to believe that she was a great warrior when she is such a short person. They should have stood her on a vegetable crate. That would have made it more believable. Other than that, I still give this movie a thumbs up.Mat"
1,I wish I could give it no stars,"There are easily more than 1,000 adjectives to describe the worthlessness that is Lost On Mars. Unfortunately, I am limited to 1,000 words. I can only say this: If it were any longer, viewers would most definitely go insane. John T. Oertling is the only saving grace this movie presents. We wish this movie had been ""Lost On Mars"" and never found."
1,I wish I could give this movie no stars,"There are more than 1,000 adjectives I could use to describe the worthlessness that is Lost On Mars. Unfortunately, I am limited to 1,000 words. Lost on Mars is, perhaps, the worst example of cinema the world has ever seen. The only saving grace is the shining appearance of Mr. John T. Oertling. When all is said and done, I wish this movie really had been ""Lost On Mars"" and never found."
4,Two Thumbs Up,"As I watched Lost on Mars for the first time, I thought to myself that this is going to be a silly movie. As it went on, and I started to understand the story a little better, I got quite involved. The story really picks up once they crash on Mars and meet up with the Siperion Empire. I've seen several science fiction movies about Mars. The ones I have seen, were pretty boring because once they got to Mars, there was nothing really to do except walk around a pick up rocks. Lost on Mars is nothing like that. It has a story, action, romance and a lot of entertainment compared to watching astronauts pick up rocks while sand blows in their faces. There were a couple of scenes that I could have definetly left behind. But, overall, I enjoyed it. Directed by Eric Shook Actors: Kelli Wilson, Megan Glosser, David Long, Gretchen Maxwell."
5,BSC rules!,...The kids aren't always good.if you've ever read #59 you would know that.The girls do get bad hair days. The only reason the BSC is always thirteen is because people won't read the books if they were twenty or something.I have about 100 BSC books and I say they rule!
4,I don't agree with Mrs. Shafer/Spier,"Mrs. Shafer/Spier, Dawn's mom, should have a baby because Kristy is a whiney brat. What that has to do with it is I hate Kristy because she's concieted and is always jealous of MA and Dawn being stepsisters and closer than she and MA are. Therefore, I like reading about her babyishness, if that makes sense. If Mrs. Shafer/Spier had a baby,Kristy would be even more jealous! Dawn and Mary Anne would have a new cuddly, cute sib to take care of, and Kristy would be left bawling!"
4,It does what you think it does,"I have a couple shop vacs in the shop and garage so I'm familiar with their quality. I got this one to walk around the house and clean out the corners; along the side of the fridge; around the fireplace etc. Works great. Picks up little wood chunks around the fireplace just like a shop-vac should - not like an upright which requires major surgery when it breaths in such things. Not as noisy as an upright hoover. The fifty foot cord is more than enough and you really can walk around the house comfortably with the thing on your back. It uses throw-away bags and so far, I haven't been able to find a source (including the shop-vac web site). Assume those will be available soon."
2,Not very powerful,"We bought three of the these to replace the bigger clunky ones we had, but when we programmed them they didn't seem to work as well as the bigger ones. You practically have to be standing next to the gate to get it to open and that's after having pressed the button several times. They're nice sized but that's about it."
5,Good Textbook,Reached me in time (Amazon Prime) in excellent condition. This book is perfect for all those who are beginners in Web Designing. Five stars. No Fault!
5,Excellent non-beginner book,"For years I have been doing sporadic web work, but I recently started a job that required a lot more. I picked this book based on a few reviews, and it was the perfect resource. It works as a reference book, but a lot of it is so well written that I found myself reading whole chapters just because I got ""sucked in""."
3,"NOT 4"" as stated...","This is not 4"" diameter as stated in the technical details. It measures about 3 1/4"" across. I need to look at how it will fit my grinder, and how usable it will be. I'm guessing the guard will be in the way a bit.The shipping was slower than expected. (Monday to the following Tuesday) Acehardwareoutlet took their time (3 days) to get it shipped out. For an 8oz envelope getting the low priority treatment, $6.63 seems steep."
1,I got Cheated,"I ordered this thinking the box contained the pads. It might be my mistake in thinking there were at least a few pads in the ""box."" However, there is NO box. I got one stinking little pad. That's it! The picture is deceptive and I will nor order from this company again."
5,Prettier than expected,"Contrary to another reviewer here, my screen came well-packaged. My master bedroom does not have its own door; it shares a door with the hallway that leads to the master bath. The hallway also houses a closet that is shared. I bought the screen for privacy purposes. Works great. It is lightweight, which is good for me due to back problems. It was a little taller than I expected, but I like that. I wish they had one with a brown stain (instead of black). If so, I'd buy another one for the living room to hide my all-in-one printer. Even though the shipping cost isn't covered by Amazon, it was still at least $25-$40 cheaper than other websites, even with shipping."
2,arrived damaged,"The box was fragile cardboard with many rips. 2 of the 3 panels were damaged. Don't expect fine artwork on the panels - the printing is a bit gray, which makes it look a bit cheesy. Nice frames and 2-way hinges on the panels."
2,sox mailbox cover,"was disappointed - the advertisement said a ""flag"" came with product and it wasn't there.cheaply made - not worth the money. Saw the same product elsewhere for $5.00"
4,good book,"this book is nice....there are so manythings covered there....that it is notpossible for the author to go too deep intosolution of the wave equation itself...i wouldhave loved a better introduction to the fieldequations...something i found surprisin giventhat it is a book in EM.But, even if you can catch up and apply afew of the concepts that he lays out for youin the book you have learnt something. and thebook is a worthy buy."
3,Watch for Ruth Gordon,"Both movies had their good parts, but the first one was great due to the performance of Ruth Gordon, a great classic actress. The second movie was a poor viewing as Winters just didn't show a good performance."
5,Write Start Pencils are the Best!!,We love using these pencils for our Early Writers! They are anti roll so we don't have any concerns about them constantly rolling off the tables. The grip is just the right size for little hands!! We have had zero breakage of pencil itself which prohibits replacing pencils regularly!! We wouldn't purchase any other kind!!!
1,BAIT AND SWITCH!!! BEWARE,"THIS IS NOT NO DOUBT. Like the other guy i was in the cds section and clicked 'buy mp3 album' and..... what do you know, not the same album."
1,Where in the world is Harvey Keittel ?,"This movie is so pathetic - I mean every and single aspect of it: directing, plot, play, everything - that it does not deserve to be dignified even with a negative response.It does deserve however a question: how do good actors like Mr. Keittel end up in this pile of non-sense ? Is he a relative of the director and was doing him a litle favor ? Does he need money so bad ? Does he not have any taste whatsoever ? No answer... Silentio..."
1,Poor acting,"This movie, unreleased to theatres, has been sitting on shelf for several years. Main problem is the acting especially that of Brad Rowe, that is very poor."
3,Fun!,"I liked this movie. From what I've heard, a lot of people feel that it's a poor man's Fast and the Furious, but I think it held up in its own right. The story follows two brothers--one who has recently been saved, and one who is not. Both brothers used to be street racers, but after his conversion the Christian brother feels he should not race anymore. When he forgoes his faith to race just one more time, the story accelerates into a surprise ending. Definitely worth the price of a rental!"
1,Disappointing,"Bought this movie based because it was advertised ""best youth film,"" but I was too ashamed of it to let anybody else watch it. I thought it was terrible."
5,Fiskars 99216981 Softouch Micro-Tip Pruning Snip,"These are great, sturdy and durable. Good for house plants as well."
4,Good quality Fiskars scissors.,I always trust the sharpness and action of Fiskars scissors. They are easily the best I've found at a reasonable price.
5,Had these for a while now!....,"I have to say,I was a little worried that either the spring was going to go,or just something was going to happen to these perfectly priced trimmers.And after using these lil guys off n on for several months now,these things are worth thier weight in gold,I tell ya.LOL!Comfy,sharp and easy to clean as well.Excellent price and an even BETTER deal."
5,Great for deadheading annuals and trimming marijuana,"I'm a landscaper, so I use these snips for deadheading fussy annuals like violas and petunias.But I used to work at a Humboldt County, CA nursery, and, um... I was probably the only person ever to buy a pair of these for legal purposes! Seriously, this is the gold standard for pot-growers who need to do trimming. What kind of trimming? Durn if I know, but I've seen them at yard sales coated with the sticky sap, and the local growers used to buy stacks of these nippers with their smelly cash, so...If you need it for either purpose, then these are the best. I've tried other brands and didn't like them as well. Keep in mind this is for cutting thin, tiny deadheads. It's not a pruning shear, it's for very detailed deadheading or nipping of very small stems.If you're doing a lot of delicate pruning like this, I'd also recommend picking up some of those thin Atlas Nitrile Touch gloves. Best gloves for tactile sensation while doing fine work."
3,Awesome detail pruning snips! However...,"I will start this review by saying that these snips are nearly perfect for detail trimming and pruning (to those complaining that these aren't made for pruning large branches, perhaps ""Micro-Tip"" should have tipped you off). They are much easier to work with than regular scissors and have a very fine point for accessing hard-to-reach leaves. So why do I rate them only 3 stars? Because they are identical (literally) to the Fiskars soft touch scissors which are $2.00 cheaper [...]I ordered one of each thinking that the scissors were slightly larger (they aren't). The only difference between these two items is the packaging and the fact that the pruning snips come with a small piece of plastic to be used for covering the sharp tip while not in use; a piece of plastic which I already managed to lose.Overall, wonderful product for its intended purpose, but save yourself two bucks and get the scissors."
5,A long-lasting bargain!,"Received these small, light snippers by Fiskars as a gift years ago, and would have never guessed that they would still be serviceable years later. They have proven to be far more rugged than expected, and though showing their age now, the stainless steel blades have maintained a surprising amount of sharpness.Must note that it's the handles of these things that are the best part. The cushioned grips are more ergonomic and better designed for comfort than so many gardening snippers and cutters. Add to that, they're actually ambidextrous... left-handed people who pick up mine are amazed how well they fit the hand. And the blades have a convenient lock, one that actually works.Have never had small snippers last as long as these. Will probably have to replace them in the next year or so, but as they've been so reliable and since the price is so good, won't even think twice about it. Giving them 5-stars for quality, versatility, longevity and price."
5,3 years strong,"Great tool. Perfect for pruning an herb garden, flowers, and small growth up to about 1/4"". Holds up well to abuse."
4,It's more petite than I expected.,"I had to go with 4 stars because Amazon stated it was 7-inches long in the description but it's only 6-inches. I checked the Fiskars Website and they show it correctly at approximately 6"" in length... but it's exactly that length and the cutting edge is 2"". I have a large hand and the length does make a difference for me and I kept pushing the locking lever closed because my hand covers it and my thumb pushes the latch forward. I did trim some lilac bushes with it and it's pretty easy to use, feels the same in either the left or right hand and is quite sharp. However, since I have about 30 more bushes to go I'm going with the larger pairFiskars 9920 Garden Multi-Snip with Sheathand these will fit much better in my wife's much smaller hand. If you have a small hand they you'll likely be going with 5 stars because I can't find any other issue with it."
2,Spring needs to be redesigned,The little spring that pushes the handles apart sometimes falls off. I have always been able to find it EXCEPT this time. The spring should be attached better so it won't fall off.
5,Super Sharp,"I bought these to trim my plants after harvest. They are by far the sharpest scissors I have ever owned. I poked my thumb with the tip and it hurt, so don't do that :) They also cut through leaves and branches like a hot knife through butter. I have never used a scissor without holes to put your fingers and thumb through, so they feel a little awkward for me. They are also much smaller than I expected, but that makes them very precise. I am a tall guy with large hands, so the size may be better for smaller people. Anyway, they seem to be quite effective and the spring is convenient and had no problem popping the scissors open after each snip even after the blades starts to get a little sticky.Update: After using these for a couple of days on my harvest they have become like a second very sharp hand. The lack of holes for my fingers doesn't matter any more and they are just as precise and sharp as can be. I love them and will be ordering a second set."
1,the lock/unlock slide pinches hand,"the lock/unlock slide, pinches hand between the slide lock and against the other handle (the lock slide stays attached to one side, sliding up and down, and it pinches skin against the other handle when using cutters wheither the slide is in lock or unlock mode, it pinches in either position when cutting or pruning). they are not as sharp as other brands either. just not a commercial or 'use on a regular basis' type of product. the pinching will make you throw them in the garbage, the cutting is actually not too bad, but i only use these for emergency, when i can't find my other pair."
3,Micro tip Pruning Snip,"Haven't tried them yet, but would suggest instead of black handles, colored handles, so if you lose them they are easy to find!"
1,won't hold up to very much pressure,The first time I used these pruning snips I tried to cut a branch the size of pencil and the handle broke. They were really not worth fooling with so I throwed them in the garbage. If you buy any pruning snips be sure you get the heavy duty ones. The handles on these snips are plastic. Take my advice they're not worth what it costs to ship them.
4,Pretty good for light duty,"I read all the reviews, hoping to find experience with Houseplants, but there seems to be very few comments about that. That is the 'only' use I wanted, I dont do any gardening outdoors. After receiving and using them on my houseplants, they seem fine for soft plants, and cutting old flowers or leaves off. They are very small, I would never use them for any plant as tough as a Rose stem."
3,Sharp!!! Short!!!,"Love 'em with one exception. The blades are VERY short. These are probably the shortest snips I've ever used. However, the fact they're extremely sharp AND I have rose gloves means getting a little closer to the danger of getting ""thorned"" isn't quite as dangerous as it could be."
5,Great Snips for your herb,Great durable product thats extremely light and comfortable. The thin sharp blades allow a close precise cut at the stem. Very Happy with the purchase.
4,Very good small pruner,This is just the right size for dead-heading flowers and pruning small diameter branches. I use it all the time
2,"Too small, never found a use for them","I bought these for my wife for trimming store bought flowers and garden flower gathering. She hated them. Not even useful for roses. Maybe right size for precise bonsai type work, but too flimsy. Waste of money. Get a pair of Felco 300's for a couple bucks more."
1,fiskars trimmer,The trimmer is sharp but the big down fall is that stupid orange clip. It constantly catches. and the blades would be nicer if they had a small curve to them
3,Rubber tip cover,This is not as good as a bigger pruning snipper. It feels small in your hand. I wish there was a place to put the tip cover when in use.
1,"Worked well until Blade Broke, so now Useless Junk","This pruning snip worked well for a few weeks of light use until one of the blades completely broke off from the base. At first I thought the blade somehow came loose, but on closer inspection the actual blade had snapped off around its base.I wasn't using it for anything else but cutting some thin plant stems, so maybe the quality of the blade just wasn't good or was a defective item."
2,they don't make 'em like they used to ...,"I've used these Fiskars micro-tip snippers for over ten years.Back in the day, the handles were darker gray in color and they lasted a long time.Ever since they started making them with lighter gray handles with a more pronounced stipple grip, the quality has deteriorated. The spring in the middle is now a very flimsy plastic, which breaks after prolonged use. I'm not positive if the older pruners had a metal spring instead of plastic, but I do know that the older version of these lasted 3 - 4x longer. The springs break on the newer types after a month or two of use.There are more heavy duty types of these snippers available, but I always preferred the Fiskars brand due to them being ultra light-weight."
4,Exactly what I was looking for,"I've been looking for a pruner for both garden and house plant. My anvil-type pruner works good on woody stems, but not on live green stems or for dead-heading flowers, etc. This is perfect for what I need. They are lightweight, small enough to fit in your pocket and even comes with a safety ""cap"". I find them extremely easy to use and very sharp! I can get in the tiniest places to trim my flowers and it's cuts are precise and clean. No more mangled stems! These pruners are not meant to cut large, woody or dead stems/stalks, but were made to cut smaller, live (green) stems and flowers. (Use a bypass or anvil pruner for the large, woody, & dead stems and stalks). When used for the purpose for which it was intended, these pruners are excellent. And very easy on the hands, as well. The only reason I give them 4 stars is because I don't give anything 5 stars! I would highly recommend them; they're a very good value for the price."
5,precise,"nice quick trim and manicure job! made my ""ganj"" look great and pretty precise cuts sometimes a little to precise ""oouch"" so be careful."
2,could have been better,"Ah, the soft, pretty bottoms of a beautiful woman's feet! What could be more exciting??? Here the girls are pretty but there is only a limited emphasis on their feet, particularly the soft soles that true foot fetishists crave to see. However, there are some quite entertaining segments."
1,Why no soles Christy???,"I am so sad with this video! I thought I bought some treasure-find, that I could really... I risked my face and big money to buy this video and after watching it I felt robbed and fooled... I didn't see much bare soles of pretty models. I am upset with this video, the title is a lie..."
2,Pretty elementary; Overpriced,"This was not a BAD reference on the subject and would certainly be helpful to someone with no previous knowledge of the subject. That said, you don't get much for your $25. More of a pamphlet, really. Only 46 of the 89 pages actually describe how to develop a corrective/preventive action program. The rest is a re-hash of team skills and basic problem-solving tools such as fishbone charts, etc. The one case history is useful but appears made-up (Acme Co.) More realistic case histories would have been a better way to fill up the pages.I admit this last point on grammar is picky, but the authors frequently confused the singular and plural forms of some nouns. They often referred to ""the team"" and ""management"" as if they were plural. They also treated the plural noun ""data"" as if it were singular (""data is--""), although this error has become so common that it is almost accepted today."
5,101 poems for the road,"This is a nice collection of poems that I like to read and reread while away and on the road. I like this edition because it is very light and inexpensive, easy to trow in the bag."
2,Meh,"Though this is a nicely priced small collection of classic poetry, I can't forgive them for publishing Dickinson's work without her original punctuation. Those changes disrupt the flow and are an affront to her work. It's like taking the entire string section out of a performance of the Blue Danube. Even so, it might be worth picking up for someone you want to introduce to a variety of poetry. I bought a copy for my elderly aunt and given the price it's not a complete loss."
4,Inspiring,I really enjoyed this alot. I felt I was transported into a world of great poems. There really wasn't a bad piece here. Indulge and buy this book.
3,"tea pot is beautiful, but they sent me expired tea.","First of i love the tea pot it's beautiful holds up well. but when i tried the tea it taste bad, i thought it was just the flavor i didn't like. 2 months later ,my dad is packing up a variety of teas to send to my sister in Dominica and i told him to send her the primula tea i didn't like. he looks at the bottom and see's it expired two freaking years ago in 2010. well no wonder the tea tasted bad. seriously did the people who distribute or even manufacture this not look at the date. if its 2012 why are you sending me tea that expired in 2010?"
1,Poor quality,The pot and infuser is made from very thin glass. No substance at all to it. The infuser was broken in the package. The lid will not fit the pot at all. It sits lopsided as only one side will go into the rim. I sent it back for a refund.
5,A perfect gift!,"I bought this for my mom and my mom-in-law and they both LOVE it! It looks great and the tea taste awesome. I'm going to order more as gifts. I hope one day, I'll get it for myself (once I'm done buying gifts = which is never)."
2,"Tea is ok, but pot is poorly made","I bought this as a gift for my husband since he loves teas. The idea of the flowering tea is nice and the flavors are fine. My main problem is with the pot. The lid just does not fit! It is deformed and constantly rattles and wobbles back and forth. It is as if the two pieces were not meant to go together. I intended to return it, but somehow lost the box. Now I am stuck with a malformed tea pot. I am sure sooner or later the lid will just fall off and break. If you want a flowering tea pot, look for a different one."
3,"Tea pot is nice, water filters slowly","So, this teapot does everything you would expect. The included flowering tea is a nice touch, more of something to show off with than for practical use. When making regular tea and using the diffuser, the slots tend to be small enough that the water filters through very slowly, yet frustratingly wide enough to allow lots of tea leaves through. I believe this to be a function of using glass instead of a wire mesh, but you are purchasing this for the look and the reduced function. Otherwise you would just have a metal diffuser in your #1 Mom coffee cup."
4,a beautiful gift,I ordered two of these flowering tea sets for Christmas gifts and I couldn't have been happier with them. The price was right and they are a fairly unique gift.It is a good sized tea pot and boxed nicely.One did arrive with a fine crack and it will have to be returned for a replacement but I anticipate no problem with that.
3,"Great pot, weak tea!","I purchased this item because it looked interesting. The pot and its components are very nice but, for me, the Green Tea with Jasmine and the Earl Grey Tea are both weak. The actual ""flowering"" of the teas is fun to watch and to share with others."
2,Infuser not useful.,"The set works well for the flowering tea pods, and for those only. The photo shows an infuser for use with loose leaf teas but it does not allow water in; there are simply a series of scratches along the base of the infuser that do not go all the way through the glass. If you wish to use this for loose leaf teas, do yourself a favor and get a good stainless steel sieve and just toss the leaves into the pot."
2,Don't waist you time and money.,"The tea ball that came with it looked neat as the expanded and tasted good. After a few months, the lid or top opening became warped making it difficult to remove. Later it a small piece cracked off. It was difficult to clean the leaves out of the infuser because it was so fragile. When I taped in on the side of the plastic trash can it cracked."
1,Poor Quality!,"I got one scratched up and with a crooked handle and glass dust everywhere.Very poor quality control!! And yeah, the tea wasexpired."
4,A very good teapot,"My sister has always wanted a teapot. So I got her the flowering tea set for Christmas, and she loved it.I would recommend it."
4,Quality Product and Good Value,This is a quality product which comes with a lot for its value. The only complaint I have is: Sometimes the included Tea doesn't flower completely.It is definitely a conversation piece and great for tea lovers!
4,flowering tea pot set,"The tea pot came in good condition and quickly. If you enjoy drinking tea, you will enjoy this set. You must boil water in a tea kettle first. Then insert the the flower bud into the infuser (looks like a glass cup)and place it into the glass pot. The infuser has small slits in it and worked just fine. Pour the hot water into the glass pot and then set back and watch the flower bloom. It only takes a few minutes before your tea is ready. Don't leave the flower or tea in too long or it will become bitter. This will make a great gift too. It really does work! The glass pot is very thin glass."
5,Flowering Tea Set,"I love this tea pot and tea. The flowering tea is absolutely beautiful, the tea tastes good, and being able to sip tea while looking at this beautiful flower is a very soothing and enriching experience. I only used it once to test it out because the weather has been very hot here but I can't wait for the cool weather to put on a pot of tea, light some candles, and cozy up to a nice fire. This will definitely be a wonderful winter ritual. I highly recommend this set."
2,leaks,"Right after opening the package, I tried brewing a tea ball. the tea was okay, tasted like regular jasmine tea and the flower was not as fancy as I expected,but that was okay too. The problem was that I noticed a small gap where the handle was attached to the teapot. I'm pretty sure it's not because of misuse because there was no damage done to the teapot. It just seems that the one I recieved was either defected or poorly made. I saw a simmilar product with simmilar price but with a thicker handle. I really want to return this but I already opened my tea package so I'll just have to deal with it. I recommend inspecting the quality of the teapot before trying your tea."
5,"Beautiful, relaxing and TASTY how could you go wrong","In addition to how beautiful the flowers are in the tea and how the whole family (my little girls included) gathered around the teapot to sea the beauty of the flower unfold, the tea was also light and tasty with a sweet note to it, i got the green tea with jasmine and I cannot tell you in words how wonderfully soothing and exquisite this teapot and tea are, it combines the essence of beauty and flavor, tradition and nourishing essences are brought together here. It's sort of cerimonial too. What a wonderful way to drink tea!"
4,It's a reasonable price combination of flowering tea and glass teapot.,Also chose this as Xmas gift for my Aunt.Bought and saw a Flowering tea few years back and was very impressed by it.Hope she liked it. It's a reasonable price combination of flowering tea and glass teapot.Recommended.
3,too fragile,"When I first received this, the tea infuser had hairline cracks in it. I don't think it was from shipping as it was relatively well packed. Since I wanted this set as a wedding gift, I returned for a replacement. The replacement was fine."
2,"Nice idea, but...","My teapot came with the entire top completely shattered, due to the way it was packed and handled on its way to me. I wish I could rate it more highly, but I never even got to use it. :( I'm going to use the refunded cost to buy a glass pot at a local store and I'll order the tea flowers separately."
1,Title of product,I am sorry im not trying to be picky but i do not understand how this con be called a tea set a tea set includes glass ware and a sampling of tea.
4,Glass tea pot,"I use this teapot regularly all winter long. I love watching my tea bloom. Also, I like the relatively large capacity--most glass pots are smaller. And it's a very pretty shape. Only difficulty: the tea flower tends to hold air, and so it rises to the top and isn't as showy as in the picture. I sometimes hold it down with a fork, but that also interferes with the effect. I'm looking for the ideal tea-flower weight."
4,Perfect gift,Bought this for my best friend for Xmas. She loved it so much she took it to work with her to show it off and share her tea. I only wish I either ordered her an additional set of the tea or more came with the set. She ran out of her tea rather quickly but it was flu season and she is an avid tea drinker so I should have expected this and purchased more. Will definitely be purchasing more of this set as gifts for other family & friends
2,Tea is great. Pot is not.,"The tea is wonderful. It's beautiful to look at and it tastes great. The pot, on the other hand is incredibly thin and fragile glass. The lid broke just by setting it on to the pot once hot water was added. I feel like I have to be far to careful with the pot than is practical because of how fragile it is."
2,It's alright,"I had order this product for Christmas and had recieved the kettle pot cracked, I'm not sure if they handled it wrong or what but it was a disappointment. Maybe it was just my luck I recieved the broken one, not sure."
2,Primule Tea Set,"It looks nice but the tea gets cold fast. I also found it dripped. Amazon sure delivered it fast as usual. I just picked the wrong teapot. If you want a decorative teapot, this is it. If you want good hot tea, this is not."
5,gift - pretty i love it,This was soooo cute! I was looking for a gift idea and found this I loved it so much i bought myself one also. Very pretty and unique idea. The person who i gave the gift to said she loved it and started using it right away she was very happy with the flowering tea pot too! Also it is an awesome price value for what you get!!! Beautiful unique gift idea!!
4,Flowering tea set,I bought this set for my sister for Christmas. She was very pleased. Said she had bought one for her daughter and thought about buying one for herself but didn't. She is one of those people who have evferything soon as it hits the market and difficult to buy for. This was a good buy.
3,Nice for the price but poor teapot design,Include loads of tea - not high quality tea but okay enough. The teapot design is a bit funky - hard not to spill tea while pouring. Does anyone make a glass teapot that stands up to everyday use and pour without dripping or spilling?
3,Too Fragile,"it was my mistake for ordering this when what I really wanted was a TEA KETTLE. I wanted something for every day use to boil water. The pot is very beautiful, it would make a great gift and its great for someone who throws tea parties. the top gets really hot when steeping water and when you pour out the tea you have to hold the top on...but its usually too hot to do so. feels easily breakable and I am a little nervous to use it. I am buying a tea kettle and keeping this for special occasions. The tea has very strong jasmine but taste it is really good and is very strong. Very beautiful to look at also. haven't tried re-steeping a flower yet but it says you can."
3,Great tea pot,"Tea pot is really really nice, however, the blooming tea was very weak. I would get the tea pot by itself and get Teavana blooming tea because its alot stronger."
2,Not packaged well,"This is theoretically a great gift. However, when I received it I noticed how little padding/packing material there was. The box with the pitcher & tea was placed in a larger box with very little packing material - maybe some brown paper, but not much. Because of this, the tea pot had broken in a couple of places. Great item, poor packaging. I re-ordered it, but not from Amazon. I re-ordered it from Bed, Bath, and Beyond - same price, MUCH better packing. The box with the tea pot & tea was wrapped in huge, puffy bubble wrap before it was placed in the larger box, and it all arrived intact. Usually I'm very satisfied with my shopping experiences on Amazon, but for this item in particular, I recommend purchasing it somewhere else!"
2,I feel cheated.,"The package arrived on time, and in good condition. It is what it says it is, a thin glass tea pot with 12 flowering teas and a useless strainer. The teas, however were dated to expire 3 days after arrival. The seller obviously bought old flowering teas from some other shop, and is attempting to resell them. I am dissatisfied, and feel cheated. Would not buy again."
5,Curtain Creek Farm stories,"CURTAIN CREEK FARM is a book that feels like it was written painstakingly, making every word count so that the words describe and illuminate each detail and every character. The book is fiction but the reader hopes this place is real! The book employs the best of fictional techniques that are also memoir techniques including character description, dialogue, storytelling. All blend compassion with a poignant appeal and enchanting metaphors and similes and leave the reader wishing to visit these at the ""edge"" of society who succeed somehow in their quiet lifestyle and even find a way to join technology with a beautiful website describing each participant. There is action in nature--floods, wolves, children born in snowy places. This book is one to treasure and re-read many times! Thanks to Nance Van Winckel for an outstanding book!"
4,Adlerian analysis of Hitler,"This book has been misnamed. Although 80% of the book presents an interesting review of Hitler's views of art and the steps he took as ""Fuehrer"" to make all of German art conform to his view, the 10% that gives a psychological analysis refers little to his view of art. Rather, it gives an analysis based on the Adlerian psychoanalytic theory. However, this is most fascinating, especially as most psychological analyses of Hitler are based on Freud's theories. This is definitely a book worth reading."
5,Great information,I used this book in a discussion group at my church. It has a lot of great information in it.
5,a good series for pre-schoolers,The Caillou series is perfect for introducing children to experiences they are likely to encounter as a toddler. The family values and situations presented in the dvd are great at highlighting positive solutions without dwelling on the negative (i.e. there are no villians that encourage bad habits). The children and religions (as represented during the winter holidays)are diverse and allow identification with various children -- both girls and boys.
5,GOT KIDS??,My granddaughters love this movie when they come over this and the other Caillou is all they want to watch
1,Broken,The CD was broken when I received it. To much trouble to return. Wish they packaged it a bit better.
5,love it,my 2 year old girl loves itno puppets & no breaks between Caillou episodeswill watch over & over again
5,Great Children's Entertainment,I purchased this DVD for my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter who is a HUGE fan of the character Caillou. The video was great entertainment at will for bringing Caillou into our home. Recommend this for an addition to your children's (age appropriate) DVD library.
3,"loved the book, but it did not come in good condition","I loved the book, it's really interactive and I bought it as a gift for a friend who is teaching her daughter Spanish. I do speak Spanish myself as a first language and I think the book is easy to follow and fun to look at.The downside is that the book did not look brand new, which I wouldn't care if I had kept it, but it was a present and I had to explain my close friend that it was new but delivered that way. Maybe, it's the shipping company's fault, but it looked well wrapped though.Good purchase!"
4,Great product,"I have been using this planner for years, it's the perfect size and holds everything I need. I just keep buying the refills. The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because they don't offer variety of beautiful pictures on the pages as the other sizes. Price is a bit high for the plain and boring green and cream."
2,Definitely not vanity sizing!!!,"As far as quality for the price paid this item is great! That is, if you could actually fit into it!!! When you order Order at least 2 sizes bigger than what you would were is you wish to breathe."
2,"Review for 15"" Fiskars Handle Saw",Do not buy this product if you are buying it with the expectation of having it for years to come (as I did). It's definitely not built to last. The screws attaching the handle to the blade were loose which results in way too much play in the handle.Not at all what I expected when ordering Fiskars brand.
3,Price is a bit high.,"It's a good whiteboard. However, I don't think it's worth $185. At most I'd pay no more than $100-125 for this item. It did not include the 16 page planning guide that the description says it comes with. The grid is very nice, you can't see it from a distance, but up close it's there and helps out with drawing and writing straight.It came with mounting instructions, but not the correct instructions. ""L"" Brackets only come with boards over 5 feet, and those are the instructions that came with this board for some reason. It does come with wall mounting screws and plastic wall anchors. Overall, it's a good item, but not really worth the asking price."
1,I hate to quibble but......,"I am a beekeeper and do a school program about bees, I collect as many children's books about bees as possible for my library, Sadly,this book is not a keeper for the main reason that the main character is referred to as ""he"" when in fact all worker bees are female and males are slackers whose only job is to fertilize a queen. I can't go around feeding misinformation to children and this book shouldn't either."
2,What's wrong with this picture?,"Usually I don't bother reviewing so-so books, but I have to ask: How could they include such women as Lady Di (oh, please), Jiang Qing, Eva Peron, Sonja Henie (Sonja who?), and what appaled me the most, Phyllis Schlafly, in the list? When I saw the book I though it would be about women who had helped to elevate our status and create better conditions for us all, but Schlafly appears here, and I quote ""as the woman who helped shot down the Equals Right Amendment(....)"" I was mad. Where are the truly deserving women, the ones that did try their best to leave the world a little better that when they found it? Where is Eileen Collins, Gabriela Mistral, Karen Horney, and why not, Audrey Hepburn (isn't she a way more reasonable choice than Jane Fonda?) I'll grant that they compiled a more or less good list of important women, but I'm glad I borrowed this book instead of buying it. I have better plans for my money."
3,Moderately good book but...,"The authors of this book had some interesting choices of women for their most important. That's fine, ""most important"" is a pretty subjective term anyways. What bothered me was the short shrift this book seemed to give many of these women. If you read the brief blurb on Eleanor Roosevelt, you'll come away thinking she was nice to black people. This book doesn't give you enough details to explain why these women are so extraordinary.Still, the book introduces many women of the 20th century that readers would probably not have heard of before."
3,not bad...,"not a bad synopsis of important women, i don't know if i'ld agree with every entry, though. for a real education on important women, there is a book called 1,000 years, 1,000 people that ranks the 1,000 most important people of the millennium and there are women from history in there i didn't know existed. for what it's worth, though, this book isn't bad."
1,What a disgrace to 99 women.,To lump Jane Fonda in with these other 99 women is a disgrace to those 99 women. Jane Fonda was nothing but a traitor and certainly not important to the 20th century. There were some significant women left off this list but the fact that they included Jane Fonda is a joke. Don't waste your time or money.
5,Does just about everything,"This is the best antivirus protection I have had. I have used Panda, Macafee and Innoculae IT. It checks everything, and I mean everything, automatically and has eliminated several problems already. The only possible complaint is that the full computer scan is slow, but since it is automatic and goes about its business in the background, this is an observation and not a problem. I have it installed on a new computer: pentium 3, 1ghz, 512 ram 60G hard drive and an old computer: pentium 1, 64 ram and 10G hard drive, with no problems of stability or system slowdown on either computer."
1,Not ready for XP,"I have previously used Norton 2001 on a Windows 2000 system and was very happy with it, so the poor quality of this release was a disappointment. I attempted to install NAV 2002 on a fresh install of XP Pro and it failed completely. As soon as the installation program completed, the entire OS locked up. After several minutes of lock-up I powered off the computer. When I attempted to reboot, Windows could not load. I had to reinstall XP in order to use the computer again. I contacted Symantec tech support and they recommended installing from a clean boot. The results of following this advice were the same as before. After several hours of reinstalling Windows because of this product, I have no further interest in attempting to use it. It has caused me more damage and annoyance than a virus ever has."
1,A Waste of Time,"I must say, this product, is HORRIBLE. I tried to install it, and I keep getting a scipt error. I dont care what anyone else says, I shouldn't have to pay via credit card for advice on how to install this product after I spent fifty dollars on it, and countless other dollars on previous NORTON products. I have tried ALL of the worthless troubleshooting techniques off of the website, and they do not work. I am A+ and N+ certified, so I know it is not me. Others have had this problem. Norton, you dropped the ball big time on this product. I will NEVER buy another one of your products again, and will make it my mission to make sure those I know do not buy your product. Instead of trying to capitalize on the XP launch with your claim that you are ""the first piece of software designed for XP"", take some time and make sure all the bugs are worked out before you release the product. Norton, you are rich enough, work out the bugs before releasing the product. I am disgusted with this."
1,Warning! Unresponsive Customer Service!,"Although the product itself may be functional, you face a corporate wall when trying to get any information about your order, or if you wish to return a product. The incredibly poor customer service that Symantec provides will leave you pretty much on your own.Additionally, if you wish to return a product, good luck! They place so many roadblocks in your way, it will be next to impossible to get anything done. They are completely unresponsive to any form of communications you may attempt."
3,Norton Antivirus 2002,"This product, while necessary is quite annoying. NAV cannot cope with and encrypted Web page. It completely removed all the screen texts. In order to deal with the problem, I had to disable the auto protect.Then when I receive or send e-mail, NAV will not let messages pass in the disable mode.This sort of intrusive problem is not new. It was so bad with Windows 95 that I eventually had to uninstall it."
1,"Bad Service, Bad Software","I downloaded the trial version of this software. Little did I know this required me to purchase the software. Why? Because when I tried to uninstall the trial version, my net connection stopped working. Not just one account, two accounts - one through DSL and dial-up connections. When I tried to get help from Norton, they pointed me to their standard uninstall software and then had the audacity to blame my service providers - despite the fact that both providers were affected and despite the fact that my wife's system connected to both providers without any problems. So, now I own Norton Antivirus because otherwise I couldn't connect to the net. But if I had a choice, I'd buy McAfee."
4,Norton Anti Virus 2002 download,Very easy to download and install. Does not interfere with computing.Very good product.
2,Norton Antivirus 200x,"While this is great anti-virus software the support is terrible. In particular, be prepared to buy this program year after year.I was left almost speachless with rage after many hours of trying to renew my virus subscription. I'm usually very good with the net but the constant error messages defeated me - forget about trying to call support unless you want to pay the price of the package again to learn how to install the package!It seems that the entire process is designed to make you buy the latest version each year and even that is not painless.I'm switching."
2,"Good anti-virus, but bad software...","I've been a user of Symantec products for 12 years now. I've given up on Systemworks because of poor quality, and I'm now ready to give up on AntiVirus as well. It is excellent at catching viruses, but I have to reinstall the software every 2 months or so because it eventually disables itself (not an uncommon problem that is listed in Symantec's support site since the release of this product, but still unresolved). Right now my computer is not protected against viruses even though I have installed Norton AntiVirus 2002 4 times now...and the only reason that I know it, is that looking hard at the little icons in the system tray, the Norton AntiVirus icon is missing.Sorry, but no product is good enough to be worth reinstalling every few months."
1,Where is my download?,"I ordered a software item yesterday for download, that specified it was available for download, and I still can't download it. It doesn't take 24 hours to process a credit card! I've never received service this slow from any other vendor."

5,Effortless Install - W98 User,"I first purchased the McAfee Profesional software. After reading the reviews for the McAfee Antivirus, I returned it and exchanged for the Norton 2002. Then I read the reviews herein for Norton, and found the same types of complaints. After discussing with my tech support analyst at work, he assured me that the Norton (and McAfee)should install an run as advertised. It did, installed, downloaded updates and scans without any problems - in W98 OS. I'm wondering if the anti Norton and McAfee reviews are written by stockholders of the other company?"
5,"No problems at all, works great","I currently use Windows 98 SE and have MS Office installed. I installed NAV 2002 8.0 with no difficulty at all. It functions perfectly and has not interfered with my MS Office documents at all. The pop-up window for outgoing e-mail is a little annoying, but that is a very minor quibble. In short, I heartily recommend this product."
1,Beware of NAV on XP,"I have had nothing but grief with this product on XP Home.Every time I installed it (and I've done this several times), it had trouble with the setup, and when I finally got it to work, in a few days it completely ruined my OS by thrashing critical files. (Thank god for Ghost).Norton support was less than useless and all I could get from them was a suggestion to use the money back guarantee.On my other system (Win2000Pro) the program works well, with a downside of slowing the computer considerably."
1,It may kill computer viruses...,"BUT IT DROVE ME CRAZY!! When I purchased my computer (P4 2.2 GHz from Gateway) this program came with it. For the first time I booted my computer up, it worked fine. Everytime since, it hasn't booted up correctly, and I found Norton to be corrupt. I reinstalled it, and it happened again. I had had Norton on my previous computer (PIII 700mhz, Windows Me), and had no problems with it. I was really surprised at how badly it worked. I gave up on the program, since it seemed to be doing more harm then good. If you want a good virus program, look elsewhere."
2,It is what it is. . .,"2 years ago when I bought Norton Anti-virus, I thought it was great. Support was great, software was easy to use and did only what it needed, etc. Now I'm waiting for my license to run out on the 2007 verion. The software is still basically fine, but the support is now highly fee based. Also, their referance area of their website is plagued with errors which will send you to support. Support is just a fancy way of saying saying, ""fancy conman who tries to scare you and the sell you support for 2 - 3 times the price of the software."" Uh. . .No thanks, I'll just buy elsewhere.My opinion. . .Pass on Norton and McAffee. Find one of the lesser known brands which works."
2,too many errors,"The antivirus is not the best. It keeps telling me to subscribe for it when i already did, even twice. It does not update its virus definations, and some viruses have turned off or destroyed the email scanning. Don't buy it. it was good until all that happened. ( no offfence to norton intivirus Inc.)"
3,Subscription Renewal Problem,"The product itself works fairly well. However, when I received notice that my subscription was about to expire, I renewed online, paying up front. I could never get the product extended and could not get online help from Symantec. There is no toll free number (or otherwise) to reach technical support. They simply put you through the hoops online and you never get assistance. It is a lost cause to renew your subscription. Would not ever trust them with your online purchases in the event you need tech support (and you will need it)!"
2,I'm changing to McAfee,"I had no complaint with Norton virus protection, but failed attempts to get the virus protection updates from Symantec, that I paid for, have ruined my opinion of the whole package. I e-mailed customer service for help, and was told I had to contact tech. support, who told me I would have to contact them by a long distance phone call if I wanted any help. My third e-mail to customer service was not answered. Symantec has become so large it no longer has time to help its customers, so I'll do my part by reducing their customer base."
3,"Not bad software, watch out for the Company!","Having used the downloadable anti-virus software by Norton (Symantec), I found the software adequate for what I needed. After having the software, for 6 weeks, however, my hard rive crashed. I went with a new computer, along with Windows XP Pro. I contacted Symantec to re-download a copy of the software I just bought six weeks earlier. To make a long story short, I recieved multiple runarounds. After double-digit emails, I still have not recieved either a. a copy of the package I bought, or b. my money back. Sooooo, not a bad package, but I'LL never buy another package from Norton again!"
1,Buyer beware!,"After downloading the Norton Antivirus 2002, I was not only unable to install it into my computer, but had to do an entire system restore! A prompt after the download showed ""unable to initialize virus scanning engine data base files"".....the computer then would freeze up, and required shut down at the power source. Until I did a complete recovery on my computer, I was unable to get out of the safe mode. As for tech support?? Well, don't be fooled. If I could give this product a ""0"" star, I would. I'm going back to McAfee."
3,Dr Norton doesn't really know his stuff now does he?,"Well, I'm sorry guys but this programme is so crap. Yes crap. Now, I know thats not a nice word to use... particularly when your about to buy it but I really must stress this aint the one for you. Every time you get a virus, it will open, infect and kill whatever its made to kill or damage. Afterwards Norton will jump up with an anoying dos based window telling you that yes, the reason you cant open word or access the internet is because some geeky teenager with more grease on his face than mc donalds frying pans nation wide has crept into ur pc or sent u a nasty file attachment. And like: duh! I really never knew that Norton thanxs!. And then.... then... the flaming thing wont let u fix it, or delete it. U have to go to their website ... or someone to fix it for you. Lets face it... If a job like virus protection needs doing... get someone else to do it!"
2,Why?,"Why? Sumantec include less funtions in this version of Norton Utilities? if you compare the Norton Y2K and the Norton Y2K+2 you see the first one have a lot of funtions and scans (Harward Scan, Etc..) and the second one do not include all of that (more new with less funtions) plus of that if you have the Black Ice installed the program do not work properly, well i think is better you see if you really need this product before because the funtions it have are great but maybe your system can work with the las version"
1,Norton AntiVirus 2002 8.0,"The product along with tech support from Symantec hasbeen a nightmare. The program came loaded on a DellPC and worked fine until it was time for subscriptionrenewal. After numerous e-mails with Symantec techsupport that resolved nothing, I still do not havea working product. Several attempts to navigate theSymantec telephone tech service never resulted in mybeing able to speak with anyone... it was v-mail hell!Shame on Symantec for such horrible tech/customerservice in this day and age."
3,Auto Protect is unstable for XP,"Norton 2002 works great on windows 98 and ME, but the auto protect feature is unstable on XP. It turns itself off for no reason when you log off or turn off the computer and come back to use it again. Symantec's website service area, states that it does not know why yet, but is aware of the problem. I find it annoying to have to check the icon and enable it if it comes up disabled. Not exactly what I would call XP Certified."
4,Easy to use and unobtrusive,"I installed Norton Antivirus easily and without glitches despite having just installed Windows XP. Since then it has unobtrusively monitored my extensive email and web meanderings. I guess the real proof of the pudding will be when I eventually encounter a virus, but meantime it was a real relief that, unlike McAfee, which I had before, Norton does its job without feeling the need to make its presence felt constantly."
1,Skips the virus and goes straight to the autopsy,"NAV alerted me to a virus AFTER it chewed up and destroyed my registry, deleted several icons and start menu entries. The disinfecting directions their so-called ""support"" site didn't work. The instructions were clear, concise and well written - they just didn't work. Support is expensive and almost nonexistant. Somehow paying TWICE for a product does not seem to be a good business practice and is definitely not customer-oriented.System scans are long and laborious; uninstalling NAV is torture. Since fighting the virus and contacting customer support are both futile, I'll have to wipe the drive clean and start from scratch. Thanks for nothing Norton!!"
3,It detect minda virus but could not cleen my system,"Yes, it was a good thing to know that my system got infected but would of been better if Norton anti virus could of cleen it .It end of letting me know that it can not delete the infected files and my system still has nimda virus .At least it should of explain why it can not delete the infected files . SO is it better to know that I'm sick but no cure and i will dieorI just die without knowing that I was sickI rather die without knowing i was sickand if you think that"" still it was good to know about the virusso I can safe my data. The bad news that ( it is my most important data which is infected with minda virus) so there is no point of backing it up .I am sure there is a way to cleen it but so far no idea.Sorry for my bad English skills (Not my first Language)"
1,Not worth a nickel...,"I bought this for our new computer and it had simple installation intructions. (Which was good, becaue I am not a ""computer wiz"". Two weeks after installation, we had problems with the software. I have tried to contact Symantec Technical Support for assistance, but they want to charge me more than half of the oigianl cost of the software before they even say ""Hello"". Making this an extremly expense software. I have a very BIG problem with this. This product is not cheap, and I do not feel Symantec should be charging extra to assist those who purchased their product. If my questions or problems were found to be unrelated to the Norton Antivirus software, OK then, go ahead and charge a fee. But this is ridiculous. I guess if you are not a ""computer wiz"" this is not the product for you, no matter how much ""Norton"" is used by others. All they want is your money!"
1,"ONE BIG PROBLEM, DOESN'T DETECT VIRUSES","Norton has been a very popular virus program for many computer, but the actual virus protection of these programs have big problems. I had norton antivirus installed on my 98 box and had a virus for many months even though i kept norton up-to-date and ran it frequently. (thank god for free on-line scans) (...) This is no different i tried to trial and that was the same.If you want a real virus protection program get pc-cillin (or even Panda but that is more expensive). It is recommended by all real computer geeks that i know(including myself, plus it is cheaper!! Plus it doesn't need to be updated ever hour and can detect virus that might be in your system that are not yet descovered. Norton is very slow and sad!"
1,Problems installing - tech support non-existent!,"I strongly recommend against this product. Since purchasing I have not been able to install without crashing my computer. Can not reach Symantec technical support for help and web site offers absolutely no assistance.I am a long time Norton user, but will be switching to McAfee immediately."
2,sorry this one does not live up,"I got a virus using Nortons, and since then I have had several friends have the same thing happen. We all do updates and do not open attachments, so I really recommend anything but this!!I have a friend that runs a teaching school for computers, and he said he had trouble with all the machines running Nortons getting viruses. He changed to Panda and has not had the first antivirus since.I have been running AVG I have had none of the problems, same with my friends."
1,Allows virus to be sent on install,"I purchased a copy of this software and installed it on a computer that had become infected with a virus. During the registration process the software sent the virus to everyone on my contacts list. It did this automatically and with no way to cancel the operation. It's a Catch-22, The software can't clean your system until you get the latest updates, you get the latest virus definitions by registering on the web, but as soon as you connect to register, this software allows infected files to be sent to all your friends and associates with no way for you to stop it."
5,Virus Free with Norton Antivirus,"You don't even know it's there, but unlike others around you, you remain virus free!! I decided to purchase this product for my brother-in-law to protect his PC."
5,A favorite for my cockatiel,"I can't buy them around here, so amazon is where my cockatiel gets his favorite food...fast shipping!"
5,Great book - Rip-off price,"All the I Love to Read sets are thrilling sets for immergent readers. If you go to the [...] site, you can find all the Nora Gaydos readers, brand new, with these sets priced at $16.99. What a shame this seller wants the viewers to believe that this set is some rare priceless edition.Cathy - A teacher"
5,Excited to Read,My daughter had been struggling to read more fluently so I got the Bob Book Series for her & it was such a struggle to get her to want to read them. A teacher working in a bookstore recommended this series & it was amazing how excited she was to read to me every night. We quickly went thru the Prereader & Level 1 & 2 & now I am waiting for the level 3 books to arrive. They are funny & the illustrations are nice & colorful. Loves putting the stickers on when she has finished the story. They made a big difference in her confidence & she can't wait to read them. Highly recommeded as a confidence builder!!
5,Great books for beginner readers.,My 3-year old daughter enjoys reading these books. She practices her phonetics skills with the simple words in the stories. The storeis are funny to keep her interest.
5,"If you haven't read Evil Offspring, you don't Know HORROR","The book is based in America where four friends go to a housewhere Peggy and Eric Porter( two of the four charachters) grew up witha horrific childhood. Their father found a 6000 year old corpse that was pregnant and he took the unborn child home, and the child was named Lynn, and the body build of the child was shocking! Well, somewhere in this story, a Thai comes to help the four( who have had quite a few scary experiances ) and prepares for a seance in order to find out things about the horror filled house. Well, this seance ends in a bloody mix of blood, brains, and all the gore you'd expect to find in a terrific horror novel. Buy the book, and make sure you buy a lot of spare underpants for the novel's climax."
1,neck cracked after 4 logs,"got this axe an hour ago and split 4 logs .looked axe over and seen a crack at the neck..no misses, just solid hits onto solid logs ..good news the logs split fairly easy.i will return for another and hope for better luck.."
5,Super,"This is a superb tool. It acts as a splitting maul and an ax at the same time. I never knew that chopping wood can be such an enjoyable process! The weight is perfect, allowing great precision and it's sharp enough to cut through the biggest knots.I ran out of my own wood 2 hours after I got this axe and I am going to see if my neighbors have some to spare for me... Heck, I might even chop their wood for them free of charge! If the handle was just a little longer, 2 inches maybe, then I'd give it 10 stars...If there is a perfect splitting maul, then this is it."
4,Nice axe,"Received this item yesterday and so far it is working pretty well. Lighter than my mauls, which is nice. Still has a tough time on the knotty hardwoods, but goes through straight pieces much cleaner than a maul."
3,Needs a heavier head,"Well made, has a nice heft, but I think it needs more mass (steel) on the end. It's just too light. Almost an axe and not a maul."
3,ehhh...,"out of the box this was amazing, but the blade had chips in it after only pruning some oak limbs no bigger than 2"" diameter. it comes razor sharp and is very good, but i wish i knew what metal exactly it was, and i think if i had it to do again, i would just buy a good ol' fashioned steel head hatchet. but oh well, this'll do"
4,good choice,"In my quest for a quality tool to split the inherited wood pile at the bottom of my new back steps, I came across the Fiskars line of splitting axes and all those 5 star reviews that accompany them. It seemed a no-brainer: if I want to split wood, this is the best tool for the job."
5,Awesome axe,"I read over 100 reviews given this axe 5 stars, that's almost unheard with any product. I even watched videos people uploaded on YouTube about this ace and was very impressed. I ordered this a e and it came packaged neatly and ready to go. I brought the sharpener also and ran it through about 5 times and started cutting some freshly cut wood I had. This a e was slicing through the wood like it was butter. I'm am very very impressed with this axe."
4,Finally a good length handle,"I've got the 28"" Fiskars splitting axe with the 2 1/4# head and I really love it, but the short handle leaves a little to be desired. This desire was cured with the X27! I love the 4 1/4# head and the 8 extra inches on the handle puts this axe in the VERY comfortable range. I'm 6'1"" tall and this axe has plenty of length that allows me to have a very normal and comfortable swing that keeps the axe head far enough away that I'm not overly concerned about the swing path. It's long enough to allow me to swing down on the wood in such a manner that if I were to miss, the axe would hit the ground rather than my foot/shins.This axe is definitely worth the money if you like the Fiskars products. I like the handle and the fact that it has a lifetime warranty from breakage. With an axe, this is definitely a plus."
3,"I would go with the 36"" super splitting axe, or the 28"" 2 lb. chopping axe","I found the weight and length of the handle to be awkward. I am six feet tall, light build, and although it works, i really prefer the 2 lb. chopping axe made by fiskars to split wood because i can swing it twice as fast and get enough power with what feels like half the effort... and a bonus is that the split wood pieces don't flying away as much. The chopping axe... is taller (longer cutting edge) so it gives me control over where the wood splits.I believe the 36"" super splitting axe would be best for wet pieces of fir that just bounce this 4 lb. splitting axe off, and would give the power needed to split larger-diameter pieces, which i have had trouble splitting with this axe.I think other fiskars axes are amazing, but I feel the head of this axe is too heavy in proportion to the length, and i am happy with regular length and weight (6 or 8 lb.) fiberglass maul."
1,broke,Thos Axe promised so much light sharp great at splitting but after I just sharpened it I went to split this about 36 incher and the back blew out of the handle never ever will I buy a fiskars again
1,Disappointed,"Fiskars Super Splitting Axe with 28-Inch Handle and 4-1/4# Head #7854- The handle is too short. You lose a serious amount of mechanical advantage by having only a 28"" handle. Because of this, my old dull ax could perform as well if not better. Also the head can be sharpened as a knife. But if you use it often you will run out of space for sharpening. After using it I think it was designed for occasional recreational splitting. I do not recommend it if you plan to do much splitting."
2,Not so super,With great expectation my Super Splitter arrived today. All of the reviews convinced me to purchase this splitter. Splits as easy as a knife thru butter they say...Well I went right out to split a 20 in round of ash. Took great aim and let her fly. The axe head hit the round and bounced straight back up and nearly hit me square between the eyes. Didn't even leave a make on the log to be split! Talk about disappointment! It will split real small stuff but be realistic!Sorry Fiskar but i don't know who is writing all of these great reviews. Not so Super..Back to the monster Maul
3,What handles fit,"This seems like a great 4lb maul with a short handle. Does anyone know if after you break the handle, it takes a standard size handle head so the handle can be replaced with a 34"" one, to reduce risk of destroying foot or ankle?thanks"
5,fiskars 7854 axe,"I have burned wood for over forty years and have used many different types of hand splittig tools, prefered a 3lb single bit axe. I purchased a Fiskars 7854 splitting axe two weeks ago and am frankly amazed at what it will do. I burn hard maple and this axe splits even the toughest pieces with ease. I estimate it has reduced my splitting time by at least 30%. Now if someone could just do something about the mud here in the northeast. Do not hesitate, buy one, you will be thrilled with it. One note; you will have a tendenancy to short strike with it at first, WATCH YOUR FEET!!!! It is now four years and fifty face-cord of wood later, still the best hand splitting tool I have ever owned. A few strokes with a flat file to shine up the edge and split away."
5,Fiskars x27 splitting axe,"So the Fiskars axe turned up and was immediately impressed with the quality and the weight was excellent. Used it this weekend for the first time and what an axe. Set a load of pine up and preceded to split the logs. This axe went through them like a knife through butter. To be honest the chopping of firewood is a new life choice so not used anything to compare the x27 to but I certainly have no regrets to biting the bullet, maybe paying that bit extra for a named brand but glad i did. will be purchasing a shorter version in the near future just for those smaller logs, but go for it."
5,Best axe ever.,"I have split a lot of wood over the years. I use to get annoyed when a splitting maul would get stuck in a big round and then having to work it loose just take another whack....lots of extra energy used. This axe is hands down the best I have ever used. I just split about 1/2 cord, a lot of it wet and knotty, and am totally impressed...some design engineer out there got it right, this design should have been invented decades ago! I don't write a lot of reviews, but this axe certainly warrants one."
4,Perfect in nearly all ways.,"I purchased a Fiskars Super Splitting Axe after trying one owned by a friend, on a 24"" madrona wood round. It split the wood with exceptional ease, especially since it weighed half as much as my old splitting maul.The shape of the head, the sharpness of the cutting edge, the coated surface that glides through pitchy wood, along with the lightweight shock-absorbing handle, makes for an easy to use and not fatiguing tool. My only concern is the butt-end of the handle, which is thin plastic, and seems easy to chip or break. Otherwise, a truly wonderful tool."
5,Fiskars Splitting Axe,"This splitting axe is well worth the money that I spent on it. When I initially got it, I swung at the first few logs with my full force. I ended up splitting the log and burying the head of the axe completely in the ground. Green wood takes more effort and logs with knots in them can also take a couple of whacks to get them split, but for my purpose of providing wood for evening and weekend fireplace fires, this axe was perfect."
5,"Great axe - powerful, lightweight and well balanced","Nicely balanced, lightweight and far more powerful than I'd have guessed from its weight; the Fiskars super splitting axe is great. One thing keeps it from being perfect - it doesn't come with a teenager to split and stack all day...."
4,Efficient splitter,"I haven't got to use this splitter much, but I think it will be very efficient for splitting small to medium rounds. I'm not sure if it will handle big rounds very well, but I haven't tried yet either so it may be perfect. It is very, very sharp which is what helps that low weight head work so good."
5,Well worth it.,"I am impressed with how well this works. I've used a standard splitting maul for years and after trying this the first time I'm sold. If you have large logs to split this is the way to go. If on the other hand you Are splitting logs that are less than 12-14"" the fiskar splitting axe is surprisingly good."
4,Fiskers axe replacement for axes sold at garage sales,I ordered the Fiskars 7853 axe to replace axes that were sold at garage sales because I would never need a small axe again!The axe is nicely balanced and easy to use. It will be used to cut down wood turning blanks and other chopping tasks.It was sharp as received although I sharpened it with the Fiskars sharpener. The plastic case protects the axe when not in use.I would recommend this axe for light general use.
4,didn't get x25,I just got my order and they didn't ship the new x25. Just a heads up for all of you that were wanting to upgrade. Good fiskars quality just not the new one.
5,AWSEOME but Sharpen First,Best axe I have ever used! Worth every penny but you need to sharpen a bit first. Buy their axe sharpener for $10 and just roll this through it about a dozen times - takes less than a minute to do.
4,good bang for the buck!,"good, sturdy axe. Bought it as a gift for my boyfriend, who loves the task of chopping firewood on our camping trips. both of us are pleased with the weight and ease of handling the axe."
5,Sweet,"This axe is well balanced and very strong. I dont always hit just perfect. It has taken a beating from me. It also holds its edge. Great product, couldnt be happier."
5,Great size,Perfect length for chopping and hacking. Extremely sharp and made very well. The best in the size i have seen.
5,Magical axe,This is one of the greatest tools I've ever owned. It is almost magical in its ability to split wood.
5,fiskars x27,"A real man's splittin' axe. Very tough and splits 20"" Rounds with ease. Handle of axe holds up extremely well."
3,It's ok.,"Purchased this axe after reading the reviews. A 'magic bullet' it's not. Compared to my old traditional maul, it performed a bit better. It does have a very sharp edge. Now, I have used the axe only to split wood (oak) and not to cut down anything. So, it might be fine for that purpose (I prefer a chain saw, myself). Sorry, I must break the trend and give this an average score."
4,"Quality product, but engineered oddly","I bought this splitting ""hatchet"" to supplement a smaller Fiskars hatchet and a larger Fiskars Splitting Axe. The weight of the head is way out of proportion to the length of the handle. There is absolutely no reason for the head to be this heavy on a handle this short. The splitting profile in a head of half this weight would be useful; but as designed it is too cumbersome to use for smaller jobs, and the handle is too short to use safely on logs that would require a head of this weight."
2,Hobbit tool,"Great design,great blade but if you are over 5'5"" pass.This is the most dangerous splitting tool I have ever seen. If you are in the range of 6' as I am you will quickly see that if you were to strike a log with a glancing blow the arch of the swing carries the blade around mid-shin level. I shutter to think what that would do to your leg."
3,Can't do heavy work,"I have now split about 1/2 a cord for the winter with this axe. I bought it to replace a good quality 6 pound maul where the handle finally gave up. I am disappointed. Based on the other reviews, I expected that I would be working less. I find that I am working harder, and can't tackle the 20-30 inch rounds I am used to splitting. It works ok for well dried 10-12 rounds, but that isn't going to get me through the winter. I have been back to my cheapo 10 pound fiberglass maul, or using this with wedges. I guess I will just buy a new handle for the old maul. I find myself wishing that there were a couple more pounds on the head to get it in the wood. I believe in buying good tools, and this is good quality but this is just too light to do a serious job!!!"
2,Light and brittle,"I love this axe at first. It has great balance and fits beautifully in my hand. It is easy to swing and almost always goes where you want. But when it doesn't, it breaks. The supposedly unbreakable handle shatters like the plastic it is. I'm on my third in 2 years.Buy from a local vendor, because you will be taking it back every few months for a new one."
5,fiskars x27,"Very nice.I felt the 28"" axes were just a little too short for me (currently own the splitting axe). This 36"" model is great. It is not as heavy or as hard to swing as an 8lb. maul and therefore I can use it for longer periods of time without tiring.Even though it is 36"" long, the handle has a nice hook-like knob on it to prevent the axe from sliding out of your hands. This also prevents the axe from feeling too long (actually feels more like a felling axe than a traditional maul).The carrying case/sheath is also a nice touch. It is similar to the older Fiskar models, but has a better clasp mechanism to hold the axe in place."
5,*** WOW *** I Should Have Purchased This Many Years Ago,"If you can trust ""here-say"", then keep reading. I am the father of seven children, and we have heated with wood for the last 18 years or so. I can't tell you how many mauls we have purchased, and broken. Wooden, Fiberglass ... it didn't matter. They basically, eventually, got the job done, but it was always a real chore ... and not a pleasant one. This ""Super Splitting Axe"" is by far the best that anyone in our family has ever used. And here comes the ""here-say"" part ... I haven't even used it yet. My children have not let me! My nine year old son says that he will never use anything else. That's right ... my nine year old son won't let me use ""his"" splitting axe. He was so excited about it, he gave me ten dollars towards the purchase price. Don't buy another imitation maul. Get this one by Fiskars."
3,splits great but handle too short,"Destroys wood, but its a matter of time before I bury this in my boot. I have had several close calls despite trying to be very careful (spreading legs wide, tall splitting stump, splitting backside of log). That being said I am going to buy the 36"" version as it works MUCH better than any other maul I have ever used."
5,It is the Real Deal!,"I bought an axe at my local hardware store, and it would stick in the wood as I tried splitting it, and it was SUCH a pain to get it out. Yeah, it was dull. I wanted something better, and I wanted a splitting axe.I searched amazon, and saw that this Fiskars axe had a 5 star rating, which is always attractive. I read the reviews, and was VERY skeptical. I just could not believe the axe was really that good... So I went to youtube, and sure enough there was a video of a guy splitting with this axe. He was splitting like butter, I could not believe my eyes. I placed my order and waited patiently.I got it, and WoW!!!I can't believe how well this axe splits wood... it has totally made splitting wood fun, because I can do so much more than the crappy axe I had before.I've never been more sure of anything that this axe, and I would recommend it for everyone!"
1,Rating Fiskars 7884,"This product might split wood in it's native country, but will not make a dent in the woods I have here in TX. Such a looser!!"
5,WONDERFUL,Purchased for my husband and brother. They LOVE these axes....the description of this product is spot on. HIGHLY recommend to get one. Light weight to swing but splits hard every time!!
5,Great splitting axe,My shoulders are too shot to use my 8lb maul any longer. But I love splitting so I got the X27 splitting axe. Excellent! Opens the wood very well so what doesn't split immediately I can wedge and sledge. Very pleased with this axe. Delivery was prompt.
5,Awesome!!!!,Best axe I've ever owned. Easy to swing and gets the job done. It makes splitting wood a hobby not a chore.
5,Nothing like Fiskars,"I was at my house in the country today with my new 7854X25 splitter-I own several long, heavy mauls, and had used them with great effort and bravado to split logs for years. I was splitting some 24 inch rock maple logs for this winter's firewood. The splitting was so easy that I jokingly started using one hand and minimal effort to split the smaller pieces-they literally fell apart-Fiskars used science to create the perfect geometry for an otherwise meatheaded tool."
1,Better suited to Computer Users than Woodsmen,"I am very disappointed in this axe.It supposed to be suitable for splitting firewood, and other reviewers are lavishing praise on it. But, from our experience this is far better suited to computer users splitting small amounts of firewood, than to real woodsmen splitting cords of wood. We had about 4 cords of wood, mixed pine, oak, and madrone. This thing doesn't split even 6"" pine logs with one blow, much less any of the hardwoods. Gave up after about 4 small logs.And the requirement to keep it sharp all the time is a PITA compared to a good old-fashioned splitting maul, which works best when it is slightly dull. Plus the maul is much safer, when the kids inevitably start playing around with it, there are no cuts, as opposed to the Fiskars, which will take a finger off with no trouble at all."
2,Fiskars Fizzled,"after reading all the hype about this splitting axe, I decided to give it a try. The third time I used it the head separated from the handle. I am very disappointed with this product. Would not recommend it."
5,spit splitting fun,"thank you fiskar folks for making splitting a spitting fun time in a split spitting quick time, i am a south texas mesquit seller and i do alot of hard wood splitting and this axe is the only thing in are splitting sheds , for anyone who has cut mesquit for a living, you know how hard this wood is and unforgiving to chainsaws and most of all AXEs, i ordered 2 of this last year and now i owen 48 of this 36"" fiskars super splitters, the axe itself does the hard work and i just stand there an watch, theres been a few times that i find myself with one AXE in each hand, just splitting away and in the zone, its a-bit scarey on folks too see a 7.ft tall 425.lb MAN swing-in 2-AXEs at the same time, but the kids love it and it keeps me in shape!! THANKS FISKAR FOR MAKING A GREAT AXE."
5,High quality tool,"Very high quality tool that should not need to be replaced unless lost or stolen. Splitting is easier than conventional axes and mauls. Takes some getting used to, but the X27 is better and easier on the human body than the conventional axes. I've split green Oak and knotty Cherry and the ax performs very well.Blade shipped very sharp, and splitting is very effective. Build quality is evident. Handle is very long and robust. After months of steady use and abuse the handle is holding up perfectly. Edge keeps sharpness reasonably well. Graphite coating on ax head began to wear after 2 months. There is a product called EZ-Slide which comes in a can which can be applied with a brush, as well as an aerosol spray version which restores original slickness.Have owned this for 4 months now, and also bought one as a gift for a friend."
5,What a splitter!,"Bought this new tool with it's claim to fame with some doubts. Let me tell you it lives up to it's claims. Very sharp,great head design,superb balance and the extra long handle really increases the power.Great tool overall. Very pleased with purchase"
1,not worth it,"So my brother bought one of these axes great for small stuff. Once you get into actual logs it's not so good. I split a few with one swing so it's not horrible but it broke, when I hit a nail that happened to be in bedded in the log(found that out later). I mean it actually broke and because it has a plastic handle which is hollow i can't get a replacement."
5,Very nice Axe,Very light weight so easy to split wood. Like it because I haven't busted it yet. Usually break one handle a year.
5,first real axe,"I have owned many axes in the past. With the usual. 3.5lb head. The problem with them is that their blades are very skinny and long. Which always causes the blade to get stuck in the log rather then actually split the log. The wooden handle is often a problem as well with cracks and splinters. your line of axes are exactly what we need. The cutting head is the perfect shape for rapid splitting through even the toughest Knotty red oak. I own two of your axes. The fiskars X-25 and X-27. They both perform wonderful. I do find the X-27 better for me with the longer.handle. but all things considered. I have two great axes, with no problems. Two sharp edges. Two safe sturdy handles. Two very well secured cutting heads to the handles. And plenty of split wood to keep us warm this winter. Thank you for your wonderful products"
4,Chopping block required.,"I will say this is a very good maul to ""add"" to your collection of mauls, just like axes they all have a function and a specific duty. Now most of my wood is split 4' and then cut to length a year later, well each year the butts get heavier and I need to split 16"" by hand. If you split on the ground like I do never standing the wood on a block or even up right then stay with your 6lb maul! But if you want to keep picking up your wood and repositioning it on a block then yes get this maul you will not be disappointed!! Swing for hours and then swing some more. It does not pop the wood open like a 6 pounder but it does not weigh 6lbs. So yes add this to your collection and enjoy."
5,Simply Amazed,"When it's good it is good, and this is VERY good. You think ""The wood will laugh at this light-weight"" when you first pick it up. But, this thing has the last laugh.Start with the handle. The bottom flairs out so it stays in your hands and helps control your swing. The heads' light weight keeps you from tiring out and makes for a better aim. We just took down three oak trees in our yard with trunk diameters in the fifteen to twenty inch range. They are cut into eighteen to twenty inch lengths. It takes two to four whacks to make the first split. After that, one swing usually slices through the wood. I actually think I split wood faster with this axe than a splitter.I split the wood on the ground. No need to lift the logs. I roll the logs onto a piece of plywood, which is protects the cutting edge of the axe.What it DOES NOT DO is split twisted grained wood or most notches. You'll need a splitter for this."
3,4ShortiesOnly,Fiskar's short handles are annoying at best and a buddy with their chopping axe nicked his boot twice already due to its short length. My old splitter and axe handles are a full 8 inches longer than fiskars and are more appropriate for normal sized people. If you're 5 feet tall or less then enjoy a very good cutting tool. Other people think twice.A buddy of mine has one and sets his wood a foot off the ground on a big piece of tree trunk to compensate for the short handle.I ground down the splitting flare on mine and keep it in my pickup for chopping big logs that fall across the jeep trails. The extra weight really knocks out the chips.
4,odd little splitter!,"I split a LOT of wood, typically using a 16 pound sledgehammer & a ""grenade"" wedge, plus various splitting axes. Heard about this ""super splitter"", read all the reviews & thought I'd give it a go.Despite all the reviews to the contrary, I've never had an axe bounce off the wood as much as this one, nor get stuck as often as this does. Oddly enough it still splits most of the time even when it bounces off (?).Works well enough on not too large, straight grain stuff, ash, willow, walnut, etc, but doesn't work worth a crap on elm; that stuff just laughs at the ""super splitter"".A good axe to have in the arsenal, but IMHO over-hyped as a ""super splitter""."
4,Best splitting axe I've ever used.,This axe is flanged at the right angle so it doesn't get stuck in the wood.It's lightweight but still splits most logs with relative ease.It looks to be very durable too with it's carbon fiber handle with integrated forgedsplitting head.I'd recommend getting the sharpener too because it tends to bounce of the wood when the blace gets dull.
2,Fiskars 7884,i just purchased fiskars7884 and during normal use the neck breaks. i've noticed that the handle cannot support the weight of the neck. also the neck itself is hollow.
2,Near miss,"I loved this axe initially. It was sharp and stayed that way. We used it for a few months before the weather warmed up. This Fall we broke it out and started splitting wood. My 31 year old son was placing a wedge, and when he struck it, the axe head broke off barely missing hitting him in the head as it bounced off the wedge. He did not hit the handle on the wedge. If the handle was the quality of the axe head this would be an awesome axe."
4,Fiskars ax,"this is a quality product, at a good price, unable to find this model at the local hardware store, so I was able to find it on Amazon,...I would recommend this product to friends as well as their other models...."
4,A sturdy axe,"After using a Fiscars splitting axe at a friend's place, I ordered one for myself. I appreciate it's seemingly indestructible handle. It doesn't replace my old splitting maul, but I found it works very well for splitting both kindling and heavier pieces for my fireplace."
5,This is a splitting axe!!!,"Surprised how well this axe worked. Had a few maples cut down and asked to leave the wood behind in 18"" lengths so I could split and stack. Surprised how easily it split through the logs. My brother came by to help and brought his HomeDepot purchased splitting axe within a few solid swings the head broke off the handle. He tried this axe afterwards and he to was surprised how easily it made splitting logs. Be careful with misses...I missed twice and caught the top of the handle on the log and my hands/wrists absorbed a lot of the vibration BUT no damage to the handle or any other part of the axe. Recommended buy...those cheap (quality, not price) fiberglass ones from the local stores have nothing on this one."
4,Best Axe ever,The Fiskars Axe are by far the best axe that I have ever used in my 25 years of chopping wood.You must be very careful with it !! Its sharp
5,Best Ever! Have been using for 4 years....,"I have been using this axe very frequently for 4 years and it is as good as new, still sharp. You don't need to be too aggressive with this, as the weight and blade easily cut through some of the toughest logs I can throw at it. No problems with the handle or anything else. Superb tool."
5,awesome.,"It splits large rounds with ease, if they are from a dead tree. Some of the wood we tried splitting was a little spongy and the axe didn't do much too it, just bounced off, but I don't blame the axe for that, some really wet walnut just needs a hydraulic splitter.This is a very nice axe and I am very impressed with both it's build quality and it's ability to split wood. I went cutting with a friend who kind of laughed at it when I pulled it out. After we cut some wood, we decided to split some of it, so he tried it out. He didn't want to put it down he enjoyed it so much and claimed that it was much faster than using a hydraulic splitter. Now he's looking to buy one himself.If you are shopping for this, look at the Fiskars website, they have a whole new line of axes that are probably a bit better than this, including longer handles which I know is a big complaint of this splitting axe. The handle is not a problem for me, at all."
5,best splitting maul ever,"Best splitting maul I've used. It will take on large rounds, 30"" plus, you just chip off the outside pieces first. Of course you're not going to smack it in the middle and split a large round. The steel is soft enough to easily sharpen with a file, but hard enough to maintain an edge throughout the day."
4,The axe of the future,"I love this light weight splitting axe! It's light enough for me to swing fast. Unlike the heavy splitting maul that my husband was having me us, this one is right up my alley."
2,Splitting wood,"I am a short guy, 5'7"" the handle is not right. It is dangerously too short, buy the longer handle. I returned mine, afraid I would hit myself in the shinns. If you want a short handle for camping, but the X17 for real splitting buy the X27."
5,The amazing axe,"I saw all these high ratings and had to try it. Well, my sledge and wedge days are over. I can split two to three times as much wood as before, and with less effort. It is certainly sharp and I always carry it outside with the plastic protector on the blade just in case I bump something. I also invested in steel-toed boots, just in case. The axe makes fell like I am Paul Bunyan."
5,Excellent resource for feeling and splitting.,Fiskar products are great and live up to their reputation. It comes super sharp and is easily refreshed with a few strokes of their sharpener. With a firm stance and a healthy swing I can split wood and do light limbing. I really like mine and recommend it to you.
5,EXCELLENT SPLITTING AXE.,I CHOP A LOT OF WOOD. THIS AXE SWINGS WELL AND SPLITS WELL. IT TAKES A KEEN EDGE. A SUPERB AXE FOR A REASONABLE AOUNT OF MONEY. IT HAS A GOOD HEFT AND HITS HARD.DAVE IN ARIZONA
4,Very inspiring -- a wonderful study,"A friend who is a river guide gave me this book. I never really understood the fasination with rafting until I read this. The writing leaves a little to be desired, but the subject matter and the information is very moving."
3,okay but leaks some,"bought 3 of these for a trip out west this summer. They seem to be very nice quality and the pack itself is, but the water pouch is fairly difficult to fill and on at least one of them it leaked from a source we could not determine."
1,Returned item,The zipper was broken when I received it and the mouthpiece wasn't working properly--I couldn't get a good flow of water.
5,ahahahahhhahahahaha,"This movie is one of the best out of all the spongebob dvd's. Its so funny to think of spongebob getting scared to death. Every episode is like a peice of gold to me.theyre just so hilarious. For 15 bucks on Amazon its a good deal to almost cry because of laughter. I love Frankendoodle where spongebob and his permanantly drunk/crazy drawing sword fight with pencils. And at the end of Band Geeks, where spongebob is singing i practically choked because it was so funny. my 5 year old sister brother dad and mom crack up whenever they watch spongebob. That's why my dad bought himself the whole first season dvd which I recommend. I don't see how I could write such a big review for 10 episodes....because its worth it of course. Anyways to end the review of the magical yellow funny lookering guy with his sponge shape and buck teeth...this is a great and hilarious movie for your whole family to enjoy and laugh their butts off too.FINALLY..Ze End"
3,5 episodes?,"ok im really excited about this and everything but come on. 5 episodes on a dvd is nothing especially when they're 11-12 minuets each. Spongebob is a great show and is one of my favorites, but they can put 10-15 episodes on it easily. I really dont care if its a little bit more expensive...anyway, I will buy this dvd regardless of how many episodes it has although if they continue this....."
1,Might as well buy the seasons,"Spongebob is good, but better in orderThe halloween episodes on here were ok, but the show is better when you have more than one disc of random episodes"
5,Thank Goodness For The New Cartoons,"This is a nice collections of ""SpongeBob"" material, though I suggest purchasing the seasonal boxed sets instead. DVD transfer and production is high quality."
5,More SpongeBob on DVD!,"The first 5 episodes are great for Halloween! One of my favorite episodes on this DVD are, ""Squidward the Unfriendly Ghost"" and ""Frankendoodle"", which wasn't very spooky to me. This DVD also contains the episode, ""My Pretty Seahorse."""
3,Banners at Shenandoah,"I was disappointed in this. I would have thought the great narrative historian could have produced more vivid and engaging historical fiction.Banners at Shenandoah is very much young adult or even for younger audiences; it's the story of a young man who becomes Sheridan's guidon bearer. One thing I did like is that the account is not romanticized. Northern depredations in the Shenandoah, scouting in Southern uniform, etc. are described--though strangely separated from the idol-worshipping view of Sheridan himself.But I found the account vague, bloodless both literally and metaphorically, lacking in description and tension. The Rebels, in particular, are faceless--you'd hardly know they wore gray.Not something I'd recommend seeking out. There is better Civil War young adult fiction out there."
3,Good price for a decent case,"Decent case, but not ideal for my modified Winchester Defender 1300 (see photos). There are two pockets sewn inside that can hold extra ammo, but it doesn't look like they were meant for shotgun shells. For shells, you have to skip every other slot. When I put shells in them, it makes the bag thicker because of where the pockets align with the sidesaddle on my ATI stock. I can see how this case can be good for other setups, though, just not mine.The internal pockets are also ideal for a small cleaning kit, but not much else. Fit-wise, my 36"" end-to-end Winchester fit just fine with plenty of room for my tactical light. Too bad there aren't any straps to help keep my gun from moving around inside the case, something that I have seen with similarly priced cases.I really like how the shoulder strap hooks, rings, and zippers are metal. The zippers are lockable."
4,Descent case,"This is a very good case for the money, but there were a few issues, like velcro missing on one of the inside pockets and the zipper is a little stiff. I would buy again."
5,shotgun case,well made product....shotgun fit perfectly without any adjustments. it's perfect for a tactical mossbergI will probbay purchase another from this company for my AR15
1,"Inconsistent, Complicated Operation","I have had this scale for a little more than a year and it always gives me inconsistent readings. I can step on one moment, step off, and step back on and I can get up to a 10 lb. difference. I have even reset the scale and it doesn't work. The body fat analysis is okay but I'd say pretty inaccurate and inconsistent as well. The profiles are way too complicated to set up. This one was only about $25 when I bought it. I'm now considering just a higher quality scale. I'll pay more, but I think it will be worth it."
1,Not worth the effort.,"Bought this scale (from another vendor), and it is the worst!After about 10 minutes i gave up on trying to set my personal profile and figured it was destined to just be a scale. The next day my wife got profiles set up for both of us after about 15 minutes. We still have a hard time figuring out what sequence of buttons to push to have this thing take your weight and calculate body fat.We've owned it for about 36 hours and I'll probably return it today."
3,The Secret Doctrine of Cosmic Energy revealed...?,"This book is really no different than a lot of other books covering the same subject on the market today, but it is a good read if you want to see a different point of view on it. It covers good luck, personal achievement, energy, astral projection, esp, clairvoyance, healing, and love. The major problem I have with most of the books published by Parker is that they include way too many supposed personal testimonies, and it ruins the flow of the book. EX: ""How one man conditioned himself into a heart attack"". If you want to learn how to do these things and can waddle thru the personal stories, then by all means find a copy of this book. In terms of practical content, it is not that bad."
3,vehicles,My son is not that interested in Little People but they are a nice addition to the set if your kids like them.
3,A solid introduction to Distance Learning,"This book is for those who want to learn more about distance learning, but don't know where to begin. The title of the book says ""An Implementation Guide for Trainers and Human Resources Professionals"" but this book would be helpful to any manager involved in distance learning, whether it is developing a program or evaluating the feasibility of implementation. Chapters include basic overviews of audio, video and web-based learning, determining if your company is ready and program design & delivery. The book includes some valuable information about the differences between the different methods of distance learning. This is a no-nonsense approach without a lot of fluff, but offers some sensible, solid content and a good introduction to the topic. Recommended."
5,The Non-Conformist,"This movie is about a woman who is like all humanity should be. She is a great life figure who we should all take after, if we ever want a better world. She is unselfish to the core, and puts humanity first. She is the inspiration for the nobel peace prize. If not for her presence that humanitarian prize would not exist. It was her influence upon Alfred Nobel (the one for whom the prize was name after) that instilled goodness and grace within him. This film should really be named for her. See it whenever you want a shot of dignity, and grace and the courage to fight against overwhelming odds. We need films like this today with all the trash that's out there. This film is an inspiration! As soon as I saw it the first time , I saw it again. What ever you do don't miss this one."
4,Gives Nice Gloss to Leaves,"I purchased this glove in order to polish the leaves in my yard. It was useful for all leaves, but not rhododendrons, hence the one star taken off. Rhodendron leaves are coarse, and this glove doesn't seem to do much for them. Smooth leaves, like those on a jade plant, are very responsive to the wipings of this glove."
1,Product is insufficient and unworkable,"I received the Igloo 25401 wire cooler rack in a cardboard box. Just that - no mounting or installation instructions, and no mounting hardware at all. After manufacturing such a fine cooler, Igloo fell down badly, in my opinion, with their wire rack holder. The wire rack cooler is still sitting in my house because I apparently need to design a method to mount the rack to the bed section of my pick-up truck - not a trivial project given no instructions and no hardware. There aren't even any obvious mounting holes in the rack!! How do I install this rack, anyway? I appear to need to purchase stainless steel hardware, brackets, etc., and invent something, or else just return the rack. Won't ever do this again."
1,Not very Secure & Expensive for what you get,"The strap is not very secure. I think I would be buying a new cooler about once a month. If the cooler is full it should work fine, but it is empty half of the time. I could have one made (like on my other truck, much Better) but didn't have much time. At this price I should not have to modify this product to make it secure!"
5,"Quality Product, Great Price","Great customer service, received my order fast and product received was exactly what I ordered."
2,Not the best of the poe adaptations,"The editorial review goes on about how lavish a production this movie was. It really wasn't. Simply having a few cheap props, mono coloured rooms and a cast of extras dancing about doesn't mean much. Pit and the Pendulum was the most lavish production. Pit also had superior music. Masque suffers from a bland plot. The only thing that saves the movie was Price.It should also be noted this dvd is not a quality dvd. It may not play in all players. I think this is the last ""midnight movie"" double features I buy. This is my second. The other plays in my computer's dvd player, both sides. This dvd only plays one movie on my computer's dvd player. No doubt these dvds are being ran off in someone's garage."
3,The Missing Flesh Tone Bathing Suit,"It's great to have these on DVD. It was a no-brainer buying it, since I ended up paying around five bucks per film for this double feature. I paid several times more than that for the laserdiscs a few years ago. One thing the laser had that the DVD doesn't is the very quick shot of Jane Asher being thrown into the bath naked. On the laser you can see (if you slo-mo it) that she's actually wearing a ""bathing suit"" that matches her skin tone. I may be splitting hairs, but that quick shot adds just a bit of adrenalin to the scene. It also makes her character seem more vulnerable to the evil Prospero. Now WHY did MGM cut this scene? For cryin' out loud, can't they leave well enough alone?"
4,Perfect Saturday Afternoon Fun!,Vincent Price and Ray Milland acting out Edgar Allen Poe's classics - how could you go wrong?! Roger Corman pours on the cheese in these 2 horror classics...
1,Movie is NOTHING like the story!,"As an English teacher, I had hoped this movie would help my students envision ""The Masque of the Red Death."" Instead, the movie was hardly even related to the story. Most of the movie focuses on Prince Prospero's/Vincent Price's devil worship - something that is NEVER mentioned in Poe's original story. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING, NOT WORTH THE MONEY!"
3,PREMATURE BURIAL SCARED ME AS A CHILD!!,"PREMATURE BURIAL horrified me as a child. Now watching it, I wonder why I found it so scary. It is certainly a good horror film directed by Roger Corman but it is not very scary to me anymore. THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH is a lot more disturbing and scary now that I am an adult. It retains an aura of creepiness and unholyness all the way to the end. These are both great films for the the price."
2,Much to do about nothing,"I guess i was expecting a bit more than simply quotes from the great's.If you are looking for a reference for quotes about cycling then this is the book for you. Some of the quotes are pretty good but the amount of filler in there is quite astounding. He does give a bit of his own history in the beginning of each section which makes things a bit more interesting but most of the good quotes are are the back cover of the book, sort of like one of those movie trailer you watch expecting the movie to be amazing only to find out that the trailer was the brilliant part of the movie. This is a simple reference book and nothing else"
4,powerful but awkward to use,"I have never before had a lopper that had the cutting power this one has. But that power comes at a price: for the gearing action to be effective, the handles must be opened very wide. The problem is that nearby branches easily make it difficult to open the handles enough to go around the branch you are trying to cut."
4,Extremely easy to cut.,I was able to cut through 1.5 inch branches with ease. I'm pretty sure it could handle bigger branches too. Very satisfied.
3,work well after they break...,"The handles WILL seperate from the shears portion under heavy use. But, once you epoxy them back together - I recommend JB weld - making the joint stronger than the factory pressed in fit, these are workhorses. you'll have to do it for each side, the second will fail after you fix the first."
3,Strong but not as useful as I hoped,"I have read all the reviews and think they are all fair in assessing these loppers. I have an old pair of wooden handled ones that are so easy to use I couldn't see replacing them, but finally realized my strength handicapped me. I got these and am happy with the feel of them, as well as the incredible ease of cutting.However, to use them, you have to open them WIDE, much wider than the actual piece you want to cut. This is a problem! I have very long arms for a woman, but I got tired of opening them so widely for each cut, and some branches that should have been easy were not as my arms got more tired from supporting these at shoulder height with the arms spread so far apart to open the cutting surfaces enough to fit the branch in. I agree with another reviewer, these need a redesign on the shape of the cutting blades. I probably won't bother to return them, but I won't use them as much as I had hoped."
3,"Good cutting action, but it has drawbacks","While these do cut well, the movement of the gears means that the handles have to be moved through a wide arc to actuate the blade. This makes their reach shorter because you have to spread your arms wide. So in thick brush or in a tree with tight branches it can be nearly impossible to make a cut. The other drawback is the thick gears make the head quite heavy so the tool doesn't feel as well balanced as the non-geared units. Build quality is typical Fiskars, which is to say quite good, but I came close to returning due to the drawbacks I mentioned. If you have the upper body strength and cut in dense vegetation I would opt for the traditional simple scissors type of loppers."
4,Very Good,"I have some bamboo growing out of control in my backyard & I've heard bamboo is very tough so I had some reservations about using these, but it was no challenge at all. In fact, any type of tree branch the jaws can get around is no problem. I also like the light weight, especially when reaching high branches."
5,Love my Loppers,"I am amazed with the performance of these loppers. They can easily cut through 1 1/2"" branches as described. I have been trimming bushes and trees for forty years and these are by far the best I have ever owned.I got carried away and trimmed more limbs than I wanted to drag to the road for trash pickup though."
1,Broke after 2 weeks of light use,"This product is advertised as extremely durable, but after 2 weeks of light use the rivet holding the tool together broke, rendering it unusable. I was very disappointed."
4,Good but not as good as the older model.,"I had an older model, probably 15 years old that I liked better. Same Brand but made Litle better.The jaws on the older model open wider faster, instead of spreading the arms of the prunerthree feet wide to cut an 1/12 limb.That being said its the best I could find nowdays."
4,Fiskars PowerGear 31-1/2-Inch Bypass Lopper #9154,"Shipped when said it would and the tool is excellent - I can't wait for winter to be over so I can get out in the garden and prune, prune, prune."
1,piece of junk,"I purchased this item, later found out it was overpriced. It arrived in a box 10 times too large, wrapped in crumpled brown paper. The handles were not secured to the cutting blades and every time I tried to use it, the handles came off. I tried to glue them on with gorilla glue, that didn't work. I'm going to try another meofthod of securing the handles. It's not a very good cutting instrument either."
5,Relief,I really like these loppers as they are so much easier to use. I can cut much larger limbs with much less effort. They do not have the little rubber stop to ware out as many other loppers do. Also it is easy to sharpen the blade for a good clean cut.
5,loppers,Even with the wide reach to get them open the flat outright work. i replaced a pair with adjustable length handles with these. if used properly they cut the size branch that they are designed for. if i am cutting past that size i am using the wrong tool. good color to find when i put them down in amongst the uncut branches. very sharp cutting blade. old wood or new branches can be cut with ease. i will buy this type of lopper when these wear out.
2,PowerGear feature makes pruning trees extremely difficult,"The PowerGear feature is this product's achilles heel, which can make cutting larger branches (say 1-inch or more) very difficult or impossible. PowerGear works by using a reduction gear near the blade. This means you have to open the handles much, much wider than other loppers. For example, to cut a 2-inch branch the handles need to be opened literally 180 degrees apart, i.e. all the way open. This means pruning a branch that is in close proximity to other branches (the usual case) just isn't going to happen. I will say the price is good and the blade seems very sharp and durable. In my experience however, this simply is not a tool for serious pruning. At this point I will have to buy a traditional loopper to maintain the trees in my yard."
1,Plastic toy,"Most of the gardening tools that you can buy online or in the stores are just toys. Unfortunately this is no different. The handles are made of plastic (the metal handle inside is very short) and they broke after a couple of months of light use.I can understand people giving this a high rating because it's light and easy to use, but if you want a tool that would last don't buy this. I am still looking for a good long lasting lopper tool...Pros: light, good gripCons: breaks like a plastic toy, price (for how long it lasts)."
2,Needs To Be Opened Very Wide,"These need to be opened very wide. I understand that that's where they get their leverage from, but it's a deal breaker for me. Sent them back."
5,Great!!!!!,"We bought these to clip our piggy's toenails. She has difficulty with this and runs away from it, but it must be done. Anyway the old ones we used even though were sharp took some time and squeeling. These however are the best and we throw some of her favorite food down and with in seconds the job is done and she hardly new it. Also does wonders for the intended purpose of cutting through thick branches with no problem. These are a great find and the price is a good one. Very pleased!"
3,The only Lobbers To Buy,This is by far the best out there. Be sure to spend the extra money and buy this longer handle one. You will be very happy. My Mom which is 80 years old cuts with them.
3,"Good, but flawed","Pro:+ Very good cutters, sharp+ Snips don't twist or bend+ Durable+ Smooth actionCon:- Mostly black... would prefer they be all yellow- Must open the handles really wide so harder to use in heavy brush or near the groundBottom line: Good, but see cons. Can't be your only pair of snips - will need another pair for lifting trees or brush when near the ground or in tight spaces."
5,Best bypass looper on the market,"I've owned several loopers; I have a large property with trees that are grown for marketable timber so they get a work out. No other looper compares to these for ease of use, built to last and low impact on the tree. The only complaint would be you do have to open them up wider than most to get around larger branches which can be tough in tight spots. I'm sure this is necessary in order to support the large cutting capacity. These are far superior to the standard loopers and are better than the ratcheting type. I'm sure I have bought my last loopers and can attest to this as I have family who have owned these same loopers for years and have put them to the test."
5,Great tool for cutting trees,This lopper is great. We have bradley pears that are 10 years old where big branches have fallen off. I have been able to cut off the smaller branches with ease with this tool and put the branches in the woods. This saved us a a lot of money if a tree service had come. It's a great tool. I have used it to cut branches that are much bigger than recommended since I don't have a a saw and it still works great. I love it.
1,plastic part broke,The plastic part between the handle and blade broke after 6 months.I replaced the first one with a wood thing I made. Then 6 months later the second one broke.Get a corona.
5,Fiskars 9154 Lopper,"This lopper is beautifully balanced, light and extremely easy to use, a top product well designed and a steal at this price."
1,Think twice about it,"This lopper requires that you open the handles really far in order to get a 1"" plus branch in the jaws. That, I feel is is wasted motion, especially if you have a lot of pruning to do. Also the gear is not like that pictured in the add. The gears look flimsy and easy to mis-align. The handles are ovalized, therefore your hands must press on the narrow edges of this oval, therefore will dig into hands. I returned it an found a traditional scissor type with long 36"" handles for leverage."
5,Great tool,This tool is geared to cut through branches up to three inches acrossAmazing the way the tool has a cog type method which allows little effort from the operator to cut through larger branchesYou can cut even larger branches if you cut from both sides of the branchVery sharp with long handles to enable you to trim those branches that are high on the tree but hang in your walking pathToo bad it is made in china
5,"great product, ineptly shipped","I bought both the 18-inch and the 31-1/2-inch bypass loppers. They arrived in separate shipments. The smaller tool was securely packaged, but the larger one literally fell out the end of the box when I picked it up from my front porch. It is amazing that it actually got to me. The box had a token amount of packing material inside it, but the lopper had been free to rattle around, and the inadequate taping on the outside of the box had almost completely given way by the time it arrived.The tools are great, better than the Corona ratchet lopper that I used for years until it broke. Since Corona discontinued their tool, I took a chance on the much less expensive Fiskars loppers. I'm glad I did. But if you are interested in the larger tool, you might try to find it in a local store rather than having it shipped by Amazon."
2,"The gearing helps cut, but impacts how these loppers can be used...","The 3:1 gearing helps these loppers cut quickly, BUT it also means that the handles have to open three times wider than ungeared loppers. if you're trimming an outside branch, that's not a problem, but I've found them almost impossible to use when trimming branches next to tree trunks and in other dense foliage.If you choose to buy these, make sure that you also have some regular loppers around or you're going to be muttering to yourself a lot."
2,"Do not test its 2"" diameter limit","This product worked great for cutting all the annoying branches in my backyard. Within the first day I was able to really take control of my back yard again, until I reached a branch that was just about 2"" in diameter, in all honesty the spot I chose to cut seems to have had a knot in it. but long story short, I cut into this branch, and halfway through, the blade (right by the bolt, which seems to have been a stress point) cracks and is no longer operational. great product, just keep it within its range of abilities and you will be happy with your purchase... or end up like me, wishfully hoping it can perform at its maximum, it breaks, and I'm left with a waste of money."
4,Bypass loppers,"This is a really great tool, but the handles don't hold up. It is lightweight and powerful, and takes a full 2"" cut through mountain laurel. However, the handles are made of aluminum tubes attached by pressed in plastic fittings, and they are held on by compression. I have had three pairs, and the handles have come loose on all of them. I also had one pair in which the plastic fitting broke. Fiskars replaced it promptly. If they can fix the problem with the handles, it is an awesome tool."
5,Just As Good As I Hoped,These Fiskar PowerGear Loppers work well. We use two of them and just ordered another. Thanks!
5,Handy Lopper,"Since buying this lopper one month ago I have trimmed my maple tree, my tall nandina and weigela bushes. It made clean cuts and I did not strain or get blisters on my hands. I discovered I had lots of trimming to do after buying the Power Gear. I had been putting it off until I had the proper equipment."
1,Third time is not a charm,"Just got these on a gold box deal- delivered yesterday. Went outside this morning and did a little pruning-1st cut fine, 2nd cut fine and third cut one of the bolts snaps in half. It did cut very smoothly and easily while it lasted. Customer service must be closed for Good Friday, so I guess I will see how their warranty service performs next week."
4,Gatchaman Vol 3 reveiew,"The item came to me in a very timely manner, in brand new condition, the seller did a great job and mailed it to me fast. I will buy from this vendor again. New packaging with great cover art by Alex Ross."
2,"Terrible as a first reader, fine for after BOB book set 1","These books are terrible as a first reader. The Bob books set 1 are a great first reader, because each book features only 1 new vowel, only 3 letter words, and (at first) no words that violate the 1-letter-1-sound rule for easy words. But the so-called Phonics First Steps starts with 2 different vowels in the first book alone, and that first book also has 4 letter words with 2 consonants in a row. The second book has a word with a long vowel, the word ""time"". So, you spend lots of effort teaching the kids to say 'ih' for the letter I, then here is a word where you say 'eye' for the letter I in the SECOND BOOK of the FIRST SET?? Too hard as a first reader.These books are fine as a second set of books, after the Bob books set 1."
4,good choice for begining readers,"If you are familiar with the ""BOB"" books, you'll have an idea about the format for these little readers. The cardboard box with a carrying handle contains a collection of little books that are designed for kids with just the begining ideas of phonics to read. Almost all the words are short three letter words that can be sounded out.I like these better that the Bob books. The illustrations are of a better quality and the stories actually manage to be funny sometimes, despite the limitations of making them extremly easy to read."
3,Ok,"I liked the overall idea of this set and the way the set builds upons sounds from book 1 to book 8. However, the pictures are like coloring book pictures with no color. I suppose your little one could color the pictures for fun, but the books are so small, it would be difficult for a 4 year old to do. My daughter was not interested in the books once we opened the first one and she saw the illustrations or lack there of. With so few words on each page, much is inferred from the picture to make the book interesting, well it's hard to get a little one to sit through if they don't find the story intriquing."
4,These books are great for beginning readers,"I bought these books for my 5 year old who had mastered letters and phonic sounds but had not tried reading yet. He loves them! Within a few hours he had read two of them himself, and he can't wait to try the rest. The small stories are interesting enough to hold his attention and the recurring characters make it easier for him to continue through the series.As a preschool teacher I would recommend these books to parents who are interested in helping their children gain the reading skills that they will need in kindergarten and beyond."
3,"Works, but...","This little dimmer is good in that it looks like a regular switch. But, the downsides are that it is pricey, and the slide is too easy to hit if you are swiping your hand up or down on the unit. It's not a big deal, but it is a bit annoying to find the light set all the way up or down, when you thought you left it somewhere in the middle."
1,READ REVIEWS BEFORE YOU BUY!,"I am usually so good about reading reviews before I buy something, this time I had looked at so many custard cups to get the best deal and saw these and thought wow great price. WRONG!!! YA, the review would have told me because no where in the description of these ""custard"" cups is does it say PLASTIC. Which of course normally you would BAKE your custard and they should call these instant pudding cups instead, as the other review says, they are very misleading. My Bad for not taking the time to read the reviews."
1,Only lasted for two uses!,"I have had great luck with other Fiskar products but this one only lasted for two uses and I only filled it half full and it wasn't heavy. The stitching on the side tore out. I had read the reviews suggesting using duct tape to reinforce the bottom but didn't expect the side to be so flimsy! I was really disappointed, because the weather here has been so cold, that by the time I was able to try it out it was too late to return it. I also found that the handles are too short to be really useful."
4,What a great idea,"I have only used this a few times now, but based on the strength of the reviews here I took the plunge. I LOVE having this when I'm working in the yard. Its lightweight and portability, plus the collapsable storage, make it a great friend in the yard.The only reservation I have is that it developed several small holes in the bottom after being dragged across a concrete patio with an embedded gravel surface. Since I've only had this for a couple of weeks, and only used it two or three times so far, I can't comment on it's life expectancy. However, I would recommend being careful about abrading the bottom. I wish they had used a heavier canvas bottom."
2,Design flaw,"This container has no holes in the bottom for water to drain out. Without the holes, rainwater can collect and weigh down any debris already in the container. I had a similar item from Home Depot that allowed for water to drain out the bottom through a series of holes. This was fantastic. If this container is left out in the rain, it will weigh so much that it can't even be pulled with clippings in it. Very disappointing."
5,The perfect size for my gardening chores,"This 10 gallon container is the perfect size for my garden maintenance chores. It is small enough to conveniently sit by my side anywhere in the garden, and light enough to tote back to the green can when full. It also seems to be quite sturdy."
2,great idea needs improved execution,"The idea of a pop-up bag is great, and the button down tabs also excellent. While others complain of the handle pulling out, my experience was that the buttons ripped out of the seam after only a couple of uses. Eventually, the bottom fabric wore out leaving the springs exposed. Would be great to have a durable version--double or triple sown seams--of this item. Thought it was too expensive for its short life."
4,Great when Workiing in Yard,This is not a full garbage bag size but it's perfect for fitting in the garden and being able to maneuver around the yard while working. Had one before but it finally wore out . . . tore and the metal started coming out and getting in the way.
5,Kangaroo container,"I love it because it's light, portable and easy to use! So do the Sanitation crews and if you don't pour the leaves or twigs or other debris into a bag the Sanitation crew will claim this container too. I know they did it to me twice and now I've replaced both and intend to keep them."
2,Difficult,I would only recommend for experts in the field of stats. The problems were complex for me and I had a hard time with the calculations. That is why I am glad we have SPSS.
4,Are the Gates of Eden Opening or Closing for X of Eden?,"The CD, Beyond the Gates of Eden is good. It's got catchy tunes and the songs aren't repetivite. It's not a happy-sounding album, but it's not depressing either. It's definately worth listening to. In my opinion, the Gates of Eden are opening for them."
1,Poor quality,"It is stiff and kinks very easily, and once it kinks, you cannot get the kink out, so pendents hang lopsided on it. Don't buy this."
2,Sadly not durable,"This product looks very nice, but I won't buy the omega chains anymore. As time wears on, the underlying wire gets more and more kinked, and on mine it eventually broke (about 1.5 years on), leaving the fronting on the chain unwinding. if you're looking for short term it works nicely, but especially with the heavy pendant I put on this one it was impractical for long term use. It may be more durable with a lighter pendant, but I think it would still be susceptible to kinking every time you put it away."
1,El Camino,The shipper shipped the wrong item.We wanted book one and he sent book two.His ad did not say it was book two and was written unclear. Usually it states book two when it is but his did not.
2,Useful but....,"I was looking for a blade to use with my 4 1/2"" angle grinder and this was the most convenient purchase for that purpose especially since wood cutting blades for angle grinders are not too popular. Now I know why. The manufacturers tried their best to innovate a safe and versatile product. However the speed of 11,0000 to 13,000 rpms makes wood cutting with an angle grinder a huge risk. The thing still has a powerful kick back even after following all the rules. As a female, I think I'll leave this one to the professionals and pay to get my fine woodcutting work done."
1,Simply Tap: Learn How to Tap Dance.,Don't waste your money on this one. Her style is grotesque. No really good demos. Not a lot of content for the money.
4,A Great Family Legacy,"My Aunt Geneva brought my heritage to life in her vignettes of her childhood days in her book Barefoot in an Oklahoma Sticker Patch. Through her shared experiences one can appreciate the struggles and triumphs of her great generation. Many of the vignettes are filled with the emotions of the times but laced with the humor and pride of the family. As her niece, ""sticker patch"" has strengthened my family respect, enhanced by family pride and inspired me to leave a similar legacy to my chldren and grandchildren."
4,Depression Life in Oklahoma,"A timid socially deficient young girl becomes a prominant, intelligent, teacher, educator, and community servant through grit and determination and the strength of family during the depression when the thing she did was persevere and walk through those sticker patches.The book is akin to ""Angela's Ashes"" except it is from an American, Oklahoman vantage point."
2,Not Worth It!,"Amazon charged me $40 for ""collector's edition"" and all it was was just the DVD that says ""collector's edition"" on it. Nothing special to over charge people when Hallmark.com is charging only $20 for the same movie! I want a refund for this ASAP!The movie was great and touching, but just don't buy it from AMAZON if they are going to continue charging double the cost for the movie."
4,A,"This is wonderfully informative and entertaining book. While being a very good biography of Mr. Champollion, it also brings vividly to life a whole era of French history from around 1800 and 40 years on. While Champollion is well known in France, he is perhaps less so in English-speaking countries, and this book aids in rectifying this situation. Some other striking issues in the book is 19th Century whole sale looting of Egypt for relics, something that is entirely horrific to modern people. I wonder how it would feel to be the first modern person able to read inscriptions representing 3000 years of ancient history...!?"
4,A thorough examination of the use of cannabinoids in medicin,"Dr Grinspoon is one of the World's leadingauthorities on medicinal uses of cannabis. Hemakes a good case for the re-introduction ofcannabis to mitigate symptoms of many conditions.Unfortunately, drugs must be thoroughly tested,which costs millions. No pharmaceutical companywill fund testing of a herb you can grow on yourwindow sill for free :-("
3,Who Knows?,"I know biological filtration and ""seeding"" aquariums but I am dubious as to the validity of this product. I feel it may be nothing more than dirty aquarium water at best.I used it and it did NOT speed up the process AT ALL."
3,mostly reruns of games already put out on dvd,"In addition to the 6 games mentioned by another reviewer that already exist on dvd, the 1985 game also exists on dvd (the greatest games of busch stadium). therefore, only 3 games in this set are new."
3,Great set for new buyers.,"This would be a great set except that 6 of the 10 games have already been released as part of other WS and Great Games box sets.Only the 79 Cubs game, 85 NLCS, 92 NLCS and 93 WS games are new. MLB has two games from the 1952 World Series in their archives. They could have put those games in this set instead of games that have already been released.If you have collected the past MLB sets you would be better off buying these 4 games seperatly as they are also going to be sold that way."
1,Dangerous and full of lies,This book should not be given to children (nor anyone else).Follow this link for a point by point explaination of why this book is laughably incorrect:http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/closet.html
1,The Writer of this [book] and anyone who follows should be....,"A rather sad attempt of creationistic moronism. Actually, I don't even know if ""moronism"" is an actual word, but I used it anyway. That last sentence wouldn't be out of place in this book. I am guessing that he realized his Bible is too weak to do the job, so he wrote this exhilarating book of nonsense for children. Actually, it's really only exhilarating for the people who actually study the creationist point of view and can't stop laughing from the hilarity. It's sad that the author had to come to Amazon.com and give his own book a 5 star review. He would be the only one who could possibly give this (...) 5 stars."
3,Reliability questionable,"Got two of these. One of them stopped working the very first day. Checked the bulb, which was fine, charged the battery for about 6 hours. That tells me that something is wrong with the battery assembly or the contacts. Happy with the one that works."
5,LUSCIOUS!,this is an elegant & rich book in both visual and information... a must-have for anyone interested in the beautiful aesthete of Paris!
4,Antiques Now and Then,"This is an English translation of an original French text. A rare look at the history of antiques dealing and its European origins. The book is beautiful to look at. The photography is exquisite and the binding excellent. The book comes in two halves, really. The first half is a history of the trade, while the second half is a review of some of the more prestigious antiques dealers of France of recent and current history. All involved are of the high end variety with quality of work-and inferred prices-not for the faint of heart. If you are interested in European antiques you want this."
2,JE1500: Bargain and Bust,"I've had this model for three days now. I'd been planning on making carrot juice with it: I bought the juicer, I then went to the store and bought enough carrots to supply me with a steady supply of carrot juice for a week. Upon taking the juicer home, I found that the carrots WOULD NOT fit into the juicer. I was simply amazed. The opening is just too small to be practical: I don't want to slice 15 carrots down the middle to get a 12oz glass of carrot juice. Aside from that issue, it seems that it's not that efficient at harvesting the juice - i.e. the pulp is still wet and sometimes it spits chunks of stuff into the decanter. Also (as other reviewers have said) I agree that it tends to clog up before the decanter is full."
1,Horrible Exhaust Fumes,I am totally amazed at how cheap and bad this machine is. I read the directions and put it together correctly--as far as I can tell--yet bits of juice are still leaking out the sides when I juice.The worst part: this juicer emits noxious fumes during operation. I thought I was standing behind a truck.This thing is a piece of garbage. I want my money back.
2,Spend a little more for a better product,"This juicer was my first and I quickly discovered why it's good to spend more money on a better model. It leaked so much initially (and while I was juicing beets of all things) that I thought for sure it was defective, so I went back to the store to trade it in. I soon discovered that it's just a flaw with this model.It can get the job done but it makes a big mess and you have to chop everything smaller. After watching a Jack Lalanne informercial and seeing how dry his pulp was (and how much less pulp was discarded) I've decided to take this one back again and upgrade.I'd only try this if you're experimenting with juicing and may not stick with it. Otherwise, go for a better model."
2,no suggestion brocheur for recipes,"I was expecting a little buggestion booklet about some ideas on recioes, etc, also i feel the thing is too imvolved aboute cleaning and reassembling, etc, i am just not happy and doubt seriously i'll use it again, if ever. sorry"
1,Horrible,I bought this a Wal Mart last night. As already mentioned it had no kind of recipe book at all. Five minutes after I started using it it died. Ended up taking it back for a refund. Will look for a more reliable brand soon.
3,Could Be Better,"This is the first juice extractor I've owned, and while I'm enjoying it and it does produce good juice, there are a few setbacks that will keep me on the lookout for another.The first thing that I don't like is that the fresh ingredients ""feed"" is way too small unless you're happy with cutting things into small pieces (I'm not).The second is that the strainer is not easy to clean. I've tried several different ways and still not have been able to do it fully and thoroughly.Oddly enough, it didn't come with any recipes. One or two simple ones to get you started would be extremely helpful. I had to get my information from a friends who's had one for a while (not the same juicer).It does have a lot of parts, but you get used to them and as long as you rinse off the pieces right after you use them, they're not much trouble.All in all, I can put up with the faults of this machine for fresh, healthy juice in return."
4,"Fascinating, and enthralling book about the Holocaust","In The Mouth of the Wolf , by Rose Zar. This book is about a teenage Jewish women surviving the Holocaust, though thru a very different perspective than other holocaust book that I have read. She is passing by as a Polish women working for the German SS army. Then eventually as a maid to the SS commandant of Krakow. She survives only on her wits and her knowledge of the Polish and German peoples relations. She over comes her hardship of her people dieing in concentration camps and ghettos by taking all her hatred toward the Nazis and holding them back and turning them into the make up of cunning, intelligent young Polish women. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a short read on the holocaust but if you want a story of suffering and the struggle of a concentration camp then you would not want it."
4,Light-hearted mostly American Jewish lists,"There is no end to making lists, and certainly no end to making lists about the Jews.In this work Samberg takes the lighter road, and very much the American - Jewish one. He has sixty events about American- Jewish history , and long lists about Jewish comedians, but he has nothing about Jewish religious thinkers or about turning points in the life of modern Israel.In other words this is a kind of peek and skim work which can provide information and amusement, but not serious instruction."
1,a brief coverage of proteomics not recommended,"This relatively short book gives a fairly terse treatment to the subject of proteomics with very little detail on the technologies that have made this field of pursuit possible. There is far more of a focus, from the introduction to later chapters, on protein-protein interactions, when this is to-date mostly beyond conventional proteomics strategies. The last chapter focuses on protein arrays and chips.The figures for the book are of a poor standard, and the entire textbook seems to have been drawn from a course given by the author.In short not a very strong book on proteomics, and one that falls far short of others on the market. I wouldn't recommend it to students of the subject, except where a cursory examination of the subject was needed."
5,"Good, Inexpensive Bottling System",I purchased this bottling system as part of a Christmas present for my sister's boyfriend and have heard great things back from him. Originally I had purchased the brewing and flavor kits at a retail store and just needed the bottling system to complete the brewing package for him. The bottles are easy to clean and have held up well so far.
5,Works great!,"The bottles arrived promptly and work precisely as expected (I mean, their just plastic bottles after all). They come in a nice, reusable box so that after your beer is bottled, they can then be stored back in the shipping box for further conditioning.Cleaning up after use was easy enough and any sediment from the brew left in the bottom washed out easily and no left over smell. In other, words they clean up real good."
5,Mr. Beer and PETE Reuse,"I've be using Mr.Beer's home brews for a several years and was keeping two kegs going non stop until storage space,at home, ran out. I've used the Mr. Beer PETE #1 bottles, and reused them over and over again without being aware that this was not recommended. Now I've just started up again and am using new PETE #1 bottles and will reuse them I will also build up a stock of 1 liter glass bottles and cap them. This is not because I'm concerned over the reusing the PETE #1 but where I am currently working the import of PETE bottles comes with an excessive import duty along with VAT on cost and courier charges, that makes the used of old glass beer bottles the way to go.Trevor Strong"
3,A little disappointed,I was a little disappointed that the caps for these bottles do not have the pressure release feature that are part of the caps that come with this company's root beer kit.
3,Work in a pinch or new to brewing,"I was given a Mr. Beer Kit as a Christmas present but it does not include bottles. My plan was to buy beer that came in reusable bottles, however I kept putting off buying them, and I had already started brewing a batch. So I got on Amazon and looked around and finally settled on the official Mr. Beer Deluxe Bottling System.For the amateur system that is the Mr. Beer Kit these work fine. I have made two batches in them and they do the job.However I do not plan on using these in the future.If you are new to home brewing these will do the job they are intended for at a good price point. They are a great stop gap while you figure out if you enjoy home brewing with out costing too much money."
3,You need these bottles when you buy the basic Mr. Beer kit,"When you buy the basic Mr. Beer kit you NEED these bottles so if you see first these review buy the kit that comes with the bottles, unless you want to look for bottles on the recycling trash."
3,Beer Bottelng Kit,"I have purchased this for my husband for Christmas, the only thing that I wish it had (which did not have to do with amazon) a funnel to transfer the beer to the bottles."
4,a must.......,Another set of bottles is a must if you want to have a second batch ready before you have a weekend available to empty the first bottles.
2,MR BEER AND PETE #1,"I also got a Mr Beer kit for Christmas and it works fine, my concern is for the recycling stamp on the bottom of the plastic bottles that come with the kit. They are clearly stamped with PETE 1 which is a one time use bottle! I know that MrBeer sez that they can be used over and over again but every web search (at least 12) that I have done clearly states that bottles stamped with PETE 1 should be recycled after one use? If they are to be reused they should have a #2,4 or 5? Whatsup MrBeer???"
2,Quality Control lacking?,"Boy, was I disappointed to see all kinds of air bubbles and imperfections in the plastic. There were even dried white residue spots of some sort on the inside. Regular old soda bottles don't even have these imperfections. If I pay this much for plastic bottles, they better look like new! Whatever happened to quality control?I just don't understand all the high ratings for this product. Maybe all the boxes of bottles I received were from a batch that was not made correctly? I promptly returned these as defective and Amazon was awesome, even sending me a return shipping label.If these bottles would have been pristine like I expected, then I would have given them a higher rating and kept them."
2,For 30 Bucks,"Uhhh People..... For 30 bucks or less you could just buy a case of beer (not twist off), drink it, then use the bottles to brew. Why would you want to pay for a plastic bottle when you could get glass for free with a case or even freer grab the empties at your buddies house."
1,Disappointing,"This is not a ""toy"" but a very good challenge for any architec. I bought it for my 13 year old son and I had to do it by myself. I could only do 70% of it and looked as a real coliseum after an earthquake. The mortar is very rough when an extremely fine one is required because of the size mof the bricks. The instructions are precariuos and lacks of important details an explanations. This is an adult ""toy"" and you need a very long time to finish it."
1,Far too complicated to build for the age range suggested,"My son is a veteran lego builder since an early age. Meccano, Knex, Magneto, the kid can build anything - except this apparently! Way too complicated, fiddly and ultimately unsatisfying to put together. Waste of time, don't buy this."
4,easy to read,I think that the book is for differente people: programmers and marketers. But I found it quite interesting althought you have to select what hacks are appropriate for your job.
5,Best book Gary has ever written,"Not only is this book the best Gary Null has ever written, it is probably the #1 self-help book I've ever reas as well. If you read my reviews, I've read tons of self-help books over the years. I just picked this book up recently and I was blown away. If only I had this book in my possession 5 years ago when it was first written.One extremely interesting concept of many that Gary lays out in this book is about daydreaming. He tells us to keep a log of all of the things we daydream about. Take note of the patterns that develop. Then after reviwing this log, you will be able to decide what you truly want and desire out of life. I've done this, and it literally knocked my socks off. This was just one of the many brilliant exercises laid out in this book.If you have any doubt whatsoever about the state of your mental health, or you just want to open your mind to the endless possibilities there are for us in the world today, read this book. You'll be very glad you did."
4,Excellent debut from a talented prose writer,"Madsen's first-person narrative is more than intense, it is intrepid, a sometimes harsh account of longing/love and how that obsession can spur creative instincts.The novel also doubles neatly as a mini-travel narrative, expanding beyond the cliche story of a young American abroad and a coming-of-age tale. The subjects are complex: art, love, sex and the mix of European culture with young American ennui.I read this novel in one night, devouring the prose. Recommend anyone to do the same."
2,Novelty Wears Off,"This player is very sleek, modern, and entertaining to watch with its cool blue light and sliding glass door. The sound quality is also impressive. One reviewer mentioned that his cat enjoyed it--and after a while I found it was not good for much more than amusing pets. As someone else said, it made perfectly good CD's skip, that did not skip on any other player. If you take a look into the player, you'll see the CD wobbling from side to side as it spins--not good news. If you listen carefully, you'll notice that each song skips at the same part(s) every time you pop in the disc. That's because the bright, shiny, machine has scratched your CD.My advice:Don't buy this because you won't be able to enjoy your CD's on it, or ever again, as it will damage them.If you own it, lock up your CD's until you get this deceptively cute music-eating monster out of your house."
2,Poor Quality Maps,My copy was dated January 1989 and consisted of poor quality black & white maps that looked like they were made on a copy machine. One was so bad it was mostly black smudges. Map orientation in the binding seemed to be random also.
5,Calms Anxiety and Nervousness,"I deal with anxiety daily and have some social phobia because of it. I started taking this on a regular basis, 2-3 times a day and have noticed a significant improvement in how calm I feel. I can interact in social settings and I rarely get worked up any more. When I miss a day of taking these, I can feel the difference. A very good buy for anyone looking for some peace."
3,"Works well, but needs the ""setup tap""","This scale works pretty well. The display is easy to read. However, it needs the ""setup tap"" with your toe to display your weight consistently. Supposedly it doesn't need this, but I found that my weight would be displayed lower each time if I didn't do the tap first. But when I do tap the scale and let it do its little setup thing before stepping on it, it gives my weight very consistently, and is accurate when compared to a medical beam scale that I have access to at work."
5,Outstanding introduction to MPLS - Highly recommended,I found this book to be an outstanding introduction to a very complex - and often misunderstood - technology. Extremely helpful and highly recommended.
4,Complex but not complicated.,"MPLS stands for Multiprotocol Label Switching. It is a complicated system of nodes, networks, allocations, routes, and databases. Rick Gallaher's Guide reads like a Spanish 101 textbook. Yes, it's great to know the difference between a physical, a data link, and network layers, but at the same time, it's a whole lot of material to take in at once. This isn't a book you can cram into your head in one sitting. It requires (as with Spanish 101) a semester to get it right. There are terms you have to practice. Acronyms you have to learn and whole slew of words that aren't exactly the easiest things to remember. That is a fault of the subject matter jargon and not the fault of the manual. Gallaher's Guide is a solid learning tool, and I think would work perfectly with a mentor or as part of an intructional class. By itself, it's more like reading a spanish textbook, without ever hearing the language spoken."
3,"Close, but for this price, no cigar","These are great headphones, and extremely comfortable. But to add real life into your music, especially out of the confines of the clasical genre, grab a pair of Sennheiser HD-600's...The sound those headphones create is near perfection. They are often used as a reference for recording engineers, and audiophiles. The extra [price] is very much worth it. ...these headphones are great for classical music, but if you are primarily a rock listner you might want to check out the Grado SR-325's. I would also recommend going and auditioning this type of headphone before you buy."
3,Not as good as I thought it would be...,"I was pretty disappointed actually, I expected to get a lot of coven information.. what was involved with starting a coven, how to organize groups, and so on.. but basically this book deals with resolving conflicts within a coven.. now that is EXTREAMLY important for coveners but.. not at all what I had expected.. Covencraft by Amber K. is MUCH more detailed.. this book is useful however if you are dealing with jealousy, power struggles, etc. inside your coven.. but other than that.. it was not very helpful.."
2,Discouraging book,"I had high expectations due to the reviews on this book, but was very disappointed with it. The entire time I felt as if I was reading a book about how to run a small greedy country, or a college business text book. What this showed me is that if covens are anything like this, with 80% of it being about power struggles, pecking order and problems within, that my partner and I don't want to be any part of it. I am in an amazing, loving, and very functional partnership, and I believe after reading this, we understand why people don't want to be a part of a larger one. My partner and I will be practicing only among ourselves, and I really do hope that all covens are not as difficult and stressful as this book made them out to be... I most likely won't touch another book by this author, and do not recommend it to anyone. The only parts I enjoyed were the mini-spells, and the quotes from other people in the book."
5,Rio remastered and renewed,"I just purchased my copy of the newly remastered Rio with limited edition packaging. I can't stress this enough, GET THIS PACKAGING! Not only was the CD remastered but the packaging has been as well. The artwork has been rescanned and touched up using original artwork from the album and from the singles, and get this - the lyrics are large and easy to read. The package opens like an old double LP would with pockets on each side, one for the lyric book and one for the CD. Even the CD has it's own sleeve like an old LP. Rio has never sounded richer, the drum tracks jump out of the speakers, and Simon has never been clearer. This CD contains all the original cuts from the original release. The US re-release on LP and cassette contained radio edits, b-side mixes and extended remixes."
2,Problem Pot,"This is an astectily pleasing product, however the thermal carafe pot is a pain. It leaks where the metal and the plastic are joined, and the lid is a pain to get off and on."
1,Poor Engineering or Quality Control,"I purchased one of these recently and it quit in less than a month. When it first quit, it would make about 1/2 pot and quit. After it cooled down, I could restart it and finish the pot. After two or three days, it would turn off within a minute or two of starting it. I called about the warranty and was told that they would send me a new one for $7.50 shipping. I received the new one in about two weeks. It lasted less than one week and began doing the same thing. I notified the warranty people and they said they were turning the problem over to Engineering and Quality Control. It is not worth paying $7.50 shipping to use a pot less than a week."
1,New Model Not an Improvement,"After owning two spacemaker coffeemakers in the past, I went looking for another when mine died. I did not like what I found. The caraffe didn't want to come out with out jerking it, and the top didn't want to come off. It screws on and off - what a dumb idea. There is no heating element, instead, it has a thermal caraffe - which means you can't see how much coffee is left in the caraffe. It only holds 10 cups as opposed to it's predecessor's 12 cups. The removable water tank has a hand ""grip"" instead of a handle which was hard to hold on to empty. I can only imagine what happens when it is full and perhaps a bit wet. Looks to me like the ruined a good thing. What a shame. I won't be buying one of these. I just wish I could find one of the old models."
4,COFFEE MAKER EXPERIENCE,"WE HAVE HAD B & DECKER COFFEE MAKERS FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS. THIS WAS THE HARDEST ONE TO INSTALL, IT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM ANY OF THE PREVIOUS ONES. SO FAR WE ARE HAVING GOOD LUCK, NO LEAKS AND THE TAP IN THE HANDLE IS CONVENIENT. I AM SURPRISED THAT WITHOUT A BURNER THAT THE COFFEE STAYS HOT FOR QUITE A WHILE, I WOULD BUY ANOTHER. BUT I ALSO LIKED THE 325 WHICH WE WERE UNABLE TO GET. B WINTLE."
1,Disappointed,I have been buying space saver coffee makers for the past 25+ years and I have never been so disappointed as I am with this one. After a month of working great it up and decides that we are not going to brew a full pot of coffee. You have to press the on button at least four times to get a full pot of coffee. What's up with this. This is the second pot - I brought the other one back to the store and got this one figuring maybe it was just a glitch with the other one - but no - the same thing happened to this one. What do you suggest I do?
1,Very Unhappy with this B&D Spacemaker...,"My husband purchased this coffee maker for me serveral months ago and I HATE IT! ...I want my old one back, it still worked fine at 4+ years old but I donated it to the homeless shelter! This is my fourth B&D spacemaker, in 12 years and it stinks. Leaks when trying to pour, that is if you can get the lid turned to its proper position(!), the coffee gets cold quickly and on the handle, the door won't stay shut. Rarely is this feature used because of how slow the coffee comes out. It is also a smaller capacity machine than the former ones (10C verses 12 Cups).<br />I have been very dissappointed with this one all around! I have never had any problems w/b&d products before now. Bad Apple this time!! Do not buy!"
1,Don't buy this OR THE NEW ONE,"I had the original for years and yes it was great until it died. The stainless steel carafe was nice, if you didn't want to pour a cup of coffee over the sink (where the other cups drained down while you poured).They now have a ""dripless"" pot - the old good kind and I am happy to say it pours great and does not drip. Unfortunately the basket in the brew unit pops out just enough to back everything up and out all over the counter. I'll never give b&d; my money again.And by the way - I tried to leave b&d; a message at their website, but it requires a ""category"" number that you can't fill in. Nice work b&d.; good bye"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!,"The other reviews cover the details nicely, so I'll just sum them all up with...""this product s**ks"". We replaced our second 'old model' SpaceSaver with this and lived with it 'till it (thankfully) died after 3 years.I was able to find the original 12 cup model, refurbished with a 90 day warranty, on E-Bay for about $50.00, inc. shipping; and I saw one new in the box for about the same price. So if your counter space is at a premium as ours is, try E-Bay. Search ""black and decker coffeemaker"""
1,Yet another dissatisfied consumer!,"I agree with all points listed here...poor design on B&D's part, did they even test this darn thing before shipping it off to the stores?? HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE...I have nothing nice to say other than we get compliments on its appearance which causes me to shriek at unsuspecting guests...""TOO BAD IT SUCKS!!""."
1,Poor Carafe design--NOT WORTH THE PRICE!,"I bought this model, not for the under the counter feature, but for the metal carafe. We have broken so many glass carafes in the past that I wanted to buy one that would last. Now I wish it WOULD break! The only way we can pour coffee without spilling is by taking the whole cover off. The coffee isn't HOT in the carafe, it is lukewarm to midly hot. The gasket on the cover keeps popping off. If we do get the coffee to pour, it leaks down the side and makes a puddle on our counter.We need to clean out the coffeemaker with vinegar often so that the coffee can actually brew.I will go back to buying the $7.00 models and deal with the broken glass every once in a while.The amount of money paid does NOT equal a quality product. Very poor coffeemaker."
1,Please stop before you buy!,"Don't waste your money on this horrible appliance. Does NOT keep the coffee hot. When the coffee is done making, the heat turns off. This stainless carafe doesn't keep the coffee hot and it's very hard to pour without taking the entire top off. Too heavy with the coffee in it. I unfortunately tossed the box and receipt. Black and Decker really screwed up on this one!"
1,Do NOT buy,Terrible coffee maker.exchanged 3 times eventually gave up and bought another brand. I tihnk this was recalled after a while
2,many design flaws,"Black and Decker sent this model as a replacement for another coffee maker of thiers that broke after less than a year of use. This model looks nice but there are three major flaws: 1) When you pour the coffee from the thermal carafe, the pouring spout is soooo small (to keep the coffee hot, supposedly) that it takes forever for the coffee to come out. The spigot you can utilize in the handle while your coffee is brewing? Same problem--the hole is way too small. 2) When the coffee is brewing, it blows steam upwards--not good for wooden cabinets, and 3) The button that you need to press to load/lock in the water holder is cheaply made, I expect it to break within a years time. It's a good thing Black and Decker has a one year warrenty--because I expect this model will also need to be replaced within that time. The engineers really blew it on this one."
2,waste of $$,Do not buy!! I loved my orginal under the counter. This one was difficult to install and you cannot pour a cup of coffee without spilling(unless you remove the lid). If you like warm coffee for several hours you will not have it with this model. The only plus is the coffee seems to taste stronger in this pot.
1,New & Improved--NOT!,"Yes folks, here is another previously very satisfied customer of the B&D Undercounter Spacesaver Coffee maker who bought the new and improved model. I cannot tell you how DISSATISFIED we (EVERYONE who attempts to use it) are with this product. Suffice to say that money is not everything, but until you have your first cup of joe for the day, things just don't seem to go well for you. We usually end up with more coffee on the counter than in the cup - with the inconvient lid screwed on or off."
1,Thermal Carafe & Water Dispenser,"I have been using Black & Decker Spacemaker Coffemakers for 15 years, replacing one when needed. I believe I have purchased 6 for my home and motorhome. I have always been very happy with them until now. The changes that have been made do not improve the product. Amazon very kindly replaced the first one I received as I was not happy with the Thermal Carafe. It takes 5 minutes to pour one cup of coffee. The replacement is exactly the same. The water dispenser does not have a handle which makes it very awkward to carry and slipped from my hand once and dropped on the floor with water everywhere. I called Black & Decker and all they told me was to have it replaced by Amazon and gave me no satisfaction."
2,New Spacesaver Vs. Old Spacesaver,"We had an earlier (perhaps the first) Black&Decker; Spacesaver Coffeemaker and really loved it alot! a 12 cupper, too!But after 15 years, well you know. There wasn't much on the market for spacesaver type coffee makers. So I ordered the new model from Black&Decker.; Only a stainless steel pot available. I can't see how much coffee is left and this model actually turns off after the coffee is brewed and only 10 cups. I can use a glass pot, but it will get cold. The clock is so small that it probably shouldn't even be there. If I didn't need the counter space, I wouldn't have bought it. They should have stayed with the original design (nice sized visable clock).However, my experience with Amazon.com was excellent!"
1,Reply to customer service trouble,"I just wanted to reply to the posts about the customer service - I sent them an e-mail to complain about how terrible this coffee maker was, and ended up getting a full refund, which I hadn't even asked for, I just wanted to tell them how bad it was.They asked me for the purchase price & my receipt, which I e-mailed to them & they sent me a check. They asked me to cut off the plug & mail it in, but I got the check before doing that.You might try sending an e-mail via the Black & Decker web site."
1,This coffee pot stinks,"What a rediculous expensive appliance. This thing was a waste of money. It does not keep coffee warm, it condesate liquids into your cupboards, and it cost too much money. Please trust me do not buy this silly contraption"
3,Nice Idea - Poor Design,"Good things - Never have to worry about forgetting to turn it off since it is really never on. No heating element under carafe. It goes under cabinets and doesn't take up that much space.Bad Things - Installation - Designed to have the screws that hold it to the cabinet go up leaving a length of screw inside your cabinet (instead of down leaving only a counter sunk screw). Coffee doesn't pour well out of carafe; top has to be mostly removed. Directions are very poor, especially about operation. We didn't know it didn't stay on like a normal coffee maker. If you drink coffee all morning, then this one really isn't for you since it won't keep it warm very long."
1,Bad Design,"We got this coffeemaker for Christmas and my wife couldn't turn the lid on the pot to pour the coffee, this is a poor design. I even had a hard time getting the lid in the right position to pour coffee and the coffee does not stay hot that long. We returned the coffeemaker."
1,DON'T BUY THIS COFFEEMAKER!!!,"Like others who've commented here, I loved my old B&D Spacemaker. Wished I'd come to Target's website before I bought this version. All other comments at the site are correct. B&D needs to redesign this one FAST! After all the hassle of getting this one installed, now I have to get it OUT! Haven't a clue what I'll get now. :-((("
1,DO NOT BUY,"This coffee maker is a piece of junk... every single thing on it leaks.. leaks when it brews, leaks when you pour. Contacted Black & Decker and no response."
1,My fury is brewing!,"I usually love Black & Decker products, but this coffeemaker is the worst possible design imaginable! The thermal carafe doesn't keep the coffee nearly warm enough, plus you can't see how much coffee is left. The lid leaks and pours ever so slowly. The water reservoir leaks all over the place when you set it up to automatically brew. The pot is difficult to clean and the coffee basket stained on the first use. We usually love B&D products, but we'll think long and hard before we purchase another coffeemaker from them!"
1,Really BAD Coffeemaker,"The worst coffeemaker I've ever had. B & D have come out with some decent electronics in the past, but this is an exception. It is ungainly to handle and hard to wash. Unless you want to just unscrew & take the lid off the thermal pot, be prepared to wait a bit to pour yourself some coffee; The ""sneak a cup"" feature in the handle barely offers a trickle. I get about two successful pots of coffee for every five brewed. If all or part of the water is drawn out of the resevoir successfully, it is blown out the top as steam. This makes for soaked cabinets and countertops. Sometimes it just shuts off before all the water has gone through. If you want to try one, be sure the store from which you buy it will swap it out for another brand. Sorry B&D... It's the truth."
3,it is good for dry skin,I am an Asian and my skin type is mix. I think the lotion is too thick to my face. But it is good to use it as body lotion since the area I stay is very dry.
3,There are better books on the topic,"This book starts off with making comparisons between being overweight and having a house that's too stuffed with things.It continues to trying to work that theme on and off though out the book with little effect.While there are things in here that people will find helpful the book wanders off into information onhow to re-organize, clean and store things rather than dealing with the real problem of people having too much stuffand enabling them to get rid of it.I prefer Don Aslett's ""For Packrats Only: How to Clean Up, Clear Out and Dejunk Your Life Forever"".The Aslett book deals with the causes of clutter and busts the excuses that people use to hang onto stuff."
1,decluttter your home?,"I thought the decorating ideas in this book were TACKY! I would never use any of them in my home. I got the feeling this author was on a publishers ""payment due timeline"" and had no idea about the inside of a home. Martha really has raised the bar. This book was a disappointment."
2,Big disappointment,"We bought this toaster oven last summer. We were replacing our old toaster oven, which was still in good working condition, however, my wife wanted a new one. We settled on this on because it was bigger than our old one, and looked more modern. We saw that it had a digital display and figured it was a step up from our old one which had a turn knob. Upon bringing it out of the box we saw that it was quite complicated to using. You have to select your choice of toast, bake, broil, etc.. and always hit the start button. At first it was annoying, since we were so used to just turning the a knob to the desired temp. Also, when you go to toast bread, it takes so long, about 7 to 9 minutes at the medium setting. I think if I had to do it over again, I would have researched more, rather than buying on looks alone."
1,"Beep, Beep, Beep",The noise this toaster made was to much to tolerate. Still searching for the perfect toaster.
1,No stars if possible,"Run for your lives! This is the worst impulse buy Ive possibly ever made. Ive returned it before someone gets really hurt. The thing gets frighteningly hot, and you have to have it firmly secured to the surface somehow, without it abutting a wall to keep it in place just so you can push the idiotic buttons with which you must operate it. To make it worse, once you open the oven door to take a peek, you have to restart every cycle with the same stupid routine on the impossible buttons. Your options - burn a hole in the wall behind the unit, or glue it to the counter, or try to steady it somehow with your hands while you hope that the controls work. Unbelievable what a POS this thing is. Im appalled. For $80, you should get so much more, but this thing is obviously a compromise, in all the worst ways. I cant say how just how disappointed I am. wow...."
2,outside exterior very hot!!,"We had bought this product and returned it. It was very hot to the touch when it was in use, could easily burn anyone's hand or arm if accidentally touched it. That's a big safety issue especially for anyone who has children in their household. I do not recommend this specific toaster oven. I have however used other Black and Decker products and they have worked out fine."
1,Very Dangerous Appliance,"Do not buy this appliance. Even one star is over-rated. My wife has already burned herslf several times as the hot wire rack literally flew out of the oven. This happens if you pull the rack about 1/3 of the way out of the oven to remove hot food. Also, when non-convection baking for longer than 20 minutes, the convection fan comes on by itself, but the fans blades sound like a scraping on something, making a ringing noise. We bought this oven to replace a DeLonghi that failed after 2 years, big, big, mistake in not buying another DeLonghi."
3,the pizza tray,"The previous caution about the pizza tray are valid for the tray I received. All trays may not be the same. On the underneath outer edge roll from the die cut, although tucked in, is sharp enough to cut one's finger especially a little tyke's if they pick up the tray and get their finger in the lip.<br />So far, and the unit is new to us still, all the good reports appeared to have merrit. The instuctions are extremely weak and . . . how do we cook in a convection toaster oven? A small cook book suggestion for beginners would definitely be a PLUS for us."
2,Does not hold up,"I have been a Black and Decker user for years. When my old oven died finally, I purchased one of these digital-advantage ovens. It was hard to learn to use because the manual is virtually worthless, but once you master the buttons it is great. As long as it works. Unfortunately for me, mine did not work long. The convection fan died shortly after the warranty expired. You can't order parts and the customer service site did not respond to my email. Without the convection fan you are limited to 400 degrees, which is not enough for some applications."
4,"Some quirks, BUT I like it","Some of the faults: The pizza pan is sharp on the underside, so be careful. The rack comes out really easy. I was trying to slide some toasted subs out and the rack came out with it. The controls are a pain at first, but now I can set them with my eyes closed. It is hot, however I haven't burnt myself since I paid attention to another review of this toaster oven.<br />Some good points: It's relatively easy to clean. I use it mostly to toast things or to bake chicken. It works great for those things. I put a thick piece of frozen bread in there on 5 and it comes out perfect. The chicken ALWAYS comes out pleasantly moist when completely cooked. There is no way I want to replace this toaster oven."
1,Exploding Glass Door,"About a month after buying this product, its glass door EXPLODED, showing our counter with beads of glass.Like the Toastmaster oven (which has the same documented problem), this product is dangerous. Don't buy it."
2,okay but not much,"The book is okay but it did not have much substance. The chapters were very short for this paperback book. No graphs or pictures. Try others by Freifertig and Nassar, but be warned these too did not have much substance. For 1/3 the cost it would be worth the two excellent short chapter on psychology of trading. For the full cost you can get both others."
1,A mediocre book..and a grossly overpriced one at that,"As a full-time, moderately successful on-line day trader, I'm always open to new strategies, ideas and insights. Any edge means money in my pocket. I found little of any value in this book, that is not readily available, more clearly explained, from a myriad of sources. Further, for what is being offered, the price of this book is, let us not mince words here, an outrage."
5,Great insights into trading successfully,"I recently came across a very interesting book that would be a very valuable resource for day traders. ""Day Trading into the Milennium"" is written by Michael Turner, himself a very successful day trader. It de-mystifies many of the inner workings of the stockmarket and has some great insights into trading successfully. I strongly recommend you check it out"
5,Very insightful book.,"I have read only three books on trading, each of which was informative in its own way. What I like about this book is the way the author steps through each aspect of day trading. He has an easy to read and understand writing style. Overall, I give it two thumbs up."
2,what a disappointment.,"I ordered the book mainly because of the hype i have read about it. I awaited with great anticipation for delivery of this so called ""bible"". Upon delivery I realized how thin and tiny this manual was. I read it immediately and further discovered it is for beginners and offers nothing extraordinary for those wishing to find an edge in this highly competitive and cutthroat business. The contents are simply common sense approaches. Thanks for nothing!"
2,A great disappointment,"With all the high praise given to this book, I had expected much more from such a thin volume for such a high price. This is definitely a manual for the beginning day-trader, not for one with any experience at all. The trading strategies outlined by the author are ones I have used long before reading this book. They are based on common sense."
5,"ideal tv,great price","i seached hi and lo for tv to fit our needs for our rv,something that had to fit in a small closed in area was hard to find when looking for ac/dc.We not only found it here ,price was great,the service was #1,and the tv has a great picture quality."
5,The best of the best - if you even LIKE brit funk or level42,Then this is a MUST HAVE2 of their best albumns for a low price and remastered to boot!True colors sports the bands best lyrical albumn and world machine thier most popular (barring RITF)Truly a great combo!
4,"Good brand, good price, good product","I bought my HD 433s in Jan. 01 and I have no complaints. The sound quality is very good and the design is above average. I also like that it comes with an adapter, the cord is long and the phones themselves are not over-the-ear. I use them at work, so I appreciate being able to hear some outside noise if somebody is trying to get my attention. It makes it a little harder to tune out the world completely unless you're in a quiet room, so if you're looking for sound immersion, I'd go with an over-the-ear design."
4,Best sound for the money!!,"The first thing I did after opening the box was to plug these headphones into my newer discman, which is the Sony D-EJ615. The sound is good, strong and full, but the bass is too heavy, the treble was too weak, and that muddied up the sound. Dissappointed, I tried them with my home stereo, and also my older discman (circa 1996). On these, the sound is beautiful and clear, I'm listening to Kid A and hearing textures that I didn't hear before.I don't know much about audio electronics, but I'm guessing that my newer discman isn't giving the headphones enough power. So beware if you're buying these headphones for a mobile device.One other small thing, the reason why I'm giving the HD433 four stars instead of five. The headphones clamp around the ears rather tightly, and can become uncomfortable after wearing for extended periods."
2,"Sadly, little better than...","the cheapo headphones that come with CD players these days. I suppose given their low price there's no reason to quibble about the lack of quality sound. Suffice it to say you get what you pay for: these sound like inexpensive headphones. No high end, no bass, and no space. To top it off the supra-aural design is uncomfortable for any prolonged listening. If you are looking for a step up, the HD433s just ain't it."
2,A low end high-end,"Got these for CA$50. First impression: poor material and build quality for a Sennheiser. The headband is a cheap-looking, poorly molded plastic piece, got rather sharp material leftovers along edges. Had to arm myself with a pen knife and spent half an hour removing and smoothing those. The speakers don't hold in place well, so frequent re-adjusting is needed. Sound quality is ok, nothing extraordinary, rather flat and dry; I get a better response from my old $20 Radioshack pieces. Cord length (some 10 ft) is a plus, but there is no volume control on the cord. To sum up: cheap headphones from a reputable manufacturer. Want to flash the Sennheiser logo --- go and buy these, otherwise I guess you can get a better bang for $50."
5,Very Nice Headphones for the Price,"I purchased these headphones for home use with my Sony Walkman CD player. I would rate the sound quality as very high. They are much, much better sounding than the standard issue headphones that come with most personal listening devices. They fit snuggly, but not too tightly as to be uncomfortable, even for extended periods. The cord is nice and long and thicker than most, so it doesn't tangle. My cord attaches to both earpieces, not just the left earpiece, but this is not a problem. I would not recommend purchasing these if you intend to use them while exercising, jogging, ect., because they are too large and would be too hot. These headphones seem to be a very good value given their price."
4,Great for the Money I spent,"How good your headphones will sound depends a lot on the system you plug it into. This above all things is important when looking at the darn things. If you try to plug these into a $15 cd player, they will sound awful. When hooked to a fine system, they are absolutely fantastic.1.They are really light. 2. THe cord is super long 3. They deliver great bass but can still do justice to classical and jazz4. The foam cushion can be uncomfortable at times. 5. THEY PRODUCE CRISP SOUND.I would suggest spending more money for the hd500 series. They are a lot more comfortable. THese are really good for walking around town with."
1,"Awful, Simply Awful!!!",I don't know about the rest of you but these headphones sounded awful and became very uncomfortable. I do not reccomend them to anyone!
2,"Good sound, but I want more.","These are great sounding headphones -- I have no complaintwith their sonic qualities. I have a minor complaint withthe quantity, however. I don't know if it's because it takesmore juice to drive the larger coils in these, or if headphonesare now made so that they can't damage your ears by gettingtoo loud, but these headphones are not loud enough. My old[cruddy] Sony's are significantly louder with the same drivingsource. I recognize that this is generally not a characteristicthat is important for most headphone buying folk. But I wearheadphones when I practice my drums, and when I wear these,I can't hear the music over the din of my banging. In otherrespects, these are a fine pair of headphones and reproducemusic into your ears very well."
2,Little Better Than Stock Headphones,Was expecting better given the Sennheiser name. These are on par with the headphones Panasonic or Aiwa package with their mid-line CD players. Sold mine on eBay. Am utterly bewildered by the 5 Star reviews!
4,"Good cheap 'phones, but a can be a bit uncomfortable","Fine sound (excellent treble - you can hear that ""snap"" of acoustic guitar strings, or cymbals), and they also definitely enhanced the reception of my pocket radio.The adjustments are unconventional, so it took me some time to find the best setting to fit my head, and until then, my ears complained after only 10 minutes. Since then, an hour or so is feasable...but they still clamp down hard.I can recommend them heartily to those of you in colder climates, bedause they cover the entire ear, and would be serve as musical earmuffs when it gets below freezing outdoors."
1,complete waste of money,"If you just love Fear Factor and want to see lots of background material on the women and their Playboy magazine photo shoot, go ahead and buy this DVD. But be warned that there is probably more footage of their boyfriends or husbands than there is of them nude."
1,This DVD is utterly a WASTE OF Time.,"The girls here are pretty, I will admit that. BUt they all come out with their husbands and boyfriends and show very little for the camera. They about their experience on Fear Factor, which is not very fun cause most of these girls are bimbos who probably dropped out of college due to their low IQs. MOst of them are very snobby and try and pretend that they are giving you a very ""tasteful"" photo shoot, Which is BS cause they all have tattoos and are taking their clothes off in front of strangers in public."
1,WTF were they thinking???,sorry... but this sounds like the dumbest idea ever... waste of time... waste of money...
2,Broken after 5 months,"I was impressed with the attractive appearance and quite impressive sound from this unit. However, the CD player stopped working after 5 months; thus, I can't recommend this product."
1,CD motor is too loud,"I was very impressed when I first tried this product. The blue display is awesome, and the system itself is very sharp with its clean lines. My amazement ended when I played a cd. The motor in the CD player is extremely loud. Anyone who plays their music rather low, or below the volume level 15 will hear a very noticeable sound.I will be returning this stereo as soon as possible. For anyone who is looking for an executive minisystem, I recommend the JVC FS 6000, 7000, or 8000. (They are all basically the same except the 6000 and 7000 models are older) I recently used a 6000 model and I loved it. Unlike the JVC FS- SD7, the JVC FS 6000's CD motor was very quiet."
4,Big sound in a chic package.,JVC has always represented quality in high-fidelity components.This is a great example of what JVC engineers and designers can do.The FSSD7 system fuses the baby boomers nostalgia for spinning LP's and the latest digital CD technology.As you listen to your latest favorites you will also be pulled in by the visual excitement of the top loading CD player.The quality of the sound reproduction in an ultra-sleek package makes this one of the best values in this category.
1,Misleading picture,"I bought this thinking is was the trademarked Tiffany Perfume but it's actually Tiffany by ""Tiffany for Women"" (whoever that is). The perfume that arrived was not the perfume that was pictured. I returned the perfume per the seller's instructions and I'm awaiting a credit. I think you should show a picture of the product you're selling not the product you're emulating."
5,Something different,"Never played the battle network series, but starforce is fun, unique battle system keeps you active.Story is nothing really special, but its captivating, funny at times, yet i havent finished it quite yet.if you're a megaman fan like me, just give it a try."
1,"Great music, lousy format!","I love the music, but was VERY unhappy to be unable to play this CD on my computer. The DVD side works okay, but I can't load this to itunes on my macintosh. And I can't load the DVD to my computer and store this disk at home. If I had it to do over, I'd buy the plain vanilla CD!"
3,Not so great-check out a pair of Grados,"I didn't purchase these. I only tried them out at a HiFi store. While they weren't bad, they weren't great either. I ended up buying a pair of Grado SR-80's for $83 which blew all of the Sennheisers out of the water. The padded phones and strap are extremely comfy on the Sennheiser HD570s, but the sound just isn't there compared to Grados. The thing that I noticed is a little whoosh while listing to these. The large phones kind of give a seashell over the ear effect. Also, the sound wasn't nearly as clear or bright or strong on these as on the Grados.I would strongly advise anyone who is shopping for a nice pair of earphones and cares about sound quality to at least LISTEN to a pair of Grados before you buy anything else."
2,Volume cranked but still too quiet,"As many reviews here have stated, these headphones are simply WAAAAYYYY too quiet. I've used them with my Sony home theater system, iTunes on my PC, on my iPhone, my son's iPod, and his keyboard. All sources are just super quiet with these headphones and you have to crank the volume all the way up just to have halfway decent volume. I'm not looking for ear-splitting volume but when you have to struggle just to hear dialogue or all the elements of a good piece of music, something's wrong.This is disappointing because these headphones are extremely comfortable. Too bad."
3,"Sound OK, but way too fragile","These headphones are really comfortable, and sound OK, but the cord they come with is really awful. The 1/8"" -> 1/4"" adapter is flaky, and started giving me problems almost from the beginning. Also, the cord is really thin, so it tends to get wrapped up on everything. And the other day, the right side just stopped working. I can't recommend these headphones..."
2,Maybe it's just me but...,"I have owned several pairs of Sennheiser phones over the last 20 years and have been quite happy with them. I recently purchased the HD570 however and was not impressed. In fact, I am returning the item. The bass seemed muddy and the treble muted. I tired them with my PC and regular stereo system and compared them to the $$$ Sony phones that came with the PC. I prefered the Sony in each case. They did seem like they would be quite comfortable however."
3,Classical music 5 stars...anything else 2,"I should have tested these headphones before buying them. If you only listen to classical music in quiet surroundings, these are great headphones. If you listen to music with ANY bass you will be returning these in short order. The bass is horrible, but these were not designed for it. Also, the open design does not shield you from any outside noise which is very annoying unless you are home with the door shut. If you listen to many different kinds of music, I would recommend the Bose TriPort headphones. The sound is very impressive and the bass is full without distortion except at very high volumes."
2,Too treble to be a top one,"This headphone is far from satisfactory, especially for me,because I listen to violin a lot. The high is treble like needle, which is rather disturbing. Although the total balance is fairly good, the over-bright feature repels me a lot.Seriously, I do NOT recommend HD570 for classical music lovers."
2,Pooly made and over hyped,"Ok, so I buy these expensive headphones thinking I'm going to get the creme of the crop, but alas they are made of very flimsy plastic! Sound wise they were OK, but my pair of sony MDR-V600's was just as good!"
4,Just In,"My new 570's just arrived, and even not burned in - but they are quite something.- You will hear details and weaknesses in the material that you did not hear before.- You will like the comfort!- You will find the highs a bit exagerated. (for those loosing hearing in the high end, this would be a bonus)- You will find that a weak amp will make them sound like a tweeter... no base or midrange at all!- You will find that nothing else in the price range offers this detailed sound. They are selling these at such a low price I suspect they are clearing out old inventory from a warehouse.Whether live or in the studio, you have to worry about pronounced ""S"" sounds, they can be harsh. Well, the 570's make some recordings sound like they didn't DeEss well enough."
3,"A mixed bag depending on what you call ""heavy"" or ""metal""","It's amazing a compilation filled with so much trend metal can have a lot of great stuff on it too. While there is a load of garbage from Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, P.O.D., and Coal Chamber, there are some surprising bands on here I thought I'd never see on a mainstream release like Amorphis, Nevermore, Neurosis, Nothingface, and Motorhead. The standout trakcs are from those bands and Monster Magnet's excellent cover of Iggy & The Stooges ""Gimme Danger"" and Megadeth's cover of ""Anarchy in the U.K."" from their ""So Far, So Good, So What!"" album, and Sevendust's live version of ""Black"" is good too and captures them perfectly live. All in all a mixed bag depending on your tastes."
3,The Hard + The Heavy Vol. 1,"Bought it at Wal-Mart for $5.88. Good price for the music, as there's quite a mix. Some of the tracks aren't my bag (the introduction was, IMO, unnecessary; Kid Rock is, IMO, best taken in small doses, and this wasn't really his best song). But, hey... 30 songs for under $6 (just 20 per song) was a bargain if I didn't even like half of them."
2,A bummer from the bargain bin,"i bought this for like three bucks becuz it had queens of the stone age and monster magnet covering ""gimme danger"" by the stooges on it. too bad the rest was just a bunch of nu metal bands with dredlocks and jumpsuits.the qotsa song was good though...."
2,The Stoner's Fully Support This Effort,"Since there are only a few good songs, I'll keep it short. This is not a good compilation at all, because of the mixing of stoner rock bands with goth and nu-metal bands. What is the point of doing this? To expose stoner metal itself to the public? Quite disturbing. On the other hand, Monster Magnet lays out one of its best tracks yet, while Rob Zombie and crew rage through another sludge fest remix. Queens of the Stone Age and Fu Manchu do seem out of place, but they still have very awesome tracks that rock hard but keep the heaps of fuzz coming. I'm sorry I can't say the same for the rest of it. Altogether, the whole foundation weakens and screws up the entire thing. Just buy the good albums, okay?"
3,Decent,"I have to agree with the snapper dude, some(actually most) of the songs aren't hard or heavy at all, like putting videodrone on the ""heavy"" part of the set, I mean, what the hell were they thinking? Other than that, some songs were pretty cool, like the live version of ""Black"" by Sevendust. If you like the mainstream type of rock, I guess you'll like this, but if you like the real heavy stuff, skip it, it ain't worth 20 bucks."
2,a bummer from the bargain bin,i bought this for like three bucks becuz it had queens of the stone age and a stooges cover by monster magnet on it. too bad the rest of this was just a bunch of nu metal bands with dredlocks and jumpsuits....the qotsa song was good though
3,It's Okay,"This is basically a collection of music already released. I own almost all of disc 2, plus about half of disc 1. I did enjoy Grip Inc. and Queens of the Stone Age and will definately check them out. Besides being chock full of downright amazing bands (Videodrone, One Minute Silence, Puya) it has three of the worst bands I've ever heard, Megadeth (just too old), Kid Rock (the meathead poser), and P.O.D.(diss buddhists). I love the Monster Magnet song and I'm wondering why this one wasn't on Powertrip. I also like the Rob Zombie remix, and I think it's way better than the original version. Pick this up, but make sure it's at a good price."
1,Save your money or buy something else!,"This one should have a money back guarantee! I expected hard and heavy music but got ripped off instead. This set is just a big advertisement of different artists. Lastly, you will not find any Metallica on this one. Hard and Heavy? No Metallica?"
3,Would be wonderful if wasn't delivered in pieces,"I think this product is lovely and of good quality. However, I've ordered it twice and each time it arrived broken. Very poorly packed. It's not worth it."
2,"Honestly, I don't know what to say, because I received the wrong figure. It wasn't even close.","It must have been quite a ""Krazy Kick"" because it changed his gender as well as his clothes. I got a Cassandra Figure from Soul Calibur. I dunno........I'm stumped. Sorry I can't review the sanji figure better. I would if I actually got one."
3,Going Downhill.,"The Episodes in the ""Teens"" are probably the fall down part of the Gatchaman series, The episodes on Collection 2 are not as fun and exciting as Collection 1. For me it's because there's really no fighting action just God Phoenix VS Galactor Mecha. I rather see them infiltrate Galactor bases and beat the crap outta the bad guys. Still, there are quite a few highlight episodes but they are HEAVILY surrounded by boring episodes.Highlight Episodes-The Fearsome Icekander-Speed Race Through Hell-Who Is Sosai X?-The Great Insect Operation-The Neon Giant Who Laughs At The DarkIf you're a BIG fan of BOTP and G-Force I recommend this for the nostalgia. I'm 100% sure that Collection 3 has alot of more fun and exciting episodes so be sure to pick that up after you get done watching Collection 2!"
3,Good Book on a Much Neglected Health Problem,"I recently read about parasite infections in First Magazine. In the magazine, it is stated that a person just needs to follow the author's herbal medicine protocol to rid the body of parasites. It came as a surprise to me that lots of pharmaceuticals were offered up as treatment in this book.Overall, the book was well written, researched and easy to read. The reader will get an in depth description of the various types of parasites, their symtoms, their geographical region and treatment. Also covered is ways of living to prevent parasite infections in the first place.Everyone should read a book on this subject. I think lots of parasite infections are diagnosed as other things."
5,A Marvelous Handbook for Every Home,"After studying this subject for years we were thrilled to find this book. It is a concise presentation of the very real parasite problem in America. Congratulations to Ann Louise Gittleman, author, for this masterpiece and for putting it in layman's language. We often recommend it to audiences in our health seminars."
3,Disturbing paranoia.,"This book contains some interesting statistics and information on the varying types of parasites. However I was disturbed by the glaring insensitivity to minorities, gays, and just about anyone not white and from America. This book seems to point the finger at anyone born abroad or perhaps has alternative sexual preferences. After trying to get past the offensiveness/paranoia it then became clear that all one has to do is to follow the ideas of the many other doctors who write simply about modifying our diets given the social and economic pressures to prevent such disease."
4,Firmin,"The look of the book alone should be enough get you to pick it up. I decided to finish this on my lunch at work but had a tough time because people kept commenting on the large bite mark in the side of it. This is the tale of Firmin, a rat born in the basement of a Boston bookshop. The runt of the litter, Firmin never gets any food so he starts eating the books in the basement. Soon his love of books stops him from eating literature in favor of reading it. This quirky little book will speak to other bibliophiles who like Firmin, often find themselves lost in fiction while the world races by around them."
5,Ratatouille for the literate adult,"I've just finished reading this title, and can honestly say it will stay with me much longer than it took to read it... it's that good! I hope everyone finds the time to read and appreciate this extraordinary book. I know I'll be re-reading it from time to time for the pure joy of it. Thank you Mr. Savage... (and Firmin)."
5,The work of a genious,"Sam Savage is a genious. There are few books that can be with you for your hole life, and Firmin is ONE OF THOSE books. A read with diferent levels, a masterpiece for all ages. A great fable, a good fun, an outstanding tragedy. Read."
5,A perfect book,"This is indeed a perfect little (150 ish) pages.It was a delightful romp, a read-aloud adult bedtime treat and had an unexpected, unpredictable storyline. I like being surprised by a book and this one did just that.I saw it as a love story; love for literature and the longings it can engage, love for life with all its heartbreak.I will, no doubt, reread this with pleasure, every so often."
1,Have to pay extra for using,"There is a limited number of days that this program keeps functional. There is a limit to the number of mailing labels that can be printed. Also, the program constantly advertise the company's other products."
2,"Has some truth, but hokey","I've read this and it does have alot of truth in it, but also alot of junk, imo. My overall impression was that it's just too lame, too hokey, too much wishful thinking. They have obviously missed the point that it's a harvest of SOULS. For a much better, more serious, and higher calibre work, read the Law of One series. Now THOSE are the real deal!"
1,Do not buy from Interstate Supplies and Services!,"""THANK YOU A-to-Z Guarantee Claim! Had it not been for Amazon's help in settling my claim with the seller Interstate Supplies and Services, I would have been out $26.24. The problem arose because the seller listed and advertised a Briggs and Stratton fuel pump, but substituted an unknown Proven Parts #30 Made in China fuel pump. I would recommend finding another seller to give your business to!"""
4,Smooth sound,"I use the headphones with my Frontier Labs MP3 player while I'm working out at the gym. I've used the original headphones that came with the player as well as other headphones from Sony and Aiwa. The Sennheisers are by far the best and smoothest sounding ones and the bass is very strong and controlled. Given the size and price of the phones, I feel that they are an excellent value."
3,Not a great read,Perhaps it's because this is old information to me but I found this book to be tedious and rather uninteresting. I must admit I stopped reading it and put it up for sale. But this is just my personal opinion. Others may find it very useful. I certainly do believe in value added selling.
2,Value-Added Selling,"Some good points, but it would have been better presented with less of an ""I"" perspective. (Way too many references to ""I did this"" and ""I did that"".) Too many chapters devoted to ""Sales 101"". The type of instructional information is available in other publications. This book was supposedly written to cover Value-Added selling, not selling in general."
3,Great content shaby book,Like the content. But needs a value added hardcover printer. You open the book and right away the spine breaks wherever you open it at. Very sad. If you cant make a quality hardcover then stick with the soft cover.Strange that he talks so much about value but then uses a shabby printer to print his book. I would have paid a couple extra dollars for better quality.I do admit that the contents are great. Would buy again
5,Excellent product,"I have tried lots of different treats for my bird, but he seems to like these best and the price can't be beat."
3,Lisle 10900,I have not used this item at this tine but perhaps later in the week it apears to be of marginal quality.
4,Not as good as World Machine but still above average,"Running In The Family is the better of these two with the strongest lineup including the Gould brothers. I grew up with songs like ""Lessons In Love"", the title track and ""To Be With You Again"" so it's nice to hear them remastered.Staring At The Sun is a little patchy but still has some strong points like the single ""Heaven In Your Hands"".Nice packaging and bonus mixes make this a good buy for a fan or new listener."
5,Toronto 2001,It is a excellent book to help plan your first trip to Toronto. All the major items of importance are included with many color pictures. I would highly recommend it to any one who plans a trip to the big and beautiful city of Toronto. The only improvement would be a little larger print.
5,"Beautiful true cobalt blue, Lovely!","Amazon is the place for these, believe me I checked everywhere, this is the best price for these classic Kaj Frank glasses."
2,Has no effect on anxiety,"A friend recommended this as a treatment for anxiety.I've taken this several times on days I expected to be anxious, and it had no effect that I could tell. I also tried it for sleeping and it had no obvious effect."
3,Still waiting,"I have been taking skullcap as I read that it was a anti spasmodic and I am have seen any results yet. In fact, I had seizures. I have epileps and bought this and I have seen any results yet."
2,Nice in concept ....,"I had to purchase this book for a class at Lansing Community College, and have had nothing but problems. The examples are unclear and overly wordy. The number of typo's and other errors in this book are unforgivable, and it appears to have been rushed to publication.It would have been a nice addition to see some kind of hints given for the end of chapter exercises, and the number of records you would find in a properly created query, especially since later exercises build off a query from Chap 2.If you have to use this book for a class, you may want to buy another book as an additional reference."
1,Unfortunately Required,"This book is required for a database class in the Business School at UMD. Unless you're required to buy it, stay away! This book is ridden with typos, poor style, and stupid examples. This book was obviously rushed to market in the hopes that it would be required material for DB classes."
3,Too wordy and too much errors,"The instructions of the book are unclear, and all exercises of each chapter was build on previous chapters. so if you make mistakes on one step on chapter 5, it can grow into a big problem in chapter 9 or 10. Unless you need it for a college class, stay away. If you need it for a college class unfortunately, you may want buy a second book that teaches intro to MS Access."
4,"Great sound & value; short cables, bright LED","These speakers sound great, look good, and overall I think they're a good value. I like the volume & bass adjustments on the subwoofer. However, the cables are too short to put the subwoofer to the side of my TV, with speakers on either side. I think they're 3 feet long for each component, they should be at least 6'. Also, there is a superbright blue LED on the front of the subwoofer. I'm tempted to cover it up with tape or desolder it. It lights up the entire room like a night light when the lights are off. Somewhat overkill."
2,DONT WASTE YOU MONEY,I thought I was stepping up from my Cyber Acoustics Subwoofer Satellite System (CA-3602) & I already gave it away. BIG MISTAKE....The ca-3602 is only 38 watts compared Cobys 75 watt piece of crap. Its bass is flat an truly isn't worth the 28.00 cash they want.I hooked it to both my mp3 player ten computer & its terrible. Since I live on a fixed budget I have to use it for a month but then I'll be buying another CA-3602.
4,coby speaker system,"when i first opened the box i was very disapointed , i oredered under a search for home theater systems, not computer monitors. but when i hooked them up i was amazed. = i had to move intop an apartment and i was playing them about halfway up and got 2 complaints in the first 20 minutes from neighbors whop said they felt the bass. i recommend it highly for an apt. i am an audiophile/ exrecording engoneer so i know what im talking about"
1,Sounded OK until it died!,Bought this system for my boyfriend. The first one we got had an annoying buzzing sound that no matter what we did never went away. Returned it for a new one. This one worked for less than 3 months and then all of the sudden died. We had listened to it less than a dozen times!!!! Since it was within warranty I tried to contact Coby about the matter but they never responded back to me. No matter how many times I tried to get them to help me fix this system they never helped me. If you want a product that lasts for a few months than this will work but if you actually want to get your money's worth STAY FAR AWAY from this brand because they don't care about you as a customer and have unreliable products.
4,good for the money,for the money i have found that it is very good. though you cant use it at full bass for a long time without it becoming distored it works very well if you turn the bass down a little.
3,mmm,they have a good sound but 2 weeks after i bought this speakers they broken one speaker and that sucks !
3,"Sounds decent, but not 75 watts decent...","I'm happy with the Coby CS-MP77. It sounds really nice. The 75 watt thing is misleading, it is 20 watts per channel with 10%THD for the satellite speakers, and 35 watts for the base box with 10%THD. It is more like a 5 watt system, but good enough for the average room unless you want very high volume."
4,smooth,"great speakers with amazing sound quality works on anything that uses an headphone jack like my desktop,laptop,tv,mp3 etc the look is also stylish and great.pros:sound,look,works on any devicecons:when touching the connect cord the sound gets ashy but thats minor issue just leave the dang cord alone lol"
2,LESS THAN .....,this unit sounds good but is far less than you would expect from advertisement on the box and amazon! it is NOT 75 WATTS! this is the peak power sum of all speakers which has nothing to do with the actual power (RMS) which is 6 W for the subwoofer and 5W x2 for the left and right. now the sound quality is fair for the price but i had a Cyber Acoustic before this unit which was better at the same cost....... especially the subwoofer. the real flaw with this unit however is the cheap and irreplaceable cable which connects the input source to the unit (line in) - less than a month of use and it's already having shortage episodes. and it is fixed so you can't replace it....... DUMB! and also it is ridiculously short........ WTF?i think if the advertisement was more accurate i would give a 3 star but the line input really is inexcusable.
3,not practicable for use with a pc,"I bought these to use with my pc. not a good setup, the cords are very short only three feet and everything must go through the subwoofer. The power button is located on the back of the subwoofer. I tried to hook the unit up to my pc anyway and it just didnt workout because of the short cords and the location of the power switch. The sound is pretty good for such an inexpensive setup I'm keeping them to use with my MP3 player."
3,Good for the price,"straight to the point, ok volume level, ok low end, oveall not bad . 2 problems, the sound donesn't seem to be balanced(not much mid-range) and the cables are short, but for the price, it's ok"
2,"So far two Coby purchases and both poor, poor performance with sound quality","First I purchased the TV and when I received it, the sound was so poor I had to purcahse speakers with hopes to improve. My 9"" TV had three times the sound. So I purchased Coby speakers thinking they would compliment one another. I was wrong. I originally had 10 watt speakers hooked to it. The Coby speakers were 75 watts. The 10 watt speakers blew the Coby speakers out of the water and they were bad. Never, ever will I purchase another Coby. Lessons learned."
1,DOES NOT DELIVER!!,"Since these are powered speakers I assumed that regardless of the input device, they would deliver an appropriate and adequate sound level. Ahh, not so, Grasshopper. With the matching Coby MP3 player I got them for, it delivers a whisper compared to what they do if I play a more powerful device through them, like with my computer they totally rock! However, they should deliver 75 watts of power, no matter what source the input is, so I am extremely disappointed in this purchase."
3,That's it?,"These speakers worked well for the price but I haven't had them a year yet and the left one has blown and sounds terrible. Yes I like loud music but I didn't think I cranked them high enough to blow them. Oh well I got what I paid for, if you want something that sounds good at low levels these are good."
2,"Pretty sweet deal, for about 30 days","I bought these speakers about 2 months ago and they were great! After using them for literally one month, a hum started and hasn't stopped. I'm currently in the process of trying to get my money back. Unfortunately the amazon return policy only gave me 30 days so I am now trying to go through Coby. Which is proving more difficult than I'd hoped as they would like to send me a new set (shipping on me, of course).I bought these speakers because they were cheap and I wanted to see if a 2.1 laptop speaker set was something I would use. Turns out it's turned into something I can't live without lol. So, I can't go buy a new set of something better because I already have these and Im not a wasteful guy. And these are no longer the cheap speaker set I had signed up for (after paying another $15 to ship the new one out, and this broken one back).I don't recommend these speakers.. well worth the extra $20 bucks to get a brand that's not Coby."
3,"good speakers, when sub is turned on",these speakers are defiantly worth the price you pay. sounds good with all types of music although if you play the music with the sub woofer on low the music sounds the shit. otherwise music sounds fine. overall three stars in my opinion.
1,weak,"after reading all of the reviews i was very excited, but the speakers were not loud at all. very underwhelmed by product, ended up returning speakers."
4,good system,"this system is good... it had me thinking it was raining outside, but it was just water falling in the movie i was watching. it has a high sound, never had it up to max, just about half way is loud enough for me... though i did have the sound up to about 2/3rds max and... WOW, LOUDit'll take some tweaking to get your sound volume and your bass to your own liking, but it's no biggie, i did it in about 5 minuets and i'm picky with how much bass is used. this system only has 1 downfall... the power button and volume/bass control are on the back of the sub, which you have to place on the ground... so if i want to adjust the volume or bass control i have to get on my hands and knees and crawl under my desk to turn it up/downwhat i suggest to avoid doing that is to set it a little bit higher than the volume you want and then use your computer's master volume to turn it up and down, this way there's little-to-no no crawling :)"
3,First Unit defective - Overall Decent Product,"The product arrived quickly. Everyting looked to be in good condition. However, the left side audio output from the unit was not working (Booo COBY). So we could only play the sub and one satelitte speaker. Amazon is sending a replacement(Yay Amazon!).I am a recording engineer so I work with 24bit High resolution studio monitors (speakers) down to the dollar store headphones. I can tell from playing it thus far that it wlll definately suit my needs (speaker set for bedroom pc). Frequency response seems smooth and balanced. However, I will warn that I suggest using custom EQ settings from your device in order to acheive optimal results.ACS"
4,Nice sound for the price!,"Pretty good power level for the price point. Clear audio. Volume cord and speaker wires could be longer, limits how you set up. For less than twenty-eight shipped I am very happy with the power, clarity, and value. Used On home pc."
2,Meh,"The two speakers that come with it are decent. The base was broken when it came, barely made a sound. Will calling Colby customer service"
2,Died after 6 months!,"My dad got this as a Christmas present from work and promptly gave it to me. I loved that it was easy to plug in my iPod and iPhone even with thick cases on them. Did well with filling my first floor full of music. Then one day it got staticy and then next day didn't even turn on. Even if it's cheap, I don't want to be replacing my mp3 players twice a year!"
5,Nice little set,I love this system. It is plenty loud enough for my garage. Sound and bass are great. I can play my mp3 player and do whatever.
4,great speakers,I've had them for about six months now and they still have great sound quality.I would recommend these speakers to anyone.
1,system died after 6 months,"sound was pretty darn good, was using it at work, to play my ipod, and enjoying the hell out of it.but, tragically the system died after 6 months of use. I think it was the amp or power supply, but-Woe is me, it's out of warranty. :-(so I'm looking around Amazon for a replacement,don't know if I ever will buy another product from Coby."
4,nice deal,"I bought this primarily for use with my mp3 player for my front porch. But I have used these speakers for my mp3 player, computer and TV just py plugging in to a power outlet and the headphone jack. They sound terrific on all three. I did have to adjust the equalizer setting on my laptop computer to achieve good sound. The equalizer setting I had on the MP3 player for my car worked just fine. The old analog TV has no equalizer but the sound was very good. I had been looking for a docking station speaker system for the mp3 but chose this instead. I am well pleased. A good value."
4,good for the price,"i bought these speakers for a short event and then just expect to never use them again because of how bad the quality would be. but after i started playing them they are quailty speakers. im not saying their comparable to ""Bose"" or ""Kliphs"" but they will give you the best bang for your buck. to start off the subwoofer is my favorite part about this whole system. you can easily shake a 15x15 room with it. the satilite speakers that come with it are alright but once you turn it up past a certain degree it gets very distorted. thats all there is to say about these speakers. i would still recomend them to my friend and to you. at $30.00 it would be hard to find better speakers!!!"
4,coby 2.1 speakers,"The subwoofer blew out after a few weeks (constant LOUD/annoying buzzing sound when left on). They sent a replacement, hope it doesn't also break."
5,Fantastic deal!,"If you're thinking about adding sound to your computer workstation or need an iPod /MP3 player for the patio, look no further! You won't believe the sound quality for the price."
3,Worked good until now...,"I had this speaker system for a few years now. It sounds pretty good with my laptop and television. I don't like that I have to turn on the switch in the back of the subwoofer to turn it on and do it every time I want to use it. In addition, the cord that connects the system to whatever you are using is sometimes not long enough.Now there is no sound coming from the right audio output in the subwoofer. When I plug one of the satellite speakers in the right audio output, no sound. When I plug it into the left one, it works fine. So I can only use one speaker now.I tried contacting technical support three times through email. I never got a reply back."
5,Pats fan 4 life!,"Sweet flag, was looking for the old logo. quality is ok, not as good as the double sided stitched flags, but the color is good, its only 1 sided, good price on Amazon, the best I could find with the old logo and perfect for flying in the face of my neighbors in San Diego! lol"
2,pats banner,"expected a nylon, got a thin cheap plastic and colors not completely dry. Took it out of the package to unfold it and my fingers were blue!"
4,Great Gift Idea,I got this for my mom for Christmas. She is a huge fan of the old Patriots logo and absolutly loved it.
2,try at your own risk - keep on hand just in case,"although it does have eight (8) different female leads, this product did not do the job for me and sits in the ""everything"" drawer: i needed it to use in place of the adapter i lost for the portable CD player - although one female lead DID fit...it did not power the device. (granted, it does NOT promise to power EVERY device...but you would think that with that many different sizes, well,...)"
4,Works great a little big,"It works great but it is a little thick ...Meaning it is hard to use on some outlets with a closing cover,which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. With that said it works great. It is a great price too for so many options. Radio shack wanted twice as much for just one option.No more looking for the proper adapter!"
1,It would be nice,if the product description would tell you how many amps it outputs and other such useful info. Electronics can easily be damaged if you put more juice into them than they can handle.
4,Excellent New Testament Version,"I was thrilled to find this New Testament after searching for quite a while. It was recommended by my Bible teacher, Joyce Meyer, and has proved to be very helpful."
4,Simple. practical advice for healing,"Just as a wise person won't fight fire with fire, one is ill-advised to fight hatred with hatred - whether it's sexism, racism, or any other -ism. Love IS the universal solvent, which Jampolsky proves again and again in this book, with stories and principles, examples and suggestions. Rather than doing battle with our demons, we're enouraged to RELEASE them. This book embodies the best of a Judeo-Christian outlook without being preachy or religious."
2,What were the reviewers thinking?,"I bought this because of the great reviews and because I too remember the band's two hit songs. Now, having received and listened to the CD, I wonder how any reasonable person could rate this as a five star effort.The Electric Prunes suffer from the same disease which claimed so many of their contemporaries ...mediocrity.Does anyone else remember how many albums were sold from 64 - 66 that had only one or two good songs? I don't remember either, but I do remember there were far too many ... add this one to the pile."
4,VERRY GOOD !!!!!,THIS ALBUM IS A CLASSIC.I HAD TO MUCH TO DREAM LAST NIGHTIS GREAT AND GET ME O THE WORLD ON TIME IS TO.IF YOU LIKEPSYCHEDELIC MUSIC I WOULD GET IT
3,"Un tanto disparejo, pero cuando aciertan...","Aunque I had too much too dream (last night) es lejos lo más conocido y lo mejor de este disco, hay otros temas que destacan como Bangles, Are you lovin' me more (que suena como Floyd en Piper), la endemoniada Sold to the highest bidder y sus aires rusos y Get me to the world on time, todas excelentes ejemplos de un sonido a medio camino entre la sicodelia y el garaje. No es un trabajo parejo, se podría dividir en tres, un tercio excelente, uno bueno y otro bastante mediocre. Si bien los Electric Prunes apenas componen, el trabajo instrumental es sólido, en especial la guitarra y hay bastantes ideas dando vueltas y que desarrollarán en sus próximos intentos."
1,Don't waste your money...,This book is one big advertisement for Imediafax.com. All the resources listed in the back of the book lead to their website and all the examples of press releases in the book are ones they've created. The book implies you need to use their company to get good publicity. It's gratuitous and annoying. Bulletproof News Releases by Kay Borden is much more helpful.
2,Standard refills taste blah!,"Get a premium refill. The ""booster"" gives the beer a phony after-taste. I went to another site to get Belgian imports. They are much better and produce more beer with 8% alc!!!"
4,Beer was good - but expensive,"This was a gift for my husband and he was not sure about it. It was a lot of work and it did take a while before the beer was ready to drink which was expected. He did like the beer a lot but the cost was not a whole lot better when factoring in the time and effort (including the clean-up). He has yet to make the second batch. Still if this is something you enjoy doing, the flavor was quite good."
1,Worst headphones I've ever owned.,"A hi-fi salesman tricked me into buying these by playing a recording of a woman singing - I thought gee, that sounds alright. They were a bit expensive but I thought: that's ok, it's from Sennheiser who make the best headphones in the world, so I can't go wrong, can I? Ha ha, as soon as I got it home and started playing my favourite classical and pop music, it sounded like music coming from a phone booth. These were cheap-feeling, plastic headphones with a terrible sound. I tried selling them on our staff forum at work and only one person tried them and returned them. I couldn't even give them away. Eventually they went in the bin - shame about the expense!"
3,Good headphones... if you have an extra amp.,"The HD500s are incredibly comfortable, with a great depth of sound to them. I can see them being really great headphones, but only if you really know what you're getting.Firstly, the open backs really rule out alot of situations for me, as everyone else can hear exactly what you're listening to, which isn't ideal at all.Secondly, these are pretty crap if you're using them for anything else other than to listen to music that's amped in some way. Like mentioned in the description, using these for stereos etc is pointless, as the sound seems 'distant' in your ear.If you happen to be a huge fan of ambient music however, such as Zero 7, lemon jelly and so on, then these headphones are superb with their bass response, however, otherwise, I'd stick to another pair."
3,"Very Comfortable, Average Sounds","These phones are extremely comfortable, I love Sennheisers new ""bionetic"" design. However, these headphones are not what I would excpect for [the price]. The only genre I was comfortable listening to on them was Rock, and beyond that I felt the sounds was muddled and not very open. They have a somewhat strange ""semi-open aire"" design which is not standard. If you can afford them the Sennheiser HD-600's...are outstanding; however, for something nearer this price range, and usability I highly recomend the Grado SR-60's...They are less expensive, and sound much better."
2,"Comfortable, but sound is disappointing","I bought them and later had to return.These headphone are comfortable to wear and have all the usual Sennheiser stuff - like one ear detachable cord, easily replaceable parts and so on. They also represent low frequencies quite well, and are not easy to overload. But they TOTALLY suppress high frequencies. Some people believe that they just show you the true, uncolored sound. I think this is a mistake. You can compare the sound with the best headphons out there (like HD580) - and hear the difference. Of course you can use an equalizer to correct this problem - but hay, this is a Sennheiser, it's supposed to sound perfectly without ajustments.By the way, HD570 have the opposite problem - they emphasize high frequences too much - which many people noticed and it's true."
5,"Comfort, Quality, Price, you can't beat this","It's a risk buying headphones over the internet because you can't hear the sound or feel the comfort. I had a less than satisfying experence with a set of Aiwa headphones. After reading of few customer reviews I took a chance on the Sennheiser Hd500. These are easily the best mid priced headphones I've tried. For the average listener who likes to crank it up now and then this is what you want. I can't possibly imagine what you get by spending more money. The sound is rich and clear while being very light and comfortable. These make the ""old Standard"" Koss pro AA pale in comparison."
2,Petal meddle,2 1/2Mood metal struggles against mediocrity and often succeeds thanks to the emotional override but there is still nothing much that sticks out beyond a certain level of competence and a few eerily channeled Floyd covers. Petal mettle
4,History of the Olive,Nice history of the olive. Like the fact that the author spend time developing this book. For the olive oil lovers in all of us. Extra Virgin no doubt.
4,Frio cooling wallet,"We have a type 1 diabetic in our family, and we will be flying for our vacation this year. We are concerned about our insulin staying cool. We have heard from friends that the frio products will keep our insulin cool enough(but not cold like a fridge) for the trip. And more convenient than a traditional cooler! We tested the product when it first arrived in the mail, and it seemed to work just fine. Although our unopened insulin that we carry in the frio will need to be discarded after 28 days from the first day of our trip, it is a small price to pay for the convenience!"
5,Great Reading from the Fringe...,Rowe has brought together an excellent collection from the fringes. This book is entertaining and a great starting point for people interested in the idiosyncratic world of e-zines.
3,pretty good product.,It's supposed to help with fatty acid oxidation so the effects are super visible. But it has been scientifically prove to work.
1,DEAD MOVIE,"Shame on talented actors like Maura Tierney and Jerry Orbach for their involvement in this laughably bad mystery movie. Uninspired direction with a trite and convoluted script combine with terrible acting to make a movie that has little to recommend it. ""Star""/co-writer John Romo is one of the worst leading men to come around the bend in some time, and this is his only film, and I can see why. He plays a private investigator who finds himself looking into the murders of several lingerie models whose underwear was designed by Tierney, who also works in a local factory run by Orbach. Dennis Christopher shows up as a seedy illegal alien investigator; and June Lockhart and Lyle Waggoner lend their names to supporting roles as Tierney's estranged parents. The movie professes to make some statement on the poor treatment of immigrants but it's so shoddily included, it makes no statement at all.Little heard of movie; I can see why!"
1,Reliable product,Product is of high quality construction. I have other products in this line. They have held up for over 8 years and still look like new. This new towl bar fits right in.
1,Spirit of St. Louis Model Kite,"Do to the brief description of the kite, I assumed there would be no problems assembling it, and looked forward to it's construction. However upon opening the box, I found the Kite Kit was nothing but a bundle of sticks, and none are cut to length. You will need a large flat building board surface to spread out the plans, to build it on. I am skilled in construction of Radio controlled model airplanes, and I hav'nt seen a kit like this in many years. The level of construction skill needed for assembly of this model is known as ""Advanced"". These days, there are many model airplane kits that are known as Quick-built, or a.r.f. (almost ready to fly). This kite kit will require advanced construction skills to complete. I've shelved mine for a later date. I have many less complicated kits I need to complete.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003L8LV/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
4,ZOMBIE ZOO,This game is easy to control and has plenty of zombies to kill. overall i'd rate this about a 7 on the scale of 1-10
3,Not the right game for wii,"Ok I had a wii and no other platform but wanted a game aside from the party games that are fun with wii. I bought this based on the reviews. I have played it all of the way through and while entertaining it just wasnt that great when I knew that the ps3 and xbox could blow it out of the water in terms of graphics, and game play. The whole time I played it I just kept thinking how much better it could be. There are things that the wii is great for. This isnt one of them and should have been left to the x-box and ps3."
2,Outdated Graphics. Poor Control options.,This game doesn't play well on the Wii system. Lots of Graphic glitches.I'm sure there are 1st person shooters out there.
3,Eh,"Everyone has told me that I have to play the Resident Evil games. I'm one who likes to start a game series from the beginning. Well, RE 4 was the closest I could get. I'm not very impressed. I played the Wii version, which was very interactive and my interest held through the entire plot. I think I was hoping to feel what the hype is all about. I just didn't. Reminded me of Deadly Premonition. I have a feeling DP took some cues from the RE series. RE 4 is an ok game, but I'm not sure if I'll play any others. Maybe if I'm just that bored..."
5,amazing game,"I bought this game for the PS2 a while ago and I threw the game away after trying to master the controls for 1 hour. It was frustrating, I just could not aim an shoot and it sucked.I bought the game for the Wii hoping the control scheme would make a difference and it did. The wiimote and the nunchuck are so intuitive and make the game play a whole lot of fun than with the traditional game controller. The game is amazing. The cutscenes are brilliant. The graphics are beautiful, story is super cool and it has lots of extras. I never got stuck in any of the levels and this is the best game I've played. It took me about 24 hours to finish the game and about 6 hours to finish the mini game (which is unlocked after you finish the main game)So if you have a Wii, buy this game *now*. There is no reason to wait."
3,AMAZON missinformation,"The reason i bought this game was because i wanted to try my new Perfect Shot for Wii by Nyko. Amazon offers the game as a bundle with the Perfect Shot so i assumed that they are compatible.To my great disappointment I discovered, on Christmas day, that this game is not AT ALL compatible with the Perfect Shot. The firing key configuration that requires to press the B and A keys together do not allow the use of anything other than the Wiimot.So, I hope AMAZON will stop offering the game and the Perfect Shot as a bundle to avoid having other people confused and angry.For the moment i have nothing to say about the game which looks like a good one but not what i wanted."
5,great game,Great Game!! Would recommend to buy this game if an adult has some volence and bad words not for young children. Very Cool!
5,Great game,I have always had a trouble getting interested in Resident Evil games and quite honestly I had 4 on the Gamecube for a time and could not enjoy it. Fast forward a few years and I pick up the Wii Edition and I got to say it is simply amazing. The new controls are a perfect fix for the system and the game works really well.Aiming is pretty much ten times better with the Wii Mote. Graphically it looks on par with what the Gamecube version was. The story and cutscenes are simply amazing and not only well animated but well detailed. You can also upgrade your guns and mix herbs to increase your health. The best part is taking a grenade and chucking it at a bunch of your enemies and watching them explode. The game is gory and is simply a blast. I have to say this game is a must own if you like Resident Evil or games in general that have a strong story.
5,Unbelievable game for the price!,"If you have not already played this game on the PS2 of Cube, buy it now if you like action or fps games. It is my favorite game of all time. I've beaten it about 7 times. I have it for both Wii and Cube. Unlike other resident evils (all of which I have played besides the outbreak series), this game is actually quite long. Your first time through may take anywhere from 16-24 hours to beat. Usually the other resident evils take about 7-10 hours for first try. Gameplay is what makes this game special. you can play it over and over again. Also, rewards for beating it make the replay value very high. Don't miss out on this awesome game. Catch up on the story for resident evil 5. If you can get it for under $35 brand new, it's a no brainer!"
5,DANG,The best single player game (if you like a often scare and a bit of discust and gore) but there is a small amount of gore compared to gears of war. im getting xbox 360 so i can buy resident evil 5 in october or when ever it comes out.
2,NEEDS TO COME WITH THE GUN,"Only played the game for 30 min before I gave up..... This game should come with the gun you need to play the game. It's like playing ""Guitar Hero"" with no guitar."
3,Hard on the Eyes,"This was a gift for my husband, who has played computer games our entire 19 years of married life. This is the first Wii game I bought him that was ""like"" the computer games he plays. He found it extremely difficult to play - he said it was very difficult on his eyes. We have a 52"" Samsung 1080p television - excellent visual quality - so it's not the television. It's definitely the Wii aspect - he said it actually makes him nauseous - and this from a man that loves roller coasters."
3,Fun Zombie Killin'!,"Great game, not a big fan of how they had the Wii controlls set up. It doesn't work with the gun. Great game though, lots of fun!"
5,A Legendary Cult Classic that you'll show your kids in the future...,"This game is awesome! The Wii controls work WONDERFULLY!5/5 story5/5 suspense5/5 action5/5 OMGOMGOMGCRAPCRAPWHATDOIDO!!?!!!4/5 graphics.Overall, this game is worth every penny!Also includes bonus material after beating the game!Also: check out Resident Evil 6 on Youtube when you get the chance!"
4,Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition,"Specially for Resident fans, the best game of the saga. very fun, long, and had nice graphics"
2,Really?,"The Wii can be great fun with the unique controls, but is that enough to rave about this 1st person shooter?I loved the movies but the plot here was lame. This is almost a 3D version of Hunt the Wumpus.Boring."
2,Not zapper compatible,"This game was excellent when it originally came out on the Gamecube. I loved it. It is still very good on the Wii.My problem is this; Why re-release a game, soley because of the Wii's wireless aiming capabilities (well not solely, I'm sure it was the money too), and then completely ignor the fact that the WiiMote has a trigger on the bottom of it. This game could be so much better, if the option for changing your controls existed, or if the re-designers just used some common sense (duh, pull trigger to shoot, not pull trigger to aim). Had they just done that, the game would be worth playing again.If you've already played it on the GC, it isn't worth another go. Nothing was changed for the better.If you haven't played it, I'd suggest it, but I'd get the GC version, or just connect a classic controller to your WiiMote to play it with some original controls."
2,ok I guess,"Not such a fun game. Awful graphics, everything blends together. Boring in general. Traded it in to amazon after playing it for an hour."
4,Warning to Wii players with gun accessory,"Resident Evil 4 is one of the most engrossing games since Half Life 2. I enjoyed playing this game so much on my Game Cube, I bought it again to play on my Wii. The idea of pointing a gun at the screen and firing away at the vampire zombies (or whatever the heck those things are) would've kept me happy and unproductive for the rest of my life. Problem was, the game developers forgot to add the option to switch button controls. In other words, this game is useless with any of the Wii gun accessories, thanks to the ""A"" or Fire button being situated on the top of the wiimote. Meaning if you want to actually shoot at the zombie/vampire thingies, you don't pull the trigger... you click the button along the top of the barrel. ???? A serious bummer and a waste of a great opportunity to have one of the best games ever enhanced even more by the Wii."
5,this game was a gift.,This game went to my friend for her kids and they love it especially her 14 year old girl. They really like playing it.
3,Great game but didn't hold interest.,This is a wel designed game but it did not hold interest long which is odd. Great pricing though!
5,Fantastic and Scary!,"I (we) have been using this game a few hours per day for over 3 months and it is AMAZING! Once in, it feels as if you're really IN the game. Very creepy and scary - I get goosebumps using this game and have often jumped out of my skin by a creature lurking behind a corner or hidden room.We finally reached the end after what seemed to be hundreds of ""virtual miles"" of exploration. And now we're in the bonus sections which are not cummulatively as long as the original, but are a unexpected, tasty cherry on top of a massively delicious sundae.Well, well worth the price."
5,A personal favorite,"A load of fun. Has supplanted Guitar Hero World Tour in my heart.Beware the gun that they try to bundle with the game- It doesn't work with RE4, since you fire with your A (thumb) button.Speaking of recommendations, avoid No More Heroes. This game is 10 times more fun."
3,Initial thoughts...,"I'm definitely more used to Xbox/PS controls, so one of the initial problems I'm having is not being able to strafe. One of my cousins has this game, and I'd watched him play and thought it looked amazing. Sadly, I generally am pretty sucky with most video games, so all learning curves are a bit tough - this one is more of a brick wall than Dead Rising, which as far as I'm aware is -really- saying something. I think this'll be a fun game if I ever get past the initial village fight. It's just very frustrating how little time one has to learn, and no one else in my house is into Wii, so I'm kind of stuck with the big bad gamers I live with not really feeling inclined to step in and help me through this crazy beginning. Once I DO get the hang of it I think it'll be a lot of fun!"
4,"Once again, too advanced.",This game as with others Papaw has purchased for his Grandson is too advanced. Mamaw can't even play it. I think it's a great game just in the wrong hands.
2,User Error,"There is nothing wrong with this game. I think it would be great if I was an action gamer person but this game let me know I'm not. I dont know how to move and shot at the same time. I keep killing my character in the first few minutes of the game and I can't find the ""items"" that are supposed to help. The graphics are great, the game is engaging. My problem is ""user error"". I'm sticking with Mario Kart."
4,Wii gestures enhances the game,I enjoyed playing RE4 with the gestures more than playing on a PS. The Wii controller gestures make the game feel more realistic.
4,"Resident Evil 4, Still working on it.",I am really enjoying this game. I have had to get online a couple of times to find cheats but am thinking that anyone who has a little more experience with video games would not have to do so. It is a different game than I usually purchase but am thinking it is great fun and shooting zombies is getting to be great therapy.
2,Too scary,"My husband bought this game for himself, but is too scared to play it alone!! I've watched as he plays and it really doesn't look fun at all. He just walks around killing the same zombies over and over. I also hate having a game in the house my children can't be exposed to. I found the game booklet in with my 4 year old daughter's books the other night... Ugh."
2,Capcom pulled a fast one!,"I was very dissapointed with the Wii version of this game. While the control scheme has definitely enhanced the gameplay experience, the game looks terrible on an HDTV. Many gaming websites are claiming that RE4 supports native widescreen. This is not true at all!! Capcom apparently decided to pull a fast one by ""zooming"" in on the original GameCube port and upscaling the image, thus removing the black bars! It looks absolutely terrible. The game looks better if I first convert my Wii widescreen settings to 4:3 and then using my TV's zoom feature. I felt Capcom pulled a fast one on the consumer and as a result I feel ripped off."
2,can't get into it,"I found the controls on this ridiculously hard to learn and frustrating. Also, the game is very dark, and the view in front of you is so narrow that it's hard to find your way around or even get a sense of what's around you. I play for like 5-10 minutes, get mad and frustrated and turn if off. But that's just me..."
2,Bad game for the wii's controllers,I like the wii and think its motion sensing controllers work great for some games. When i played this game on the wii however the controller and nunchuck did not seem right at all. I don't think the wii's controllers work well on first person shooters.
4,Pretty graphic,"The game is a lot of fun but is definitely intended for an older player. The game is rated M for violence, gore and language, although I haven't come across the language yet. But the gore is definitely another story. And don't shoot the merchants, they die."
2,not great,"biggest gripe is the controls. hard to control, feels akward, negatively affects gameplay. also, your character is often in the way, there were many times when i would try to shoot at something and couldn't hit it, or couldn't hit it accurately, because my character was in the way. and since ammo is at a rediculous premium this can really be a pain.overall, i'd say your money would be better spent elsewhere on a different game."
4,en muy buen estado,"compre este producto usado y lo recibí en muy buen estado, dentro del periodo de tiempo ofrecido,muchas gracias estoy complacida"
5,Great Game! With Great Bouns Games!,"This game is awesome! Especially for the price! Once you beat the game there are bonus games that are really fun. The Seperate Ways bonus game is about 5 hours! And you can replay all the games over and over gaining skill levels unlocking caracters and weapon. The graphics are good, the controls are easy to master. Buy it, you won't regret it!"
4,Great,"Great game. Great characters, intriguing story, creepy-like atmosphere. Great. Not perfect, no game is completely perfect, but great. I highly recommend this. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
5,A Great Game,A very great game I would recommend anyone to get this game. One of the best games you can play on wii if not the best I have played. You can't go wrong with this game
3,Nice Game,"The game was very intense for me at times, but it was difficult for me to keep playing. It took me a while to get my hands on it and play again, eventually I passed the game. It has some entertaining parts though."
5,OUTSTANDING.,"This book, *Ambassador Strikes,* has it all. It met my number one ""requirement"" in that is is extremely well written, but the story also has a page-turning quality that makes this quick read hard to put down.The author takes us from the hopping, neon world of Tokyo to the pastoral setting of a Wisconsin lake, to the thriving suburbs of Chicago, to Georgetown (where I could see the streets and tall, brick homes on the Potomac) to the White House and back to Tokyo again, as the likeable main character, Nick Conboy, tries to solve the mystery of Ambassador Strikes' murder.This is a great summer read. A movie played in my head as I eagerly turned the pages and I imagined someone like Ben Afflick, or even Kevin Costner or Harrison Ford playing the lead.I highly recommend this book."
2,"Old-Type, Standard Drama","Ninotchka felt like a 1930's movie. Maybe thats because it was turned into one. Or perhaps the play came after the Garbo film. I don't know.The story is about the contentious and lovely relationship between Ninotchka, a young Russian woman sent to Paris to reacquire Rembrandt paintings once in the possession of the Soviet Union. Her counterpart is Leon, a Parisian lawyer representing a former Russian princess who took the paintings with her when she fled Bolshevik Russia. Ninotchka and Leon hit it off, despite international intrigue and the threat of lost love or life. Three Russians originally sent to negotiate with Leon provide the clownish relief, as they contrast stark Communist demands on existence with the joy of hedonistic heavy Paris.Definitely a dated play, standard in it's structure, theatrical conceits and conclusion."
1,very unhappy,"After getting the teakettle in January, I had to stop using it by June. The kettle was leaking water all over the kitchen counter and at time it would not turn off by itself. Delongi sent me a new kettle to replace the one that was broke but it was a model only worth $80.00. When I ask about the $50.00 difference in price of the two teakettles I was told they covered their warranty and I'm out of the $50.00. I won't be buying anymore of Delongi products!"
1,Leaks like crazy,"Like the other reviewers were saying, the kettle leaks all over the counter. It is amazing that it hasn't shorted out the fuse or shocked anyone.After a crappy heater and another crappy water kettle, I'l stay away from DeLonghi."
4,Sharpay costume,"My daughter bought this costume (along with a matching wig) for a birthday party where one of the games involved High School Musical Karaoke performances. The girls all tried on the costume and performed different songs - - no rips, no tears after lots of passing around; the dress is realy pretty and glitzy but not flimsy at all. They had a great time with this dress up outfit."
4,Noelle Adam: Aladdin's girlfriend,"Lovely Frech ballerina-actress Noelle Adam performs in bare feet a very risque belly dance to obtain money for passage on a caravan. Later as a prisoner of the evil Grand Visir she hangs naked by her tied wrists in a dungeon where her footsies are about to be sizzled with drops of acid until resued by friends. Toward the end of the film Aladdin uses his last wish to save our beautiful heroine who has again been captured, stripped,and suffers torture by being suspended over a slow fire with the heat rising to the soles of her feet. While no nudity is shown onscreen either time, there are excellant closeup shots of Miss Adam's stretched underarms and luscious toes that point and wriggle in a near orgasmic fashion."
4,Handy,"I bought this as a spare to travel with and to sync at home. I leave my other cable at work.Pro:-Standard USB plug so it doesn't crowd out other plugs in our computer or our 4-port hub-Built in ""sync"" button on the end that attaches to the Palm is handy-Firm connection to the palm-Good cable lengthCon:-Black connector hard to see, would like a gray or white option-No cover for the palm connection end, be wary of damaging the exposed pinsBottom line: recommended."
1,last as long as the warrenty,"I bought this tv Aug.1,2000; on Aug.5,2002, it quite working. The warrenty had expired. The repair cost are TWO HUNDRED, PLUS PARTS. The tv was very good when it worked, but for six hundred dollars, it should last more than two years. Buyer Beware."
5,Worked good for me,Pad sticks and is sticky... I put one piece on crooked and was able to peel it and re-stick it without issue.
4,Satisfied,My son ordered this game online and it arrived in a timely manner in good condition. He has wasted no time in playing it repeatedly!
3,"Good, but...","So if you are a fan of The Specials, you will most likely already have the bulk of the tracks included here - many of the songs appear multiple times with little difference between the versions, and the bonus tracks do little to capture the ""sound"" of the Specials.In addition, only the first disc really addresses the ""Specials"" - discs 2 and 3 are mostly devoted to the ""Special AKA"" - a BIG difference for some folks.Don't get me wrong, it really is a good set, especially if you don't already own their original releases, but based on the way the record company is trying to steal your money on this set ($50.00 for 3 discs of old material???), it's probably better - and possibly cheaper - just to find the original releases."
4,Very Comfortable and Great Sound!,"I've owned these for quite a few years. They are so comfortable you barely know they are there. When I bought them, I didn't know about the difference between open and closed, or rather, I didn't know open existed as every pair i had ever seen was the closed type. Anyway, my only gripe is that they are open and let the world hear what you are listening to, which isn't their fault -- they are intended to do just that!For the sound, I usually like things a bit brighter but with a nice, clean bass. I also like to avoid using an EQ. I'm not an audiophile, but I think these sound very good.One great feature is the replaceable cable. Eventually your cable will break so I don't understand why all headphones don't have replaceable cables (except for the really high end ones -- another junction probably reduces the quality by some unknowable amount...)"
3,"Very comfortable, but mediocre sound","After breaking these in these headphones still did not sound very good at all. They are, however, very comfortable, but feel like they would fly off my head at the slightest movement. Going back to the sound, in general most of it is pretty clear, but the bass gets distorted, while the mids are muddy and the highs are grainy. It does sound a little better with some acoustic music, but not by a whole lot. Definitely not one of the better offerings by Sennheiser. I give it a 3 mostly for its comfort level, but considering its price, I would say a 1 or 2 for its sound quality."
2,Disappointing,"I bought a similar pair 3 years ago from Sennheiser, 4xx?Expression Line and I loved them. Best headphones I ever had! Sound is just awesome. Unfortunately I've abused them so I bought these and wow what a difference. No where near as good as the previous ones I had. Quite a bummer. I'm taking them back to and will try the 495's. Hope they're better."
1,Tinny and Scratchy,"I really dislike these headphones... They are very tinny and scratchy. Also, they are very tight and hurt my ears - and I have a tiny head (I can wear child size hats), so I can't imagine how tight they must be on a person with a big head! I wish I never bought them."
3,Too much bass,"Yes, these are very comfortable headphones. And, yes, they're pretty good. But Sennheiser has really pumped up the bass on these. If you love bass, you'll love these headphones. But the bass in unnaturally strong, and headphones or speakers should always emphasize accuracy and not over emphasize one end of the sound spectrum."
2,"Good Sound, Bad Bass","As an avid headphone collector, I haven't really come to trust Sennheiser as a company. These phones don't usually have bad sound, in fact the treble is wonderful. But every time I put a disc or cassette on, it sounds like I've pumped up the bass to the maximum level. I really hate this, because if I try to turn the bass down, it keeps up with the same thumping in the background. These headphones aren't good for much except for solo bass records."
5,Great sound quality,"This is the best headphone I have ever used. The quality ofsound is terrific. I love all types of music, using these headphonesI can here the all the instruments and the words that are being sung. I am very happy with my choice. Thank you END"
3,Needs a pic,because of lack of picture i accidently purchased the wrong item.. worked out fine in the end
1,Still Waiting,"I have still not received this book, even though I have purchased it about 5 weeks ago. So, the company that this book is coming from is not very reliable. As for the book itself, I really can't review it, since I don't have it."
2,eh,"I used this book in my ECON 201 class (Principles of Microeconomics class) at my university and I think it is extremely wordy. They elaborated too much on easy concepts, thus making it impossible to understand. There is no answer key to the questions in the book. If you can find another book then do so, because I felt that reading online was a lot better than reading this book."
5,Excellent Purchase,"Shipper sent it out fast, the book was brand new even though it was listed as used. Definitely would work with this seller again"
1,Economics book review,"the product never got shippe, the seller said that something came up (a family matter i suppose). I really did need this textbook for school so i was greatly disappointed when the seller told me that he would cancel the trade we made."
4,Moving and thoughtful,"Burgess is best known for fiction--Clockwork Orange--but his memoirs and his nonfiction were extraordinary. Read these, as well as his tribute to James Joyce, Re Joyce, and your life will be enhanced. Honest."
4,great novel,"I thought the book was hard to follow at first, but it was a great novel. I like the kind of novels that you dont get at first , then when the novel comes to an end, it all comes into place and ends perfectly."
5,Summer Gone,"I picked this because the cover intrigued me! (I don't usually do that!) I was captivated throughout the entire novel. The author's style was unique and refreshing. I could not wait for the surprising conclusion, but wished for more once I reached it!"
2,Summer Gone? Or Summer Ahead? I'm Confused,"I too found the author's technique very confusing. Not just at the outset, but basically throughout. Still not too sure who was the dad and who was the son. Some very nice passages and paternal themes kept me reading right to the end. But for my own quirk of finishing every book I bother to start, probably would have put this volume down about halfway through. The father/son suspense theme sort of reminded me of a weaker attempt at an homage to Joseph Heller's Something Happened. As described by another reviewer the cover art drew me in. I might try this author's other, work(s) if I come across same at a book sale."
5,Definitely for Blue Note lovers,"Enough said.This is for the Blue Note collector.To hear and see both Rudy Van Gelder and Michael Cuscuna is an absolute treat. Also, this CD & DVD package is priced right.G Geder"
2,"Big headache, no effect.","This stuff just plain doesn't work as described past the first few days, and the headaches suck too. Just pay your Dad for a few of his blue pills, and be done with it."
4,interesting character study,"Attention getting. Characters are pretty well filled out. Makes you question the rise and affect of authority. Human behavior is always absorbing, especially the violent side."
4,No Happy Ending,"The story was realistic and gripping. The reality of the story was an expected bitter pill, with a predictable real life ending. It is sad that people get punished for trying to help a bad situation. In some careers, that is the norm."
3,Depressing,The book was an okay read. The only character that I liked was the girlfriend at home that spoke her mind about what military life is like for a wife. Almost everyone in the chain of command is a bully. How can they punish the soldiers for being bullies when that is what comes down the ladder? Very depressing.
2,Marine,"The Lieutenant book is beyond reality. Although it tries to hide the main characters' problems under guise of US Navy requirements, it just becomes an unbelievable tale of gay marines."
2,my opinion,"I had heard about this book written many years ago and perhaps had too high an expectation. I found it plodding, a little dark, and none of the characters likable. Despite many good reviews I wouldn't recommend it. JM"
1,poor quality product,"I have at least 6 of this type of cork screw. This is the poorest design that I've ever seen. The fulcrum, the piece that folds out to expose the corkscrew, is made of soft plastic. After a few uses the end gets damaged and provides a poor point to lever the cork out.This is not even worth the low price.I threw mine away after a few uses."
3,Details Please!,"The product was shipped quickly, packaged nicely to insure it's safe arrival and the item was as described. The only disappointment was that the person that packaged the bottle left sticky finger prints on it, which made it appear used instead of new. The content of the bottle was full though, so it was obvious that it had not been used. For what I paid for it I would have expected the detail of the bottle being clean to not be overlooked."
1,I believe I was sold a tester.,"I believe I was sold a tester perfume. It did not arrive in its original package. In fact it arrived wrapped in paper with no box. The perfume I received does not stay on my skin for even an hour. Perfume testers in stores have added alcohol to the product so that is evaporates quickly. Better to test and sell more perfumes. I know this perfume well. Ive used it since 1994. Its the ONLY perfume I use. I would not reocomend that anyone use frangrance.net. They have never responded to my requests for return label yet and I am fussing at Amazon to help meThis is not a review for Thierry Mugler Parfume, It is a review for Frangrance.net"
1,Not enought,I received this perfume out of its box and this was not explicit in its description.Eu recebi esse perfume fora da caixa original e isso no estava previsto na descrio.
5,Awesome toy!,I have Australian Shepherds and the puppy destroys most plush toys within a day or so. This toy has lasted 3+ months and is very sturdy. It regularly survives tug of war. It is also the pup's favorite toy! Whenever she is excited she grabs her squirrel and wiggles at high speed.
1,Bad Squirrel,"Very cheap materials, flimsy, fell apart almost before my dog shewed on it. Guess no more ""chinese"" pet toys for us!!!"
1,Poor Quality Video,Undersatnd you get what you pay for. The video quality of this DVD is poor. There are a number of scratches on the film and the picture shakes as if a camcorder was used to transfer the movie. If you are a fan of the movie it is better to pay a few bucks more and get a better copy.
4,Panasonic tv from a Video Student's perspective,"I don't own this unit, but I use it day in, day out in school. I'm a films student and use this monitor for my editing. The PanaBlack system is the best for your money, Sony should wimper."
3,"This is good stuff, but the whole album is better","I grew up with Flanders and Swann, and still quote them at almost any opportunity. You may have to listen pretty hard from time to time to get their jokes, but it's well worth the effort. (I especially like it when one of Flanders' quips obviously catches Swann off guard and cracks him up.)Sadly, this appears to be excerpts of Flanders and Swann's ""At the Drop of a Hat"", but it's missing five songs: ""Kokoraki"", ""Too Many Cookers"", ""Vanessa"", ""Tried by the Centre Court"", and ""The Youth of the Heart"".If you can find ""At the Drop of a Hat"", get that instead of this. If you can find the ""Complete Flanders and Swann"", get that!"
5,An old favorite...,"These are all old favorites. I love them! I will read them again and again. I am in my late 30's and have pulled these out of my closet (along with Nancy Drew, Hardy Boys, ...) for my children to read. This is what I want my kids reading and learning about - family values, morals, work ethic and respect for elders and each other. Unfortunately, many kids would be bored by these books in today's society, and that is a shame.I love the mysteries. Some are sillier than others, but what fun reading them as a kid and wishing things like that would happen to you! There is usually something educational to learn and the books are a fun and quick read.Enjoy!!!"
5,still good,"This was one of my favourite books in the series when I was a kid. I recently purchased it for my granddaughter, and found I still enjoy it. Good mystery, as Di Lynch joins the Bobwhites."
5,Great advice for natural remedies,"I found this book for my Mom and wound up taking the advice to heart myself. The book offers excellent information and recommends nutritional supplements for heart health and lowering cholesterol (with my doctor's OK, red yeast rice worked for me, lowering cholesterol from 269 to 173). Great information and quick to read."
1,Freudian Garbage,"To the extent that Freudian and Jungian psychoanalytical theories are mainly based on conjecture I am agog at the premise that modern psychologists are still refering to this subjective garbage for a continual source of both literary topics and insight into the human mind.Freud was a blatant male chauvanist who was obsessed with the phallus and with excrement for goodness sakes. Doesn't anyone else see the inherent silliness of his theories?Let's put Freud, Jung and all the other thinkers out of the ""dark age"" of psychology to rest where they belong."
3,This this my review or just my Inner Dummy speaking...,"Not a bad book. Quite entertaining at times. However, it was repeditive in it attempt to discuss drives/motives and scales for each. I'm not a big psychoanalytical fan, I admire Freud for his work and his attempt to conceptualize problems well before he had instruments to measure/see them. However, I think Carl Jung was right to characterize psychoanalysis as a religion, because it wasn't based on fact. Sneaking Edward Bernays in the end was a bit of a shock (for those you who want an introduction read the 'Father of Spin' obtain at this website)! Its too bad Weiner didn't flesh out more of Bernay's PR battles for the American Fruit Company in Guatemala which costed countless thousand of lives! It appears we write very little of our ""hero's"" transgressions than our enemies. Maybe Mr.Weiner would like to consult with his ID to tell us why?"
1,Reviewing the missing Inner Dummy,"I would be delighted to review this book if it had not been mailed to a four year old address, altho I have purchased numerous items and had them shipped to me at my current, and correct address! This should be a review of communications with Amazon, which are impossible.Russell S Hale"
1,Rachel,"This book is horrible. Mr. Weiner's writing style is hackneyed at best. He drives each point home relentlessly with an astounding number of examples. He uses a couple of gimmicks I found unbearable: First, his painfully detailed recreations of conversations he had with various individuals under the guise of collecting data for his book, but actually serve to showcase the breadth of Mr. Weiner's knowledge, and ability to annoy. Second, the ridiculous chapters in which makes Dr. Freud a character in this madness. This book had about three to ten pages worth of useful information - the rest of the book is all padding and nonsense."
5,Excellent quality for the price!,These water glasses are gorgeous. They are very heavy and the cuts in them make them look like diamonds. Makes a beautiful table when used with my fine cobalt blue and platinum china.
5,A great way to learn advanced mathematics,"While most people would not find anything new in here concerning physics, having studied electricity and magnetism before, the book is still a fascinating look into the mind of a physicist. College math courses will explain the equations and the various mathematical methods used in this book, but they will not explain how those methods are used. A typical mathematician does not think past his equations and takes the results of his calculations without much thought, which is no doubt one of the causes of the depravity one finds in modern physics. Maxwell is not a pedant or a theorist and uses mathematics as a tool, a means to an end rather than an end in itself, and by doing so demonstrates its proper place in physics."
2,LaCross Customer Support,The system has a lot of good features. The weak link in the system is the display. It's difficult to read. My overriding problem is with LaCross's technical support or lack of it. If you buy this product YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN! They will not answer your email or return your calls. Too bad as I would have given it a 4 or 5 star rating with just a little help from LaCross.
2,not enough theme park info,"Other books (Frommer's and Behlinger specifically) are much better guides if the focus of the trip is truly Disney and not Orlando. I bought this book and returned it 24 hours later. Only buy this if you're planning to spend time out of ""The World"". There are better inpark resource guides out there."
5,Great treat for my birds!,"I am owned by five fids (feathered kids), and they really love these Nutriberries as a treat in the afternoons. Sometimes I give them to them whole, and other times I crumble them up. They love them either way."
1,Beating a path from this book.,"I bought this book for a visit to Canada BC last year whilst visiting family. I found it incredibly dull. The content seemed to cater to people in their 70s who wanted to toddle around looking at sights from their car or perhaps the odd bit of wine quaffing at a vineyard. I had hoped for something a bit more ""Lonely Planet"" and interesting. It actually made BC sound boring (which it isn't). I suppose the title slightly misled me. I was expecting to find out about great rock climbing, white water rafting, cycling and mountaineering activities. My wife and i skimmed wearily through its contents and consigned it to the recycling bin. I guess as active late 40 year olds - we were just not target audience is the best i can say about it."
2,If you like disco...,"When I heard that Rampling had some credit in making Voyage into Trance with Oakenfold, I thought cool, let's check out some of his work. So I bought this CD. This is nothing like Voyage into Trance! It has a Latin theme to it but that is not what turned me off. This stuff is border line disco! It is definitely an acquired taste. The combination of mellow beats and soft lyrics definitely doesn't have the energy or the emotions that I would expect from a techno/trance CD. When I think of trance/techno I think of Sasha, Digweed, Oakenfold, and Van Dyk. Anyway this is definitely not my cup of tea. I was bored throughout the discs waiting for something that never came. If I had a choice between Rampling and Morales I would shoot myself before having to listen to this again!"
3,"Well-written, but inaccruate","This is a well-written and entertaining article, but beware--it sometimes plays loose with the facts. For example, it says that ""Yosemite"" means ""some of them are killers"". This is a unsupported myth that was started in 1977 by an untrained Ethnologist in the park. ""Yosemite"" really means ""they are killers"" and it was what the surrounding tribes referred to the people in Yosemite. The Yosemite people called themselves ""Ahwahneechee"" or ""People of Ahwahnee"". Ahwahnee means ""gaping bear's mouth,"" after the gaping shape of the valley walls."
4,It's okay,I've had to sew part of the strap back on because the material isn't very sturdy and one of the rivets came off.I didn't expect much from a bag this cheap.It's okay.Fits all of your things.Just don't overload it or get it snagged on anything.
4,"A little small, but no complaints","This bag is smaller than I imagined but it does not make it any less usable. It feels sturdy and it's made of good material. I can fit my 13"" macbook in there with extra room for a few notebooks. It's definitely not a bad bag and the other reviews are making it seem smaller than it really is."
3,"Liked the bag, not the quality",The handle on my bag is already ripping loose and I have only had it for a few days. Its an easy fix but it was dissapointing to have it rip so fast.
4,Good for it's price.,"This is a cool little messenger bag that you won't really find anywhere. It's pretty small for a messenger bag, but can fit folders and notebooks but don't even try stuffing heavy textbooks in there. Other than that this bag is great makes me feel like a medic!"
5,Works as a limited backpack replacement,"I am only taking a single course this semester. Because of this, I did not want to use my large Swiss Army backpack. I purchased this to carry around what I needed for this class. It quite comfortably carries my course's book (A First Course in Differential Equations 10th Ed. By Zill), which is a 300 page standard size text book, a 5 subject spiral notebook, my TI-84 calculator, and a pencil bag. When I first opened the bag, it looked as though it was too small for my book, but it fit perfectly. I do not think I would trust this bag for heavier textbooks (e.g. my 1000+ page calculus book or my 1200+ page organic chemistry book) but for smaller textbooks, this works well. In regards to its aesthetics, it does have an authentic look to it. The stitching is prominent and adds to the look of the bag. The straps that close the bag have a felt feel to them, and the claps feel solid. Overall, I am very pleased."
2,"Small, flimsy strap","This bag is really small, can hardly fit two books in it. The strap adjuster doesn't stay in place so I had to sew it into place at one position."
3,Bit Disappointed,"I got this for school because I thought it looked really cool, but when it came in, I was a bit disappointed. There are two problems I have, one is that it's so small I can fit only my binder and one textbook, the other is the strap came apart the first day of school. I tied the strap into a knot and that was the end of that problem but otherwise this bag is cool and I plan to use it as long as possible"
3,So so product,"Really rather small, and honestly with no pockets or dividers inside just a sack. Style is nice, and honestly didn't pay much for it so not upset. Still probably something I wouldn't do again unless you are looking to have this just for the style of it. Doesn't have much practical day to day use."
5,Awesome bag!,"I have to say I love the vintage look of the bag and it is perfect for what it is. If I were to get a second bag like it though, I would have it made so I have separate holders inside for medical equipment (IE Stethescope, BP Cuff, Bandages etc) and snaps for easy access to the inside of the bag. Sure it would lose a little authenticity, but it would be more functional."
4,LOVE!,I LOVE THIS BAG! :) it is so cute. It matches everything. It fits everything I need it to! Definitely buy it ;)
3,Good Little Bag,expect a netbook size or standard composition notebook sized bag maybe a little bigger its really nice and looks like it will last for what its worth. The straps look flimsy but don't tug too hard and you'll be set to go Great for me but could have been better support on the straps
4,Great Bag,"Love the bag, it is made well and looks just like the picture so I wasnt disapointed when I got it at all. The only thing that I was not happy with is the fact that it took to long for it to arrive, I purchased it on Dec 11th and it didnt arrive till the 24rth, it took 2 weeks for the bag to come when I had made another purchase and it arrived in 8 days from China. I understand that it was the holidays but 2 weeks for that itwm was way to long. But over all I am happy with the bag."
4,This is a wonderful bag!,"Not only a conversation piece but also carries a lot! Can hold a mid-sized laptop, as well as multiple books. The straps are firm and show no sign of tear after months of use. Great quality!"
5,cute bag,This medic bag was written down on a Christmas List. It will be a gift. It isvery cute and just as described. Very fast delivery. Arrived within a week of ordering.
1,Too small,"This purchase was a big disapoitment for me...the bag is too small, dont be fooled by the picture. I thought the bag would be at least twice the size of the one I got."
