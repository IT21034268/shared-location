3,Very mixed,"There was a lot of good writing in here, and the character of Anna was interesting -- to start. But nothing really happened, the development along the way was pretty sparse, and some of the metaphors began to seem strained after a while. It took me a week to read, which says something; I never picked up this book and found it hard to put it down."
1,Cheap Trick,"Reading chic lit I expect the main character to be a woman who I admire and can identify with. In Jody Gehrman's novel I was disappointed.The main character, Anna Medina, is admirable only in so far as she is contrasted with the other main character, Lucy. The author hates her character Lucy so thoroughly that it brings to mind black face minstrel shows. Throughout the lengthy novel Lucy is assigned every despicable trait imaginable which lends the reader to believe that the best haters of women are women. Not how I want to spend my day off."
2,Definitely not your typical RDI book..,"Just as my title states,this is DEFINITELY not your typical Red Dress Ink book. While most are ""fluff"" in general,this book was more gritty and several times went into much detail about Anna's father's suicide. It is interesting to see Anna's instant attraction to otherwise-romantically-committed Arlan though,probably because he reminds her so much of her father.This book is decent,but not one of my favorites,simply for the fact that it kind of drags along,and goes on about how Anna longs for Arlan but he sticks with Lucy because they are ""comfortable,"" or as Lucy says,""like your favorite socks."" Overall though,this book isn't bad for a debut novel, but I really expected the typical cheerful story I've come to love RDI for,and the usual upbeat feeling I am left with. This one,however,failed to do so for me."
4,the wonders of Valdemar's world,It's a wonderful group view of the Valdemar's wold and it's lands and people. Lackey's world is fertile land where different people shed the seeds of their own insights and they all grow excellent and different produce. How exciting to read what comes of such a collaboration.
4,give it a fair chance,"While I find Kathie Lee quite annoying and intolerable at times this is a nice ""adult"" cd. If it were someone else I think it would be getting better feedback. In this the days of ""artists"" barely out of their teens and music so loud and free of any meaningful lyrics, it is nice to come across a cd that you can put on and either sit and listen or let it blend into the background. It seems alot of Howard Stern fans (of which I am) are really using this forum as way to sting Mrs. Gifford. Granted she can be cloying, but c'mon lighten up!"
1,Born For You Bores,Kathie Lee's album is a poor example of an actress or a showhost who tries to be an artist. Her first three songs bores me to tears and she shows no sincerity and absolutely no soul. She is no Barbara Streisand. Kathie sounds just like a Karaoke singer.I think I should get my money back on this album. I would not recommend anyone to buy this album. This is a waste of time and money.
1,Sorry,"With a vibrato nearly an octave wide, she sounds as if she is nearing senior citizen status. A good voice instructor or enrollment in a good music school would be of great advantage. Save your money."
2,Kathie Lee needs a drink of water,"I just HAD to buy this album because I'm a big ""Regis & Kathie Lee LIVE"" fan. But WAS I EVER SHOCKED to hear this album after all the bragging on TV! 1) Kathie Lee needs a drink of water, mouth noices (like cottonmouth) are audible; 2) every song sounds the same; 3) lots of breathing going on; 4) I forced myself to listen to the whole thing once, but it was really too much; 5) Maybe she can actually sing, but on this album, it sounds like she is PRETENDING to sing. I will stay a fan of hers, but definitely NOT for this album.. She makes a better talk show host. I really did WANT to like this album, so I'm sorry I didn't. Maybe you will feel differently!"
1,"Kathie, Dear, Time to be a stay at home Mom!!",Please leave the singing to those that have a voice. This is embarrassing!
1,Fan No More!,"Wow...What can I say besides ""horrible""? Sorry, Kathie Lee, but yowzers! And to think I was a huge fan...Without getting into details about anything BUT her album, all I can say is I'd almost rather listen to that little whiny Britney Spears girl than Kathie! Ladies and gentlemen, save your money for something more worthwhile!"
2,"Nice girl, Nothing special","Being in the business of finding new talent,I've heard hundreds of singers over the past 20-odd years. Kathy Lee has a nice voice, a nice look,and she has obviously spent a lot of money on this album in terms of arrangers and post-production... but is it ""commercial""? I doubt it. Oh, she may sell dozens of them in the gift shops after her Vegas shows, but is she some blazing new talent that brings a new sound to the scene? Sadly, no. I just hope she hasn't been reading too much of her own publicity. If she is a hard worker, she can parlay her fame as a talk show host into the market for doing special events -- like singing the National Anthem for the World Series... but that's about it for me. Sorry, dear. I really do like you on TV, but give me Aretha, or Faith Hill, or Joni Mitchell. At least their ""soul"" comes from genuine feeling."
3,Good Effort,Kathie Lee gives it her best. The title song Born for You and Only My Pillow Knows (Lyrics by Kathie Lee) do make the CD work. Over all though Kathie Lee struggles to keep the listener's attention. Many songs start to sound the same and the orchestrations seem familiar. Cody and Cassidy sing vocal backgrounds in Child in Me Again. Dolly Parton also helps this CD along with background vocals. Variety is the spice of life and variety is what is possibly lacking here. I would give it a C+ for effort though. Maybe Kathie Lee will write more of her own lyrics for her next CD. She maybe on to something good there.
1,This disc is for KLG fans only. Music fans should avoid it.,"If you like KLG you will like this. If you dislike KLG you can buy this as a comedy/novelty disc and you will like it a lot. And if you can ignore that it is KLG and just evaluate the quality of the music, then avoid this disc, unless you have money to burn. For this type of music you can do a lot better -- perhaps you can try the new Joni Mitchell. If you are in it for the quality of the music, I will make you a bet: if you don't make it all the way through the disc once, then I win; if you make it through more than once, then you win. I will get rich if enough of you make this bet with me."
1,GAG ME WITH CODY'S SPOON,Incredibly horrible. Janet Reno should rescue Giff and the kids from the clutches of this lunatic. Her vision of a concept album would sound better if Crackhead Bob was performing. The songs are all identically boring. Nothing going on here. Spend your money elsewhere.
1,Self-absorption at its most monotonous,"Kathie does it again with this collection of self-pity and self-worship. Read the liner notes for evidence of what a sick, sick mind she carries in her head. The backing tracks are essentially indistinguishable: hackneyed soft lounge music featuring souless ""jazzy"" piano tinkling. All this overlaid by the sounds of an aged, self-worshipping, never-really-has-been who desperately attempts to impersonate a torch singer. The cello was kind of pleasant, but the atonal singing ruined it."
1,Save your money,"Kathy Lee has a pleasant voice, but this one is sappy and doesn't do her or those who like her, justice."
2,Asleep at my Keyboard,"After listening to the provided tracks of this cd, I feel that it is bland and has little variety. Yes, slow ballads can be nice sometimes, but it was hard to tell one track from the other. She can sing, and the vocals were clear. Still, I didn't didn't feel the voice did much for me emotionally other than prepare me for sleep. I like ballads here and there, but on an album like this, I'd think it'd be important to put in a few classic faster songs. I think even Sinatra and others who did ballads put in songs with different sounds and tempos. I won't tottally trash Kathy Lee as she did make an effort, but she really should try to do something with more variety (be it classic)."
2,Is Kathy Lee now a singer ??,It wasn't bad enough that she imposed her personality on the public on TV. Now she is a singer !! PLEASE !!I bought and returned it the same day.
1,A Kathie Lee fan but not a fan of this CD,"I personally think this woman has contributed enormously to good causes, and I love her humor with Regis but............with a voice so rich this CD lacks, first and foremost... range. I kept waiting for her to soar...obviously I felt greatly disapointed. What happen Kathie Lee? Sign me greatly dissapointed and very very wary of a future purchase."
2,Disappointing,"I like to hear Kathe Lee sing, I think she has a beautiful voice, but was disappointed in this CD. There was not one single upbeat song on it. I prefer a variety of both slow and upbeat songs when I purchase a CD and this was slow slow slow."
2,Argghhhhhhhhh!,"I look up to and respect Kathie Lee,and I am also a fan of all styals of music. This album Was extreamly weak.I know she could do much better, even mellow music needs some edge. Somthing that leaves you with an experiance. It wasn't striking and it didn't seem real to me. Im trying to be constructive I am a Kathy lee fan."
1,Born for you,I was very dissapointed in the cd Kathie sounds very depressed and lonely she put me in a very low mood She needs something with an up beat she is a much happier person on the TV talk show Maybe she should have stayed with Regis
2,Sounds too much like songs for a lullabye,"Kathie Lee sounds like she is singing a lullabye to a baby. She needs to be more diversified, all of the sample songs have the same tempo and music. She just needs to get some good producers and writers behind her. I do think she has a lot of singing potiential. Maybe you can get something out of this cd if you are 65 and over."
4,"A toast, not a roast from an old comrad from high school!","Kathie Lee Gifford's new CD deserves a listen. For all you nay-sayers, I say. . .give her a break! You cannot dispute that beautifully tuned voice. She is a singer's singer. She sings from the heart and you need not agree with her to appreciate the phrasing and emotion in the songs she chose to showcase her life story. Kath, I've been listening to you since we were kids. Like fine napolean brandy, you do get better with age! Really loved your lyrics. Keep 'em coming!"
2,Born For You,"Kathy Lee Gifford does well with the slow gentle songs that are written for a breathy, slighlty raspy voice. I find her piece from Hello Dolly,Don't Let the Parade Pass Me By ....to be too much of a Streisand/Edder wannabe, while her pieces about childhood and love commitment, touching and more suitable for her voice. Her songs have conviction here. The major complaint I have about the album is that the instrumentals in the introductions all sound too similar. They have no distinction"
3,Coctail Music,"Cathy Lee sounds like a lot of smoky lounge singers. Nothing special, but a nice voice. Of course, that could be the music she chose. I would like to hear her sing something more lively."
1,you have to be kidding,"This was the perfect way for Katie Lee to leave the entertainment world. I hope that this is the last of her. Thank God she decided to leave TV, where her replacement seems to have found a whole new energy in the show. But this music ..... Ugh! She can't be serious. Save you time and money."
1,All the songs are the same,"This is a horrible CD. I was hoping for some good songs because of her voice. She butchered all of them. They are all alike. I don't know what else to say except buy this at your own risk. If you are an insomniac and need to go to sleep, this is the pill for you."
2,"repeat, repeat, repeat","kathie lee gifford is born to be a star. she does not need to have regis or anyone else stand in for her. the cd is over dramatic. everyone knows of her and frank's past, present, and future. she has made a stand for her man. this cd does not imply she is unhappy, even though you can hear it in her tone. where is the smile in her music. is she so overcome with the failures of and in her marriage that she must seek fulfillment elsewhere? Kathy, please come back to yourself. Be true to yourself, and let God fullfill your spirit. The flesh is willing. Is the spirit?"
5,Nature's First Green is Gold........,"I listened to the samples of her new album. I was impressed and especially like ""Here's That Rainy Day"". I definately will purchase the CD. Not only is this women talented...she has many other talents still not recognized by the entertainment industry. Don't stop making music and continued success to you Kathie Lee. Stefanie Jenamann"
4,Love the smell,Like how my hair feels and looks; silky and shiny. The consistency of the shampoo seems thinner than the small bottle I received at a recent resort visit.
5,THE BEST!!!,"As I mentioned in my review of the Tarocco Orange Nourishing Hand & Body Lotion I had the wonderful experience of first trying this product at a Resort & Spa in Illinois. This item is wonerful. I have very thin hair and this shampoo left my hair feeling fuller, soft, and shiny!"
5,More than just a ska band!,"The full length debut from one of California's best kept secrets, The Conspiracy, ""Too Far Gone"" combines funk, jazz, hip-hop, punk and, oh yes, ska. Armed with crisp guitar riffs, solid bass lines and punchy, melodic horns; this album will have you doing more than just tapping your foot. You'll be skanking like it's going out of style."
3,"Good book, if you have S-plus and authors' wavelet toolkit","A nice treatment of data analysis using wavelets. Very nonmathematical and intended to be used while seated at the computer. I was a little disappointed to see that it was so tightly bound to the authors' commercial S+Wavelets software, which seems to render it pretty much useless if you or your institution doesn't have S-plus and S+Wavelets. (R implementation, anyone?)"
5,Walker Resonator for Monte Carlo,"This walker resonator pipe exceeded my expectations. I purchased it as a replacement for a rusted out original on my wife's car. once the old parts had been removed, the installation of this resonator was simple. Nice seamless design that has a heavy wall. had the original part been seamless, I wouldn't have had to replace it since that's where the rust hole formed on the original part.I noticed slight damage on the exit end of the pipe due to shipping. it was only placed in a box without any packing material. a few taps with a hammer returned the outlet to a nice round shape that was easy to slide over the original exhaust pipe."
5,FANTASTIC,"i simply dont understand why quality music always end up unheard by the masses. this is a beautiful, well crafted soundtrack from an amazing animated movie (Les Triplettes de Belleville), it got excellent reviews worldwide, even from american critics who usually praise hollywood blockbusters.Well, the soundtrack is as excellent as the movie. This is the kind of music you spin when you throw a party, having some good red wine.So Make youself a favor and buy this record, it is well worth every buck you spend on it!!"
4,Great CD in Time,"I LOVED this movie, so I was psyched to get the soundtrack, and I love it! I fell instantly in love with ""Shake my Soul"" and ""beyond the Blue,"" but it did take some time for me to enjoy the whole CD. ""Few and Far Between"" and ""Rowdy Booty Time took some getting used to, but now I can honestly say that I enjoy every single song on this CD....besides ""Beat of the Heart""...I wasn't a fan of the song in the movie, and I guess I still don't like, but don't let that stop you from missing out on the rest this CD has to offer!"
4,Where The Heart Is,I bought the CD after reading the book. I was really impressed how well the CD went with the Movie. I really liked the song Just Might Change Your Life by the group 3 Of Hearts. Formerly the Girlfriendz. I also liked Thats The Beat of A Heart by the Warren Brothers.
5,THE BEST,"Hey email Dagrizzj@hotmail.com if you got ne info of 3 of hearts cuz i like that band but cant find ne background, but all i got a say is no matter what kind of music u listen to u will like this album its got it all, listen to it, ull see what im talking about"
3,A few good songs,"There are a couple of good songs, but a few not so good ones. But I really love that Beat of a Heart song, so I had to buy it."
1,who cares?,"Who cares what Casals thought about music? If you listen to his interpretation of the Bach Suites- it's shocking- at least compared to 100 different cellists performing them. So, to make it quick: Casals is the most overrated cellist of all ages!"
5,very sturdy case to protect your valuables,whatever electronic device that you may have that can fit in this case will undoubtedly be protected with this sturdy case.
5,A Must Have for Alt. Country Fans,Cropdusters latest is one of those rare allbums you find yourself playing over and over and never getting burned out. .Country tracks like Ca. Cotton and Crazy Uncle shine while Absentee and Nightown show their roots in the No. Cal Garage Mvt. A lot of great music packed into this album.
1,For Kids that's absurd. I'm disgusted,"I find this just appalling for kids, I mean who markets a toy for kids where they are wearing S&M. This is an adult cartoon and I find this toy NOT appropriate for children."
3,Acceptable...but...,"After listening to this album and believe me, this is far better than most of todays offerings, I am disappointed with the basic scat infiltrations in the album. A very similar voice to Stacey Kent, without the accuracy."
2,"Great Talent, Lousey Music","This album proves that great musical talent cannot redeem pointless music. Tierney's is as great a voice as I have heard in decades, but this album is one to skip."
2,Before You Buy,"I purchased this CD based on all the positive reviews here. I have now put the CD back in the archives of music I will probably never pull out again. There is just way too much ""scat"" on most of the numbers. I just can't tolerate scat. In the middle of the third listen I just could not take it anymore. Banished to the archives it went. The musical backup is top notch and recording quality is superior but does not overcome bob idddy bop pob dah dah dee la dah dopp and so forth. But hey, If scat is your thing you will love it."
4,Fascinating As Any Novel!,"The election of a politically unknown African American as a Republican representative from Oklahoma was news. The story of how he arrived there is as fascinating. The book is so refreshing in that Watts recounts both his successes and his failure - all the experiences of a teenager are there.The issue of race did not trap Watts into forgetting he was a man who could think for himself. The book is fully of amusing stories.Even those who do not share his views will find this a delightful reading experience. Borrow a copy from the library or better yet, secure your own."
5,More than just politics,"This book is more than just politics. It's more an autobiography that comes from within and reveals a man who is moral, principled, God Centered and simply tries to do the right things. It is because of this combination that he is a conservitive."
5,Very Pretty,"Product as advertised. Very sweet for a new mom, without being too obvious when she wears them."
4,Fun RPG,"The game leans a bit heavily on verbose and too often philosophical dialogue cut scenes, which often ends up producing really awkward dialog. A lot of the characters will feel pretty contrived and flat--but then again, all of the characters *are* contrived, in the game, by a man in a coma. Overall, it's a very interesting story, and the actual game play is really fun so far."
3,"Looks Great, but Boring Plot and Characters","The game has an interesting premise and looks great, but that is about all it has going for it.The characters are too innocent and juvenile and the voices get to be grating after a while (it is like watching a children's show on tv).The plot is also not very grand, at least for a long stretch in the beginning. You embark on an adventure to convince your monarch to lower taxes on your method of healing. Sounds exciting, I know.The game has some adult themes in that some characters are discriminated against or murdered, but the game as a whole seems like it was aimed at children."
2,You'll have fun until the graphics wear thin...,"Well, it's hard for me to recommend this game. Most of the redeeming aspects of the game have nothing to do with gameplay and the poorly done aspects are basically everything about the gameplay. The two pros are its graphics and music. If you can find a youtube compilation of the all the cutscenes and a soundtrack to the game, you'd really be experiencing all the good aspects of the game without having to suffer through actually playing it. This is a title I can only recommend to people who love JRPGs to the point that they'd enjoy a bad one.To me, the game is a cake. A beautifully adorned and intricately sculpted cake... that's rotten, maggot infested and totally unfit for eating unless you think food poisoning is awesome.Full Review Here: [...]"
2,kinda boring,"imma usually a role playing type of gamer. but this new generation system has boring rpgs. xbox 360 has more rpgs than ps3. but so far they are all kinda boring. blue dragon had big names but was not very fun, but you can get through it. i first saw this game called trusty bell and have been waiting for the north american release. but this game is extremely boring, i found myself not wanting to watching any cut scenes and just skip through it. graphics are nice, story is boring. i also finished mass effect, which is pretty much a copy of ideas from star wars/starship troopers and other sci-fi movies, but at least it was more fun than either blue dragon/eternal sonata. so far, rpgs have been a complete failure for this generation. next i'm waiting for fable 2. i'm not all that interested in FFXIII after how boring FFXII was."
4,Eternal Sonata,"Pretty good, but not the greatest game ever. I would recommend this game to Anime fans because it has a wonderful art style... But personally, I didn't find the game play to be all that interesting, doesn't mean that it's a bad game, I just don't like it all that much.However fans of games like this will definitely love it."
3,Eternal Sonata,"Role playing game for someone who has sometime for game playing to go through the story line of the game. Animated and kid like but for some who like games that are a bit out there, a good buy."
3,only if you like jrpgs,"Must play, but only if you like Jrpgs.Its clever and inventive, but still very stereotypical.ARGH THE VOICES, they are my biggest complaint, so terribleAs I get older I like these games less and less, and I feel embarrassed playing them.If you haven't played Lost Odyssey and Tales of Vesperia try those first"
3,A painful way to pass the time,"I'll start off by saying that I'm a sucker for any kind of RPG's, especially bad ones. But this one is painstakingly boring. The puzzles and mazes in this game made me want to gouge my eyes out, not continue playing. They aren't challenging nor fun, they're simply tedious and have little payoff other than an even more excruciating cut scene. The fighting takes the cake in horrible-ness though. Fighting monsters is so tedious that I spend most of my time just trying to avoid them.the plus side, it was great to begin with, the colors are vibrant and the character design is cute, however after awhile it starts to not make up for the horrible gameplay. It's something simple and easy to pass the time with but I suggest investing your money in to a much more enjoyable RPG like Fable 2 or Dragon Age."
5,Cutscences are what this game is all about,"The game play may not be all that great, but it's still fun though.This big thing about this game is the cut scenes; you just want to keep playing to find out what happens to polka next; it's almost like watching some anime.I found the game to be interesting and that whole thing with chopin interesting too, and there are a lot of deep symbols in this game, that goes very deep into human nature; if you listen to all the cut scences you might just learn somthing."
2,This is only ALRIGHT,"I've had this bike for about 3 years now. I don't like it much because a lot of the things it tells you isn't accurate at all. The speed thing is not accurate all the time. It told me I was going 300mph once -_-. Really? If that's THAT wrong, then the calories burned can't be accurate either, or the distance traveled. The seat isn't comfortable. I always put a pillow on it when I'm using it.The only things I liked about it is that it was a lot cheaper than other bikes that I wanted, and it takes up less space. Now that I've had this bike for so long, I wish I would've just bought the other bike I wanted. It looked SO comfortable!"
2,resistance dial,"This was ok in the beginning, but after 6 months, the resistance dial failed....it is now stuck on 3 and will not budge in either direction."
3,Good bike uncomfortable seat,"Just got it today. Put it together in an hour. Not the easiest job but everything works and looks good. The bike is quiet and the display has all the basic info. (calories, distance, speed etc.). The only drawback is the uncomfortable seat. I'm currently using a soft throw folded into a square for comfort. I'm going to order a gel seat cover for the bike that you can find here at Amazon. Overall not bad for the price."
5,Great for the price,"This is a great little exercise bike for the money. I wanted something small enough to keep in the living room. It has rollers so can be moved easily if necessary. Be warned: the maximum weight limit for the bike is 250 lbs. If you are very large, I would go up a bit in size. It is small, but that's exactly what I wanted so it fits the bill for me. My husband is 215 lbs and 5'10"" and he's happy with it, too. OK, it was a little trying to put together, but most self-assembly things are."
5,timeless,"This is just a great song. If your a sap for fairytale romance and true love, this sums it up. Very well performed by Kidman and Mcgregor."
3,"Cute little story, dated.","Cute little story, came with a book mark which was a nice touch. It has been a while since she worked there but it is a nice little personal piece to the extensive yellowstone history."
2,"Didn't dethatch, damaged lawn","I was hoping this would work but it didn't. I set the deck high to start and tried it. I lowered it and tried again until it touched the grass. It pulled up more live grass than thatch. It actually didn't pull up very much thatch. It ended up shredding the existing blades, leaving ragged, damaged ends. Luckily I only did a small area but I'm worry that it may have damaged it.It also says it is recommended for gas mowers. I have an electric mower. It says you can use it as long as you keep a constant speed, which I did."
4,Great conversation piece,"If you love Shakespeare get it. These cups will make you smile as you quote some of the most infamous lines the bard ever wrote. The cups are not necessarily the best quality and are a little too expensive, but still worth it."
2,TAIWAN,The resolution is not good in these pictures.The color is not very good in these pictures.Some of pictuers are drawed not to photograph.
5,entertaining book in life of the newly married Rhys,Young Mrs. Rhys looking for a washstand encounters an accident with a truck on lonely road and ends up stranded with culprits thinking she's dead. Inspector Rhys hunts for the suspects while keeping Jenny out of harms way at her brother and one coincidence leads to another.
5,Great Gospel,"What a great surprise! Powerful voice, perfect, soulful background singers and an understated, yet powerful band. Song after song hits the groove. This almost sounds like a Ry Cooder album, complete with stinging slide guitar, but with better vocals. The Garrison Keillor song (""You Must Come In At The Bottom"") is my least favorite, but even it is worth a smile. This record is tremendous!"
4,RCBS Precision MIC,Good product exept I found the shell device useless in my 308 - looked like it was for a 223.
4,Works.,It works. It does. It does work. What I attempted to do with this bit (drill some holes in some steel)...it did.
5,So glad I trusted my instincts!,"I picked up this book on a total whim. The saying is that you can't judge a book by it's cover, but sometimes that's more true in the metaphorical sense than reality. I admit, I judge books by their covers nearly every time. Some good cover art, or even something clean and simple, and I want to read the back or inside jacket. This cover caught my eye. It's very Playbill meets that Blind Melon video with the little girl in the Bee costume. (No Rain? Maybe? I think? It's been too many years since I've watched MTV and I doubt they'd ever play it anymore anyway.)It's more than a cool cover, though. It's hopeful, and funny, witty, down-to-earth, and SO inspirational. It's more than a coming-of-age story, because it's also a story of success. It's a true testament to the grit that comes with knowing what you want and being too stubborn to settle for anything less no matter what obstacles are in your way."
4,entertaining memoir,This is the story of what it's like to grow up seriously obese. Sharon Wheatley's story is sometimes funny and sometimes pitiful. It's like Judy Blume's Blubber come to life. Imagine being called compared to a heifer in class and in front of a teacher who decides to do nothing about it. Imagine having a sales clerk who should at least try to be nice in order to sell you more clothes refer to you as gross within earshot of you. Sharon dealt with all this by becoming a jolly good sport and by throwing herself into her music. Later she looses weight and makes it to New York and Broadway. This is a pretty good memoir. It sympathizes with fat teens but doesn't tell them that it's okay to just make the pain go away by indulging in a food binge.
2,Wasnt in stock...,wasn't in stock when online it said it was.. took about 2 and a halfweeks to get the item. Customer service was helpful but only after i emialed first.
1,[Price] for ONE GOOD SONG!,Silent Lucidity is the ONLY song that makes this CD worthy of being bought...for any sum of money.
2,FLIMBSY! NOT FOR CLIMBERS!,If your little girl likes to climb on things beware of this doll bed. The plastic is not strong like Little Tykes or Step2. My daughter (2 yrs)was climbing on hers and the plastic snapped and down she went. Fortunately all she got was a little scratch. Unfortunately she still has no fear of climbing. If your child is a climber do not purchase this. Spend the extra $ and get one that you know will stand up to your curious and adventurous toddlers.
5,Great American-Made toy for $20.00!!!,"Just finsished assembling this toy for my Granddaughter. VERY fast and easy assembly!! Great picture instructions.My granddaughter will LOVE it. The cradle rocks, there is an attached high chair that has a comb, fork, spoon, andplate and what is supposed to be a bottle (but looks more like a salt shaker) . I would recommend this toanyone looking for a gift for a little girl. The only thing that needs to be added is a doll bottle, or at leasta sippy cup. VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE!!!!!!!!!! Made in the USA!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Wasn't happy with at all!!!,"Toy is poorly made, and my daughter has hardly used it - the dolls fall out of the cradle part. Not happy with this toy for the price."
3,Quality in Line with Price,"Comes in a bunch of poke-out plastic parts, some of which left rough edges, but overall was pretty easy to snap together. My daughter played with this for about 6 months before I tossed it."
4,Muddy Live,"~ Excellent performances by Muddy and his band consisting of James Cotton (harmonica), Otis Spann (piano), Pat Hare (guitar), Andrew Stephenson (bass), Francey Clay (drums), and of course Muddy on vocals and guitar. Otis Spann does the vocals on ""Goodbye Newport Blues"", which prominently features his piano playing.~ The recorded sound for the live performances is good but not great.~ Recommended as a good starting place to hear the music that influenced so many young British blues-rockers.~ There is some confusion in the Amazon listing of this CD released in 1990 and the more comprehensive CDAt Newport 1960released in 2001. The reissue contains the live performance recorded at Newport on 3 July 1960 plus four studio tracks recorded in June 1960 with the same band. For that reason I gave this recording only four stars and the more complete CD (available at a lower cost) four and a half stars."
2,Eh.,"At the time, for the money, this laptop was ok.The Vista business OS really killed me though and I had to swap it out with XP."
1,Poor quality!,I purchased two of these sprinklers and both of them broke within a couple of weeks. The head popped off both and the design will not allow them to be screwed back on tightly. I contacted Gilmour for assistance and my emails have gone unanswered. Don't waste your money. This company does not honor the quality of their product.
2,Object - Oriented Programming,"This book was hardly usefull to me.Firstly, most of the examples doesn't work out the way it is suppose to be.Secondly, Visual Basic 6 doesn't support some of the functions for example when you create a new class i was adding a new student to the CStudent class.(objStudent.Collection.Add objStudent)The Collection class has a single build-in (read-only) property called Count that returns the number of objectsin the class.The build-in methodsof the Collection class are Add, Remove and Item.P.55 from the first paragraph.I would like to know by the time the Autor was writing the book, what version of Visual Basic what he using???"
4,Long bit,Have not used yet but the Dewalt company is a good and dependable one. We feel sure that this bit will be very reliable and of good quality.
5,Correct Size,It is sharp and the correct length and diameter. I bought it to make a hole in a location that had obstructions blocking the drill motor with a shorter drill.
5,IDM / Electronica of the Finest Caliber,"There are two extremes found commonly in electronic music. You've got music that's extremely repetitive with catchy hooks, and then there's music that's extremely complex but lacking melody and continuity. This album feels perfectly centered between the two. The melodies are beautiful and smooth, yet the rhythm and arrangements are intricate and structured with great care. The result is an album you can listen to over and over without tiring from it. Definitely a must-have for music fans of any background."
4,Great physical insight solving radiative transfer problems,"This text covers a broad range of topics in radiative transfer with clarity and style. What is particularly appreciated is that the text not only provides detailed solutions to radiative transfer problems, but discusses their weaknesses and strengths in practical applications, and also provides unusual insight into their physical meaning. My only complaint is that the notation is somewhat unconventional (for example the single-scattering albedo is represented by 'a'), and this takes some getting used to."
3,Too much information,"The title says it all. Book is wordy, repetitive and full of Gary pride. But he's about the best ever from the sand so if you can stand it you will benefit."
1,Not much help for novice or expert.,"Like so many books on computer technology, the authors seem to think you need to know how the engine works in order to start the car, so they spend 100 pages explaining the technical inner workings of cyberspace, FTP, gophers, veronica, jughead and other stuff that you don't need to know in order to click the mouse on ""search."" If you want to know the technical stuff, find the nearest Alpha Geek who will be more than happy to explain the inner workings of the 'net to you in terms you still won't understand. This book has a 1995 copyright, so do I even need to mention that the 200 pages of resources in various disciplines is woefully outdated? I think not."
4,Enjoyed by 2 & 4 yr old,"I bought this toy for my almost 2 yr old daughter for Christmas & it has been her favorite gift of the holiday. My almost 4 yr old daughter also enjoys playing with it. A nice, quiet, entertaining toy!"
2,No quality control,"Rec'd this item and two entire rows of beads were missing. I purchased this after reading several bad reviews and took a chance. Unfortunately, I didn't heed thier advice. There is apparently no quality control at this company. If your looking for a similar toy, try a different manufacturer."
2,Very wobbly,"Although my grandson really likes this toy, the quality is nowhere what I expected. as the base does not stay level on the floor."
1,Disappointing Results,The only good thing about this kit is that your child can get some joy out of painting a few volcanoes on a cheap plastic sheet. But the real promise of this kit--to see a model volcano erupt--may not be fulfilled. We followed all the steps and got tripped by a poorly designed base (above mentioned cheap plastic sheet) that is extremely difficult to balance on 4 ill-fitting stilts. A poor experience for the kids. The eruption was more of a fizzle. Waste of money and time.
4,Gibson Brite Wires,"These are the strings that came stock on my Gibson Les Paul. They sound great, and stay in tune very well too. The only issue I have with these strings is that after about a month, my high E string breaks while tuning. This has ONLY happened with these strings, and not the other brands I have used on this guitar. Still, this issue could be the fault of the tuner or nut on my particular guitar, but it has happened 3 times now with these strings. These strings do sound better than the other brands I have tried on this Les Paul, which is why I keep going back to this brand. The sound is what matters, right?"
3,Good but doesnt go into alot of detail,"It is very vague on alternative powders unfortunately, and does not explain the paper cartridges in detail i recommend looking online if the information is not enough for the cartridges you are using as there is bound to be a more in depth explanation out there."
1,Not worth it,Very superficial. The quiz at the start of the book and the answers later on are annoying and not very helpful. The authors try to debunk several popular notions and then create some of their own.The charge by volume only concept is not explained at all. The paragraph about casting bullets is OK .
1,Clarence Munford's book is a lot of rhetoric and little fact,"Munford's extravagent claims are reproachable. I would like to cite specific example. On page 332 he asserts that a re-segregation of the economy would cause cultural extermination. On page 528 he realistically explores the possibility of a north-south nuclear conflict. ""Only by triumphing over... white supremacy world wide...can we achieve... a victroy"". It scare me to believe that such a qualified and respected professor in the black community advocates essentially a coup-de-tat, of white control"
2,Failure to read History,"Like most of the books concerning reparations the authors fail to read and or understand history. Once again Mr. munford fails to understand that racism etc, etc are problems of humankind (sin if you will). Focusing on whites only is just another form of racism. Even today, much like ages ago, it is people of color who either still enslave of violate the rights of women and religious minorities.Reparations remind me of the Afro-American concept of signefying: you know!! yo momma is this, yo daddy is this. Reparationists know that most whites arn't racist but to maintain white guilt and empower black Americans this is their path. I am also convinced that many Black Americans miss the days of obvious racism, it gave em something to talk or bragg about.."
3,This is not what was mailed to my house,This is not the item i received when I opened the box.. the one i got had different pieces and a different colored board.. mine is an oak color and the pieces are brown and black.. even the chess pieces. The cards are pretty cheap playing cards. You have to be REALLY careful while you are playing too or you will end up with the pieces all in the bed.
5,Hopefully...,"I haven't read the book yet and I hope it gets here in time for Christmas, but I have read all the comics on Reallifecomics.com which are essentially the same comics contained in the collection. I started reading real life back when it started (yes, when it was still with keenspot), and it's definitely one of my favorite webcomics...right up there with Penny-Arcade and PvP. I'm certain that the book is fantastic and the comics contained within are not only incredibly humorous, they are also very accessible for readers that aren't into video games and computers. I'd go as far as saying that it's at least as accessible as Dilbert or Foxtrot...your Grandmother could understand these comics and still laugh, they're that good."
2,Not for use in the woods!,"The Bushnell Yardage Pro Legend is the waterproof version of the Scout. It is a solid feeling unit with excellent sensitivity. I was able to range on a pencil-sized twig at 60yds. and a 6"" fence post at 250yds. IN THE OPEN. Unfortunately, this sensitivity seems to be a disadvantage in the woods! I could not get a reading on a 16"" tree at 50yds. because there were some unseen (by me) twigs between me and the tree. The zip mode only works for >150yds. and in fairly open terrain. I will be returning this unit. The Nikon 400 works better in the woods."
5,Fantastic!,"So cool, it floats, it ranges and the price wasn't too bad either. I have looked at others but I wanted something small, light, and rugged for hunting. Where I live you maybe get shots out as far as 200-300 yards max so this works just fine."
1,One of the worst I've ever used!,"I spend a lot of time in the outdoors and have been using GPS a long time and have seen lots of units. This is by far the WORST GPS I have ever seen or used! I'm leaving it on my dashboard hoping someone will steal it and put me out of my misery.The base map is hideous! Roads are simply thin little red lines on a white background. If you'd like to see what they are like...get out a sheet of paper, draw a line on it with a pencil. That's what they look like! I kid you not! That's all the detail you get!At first I thought it was the zoom level so I zoomed in all the way thinking I'd get more detail....NOPE..ok zoom all the way out for more detail....NOPE!Don't be fooled by the satellite overlay either. You get 4 free overlays and the rest you have to pay. If you go to remote areas for your activities they may or may not have an overlay for that area.Please....go with any other GPS and safe yourself from despair!"
4,"Powerful images, compelling text.",The combination of photos and text is powerful. Grapes of Wrath updated and illustrated.
3,Not Bad,"Good for the money I spent. Straps are brittle leather and when I tied them, one of the straps broke. Leather is very stiff and the ink fades on light colored items put in bag.They are sturdy bags and I think they will last."
3,Nice looking..,"Nice looking, don't get them wet! Not real leather, as long as they never get wet, they'll last."
4,A Modern t\Take on the Torah,Rabbi Artsen provides a short synopsis of the weekly Torah Portion. The Rabbi then writes three different encapsulated views about the parasha for the week. The author brings modern insight to the ancient laws of the Jewish people.The book is written with the plan to bring the Torah into our lives sprinkling a daily taste of the ancient scrolls into our lives. I recommend this book for those who want to try understanding the Torah by getting a quick read daily and perhaps use this to whet our apatite for the full version of the Five Books of Moses.
4,Good book,I liked the way this book made me realize my potential. I also recommend a book called Dreams: Gateway to the True Self.
5,good drill bit,did not work for what i wanted it for but its a great bit i would buy again works great
1,Gray Market Batteries?,"First of all, as another reviewer mentioned, the batteries were rolling around in the UPS box when they arrived. This is because the original product packaging was open, probably due to age and storage issues. The batteries expire in 2015, at least two years earlier than AA batteries currently sold in stores. Furthermore, ""For Europe only"" is written on each battery, indicating that these batteries are from the gray market, discontinued odd lot, or obtained from some other less-than-above-board channel or means. Don't buy these. I never write reviews, but this item is clearly sub-par, and Amazon should not be selling it. I'm returning mine or otherwise asking for a full refund."
1,Don't bother,"Terrible packaging, and terrible product. I have used Sony Alkaline batteries before and have had very good luck with them.These look different, like they aren't to be sold in the U.S. They aren't the same quality as I have used before either. Very poor battery life. I ordered four packages and all of the packaging wasdefective. All of the batteries were loose in the box. They are cheap, but not worth it."
1,Upset with Amazon,"Unfortunately I don't know if the product was good or not. When I received the batteries which were part of a gift, the battery package was all taped. Either the batteries were returned or the package was damaged and someone taped the package. This was upsetting to me since they were to go with the radio that I ordered. I can't understand how anyone would send them out in the condition they were in when I was ordering something that was new."
2,Looks better than it really is,I purchased these for my daughters bedroon wall they dont stick very well and also are all quite small - I also thought the colors would be more vibrant then they actually are
5,love it,my daughters room is adorable with these added friends. she loves them too and is always pointing to them and laughing
3,Nietzsche's little book of wisdom,"If you are interested in understanding Friedrich Nietzche's philosophy this little book is a great place to start. In this book the philosopherwho coined the phrase ""God is dead"" has two other ones ""What does not kill you makes you stronger"" and ""Do not spit against the wind"", I did not know he was the originator of these more popular ones. He was the first immoralist who believed that freeing the world from a make believe God and our accountibilty to him was the true way to redemption. He was one of the first antagonists to Christianity and disagreed with Christian morality. He thought guilt was terrible. Buy this book if this sounds interesting. I have always found his writings deep and memorable, he was way ahead of his time in the 19th century. He was truly a great thinker whether you agree with him or not. This book can be read in a little over an hour."
5,Team Leadership,This is a great book for developing team leadership and a culture focused on accountability. I plan to use this book every year to set the ground work for the season.
5,lingerie,I like these bras. They fit really well and are very comfortable. They are very reasonable in cost and I have bought them on Amazon before. I will look for them again when I the need arises.
5,Pretty good show,"Got this for $2.19, using a gift card I earned free here: swagbucks.com/refer/Animallady1234.This set comes two DVDs, volumes 1 and 2, volume 1 of the manga and a guide book. The anime and manga are a little different, but both are still good. It should come with instructions on how to open it though. Took me a few minutes to figure it out, almost ripping the top off. The easiest way to open it is to hold both the top and base at the same time, sliding them apart. But make sure it's upright when you do, or the DVDs and books will fall out."
4,Great fun but a few things you should know,"This toy was great for me (an adult), but I'm not sure an 8 year old would have the patience for it.A couple of tips: 1) Read the directions through before starting. 2) Don't confuse the white paint with the contact cement. 3) Save a little of the brown and black paint to reapply over the white paint if it gets too light.A couple of flaws: 1) There aren't enough rocks to make the waterfall look like the pictures on the box. 2) The pump works fine, does not leak or anything, but the sound you hear when it is on is primarily the motor running, not gurgling water. (This is lessened when you take the cover off of the motor, so perhaps playing with the wire positioning, etc., would reduce the motor noise.)However, I *LOVED* putting this together and am satisfied with the results."
5,WOW MAN...,"This is some crazy stuff right here. Japanese psychadelic monsters Acid Mothers Temple have created another slab of thick riffage and crazy ambience. For fans of early Monster Magnet, Electric Wizard, and Boris, this is for you."
3,2.5,"While this release did nothing to change my overall opinion that these guys make frustratingly messy, overlong dirges, it is the most I have enjoyed an AMT release. This is mostly down to the first half of the title track, which has a fun riff and groove. It is almost ruined completely by the awful sound quality, but not quite. And before the song wanders off into boringland I found myself nodding along wondering why they can't always be this good. So that's about 10 minutes I've honestly liked from the hours of sludge I've braved through from these guys.Psychedelic, trippy music that should appeal to me, yet never does."
2,knife sharpener,This product was very disappointing. No matter which way I tried I could not get it to sharpen my knives
5,recommended by my cooking instructor,"I was taking a cooking class that was all about knives and part of it covered sharpening and honing them, which I found interesting but someone intimidating, especially with all the talk about getting just the right angle on the blade.Finally, our instructor let us in on a little secret...you could get one of these and it might not be quite as good as a professional knife sharpener that is actually a master of their craft (as opposed to a butcherer or over-grinder of your knife blades), but for just a couple of bucks this pocket sharpener does a darn good job and is pretty dummy-proof.I know you can buy these locally somewhere...I'm sure I could have hunted one down to save a few bucks over what I paid on Amazon, but to have it delivered right to my door rather than spending hours looking for one was really worth it. I had two really dull but good quality knives in my kitchen, and in less than a minute I had two really sharp and honed knives."
5,great for price,It is great to have a sharp collection of knives again for such a small price. Many of my knives were unusable and now I can keep them very sharp. Easy to use; just follow the simple directions.
2,Not so hot,For pocket knives it cannot sharpen the begining part of the blade evenly due to how the carbide and ceramic rods are set up. Larger knives might work better.
4,Fast and Dirty,"This little implement and cheap good knives changed my approach to cutlery...probably for the worse. Instead of worshiping craft and steel, and babying my tools, I now have very sharp knives, all the time, easily. Carbide side VERY aggressive, to be used VERY sparingly. This thing will put a good edge on anything. Will ruin your knives, eventually, so then buy new ones. Can't say I'm proud of this attitude, but as a salad, soup, and stew lover, sharp knives make all that prep work easier."
5,Excellent quality...,I was very pleased with the Starburst Celtic Knot round sterling silver earring...i have small ear lobes so i have found a gold mine!!!! I will definitely purchase more earrings from this company.
2,Too small for an adult,"I purchased these as a Valentine's gift for my sister and she is petite; however, she felt they were too small for her....were more appropriate for a tween or teenage girl. Luckily, she has a tween daughter to whom she can give them."
5,Takes me back to my childhood Saturday morning cartoons!,This is wonderful addition to my collection. The hand drawn cartoon grafics were very funny to watch.
1,Information on Box,There should be information on the box that lets you know the dvd cannot be used on a combo VCR/DVD player.
5,Very interesting,"I bought this DVD for my 85-year old dad. He loves Mario Lanza. I viewed the DVD with him. Indeed, the Caruso story is fascinating and it's always a pleasure to hear Mario Lanza singing. I never saw the original version, but this DVD is of great quality, great colors and sound."
4,What a voice,"For thoes who love a great voice this is the movie for you. The story line was ok,not knowing the Great Caruso himself I can only hope it was true enough. I was a bit disappointed in the ending as I thought it was too rushed but apart from that a good couple of hours of wonderful entertainment."
5,"Lanza, still the best!","I have been in love with this movie since first seeing it in the theater when I was a child. I am watching it again today, and it is still very good. I am moved by his singing like no one else's. The movie has so many musical numbers, it is wonderful. I just wonder why there was never a sound track from the movie, at least I have never been able to find it. The Ava Maria number still brings tears to my eyes!"
2,YUCK,HANDLE IS DETTACHABLE SO IT IS ALREADY LOST SO NOW THE GATE IS PRETTY MUCH NO GOOD-CAN'T CHANGE OR TIGHTEN IT
4,Flimsy,"The gate has lots of options for mounting. We used the pressure mount with a swing hinge. It works good, but is a little flimsy. The baby nor the dog can move it once it is locked down, but when it is open it looks twisted."
1,Blah!,Brackets are really cheap and are NOT strong. Don't be misled by steel brackets. The screws are small and when our dog hit the gate he destroyed them!! They are a twisted piece of rubble.Do not waste your money!
1,Easily Comes Apart,"I purchased this as a pet gate and in less than 2 weeks the guides popped out of the track. Because of this the gate will not maintain proper tension and is easily knocked over. It is hit or miss as to whether I can get the guides back into the track to actually use the gate. I contacted the company to inquire about a replacement and have gotten no response. Also, the operation of this gate is a bit strange. The lever that has to be put into the notch to secure the gate always feels like it is about to break when I push on it. Anyone who has dexterity problems may not find this the most user friendly gate. It's back to the drawing board for me in my search for ""the"" gate."
1,"$20 for the gate, then $2000 for the vet bill for a broken leg","We bought this and two days later our dog got its foot caught in the holes, breaking its leg. Get a different one with either bigger or smaller holes."
4,nice people to deal with at North States,My wife got a bit overenthused with the operating handle and snapped it. I called North States support and they had a replacement handle to me in a few days!
2,Can't use it anymore,"I have used these gates for several months. They serve their purpose, though they are remarkably frustrating to adjust, especially with a child at your heels. My problem with them now is that my 18 month old can climb the gate. I did not think of this months ago when I purchased the gates. The holes are large enough for him to fit his feet into, and the plastic is sturdy enough to provide him support to climb over. That makes these gates entirely pointless and unsafe."
4,Does it's job.,"Well, it's a pressure mounted gate, so it's bound to have it's flaws. It's not made to hold the weight of a ""persistant"" 1 year old and clearly states that the child should not be left unattended with the gate. We have had no problems with this gate. I find it simple to put up and easy to take down. It doesn't scratch walls or have places where the baby can pinch himself. The only time it comes loose is when a clumsy adult tries to step over it and misses.I'm only giving 4 stars though because I'm short and it's difficult for me to climb over the gate with a 27 pound 10 month old on my hip."
4,Decent gate if you don't mind painting,"I've had this gate for a couple of years now, and it works ok. I'm a little taller and can step over the gate with no problems. My daughter (5 year old) can climb over the gate and get out fine (our bathroom is on the other side of the gate). It holds securely and I have never had it fall over with my 17 mo old son pushing on it. I can't find anywhere that it will pinch my children at all and after I got the hang of it, it's easy to put up and take down. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is due to it has taken off the paint in the two places I have hung it in my house. The rubber stops that hold it against the wall are too sticky or something. I'm not talking just smudging the paint, it has literally ripped chunks of paint off my wall about an inch in diameter (the same size as the rubber stops.) I will need to repaint my hallway and doorway after I stop using it."
3,Dewalt drill bit,For a high speed drill bit it worked ok but was only a one time use bit. We found that even with working the bit slowly and using oil to keep heat down that it burned up on its first use on metal. Seller shipped fast though
5,tough yet like second skin,"My husband and I are making a stone patio. We both have been wearing this glove. These are impressive. When he handed me my pair, I laughed and said these won't last long. I'm on my tenth day of handling rough stone, hammers etc. for 6 plus hour days. They look like the day I put them on. My husband wore a few small hole on the top cloth area around his knuckles, but not the finger tips. One day after exhausting work I came into the house to write a check and noticed when I picked up the pen I still had the gloves on. Fit well I wear a womens small, the best fit I have gotten in a glove. They are flexible and not bothersome, like second skin. For the money they can't be beat. I will use them for cutting and stacking firewood as well."
4,loved the glove - hate the shipping,I first bought this glove at a local store which no longer handles them. I like the gloves enough to spend twice as much on shipping as on the gloves. They wear well and fit the hand so that it is easy to work with small objects. They are washable too
5,Great gloves for the serious gardener!!!!!,"Purchased these gloves for my wife. She is petite and finds it almost impossible to find gardening gloves that are small enough (even adult small) or large enough (kids large or extra large), but these gloves were ""just right"". They are tough, yet still give good tactile feedback on what you're handling and cutting. By the way, we purchased 6 pairs to make sure she doesn't run out of them. Based upon how tough they are, she should be set for a good long while...."
5,Hilarious!,"My husband and I both loved this. How refreshing to find such well-done comedy totally free of offensive material. Nearly all the rountines are hilarious! We particularly liked these routines: dating himself (Adam Johnson), the stupid inventions (Michael B), first-time hand-holding (David Nibley), the Sac. Mtg. talk (Shawn Rapier). The Apple Bros. and Jeff Birk were too silly for us, as were the ""Attack of the Handcart"" or ""Elder Werewolf"" skits. But it's great that this show features such a wide variety of comedy styles. The ""Hymnfir"" spoof (on Yanni, I assume) was very funny. If you're LDS, you're bound to find a lot of this DVD very funny. If you're non-Mormon, then you won't get some of the jokes, but a lot of this comedy will be funny for anyone. I have rented this DVD twice from Netflix, but now I will buy it. It's hard to find such good comedy."
1,retarded,I kept waiting for the joke to be over! This book was an easy and fast read but a total waste of time. Good thing I only paid a quarter for it from a yard sale.
2,Missing 2 pieces,"This puzzle was good quality and fun to do. However, upon finishing the puzzle, 2 pieces were missing. This was a major disappointment. I have purchased other Ravesnburger puzzles in the past, with no problems. Maybe this was a fluke."
4,what's all the fuss about,These puzzles are not so great. The pieces are all generally square in overall shape making it difficult to build. the seams show just like all the rest and the puzzle can not be lifted almost at all. But it is generally good as all the rest. Have not been able to find any puzzles like the old days where they could be lifted from any corner even when unfinished. Also they used to be fully interlocking and this was touted on the box and the pieces had radically different shapes and making it easier to locate them via shape.
4,Ravensburger rocks,Had a lot of fun putting this puzzle together. Not too easy. Not super-difficult. Relaxing and enjoyable pasttime.
4,Great puzzle,"This puzzle was addicting. The theme was fun, but it was still hard. Would definitely recommend to a puzzle enthusiast..."
4,Helpful tool,"I loved this book, but not enough to give it a five-star review, simply because it does not have an index. It's an easy read, and Tierno gives great examples. Short, concise, and informative, Tierno's book helps in every stage of writing, from outlining and pre-writing, to drafting and rewriting. Tierno gives hope along the way, and is not a gloomy look on the screenwriting business like so many other books are. So, give this book a chance. Just don't forget your highlighter"
2,Not at all useful,I wish I'd just bought the original Poetics. I didn't find this at all helpful. It's really quite a shame.
1,Not really worth the cost...NO women allowed!,This DVD was interresting but the original DVD description was very deceiving. Not what I was looking for at all. This DVD is all about the men and boys. Not much at all about the women in the communities other than just in passing. Its ok for learning the overall lifestyle or history of the amish but if your looking for anything at all about the women in the community...look elsewhere!!!!! I felt I had just thrown $20 in the toilet.
5,A peek into my lovely world.,I live amongst the Amish and Mennonites of Holmes County and I travel with my work. This DVD always travels with me and brings me back to the home I cherish when I am homesick. A very good look into the Plain life of our community and how they devoutly they keep their faith and lifestyle in an everchanging world.
3,"Interesting, but a bit empty","I really enjoyed this look into the various aspects of Amish life and culture in the US. Obviously they couldn't explore all the little details of each sect in a 50 minute program, but the overall scope was quite interesting. My only criticism is that there were many MANY shots of farms and people from afar, as well as some voice-overs, but no sit-down interviews with actual Amish people. It would have been nice to place a face with a voice and really relate to the story on a personal level. (Though that could be some Amish taboo I don't know about - and if so, mentioning that would have been nice.)Overall, a satisfactory introduction to the lifestyle of Amish in America. It made me want to know more, which I think should be the goal of any good documentary."
4,The Amish,Its nice movie on how the Amish live. It gives the viewer a heads up of what our forefathers went through w/out the modern conivences we have today.
4,Good gel pens for a good price,"Like these gel pens, writes without smearing on paper.Makes a good gift to students who still write on paper."
3,I'm Withholding Judgement,"This Story has a lot in the way of sequil potential. The prose was a little funky and hard to stay connected to, but you could see an underlying thread that may really play out in books to come. This is not by far the best or even most entertaining book I have read lately. But the ideas for the world created by author Laura Anne Gilman are great. With a better budjet, more time and less stress to get a book out and done I can see a lot happening with these charactors. Worth a look at the follow-up books."
4,staying dead,"good book, after building up the story, the ending came to a swift conclusion. Good book, if you like stories that continue on in a series with the same main characters."
1,"The writing was poor, the characters flat and forced, and the fantasy elements were even dull","Normally, I can't not finish a book. Even if its boring or poorly written I usually feel compelled to finish what I start. Unfortunately I had to brake my own rule with this book: I couldn't even finish the second chapter.The description on the back of the book sounded like the beginning of a promising new urban fantasy series, but this book started out boring and just got worse. The writing was poor, the characters flat and forced, and the fantasy elements were even dull."
1,Laughable,"If you are going to write SF, consider for a moment that many of the geeks in your audience understand the laws of physics and the flow of electrons. Heck I've considered electricity the closest thing to magic in existence for some time, but not in the hokey, schlocky way this author does. I'm willing to suspend disbelief in the name of a good story, but this tripe makes it impossible to do so."
1,"Personally, I put it down and it's staying down","I couldn't wade through all the myriad details of the opening chapter, nothing about the character or the setting grabbed my attention. Too bad."
3,"fun read, great characters","This book was fun and engaging, I really liked the characters. It got a little slow and repetitive a few times, as if the author wasn't sure how to bridge between the current event and the final destination. Overall very good and enjoyable though."
3,Urban fantasy with romance and mystery,"It started as a simple job, Wren Valere was to find out who stole the spelled cornerstone of the building, find it and bring it back. But nothing ever is that simple. Wren finds the spell on the cornerstone may not have been a simple protection spell as her employer claimed. That there may be politics involved looks certain after Wren partner Sergei talks to the Casa Nostradamus. Then Wren learns that Sergei's past may come to haunt her future. And that doesn't even take into effect that some group has twigged to the existence of Talents and fey and are killing them for sport.The world is similar to ours and this is very much an urban fantasy. Magic exists but in the dark corners of the streets, cities, and most people neither see it or believe in it. The characters of Wren and Sergei are interesting and the romance is so low key as to be almost non-existent and doesn't take away from an interesting mystery and Wren's twist in solving the case."
2,"The book didn't drag, dragging implies movement","I have to agree with several of the reviewers up to a point, the book didn't drag, since dragging implies movement. The author stalled out and never did get going faster then a turtle but please do not give up on the author. The second book in the series is better, I realize that since you don't know me you may not believe me but it does, it really does.Note: Several incidents in the second book reference back to the first book but if you didn't read it no fear, you can still enjoy the second book without reading (it may be better if you don't) the first book."
2,Staying Dead,"Most of us have lost things, right? People with magic do as well- and if it's something that they prefer no one to know they had in the first place, much less lost, they hire people such as Wren and Sergei to find said object and discreetly return it. In this case, the object is a magical protection cornerstone, and the ghost whose prescence is key to the spell. The ghost does not want to return, complicating Wren and Sergei's lives, as does the magical mafia that is after Sergei and all the various secrets floating around. Oh, and there's a small amount of romantic tension going on between the partners, but not enough to put off those who prefer to avoid romantic books. Unfortunately, it's not enough to really satisfy those who seek that sort of thing out. There are some promising elements to this book, but they go largely undeveloped."
1,staying dead is right.....,"You'll need to frequently check your pulse while reading this book-to see if it's still there. Sorry, put me in the ""nay"" catagory-couldn't hold my interest, boring characters, frankly the same old same old. How many more ""magic user heroine, demon sidekick, brooding older love interest"" can these Urban Fantasy authors dredge up?Not recommended."
3,Inoffensive addition to popular sub-genre,"The sub-genre of American urban fantasy has been getting popular in recent years. From the early high-energy days of Emma Bull and Will Shetterly, it has taken a turn towards a more romantic (in the genre sense)outlook, and has acquired its own tropes, which Ms Gilman's inoffensive effort dutifully incorporates - spunky heroine with super-powers, odd but useful friends and a close relationship with romantic undertones with the male lead (with the mysterious past), mysterious cabals with evil(ish) designs on Our Heroine, a client and an assignment that are Not What They Seem, etc etc. The elements are put together tidily, the writing style is grammatically correct and technically competent, and the whole thing is pleasantly unmemorable."
1,YUK!,"If I could give it less than 1 star I would. This book is so not worth the time it takes to pull it off the shelf much less to actually read it. I had to give it up on page 100, I just could not go on. I read the reviews available when I was looking for new authors, this one had good ones. So I bought it and it sat on my shelf for a while. I wish it had stayed there. It is sssslllllooooowwwww, and not much happens at all. What does happen is confusing and boring. Definately won't recommend this to anyone. If you want a good read check out Kim Harrison and her ""Hollows"" series. Now that's good reading!"
3,Interesting but confusing; likeable characters,"Interesting and creative world and I really like Wren and Sergei, but kind of confusing at times. An ok read; I look forward to reading the rest of the series to see if Gilman gets any better."
1,"Bad editing, worse writing...","I want to believe that this is inexperience coming through. That this book is sloppily written and badly edited because no one trumps experience; that things will get better as the writer is more comfortable with her words and her characters. I can't continue to read this book, I've stopped at page 147, I can not go any further. There are to many better stories and story tellers out there for me to waste my time. Maybe I will proven wrong and this author will become a great story teller one day, with this book it is not happening though. Very wooden characterization, very cookie cutter problems and ideas that should have been thought through before being put down on paper. Ms. Gilman will have her fans and that is fine, but until things pick up style and substance wise in her books, I'm not one of them."
2,hard to get,"Wren Valere is a Retriever - she finds things using her talent, usually when people don't want the police involved. She is hired through her negotiator Sergei, kind of as a safety. When Wren is hired to find the missing cornerstone of a business building, the case gets complicated by a ghost who was freed when the magic cornerstone was stolen. Apparently the cornerstone was for protection. I had a difficult time with this story - as much as I would like to like it, it was a little to technical for me - or maybe I didn't understand the way the magic works in that world, but I couldn't get into the story. As with many of Luna's novels, the stories are hit or miss, even if the cover art and blurb are attractive. There is a sequel called CURSE THE DARK."
3,Not as long as advertised,"The actual measurement of this drill bit was about an inch shorter than detailed in the description. Luckily, it was still long enough to drill into the engine of my car. Other than that, it served its purpose."
3,Eyewitness to a Marxist life.,"If you are looking for a well-researched bio into the life of Groucho Marx, look elsewhere. Arthur Marx's accounts of the Marx brothers' history is basically a rehash of the old stories Groucho had told him, many untrue and without additional research Arthur just tells them again. It is with his eyewitness accounts of Groucho's life that Arthur creates an interesting addition to the Marx booklist. From the ride back from Chico's funeral with Groucho and Harpo to his scathing attack on Erin Flemings influence on his father this book makes for an interesting read. Arthur Marx is a solid story teller and the book is an easy enjoyable read. Just don't confuse it for the truth."
3,Surprisingly not good...,The tonneau cover has a wrinkle or puckering in the fabric up by the back of the cab on the top left side. It's not only a visual problem but also lets in water. I expected more from TruXedo...
5,Could not be more pleased,"My Truxedo LoPro is the best tonneau cover I have ever owned. Easy to install, easy to move out of the way when hauling large objects and protects items that fit underneath. I've owned mine for 7 years and recently had a problem with some stitching (weather does that you know) and I can honestly say, their lifetime guarantee is just that. I am impressed and will own a Truxedo on my next truck."
5,Honda TruXedo cover,"I bought one of these for my son's 2007 Honda Ridgeline. Easy installation and great quality. I already had one on my 2003 Ford F150. 3 years old and still like new. You might pay a little more than others, but it is worth it!"
2,not as described or pictured,"I had two of these barstools which I bought a year or so ago and wanted a third to match... unfortunately, Hillsdale has changed the stool. It is not as pictured and is much lighter and cheaper. I liked the original stool which had a heavy base so that it doesn't slide around on the floor or tip over, the new stool has a cheap cone shaped base and slides around and easily tips. Also the footrest used to be welded directly to the base and now you have to screw it on so it is not as stable or strong. I'm very disappointed that the company cheaped out on this once great stool and had to return it because of the low quality and because it did not match the stools I have (which are pictured). I had also called Amazon prior to my order and they assured me that it would be just as pictured...but it wasn't ..."
4,Bar Stool,"I love the bar stool. I use it as a stool to play my guitar. The stool is well made and very comfortable...even when I play my guitar for hours. However, the stool was missing the set of bolts and allen wrench that was to be included in the shipment (as illustrated in the assembly instructions). It meant a trip to the hardware store."
5,Awww how cute,I simply adore this little harp seal. It is so cute and adorable. I think this is a wonderful educational toy for children. It's just the right size for a toddler and is child friendly.
2,Old and tired,"While there is a certain amount of truth in this book, there is also a certain level of underlying racism. Yes, it is true we (black people) as a race have many times, been the cause of our own demise, and yes, this is could be due to the biblical prophecy. However, what Ms. Andrews seems to be aiming at is a so-called biblical excuse for the actions of certain white people towards blacks, which is a very old and also very tired tactic. If we are going to solely rely on the Bible and take all of the things mentioned in it literally, then we may also say that the holocaust was the result of a biblical prophecy. For anyone who knows the Bible well and is truly intelligent, they will take the very meager pieces of information in Ms. Andrews' book and put it to memory and then throw the book away."
1,bible legacy of the black race,"THIS IS JUST ANOTHER FORM OF RACISM. THIS SOUNDS LIKE, ""IT'S OKAY WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE PEOPLE, THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER"". PERSONALLY, I'M OFFENDED."
1,Good idea-bad execution,"I agree with the reviewers here who thought the proofreading was atrocious, the writing hard to follow, and the story meandering. I never finished it."
5,Excellent,"A very unusual mystery/war story that I found difficult to put down. Well written, interesting, and good characters."
3,Peyton Place with Nazis,"How did Dorothy Sayers' couplet go? -- ""As I grow old and totter toward the tomb, The less I care who sleeps with whom""? Well, she wouldn't have cared much for this bed-hopping yarn. Too bad, Binding writes with a fine knowledge of the place and period and keen insight into humankind. And there's ultimately a murder to be solved here...but he doesn't get to it until page 111, for Sherlock's sake! By that time, watching the young women of Guernsey make sluts of themselves has become tiresome."
5,"Great Album!!!!!!!!!!!!!, Possibly,one of the best albums of all-time","What a great album.I have to admit that this album is so engaging and intelligent.Every track is a masterpiece.Everybody should have a copy of it.It is just awesome.It is hands down,one of my favorite albums of all-time."
5,The Great Yu-Gi-Oh Deck That Rules,The game is the best game in the world. But still it's hard as heck. But I always win. I do nothing but arange my cards and battle. It is easy when you have The Blue Eyes Ultimint Dragon.It is very easy. I don't see how someone can't like them. THEY ARE THE BEST!!!!!!
4,Yugi deck or Kiaba deck,"If u r a Yugi fan and your friend is a Kiaba fan doent be scared to duel your friend just because he has the Blue-Eyes their is a way to beat your friend draw the Dark Magician if u doent already have it in your hand then yous The Book of Secret Arts it will increase your attack points to 2800 and if u got the kiaba deck to but didnt get the Blue-Eyes yous renforcments to increase your atk to 3300 and then atk I will tell u some cards in the Yugi deck Feral Imp,Winged Dragon,Guardian of The Fortress#1,Beaver Warrior,Celtic Guardian,Dragon Zombie,Claw Reacher,Book of Secret Arts,Magical Ghost, Wall of Illusion,Dark Magician &,Summonend Skull u will not get any Exoida pieces in this deck ...trust in the heart of the card and duel the best u can"
1,decent,"its a good start for the yugioh fans out there, and in my opinion is better than the kaiba deck. Even though the kaiba deck has blue eyes white dragon this deck just has so many things that are better than that."
3,"plz look at my rating,it changes.somtimes",this is a very cOOl product for kids 6-32years of age.My little brother plays this game he is 8 i am 13 we both like it.so plz buy this product U WONT REGRET IT.
4,Compare this with other card games.,"Good lord this game is fun. Traps, Magic, no crummy costs like the others, except of course for the occasional sacrifice. You can't have more than 5 monsters out, which saves me because in Magic people would just fill up the board and destroy me.As far as Strategy, it's more or less simple, until you of course have to stop someones Dark Magician *cough* Dark Hole. Everything is plane and simple. Magic is much more confusing, with lands and enchantments and sorceries, blah blah blah. Pokemon is far to simple if you ask me so let's just drop that.So, if your looking for a game that's quick to learn and won't give you a heart attack with those pesky Counterspells,head for Yu-Gi-Oh!(O yes i know about Despell and Remove trap, but, in Magic there are, Foils, Rewinds, Thwarts, etc. All with the same ability and many more just the same. Yu-Gi-Oh at least has only made a few so far)"
2,"The kid with a 40-year-old voice hits the...., cards","I don't like Yu-Gi-Oh (go against the flow, eh?). This game has a 5/5 user rating, so I better at least attempt to lower that.Card games like this are a surefire way to [take] all your money out of your pockets. You'll look back in 5 years and think ""Aw ..., why did I spend all that money on cards?"". Its not worth it in the long run.So I disrecommend this. Still, its up to you.Fun: 2/5Its not the worst thing in the world, but still, its bad.Educational Value: 2/5I guess you may stimulate your brain trying to learn how to play.Durability: 4/5Well, come on, they're cards. They're not gonna break unless you step on them or cut them to pieces.Final [not an average]: 2/5"
5,man eater bug,"I was eating one day when I saw a yugi and I was like wow can this be that the head of this guy can come to heads to become ultimate or wil the magican of the power become the great force in the duel of the cards that were made by a dude that was hired by Kaiba corp and this is what he said to the hiring people ""Well Pegasus you have excepted to work with us"" ""Tight"" said pegasus dude I ate sometime and saw it in a dream that someay I would become a chicken and become a better dude like totlly can I take your Blue Eyes Man he was like aw aw aw aw aw aw aw aw awawawawawawawawaw no never obolisk attack lkdlknd with powerfukl doom attack ya man yamn hahahahahaha I win said the man with the eight eyeballs I have one The Yugi Starter deck boooooooooooooooooo I did say didnt I that I wood become a beep beep beep."
5,Yu-Gi-Oh! YuGi Starter Deck: Through a 12 year olds eyes...,"Personaly this is one of the best trading card games. It links in almost perfectly with the show, and is more popular that Pokemon. Many people ask: which is better? YuGi, or Kiaba? I say YuGi, because it has strong monsters backed up with very strong magic and trap cards. For all those parents out there, there is a lot of addition and subtraction too! (Just make sure we dont get addicted :) ) I advise all those kids that like pokemon, and RPG's to get this! It is VERY fun."
5,The Yu-Gi-Oh Starter Deck,I think it is very fun to dule and also I like to trade the cards I get to make a stronger deck so I would rate it betwean a scale of one to ten I'd give it a ten. I say it's worth the money.
5,Yugi Starter is the best!,"I have used the Yugi Starter for a large amount of time, back when the game first came out, this deck is great for teaching beginners simple elements of the game and one of the most basic rules of victory, winning through life pts. This deck should teach your child how to become better by using cards that are only included in the deck and that are exclusive only to starter decks. This also comes with a helpful playmat to teach beginners how to play and master the world of Yu-Gi-Oh!"
5,A great starter for any Duelist,"His starter deck I found is good but I wouldn't enter a tournament with it as is. It has a good number of cards but I found that many weren't strong enough for a good duel, unless your face another starter deck. Anyway I would recommend buying this Yugi Starter instead of the Kaiba Starter because the Kaiba one is based mainly on power. Where as this one is based more on strategy than brute strength."
5,It's Ok.,"The card game is very nice and addictive, but I do not reccomend this deck for power players. All but about three monstersin this dek stink like nothing else, and the deck relies on magic and traps rather than power. If your thekind of player that prefers power and speed, I reccomend Starter Deck Kaiba."
5,yugioh for everyone,"yugioh is a really great game. now i know that you guys have heard a lot of things about this game, and it is truley great. my whole high school, even seniors play. this is the only card game i've played that uses your brain. if you don't use any magic cards or trap cards, then give up right away. the yugi is a better one to start with, then after a couple of weeks get the kiaba deck.THAT IS ALL, THANK YOU AND GOOD DAY"
5,Yu-Gi-Oh!,This is the best trading card game of the whole year. I may not have any cards but I've used my friend Humza's Yugi deck and I defeated a 14 year old that had 2 Blue Eyes White Dragon and a Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon. If you are a parent you would want to buy this game for your kid's because they will drive you bonkers if you just say NO. Any way this is a must have game and that means you have got to get it.
5,... Review,"You use lots of strategy for the educational value, they are not very flimsy for the durability, and the are based on a TV show so they are cool."
2,What a waste of time.,"When I was a child, I did intelligent things like read literature, watch sesame street, and a lot of public television. I did not waste my time with decks of Mystical/Satanic cards. Time could be spent much better watching Tom and Jerry. Games like that, and most computer/console games should not be played until a person is mature enough to understand what they teach, such as satanic magic/witchcraft/sorcery. It's a shame that companies have started aiming adult age games and books at children."
4,"Pokemon, Digimon, and Now this!","I've been around the block a few times, and I can say from experiance that I know all about brief obsessions. Like pokemon, You battle an opponet and use strategy and skill to come out the winner.With Yugioh,it's twice as much fun and is a MUCH better and well thought out game. You can never master the whole game.It has many twists and turns that is exciting. This card game is EXQUISITE!!!!!! And it's not's exactly like the tv show, so it's new but, famaliar!!!! enjoy!!!!!"
5,this deck is soooo cool,this is the first deck I got it has a hole bunch of strong cards and people will trade with a lot of your cards so you can get new ones you got to get this cool deck now.
5,AUWSOME!!!,It's a real good starter deck its beter then kaibastarterdeck because it has beter cards.And over all its better.
4,the cream of the crop,yu-gi-oh the card game is truly the cream of the crop this willsurpass all other card games this has monsters trap and magic cards so I suggest u check this out if u want to know more about yu-gi-oh go to yugioh-card.com or upperdeck.com.
5,Yu-gi-oh! is THE BEST card game EVUH!!!,"Yu-gi-oh! is a very very very fun card game. Actually, I was a little unsure about the game at first, what with the hype and the anime show (which I think is stupid,but anyway). But after I bought a starter deck and played it out, I found it to be awesome. If you like video games, comic books, and card games, this is for you. I highly recommend you purchase a starter deck first (the Yugi one is the best of the two) and see how you like it."
5,YU-GI-OH! Trading Cards,This is very educational and a lot of fun! Kids can learn a lot of good thing by just playing this.
3,Not so great,"They are a lot larger than most, but they don't exactly work that well. They papers texture is almost like a wax paper, without the wax. They wipe off the oil but not exactly absorb. I found that you need to use more than one or two. I don't have oily skin but do get a little shiney by mid afternoon. I wouldn't recommend these if you have a problem with oily skin."
4,Little Miss Matched Kooky Hearts Bolster Pillow,"This pillow is very soft and comfortable. I didn't realize how long it was until it arrived, so be sure to pay attention to the measurements."
5,Russian Mary Poppins rocks!,"This is a wonderful Russian musical starring Natalia Andreychenko as Marry Poppins. Her partners in this interesting Russian version of the story are some of the best Russian actors - Oleg Tabakov, Albert Filozov, Sinoviy Gerdt, Irina Skobtseva and Natalia Udovichenko. The kids are very good in their roles,too. The story flows on the screen so naturally, thanks to great acting and music by Maxim Dunaevsky."
3,80 pages just too short,"""Figure Drawing Step by Step"" by Wendon Blake, Dover Publications, $7.95 ISBN0486402002Wendon Blake does a good job as far as his handling of the subject goes, and Dover books are often a tremendous bargain, as in this case at a price of $7.95. Anyone can afford to buy this book.Wendon Blake offers good instruction and there are even a couple pages of innovation in his method. However, at only 80 pages, this paperback is TOO brief a treatment of drawing, when it really is good enough to justify another 30 pages of illustration and detail. There are other books with much more illustration and drawing instruction as well, at a price not much more than Dover's to give this book a higher rating. Otherwise, it's a pretty good book."
5,Vitual Kasparov,"This game is the bast game I have seen yet,and I am a big Gameboy Advance critic.I love this game and I recomend it to everyone,and if you don't know how to play chess it will teach you and you will vs. many different chess players.It begins very easy and then gets harder as you work your way up.So if you have a Gameboy Advance you should go out and buy this game imediatly."
4,problems with tutorial,"The gameplay is fun and I feel that I am learning while playing, not working at learning the game. This alone makes it preferable to the Chessmaster software that is on my computer.The lettering used in the tutorial is very difficult to read. Had to go into sunlight to go through the tutorial.Have yet to find the letters to be used to save games. Could not find them on the save page. Games are saved, however when the Game Boy is shut off."
1,Great Idea--unbelievably bad sound!,"I ordered this game for the kids to play over the summer. With over 5,000 geography questions, I was looking forward to it myself! We were all very disappointed to discover that the sound was so bad that we couldn't understand the question most of the time. If you could understand Charlie Brown's teacher, then you'll love this game!"
3,Where in the world is the quality,"My nephew had the large version and I did not want a huge globe in my house so I bought this hand held version. The sound quality is terrible - I have to often repeat the question, However, my child does not seem to have the same degree of difficulty in hearing it so maybe that varies from person. It is a very durable item, we have it in the car and it has often been stepped on. Also, we leave it there in all sorts of weather and it has shown no ill effects.The globe is VERY small so it is not often helpful in finding the answers. I still like it though because I think it gets them looking at the whole world not just North America when speaking about geography. I would buy this again"
5,Great for kids who love geography,"My son absolutely loves geography - his favorite bed-time ""story"" is his atlas - and he loves this toy. We borrowed it from a friend for a weekend, and I'm planning on getting it for him for Christmas. OK, the sound isn't phenomenal, but as others have said kids seem to be able to understand it just fine. I can usually understand it as well. We didn't really depend on the globe to come up with the answers - if he didn't know the answer already, I'd give him hints or if it was completely outside of his realm of knowledge I'd just tell him what the answer was. For the most part I've just taught him names of countries, continents, and oceans, so this was a great way for him to start learning more detail."
4,Good Quality,"These are definately quality cars and look like they would be alot of fun. I purchased one for each of my sons, then 4yo and 6yo last year. Unfortunately neither really enjoyed playing with them for too long which surprised me b/c they both love to play with cars. Maybe a younger child would like these more."
3,does anyone know where these are made?,"I see some websites stating that they are made in the USA while others say made in China. That are kind of expensive, but if I was helping supply jobs here in the states I don't mind paying more. If they are being made in china by someone making $1.00 a day than no way, besides, even if they are lead free, who wants to give someone a gift and have to explain, ""Oh don't worry this is one of the safe toys from China!"""
2,Don't buy this book,This book is not for beginners at all. It's more of a reference book. This book doesn't even give examples to play around with so you can learn how to do it. This book doesn't cover the basics and is not worth 50 dollars.
2,Covers a lot but doesn't say much about anything,The Unleashed series are often very good. This one is certainly an exception. It covers a lot of ground but doesn't really go deep enough into absolutely anything. It was also written by many authors and one has a general feeling that the entire thing was just put together in great hurry. The book is inconsistent and repeats itself time and time again. There are certainly a number of better choices around.
4,Cheaper,"Much cheaper than buying it in the college bookstore, although I have to say I wish my school had chosen a different lab book. I found this book to be confusing in the way it was set up."
3,Not too bad for a Chem Lab Book,"Well, chances are if you're buying this, you have to for chemistry lab. Luckily, for you most of the lab questions aren't too bad or challenging, but I found the directions a bit confusing at times. I rewrote some of them in my own way before lab was to be performed and did fine. Maybe they'll make more sense to you, though."
4,decent,was a bit less than I expected. pages were fringed or half out. seems like all pages are there however.
4,Chemistry in the Lab,"The book was slightly more used then I was made to think it would be per the description. It had pages falling out, marking on pages, and a good wear to it. I did received it in a timely manner and it was not so harshly used that I could not use it. Overall it was slightly disappointing but not too bad!"
1,dead after 5 months,"Worked fine for 5 months, then nothing. Batteries are fine. Since it is still under warranty, I will contact panasonic for replacement."
3,ANGRY customer...,"I was excited to get this item. When I open the box, everything seemed fine.Until I used it and it wasnt cutting any hair. I looked closer and saw that the inner blade never came with the item!!! what kind of customer service is this."
3,"Not best, not worse",I have owned better but this one isn't all that bad. Does an adequate job of getting the hair.
1,"Horrible, Useless Overated JUNK",Do not get this; it's a COMPLETE waste of money as it DOES NOT TRIM nose/facial hair AT ALL.It's amazing to see the number of 4 & 5 star ratings for this Panasonic ER430K. I would have it 0 (Zero) stars if I could.
5,Does the job.,I can't say much more than it does what it is supposed to do. Have no idea how long it will last but I am completely satisfied with it.
4,Hubby likes it1!,"This purchase was for my hubby, he seems to like it so far so good. He's not making weird nose hair sniffing noses so I'm excited that he's pleased."
2,it did the job for awhile.,"it worked for a awhile, and then became history,which really amazed me, since the brand sells itself, to be honest a bought it led by the brand."
3,Excelente producto,"Un producto que no puede faltar para los hombres, excelente funcionamiento, no me gusto el sistema de aspiración, la verdad, no percibo que aspire los vellos que corta, no me parece efectivo, pero la maquina corta muy bien el vello, hace poco ruido y es muy fácil de manejar."
2,Older one worked better,"I bought two of these, one for me and one for my spouse. I paid more than the current price.Both of us think this trimmer does a poor job compared to our old, less expensive Panasonic trimmers. It takes too long to do even a small clean up job because it does not seem to cut well nor fast enough. I suppose the vacuum is nice, but we never had an issue without one so I am junking these and replacing them with the simpler model like we had before."
2,Older model is better,The older model 421 is better. This model does not trim was well as the older model. I lost the older model and purchased this model. I am disappointed. I will reorder to purchase the older model.
4,Great Quality Trimmer,This was a very good buy for me. It works really well. The thingon the bottom is sorta hard to take off but it does come off. Thatis where you have to put the battery. 4/5 Starrs from me.
4,Works well but leaves lots of sharp little hairs,"This is the first ear/nose hair trimmer I have ever used, so I have nothing to compare it to. The unit feels substantial and well made. The battery cover comes off in a 1/4 turn and appears watertight. The blade end easily disassembles for cleaning, although there is a thin plastic ""stick"" that seems a bit frail and if it fails I sure the whole thing would die.As far as results go, it certainly cuts hairs. It actually tickles a little in your nose and is loud in your ear. In your nose the hairs are left very short and prickley. I found this to be an uncomfortable feeling for the first 24 hours, but then got used to it.It does what it is supposed to do, although it is very loud when used in your ear."
5,My nose has never been cleaner!,"I've tried trimmers in the past and they never worked for me, so I just used a pair of cuticle scissors instead. I lost those scissors so I went on Amazon and found this. I got it yesterday and stuck it up my nose and voila. It got everything from the deep hairs inside to the bushy stuff under the tip of the nose. Easy. No discomfort. Couldn't ask for more."
5,"Good ""man-scaping"" equipment!","I have used this unit several times since purchase. I agree with some of the other reviews who question the vacuum effectiveness but the trimmer certainly does the job without tugging, ripping or pulling. Good ""man-scaping"" equipment!"
5,The best trimmer on the market,This is a great product. The blades spin at top speed without fail. Something cheaper knockoffs don't do. It doesn't bog down while trimming. It doesn't gouge the skin or pull/rip the hair out. The vacuum feature works better than I expected. Great product. Make sure you buy it from Amazon and not a partner. My first purchase was from a partner who shipped the wrong product. (One of the cheaper models) Amazon however was great about the return and made the process as painless as possible.
3,Works well for a year,"The product worked great initially but after about a year it was doing alright possible because the blades started becoming blunt. Now after a year and 4 months it has stopped working completely. For the $20 that I paid, I expected the product to last longer."
4,Great trimmer,"This is the first one I have owned and it works great. It is much better than using scissors for trimming. It is quick, quiet and painless. The vacuum feature is nice, no hair to clean up. Panasonic quality is nice."
1,Not a good buy,"After reading the reviews, I purchased the Panasonic ER430K to replace a Wahl trimmer that was ten or more years older. When I got the Panasonic trimmer, I threw the old one in the trash thinking that I had a much better trimmer! But I was wrong and I ended up digging the old Wahl trimmer out of the trash because the Panasonic trimmer was worthless. Maybe it is the way my nose hairs are, but the ER430K did not seem work for me. Glad I didn't empty the trash right away!"
1,I don't get these reviews,"I don't understand these positive reviews. This thing doesn't do anything in terms of cutting. I have tried every angle, cleaning it, ect... and it doesn't cut any hair. My remington broke and I thought this was an upgrade but I guess not."
4,Husband loves it....and so do I,"So I bought this trimmer for my husband (OK, and maybe for me since his nose hairs really don't bother him) and he is pretty impressed with it. Especially the sucking action that takes care of the clippings. He says its easy to use and really powerful. Buy it -- you and your wife will love it!"
4,Good one,the product is really worthy and works as expected.. Nice . I would recommend this to my friends ...
2,Panasonic ER430K Vacuum Nose/Ear Hair Trimmer,"This basically functions, but the cutting heads on it are not near as good as my old Panasonic ER411. (No letters after it, just ER411) The ER411 has the best cutting heads on it of any nose trimmer I have ever had. Fortunately the head on my old one fits on this new one. By switching the head I was able to make a good trimmer out of this new one. The old head on my ER411 has not worn out yet. Unfortunately I can not find the ER411 anymore anywhere. I liked the idea of this new one having the fan on it. That seems to work fine, but don't expect this one to cut really well. Maybe if I had not had my old one to compare it to this new one wouldn't have seemed so weak. They need to make one with a fan, but with the cutting head of the old ER411."
5,Does the Job,I have used other type of trimmers and this one is the best. It is not as noisy as others and is very easy to use.
5,Just what I needed,"This works great. I should have gotten this a long time ago but was afraid that it would be a flimsy toy that wouldn't work well or it would cause pain by pulling hair. Actually, it works precisely as advertised and does a good job."
4,Panasonic Trimmer,This trimmer is great! Safely cuts the hairs close without pulling. You can actually feel the vacuum working. Very easy to keep cleaning by rinsing with water.
2,Great until........,"Product worked as specified for the first four months. Then top piece under the blade broke or sounds broken. Reliability is in questions, would have hoped to get a year or two out of it."
4,my first trimmer!,"Well this is my first ""nose hair"" trimmer ever. I'm glad that i purchased it. Though i hate that i actually need it. This particular model works ok. I dont know if other models have more than two cutting blades but this one could use four or five. It seems as though this would help out. With out the extra blades, and the fact that the two rotating blades that it does have sit pretty far down into the device - it seems as though this unit requires a lot of manual manipulation once inside your nose ""in and out then turn the unit, in and out then turn again"". Don't know if this is normal because this is my first unit. The vacuum feature is definitely a plus. Beware when you are rinsing out the head of nose hair clippings. The tiny actuator parts that are non steel have a tendency to want to float right out of the head and right down your sink drain! Other than that it will do the job with a little of your effort."
3,Not as close as I would like,This product looks good and the vacuum is a nice feature. I don't like the blade setup and I wish it would cut easier and closer. This product functions okay but not as well as I was looking for. I don't know if there are better blade designs out there but it would be worth looking into before buying.
4,Quick Shipment,So far the product works fine. It does not catch at all after 4 uses. The product was shipped quickly.
3,It seems to do the job.,Don't know yet how effective it is in actually keeping the cut off hairs from getting into the ear canal. Purchased it at the direction of a hearing professional. Seem it bit difficult to clean but do not know for sure what to expect.
4,Best Trimmer I've Ever Had.,"Having said that, it still doesn't quite get all those pesky little hairs in my nose, but it does a better job than the other two disappointing trimmers I've used in the past. Hair removal is painless and fast. You can use the Panasonic ER430K Vacuum Nose/Facial Hair Trimmer to shape your eyebrows, too! So far, I really like it!"
4,Nice little trimmer,This is my first trimmer so I don't have much to compare it to but it does the job. I sometimes have trouble getting a hair or two from my nose though. Not too bad.
5,great,"Works perfect. Great quality, as advertised. Wish it was recharagable rather than AA-battery operated but I guess I cant get everything I want :("
5,Now we look for things to trim!,"I never believed that this little trimmer could do so much, and be so comfortable and quick. For trimming eyebrows and loose hair around the face, it is definitely a winner. My husband has used many different trimmers in the past, with most grabbing the hair and yanking it out (!), or ignoring the hair totally. Now, his nose and ear hairs are cleanly and easily trimmed just the way he likes them. The best we've ever seen, and now we've stopped looking! Good for Amazon for providing such quality products!"
2,Vibrates way too much,This thing vibrates way too much. It is impossible for me to put it in my nose without extreme irritation. Very annoying.
3,Not much better than the other models,"This product is ok, but did not live up to the positive reviews I read prior to purchasing. I do like the way it traps hair after cutting, but it does no better than any other model I've tried at trimming hair."
1,Used for about 15 seconds before it cut the inside of my nose,"Due to the decent reviews, I gave the Panasonic ER430K trimmer a try. It does not come with the required AA battery, so I loaded it up and gave it a go. This trimmer will tickle initially... until it catches your skin and you end up with a bloody nose. I can't tell if the blade made contact with the skin, or if the spinning motion of the ill-conceived blade design pulled the hair rather than cut it. Since I am not willing to risk further injury to find out, I'll just strongly recommend you look elsewhere for a trimming device."
1,cuts very poorly,I find that this trimmer barely cuts nose or ear hair. It is so ineffective as to be useless.In 2005 I bought the previous model (ER411NC Nose and Ear Hair Groomer) from Amazon -- and it was MUCH better.
1,Broke after 1 use.,Don't waste your money. Keep looking for another product. This product broke after the first use. This is a total waste.
3,Product does the job reasonably well,"I bought this to replace a previous nose clipper. That one was better, but this one does the job albeit not as well."
2,disappointing,My husband is very disappointed with this trimmer. Not as powerful as the one I bought at $1.00 store.
4,Good Product,Very good product. I will buy again. Very well packaged. For sure will recommend the vendor. I was a little awared of the quality of this product but i am very happy with it.
4,Good Product,It arrived quickly. I have used it several times and it works flawlessly. Very good product. I definitely recommend it.
4,nose hair trimmer Panasonic,"only the second one I have owned, but by far the best. Cleans itself, quiet running, absolutely no pain, no hair pulling. Sharp blades, but it is new. Do not know yet about battery life."
3,OK,"I lost my great Sharper Image nosetrimmer which had cost me $35 or so a couple of years ago. I bought this one to replace it and compared to the Shaper Image one, it is OK. It makes a racket during its use - so using it to remove ear hairs is a challenge."
5,Best trimmer EVER!,I am very impressed with this trimmer. It has a special guard on it so it is impossible to pinch while trimming. The vacuum action is totally cool! It is so nice not having a million little hairs left in my ears and nose after trimming! It has a very high quality feel in your hand but that's no surprise since it's a Panasonic.
2,Trash after 20 months,"Wouldn't buy again. After 15 months started pulling on hairs, making my eyes water. I found out Panasonic does not make replacement parts so it's a throwaway now. I'll get a cheaper throwaway or a more expensive item that has replacement blades."
1,Panasonic vacuum trimmer,"A disappointing replacement of an earlier excellent product. It is bulky, cumbersome and weighs about twice what my first trimmer weighed. The cutting blade doesn't work anywhere near as well. I cannot recommend this to anyone."
3,fine,"It is OK considering the price. But not that effective, it is just OK. Whenever I use it, I just want to sneeze. I dont know why."
3,nose hair magic,"This is a wonderful product, I do not know how I ever survived without it! I also recommend this for trimming those inconvenient butt hairs too!"
1,worked well... lasted 2 months,"nice looking product, well priced. it worked well, but felt just as cheap as any other plastic, battery-operated nose/ear hair trimmer out there. two months later, out of the blue, just stopped working. never was dropped or mishandled, it wasn't even used all that often... just died. i have tried numerous products that all feel the same, they all seem to be cheaply made. going to give the philips norelco product a try now, but this will be the last time i purchase a battery operated one, if it dies, i am moving to a hand operated one, or just go back to using a razor... can't be spending 15 bucks every few months for crappy products anymore."
3,Model ER401 cuts better. Why do they have to make changes??,"I think the older (Top rated model ER401) did a better job. Here is why: Panasonic not only changed the body (for the better) but the also changed the blade cutting angle. Luckily, I save the old cutting head from the ER401. They seem to be interchangeable, except the new tip is slighly longer, which means that you have to change the entire head. Just changing the new blade with the old works, but is slightly nosier. Why do they have to change something that already works very well?"
4,Works Like a Charm,"Excellent little trimmer that does just what you want it do. Painless trimming, cuts close and runs relatively quietly. Motor feels like it's plenty powerful for the job at hand. Uses a single AA battery. I use rechargeable batteries so I don't care how good battery life is. The vacuum thing seems to work well enough.Comes with a deluxe, black-velvet carrying case. Yes, you read that correctly, black velvet (oooooooooo... aaaaaaaaahhh...). The carrying case is very soft and feels good when rubbed on your cheek."
3,Kinda disappointed...,"The Panasonic ER430K was highly rated, so I assumed that it was considerably better at trimming nose hair (my primary need). I was wrong. I have a non-name brand trimmer which was identical-looking at the business end, just a slim body to house a AA battery and no vacuum. The rotary trimmer inside did just as good a job as the Panasonic and only cost about $9. What I would have wanted to know before buying this item would have been information that would have described WHY this product was so much better and how that had been determined. I expected a more sophisticated, well-engineered trimmer, but sadly, didn't get it. I'd STILL like to know how reviewers of this product gave it such a high rating over other trimmers."
1,Does not cut hair. Old model worked great.,"As others have said the old Panasonic trimmers worked great. This doesn't. In fact it doesn't cut nose or ear hair at all. Ponderous. You can hear the motor spinning but, as others have alluded to, the design has changed (?for legal reasons?) and nothing is cut. Another reason for tort reform as if any more were needed in our litiginous society. When the previous one cut/pulled the hair and pinched a bit you knew it was working. What kind of people sue Panasonic for that? How much can you really hurt yourself with a trimmer? I would like to give no stars."
3,Returned this item. Why is it the size of a Buick Skylark?,When I opened the box I thought I was shipped a 65 Buick Skylark. Which is like really big for a nose hair trimmer so I returned it. The problem was it had this 60s car fin shape. So it really did look like an old Buick. I didn't want to dedicate so much medicine cabinet or suitcase space to a trimmer so back it goes. I would recommend buyers look into a combo beard trimmer with a nose ear hair trimmer function. From the other reviews I assume it would function well but it was almost insanely large. I can't believe I have expended this much energy on buying a nose hair trimmer.
1,Ineffective - complete waste of money,I generally don't take the time to write reviews. But this product is so bad that I took the time to review it. The nose hair trimmer is very ineffective. All it does is tickle my nose and trim a few small pieces of hair. A replaced this with a $10 nose trimmer I saw in CVS. That's much faster and more effective than this one. This product is a complete waste of money - do not buy.
2,Doesn't Cut Very Well,"I've had this for a couple of years. It spins reliably, is good on batteries, but simply does not get all the hair, I feel like I'm ironing, over and over, and it still leaves some behind."
1,doesn't work well at all. It's quite b/c it doesn't do much!,find something else. It's quite but if it doesn't do what you're paying for it to do then what's the point?!Forget this item and move on.
2,lost,"I haven't recieved till now, and I've checked and check with my leasingroom stuff, I think it's been lost, would you please resend it? thanks"
4,"Works great, but not too durable","I bought this Trimmer in 11/2010. After 1 year and 3 months of occasional use, it has stopped working. When it was working, it did a great job. Trims hair quickly and with no pulling at all. Overall, I'm still satisfied with the product and plan to purchase another one."
5,Nose hair trimmer,Great product. No itching or sneezing while using this. Best one I've used so far. I highly recommend to anyone seeking a good efficient trimmer.
4,Very good,The panasonic nose trimmer did a great job as they indicated. I hate getting old and having hair grow where you don't want it but this product did do a good job and was very easy to use.
4,Maintains the Panasonic reputation for fine products.,"This trimmer is as good a trimmer as one would find anywhere. The onlydownside is that it cannot come in to skin close. For that, a hand held scissoror shaving blade is required."
3,it's ok,"It's ok , nothing special about this productI dont think the vacuum was powerful as i thought it would be"
4,Functional trimmer,"The trimmer seems to cut hair in my nose and ears. It takes more effort than I think it should, but that may be due to my not knowing how to get the most out of the product. I don't think there are classes on the subject and there may not be a need for them, but I could use some direction."
3,good trimmer,"It is a good trimmer with an accepted price.I feel that the battery does not last for a long time.I like the included bagRegards,Rodi"
2,Ouch!!!!!,"This trimmer worked great at first. I used it several times with no issues. I like everything about is and it seems to have very good power. It claims that you can get those hard to reach places without cutting yourself... That was not the case for me, I cut the crap out of my nose and it hurt like hell. It could be the way the inside of my nose is formed I am not sure. Just take this review for what it is worth and be careful."
5,So far so good.,This might be an early review. I recently get this one from Amazon.com. I like it. Much better than the ones I have had before.
4,Ok Product,I've been through quite a number of these. So far this Panasonic is working well. The price was good. Time will tell if this is the ONE.
5,The best,"Easy,efficient, and less than a minute. So much less nose hair left in nostril. I fully recommend this."
1,Stopped working after 6 months,This nose trimmer stopped working after about 6 months of use. I would use it about once every two weeks so I didn't overuse this thing. I changed the battery and still nothing. This was a waste of money.
3,Adequate but nothing to write home about....,I bought this trimmer after my old cheapie Wahl unit died. I am not overly impressed. The unit does at best an adequate job of trimming. It really falls down on closeness of the trim and ease of getting at all the offending nose hairs. My old Wahl unit excelled on all counts except occasionally pulling a hair. Unfortunately the Wahl unit isn't made anymore. The vacuum feature of this unit is a nice idea but I didn't perceive any particular benefit.
3,Not that powerful,"This trimmer is...OK. It would work better if it were more powerful. Plus, it really doesn't trim the hair close enough. I don't want to have to wait until the hairs are 1/2 or even 1/4 inch long before the trimmer decides to cut them. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it."
3,"Looks pretty, not much difference from our old one","We've had this since Dec. 2009. I had great expectations, but the performance is not that much better than our $8 cheapo. It still doesn't catch the hairs without a lot of manipulation and effort."
5,Great trimmer,This inexpensive trimmer is easy to use and clean. It trims as well as it claims to do. It's a good value for the money and highly recommend this product.
2,"Overpriced, and imperfect.","I bought these for my girlfriend and being fairly new at buying jewelry I made a few mistakes, 14mm was alot bigger than I imagined, and these hardly resemble pearls. They were also a bit tattered and had minor scratches. Luckily my girlfriend has alot of hair so they worked for her but short haired girls or straight haired should probably pass on these"
2,Not worth the money....,"These earrings were quite pricey for being ""simulated"" pearls. They were also a darker shade of champagne than what I expected them to be. I purchased these to wear to a wedding and now that I've seen them, I'm not sure that I'll even wear them. I was looking for something that appears ""classy"" but these appear somewhat ""gawdy"". I'm not impressed at all."
5,SO chic,"These are lovely, elegant and light to wear. I felt quite chic wearing them. They go with everything."
1,Disappointed,"The cutting edge was average. However the reduced shank size (3/8"" on a 5/8"" bit) could not handle the load. On just my second weekend of use, the shank bent and destroyed the chuck on my drill. I replaced the drill with a better model that has a 1/2"" chuck, but I am skeptical about getting more Dewalt bits."
5,Max at his funniest,"My grandchildren and I love Max & Ruby stories. Ms. Wells is very clever in the way she illustrates the characters so that the reader can actually see Max thinking about how to not have to eat the egg. If your children haven't met Max yet, then this is definitely a book for an infant or young toddler, but children who have met Max love to go back and ""read"" the early boardbacks on their own. It's like visiting a familiar friend."
1,What a disappointment!,"After purchasing ""Goodnight Max"" and LOVING IT, I made a big mistake by purchasing this and one other ""Max"" book. Unimaginative and complicated, this is not a book that could hold my attention ,let alone my 1-year-old's."
5,"Wow, it really does work",I was a little skeptical about the case feeder working as well as it should; turns out it really works. I highly recommend adding this to your LNL press if you want to handle your brass less and speed up the reloading process.
5,Good Book,This book has been extremly helpful. Recommend to all who have or plan on having Tarantulas.
5,Great book,"I purchased this book at a local pet shop. I own quite a few books on owning tarantulas, and believe this one by far is the most informative. Whether you're thinking about getting your first tarantula and want to know the basics or you're an experienced keeper like me and you just want to further expand your knowledge, this is a great book. This book is filled with beautiful full-color photos, and has a very useful ""species accounts"" chapter that tells you about individual species - temperament, housing requirements, etc. from the commonly available species to the more exotic, hard to find species. It's so important to do your research, you want to have happy, healthy pets, and also be able to enjoy them at their fullest."
1,This is the worst thing I've ever heard of,I agree with one of the other reveiws how could such an awful band rematch a legendary song and make sond like a gorilla i a choke coller sung it it is unthinkable who do these people think they are no band should ever remake such an amazing clssic certainly not Limp Bizkit.I can't believe it!!!!
1,Nightmare on Elmstreet,Ahhhhh............. this.... this... freddy kruger is the monster who I keep hearing his voice against my ears. Shut shut up! Your attempt in this song is no better than any other band doing a WHO tribute in my local RSL club.
3,This Human Skull is not for kids!,"Purchising this toy for me, a 16 year old, was somthing that I thought would be a piece of cake to construct, after all, the toy's recommended age group was 10 years old and up. To my surprise, however, the unclear instructions and the confusing assembly confounded me. The skull was very confusing to assemble, and NOT suitable for a child 10 years old. It is a great model, and does provide a great challenge, but for someone older. An older person would accept and embrace the challenge, and so they would appreciate it more than a child would."
5,Very enlightening - greatly increased my understanding of events!,"Seven generations ago, my ancestor Avery Mustain served in the Revolutionary War...his military service ended in 1781.Avery was present at the Siege of Yorktown. I have to wonder if he was aware of George Washington's presence or the greatness of this event after his involvement in many battle campaigns over several years. Avery was 20 when he volunteered (born in 1756 and began military duty in 1776).He was ordered to assist in marching the British prisoners to Noland's Ferry after the siege.Diligent researchers before me had uncovered his request for pension statement and an image of his gravestone.This book was very helpful to me in understanding not only the well footnoted events, but how these events might affect the daily lives, actions and feelings of colonists. I highly recommend this as a source that brings history to life."
5,A great way to history.,"Although fiction, there is enough history to bring the story to life and to encourage more investigation into the life and times of colonial america."
1,Deserves 0 stars,I am amazed at the people who gave this mirror so many stars. It is just terrible. The light on it just glares out but doesn't provide any illumination so you can see your face. Order at your own risk.
2,Does not magnify much.,"I was replacing my current mirror of several years with the exact match in name and magnification, but this mirror does not magnify anything like the old one. I have eye problems and will be unable to use it. Found a 15X mirror by the same company that magnifies like my old one, but it is so much bigger to handle."
1,Painful experience: FH NJ,"I received a wrong mirror from this vendor "" X7"" insteade of ""X5"" ,It was plurryand hurt the eyes looking at it. when I returned the mirror the vendor deducted $15.00 dollars out of the money that owed to me and was very rude and nasty. I had to file a claim with Amazon. Please be aware and don't buy from that vendor. Sorry to give one star, He doesn't deserve any;"
2,too small,This mirror is much smaller than what I was interested in. The magnification is great but the mirror is too small.
2,Stellar Toy Not So Spectacular,"I ordered this item with the hopes of creating a fun bedtime environment for my 2-year-old, thinking that the display of stars on her bedroom ceiling would be spectacular. Instead, I was disappointed that this toy achieved nothing more than I could have produced with black construction paper, a hole puncher, and a flashlight.The base does not rotate, so the ""stars"" (which are merely small circles of light) only cover a small portion of the surface onto which they are projected. Overall, I was disappointed that this toy did not meet the expectations which motivated its purchase. Maybe it would be more purposeful in another situation - for example, a school project to simply learn more about constellations and how to identify them.Even though I was disappointed with my purchase, I would not necessarily say that the item does not meet its item description - it just simply does not produce a spectacular ""planetarium-like"" display and is not worth the price of $29.99."
2,Disappointed,I had a product similar to this when I was a kid and wanted something I could show in a controlled environment. I thought it would be better and was excited when it arrived. The light seemed bright enough for me and the machine seems durable but the projection itself is not great. The stars show up as large dots on the ceiling until you get it a couple feet from the ceiling. I tried to pick out some easy constellations such as the big dipper but couldn't even make it out at all among the dots. I wouldn't recommend this product if you want a good educational tool to teach about the stars.
3,Looks good,"I suggest if you're looking for a home plantarium get this one..it's the best you can get.Like above mentioned this displays a white light until other trashy projectors i.e Star Theatre II = a total waste of time and $35US and they display in shadowy dull and doesn't even fill the entire room...a total waste.Get this one,you won't regret it!"
3,My grandson really likes this toy,"I gave this to my 11 year old grandson for his birthday. He is thrilled that he can see all the stars on his ceiling. However, I am disappointed in the focus. He cannot see the stars clearly."
1,Not very accurate,I was dissappointed with the product because the stars projected are all the same size and look like a dot. Part of learning to identify constellations is how the different stars appear grouped together in their pattern. How can you distinguish anything if all the dots are the same? I don't understand going to the trouble of making the product so specific if the projection fails.
3,star projector,this was nice as a night light however it was not realistic like a real planetarium but OK for young kids night light didnt like the fact it was battery operated but nice gift for boys or girls to light up room at night
3,Disappointed,"I returned this item. It is sturdy and useful as indoor entertainment, but I wanted my grandchild to be able to identify the constellations outside and the dots just didn't seem to translate to the actual sky."
2,Not working,I bought this as a christmas gift for my daughter. When we opened it and put it together the light did not work. So it sits up in the closet unable to be used.
1,Up in the sky-look!-nothing.,"I was excited to receive this so quickly from the seller, as it is a Christmas present for a friend far away. I took it out of the box, intending to make sure it worked, after reading other reviews. Didn't work. I bought brand new 'Duracell' C batteries, not a knockoff brand, and tried every type of combination of ideas to make this work.I am quite disappointed, more so because it is a Christmas gift.I will send it back, but as one reviewer said, now I have to look for another planetarium gift.Whoever gets one that works won the the Space Theater lottery."
3,neat stars,"this is really fun at night, I thought that it would rotate but it doesnt. We still have a blast with it"
5,"I hactually don't know if it works, I gave it to my dad for Father's day.","My dad used to dake us kids outside at night to look at the stars and constellations. I thought this might be a good Father's day gift. I don't know how well it works, but he really seemed to like getting it."
5,Dr. Joe's Rx for Managing Your Health,"This is an excellent book, an easy, and quick read. I highly recommend this book. Dr Joe's practice is in California."
3,"Nice Gun, but...","I loaded this with one of the loaders. I couldn't figure out why the mag wouldn't fit. Turns out, the mag accepts way more bb's than it can hold. Once I figured that out, it was good. It is fun to shoot and seems to shoot straight. Maybe shoots a bit higher than you aim, but it's easy to adjust for that. Has a lot of metal, so feels very sturdy. You can see the BB's, but they do go very fast."
3,gun,"this gun worked fine for a while, but the fact that its plastic really bummed out. The magazine ammo feed is also really inefficient. for its price, this is a good, strong accurate gun. But dont expect to use this for longer than a few months xP"
2,"Unfortunately, Kamal is Not Funny without his companion","I am a huge fan of the Jerky Boys and loved what Kamal did as a part of that duo. Unfortunately, Kamal's prank calls this time around are mostly sub-par and not worth listening to more than once. However, the reason why this CD is worth buying is for the 4 unlisted prank calls performed by an uncredited caller. These ""hidden"" calls are among some of the best prank calls I have heard... ever. So if this intrigues you, try to track down a copy of this CD."
1,Kamal's So-Low Stuff,"Bad, bad, bad. This proves that Johnny B. is the (only) talent behind the Jerky Boys. The guy even has skits! ""X-rated Hotel"" is great but has been on the bootleg tapes for over a decade. And what's up with the four calls not listed on the CD? Who is that guy? (He's pretty good). Kamal's sinking, faster, faster..."
3,Poorly Made Boundary,"The boundary isn't made that well. The corner rings that are used to keep the boundary square are split, and when pulling the boundary taught the rings come apart. The boundary itself is ok, with plastic connectors that allow correct sizing, but ideally there should be some markings on the boundary to help with this. You have to break out a long tape measure to help in this regard. Squaring up the court is another story, and again a tape measure is your only recourse.For a simple boundary it suffices, but if you are looking for something with more substance look elsewhere as this doesn't deliver."
2,Adjustable lines,"At first, it looked great. But the plastic stakes to anchor the corners are weak and will break after a few uses (I had to replace with metal ones from hardware store). There are no simple ways to adjust lines to ""short courts"" (need measuring tape and sharpie). And the surplus line from the short court adjustment left a ""tail"" ribboning either on the court or tangling with the actual boundary line (I had to modify with 2 sliding buckles from the shoulder strap of 2 old beach bags). Finally, there is nothing included to correctly wrap up the lines (had to purchase one at local hardware store). But the initial price is still acceptable for the blue 1"" lines."
2,not very good,1. It is just 2 pieces instead of 4 or more making it very difficult to roll up. Easily getting entangled.2. The spikes are of very low quality. Broke within two days of using them in sand.
4,Works well,"This worked well enough for our needs (beach volleyball league). I ordered three sets and a few of the spikes have been broken (best to use a mallot to hammer them in and not your foot). To wrap them up and store them I recommend buying an electrical cord wrap at the hardware store for less than a buck each. It doesn't come with anything like this, like some others do.One court boundary consists of two lengths of webbing that clip together in the middle (under the net), so it's pretty easy to set up without measuring tape, in my opinion."
4,A big addition to sand volleyball,"We picked this up to settle a lot of close calls arising during our games on a sand court. It works fine, but it was annoying upon receiving it to find that it had been manufactured incorrectly so I had to return it. Of course, Amazon's great so they're in the process of a refund since a replacement was unavailable."
2,Xantrex Power Inverter,Will have to return it as it makes a lot of noise and popping sounds like it is about to fail. Am afraid to use it.
5,Great way to charge things on the road,"This thing is great. I used it to charge my laptop during my driving tour of D.C and Virginia. The fan noise is pretty low. When the music was on, it was very hard to hear the fan. Now I do not need carry different car chargers for different electronics any more."
4,inverter - great little gadget,I love gadgets! and this fits in with my lifestlye - RVing and being on the road.It is great for running my laptop or charging my cell phone from the car!
3,Not enough power for me,"I bought this after reading the reviews that said it was fine for powering a laptop. While that is true, for my Macbook Pro it won't power it when the laptop battery needs to charge. Since that's not always something you can plan for, it's basically useless for laptops.I ended up buying the Xantrex 400W inverter, which is plenty of power for charging the laptop battery from the cigarette lighter.As for the performance of the unit in general, it was fine, and the fan noise is nothing to be concerned about. Once the car is moving, you won't be able to hear it."
1,"High price,","Why is this about three times the price? I can get it at the local store for $8:99!Works great if you don't overload it, it can run anything under 150 watts."
3,"Works, not for what I wanted","Works great, I'm keeping it in my car to charge my computer and phone while driving. I wanted to hook it up to a solar panel, but it drew too much energy and I couldn't charge anything up off of it. Slightly disappointed there."
1,Buy at your own risk!,I can't say about the durability because I can't get it to make anything work. I have tried using the suction machine with it~no power. It whirs and the little fan runs but what I needed it for didn't work. It might run a laptop or a video~I don't know I haven't tried that cause that wasn't what I bought it for. It is just layin in my back seat and I figure when I have my next yardsale it will be in it. But I'll have to make sure they try it on what they want to power first~cause I sure ain't giving them no guarantee.
5,Nice and Convienient,"So far, This has been a wonderful product, it is nice and compact, and keeps the laptop running on long car trips, which we take often."
4,"Well made, plenty of power, a little noisy","I have not tried it with a draw near its max of 175W but at lower draws it is fine and always runs cool, thanks to the built in fan. That is also the only negative I have after a month with the unit -- fan noise. It is loud enough to be noticeable over normal road noise, although the car radio drowns it out at normal volume. I think I can put up with the fan because otherwise it seems a very good unit. Maybe they could hook the fan to a sensor and only have it run when the unit gets hot. The shape is good for my pickup's dash arrangement and being all-in-one it doesn't slide around or need securing. Overall, a good unit that has done the job."
3,What's that strange noise honey?,"The inverter works as adverstised and powers my laptop adequately while driving. The only drawback is that the build-in fan is very noisy, so be forewarned."
3,It does what it says,The inverter does exactly what it promised to do but it is very loud. I kept thinking my car window was open and I was hearing road noise.
3,A question of quality,"The product works as advertised. However, it occasionally emits a high pitched sound which I identified as a hardware issue with the mini fan which resides in the unit. Something is loose: either the case that holds the unit together or the mini fan inside. After I fumble around with the unit for a minute I get the sound to go away. But it's annoying to have to do this. I have only used the unit a few times so far. Perhaps the noise will go away entirely...or it might come back and never go away. So I remain concerned. When the unit isn't hissing at me, it's great."
1,won't charge macbook pro laptop,"macbook pro laptop wouldn't charge in car. charging light on cord magnetic attachment glowed green, never turned amber to indicate charging. also inverter made buzzing noise. maybe I got a defective unit."
2,Not so good Xantrex product,"A good price is just not good enough if it doesnt last. The transformer thinngy had broken loose from the circuit board for some reason. YOu can hear it rattle around. I dont suggest that you buy this product. This item is poorly put together. It failed after using it occasionally for 5 months. When I took it apart to look inside, it didnt look like it was made very well."
4,So Far So Good,"I bought the Micro Inverter for occasional use with my laptop while on the road to avoid the problem of running out of battery power. So far so good, it works pretty well and the complaint of it's fan being noisy which I read from other reviews hasn't really bothered me. It certainly seems a handy tool and can be recommended for anyone with similar needs."
4,Useful,I bought this product to safe money in car charger. The only disavantage is that this product is a little noisy.
5,Roadtrip Savior,"I was planning a road trip from CT to Pittsburgh, PA and I knew that I would need to stop occasionally and check my emails or just putter away online to regain my sanity from the long, boring road. So I looked on Amazon and chanced upon this lovely DC/AC adapter. It really helped out and allowed me to check up on the internet from the comfort of my car. I didn't need to stop in at a Starbuck's or questionable gas station to power up, so I was very happy.Obviously, this is not a modem, I had a tethered cellphone that provided me that service, but without power to my laptop, that would not have done me any good."
5,It works great,I took the inverter along for a family road trip and it works as advertised. I was able to power my laptop with no problem.
1,Durability POOR,This item is poorly constructed. It failed after using it occasionally for one year. Dissasembly of the failed inverter shows very poor construction techniques. The transformer had broken loose from the circuit board because the manufacturer depended upon very thin wires to hold this heavy component in place. RECOMMENDATION: DONT BUY
1,"Beware, Burned the Fuse in my Late Model Vehicle","Like a lot of folks, you assume the best when a product is as highly rated as this one. My wife was thrilled to be able to surf the web while I drove on a recent road trip.She was on her 13"" Macbook and plugged into the power outlet of a 2009 Audi Q5. Everything worked great for maybe 5 minutes. Not sure what caused it to happen suddenly, but we notice she's not getting power anymore and all of the power outlets in the car won't work. I can only assume it was drawing too much power.I'd still love to be able to power our Macs in the car if anyone has a suggestion."
5,A Gift!!,"""Beginning From The End"" is a glorious book! I went on a suggestion from Kenneth Wood to read this book and I am very glad I listened. This book has become a revolving servant of my midnight restlessness-offering me pleasure to accompany my insomnia! The words wandering through these pages capture the reader with a seduction unrivaled by most modern and classic poets, a welcomed seduction.Unlike many poets whom write in a manner to be not-so-obvious with their meanings, the poems in ""Beginning From The End"" encourage the reader to delve into their hearts and minds for that element of discovery, whereas many poets seem to keep it so personal and inward that it's a turn off and not worth the effort to find true meaning within the pages.I am very grateful that this author was brought into my world, I feel privileged to find to have found another great poet!Pen on, my friend, pen on..."
2,lame,"over dramatic, predictable, cheesey. pretty much just an hour and a half of a guy preaching lessons. acting was terrible. i chose the wrong movie to watch on a boring friday night."
2,Not Effective,"I tried this for 3 months and noticed no difference in my CM. The only possible effect I noticed was spotting just before my period, which is not normal for me. I've had better luck with Royal Jelly."
2,Yuck!,"Is it supposed to smell very strongly of sulfur/rotten eggs and leave the same cloying taste at the back of your throat? I would think the answer to that is no, considering I purchased this before from Kurkel Enterprises and did not have the same issue.I loved the ""baby dust"", but it doesn't quite make up for the suspected rancidness of the product. The last time I ordered, it definitely ""did it's job"" and lived up to all the claims, increased libido, increased fertile-type cervial mucus and so on. I guess we'll see about this batch....kinda disappointed here ""Baby Hopes""!"
3,still on it,The shipment arrived very quickly and I was pleased with that. I'm almost through using one bottle (taking it with lots of water) and haven't seen any improvement in quantity and quality of CM. I'm still using though it cos I feel maybe it'll take a while to kick in...guess everyone's different.
2,I can not say much but...,I can not say whether it has worked or not. I have only had it for 2 weeks. I have NOT had an upset stomach or any physical change that is alarming. However I can say that is has a very strong stinky smell. I put the pill s in an empty medicine bottle to see if that made a difference in the smell and it did not. I will give it a full month to see if I have any type of changes. I will remain very hopeful till then. I also bought the FertilAid and I will see how that goes (that bottle does not have a smell at all).Best wishes to all!!
2,Not a Miracle Product,"As an actual customer, don't purchase this product and expect to have quality CM within 30 days. With supplements such as this product it seems as if you have to take this product for several months before you actually see any results IF ANY. I took this product because clomid causes hostile CM and I needed a supplement. As a caveat I will say that everyone has a different body subject to various levels of sensitivity, so if you have the patience I guess it may be worth the try. However, I would recommend using Mucinex(the regular one) or Robittussin as a starter or perhaps pre-seed as a lubricant before paying $20 a pop for something that you need to use consistently for a long period of time. Lastly, the tablets stink horribly."
4,just made my order.,"I have debated ordering this product for a couple of weeks. But after much reading, I finally decided to give it a go. My husband and I have been ttc for at least a year, and I have never had EWCM, but hopefully once I recieve my package, I hope that will finally happen. baby dust to everyone!"
5,Allergic,I bought these for my wife since we are trying to get pregnant. She is allergic to something in the pills and breaks out in an itchy rash all over. She has stopped taking them and the rash is gone. I continue to take FirtilAid for Men and the doctor has noticed an increase in my count. I'll keep taking them.
4,wow,"seems to work pretty fast, forces me to drink tons of water...wish I didnt have to take it 3 times a day though..."
1,Dont Waste Your Money,This Product did absolutly nothing for me...No CM at all if anything I think I felt dryer than before and the 3 months I took it my period was worse than it usually is every month!! My cramps were more intense and my flow was a lot heavier than usual and no matter how much water you drink when you take the pill it feels like it is stuck in your throat and leaves a horrible taste all day. May work for other people but I saw no difference at all with me.
2,Didn't see a difference,"I used this product for 2 straight months, and did not have a noticeable difference in my CM unfortunately."
2,Use vitamin A instead,I got better results by taking Vitamin A supplements and drinking more water - 8 glasses a day.
3,Seemed to work,"After using the product for a few days, I noticed right away that I had an increase in my CM, after finishing the bottle though, I didn't want to spend the money on the FertileCM, and ended up trying Vitex (for additional reasons other than CM)."
2,Worked but hesitant to try again,"This may be TMI but I have to share. The only time I ever saw fertile fluids was when I used this. I've been ttc for a few months and have been very aware of all my ""fluids"" and I never achieved the mythical egg white. (Even while drinking grapefruit juice or taking mucinex). I almost accepted that I was one of the ones that didn't get EW CM but I figured I'd give this a shot. For me this worked but I think it also modified my ovulation date. This last cycle I used Fertile CM my chart had a crazy quasi rise and then dropped 3DPO and then another rise before I eventually got my period 4 days early. (My cycle has been like clockwork with ovulation on CD 13-14 and a 12 day luteal phase) I have no idea what happened. I'm going to try one more month before I blame these pills but wanted to share as a cautionary tale."
1,too big- too heavy,This is huge- Amazon gave no measurements- almost 20 inches wide and it is too heavy empty
2,An Ok power supply...,...but takes all day to charge. Ran desk top PC great.Runs lights too. Will not power up my (AC) coffee maker!(Not that powerfull I guess?) Fast Fed-Ex delivery!
4,Buen equipo,"Para nuestro trabajo es muy bueno, sobrevivió a una caida de unos 2 metros.No tiene la potencia como para mover un taladro robusto, pero si para recargar un Laptop u otros menores.Es claro que si tuviera mas potencia también sería más pesado y eso sería una desventaja. El equipo es muy liviano y la opción de ponerle una batería de auto, aumenta mucho su tiempo de trabajo."
5,My favorite music for Sunday morning...,"This is one of my top desert island CDs. It is incredibly soothing, grounding and quiet -- but strong, too. The music is absolutely mesmerizing, with beautiful music on top of quiet drumming. I love all of Gabrielle Roth's CDs, but this one is my favorite. This is the CD I put in every Sunday morning, early, before the rest of the world wakes up."
4,soothing mellow Gabrielle,This one is mellow and soothing compared to some of her others. I like it but sometimes it is too mellow. I can use this one for healing work and for putting me to sleep in a good vibrational energy.
5,Brilliant,"To people who reject newer narrative forms, I have always said that genius surfaces in every medium. The graphic novel MAUS is a good proof. Now, I have found another one in this fine work by David B. Epileptic is the life story, actually, of the author/artist, and his family as they go through the profoundly moving events surrounding David's older brother's epilepsy. I must say that the casual cruelty to which this child was subjected by the community was shocking. While it is true that that is the basic core around which the story develops, it is also about David's coming to grips with his own personal fears and demons, along with his development as an artist. It was interesting to see how much quackery his family was subjected to -- the desperate parents who love their son so much that they try anything at all that seems to offer hope. At any rate, I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the subject, and also anyone who is interested in outstanding graphic work."
5,my diagnosis,"david b. is a master when it comes to conjuring up the dark side of the imagination with this book about his brother's lifelong struggle with epilepsy, and the various, sometimes strange, adventures that it brought along. david's drawings will evoke a sense of twisted reality that is very effective in allowing the reader to understand the raw feelings david has with his brother's disease, and his unique perspective towards it. i found this book very intriguing and engrossing. this one is definitely one of a kind."
1,Don't buy the kindle edition,"The Kindle edition is literarilly unreadable. The resolution is very bad and it is impossible to read. I own the 9in kindle, I can't imagine how this could look in the 6in Kindle."
3,A Therapy Session,"The artwork is amazing; detailed and with life in spit of being in only two colors. David B. brings a real idiosyncratic and interesting style to the page.But, I'm not sure if I like the premise of the book. His brother had fairly severe epilepsy. His parents go far and wide to seek out a cure for his brother's disease. These two things define who David is, and who he becomes. The story, while reaching no resolution, is interesting. I learned much about the existence of fringe beliefs that represent what the parents sought out. I understand that David was self-centered as a child, but it seems that he never grew out of this. While he doesn't try to paint himself in glowing light, this book is too much about the author/protagonist. His sister disappears for most of the book, for example.While the book was well done, it was hard to read because I had little sympathy for the author. I'm somewhat sorry I invited myself to his therapy session."
2,entirely mediocre,"This book is fun for the first few pages, but then it fizzles. The writing is too clever for its own good, you don't care much about any of the characters and the plot is non-existent. There are SO many chick lit books that manage to be charming and entertaining, so this one is a failure by comparison. I'm not trying to compare it to great literature, but even within it's own somewhat trashy genre, it is remarkably undistinguished. I'm not sure what even kept me going except the drive to finish the darn thing and never have to see it again. Even the so-called sex scenes were a snore."
1,akkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk,"I hated this book. I could have cared less about any of these people and what happens to them. It was an excruciating experience to the end. The pace was slow and boring,the characters unbelievable and tedious. It as a shame and environmental travesty that trees were killed in order to publish this book. Pass it by"
4,Another Week in the Life of Susan,"Second book in the Susan Henshaw series.Susan is days away from her 40th birthday when she find out that Dawn Elliot, the neighborhood tramp, is moving back to town and all of Susan's insecurities resurface when she once again must be reminded of her husband affair with the woman. But Susan has other things on her mind as well, including the ""surprise party"" that he husband is planning - but that whole thing doesn't work out so well when Dawn's dead body is found behind the steering wheel of the brand new car that Jed bought Susan for the big 4-0.With the help of her friend Kathleen, an ex-detective, the two set out to solve the mystery of Dawn and the men she was involved with, including a strange husband, but this book quickly dissolves into naughty neighborhood goings on and storylines that could only be described as soap-operaeque. I don't know why I continued on with the series, other than its throw back to kinder gentler days of Dallas and Knot's Landing."
3,Unlikely ending,"Susan Henshaw is back with her friend Kathleen, who was a police investigator in the first book of the series and is now a friend and neighbor, married to a widower named Jerry. Kathleen lets it slip that Susan's husband Jed is preparing for a surprise party for Susan's 40th. birthday. Susan is already depressed by her approaching middle age and the fact that a woman named Dawn, who has had affairs with most of the men in the neighborhood, is back in town. The party becomes really depressing when a dead body shows up and Susan and Jed become murder suspects. There are no end of other people with motives, but the final conclusion is a weak one and the motive is pretty questionable. There are some nice touches, such as Susan's son Chad becoming a hero because of his knowledge of cars, but basically the book falls a bit flat at the end."
4,Good Detailed History,"Good for a history book and some general information about the GTO. Will not have good detailed information about part numbers, assembly, paint colors, etc. There is another book out there that is good for that. Overall I like the book and is a good overall reference."
3,Monsters of the garden variety.,"The small town of Merton is overrun with carnivorous slugs in yet another entry in the mutated pest genre created by James Herbert's classic novel The Rats. Shaun Hutson heaps on the grue and keeps the pace lightning fast, so the strong stomached reader can expect to finish the book in less that a day or two. Not high literature, but passable entertainment with quite a nasty edge."
4,Watch where you step!,"""Slugs"" is one creepy, gross, disgusting, and completely fun horrific read. Seriously, ""Slugs"" should be required reading for all horror fans! At just over 200 pages, you can read it in one day! It should have been longer, as the conclusion seems a bit rushed and perfunctory. Complaint aside, it's the build-up and gruesome descriptions of slugs eating through folks that make this special. I was creeped out and fascinated at the same time as I compulsively turned page after page. Hutson really has his way with the reader's creep bone. Not that I've seen many in real life, but I mean, how scary is a slug really? Kudos to you Mr. Hutson: 4 stars easy."
5,Great Belt,This is a great belt. My original broke on my toro riding mower and we replaced it with this. Fits perfectly.
2,Not all the answers I was hoping for.,"This book was okay, didn't go deep enough for me. Just the basics which the answers can be found on any google search. I thought because this was written by a PHD/MS specialist, it would contain some of my questions for a 34 yr old with MS."
3,Old Answers for New Questions,"Unfortunately, a lot of this information is out of date -- and even if it wasn't, it's some of the answers to some of the questions you might have, presented in a sometimes easily accessible but sometimes difficult to access fashion. Some of the contributions are far more useful than others.I appreciate the fact that Rosalind Kalb has been a tireless advocate for people with MS, and I hope she updates this book (with a better format) -- but still I wish there were some MS ""advocates"" out there who weren't taking drug company money."
3,Outdated Information,"While this book was very informative, it had very outdated information. A separate booklet was sent with this book, to update some of the information, but even this was outdated material. I don't think enough information was given about the various tests that you have to go through, to be diagnosed. Telling a person more about what to expect during these tests, helps to alleviate the patients fears."
5,An important consumer's handbook,"The brand-new third edition of Rosalind Kalb's classic guide, Multiple Sclerosis: The Questions You Have, The Answers You Need, fully updates medical information with the latest details, covering a range of topics in a handy question-and-answer format which makes it easy to understand MS management. Each chapter also includes a list of references and recommended reading, along with a glossary of terms and resource list, making Multiple Sclerosis an important consumer's handbook with readily-accessible details for concerned non-specialist general readers."
5,The best overall reference text for questions about Multiple Sclerosis,"This book answers most of your questions about MS with short, readable, and reliable answers. Very good indexing and cross referencing to related questions helps to find the right question to ask for the information you want. More expensive than other MS books, but packed with far more content. We use this book all the time in my MS support group."
4,Great so far,"Only had these for about a month, but so far I'm very satisfied with the pans. They look good and are sturdy and easy to handle. Clean up is a breeze. I use the pans for just about anything I cook, not just omelets. The only reason for a four star is the fact that I will not know for quite sometime how the non-stick coating will wear."
4,Nice set,"This set of ""Calphalon Contemporary Nonstick 10- and 12-Inch Omelet Pans, Set of 2"" are a handy addition to every kitchen, it;s great for omelets and making crepe's , however you have to be real careful with the nonstick surface, as they scratch way to easily,"
2,The quality doesn't last,"I am now on my second set of these pans. The first set was replaced after the nonstick surface began to wear off before the 5-year mark. I've been very careful with both pans, washing them as directed, nothing but plastic cookware. But they just don't last. I would not buy these again because if you use them nearly every day, as I do, then the nonstick surface begins to come off about one year after use. Very disappointing because I had read good things about this cookware."
3,Cheap,The good thing is they are cheap for 2. The bad thing is the coating wears off. I have the 12 inch in storage... too large to use daily. But the 10 inch coating has worn off and is chipping off. I need to throw this away... dangerous to injest this coating. My husband is not wanting me to toss the pan at the end of it's lifespann but I know it is not safe to eat from this now that it is chipping and peeling. What else works other than stainless steel? I want a durable pan that LASTS. I will use it 1-3 times a day. I like the idea of nonstick. Might have to go back to stainless steel.
2,"Spin, spin","We have owned Fissler, Berndes,ScanPan, etc. This by far has been the worst. It spins like crazy on our flat cooktop. Also, the non-stick is the stickiest we have ever had. Don't even consider this if you have a flat surface. My neighbor has the same problem. Will be avoiding Calphalon due to the major lapse in this design."
2,Only good for a year,"These pans are great at first, nothing and I mean nothing sticks to them. Unfortunately that doesn't last. About 6 months out things started to stick a little bit. By one year everything and I mean everything sticks to them. The coating looks great and we've taken great care to only wash it with a sponge. They were very disappointing and I won't buy Caphalon non-stick again. I'd suggest trying somebody else's pan before these."
2,disappointed,"I am really dissapointed in the quality of the pans. No matter what I use, be it butter, spray or oil everything seems to stick. Today as my husband was making an omelet, he became so frustrated he said, ""throw them away!"" Sorry but this is my personal experience."
2,Good for a few uses....,I bought these pans two years ago. The 10 inch pan was awesome and it was sturdy and I used it almost daily. I started using the 12 inch pan on a regular basis just a few months back and I am seeing scratches and the coating is also starting to come off. I take very good care of the pans. So the manufacturing is not of high quality. If others have similar issues let me know.
4,"Great product, terrible packaging.","These pans are well worth the money. The handle stays cool, they cook evenly everytime and are sturdy enough to last for years with proper care. The only bad thing I can say is that the box they were shipped in was ripped at the corner, and one of the handles was sticking out. In addition to that, there was ZERO padding. The pans were not wrapped in cardboard, bubble wrap or any padding."
4,Nice pans for the money,"I bought these because to replace a Calphalon Commercial Nonstick pan I'd had for more than 10 years. The non-stick surface had expired some time ago. I've always been happy with Calphalon for certain types of pan, and the price was right.I found that these pans were a little lighter than what I'd had, and didn't sit firmly on my (somewhat uneven) burners. I also realized that I'd misjudged the size - 8"" is right for a 2-egg omelette, and 10"" for 3 eggs. 12"" is great for a lot of things, but not for an omelette. I gave these to someone who needed them, and who likes them very much, and got a great deal on a pair of 8"" and 10"" Calphalon Unison omelette, which were everything I wished they'd be.These are very good pans, but if you have the money (check Williams Sonoma for the best deal), go for the high end Unison line."
4,Excellent pan but watch for defects on arrival,"I had to return the first two sets that Amazon shipped to me because the 12"" pan in each set had a small hole in the teflon coating (about 1/8"" diameter near the outer extent of the flat base of the pan). As always, Amazon was great about handling returns and my replacement units arrived very quickly. Still, caveat emptor. Inspect your pans carefully when you wash them prior to the first use and don't rip up that nice cardboard hold that they come in.I bought these pans to replace a 12"" hard anodized that had been scratched by metal tongs and lost it's black finish due to several trips in the dishwasher. Now that I have a pair without defects, I'm very pleased with my new pans. They have a heavy bottom and are very flat. And the metal handles means they can go straight from the stovetop into a hot oven."
4,"So far, so good.","I bought these about a month ago. So far, so good. Nothing is sticking, clean up is easy. I would definately recommend."
1,nonstick...coating!,"After only three months of responsible use (plastic or silicone spatulas, cleaning only with liquid ""green"" detergent and a non-scratch scrub pad) we have a hole in the non-stick coating. We do follow a low-fat, vegetarian diet, but always lubricated the pan with vegetable oil before adding food. If you invest this much money, get a Swiss Diamond--that lasted us four years. As for me, I plan to buy a new, cheap non-stick pan every 6 months."
2,If You Hang Your Pans Forget These!,"The hanging holes on the handles of these pans are slanted and near useless for the purpose. Designed by style conscious idiots, no doubt, as you will curse and wrestle with them each time you attempt to retrieve them from their hooks. If you have room to stack them in a cupboard, you will undoubtedly find them more to your liking."
2,You get what you pay for....,"A previous reviewer commented: If you have a ceramic stove top, be warned that these pots warp when they are hot, so they do not sit flat and they do not heat evenly or well.I agree wholeheartedly- these pans are rather thin and have poor heat distribution, especially on a ceramic stove top.On the positive side, they are OK. They might be suitable as a starter set- attractive- have a good non-stick surface (so far).OTH- keep in mind that even with the Calphalon branding, they are cheaply made and will likely warp with high heat.I was a little disappointed. You do get what you pay for...."
1,"Great pans - that arrived useless - terrible, terrible packaging.","I gave it a one because I couldn't give it a ZERO. I ordered these pans because I have others just like this set and I absolutely love them! I bought the lids as well. The pans and lids came in a box at least 4 times the necessary size. They were not wrapped in any fashion and arrived with all kinds of dents, dings, and deep scratches. I called and requested another set and explained the packaging problem. The customer service rep was very, very nice and clearly stated the problem on the return. They sent me another set which arrived in the same box (a P5) and they were just as damaged as the first. So, I've returned the second set as well. What a shame!"
2,They've gotten cheaper!,"I miss the old, solid stainless steel handles they used to use on their pots and pans. Now they are just some cheap thin material that I'm not even sure is stainless steel. What a shame!"
1,Don't buy the nonstick cookware! Buyer Beware!!!,"I bought Calphalon's Contemporary cookware. What they don't tell you is that you can't wash your cookware in the dishwasher. Nowhere on the box or website does it mention this! You'll end up having to wash your pots and pans by hand even if you have a perfectly good dishwasher. If you wash it in the dishwasher, the coating fails and you void your warranty. What a scam! DO NOT BUY THIS COOKWARE!!!"
5,Outstanding Omelet Pans,"I love Calphalon pans, so this was a no brainer. I actually got these for my parents for Christmas, and they loved them!"
2,"BE CAREFUL WITH 10"" PAN HERE","I purchased the 12"" - 10"" pan set. I am very pleased with the 12"" pan BUT ... the 10"" pan (in my opinion) is rather dangerous. The design is poor because the handle is heavier than the pan part and it causes the pan to tilt/tip even while cooking. My pan almost fell off the stove as I was frying some eggs. I had to literally HOLD THE PAN ON THE BURNER TO FRY THE EGGS. After eggs were done, I experimented and fried a steak which is heavy, thinking it would BALANCE the pan. AGAIN, the pan tiled toward the weighty handle and began to slip off the burner but this time toward the countertop and not toward the floor. The design of the 10"" pan is FAULTY and DANGEROUS. A handle SHOULD NOT be heavier than the PAN PORTION. BE CAREFUL WITH THIS ONE."
2,Calphalon pans,"We have owned Calphalon pans for several years. I am not sure what the problem is but on an average, once a year I have to send the Omelet pans in for replacement because of flaking/pitting. Each time I send a pan in I include a letter stating the problem and ask what should I do to avoid this? I have never gotten an answer. We cook on propane and I make sure all steps are followed per instructions. Regardless, I still have the same problem. Yes, I use plastic utensils. Calphalon does replace the pans but I am stuck with cost of mailing etc. Because of the problem stated above and no response I will never buy another nonstick pan from Calphalon again. Sorry Calphalon."
3,"handles so long, tends to tip","Owned these for over a yr. now. non-stick surface lasting well, but unbalanced because handle so long. Doesn't sit flatly on electric stove burners. Cooks well though."
2,Poor packaging -> scratched pans,"The smaller pan sits inside the larger pan in the packaging. With nothing seperating the two pans, they grind together in transit. The larger pan was scratched. I was very disappointed when I opened it."
1,EXTREMELY poor handling at the point of manufacture...,"BOTH pans in the set arrived with significant scratches in the non-stick surface despite no damage to shipping box or product packaging which seems to keep the pans from touching each other. After I returned them for a replacement, the next set showed up in the same damaged condition. Since the scratches were under the product packaging, it is obvious that these pans were mishandled at the point of manufacture and shipping. Amazon handled the returns and refund without issue, but I would definitely like to discourage anyone from purchasing this particular set unless you would be interested in finding out how many shipments it takes to get a set that is undamaged."
2,Overrated,"I am really surprised by the number of 5-star reviews for this product.My chief complaint is the the screws which connect the pan to the handle. I noticed during the first use that food easily collects and sticks there. I have used these 5-6 times and each time I had to use a scouring pad to clean off these screws. Doesn't this kind of defeat the purpose of a nonstick pan?Although these are heavier than the cheap pans you might get at Walgreens, the nonstick surface itself does not seem of better quality. I have a nother Calphalon nonstick that had a ringed surface to augment the nonstick and I was hoping these would follow that pattern. Sadly they do not."
4,Good basics,I have a lot of Calphalon products. These are fine but seemed a bit lightweight. 12 inch is versatile for many recipes other than omelets
5,Best skillets,"I bought these skillets because of the great price and brand. Now I have two sets, one for home, and one for the motorhome. They are my go-to skillets for just about everything! Even heating, non-stick and easy to hand wash. Only mild complaint is they do scratch easily so I put a piece of shelf liner in between them when storing. I highly recommend this set!"
5,Great pans,I really like these pans. They are solid without being too heavy. Easy to use - I feel better using hard-anodized than traditional non-stick
3,Great pans.....while they last,"We have quite a few Calphalon non-stick pans and really like them alot. I purchased this set about 5 months ago and up until now I would have said wow 5 stars but now everything is starting to stick :( We do take care of the pans and do not use anything metal or damaging to the surface. Since the price is really good, I would have considered simply replacing these periodically knowing they are somewhat disposable IF they had lasted at least 12 months but sticking at 5 months is pretty much a deal breaker for me. We do use these everyday so your mileage may vary."
2,They don't last.,"I thought these were great pans at first. I've owned them for about 8 months, and was using them almost everyday, mostly to make breakfast. Now the surface is flaking off, so into the trash they go. They might be good if you don't cook much, but if you intend to use them alot, buy something else."
3,"Okay, BUT...","I received this set of pans for Christmas 2 years ago. At first, I was thrilled with them, they cooked very well. However as time went on, I became less thrilled. The 12"" pan is quite heavy and hard to handle. Even though I take great care not to damage the nonstick surface, never stacking them or allowing anything hard to come in contact with the teflon, after two years the surface is beginning to wear significantly. The pans are still usable, but I like the cheap anodized aluminum nonstick 12"" pan I got at my local Job Lot store so much better. Lighter, browns well, yet maintains a very slow simmer much better than these."
5,Awesome! Use them almost every day!,"Super non-stick, clean well, heat evenly.Finally have pans that match with lids.The sides are high so it makes stirring easier"
5,Great pan.,"This is an incredibly good pan at a very reasonable price. It makes cooking eggs a joy. I think all the bad reviews come from people who burn their pans and don't know how to cook. You have to keep these pans on low to medium heat. Otherwise they will burn. Never put them in the dishwasher. If you screw up your pan, then you abused it. That's your fault."
2,NOT Flat,"Tilts and rocks on glass top range because the bottom isn't truly flat. Since that is the most important feature on a glass top, nothing else matters. Skip it."
1,Disappointed,"After reading the reviews and being familiar with the brand, I bought these pans. I had used the small pan for less than a week and it was scratched. I have used non-stick pans for years and never had one scratch so easily. I only used plastic utensils to cook with and hand washed it however it scratched within a few uses. I returned them today."
2,After 2 years these pans are DONE!,"I received these as a Christmas gift 2 years ago. We use the small pan at least 3 times a week. We babied this pan because we loved it. It NEVER went in the dishwasher. I only used the proper utensils and sponge. I recommended this pan to anyone who would listen. My mind has changed. The coating is coming off A LOT! I am shocked by this and know it is not user error. I don't think they stand up to normal use and I think a pan should last longer than 2 years. Also, eggs do stick to the metal pieces that hold the handle to the pan. I don't think that's a huge deal but other reviews mentioned it so I thought I would chime in."
4,"Nice middle of road pans, good value.","I am impressed with the quality, price and cooking results of these nonstick pans. A good stepping stone to my next goal to obtain professional grade stuff."
1,Good but didn't last long,"We have had the set for about 12 months and the smaller pan's surface has already started to flake. We NEVER turn these pans up over medium heat, this pan has been babied, its a disappointment. Guess its a cheaper surface on a cheaper version of Calphalon pans."
2,damaged,"I usually love Calphalon, but it seems I received a dud from Amazon. I'm out of the return policy window, otherwise I would exchange. On the large pan, the handle is loose and bottom is warped so it doesn't cook thing properly. The other one is dented on the rim. Definitely not the Calphalon quality I'm used to."
5,"A joy generally, especially for eggs.","I bought these a couple weeks ago specifically to increase my ability to make over-easy eggs. With my old non-stick pan, yolks would often break due to adhesion between egg and pan. It was a cheap one, no doubt about it, and I paid for my cheapness. Thankfully, these were incredibly reasonably priced and have resulted in a complete turnaround in my egg-making ability. I haven't broken a single yolk with them yet! I've used these daily since getting them, for fish, meat, eggs and vegetables, and have been struck by how smooth the cooking process has become. As others have noted, they heat very evenly and retain that heat well. I typically use medium heat with silicone tools, and so am not overly worried about damaging the coating. A great set, one which I would recommend to anyone in a heartbeat."
4,Scuffed Handle,I bought these as a christmas present for my parents and I have personally used these pans that I got as a wedding present. I can say the durablity of these pans are amazing and clean off amazingly well provided you don't let it sit for a while. Obviously you must use nonstick safe utensils.The only issue I had was that one of you pans came with a long black scuff mark on the handle. It doesn't effect the quality of the pan in any way but I'm a little unhappy as this is a gift. If it were for me I would be fine with it.
5,Calphalon nonstick,"My son and his wife enjoy very much this pot, they can use it for many many things, there happy with this present. It was a good buy."
5,Great to supplement Language Arts,"This book has a variety of exercises; analogies, word pairs, word game, writing, etc. It also provides a variety of stories (Great connections, computer age, caves & caverns, unexplainable, urgent: energy) to interest students."
4,Controversy for new art in an old station,This book which I read for a museum studies class is an excellent retelling of the struggle to decide what to do with Gare D'orsay in Paris. The book which shows through a few plates the dramatic changes that took place in the station when the french ministry decided to convert it into a museum is beautiful. What is done extremely well in this book is the authors discussion of what art should belong in this museum. The discussion of what time periods this museum should encompass is very interesting and quite well thought out. If you are looking for an interesting book on museums in unusual spaces this is probably the most interesting. It is also a valuable teaching source for museum controversy.
3,Keep this book by your computer!,"If you're a writer...you need this book. It inspires. It picks you up when you're lower than aardvark excrement. It's not just a collection of quotes. It's a book of writing exercises. It's a book of one-on-one advice. It's like Rachel Ballon, Ph. D., is there with you listening to your frustrations as a writer. I keep it by my computer like a baby keeps a blanket."
5,Straightforward and lucidly written,"Having just finished using this text in the course of an undergraduate seminar, I can attest to the fact that the authors' style is outstanding - they are able to synthesize an enormous amount of material in this volume and present it in a manner that is highly accessible to almost all students of mathematics. The presentation of important theorems (for example, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz and Basis Theorem) along with just the right amount of copncrete examples makes for a book of superb quality. All-around, I highly recommend this volume to anyone who has an interest in learning about Algebraic Geometry."
5,I'm 20 now but I'm still love the show,DVD has 2 episodes:George vs Space invadersClose encounters of the bird kingPlus 1 episode from 7 little monsters
2,Cool but short lived,"Good looking shorts at a pretty good price. Sized HUGE for what other clothes sizing is. Zipper blew up in about 2 months. Unfortunately, I won't buy this again."
5,A great introduction to Web Services,"In my opinion, you must know a bit of C# to really get everything in this book. But the book is very well written and makes a complete intoduction into the Web Services. I only had problems while coding the authentication examples, the rest, worked great. A must have if you are getting into the service oriented architectures."
4,Overview of Service-Oriented Architecture,This book provides a very good overview of Service-Oriented Architecture in C#: Using the Web Services Enhancements 2.0. Mr. Hasan provides alot of background information and definitions for understanding the architecture and goes into detail about how the process works. I liked his writing style and ability to express these terms in a cohesive overview and explanation. I too like some of the readers would have liked to have seen a CD of code (I am a developer). I liked the discussion on security and that he alluded to the coming indigo development.
2,More about WSE less about SOA,"This book serves as maybe a decent reference book if that. First off, its hardly about SOA and doesn't cover anything deep enough to really use if you are trying to get into it. The author right away breaks one of the major tenants of SOA, sharing types. If you are too lazy to search msdn or the Internet on basic .net Web Services then maybe this is a book for you."
2,When will I learn...,Poor writing. Poor diagrams. Poor editing. Poor typesetting. Misguided sample code. Misleading title. Inaccurate information. Life is too short to waste your time reading this book when there are so many better titles. Burned by Apress again. When am I going to learn...
2,Disappointed,"You would think that Disney would provide the highest quality product. Think again. I purchased Disney Karaoke Discs 1-4 at Disneyland, thinking I would get ""the real thing."" Well, their vocal demonstration tracks were NOT taken from the movies but were sung by others (i.e. they had the well-known songs re-recorded by people we've never heard of, poor imitations of the original tracks), AND the words are only printed on an inside liner, not embedded in the discs. In other words, these are just song and music discs with no graphics at all. You can play them in a karaoke machine and you might as well be playing them in a regular CD player. If you plan on singing these songs, either memorize the words or carry the cumbersome songbook wherever you go. Not worth it."
2,Warning: Mislabeled as a Karaoke title. This is a Sing Along.,"Conventional Karaoke titles use CD-G formats. This should have been labelled a Disney Sing along Album. Printed lyrics do not make a Karaoke CD which is entirely misleading the general consumer.Fortunately the variety of songs and quality of the recordings still give a strong entertainment value for your child.If you want the variety of Disney music, here it is. If you want a sing along album, especially if you do not have a Karaoke player, you have your wish.If you want a Karaoke format, look elsewhere."
1,No fun!,"I can not believe this is marketed as a karaoke CD! This is just a regular music CD with the lyrics inside the package. The lyrics do NOT show up on the TV screen when put into the karaoke machine. No fun at all if you have to hold the microphone with one hand the the lyrics in another, under good light because the type is so small!!!! Oh yeah, great fun for a 6 year old.....NOT!!!"
1,Warning,"This was disappointing, to say the least. It is not a CDG. So, I would question their honesty in calling this Karaoke."
3,Disney Karaoke for kids,"thought this would have lyrics onscreen, but doesn't. I didn't read the fine print, I guess."
2,NO SCREEN DISPLAY,"THERE ARE NO WORDS THAT SCROLL AS DISPLAY ON TV/MONITOR.....THE CDIS STRICTLY ""AUDIO"".I THINK THE DESCRIPTION OR PICTURE DOES NOTREALLY CLEARLY STATE THAT THIS IS JUST A CD YOU CAN SING ALONG TOO...ORNOT A CD+G KARAOKE DISC."
1,Very Disappointed,I expected more from Disney I guess they are learning and now are doing better with what they have put out. But do not waste your money on it. Look for a more recent one which has lyrics as well as graphics. The songs on it aren't all that - I bought if for my daughter and even the music sounds a bit off when it goes without words. Really - save your money on this one! :0(
5,HELLO?!?!?!,"PEOPLE!! Come on! If you really want the words, just open the cute little lyric book and do what you learned to do when you were 5, READ!! Maybe you should have read a little about karaoke lingo before you bought these cds. To quote from Bill Engvall, HERE'S YOUR SIGN!!!!!!! And plus, how much were these things, like $10."
5,I'm making an album of Disney songs for my new grandchild and this has wonderful instrumental backgrounds.,"Great instrumentals, I'm making an album of Disney songs for my new grandchild and this is a great album of hits."
1,False Advertising; This is NOT a Karaoke CD,"Audio only, no graphics. Since karaoke doesn't work unless you have on-screen graphic prompts, this is a complete rip-off.Thanks for nothing, Disney and Amazon."
1,Waste of money,I wish I had read all the other reviews. I was expecting this to be a CD+G and it is not. What a waste of money!
1,Not a CDG,This is marked a karaoke CD although it obviously is not. Why not just call it Disney songs instead of misleading people?
3,Wish I had read the reviews first,I bought this plus volume 2 for my daughter's new karaoke machine. We were very disappointed that the words were not on the screen. They love the disney songs and we will use it in the car but not for the karaoke.
2,NOT for a karaoke machine but great music,"This CD is WILL NOT show lyrics on a karaoke screen. It is great if all you want is music. We bought it for a birthday party for my daughter in which karaoke was the main attraction. This CD has a booklet of tiny words with the lyricsDisney Karaoke, Volume 1. It WILL NOT show up on a karaoke screen. VERY disappointing."
2,Not a Karaoke CD--It is a Sing-A-Long,"I was very disappointed that this was not a true Karaoke CD. If you want the lyrics, you have to pull out the CD insert. The songs are not even from the original soundtracks. Very disappointed. I'm sure the kids will still listen to it, but for the money, it was a rip since I was expecting something to actually Karaoke too. Be aware and read reviews first.Disney Karaoke, Volume 1"
1,Beware--no onscreen lyrics.,My kids were very disappointed with this product. There are no onscreen lyrics. Truly not what we were looking for.
1,not karaoke,This is not karaoke and should not be titled let alone marketed as such. karaoke has the words on screen. This is nothing but an audio cd and should not be alowed to come up under a karaoke search. It is false advertizing
3,CD+G is a karaoke cd with words on the screen,"If a cd says ""karaoke"", it means it is instrumental. The Disney cd's do not say cd+g, which is the actual term for cd+graphics. CD+graphics are the karaoke cd's with the words on the television. If the karaoke cd you are buying does not say ""cdg"", then it will not have lyrics printed on the television. As of this time, there are few Disney songs that have the words printed on the tv. If Disney does decide to make karaoke cdg's, we will all be happier. Until that time, people can be informed of the actual terminology so they will or will not buy the correct items."
1,Shame on Disney for false marketing!,"IF you are looking to buy a KARAOKE CD, don't be fooled by the label! This is NOT a real karaoke CD. A real karaoke CD contains files that provide both music and lyrics on-screen. This CD contains two tracks of each song, one with background singers, one without. The lyrics are provided in a booklet format.While we waited for this CD to arrive, our children's expectations were very high. Their disappointment was too sad. Disney should be ashamed of themselves for marketing this as anything more than an audio CD."
2,The word Karaoke is miss leading,I wish I read the reviews for this product before buying. We bought this CD for my girls ages 6 and 7. They received a karaoke machine for Christmas and it only came with a demo so I bought this CD for them to enjoy. First thing that was disappointing was that there were no lyrics for them to see on the machine. Lyrics included meant in booklet form. This was not helpful when both girls were singing because they couldn't both read the small words at the same time. The music was just ok. They were not from the original score. I tried using youtube video with lyrics but the music went too fast or too slow. I will not buy another one of these CDS.
3,TexRose57,This item is ok. It doesn't have graphics to view the words on TV. Just music. Not the music I thought I had ordered though. But it is still being used.
1,Disappointed Disney tune lover,"With our purchase of a new karaoke machine, I also bought a number of karaoke packages, assuming that all were CD-G formatted. I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing Vol 1-3 (unfortunately I purchased them on the German site since I am temporarily in Germany, and Amazon.de has no reviews listed), otherwise I would have spared myself some disappointment and money. Being a Disney tune lover, I was so excited to get these discs, only to find out that they are not CD-G formatted! These should NOT be labelled as karaoke, but as a sing-a-long. I am very disappointed with Disney."
2,If I would've read more closely...,"As others mentioned, these are not the songs from the original movies, and it's NOT a CD+G. Lyrics will not be displayed on a karaoke machine. A copy of lyrics in the booklet does not a karaoke CD make. Don't like to be mislead as a customer. Won't buy this brand again."
5,Another Nameless Detective page-turner,"One of the oldest gambits in PI fiction is the dead body that turns up with the detective's business card in a pocket. Pronzini breathes new life into that scenario with ""Labyrinth."" Nameless has no idea who the dead girl is -- how did she get his card? This book has tons of action and excitement; thank goodness it's short enough to devour in one or two sittings. Fans of the PI genre have got to check out Nameless. The books are best read in order, so it's a major shame that they're out of print -- but they are certainly worth tracking down."
2,Disappointed,"You would think that Disney would provide the highest quality product. I purchased Disney Karaoke 1-4 at Disneyland, thinking I would get ""the real thing."" Well, their vocal demonstration tracks were NOT the original songs but were sung by others, and the words are only printed on an inside liner, not embedded in the discs. In other words, these are just song and music discs with no graphics at all. You can play them in a karaoke machine and you might as well be playing them in a regular CD player. If you plan on singing these songs, either memorize the words or carry the cumbersome songbook wherever you go. Not worth it."
1,Disney Karaoke is not true Karaoke,I bought this CD for my daughter because of the words 'Karaoke' on the cover. I thought that it would be a real Karaoke CD- one that provides words on the screen of a Karaoke Machine. It does have the words inside the package but not in the CD. To me that is false advertising. It is a lovely collection of Disney tunes-but 11 of them are instumental! How are you supposed to sing along with instrumental songs? I feel like I was dupped and riped off.
2,Disappointed,"Thought that with the name saying Karaoke it would actually be a karaoke cd with the lyrics showing up on the monitor for my kids to use to sing, but it doesn't. Would classify this as a sing along disc instead. Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews of this or volume 1&3 so I have 3 disney ""karaoke"" cds with out lyrics on the monitor and not even the originally performed songs from the movies. I realize that originally karaoke cassettes were without lyrics and had them inserted in the case, still doesn't change the fact that with todays technology, to call this a karaoke cd is wishful thinking. Will not be buying anymore Disney Karaoke cds after this. Will stick to other karaoke discs that I know are CD+G."
1,Takes guts to call it Karaoke,"to the person who speaks of history of karaoke with cassette tapes. That is what that is. History. This CD billed itself as a Karaoke. It does not serve that purpose. It is very misleading. For it to be correct, it should be called really cool Disney songs with instrumental tracks and vocal tracks. It is not karaoke, and it therefore gets a very low score from me due to the misleading information."
2,Good songs but it's not a CD+G,"I was disappointed when my daughter went to use this for the first time in her karaoke machine, because I thought that it was a CD+G and would have the words appear on the TV. Unfortunately, even though this is called a karaoke disk, it does not have lyrics that appear on karaoke machines."
1,MISLED,"I PURCHASED THE DISNEY KARAOKE CD FOR MY GRAND CHILDREN SO THEY COULD SING ALONG. HOWEVER, THE WORDS ARE NOT AVAILABLE ON SCREEN, THE CD IS MERELY A MUSIC CD AND IF YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW THE WORDS YOU WILL NOT BE SINGING ALONG. I WAS LED TO BELIEVE THE CHILDREN WOULD BE ABLE TO LEARN THE SONGS, INSTEAD THEY WILL BE LISTENING TO SOMEONE ELSE SING. IT'S KIND OF LIKE WATCHING SOMEONE ELSE PLAY A SPORT. BIG DEAL!"
1,Disney,We didn't like it because it doesn't work on our machine (the words do not display on the TV)
3,end of an epic...,"It was an end, though not as clean as I would have hoped... there were a few things that were definitly cleared up nicely... and there are a few things that made me go Hmmm? the end of the book quite confused me, it seemed abrupt though I do realize that it concluded Sanglant and Liaths lives.. Which I suppose was the point... As a book I enjoyed it but as a finish for this series... I was hoping for a lil more... I think the beginning of the series spoiled me..."
2,Disappointing Ending,"Kate Elliott is an excellent writer but doesn't seem to be able to pull off a satisfactory ending. It feels like it's almost dinner time and she needs to wrap everything up before dinner is on the table and winds up with an ending that just leaves one unsatisfied. After reading her Jaran series (which also had a disappointing ending), I wondered if this one would end poorly as well...and it did."
4,Book OK Series Too Long,"In general this is a good series and I enjoy the way the author writes.I have come to believe, however, that any series of more than 3-5 books just gets too long. There can be too many side plots which can get too involved or the characters start dealing with variations of the same problems and you begin to loose interest."
4,Vol #7 Crown of Stars,"Though this is not the fast paced, heart pounding of earlier volumes Kate does a great job of tying it all together. I've given 4 stars for that reason and wish I could give another 1/2 star as she just dosen't leave you hanging with ""What now"" on your brain, as so many do, but goes fast forward to the future to let you see what transpired afterward and she does leave the door open for someone to pick up the fight somewhere down the road."
2,Shame on Daw books . . .,"I thought this series was great. So good, in fact, that I faithfully collected it in hardcover until this last book. Has anyone else noticed that DAW along with other publishers have switched to low quality materials for their hardcover books? Take a look at the paper for instance. We all paid a lot of money for a seriously inferior product. Just compare the other volumes in this set and the 6th and 7th books. You won't like it when the first 5 look okay in about 5 years, but the 6th and 7th are already yellowed with age.I'm really annoyed at this new trend and can tell you, don't waste your money paying hardcover prices for what is in essence, a large paperback. Shame on DAW!"
4,Read it in a day!,"Beamon is all too human and vulnerable in this tale of kidnapping, good old boys and religious fanatics. I was snared into the story on page three and kept reading until I finished. I really cared about the characters and wanted vengeance on the bad guy, so to speak. I will definitely read his other books."
2,SO-SO,"This is the first title by Kyle Mills that I have read, and it will probably be my last. I judge a book by the story it tells and it is a strange mixture of an FBI agent (the hero), and The Church of the Evolution (the villian). It is a unique story but it moves VERY slowly and it takes a while before we begin to care about the characters. The book starts off interestingly enough by a kidnapping and murder-suicide, but just mires around for a couple more hundred pages and that is where the book fails."
4,"Non-stop suspense and action, a Great Read","Kyle Mills has created an interesting character in Mark Beamon - a suffering, slightly edgy, moral man who refuses to back down, kind of like a pit bull who will protect til the end. The introduction of a cult-like religion was a twist. This book was so well written, planned out, it had you rooting for Mark Beamon (along with a cast of characters that were irritating, frightening and endearing). There were so many surprises and the premise of our privacy being invaded by a group of people with a different agenda was definitely not a far fetched idea."
3,"Interesting Premise, Good Thriller","This is the second of Kyle Mill's books that I have read. Rising Phoenix was a good (notice I say GOOD not GREAT) thriller as well.Unlike some of the reviewers I really like Mark Beamon, the ""hero"" of Kyle Mills books. His sense of humor and unhealthy lifestyle are a nice change from alot of ""heroes"" in other books. The pace moves quickly and keeps you interested. A few times I found myself saying ""Now that was dumb Mark, why don't U do this"". Of course being a reader you tend to have both sides of the story so it's easy to know what to do.Glad I waited to get this book in paperback, but it's definitely worth a read."
5,Better than Rising Phoenix,"I liked Kyle's first book, Rising Phoenix, but it wasn't enough to put him on my personal 'A' list of authors. However, Storming Heaven is so good that he immediately jumped up towards the top.The characters are very compelling and are the strength of the story. This is definitely not one of those hollywood script style books like so many authors are putting out now. The characters and plot are thoroughly fleshed out and the detail is compelling.If you like your heros flawed then Kyle's Mark Beamon is for you. He has drinking and weight problems, plus he has a hard time getting along with his boss (or any 'authority figure'). Beamon is truly one of the most memorable protagonists I have seen in a long time.I highly recommend this book and think that if you enjoy real characters and good suspense you will enjoy it too."
3,Disappointing,"I thought Rising Phoenix was an excellent first novel, and could hardly wait for #2 from this author. Storming Heaven turned out to be a disappointment. The story starts off well.... then becomes pretty tedious (it's obvious what's happened to our heroine very early on)... and then moves back to a better pace mid-way through the book. This is an OK, not great, book.... but, if you think you'll be following Mark Beamon in future novels, you'll want to read this for continuity. As a protagonist, Beamon is cool!"
4,"Good book, really grabs you in the last 100 pages.",Storming Heaven was a great read. Kyle Mills paints an interesting picture and especially a unique character in Mark Beamon. Looking forward to the next thriller. The last 100 or so pages really keeps you glued.
3,Entertaining but not spectacular,"Although the premise is clever, I couldn't muster up enough believability to really get into this book. It would help if Beamon were a more likeable character. Mills first book, Rising Phoenix was much better. I do think this author will improve, and I will no doubt read his next installment."
3,I 'read' this novel as a book on tape and found it okay but not great,"I was looking forward to hearing this as a book on tape since I had found another of Mills' books, 'Rising Phoenix' to have been most excellent - thought-provoking, challenging and entertaining.This one was merely most adequate. It was admirably performed by veteran character actor Joe Grifasi but the ending of the story lacked punch.'Storming Heaven' was a basic thriller, which left me unsatisfied after having had such an overwhelmingly positive experience with 'Rising Phoenix'.Don't rush out to find this book. Take your time and look around. You'll probably find something else better."
2,Disappointed,"I really thought that this book was going to be great, but in actuality it's a mediocre piece of fiction. You have to give the author some credit for the plot, but I found this novel incredibly hard to finish due to the fact that it wasn't interesting. Save your time and your money by avoiding this book."
3,About the same as Rising Phoenix but w/o the great premise,"If you liked Rising Phoenix, you'll probably like this as well. As a light read, it's ok. But again, Beamon just isn't very likeable or believable as a hero or the kind of super cop you'd expect from a story like this.The premise of this doesn't come close to being as good as Rising Phoenix, but the author does a good job of hooking the reader early in the story because you really have no idea what is going on, but the early events make you curious enough to want to find out. However, once the church gets into the picture, the story falls apart a little. The church just isn't very believable. And that and Beamon together is just a little too much.This is just about on par with Rising Phoenix, so if you liked that, I suppose this is worth your time as well."
5,Excellent,Tight story line - Not predictable. Kyle Mills has an excellent manner of portraying sociopathy with style. His Rising Phoenix is even better. Can't wait for the next one!!!
4,Storming Heaven,"In this writing Kyle Mills has exceeded himself..basically this is an expose of a sect that has become so brazen as to challenge our normal mores and beliefs. ""Storming Heaven"" has well developed characters and is well written, and when one puts aside the diversions Kyle hands us, (the bogus kidnapping, for one), it becomes a suspenseful examination of the intent and purpose of the cult itself.Mark Beamon, our less than totally heroic figure, is portrayed as a stumbling, bumbling FBI agent who has been demoted and exiled to the boonies...if Flagstaff can be called the boonies. Here, his investigation of a double murder, a disappearance thought to be a kidnapping, and his involvement with the Church of Evelution, a cult with worldwide ambitions, is enough to keep us turning the pages to see what else he will encounter. A good read.E.J. Walden, author of ""Operation Snow Owl"""
1,complete propaganda garbage,"Anyone writing a positive review on this propaganda hit piece, is either smoking some good stuff or they a have motive other than being truthful."
5,"witty, magical fairy tales","My undisputed favorite story in this book was ""The Madman of Naranath."" I laughed aloud. I showed it to my brother. He laughed aloud. It is a truly wonderful satire on human greed and court proceedings, and shows a clever, good-natured con artist at work. It could have happened in real life, which is more than I can say for the rest of the stories. This is not to say that the other stories are not also enjoyable. Magic has its own laws. I did not expect to find even one realistic tale here! This is a great book for children and adults of all ages. Timeless. It belongs in every library."
2,Gas Cap,"It looks real nice but barley screws into our 2004 Toyota Tundra SR5 ""Access Cab's"" fuel tank. It only goes in a little but does lock.Amazon does not have the correct information about our truck in their system, we have a ""access cab"" which is not listed in Amazon but is the correct Toyota designation/name for our vehicle. This makes it very hard to order the correct sized parts for our truck![...]"
3,Mostly for collectors,"This 1967 Chess album finds Muddy Waters stripped of his guitar, but his usual backing band is there, although they mostly take a back seat to the overdubbed brass ensemble which lends a distinct almost soul-like R&B flavour to the music.There are some nice, tight renditions of songs like ""Corine, Corina"", ""Sweet Black Angel"", and ""Piney Brown Blues"" here, and Muddy proves to be a pretty good R&B-crooner, but these songs lack the grit of Muddy's ""regular"" recordings, and they often seem stiff and a little too mannered for their own good.""Brass And The Blues"" is an experiment which works pretty well, but it's never really interesting, partly because of the stale arrangements, and partly because of too much weak material. Fans will probably want a listen, but casual listeners don't need to bother."
3,Attenborough it ain't,Ok if you're just looking for basic knowledge. High school level stuff. Maybe we are all spoiled by David Attenborough's Nova series.
2,I'm baffled,"The music is simplistic and repetetive. The lyrics are so moronic and childish, that one is led to wonder whether these songs were written by either a perverted 4 year old, or a frenchman with a sick sense of humor. Clearly, the lyricist has no grasp of the english language, as evidenced with the not-tongue-in-cheek absurdity of songs like ""Frank Sinatra"". For the hilarity that ensues from the mangled words, I give 2 stars. What confuses me most is that there are actually people that earnestly LIKE miss kittin. 0_0"
2,bit weak,"I got this based on the positive reviews and the price. I'm a big fan of Felix da Housecat's Kittenz and da glitz, so I thought I'd try this. I'm not that impressed. The music was simple and emotionless. Like it came from a $20 cassio keyboard...and nothing else. The tracks were ok but all about the same like listening to the same song over and over except for a brief pause of a french track. Oh well I'll keep it but it'll be at the bottom of my playlist."
1,Very Poor Reception,Can barely hear the person on the other end of the line over the static. Very sorry to have purchased and would like to return.
1,not dept 56,am aware of the difference between the Dept 56 reindeers which were produced prior to 2008 and the new Patience Brewsters reindeers which are being produced NOW. I specifically ordered these from you because you stated they were Dept 56 and I am trying to complete my set of DEPT 56 Krinkles Reindeers. Your advertising is very misleading and I was disappointed to receive the newly distributed reindeers. There are slight differences other than the boxes and I am trying to complete an ORIGINAL DEPT 56 COLLECTION...that is why I purchased these from you. I expect that you will correct this situation so that I don't have to contact Amazon and point out your misleading advertising...as there is a difference!!I look forward to a quick resolution
2,short life battery,"No where did it say that this was a short life battery. The old battery I had before lasted years. The camera didn't use a recharge system. So thinking that I had a good buy, now I realize that I will have to keep ordering batteries or ditch the camera."
2,Not long lived. Not a Sony.,Only lasted for a year and then went dead as a doornail. I have now coughed up the $40 for a genuine Sony.
1,Huh?,"I already own season one and the first volume of season two, which is all that's been released to date. How can it suddenly be possible to purchase seasons one and two but not season two separately? Is this some kind of a joke? To get the second half of season two I have to repurchase the season and a half I already own? Not likely. Fortunately a German company seems to be releasing the entire series (the complete series of 'Fury' is also available on the German site: amazon.de)."
2,disappointment,"I was disappointed with this item not because of the series which I enjoy ,but because I thought it was the complete two seasons but Season 2 is only Volume 1 so you are 15 episodes short. Anyone buying this product should be aware of this fact."
3,Smear Campaign,"Bought these pens for my dad who always loses pens. I also needed to go past that dollar amount for free shipping ;) Well, if you are left handed they will smear as you use them, he seems to have more ink on his hand then on the paper."
5,excellent....,So far this book has really been helpful in doing exactly as the title says. I'm impressed with the format and would recommend it to anyone!
4,"easy to understand, analytic, but too cliched","I brought this book because I am a stressed out college undergrad trying to place a deterrent to the inevitable stresses and concerns everyday. After reading the author's bio, I decided to purchase it. After flipping through the first pages, though, i realize that it is a book with too much ambition - although a little bit of everything is talked about (post-traumatic stress/other psyc stuff, think patterns, life-stories), it tries to reach all different types of audiences - parents, lovers, managers. It is helpful, but I would not recommend it if you want to own this book like a life line."
3,A good confidence booster,"i bought this during a troubled time in my life, and it was very helpful. All was not lost, and this book facilitated in my refocusing on me finally, and not those that were taking advantage of me."
5,The point of Ultimate Release,"Not often can one have something that can't be left alone. As such this book has that effect, excellent product."
5,Extremely insightful book,"Here you will learn (among other things) the ABC method of raising your optimism (closely aligned with resiliency) which has the potential of curing what many people call ""depression"". This book is so important, that I selected it from among hundreds to use in a teleclass I am teaching to other coaches in the Professional Coaches Association of Michigan about Positive Psychology and Strengths-Based Organizations.The book discusses the Resilience Factor index, a free online assessment that assesses your resilience along several factors. A very worthwhile book, to study as well as to simply read."
4,"hey, it ain't that bad......","I don't know why 'music fan' 's review below me takes such offense to this fine album.. it's funky , it's dirty, just the way I like my blues. I kinda dig the doubletracking done on his voice, it gives the recording very much kind of a creepy quality . you may dig it too. this is the first album from JL Hooker that I 've listened too, so my discoveries are just beginning. check it out"
3,"A fine conclusion to the series, but not the place to start","This is the final installment of Marco Polo's survey of the twelve symphonies by Alexander Moyzes (1906-1984) performed by the Slovak Radio Orchestra under Ladislav Slovák, and again the performances are more than serviceable - in fact, with respect to performance and sound quality this is perhaps the best in the series.The symphonies here are of the same conservatively tonal style of the predecessors. The 11th is mainly light-hearted (except for the very beginning) and partially based on dance-rhythms, the twelfth is more concentrated and is written in a simpler language than any of the previous symphonies. Both are fine works, but no masterpieces - in fact, I find it hard to shake the feeling that Moyzes' level of inspiration might have flagged a little in these final works."
2,Reasonable information marred by awful writing,"I'm a beagle owner and was happy to receive this book as a gift. That was until I started reading it. While it does an adequate job of covering basic information about the breed, the writing is bad enough to be a constant annoyance to anyone with a grasp of grammar or style. Most egregious is the author's incomprehensible choice to substitute the proper names of dogs for indirect references and even pronouns. So instead of saying something like ""your beagle may be difficult to toilet train"" or ""beagles are difficult to toilet train,"" we must read ""Rosie may be difficult to toilet train."" Multiply this by thousands of references, and you may slowly be driven insane; certainly I was. I have since bought ""Training your Beagle"" by Kristine Kraeuter and found it includes even better research and breed information without the fanciful and disastrous prose."
2,Beagles For Sale???!!!,The book is immoral. We need to adopt rescue Beagles. Apparently Mr. Rice hasn't heard about all the Beagles slaughtered each year who never find a home.
5,Cumbia Perfect!,"The ""Rough Guide to Cumbia"" CD is more than I hoped for. It is absolutely perfect. It is so good that the painter (from Colombia) who is painting our hallways rang my doorbell to ask about it. He wants a copy too. He danced out the door. These are some the older and great performers with an authenticity that is obvious. My only small complaint is the selection by Lisandro Mesa. I think he has better recordings of this song. The range of artists and forms of cumbia is extensive and, as I said, perfect."
5,Amazing!,"This is my second purchase of a ""Rough Guide"" world music cd, and both have been stellar (the other is the Hawaiian music compilation). This cd is a delightful addition to my music collection. The music is expressive, colorful, and rhythmic, without any cheesy over-production or invasive pop-culture influences. Those of you who enjoyed Buena Vista Social Club will love this! I would highly recommend this compilation to any music fan."
5,FANTASTIC!,"I'll make it short-this is truly the best collection of authentic Cumbia out there. Well done Rough Guides! If you're interested in Latin music, you some times come upon a couple of tracks with this infectious beat and wonder where you can get more. Well, here it is! This CD has all the great Cumbia bands of the past and present. Every single track is a gem in it's self, and is guarenteed to make you dance, sing (even if you don't understand a word, like me), and feel fantastic! Buy it, you won't regret it!"
3,"good, but not good enough","This is a great review book and intro book to IIS 4.0, but it will not cover enough material for the actual exam. My strategy to pass consisted of this book, actual practice and creation of my own web site using IIS, Transcenders, and brain dumps from the internet. Ultimately, the book gave me a good understanding of the app, but it was the brain dumps that saved the day."
2,Disappointing,I must admit that I was pretty dissapointed with this book. I found it difficult to read compared with the Exam Cram series. Most of the mistakes in the book are in the Review Questions. Not a good place to have errors! I just may give up on this book and move on. I'm over half way through it and don't rally feel like I've learned anything.
5,IIS 4.0 Rapid Review Study Guide,"I liked the book. It was the second one I read on IIS 4. The subject was well covered. I felt prepared for the test. Of course the idea that all you need is to read one book and you will pass is nonsense, unless you have a lot of experience with the product. Yes, there were a few errors, but every MCSE book I've read has them. What I liked most about the book was the way complex issues were explaned. I kept saying to myself as I read, ""OK, now I understand"". Everything was helpful, nothing I didn't need to know. The pactice test on the CD was quite helpful as well."
4,good book but not good enough,"I just passed the IIS 4.0 exam with 800. It is a very tough one. I have no experience with IIS. It took me almost 4 weeks to prepare, while it only took me 2 weeks for other MCSE exams. I used this book, Transcender and other books, but none of them covers half of the details from the exam. Although kind of dispointed, I have to say this book is more helpful than all the others that I had."
5,A must have for passing IIS 4.0,"This book throughly expains IIS 4.0 inside and out in terms that even a non technical person could understand. I read Exam Cram and Sybex series on IIS 4.0 and this has got them both beat. Even if you dont have access to IIS and NT Server and cant do the hands on exercises (which are great) you will still get all the info you need to pass the exam. The great thing is you dont have to wade through alot of junk you dont need to know. As the book claims ""This is all you need to pass IIS 4.0"". The practice quiestions at the back of the chapter and on the CD are also good. It helped me to pass my last exam and now I am MCSE! Randy McHugh A+,MCSE and MCP+I"
2,"To play 2 or 3 times. Then, it will remain in the shelf...","Nothing memmorable, like the previous Gyllene Tider stuff. It's the kind of catchy music that has nothing to say. Just melodies, no great lyrics. Fun to listen to at first. But after a few listening, you get tired of it.Buy something more interesting instead."
1,Letters are all the same and don't offer much variety,"I think the letters in this book are just average, and they focus on me, me, me. There is nothing that helps the writer craft a letter to meet the needs of the employer. A good title, but this books misses the mark."
4,democratic leadership,"An great book for understanding about leadership in ancient Athens. Since Pericles was elected to the position of general once a year he was required to walk a political tightrope. This book will give you a good feel for the difficulties of yearly elections. You will not get great detail for the life of Pericle beyond Plutarch. Fans of leadership, democracy, warfare and international relations this book is a must!"
1,Not Any Improvement Over old CD Versions-- What a SHAME!!,"I bought this disc from a local retailer, it is not DVD-A by any standards(No surround that I can discern, my older CD's of this piece sound better than this disc even in matrix mode). It barely triggers my surrounds and the packaging even states (on close review) that the surround track was recorded at 44.1 KHz (nothing better than CD resolution) I have contacted Naxos USA expressing my dissappointment with this disc 3 WEEKS (yes WEEKS) ago and still have not heard one word back from them, so I can only assume I only one of many who have called them to task on this disc, and they don't know how yet to fix it.Thank you,C. Brent Smith"
1,What a stinker...,"I agree with the first reviewer. This is NOT a performance worth purchasing. It's shrill, poorly recorded, and doesn't come close to being a surround mix. Avoid at ANY cost."
1,Problems with 'miracles' in the Stalinst era Ukraine,"This book contains what are said to be many miraculous events crammed into the life of a Ukrainian peasant boy who has a very rough life under the Stalinist purges in the 1920's and 1930's.The book glows with self righteous satisfaction that the lad was able to grow up and minister to thousand of his fellow believers in Soviet Russia. But Stalin was no mug: if he wanted to stop a minister he had his devious ways, and find it very difficult to accept logically that a miracle occurs every time the minister escapes her persecutors.If a miracle is correctly defined as a belief in the existence of a fact in the face of contrary evidence, then I suppose anyone can claim miraculous events have occurred when that person is the sole witness to the alleged miracle.But the author really gives the game away when he concedes he entered the USA and studied to be ordained a pastor in his boutique religion."
1,A one idea book,This book has one idea -- feed from a data base -- and he beats it to death. It is not really helpful beyond the data base idea.
1,Lots of White Space....,This books packs about 20 pages of content in to 250 actual pages. Uses big text and lots of white space. Also fills space by repeating same basic ideas over and over.Would make a good pamphlet. Don't waste your money.
2,Disappointed,"I read the reviews of this book and thought it would be a good, quick study of the Book of Revelation. I found this book to be indeed humorous as stated in a previous review but I also found the humor to be irreverent. There is nothing in this book that you cannot get with a careful, meditative study of the real thing."
4,good read.,I like the different prespectives put on the book of Revelations... you can form your own beliefs on the meaning of the book but they make it easier for you overall to understand the book of revelations and give you a variety of beliefs on it!
1,Poor and rude customer service,Phillips has one of the worst and unreliable and unfriendly customer service and i would not buy their products unless money saving is paramount and a rude and inefficient customer service is not a bother!!!
2,Sorry,"I'm sorry ,I cannot rate it since I haven't tried it yet because, its size (X-L) was bigger than my actual size(L).It is my mistake anyway.Thank you.Zaki"
5,BRITISH COMEDY NEVER GETS OLD,"The Green Man is a 50's British comedy and it still makes me laugh. Obviously dated but there is a charm in that too, especially if you were alive in the fifties as I was. I was surprised to discover that the lead (George Cole) is still acting and going strong on British TV. The story is the usual: paid killer versus innocent vacuum cleaner salesman and beautiful blond whose fiancee works for the BBC. There's a body that keeps moving from place to place and the characters at the hotel are poster material for AA. The sexual situations will probably be over the heads of young children (nothing graphic). A fun movie to watch."
2,Thick DVD?,"This has always been a favorite film of mine. I have hundreds of DVD, and only this one gets lost in my player. I have to eject it several times to get it out. I could have returned it, but realized it too late. Is it a cheap bootleg?"
5,Great Chronological Review of Biblical prophecy,This book challenges your beliefs....makes you get into the WORD and question what and why you have been taught the doctrines of your church..... make your minister and friends read it to begin a worthy discussion
3,Why SOZO?,"If I remember correctly, symbols that read like SOZO grace an early Led Zeppelin album, one of the satanically-anointed deceivers of the last (and continuing) generation. Why such a title, brother? I agree there is a need for much discernment in the church today. I find at times, as in Sunset of the Western Church, there is a kind of negative prophecy against Christ's true Bride on earth, as if His Spirit is not strong enough to fulfill every jot and tittle of the prophecies of the Word in this age of His Kingdom. Ephesians 1 clearly shows He will put all things under His feet, and do it through us. ""Fear not, little flock!"" ""Be careful what you listen to."" One can even speak sound doctrine, and yet the spirit be different than the Master. I am not accusing a brother here, but admonishing honest examination of all teaching, and consider its fruit (Mt 7; It Tim 5 - doctrine that conforms people's lives to true godliness, which is not words but power)."
3,No nut - be aware,"The main reason I ordered this is I lost the nut from my jack. Since the old jack was getting somewhat unreliable anyways I figured I would get this one as DiMarzio has a great reputation for quality stuff. There was no nut in the package. The picture clearly shows one on the jack. Had I known this, I would have gone to a local music store and bought one there. So much for the convenience of the internet. Without a nut, this is a nice looking quality jack that does me no good whatsoever. Luckily when I ordered my ToneShaper Stratocaster SSS-1, it came with a new jack including the nut.If you don't want to include an integral piece of a part, fine, state so, but don't mislead people by showing it as complete when it is not."
4,Good overview of Orwell the Writer and the Man,"This book provides a good overview of who Orwell is, in terms of both a writer and a man, in his own words. He explains why he writes, his political views and the imporance he subscribes to political writing. If you are looking to fulfill your curiosity with respect to the above no other book does it better. The only weak spot of the book (why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars) is that it has references to many historical events/facts that, unless you are a student of history (particulary Orwell's times) are not common knowledge. The editors should have placed more footnotes to assist non-students of history. If you are very knowledgeable of the history of the times, however, it should be a five star book for you."
3,Too expensive,I ordered this item on Amazon because I thought it was not available at a local retail store. After ordering I discovered it was at a local store and at half the price I paid on Amazon.
3,somewhat disappointed,"I purchased this set for my 4 year old son who loves to cook. I will say that I was quite excited to see that someone carried such a product. However, I am not all that pleased with the quality. First, I thought the apron could have been a little more ""hefty"". I have already had to re-attach the ties on the back due to poor manufacturing. Also, after the first cook and wash, I was disappointed to see the pans come out all ""rusted"". I spent a lot of time with an s.o.s. pad trying to retore them. Nonetheless, my son enjoys playing with this. I just handwash everything as soon as he's done playing with it. This is a good idea for children, I just don't think that for the quality it is worth [amt}."
4,Good for backups,"I use earnie ball strings as my backup strings. They don't have as nice and clear a tone as my d'addario or curt mangan strings, nor do they have the life expectancy, however they are cheaper and really easy to bend. Since I can't afford to restring with the more pricey strings every single time, I go with these when I'm practicing. They do break alot when I play some crazy solos, which blows, and is the main reason why I'm not giving them 5s. (No it's not my technique, I've never broken a string on any other brand strings I've tried.) When I'm in the studio recording, I prefer, like I said before, D'addario or curt mangan strings, however to save money, I practice with these strings and I think it's not a bad method, as I go through strings like doritos (I eat doritos alot)."
5,Awesome set of slinky!,"I love the way these beef up the tone when I play. Any other slinky is cool and great but the 54 and 42 really gives me the distortion a grinding tone which is awesome. My tuning is (starting with the 6th string down): Drop b, Drop F, B, E, g, c"
5,Fast delivery- Prime,"I love ernie balls strings, they are my favorite :) They came in the mail faster than expected, and I am happy to get them for such a great price."
5,Solid strings,"These 11-54's are just what my Gibson needed. The sustains are fantastic and the sounds are clear, crisp and pleasant. Some people love em, some hate em, I love em."
5,Amazing!!!!!,"This game stimulated me and fellow gamers like myself for hours on end. We were happily surprised at the game's witty challenges and the fact that everytime we played it was different from the time before. Move over Yahtzee, you have some strong competition coming your way!"
4,An average fantastic game.,"This is a fun card game that really gets your competitive blood boiling. You'll be surprised, but you know you don't want the title of ""duh/da bottom"" It surpasses anything along the lines of the classic Uno and any standard card game. BUY IT! PLAY IT! Annnd...oh, for all ages weeeeeeeeee!"
4,Well made but there are caveats to its use....,"I tried this with several drills of different powers, both corded and cordless. The primary difficulty in using this bit is that it grabs the wood so securely that, instead of going into the wood, it throws the drill! And the person holding it! It doesn't 'slide' or cut into the wood but 'digs' into it (for want of a better word). I don't think it is a design flaw but rather it is probably not meant for handheld drills. I've used bits wider than this (spade bits, for example) and other auger bits, as well as large hole saws (2 1/2"") and not had that problem with them. I returned it for a refund because I could clearly envision being injured while using it."
2,"too little, too late","I am very, very disapointed with this DVD. After waiting all these years all we get is, maybe, half the concert. Very sad. In addition the material was poorly remastered. It is a pity. We deserved more, in many ways."
2,Mistake,"How could you market this DVD and not include the beat song and performance of the night. I haven't bought this, but have to say- without Young, Petty, Dylan, Clapton, McGuinn and Harrison doing my favorite Dylan song ""My Back Pages"". I won't be buying !!!"
5,Awesome!,"If you're a fan of Dylan, Stevie, Clapton, The Band, or music in general, you have to experience this amazing night of music."
1,Disappointed,"I received my order, in good condition. However, no where in the review of this DVD did it state that this concert was not compete. Nowhere did it state that many of the songs, from the original recording (VHS) were deleted on the DVD I purchased. I expected the same concert that I purchased on VHS to be on the DVD copy I purchased through Amazon. I contacted the company that was the supplier of this DVD, but didn't get much help from them. I would not recommend doing business there."
1,"Only about half the concert, bad VHS-quality transfer","I agree with the previous reviewers. When you see the big finale number where everybody is on stage at the end, you can spot about 9 people on the stage whose individual performances were not even included. I waited all these years to see that performance of Johnny Winter doing ""Highway 61 Revisited"" again, but that was left off, apparently so they could include 15 minutes of people booing Sinead OConnor.On top of that, the video and audio quality on this DVD is more like muddy VHS."
1,I was there,"I was at this concert. I too have been waiting 20 years for an honest to goodness release of a DVD of the entire concert. Sadly the 2 CD set lacks some of the songs from the show as well. George Harrison doing ""If Not For You"" and George Thorogood did a killer song I only heard that night . I have never Bob sing it. It must be a rarity . I have almost every Dylan album and I don't know where else it could be. It reminds me a lot of Johnny Cash's ""I've Been Everywhere Man"" . It has been 20 years so some of the other songs not on the CD evade my memory. Booker T and The MGs showcased some stuff on their own. I look all the time for a DVD of the entire show. It is the one void in my extensive music collection. It was a privilege being able to see that show and have a good seat in the Garden. So , Please Bob, iron out the legal mumbo jumbo and let us own the entire show on DVD."
1,"why, oh why?","If whomever compiled this DVD didn't think he should put ""My back pages"" in it, I see no reason to buy it. Iit's one of the most important and emblematic songs in the show!"
1,Who decided which songs to include?,"I don't know, maybe there are rights issues with some of the performances that keep the suits from releasing the entire concert. OK, I can deal with that. But if one Eric Clapton song can be included, there must not be a rights issue. So why did they leave off what I consider to be the finest cover of a Dylan song in the history of Dylan music. Clapton's cover of ""Don't think twice, It's all right"" is a masterpiece. Clapton takes a pretty good folk song and turns it into an stunning blues song. I will never buy this DVD. I will watch my VHS copy until the oxide falls off."
2,This Show Had The Audience Knockin' On Heaven's Door but not this version,"I have this entire concert on Laserdisc (minus for some reason ""I'll Keep It With Mine"" by a woman singer whose name I can't remember which was on the actual concert. I've watched it many times over the past decades and it never fails to move me. There were a lot of early '80s concert and early '90s concerts which were released on VHS before the DVD appeared and I have found most of them on LaserDiscs although ironically the cheapest place to buy them has been from Japan!This show is essential watching for anyone who loves Dylan. Imagine Dylan and Roger McGuinn, Tom Petty, Neil Young (vocal and guitar solos), George Harrison (vocal), and Eric Clapton (vocal and guitar solos) backed by Booker T. & The MGs and B. T. (with Steve Cropper) and G. T. Smith (Hall & Oates) and Anton Fig on drums doing ""My Back Pages"" and you know this is not a show that will disappoint.Dylan is even thrown in for good measure."
1,Incomplete and bad quality,"This DVD was a great disppointment because: 1. It is quite an incomplete representation of the concert - only selected performances are included and it misses perhaps most of the best; and 2. the picture quality is quite poor - fuzzy images with a strange color caste. In summary, don't bother with this one."
1,Very disappointing indeed!,"I have the original version of this concert on VCR and wanted to update on DVD. This is NOT the original concert I thought it was - it is bits n pieces of it, colour and sound are terrible - it`s like a bad copy of the original - a fake. I would have returned it accept it is open, and the return policy only pays back half the cost of item, plus you are responsible for shipping. I have now ordered with my local store - the REAL version, which is 2 dvd`s, and am waiting on the arrival. I purchased this for a TRUE Bob Dylan`s fan Birthday, and he was so disappointed also. This will be thrown in garbage or perhaps recycling - what a waste of $25.00!!! Next time I will read the reviews before purchasing anything,as I am not the only one who feels this way. This should be removed from Amazon website I believe.On a positive note, I have purchased many books and other dvd`s from Amazon and am very impressed with product, and service."
1,disappointed,"I am not one to complain, but the VHS version of this Concert is much better than the DVD. Hopefully somewhere along the way someone will take the initiative to re-master and re-release a more acceptable DVD version of this Epic Event."
5,Makes me smile!,Grumpy Bear sits in my grandmother's rocking chair in my bedroom and never fails to make me smile. He is cuddly and soft. He came from Walmart and cost $40 I think so don't overspend on him. There aren't nearly enough Grumpy Bear items out there....no wonder he's so grumpy!
3,Interesting Insights.. but book has its flaws,"This is an interesting book but a little flawed. Author wishes to downplay the role of greeks in shaping of modern west and emphasize christianity, Rome and Germanic contributions, and he does offer some interesting perspectives, but the book could easily have been shorter.I didn't find an in-depth analysis of how the synthesis of christianity, rome and germanic character traits resulted in identity of west. It appeared as if author had an intuition about the same but he couldn't build a logical, detailed case out of it (It appeared more as hand-waving than convincing arguments, and repeating the idea 100 times doesn't make it a fact)But the book is still a good read for the perspective it provides on the history and development of modern world and also provides a perspective to understanding the current 'culture wars'. Overall a good read."
4,Home Improvement Book,A great closing gift for a home buyer. Get them started on the right foot! Easy to understand
2,limited information,"Out of the selection that were available, this looked like the best to go with, but was disappointed to find nothing about replacing gutters, supposedly simple process.The pictures are good though, but have not had a chance to make much use out of it."
1,The True sight of it,"When i first got the screw bit set, i opened it up, grabbed the first bit, put it in my screwdriver and tried to undo a screw. Just then, I heard a loud crack. Next thing I know,I'm laying on the ground, seering pain in my left eye. As it turns out, the bit spontaniously combusted, causing a large chunk of the bit to fly right in my eye. I then spent the next 4 hours in a waiting room, bleeding down my face, all because i wanted to undo one high security screw. I would recommend getting a different bit set, or risk losing eye sight in one eye forever."
4,Great but uneven content,"'Kellogg on Marketing' consists some excellent essays in various aspect of Marketing, but I find the content of the essays uneven. There are overlapping in topic discussed & there are also essays that are obviously abstract version of academic research. Despite the less than perfect execution, the book should be valuable & enjoyable to readers with various level of knowledge & interest in marketing."
5,Bought on a Lark!,"I'm visiting Seattle and setting off for an overnight visit to Portland. The rental has a CD player, so I picked this up for the trip. I've heard so much about this recording, and the price is right, so I gave it a try.I am amazed, period. The sound itself -- at least over these decent auto speakers -- rivals some of the best '50s mono sets I've ever heard. Ward Marston is a genius, bringing those 1938 78s to vivid life.The soprano will take getting used to -- almost disturbingly 'girlish' in her early scenes. But Gigli is incredibly good , and so is the entire cast, the orchestra, the conductor ---We live in a golden age of recordings, no doubt about that. Dipping into the past has never afforded so much pleasure."
1,More bang For The Buck,"I wonder if Oxford press will have the courage to print the truth about The Moorish prescence in Europe which formed the very foundation of the Renaissance period. I am a man of faith, and my prayer is that Prince William will finally demonstrate that Anglican academia are no longer fearful of their ture heritage."
5,Graceful and inspiring,"This is Rabbi Andrea Cohen-Kiener's interpretive translation of a mid-20th century work found buried in the rubble of the Warsaw Ghetto. Reb Kalonymous Kalman Shapira, its author, came from a long line of distinguished Hassidic rabbis, and his writings show that he lived up to his birthright. Amid the degradation within the ghetto, he was able to write a manual for transforming one's emotions and perceptions to focus on the spiritual. Rabbi Cohen-Kiener's translation makes use of contemporary spiritual vocabulary (drawn in part from the Fourth Way tradition) to make Reb Kalman's thought accessible to a wider audience."
2,Not very successful,"Unlike the title, this book is actually quite discouraging about raising pigs -- that is, breeding your own in your backyard. I gather the authors raised their own litter ONCE and decided it was so much trouble they never did it again. It's also rather dated at 24 years old.I'm going to buy the Storey Guide to Pigs, and Small Scale Pig Raising (OOP but many used available), and hope they are a better help. Meanwhile I have learned a lot from Yahoo e-groups Homestead Hogs message board, and Walter Jeffries' blog at sugarmtnfarm.com."
5,The Aftermath of Malcolm's Death,"Like The Autobiography of Malcolm X, this is also a terrific book. She writes about the aftermath of her father's death, what it was like having him as a father, how they lost their mother, her boyfriends, her sisters, their upbringing, thoughts on interracial relationships, her job, etc. She also writes about how they got closure from the death of their parents. It is a very interesting book, and I highly recommend it."
3,Don't Waste your Money,"This book fell so far from my expectations it is hard to begin explaining the things that I didn't like about this book. Ilyasah is constantly talking about herself and not really about the family as a whole. She does bring out some interesting points about Malcolm X that I didn't know, but overall I think this book is just a quick claim-to-fame type of book. I am sooooooo glad that I did not spend money on this book and I wouldn't advise anyone to purchase this. Please check it out if possible."
5,Inspirational Legacy,"As a student of the Malcolm X school of thought, I have often wondered what it would be like to have met Malcolm the private friend, husband and father. Growing Up X provides a brief, but insightful look at Malcolm, the family man whose intense love captured and sustained his beloved wife Betty for more than three decades after his death. Malcolm's omnipresence in the lives of his wife and daughters was a deliberate plan of Dr. Shabazz who once told her daughter, ""I had DE best man."" It is of this ""best man"" and his inspirational legacy that Ilyasah gives a glimpse. In line with her father's teachings, she motivates and inspires us to be our best. Ilyasah stands fully poised to inherit the legacies of her parents and to carry on the baton of human rights and justice. This very thoughtful and warm book engrossed me from beginning to end and I eagerly look forward to reading her upcoming book that will provide a deeper look at her parent's life."
3,"Humble, Yet Ungreatful","The author wrote a good book for the most part, yet came off to me as little ungreatful. I am refering to the inference about the movie based on the life of her Father, MALCOLM X.In writing, ""Denzel Washington did a good job but, my father was....Come now Ms. Shabazz, Spike Lee did not have time to cast a clone of your father.Lee did the best that he could to convey the power of your father's works as well as his life.Your own mother was the creative consultant on the film!A little thankfulness goes a long way considering the type of activist that your father was.In his early days as a leader of the NOI, he angered many black and white people with the wording and the tone of his speeches and not too many directors were chomping at the bit to produce a film honoring Malcolm X.Next time spend your own money and YOU do the research and t ake the time to create a movie about your dad."
2,Fell Shory of Expectations,"This was a very dry, perfunctory piece of work. Nothing new or interesting revealed. In fact the book boiled down to Ms. Shabazz expressing the equivalent of ""look at me! I'm Malcolm X's daughter. I'm my mother's favorite child. Aren't I great!"" I was sorely disappointed. I would have liked to know more about her sisters as well but she craftily kept them at bay. I highly recommend the Autobiography of Malcolm X and any collection of his speeches to get a real understanding of the man. By-pass this work unless you're just looking for someone who's stroking her own ego and basking in the fame and accomplishments of her parents."
5,Growing is by no means easy!,"I felt the book was very insightful. The whole world probably wanted to know how Malcolm X's children faired after is death. They deserved the good education and the care that their mother gave them or that the world could give them. I applaud Betty for it. I disagree with one review which said she was all over the place in the book or went from one thing to another. I believe she is remembering as a two year old and we've got to think of it from that prospective. We should expect them to have lived a sheltered life, but it seemed as though Ilyasah tried to break the mold but couldn't.(smile) I am proud that she had the courage to write about her private life. My mom was a great follower of Malcom X and even took my brother to his funeral. We will all forever miss her mother and father. I too think that they are together now in peace."
4,review,"easy to install, sounds good wish i could of found more specs on the 1watt/1meter which lanzar doesnt seem to provide but clean and crisp...install in my g6 with monsoon and used the passive crossovers no issues sounds great but since there seems to be be a difference in the 1watt/1meter spec than my back speakers ive had to fade out the rears to match the fronts"
3,Camo Bedding Set,"The comforter is excellent, my son loved it. However the material that the sheet set is made from does not wash well. I washed it the first time and it looks as if it has been washed 10 times. It does not retain shape well either."
4,Excellent - Despite the rambling vocals,"I liked LTJ's music alot but MC Conrad's ""rapping"" got to be a bit annoying after a while. Fortuneatly, Conrad's routine does'nt overshadow the great sounding music."
4,Jerusalem Bible Saints Edition,"A good supplement to my Catholic Study Bible with appropriate prayers and meditations from the saints of the church related to various parts of scripture. Would not be useful as an only Bible, however, as it lacks extensive footnotes and commentaries but fits my purpose as a second translation and prayer guide to the New American Bible (study) I use as my main source."
5,As Described; Works Great!,"This drive does all that it is supposed to. It is faster and larger than my old drive, so it made a nice upgrade to my Windows XP system."
4,Nice table very solid,"The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the packaging. Honestly it only had a thin cardboard box wrapped around it and the box was practically falling apart when it arrived. Fortunately the table and all the pieces were intact. The assembly was very easy although you need an extra set of hands to help hold the ""dowels"" in place while you screw. I made a mistake with the height of the table which ended up being a little too low for the bar chairs. This is a solid, heavy piece of furniture. It comes pretreated with oil but I decided to add some - I am hoping it will last for a long time."
4,Just like I remembered it...,This CD was purchased to replace an old tape production. This fits the bill. It arrived as promised and in exact condition advertised.
4,The Murder of Thomas Becket at Canterbury,"""Murder in the Cathedral"" is T.S. Eliot's dramatization of the murder of Thomas Becket. Because the tale is told in verse, historical accuracy is sacrificed. While some may appreciate this element, I would prefered the story to be closer to reality. Though the chorus may be a fabulous part of the dramatization in person, the flow of the story seems to ebb in a negative stream in these extended passages while reading.The story of Thomas Becket is quite inspiring, yet I feel I would be misleading reviewers by saying it is here. The basic plot is accurate. King Henry II believes that Thomas Becket's meddlesome ways are undermining the king's rule. The poetic lines show a writer in his element. Though I feel the story was compromised in the process."
3,"meh, not a bad speaker, not the best","i installed these into the lift gate of my cherokee and wired them to an amplifier, over all the sound quality isnt bad but would probably work better wired directly to the head unit since less power is put through the speakers. overall not too bad though"
5,3.5mm audio ext cable,"Well built, no surprises - How nice, ussually you never receive what was advertised!!! Wish there was a shorter cable, I only needed 36"".Great service, product arrived in 3 days, which was very good."
5,3.5MM Extension Cable,This product is very good. It's worked great since the day I started using it. I would highly recommend this product.
2,"Nice table, but the wood quality leaves much to be desired","I liked the mission style of these tables. They arrived quickly and were easy to put together, but the wood quality leaves much to be desired for the price that this company charges. Its got a lot of varnish on it to make it shiny. Not nice oak like the photo depicts. If that is ok for you, great product. If you wanted something more towards mission - pass on this. I would send it back, but they clearly state that it must be sent back in orginial packaging and there is no way all those parts are going back inside the packing!"
4,"Handy tables, style I wanted.","We put in new carpet,bought a sofa and a recliner for my husband with a craftsman look, wooden arms and sides. I looked and looked for nesting tables. We have a weekly Bible study and bring in folding chairs. These chairs end up too far away from tables to set a coffee cup down. With these, I can pull the two smaller ones out and place them where they are available for my friends. The tops of the tables are a little disappointing. Didn't notice the grooves along the top edges in the pictures prior to shipment. Not so fond of those. One chip on a corner, but a little stain covered it. For the cost, these were a good buy for my need."
4,Look good in our room,"Tables seem to be well made but the finish could be better, but they can't be beat for the price."
4,too creative for radio,"CROW * Operation KAP (Grapetree, 1999)Bruthaz Grimm member, CROW, embarks on his debut solo project with a mission to shine the light on the world of pimps and prostitution. A former pimp himself, CROW, deals with a character named ""Sylvia"" throughout the project, showing her downward spiral and eventual attempt towards redemption. This is hardcore, but a different kind of hardcore ... Parents listen first, that you may be able to discuss it with your teen. But this is a little too hard for kids under the age of 13. Parental discretion is definitely advised.LaZeric Fridell Freeman"
4,"This is the great and very interesting book to read. So for your great experience, pls. try it as soon.","This is the great and very interesting book to read. So for your great experience, pls. try it as soon.:-)"
5,"Very, Very Nice!","This is an easy to read, feel-good-about-golf book. Buy it, read it, take its message to the course with you. Non-mechanical adjustments to your game and your attitude about your game. One of the better ""mental approach"" golf books."
3,mongolian for beginners,"Quite good in the way it allows you to practise your vocabulary, but only if you've studied how to pronounce the cyrilic words beforehand. You can print off the lists of words and then gradually become better at listening and learning. It's limited to a few basic sentences and a small vocabulary though, and has no information on grammatical structure etc."
5,Groundbreaking work.,"A beautiful, graceful masterpiece which takes you through the entire human emotional spectrum. From its raging highs to melancholic lows, listening to Mr. Beast is a cathartic experience, much like watching an epic film.It belongs up there with some of modern history's greatest emotional albums, such as Pink Floyd's The Wall."
2,music to pet your cat to,"There's really not much to say about this album, and that's the biggest problem with it. It's not really heavy. It's not really light. It's not really happy. It's not really sad. This album just sort of exists. After purchasing, I listened to Mr. Beast for about a week before moving on to other things. The first three tracks tend to hold your interest, but after that it's a struggle. The rest of the album is just a large bland blur of piano and distorted guitar.I have kept coming back to Mr. Beast, hoping that I was wrong about this album, but each repeated listen just makes me hate it a little more. If you look at the reviews here, even the more positive ones tend to stop at 4 stars. There is just nothing tangible about this album to hold on to.Maybe if you are slightly doped up on valium Mr. Beast will hold some value for you, but for most people this is simply safe, ignorable background music."
2,funny,"this album seems like a bit of a joke if you ask me, mogwai are probably laughing it up right now. I cant believe the number of people on here praising this album to the high heavens, maybe its their first mogwai record, who knows. But what I do know is that there are many parts on this album that are quite dull and unimaginitive, sounds somewhat like a band that is running out of ideas. it sounds like an inferior version of rock action or happy songs. glasgow megasnake is the only track that did anything for me."
5,Mogwai Unleashes a Beast!,"Mogwai has returned with easily some of their best work. This album is phenomenal. There is something for every Mogwai fan in this effort, it ranges from calming, dreamy soundscapes to the punishing wall of sound in Glasgow Mega-Snake and We're No Here. Any fan of Mogwai or those post-rock fans who have never heard of them, which frankly I find to be impossible, need to experience this work of art. My only complaint is that it ends too quickly."
4,Mr. Tortoise?,"Mogwai's latest finds them venturing into Tortoise territory, which is not a bad thing, but much of Mogwai's loud/soft dynamics are not present on Mr. Beast. Still, as has been said before, mediocre Mogwai is still light years ahead of most other music coming out these days. Definitely worth a listen."
2,oh what happened gwai?,"With all the hype that surrounded with this release I was expecting for Mogwai to unleash their most powerful album yet. Especially since we were told that the sound was a return to their early noisy, guitar-based sound, this is true to a certain extent, but it is also misleading. I think this album just lacks any sort of real punch in the face or heart, there are few nice moments, but thats it, overall it seems a bit too scattered (like many Mogwai albums) it seems like these guys dont know whether they want to turn up the amps and rock out, or do the typical slowish post-rock song, the combination of both worked well on ""Young Team"" and ""Come On Die Young"" but with this album it seems like the overall vision is a bit blurry. The highlights are ""Friend Of The Night"" and ""Glasgow Megasnake"". These guys are still a tremendous live band and I would definetly recommend seeing them live, since that is where they truly shine."
2,I should have listened to my husband...,The book is funny and for that fact only do I give it 2 stars instead of one. But I hadn't bought it for its entertainment value. My husband thinks the book was written by one or more guys who sat around and had an idea on how to make money... I think I agree with him.Let me be blunt: it didn't work for us. If you are curious and have the money to blow (pun intended) give it a try but if you are even slightly hesitant about whether it's the right book for you or not then DON'T buy it. And DON'T buy the video either. That really is a waste of money!!!! I'm speaking from experience here.
1,"Catching Title, No Delivery","This book reads exactly like a porn novel. It offers nothing educational and nothing new. I should have been suspicious about exaggerating words like ""You will master the greatest power on earth"" or ""9 Free Secrets of ..."" If you search onAmazon.com, you'll find Clint Arthur authored 3 other books. Two of them have the title begins with ""Free...."" And yet they all cost money. They're not free! It's good marketing but useless writing.I gave my copy to a charity secondhand store."
5,smart shopper,This smells great. I bought it for my husband starting 2yrs ago and he gets so many compliments. This time I got it for my nephew andhe thinks it is one of the best smelling colognes.
5,very nice perfume recommended,"this perfume is good, great product love kenneth cole producsti recommended buying this one.. or atleast try it u wont regret"
5,A splendid book,"DK Publishing has created a splendid book. The text by historian David Rubel is wonderfully written and very moving. The book is perhaps the best single full account of the momentous civil rights revolution from 1954 to 1968. And the combination of text and pictures in The Coming Free is breathtaking: one beautifully designed spread after another, each with amazing (and often rare) photographs. You can't help turning the pages. Rubel has also filled the book with dozens of short essays, many of them biographies of key figures. In short, The Coming Free seems a breakthrough book for DK: it signals a far higher quality of text, pictures, and their integration than DK has done before. Kudos to Rubel and DK."
5,A lot of Black History for your coffee table!,It's a well done event driven historical reference. Everyone who has looked in it has been impressed. If you are a history buff I - add it to your collection.
4,Necessity with the Cat-It Waterer,"Firmly holds the whole unit, and I don't have to worry about my hardwood floors. Keeps the mess contained should my little guy decide to splash around or 'play' with his food."
5,Great addition,"I don't know why some people say it does not ""fit"" with the CatIt drinking fountain, mine is a perfect fit. The notches are designed to hold it in place and are snug against the fountain so it does not move.The mat also protects what the fountain is on so any water that leaks out (unless your pet is very messy!) stays on the mat and will dry up (or use a towel / paper towel to dry it).If you have the fountain I recommend this. The only drawback is that it has a bit of a larger footprint than the fountain - but if you have the room it will help protect what the fountain is on."
5,This thing is awesome!,"I would love to tell you all what a great product it is, but i can't seem to get my kids off of it long enough to check it out myself. They love all the animations and pictures. It is a terrific way to get young kids interested. They watch the animations over and over and then ask questions about it, it just gets the whole discussion started."
3,A Bit Clunky by Today's standards,"but what does today really know? Robert Lowell's first book of poems, Lord Weary's Castel, is dense with allusion and firmly situated in time, place, and even space. The collection is full of references to the American New England tradition, especially in its Puritan and Maritime manifestations. As such many of the poems have an arcane, lurching sensibility, perhaps an attempt on Lowell's behalf to recreate the laconic moral world view of Old New England. This is a challenging set of poems to read. They are not sparkling or new in there use of language and/or of aesthetic viewpoint; readers should approach these poems with sleeves rolled up and get ready to work at giving them meaning."
3,Lifespan too short,"I placed the order on Amazon and the seller was Medexsupply.We received the goods in July with a experation date of April 2012.The lifespan is too short, but the seller doesn't allow an exchange for the same item with a longer lifespan.At least one year is prefered."
3,Not as good as Thayer's later novels,"This book is one of Nancy Thayer's earlier novels. I enjoyed reading it, although the main character seemed rather superficial at times. She also seems to fall into bed rather easily with some of the men in the novel with no consequences. The flower shops setting and her drive to succeed in spite of obstacles in her path are the best parts. She suffers from the coldness of her parents early in the story, but good luck and a good friend almost immediately prevent her from being too miserable. As long as you aren't looking for the depth of character in her later books, you'll be content."
5,Inspirational,"Nancy Thayer's book, Everlasting, was inspirational to me, just as her other books have been. Thayer is a wonderful, passionate womanist who subtly embraces feminity and the marvelous, complicated aspects of our yin energy. She writes about strong women who recognize that we find joy and fulfillment in areas other than romance and passionate love affairs. In this novel, she reminds us to be true to our nature: strong, expressive and goal oriented; and by being our true selves (and not the submissive, dansel in distress we appear to be in many romance novels) and honoring every aspect of our Self, by focusing on the other important aspects of our lives, instead of only on our need for male companionship, we can attract true love, a man who truly champions us. REW"
2,Durability lacking,"I purchased Dewalt because ""it's what contractors use"". I used this mandrel with a few hole saws to install a raised air intake on my truck, and the mandrel screw couldn't stand up to drilling through the British ""aluminium"" body of my Land Rover. I ended up having to go out and buy another brand's mandrel and hole saw to complete the install. The saw blades themselves held up admirably, and I may end up buying additional Dewalt mandrels just to continue using them. If not for that, I wouldn't buy them again."
5,Fast and very secure,Allows for very easy change of sizes and design keeps the bit very secure with no slippage vs the cheaper design that use a lock nut
3,works better than other of this type,"We have used the Bosch quick change arbors and found that they break and having to use only Bosch pilot bits was not great. The DeWalt are pretty good and make a good connection with most of my bi-metal hole saws, though loose on some compared to a standard 2-pin hole saw arbor. It is a 5/8"" thread so it only can be used on the large sizes of hole saws. The 1/4"" pilot bit has a special tip that keeps it from walking when drilling a hole in metal.We just bought some of the new Blue Boar dual arbor adapter kits and want to start using them so we can use a single arbor for all the sizes of hole saws we use on projects."
4,tuneful fun,"I enjoyed this version of Pinafore a lot, but have some qualms about the casting of Frankie Howerd. Not a perfect Pinafore, but a very good one."
2,Bad singing by Captain and no singing by Admiral,This review's title says it all. It is incredible that non-singers were cast in such important roles.
2,A little disappointing,"Perfectly fine performances, BUT... this version was filmed on a sound stage for a PBS television production (rather than a live performance.) The result is a rather sterile feel. I much prefer the Opera Australia version with Anthony Warlow, David Hobson, and Colette Mann (which was filmed during a live stage performance.) The applause, laughter and audience reactions make it far more enjoyable than this PBS version."
1,Worst ever,"I have seen several versions of HMS Pinafore, as well as stage productions. This version is horrible. My family groaned and started leaving. I left when they murdered 'A British Tar'. I thought my son was sticking it out but he had simply fallen asleep. Costumes and acting poor, singing even worse. The play started off badly and tapered off from there. Don't buy this one."
2,Don't waste your money!,"I was very disapointed with this production. I rate it 1 level above a high school production. It was very amateurish and Peter Marshall made like a Jackie Gleason in hamming it up. The voices and chorus were not bad, but the bad acting distracted from the enjoyment one should get from Pinafore"
2,"OK, but:","The product was in tip top shape and it came promptly. THe seller did great. I was a little disappointed in the production, no fault of the seller. I had seen a peppier production on PBS years ago and I thought this production would be equally entertaining. D'Oily Carte is a little stiff."
2,H M S Pinafore,It really should have been subtitled I could understand very few songs. This was a bad production in many ways. The dancers were clumsey and fell without anyone editing it out. There were awkward pauses between numbers. The 1st Lord didnt sing his song he talked it. Poor little Butter cup was hardly little. and finally very disappointed with Peter Marshall's mincing around. I would like a better version
1,"BAD, BAD, BAD!","Do not waste your money on any of the Opera World series. I bought a VHS series of six Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, and I am SO sorry I wasted my money. I grew up on Gilbert and Sullivan (they were one of my mother's favorites) and these productions are a slap in the face to these two geniuses."
1,Living proof that TV personalities don't belong onstage!,"SPARE YOURSELF THIS EXPERIENCE!Much as I adore Gilbert & Sullivan, and could even tolerate The Hollywood Squares quiz show once upon a time, I can't figure out why anyone thought Peter Marshall would be able to contribute to a G&S; production. And sure enough, he couldn't.In fact, his presence is one of the many downfalls of this production, which include mediocre choreography, a poorly designed set, unconvincing personalities, and some truly bizarre camera work. It's difficult to even sit through this embarrassing production once. You'll be better off catching a local amateur production."
3,Frankie Speaking,"A ""liberal"" interpretation of the holy texts, but with many nice touches. To my mind the big issue is the casting of Frankie Howerd as Sir Joseph. Howerd was a stand-up comic from a bygone era and was a sort of likeable clown. (Americans might think of Redd Foxx.) I enjoyed seeing Howerd's over-the-top hamming and mugging but many will not. He is no singer, and does a sort of ""Rex Harrison"" with his songs."
2,An Absurd Attempt,"A video only a mother could love.I've heard the original D'Oyly Carte records of most G&S operettas and seen the D'Oyly Carte videotape of ""The Mikado"". I was hoping to get a better look at the stagings of these operettas by looking in the ""Opera World"" series.Bad idea. The staging for this is just absurd and the captain is overplayed while Sir Joseph Porter doesn't even sing. Everybody's dancing around the stage like a fool and destroying what little is left of G&S these days.Sullivan would be pleased because his music is performed beautifully. With the exception of Sir Joseph, the vocal aspect of the video is great. If only it came on CD...Gilbert would be astonished, ashamed, and confounded at how horrible his clever production became in the hands of these hacks. If you're a true G&S fan, you'll wince at this ridiculous staging."
1,Save your money,"This is only good for a person who has never performed anything ever in your life.The advice is as follows:listen to the music you are going to dance todecide if you are going to do choreography or improvelook at the audience without starring at themwell duh.Worst video ever!!And during the relaxation ""exercise"" she messes up in what she is saying.Take to and edit - Hello!I have never learned less form anything everSAve your money - go get a nice lunch, throw it in the trash, give it to a charity, anything is better!"
5,MJ is raqin' the casbah!,"There really isn't enough good things to say about Michelle Joyce's Secrets of the Stage videos. She has combined a generous helping of valuable hard-earned experience and advice with professional and creative editing/production. The video includes live performance segments with analysis and pointers from the dancers themselves as well as interviews and guidance from Michelle. This is easily a $50 value, but she is offering it at a price that most aspiring dancers can afford. Bravo MJ on another great production!"
1,Secrets of trying to watch this!!!!,"The only way I can watch this DVD is to put it in my laptop and spend quite a bit of time clicking, clicking, and clicking again on the individual chapters. I'm assuming it's because this was recorded on a DVD-R disk. I have not been able to play it in my two-year-old DVD player, nor will it play automatically in any of my computers through media player. Once I've had an opportunity to watch the whole thing, I'll get back to this page and give it a review on the contents."
3,Pretty,"This DVD is a pretty DVD. The dancers are pretty, their routines are pretty. If that is what you want, you may be pleased with this. Be warned that you are paying for a lot of black screen, as the screen is black for the duration of the relaxation exercise and the improvisation exercise. There is much talk of what to do, yet I find myself asking, ""Okay, are you going to tell the student HOW to do what you just told her to do?"" The DVD also did not play in the standard manner on my computer. I had to try 3 different ways of playing it to get it to finally play(that could be solely my fault, as I am not used to all the computer stuff). Other than that, it is well put-together."
3,it's okay.,I think this dvd was okay. It was just that. I can't even say anything exciting about it.
5,Inverter Review,I was looking for a cost effective device to allow me to watch the TV news in my motorhome when we didn't have access to 120 volt AC power. It is small and powerful enough to accomplish that. I am satisfied with the purchase.
3,Highly realistic fiction,"I liked Straydog but some things at the end of the book prevent me from giving it a higher rating. This is a very good story about what happens at many animal shelters but might be a little too realistic for some younger readers, because the dog in the book is also a feral/wild dog. For older readers it is a good and realistic fiction story"
5,An engaging read through and through!,"The characters were were deep and relateable, and the story made you want to contiue to read until the end than read again."
5,Making learning Fun...,"I throughly enjoyed this book! I scan puzzles from time to time and print them out to take them with me, this way I can use the book as often as I like. A nice addition to my libray."
3,A little difficult to keep the games in.,This product does its job: it holds four games. I do have a complaint though. I have found it very difficult to keep the games in the case. They always seem to pop out every time I open the case. This is very annoying to me as they usually end up on the floor or on my lap and I have to put the games back in. They can also be a little tricky to get them in in the first place. I don't think I'd recommend this product to others.
4,Great Kit - Lots of Learning,"My 5-year old really enjoyed this set of experiments. Each kit is packaged separately and contains most of the items you need to conduct the experiments. What wasn't included was noted at the beginning of the instructions and was readily available; items like water and baking soda. Some of the experiments in kit 8 did not produce immediate results, but he had a great time checking to see how much his crystals grew. Plus, he loved eating the rock candy that we made following the instructions in kit 8. I gave it 4 stars because in kit 7, you are given rocks of varying hardness and you give it a hardness score based upon what scratches it or what it scratches. There was only supposed to be one rock that was hard enough to scratch glass, but it looked like a couple of the rocks did. But overall the kits are great and produce results as expected."
5,Our Grandson Loved It!,"This was a Christmas present for our 7 yr old grandson. His comments were "" this is awesome, I am very interested I this subject"". His mom had picked it out for us to order and he couldn't have been happier."
5,brilliant,"i, also, saw this just last night on CBC. it was absolutely brilliany, i tell you. you must see it. i do hope to see it, and read it, again. it is just one of those things that you get it the first time, but you keep on wanting to watch it. it makes you feel...i don't know. it depends on what you've lived in life and all.but seriously, go see it. or read it. whatever. just DO it. nike..argh. nike sucks."
4,Solid and Heavy Product...,"I think I have about six PC headsets. These are big and heavy but feel solid. I wouldn't travel with them but if you need a headset to block out noise in your location, stop looking. Once you put these on, they're the ultimate in ""noise cancellation"". They totally enclose your ears and really allow you to focus on the conversation. I primarily use these for Skype and I'm pleased with the purchase. Although USB would have been a better choice for me. I haven't used these for music so hard to evaluate. If you have an older style PC or are deciding against the USB options for whatever reason, these would be a solid choice"
2,"Great mic, terrible audio","I got these to use a language software (Chinese, using Rosetta Stone software). The microphone works great for voice recognition on RS, but the audio quality is so poor I have difficulty understanding the spoken words. I have gone back to a pair of super-cheapo headphones and will wait until I find a better headset for the language software.Bottom line, if sound quality is an issue at all, stay away from this headest (music quality was also worse than my $5.99 specials)"
4,It was a great book to learn about him but it made me think.,"O.K. I think Prince William is cute and this book was great in that it gave me good pictures and info. But it also made me think. He's just a normal teenager,trying to live his life. It sort of made me feel bad that I got this book. Like I was envading his privacy. I guess all I want to say is that if your going to get a book about William please don't get an unofficial biography. Think about it, how would you feel (someone saying stuff that sometimes isn't true)? I really can't express my feelings any better."
1,Another rip-off,"I don't know why I don't just give up on Dr. Rosenfeld's books. He simply gathers together information that we already know, if we read, that is. Dr. Rosenfeld reminds me of Milton Berle, he never met someone else's work he didn't love."
5,"Ann Landers says, ""Read it and reap""","Quoting from the 6/8/99 Seattle P-I Ann Landers column, this book ""tells you the truth about aging -- the hard facts as well as the good news. ...You will be told in detail, how to accelerate your energy level, how to deal with cancer and strokes, osteoporosis and heart disease, as well as what to do about deafness and failing eyesight. This book is written in simple language and lets you know that you are the key player in the aging game."" Ann Lander does not recommend books frivolously, and she says, ""Run, don't walk, to your favorite [independently owned] bookstore immediately...and ask that a copy be held for you."""
3,Beginner cooking,This is a great little book for the batchelor or young bride. But be sure to buy the low sodium soups.
1,I should have listened to R. Sharon's review!,"I cannot state my review any more clearly than the previous reviewer. Unfortunately, I did not believe it. ""How could Adaptec put the wrong plug on this power cord?"", I thought to myself. So I went ahead and purchased, and boy do I feel stupid. R. Sharon was correct. The Adaptec card needs a 3.5 mm outside plug, and this power cord comes with a 5.5 mm outside. Do not buy!!!"
2,Absolute,"I thought the cards were going to be great, but I didn't receive 1 game autographed card. The jersey cards were neat, but in all honesty, I probably only received $20.00 worth of cards when I spent $50.00 for the box. But like usual, Absolute memorabilia flourishes again, taking advantage of the buyer. I rate this product a C-"
5,Tasty & Healthy,"These SBD protein bars are very tasty for a protein bar. They're like a dense rice-crispy treat with with cranberries and almonds mixed in. I think they're perfect for a healthy snack, energy during a longer workout, or if you eat two of them with a piece of fruit, a very good light meal. They have about 10 grams of protein each, which is really good considering they're only 35g bars. They also have a good deal of fiber, are low in sugar, and have very little fat. They are smaller than many other protein bars, so bear in mind that they are NOT meal replacement bars unless you eat more than one of them. I actually prefer thePeanut Butterflavor, but it's nice to have some variety.Nutrition FactsServing Size: 1 Bar (35.0 g)Calories: 140Calories from Fat: 45Total Fat: 5.0gSaturated Fat: 2.0gSodium: 160mgTotal Carbohydrates: 15.0gDietary Fiber: 3.0gSugars: 6.0gProtein: 10.0gVitamin A 15% * Vitamin C 0%Calcium 15% * Iron 10%"
4,So far so good,Item arrived quickly - was a Christmas gift for my son. He loved it - said it was easy to install. Time will tell I suppose.
1,Too OLD!!,Shame on me for not checking the copywright on this book before I bought it...it is a little old to be using for my first trip to Cabo! Will look closer next time!
4,Amanda loves it,Amanda is Three and loves her Ryans room doll house the extras are great I alsways know what to get her for a gift
2,Cheap!,"I was very disappointed when I receivced this item, I will be returning it. I bought this as a gift for my mother who collects crystal. I don't even know if this really is crystal, it feels more like hardened plastic. It is very cheap looking and feeling and considering it's size is not worth the $35.00 charged."
5,Nice little rose,I bought this for my wife on our 15th anniversary. When it got knocked over and broke 2 years later I had to get a new one as soon as possible. We have it sitting on a window ledge in our kitchen where the evening sun hits it causing it to look fantastic. A very nice item.
2,Not for the Young,"I got this for my girlfriend. It had some ""sweet"" connotations but she did NOT love it. Her mom asked if she could re-gift it to some co-worker. Basically, this item is for old people, wouldn't recommend it under age 35. Or, maybe my girlfriend and her parents are eastern European and that is why. Who knows. It looked nice and romantic to me, then again, I'm a guy. Go figure."
2,A distant 2nd to the original,This re-recording of John Barry's original score from the movie Born Free falls well short of the original soundtrack. Its been many years since I last heard the original on LP but one thing became clear after listening to this newest effort. The re-recording comes across as being bland and sterile compared to the original and the choice of drums used as an accompaniment in some of the songs just doesn't work at all while in the original the drums blended perfectly with the orchestra as well as the culture. On the good side the new version does include some additional material not in the original. Overall this re-recording is a mildly enjoyable album despite its failings but hopefully someone in the powers that be will remaster the original soundtrack which I consider to be the very best work of John Barry not to mention among the finest movie soundtracks past or present.
2,"""Original"" Score?","What a disappointment, receiving my eagerly awaited Born Free ""Original Score"" and seeing the 1999 re-recording date on the back - and indeed, this is a rather passionless, soulless thing. Musicians simply going through the motions. And no Matt Munro! Somebody deserves a punch in the mouth for this."
3,Get out your worn out Sound Track,"I was disappointed in the re-do of Barry's classic soundtrack. Yes, the songs are the same but the arrangements just aren't up to the standard of Barry's original. Also missing is the Matt Monroe vocal of Born Free. Too bad!"
5,re-recording of Born Free soundtract,"The music is beautiful. However, it does not have the vocal of the main title. I would suggest owning both versions, the original 1966 with the vocal, and the2000 re-recording. Both are beautiful. But, I was disappointed when I played this version and there was no vocal. I quickly ordered the 1966 version. The 2000 version is a beautiful recording in itself, even without the vocal."
3,Whoops,Whoops! I just submitted a review to Born Free and then realized that mis-spelled Matt Munro's name in the review. Could you please change it from Monroe to Munro? Thanks
3,"Brilliant papyrologist, Not as brilliant a literary critic.","The late D.L. Page's talents were certainly in creating solid, serviceable texts, such as his work with Aeschylus, the Poetarum Lesbiorum Fragmenta, etc. His exegesis of textual problems in this text is still remarkably useful, and provides the scholar with adequate information to proceed in an informed manner when working with the text. As far as a literary critic, Page has always been less than creative, looking at things with a rather prosaic lense. His interpretation of Alcaeus fr. 357 (LP Z34, V 140) is foolishly literal, and fails to contribute anything to the understanding of the piece. His wide reading and abilities with the language itself more than make up for his shortcomings, making this an essential book to have for suggestions that point the reader towards parallel passages, and as survey of the textual corruption/emendation in the selection of poems contained within."
4,A Quick escape,"A wonderful reinactment of experiences that most us of have had. Working under an overpowering and manipulative boss, another associate that pretends to be someone they are not. and a time to escape it all and lose oneself in the fabulous river walk! this writing pair have put it all together. there is romance, a bit of suspense with a surprise ending. Everything to keep you reading until the very end. I couldn't put it down until I finished the entire book!Looking forward to the next book by this dynamic duo!"
4,WALK ON----,"I enjoyed this first effort by the mother and daugher team of Stompe and Neese. I found myself involved with the very believable characters as they struggle to come to terms with everyday life. From the frustrations in the work place to the lure of extramarital romance, the authors lead you through a wide range of emotions as the characters grow and mature. Although not the typical ""happily-ever-after"" ending the book ends on a positive note. Let's hope we hear more from this talented pair."
5,Great Marriage Builder,"This CD set is excellent. Jimmy Evans uses humor and stories to portray his point on many marriage-related topics: loving a wife, loving a husband, dealing with step families, finding common ground on finances. He's extremely easy to listen to. Some of the scripture references that he uses may be stretching the biblical point, in my opinion, but his point is well taken. He's never ""preachy."" I purchased an additional set to give to my newly married son and his wife. I highly recommend this to every married couple."
1,This book isn't enough to undertand the subject,This book isn't enough to undertand the subject. I recommend try to find the more complete book.
1,"Its short, but that's a good thing!","From the moment I picked up this book I had my doubts. First because it seemed awfully thin. But after reading through about a third of it, and not believing that it was really as bad as it seemed, I resolved to read the whole thing. I figured that it had to get better. That at some point the author would get around to talking about project management instead of suggesting silly mind games that supposedly impress others.By the time I finished I was ""extreme"" in my thanks the book was so short, so that my misery came to a quick end.Apparently ""extreme"" also means that there is not enough time for even basic proof reading.In the very first chapter the author talks about people who just don't understand his techniques and that they are sadly misguided. I'd have to agree, but the only thing these folks can be accused of being misguided about was paying $12.95 for this book."
4,WAAAAY OUT THERE,"I read the book with a skeptic's eye, based on the mixed review this book has been getting from all around the world. I did pick up some interesting points. Although, the meshed-in look of the book, with the absurd ""ideas"" for Project Manager is not very realistic, I think the book has a solid ground on theoritical aspects.I liked very much the Review Techniques, as I can completely relate to it, and it is nice to have some advice on the ""people"" perspective.All in all, I can;t say that this is the best book on Project Management, but if you lay your prejudjments aside, it can be a very very interesting read.Patrick J.London 2004"
1,Do not waste your time,This is a complete waste of money and time. This guy has no credible recommendations. He hasn't a clue as to what xtreme PM is.
2,holiday remix misconceived,"Sadly this is a feeble flop, a, failed attempt to pump new energy into old but proven classics . . .Ick!!"
1,DIDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL,"i was very disappointed in this product. i had to click a star to rate it, but i didn't even want to click one star."
2,Disappointed in the condition of this book,"The front cover has clearly been bent with the bottom third heavily creased. Likewise, the entire book feels used and shabby. I am still glad to have it but would have selected a much better condition text."
5,Best way to make math fun,"It's lots of fun. It helped me learn math. Every time you mess up you then get the right answer, and that makes it easier to remember the next time. At first I hated math but now I like doing math on the Math Shark. It makes me more confident about math and my ability to learn new math skills. I am almost 10 and I recommend you buy this."
4,Great product,"This works like advertised. It does a good job of drilling a wide variety of the basic math facts. It has a very wide range of ages that it would be useful for. I did have some issue with the screen seeming a little difficult to get the clearest image on but my daughter (who uses it) says she has no problems. We made a chart for each number and when she can get the addition or subtraction set done within a certain time frame, she can cross it off and stop practicing it. We found this motivated her greatly to practice on her own to get her times down. On to multiplication/division!"
3,Math Shark,"I think the product is effective for reinforcing math facts with the various levels. One criticism I would put forth is that you must choose the number you wish to drill (e.g., addends +9) instead of having a random feature that would review all addition facts, for example at a given level. The numbers are sometimes difficult for younger ones to discern given the very rudimentary graphics. Overall, I would recommend the product because it does drill to mprove math skills quite simply, without a lot of fluff."
1,screen is a real problem,I really wanted to like this. The screen is just so sub par. The kids will pull it out occasionally to use as a calculator but that's only because they don't have another one. However bad you think the screen might be it is probably worse. This quality of screen would have been complained about by reviewers 20 years ago because it does cut things off and make them unreadable. Today it makes no sense to sell a screen like this when people are use to so much better. Also a rubber button promptly fell off and is still floating around the house somewhere.
3,An additional way to drill math facts,"My 8 year old doesn't mind using this a few times a week. They do a lot of math drills in school, but she was getting stuck. This is a different way for her to practice, in addition to old-fashioned paper and pencil. The screen is difficult to see if you are not right in front of it (I can't watch over her shoulder), but she says she can see it just fine."
1,"Bought 2, neither worked","I was very excited when I heard about this product. I thought it would be a great toy for car rides and of course would help reinforce basic math concepts. I purchased one and the top row of buttons did not work. Amazon immediately sent a new one and it had the SAME problem. I am sure it is a great product, but keep your receipt and try it out! For two to have the exact same problem there must be an entire batch that was made incorrectly."
2,Low res screen,Math Shark's low resolution screen discourages kids from using it. Compared to any other game I rate the screen for Math Shark the worst.
2,Screen Needs a Backlight!!!!,Not sure why more reviewers didn't mention the fact that the numbers are very difficult to see on the screen. Regardless of the fact that you can adjust the contrast it was still frustrating and requires you to strain your eyes to see the math problems. We love all of the functions but are going to return this product and have already purchased the Math Whiz. It doesn't do all of the functions that the Shark does but it's a good start and you can actually see the math problems on the screen very well!
4,I like MATH SHARK because it makes math fun!,Math Shark is fun to play because it helps you learn math. Math Shark is educational and is for kids of all ages
1,Piece of junk,"I bought the Mathshark for my 7-year-old child to practice her math skills. Opened the package, put in the batteries, and tried to use it. Half of the buttons did not work, no matter how hard I pressed. A few other buttons only worked if you pressed them REALLy hard. I was surprised given that we own several other Education Insights products with which we have had no problems. Too bad, a piece of junk."
2,LCD is too hard to read!,"It is a great concept -- but the LCD is just too hard to read, even when the contrast is set to high."
3,Lousy quality,"We received it as a gift, but it's going back as the number buttons don't work. You have to press really hard and maybe they would register.Will order another one as our son really enjoys it in school and has been asking for one for some time. Unit was assembled without quality control it seems. Hopefully the replacement will work."
3,Programming issue,When students are taught to do solve math problems they work right to left when writing down the answers. The problem with this item is that you have to enter the far left number first working back to the right. This makes the need to have piece of paper to write down the number before typing it in which slows down the use.
3,Fantastic,"Just got the math shark in the mail and my son is already inlove with it. I love the fact you can ajust the level for each subject weather it be subtraction, Division,since I have two kids. I will be able to let each one of them play it. Fast delivery! Great product. Thanks again :)"
2,Room to improve,"The screen is hard to see brand new. A year later and it is unreadable. My daughter learned with it and still tries to use it, but it's no use."
1,No customer service.,"My son used this for a little bit, nothing exceptional, but it worked as an electronic flashcard.One day he came home from school and teh battery cover was gone. Looked everywhere;couldn't locate. I contacted Educational Insights, completeley willing to pay for a new battery cover.They said bluntly, they could not help me. At all. The HAD no battery covers, they said. Thanks and goodbye.I would never purchase from any compnay that has such poor product service. Buy a math game for a PC or DS instead."
3,Good toy for practising math,I bought this for my 5-year old daughter. She really enjoyed using it and actually enjoyed the challenge of having to figure out the answers in the shortest time possible. The different levels of difficulty are useful so she can keep using it over the years.
1,Excellent concept - worthless product,"This is an excellent concept. It has every feature that you could think about. My kids liked this very much (5 and 7 year olds). However, the screen is worthless. It is faint and hurts the eye. There is no way you can turn up the brightness (no buttons for that). The numbers on the outside can't be seen at all. The window is the exact size as the screen so that light from any side casts shadow on the screen. Kids even when they are squinting to understand if the number is a one or seven make mistakes. I would have happlily given double this price to get a version with the screen resolution issue resolved. May be this would get resolved in the next version. Till then it is as worthless as a 74 inch plasma hdtv with a dead screen."
2,Math can be better,Not impressed. The graphics are very hard to read and all it is is numbers! In this world of amazing graphics this should not be an issue. My kids love math but this only holds my 7 year old attention for a few minutes. I would not recommend.
3,Does the trick,"This met the needs of 3 kids as they went through early grade school.Pluses: It does have a range of levels for each function. It's lasted three years.Minuses: LCD is hard to read - not enough contrast. Needs an optional back light. Buttons are 'squishy' and processor is slow - the kids can type faster than the machine can process.Overall, somewhat entertaining for the kids. They still felt it was a chore to go through the repetitive drills of their own volition, but not so bad that they wouldn't do it when asked. While it's not super-durable, it will last if cared for."
3,Too dark,"The Math Shark is an incredible tool! My son's skills and grades improved nearly immediately. I never have to fight with my little ""gamer"" to study his math facts anymore. The only problem we have found with it is the screen... it's very dark and difficult to see. You have to get the lighting around you just so or you can't see what's showing on the screen. Overall, it's great, but that's a real pain in the butt!"
4,good educational tool,"It works fine. It is good for all elementary grades. My only disappointment is the screen-not enough light and contrast of the digits, and the numbers displayed on the screen are kind of tiny and ""skinny"". I think it would be better if they were bigger and ticker. Anyway, it works great and is a useful tool."
3,EXCITING FOR THE KIDDIES,"I'M A COLLEGE STUDENT IN MY EARLY THIRTIES WHO IS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH PRE-ALGEBRA. I JUST RECEIVED MY MATH SHARK TODAY AND ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT REALLY GIVEN IT A CHANCE, SO FAR I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT IT IS NOT VERY CHALLENGING FOR ADULTS, BUT SHOULD BE A WONDERFUL PRACTICE TOOL FOR YOUNGER KIDS AND TEENAGERS. I DO RECOMMEND THE MATH SHARK TO KIDDIES WHO ARE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH BASIC MATH SKILLS."
3,Spring break,"I bought these shoes in red and they are adorable. The wedge heel is 3 inches and it took awhile for my feet to get use to, because I don't usually wear high heels. My heels are small and they slip out of the shoes, from time to time. I was hoping that because they are Aerosoles that they might be kinder to my feet and still give me that high heel chic look. I don't think my feet are made to wear high heels.Otherwise, I love the way these shoes look but I am not use to walking on the balls of my feet. They are great for people who are custom to wearing high heels. Unfortunately, they are not for me."
4,"Great Shoe, ran a little small",Product arrived in required time frame and in good condition. Size ran a little small.
2,Middle of the Road,"Huge Temptations Fan,but this Album is as by the numbers as Boyz11Men's Covers attempt,Barry Manilow's 50's cover Album&other Ones. while there are moments,it's not enough to pull off all the way through.cuts 8 on up kinda save face,but on a whole this Project ain't cracking."
2,Just Ordinary,"This CD is just plain ordinary, that's about all I can say. The remakes are not very good just tolerable. I expect more from the temps than just ordinary remake with no life."
5,Total Jams old skool,"It took me a long time to do this review.This is the Temptations, my number 1 group of all time. A lot of people have come and gone from this group but they still sound good. When I put this cd on in the car, my head get's to rock'in, finger's pop'in! This is the best cd since For Lover's Only. Can I get a witness,How sweet it is to be loved by you,Try it baby,Neither one of us,and Reach out and touch are the best of the best! Put this number 1 on your list."
3,I Expected More,"I love the Temptations. I love their history, their longevity but most of all I love the music. So what is the problem? Well, this is a great idea executed badly. I love the ""For Lover's Only"" album as it is an incredible individual interpretation of classic music. It was created with love and respect. This lacks all the ingedients of that album. It sounds like they had the idea one day, went into the studio next and came out feeling pleased with themselves. They added nothing new and have left this long time fan feeling short-changed. Why 3 stars, I love the Temps. For fans with a forgiving nature only. I hate to say it, but Michael McDonald did this first and second and better."
2,They Forgot What Makes the Tempts the Tempts,"The producers forgot what makes the Temptations the Temptations. The Temptations are more than just Otis Williams plus four guys who can sing. They drowned out the rich gospel harmonies that are a distinct Temptations trademark with background music that is way too loud on most of the songs. Featuring the group's singing is the key---not the background music! ""I Hear a Symphony,""""Ain't Nothin' Like the Real Thing,"" ""Try It Baby,"" ""Reach Out and Touch"" and ""What Becomes of the Brokenhearted"" have the harmony (for the most part) and to me are the best songs, but their harmonies have to be more confident. If they sing with that ""We are not just anyone...we are the Temptations"" attitude, they will be OK. If they don't learn from this effort, they will be only a shell of the great group that they can be...and they are capable of so much more. I am still in your corner, but do it right, guys...or don't do it at all!"
4,Still Temptin,"Great songs. Great singing. Are these the original 5 Temptations? No. There will never be a group like the orignal lineup of David, Eddie, Paul, Melvin and Otis. However, these gentlemen are keeping the tadition going. I am sure that they were not thinking that they were going to make a smash hit album. I believe that they wanted to do a Tempts interpretation of these classics. That is because there has not been nor is there anyone that sings there style of music like the Tempations. At first listen I did not hear anything special, but as I listened more, I began to notice my feet starting to pat, and my head starting to move along with the music. Then I notice that this is really some great singing. And finally, this is really a good CD. One thing is still true. These guys can sang. Still Tempting to me."
2,THE TEMPTATIONS,"This album represents what is wrong with The Temptations. They can sing, but these remakes are bland, by the numbers renditions. I can see Otis now, ""Hey guys, let's go into the studio and record Motown favorites...we can use them in our road show and everyone can sing along."" You can hear it in each song - there is no soul, just singing. Guys, this album is an insult to long-time Tempts fans."
1,Sic transit gloria,"While the name of the group remain ""The Temptations"", those comoponents that made it the greatest soul group in history are all long gone. Does anyone else find it ironic that while he was the founding member, Otis Williams, was never a lead singer?Without Ruffin, Kendrinks, P. Williams and Franklin to carry the tunes, and without Robinson, Whitfield, etc. to handle the arrangements, this CD is truly a waste.If you were there, you don't need this.If you were not there, go back and buy the originals."
3,Not there best.........,"Now me and all temptation fans around the world know that this is not the best wotk. To me it seems like the Temptations just made this album for money. When I popped this album into my stereo I only played less than half and took it out. The music was lousy, none of them had a nice sound. it was like buying karaoke album. Making an album resinging old songs was not the best way to go."
3,Not too tempting :-(,"Sorry, but this cd is a disappointment considering their career. It's sad when they have been on top of their game, and now are reduced to remaking songs that aren't even done too well. There are a few that stand out and make the album alright, but overall this doesn't cut it. I did like Don't Leave Me This Way (I've always loved this) and I Hear A Symphony and What Becomes Of The Brokenhearted. Their voices are still tight, but overall, the arrangements for many of these songs aren't fantastic at all. Next time, I hope they write NEW material. I do give them props though for the cool cd cover. I love that."
1,Can this really be the Temptations?,"I was born and raised in Motown and there's little I don't like about Motown music or it's stars. Therefore I excitedly purchased 2 of these CD's - one to give away. I had to apologize to the recipient. This is without a doubt one of the worse CD's I've heard. It's hard to believe that it's really the Temptations. The vocals are bad, they can't harmoize - even the music is bad. Is the entire group new and trying to pass themselves off as THE Temptations? The caliber of their previous CD, ""For Lovers only"" is what I was expecting and believe me, this one fell far short. By the way, the recipient of the other CD, another Temptation lover, had the same reaction. As much as I love them and for all the great music they've produced, if this really is The Tempations and this is the best they can do they should retire."
4,Slick bass sound,"My first set of Ernie Ball bass strings. So far, so good ! I really like the brightness of the sound I get with this Samick 5 string."
3,"Misprint in book, strange.","I was very thankful to find this book, however, when I started using it I realized that the first 30 pages were duplicated in the book. Very unusual, and annoying."
2,"instead of useful information, mostly random and useless","A small portion (around 10 out of 52) of these cards provided practical insight into the use of odds in poker--e.g., the odds you'll get the fifth card for your flush on the river. But the vast majority of cards were useless information I didn't need to know. I don't need to know the odds of flopping a straight flush with suited-connectors, or flopping quads with a pocket pair. While I would certainly like those things to happen, the odds of hitting hands that rare are really not worth bothering to calculate. These cards are not a comprehensive guide to poker odds, as I had expected, but rather are simply random bits of trivia with occasionally useful information."
2,Nice idea but doesn't work well enough,This was a good idea but poorly executed. Content not particularly helpful and presention quite poor
4,High Value - Low Cost,"Given the low price of this, it's hard to go wrong given the information.I play low limit on-line and if I'm too tired to multi-table, I look at the cards as a boredom reliever. After looking at them enough, the info becomes second nature.Obviously you can create your own cards with much deeper information, which I've done after using these for a while, but these are a no-brainer in terms of functionality.Who is it good for? Non-expert players who for some reason haven't learned their probability tables yet.Not good for: expert players and poker math geeks.I definitely recommend this for new players."
5,Handy pocket tool for the Hold 'Em player,"This very unique item has been very useful to my game. It focus is entirely on the mathematics of Hold 'Em. I helps you to practice calculating (or memorize) the odds of catching and making particular hands, as well as factoring in pot odds.What makes this product truly special is its method of delivery. The playing card sized deck of flash cards can be taken anywhere. I regularly take mine to the park with the kids, the mall with the wife, and even to games I am playing in just in case I need to brush up.This was well worth the seven bucks -- Highly recommended."
5,Don't Miss Out!,"I highly recommend this product, they are fun to play with and even fun to learn from. Poker Flash Cards have made a tremendous impact on my overall game. I can see a marked improvement in my decision-making ability and my betting strategies."
4,flash card review,these are really good if you sant to learn the odds of hitting a certain hand that you are drawing to
5,The sound of sprinkled diamonds,"Perhaps a little poetic of a description, but that's my simple, non-expert opinion. I've heard various versions of Ravel's piano works over the years, but never like this: brilliant, crystalline, and crisply articulated; each turn of phrase throws light in all directions. Will lift you out of your chair. Simply dazzling."
5,Angela Hewitt: Ravel,Ms. Hewitt has a way with Ravel. I could tell that she knew a great deal about this music before laying down these tracks. MOST enjoyable album I have purchased all year!
4,A fine Ed McBain story-good filmed.,I did love the Ed McBain story.Movie is OK.If you place yourself in a japanese environnement.I preferred the TV.movie with Robert Lansing and Norman Fell.
3,Kurosawa Chase Thriller,"""High and Low"" is one of Kurosawa's more popular films. The film concerns a criminal kidnapping the son of a wealthy shoe mogul who gets enough money to buy out his company. The kidnapping comes at the worst time -- because the kidnapper wants the exact amount of money the mogul has, and to make things worse the kidnapper kidnapped the son of the mogul's chauffeur. This happens in the first half hour, and the rest of the film is spent chasing after the criminal, leading to one of the best endings to a Kurosawa film, wherein the Mogul and Kidnapper finally meet face to face. The film is too long, with the cops hitting dead end after dead end. If it was shorter and tighter it would have been better. But, it's not a bad Friday night rental. If you like Kurosawa's line of work, you will appreciate this film."
2,A rather boring social commentary,"Just watched this off Netflix streaming and must say I was disappointed. The acting is amateurish and the story moves slowly. The most unsatisfactory part is the aide, who seems rude in the beginning and whose cold-heartedness is way too predictable. But pretty much everybody else is unbelievable, either, and once you see who the kidnapper is (about halfway through) the rest becomes even more boring.If you like boring movies, this is for you."
5,Riveting Tour De Force,"This movie is Japanese, so, ok, there are a few odd or annoying parts, and it takes a while to get rolling, but this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Mifune is at his best. The actors who play the cops are great, and so is the evil the evil bad guy (fantastic). A scene near the end where Akira Kurasowa has the evil bad guy's sunglasses catch the light in an alley at night is scary as hell. It reminded me of Sin City where Elijah Wood's glasses demonify him. The device of moving the plot along by means of the police ""meetings"" is brilliant structure-wise, and reminds me of Harry Bosch with his omnipresent Murder Book, same thing. I watched this from start to end without moving or taking a break. This movie was way ahead of it's time and would be a fantastic Remake. I recommend this film without hesitation. Watch it!"
4,Detective Story And Moral Dilemma,"This is my first Kurosawa film that's not a Samurai story. Once again, I am impressed by Kurosawa's story telling talent. In this film we have the businessman character who loses everything if he pays a ransom, but let's a little boy die if he does not. The story takes so many twists and turns that it keeps your interest.The cinematography is gorgeous black and white. It's very interesting to see Japan and its locations. The Criterion print is very good. And Kurosawa's widescreen compositions are excellent as well.I continue to discover Mr. Kurosawa's work and am loving every film so far!"
1,my cat wont eat it.,"i guess it is a matter of your cat's personal preference. My cat, however, will not eat this for some reason. Strange. She used to eat royal canin from her previous owner. I have been feeding her 9 lives dry cat food which she eats pretty well. I've given her a trial of the purina one smartblends and she'll prefer that over 9 lives (but still eats both). So tried this goodlife salmon version since it is one of the grocery store brands that has 2nd highest protein content and is all natural. well, she'd rather starve than eat this....she'll eat the stale 9 lives over this. :( i sniffed this brand and it smells quite different from 9 lives and purina one....it reminds me of the cat food i used to feed my first cat back in 1989. Weird, i know but it really does remind me of such. Again, maybe this is just my cat, but just a heads up on this. this isnt a purina brand but is manufactured by Mars corporation (yea, same company that makes Mars chocolate bars)."
4,Great,"the entire cd is a great maxi single, a definite better alternative to the UK singles. my only problem with this single is that it replaces the track 'ARP' from the UK single with 'Sunday', originally from the 'Run On Extended' single, which is quite disappointing, considering 'ARP' is an epic track, especially the second half, which is basically a tweaked version of 'Every One Of My Problems' from the 'That's When I Reach For My Revolver' single."
4,moby does happy filtered house with scratchin? YES!,"ok ok ok heres the deal this a really cool cut. I know its playin on the radio but these remixes are great esp. the main remis on the a side I dont have it right in front of me as I at werk, but basically it s like this. There is a pretty good little french house happy house beat wigth some filtering loops and then there is a break down and the song turns into breaks with scrating, then it goes back into the house loops its definetly worth the 5 or 6 bucks for this domestic vinyl. the bside has 2 really good mixes as well. ok now I must go but, Ill seeya all out on the dance floor, djdude"
5,A PHAT HOUSE PARTY,"I was in club VELVET*St. Louis, MO, enjoying the mixes by Danny MO, then all of sudden, BAMM! The party was on. Just when I thought I had is going on I slipped into another groove, all in one record. Phat tracks like this don't happen every day, ""BODYROCK"", if you ain't got it, you need to get it, TODAY! You won't be disappointed."
1,Incomplete and disappinting story.,"Iwould not waste money on buying this book. Borrow it from the library if you think you have to read it.The editing is poor to the point of distraction. The characters never really firm up and at the end there are many loose ends that go unsolved. Even the last recipe seems to have a missing ingredient.The story line probably was a good idea; I kept waiting for something to happen, but it just never did.Ann Amantea"
2,Just ok....,"I read this book in about 2 hours. I found the characters annoying and one dimensional, and the plot was boring. I think the best character died in the first chapter. This series needs some work, and the recipes sound NASTY."
3,Still as Uneven as the First in the Series,"I was hoping this book would be better than the first. Instead, nothing's changed. Although I have to applaud anyone with the energy and spunk to get a novel published, I wish Ms. Crawford would learn English grammar and punctuation. Really, would it hurt to add a comma here and there? And the grammar really needs attention; sometimes, it's impossible to tell from the narrative which character is doing or saying what. I still find the characters too broadly drawn, although Marvin is starting to catch my interest. Given time and a willingness to improve, I think this could be a very enjoyable series."
1,does not swivel,"it's a double female connector; true. The problem is it says it's a swivel connector, but once you tighten the hose it locks up completely. great female to female connector. Poor swivel."
1,not for use with water,"This connector sprayed water from the center immediately, so it is not useful for joining hoses. It might have some value as a tiny paper weight."
4,"OK, but hard to completely stop leaks","I bought this to fit onto my AR Blue Clean AR383 Electric Pressure Washer, another item sold through Amazon. Before using this unit, the water under pressure would leak badly. With this unit, the leak is now down to a constant slow drip. Not perfect, but tolerable. I would buy this item again."
3,"Useful, but Flawed","I bought this book because its text kept coming up on searches from homework assignments, and the nomenclature was consistent with what my professor was using in class, while his recommended textbook was not. Apparently, he had used this book before, and in that regard it proved invaluable, but I could see why he switched to another text. Every chapter has bits of many topics, but you don't get the whole thing in any one. That might have some logic if you were just reading cover to cover, but when trying to look up any topic, it means sorting through 20 or more entries with only a little bit of information in each place. At least it gave me a way to look up the variable names used in that that professor's lectures, but beyond that, this wasn't a useful reference."
4,Nice software with book,The PowerWorld students software is pretty neat. Good user interface and handles large enough portions of a grid to get good feel for system behaviour - active and reactive power. Fun overloading grid and causing blackouts. Book material OK and links in to software well.
3,Basic book for starting with power engineering,"This book was usefull for my introduction course to electric prower engineering, for this porpuse is the best book you can find. But Don't expect it to be very profound."
4,A great recording if you want both concertos,This CD was introduced to me by a friend of mine and I fell in love with it immediately. The soloists are both excellent and the orchestras are very well conducted and play with great vigor. The Violin Concerto is a live recording and is engineered very well. The Piano Concerto is a studio recording and it is also very engineered well. Not a bad choice at a budget prince.
2,NOT THAT GREAT,"this anime was not that fun to watch,it was not well made.Also the speaking of death made me not like it.So i give it 2 stars."
4,Head Office,This movie is very funny and highly underated. It surprises me that it's never shown on tv.
3,I got Abba. You like Abba?,"This movie is truly funny at times. I haven't seen it in a while, but I remember my impression of it being a little bit mixed. A very uneven film, but perhaps this trait befits the coke-addled eighties.It may also be the case, as some reviewers have suggested, that the movie could withstand and even benefit from repeated viewings. Damn funny movie at times, though."
3,Office Mania,I saw this movie years ago and remembered that Rick Moranis' role was particularly funny. I watched the movie again mainly to see him. I wasn't disappointed.
2,Miss Sunshine,Cut off several frustrating times and picture quality was bad several times. It cut me off and I had to reconnect with the movie.
2,Dissapointed,I have to say I was truly dissapointed by this movie. I had heard how great it was. If you like sad stories you will like this too. The movie had some good points but all in all I can't recommend it. The actors did a great job but the story was lacking.
2,What's to Like?,"I guess I just don't understand why people seem to so enjoy portrayals of hideous dysfunction in families. I found this movie to be so awful that I couldn't even make it through the dinner scene to finish the rest of what I think was probably more of the same: scenes of a family that is ridiculously screwed up. Why do people like this kind of cr*p? Isn't there enough garbage to see out there in our day-to-day world? So sue me, I didn't watch the whole thing, but I couldn't stomach anymore of the nastiness."
2,"Well directed/written movie, but just plain boring...","The movie was directed and written and acted beautifully, but it was just plain boring. It's not worth buying, in my eyes. It's a rental, and you can think you got your money's worth because the rental has the 4 different endings too. Four endings???? What?"
2,Mostly sleazy with a few good moments,"There are a few good laughs but mostly it is exploitive and sleazy. This is especially so of the grandfather who is advising his teenage grandchildren to have all the sex they can.As is typical of much of Hollywood, it is well produced and acted, but he content is quick and shallow."
2,What's the Hype About?,"Wow - I was sooo disappointed by this movie. People that normally have the same taste as me highly recommended this movie. I kept waiting for the good parts. As mentioned in a few other reviews, there were a couple laughs, but not enough to purchase the movie. I honestly can't imagine this being good for a little kid to watch either (way too much adult language and sexual commentary by grandpa and not enough little kid interest).The whole premise was also a little contrived, as it was supposed to be a big surprise that these 6 year olds were creepy looking in their makeup etc. However, with all of the Jon-Benet publicity a few years back, I think everyone in the US knows that these little girl pageants are just wrong. The unbelievability of it all just added to the slow story.Get Ice Age 2 instead."
2,Sunshine on my mind,"Another Xmas gift to one of my kids. I have not seen it, nor know anything about it. so, can not give it a thumbs up or down....you will need to do your own research on this one. It is in the comedy category."
2,Shocking Movie??,"This is one reason why my wife and I don't go to the movies. There just aren't any good movies produced. But what shocked us the most was the use of the four-letter ""F"" work through out the movie. Perhaps we are prudes, but what kind of a movie would subject a young girl to such language. And the star didn't have much of a role, except perhaps the dance routine at the end of the show.Don't waste your money!"
2,The bad outweighs the good,"Everyone else I have talked to who has seen this movie thought it was hilarious and loved it. I thought it well done but very distasteful.Self-absorbed neglectful parents; sad, angry, ignored son desperate to escape his dysfunctional family; invisible daughter who is left by her oblivious parents to spend way too much time with her foul-mouthed, heroin-snorting, porn-loving grandfather; middle-aged gay uncle mourning the loss of his opportunistic boy-toy by trying to commit suicide; this movie has all the ingredients of a great comedy!Yes, there are a few funny bits, but I left this movie thinking it a scathing inditement of the child porn - sorry I mean child pagent - industry and the parents who prostitute their young daughters into it."
2,Miss no Sunshine,Maybe good for younger audiences but not worth the watch for anyone else Or for me anyway.
1,What Am I Missing?,How could standards have dropped to the point where this is considered a good movie? Enough said!
2,Huh?,"Maybe they forgot to put the laugh-track on my DVD, because I could not for the life of me figure out when to be amused. I started the movie, sat on my couch, and waited to laugh. Unfortunately humor was missing from this and the only thing it made me feel was awkward. The actors seemed as if they were reading lines in an early rehearsal. Did no one else feel this? I mean, I like Steve Carrell and Alan Arkin as much as the next guy, but they couldn't hope to elevate the contrived, derivative script. The whole plot and every character in it felt incredibly forced, more than in any movie I can think of. I didn't buy a second of it. This movie sounded like it would be right up my alley. My close friends and family told me the same thing. Boy was I disappointed."
5,On the sunny side of the street,"A country, that produces movies, which are as scathingly sarcastic about its own culture, cannot be entirely lost to civilization. America does understand America after all. I have hope.This movie is as black a piece of humour as you can find. Possibly not even the title hero is quite right in her mind, but let us be generous. She is cute. The most so when she loses her mind over having qualified for the finals.The rest of the family has been accurately summarized as ""dysfunctional"". What a nice word. Whoever found it and popularized it deserves a special praise. It is even better, all by itself, than Greg Kinnear's wonderful lecture on refusing to lose. Only in America...It is so realistic, you could shed tears over it. It is so funny, you can hardly ever laugh, seriously."
2,BOOOOOORRRIIINNNNGGG!!!,"This movie is boring. The 3 funny parts in it, are not worth sitting the whole hour and 1/2 for. This movie could have been so much better."
3,"O.k., let me explain","The story behind the movie is good, disfunctional family trying to pull together to make a little girls dream come true. How we get the story told to us is another thing. The grandpa character is way over the top, I thought they could have made him crazy and loud without all the F bombs, and references to sex. I liked the movie but was glad I didn't pay to see it. I would like the movie industry to take storylines like this and make it a family movie, one you wouldn't be embarrased to take your mom too."
4,fun,"Now this film is a bit on the odd ball side, it is funny, and I like it, I don't think it was Oscar worthy, but then I didn't think the Movie ""Babe"" ( the pig one ) was best Movie and it won, ""Apollo 13"" was much better for that yrs Oscar, but Hollywod didn't want Tom Hanks to have 3 in a row..politics...lol Anyway as I was saying it's a cute film but NOT for kids.....The ""F"" word is used a lot."
1,Don't waste your time,"A pathetic excuse for entertainment. I was embarrassed for all of them as actors (the little girl was cute though, and it was not her fault that her parents let her work in a movie like that). There was a lot of profanity for a family theme. I thought it was going to be a good movie, but I was terribly wrong."
4,Dysfunctionality can be funny...,"This was a tragic comedy because this family almost has no hope of recovery, but laughing at them can make you think your life really isn't that bad."
1,So awful I had to watch the ceiling!,"Okay, I've heard and read the reviews. What's up with that? The only way I could imagine that someone considers this stuff funny is if their own family is that cruel and mean to each other on a constant basis. I've worked very hard to create a safe and kind environment in my home. Why do I want to be placed in the middle of this ugly family and experience the hatred, anger, cussing, disrespect, and sexuality that this innocent little girl has to bear? Is this how bad the typical American family has gotten that most people rate this movie as fun to watch? I felt like a piece of my soul was taken after experiencing this film. If that means I'm too innocent - I would have rather have kept that innocence, and not traded it for the yuck feeling I had watching this unhappy family."
3,"Wow, epic, not","Is this a remake of the Griswalds vacation to Wally World? Hello, it's the same thing, family takes road trip; there is mom and dad, grandfather, son, and daughter in a dysfunctional family. The grandfather dies on the way. Notice any similarities yet? Vehicle breaks down...etc.......could go on.with that aside, it's not a bad movie, it's just that it's not that great. Characters were annoying and unbelievable. A goth son wanting to fly jets? wierd, whatever. I don't see this movie breaking any new ground in what it is presenting."
1,ELITIST DOGMA OVERATED DO NOT BUY,"THIS FILM MADE ME HAPPY TO NOT BE LOCKED INTO A BLAND SYSTEMIC PATHOGENIC HETERO LIFESTYLE, OF LOWER MIDDLE CLASS. IF THIS PASSES FOR ART IT IS REALLY FULL OF PROCESSED FOOD!"
2,Alan Arkin is Way Over the Top,"If you can endure the foul language and constant talking about sex at the beginning, the movie is good. At the end of the movie I was rolling on the floor with laughter. Why Arkin got an Oscar for this I don't know. I've dealt with people in situations like he was supposedly representing, and they control themselves much better than him. I call it bad/poor acting. The part could have been played better by most anyone. This could have been a really great movie if handled properly."
1,Little Miss Sunshine,"Have no idea who this file was made for, too much dirty language for kids,and absolutely no story line, or even good acting for Adults. Each character appeared to be playing in his or her own private film. Never came together at all."
1,Help me! I'm dying!!!,"I looked through my pile of unwatched DVDs looking for something bright, original and warm. You have got to be kidding! Little Miss Sunshine is vile, hateful and is populated with NOTHING but cardboard stereotypes. I was hoping for characters that were quirky but ultimately loveable. The screenwriter and director think that pornography, the F-word uttered in front of a 7 yr old and yelling arguments are ""hillarious"" as some reviewers have deemed this film. I was looking for something bright and truely insightful and funny with the viewing of this film. Instead it made me physically ill not so much because it was such an ugly hateful film but because so many people have bought into the hype of whatever other people tell you is good is therefore good. Very, very disturbing..."
1,Pretty Lame,"While I was watching this movie, my only question was ""When will this thing be over?"" I found it lame, boring and very reminiscent of another movie which I found equally boring and lame: American Beauty. I will never understand why Hollywood is so fascinated with movies about dysfunctional families. If you liked American Beauty, you'll love Little Miss Sunshine. However, if you detested American Beauty, as I did, you will detest this movie as well. The characters were dull and uninteresting, as was the plot (if you can call it that). I have no idea why Alan Arkin was nominated (let alone won) for this mess. It must have been a sentimental vote. His part as the grandpa was small and of no consequence. Steve Carell, with his hang-dog face and manner, annoyed me the most playing the suicidal brother-in-law. As far as I'm concerned, this movie was a waste of money to make and to go and see."
2,WTF?!? VERY OVERATED MOVIE.,The biggest regret I have is that I will never get the time I spent watching this movie back. I'm not going to ruin anything about the movie but I will say that it is way over-rated and that you're better off watching something else!
1,Dull beyond belief.,"What a sad, dreary movie this was. I'm dumbfounded by all the people claiming this is the funniest movie they've ever seen. Even the actors looked bored making it. I'm pretty sure Steve Carell was sleep walking through most of this big snooze fest."
3,"Oddly funny, and funnily odd","Little Miss Sunshine is a story of a family that makes a cross country trip for a pagent for their young daughter. Along the way, they encounter personal tragedy, and the loss of a family member. You won't find to many movies like this, it's odd, and awkwardly times humor make it funny, yet uncomfortable. It's not the warm, happy ending, family fold back together type of movie, but you do get some feel-good sense out of it. There are a few moments that make you laugh, but otherwise for me it's not a comedy. It's awkward, and unreal. Again, I am not the biggest Toni Collette fan either, but I think she is less awkward here than in anything else I've ever seen her in. Interesting, and strange- but not for everyone, and not my favorite."
3,A mixed bag,"Olive is a little girl who dreams of winning a beauty pageant. Her family consists of a nerotic father, a gay uncle, a foul-mouthed grandfather, and a brother who has taken a vow of silence. They pile into a VW van which has as many quirks as the family, and head off for California so that Olive can live out her dream. There are over-the-top moments, some of which are funny and some of which are merely tasteless. The most heartwarming moment in the film occurs when the family has a rare show of solidarity when they serve as back-up dancers for Olive, who is doing a dance number which was unfortunately choreographed by her grandfather. Olive is a refreshing contrast to the Jon Benet Ramsey look-alikes she is competing against, but this movie was still a bit over-the-top for me."
4,SUNSHINE,"This was a cute film, that really flys because of some wonderful performances. The story is essentially about a plucky little girl, whose belief in herself and inner spirit makes members of her family realize things about life and what's ultimately important. The acting is top notch in this, with Arkin winning an Academy Award for his great preformance, but it's the little girl that steals the show with her eyes that convey so much in their innocent gaze."
3,And you thought your family was dysfunctional,"I like this movie- I would probably watch it again. I won't give a boring, long review, that is so overstated so here it goes.Adult content and language. It makes you sad,laugh, leaves you shocked, and you can follow the movie.It is not the normal family movie, where every one gets along and only one problem throws a normal family out of whack. Like similar family vacation movies. This one is way different.This is a normal dysfunctional family life. Well, let's not hope so.Overall, I would watch it again. Good movie. Good actors. Very independant film channel looking, but the actors look familar."
2,Disfunction at its most mediocre,"Wow, was this ever a lame movie! It's unbelievable to me that so many people liked it! How is it possible that so many people had a VW bus AND are willing to love a movie on the basis of the vehicle alone? In all honesty, the funniest part of the movie was when they got to CA and the door fell off of the van (and that only got maybe half of a smile).Perhaps my family wasn't quite disfunctional enough for me to find this terribly amusing, because BOY, it sure wasn't!"
3,Not what I was expecting,"I had heard raves of this movie for years and was finally talked into watching it while friends were over. It took a good half an hour to get the story rolling. The beginning is droll and a bit depressing. The characters are quirky and unique, but entirely dsyfunctional. The movie picks up the pace when the family jumps (literally) into their old, beat-up VW van. It had funny moments, but wasn't the stitch-in-the-side comedy I was looking forward to."
4,Good and funny,"Little Miss Sunshine is really fin to watch. Is it ""Best Picture Worthy- not so sure about that"". But I did enjoy it, kind of compared its feel to Bottle Rocket which I loved."
1,constantly freezes,I purchased this video for a class assignment. The video constantly freezes and I have missed crucial points in the movie due to the freezing. I did not have the time to return the video and purchase another copy. I made sure it was a new video and not a used copy to avoid this type of issue. I will not buy any future videos from Amazon.
4,It got the nomination? The big nomination?,"Well it is a sweet film that has recieved way more than its share of publicity. I loved it for the van they drove around in, like one my family had growing up. There was an uncomfortable mix of dark and light characters that eventually blossoms in the end with a fantastic dance showing that love had gelled them together past all adversity and the world at large. Big film it is not but still a bit of sunshine."
3,"Touching, in a weird way","I was expecting this movie to be hysterical (basing that on the review from a friend). It was more sad yet touching yet slightly disturbing...I don't know, it wasn't what I was expecting and therefore I found it lacking."
1,Don't Believe The Hype on this Depressing Film,"This is one of the few movies I have felt like walking out of. My girlfriend, who wanted to see this film, agreed it was depressing. The only entertaining part was the brilliant Alan Arkin, who was unfortunately in only part of this film.There was no cohesiveness, just a dysfunctional family misadventure.Guys, don't let your partner talk you into seeing this film."
2,Quiet on the Set!,"I hate it when you are trying to watch a movie and people keep yaking! Take your gift of gab and hit the road, no diarhea of the mouth please Chatty Cathy, its the highway or my way! Say it don't spray it and please don't let the door hit you on the way out! I didn't hear half of this movie, and while Steve was probably funny and that adorable little girl had to have some good one liners, I ultimately did not get a chance to sit through this because of all the talking in my house. If you are going to watch a movie...WATCH IT DON'T BOTCH IT!"
1,Another car trip to Walley World,"I can't believe I sat thru the whole movie waiting for something to happen. If you saw National Lampoon's Vacation with Chevy Chase taking his family in a car to the WalleyWorld theme park, then you've seen this movie, except Vacation was better."
1,No more pagents,I thought this movie sounded so cute. After watching it I was so disappointed.It was one of the worst movies I had seen in a long time.Buyer beware...
1,NO stars,This movie is about a family so dysfunctional with situations that are sad and tragic rather than funny - I couldn't get past the first 25 minutes of it and regretted spending $2.50 in rental fees.
4,Over rated,It was a good movie but certainly nothing Oscar worthy. The little girl didn't do anything that Dakota Fanning hasn't done better. The movie had some laughs but other than that it was kind of depressing.
1,"boring, not funny",I found this film to be quite boring. It was not funny and I'm not sure why people think it was so great. To sum it up in one word: lame.
1,"This was bad, boring, and a waste of time.","This movie was a huge waste of time. The story was pointless; it was simply of little value. What good thing could be said of this movie? Nada. I was hoping for something more from this fabulously overhyped piece of junk. It's a bad movie because these people simply have no redeeming features about them. As a result, the movie seems overly contrived and without direction. Avoid this one like the plague; you'll be better off saving a few books."
1,Little Miss Dysfunction,"Why this movie got an Oscar nomination for Best Picture is beyond me. On the positive side a number of reviewers have picked up on what I have been saying all along, Little Miss Sunshine is little more than a reworking of National Lampoon's Vacation. On the negative side, many people who claim to never patronize ""mainstream"" movies (like Vacation), love Little Miss Sunshine, after all it's an ""art house flick"", one must like it.The end result being a VERY dark comedy, with little social redemption.PS If you want to see a great ""indie/art house"" movie about a family at a crossroads, check out, Brooklyn Lobster, a great movie that did not become ""the movie one must see to be in"" (see my review).Ken"
1,don't expect much,"Not recommended ... at all... under the genre of comedy so i expected at least a couple of laughs (i understand you have to watch this with a certain point of view, but i think i might have smirked once or twice (sort of laughed when the horn wouldn't stop blowing). When it was over i was glad, simply put."
3,Overtly Stereotypical on Models.,"It was an alright movie; however, that ending was not what I expected it to be for a movie entitled ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" because there was no ""Sunshine"" in the end."
4,Soundtrack,"Awesome soundtrack, would listen to it all day if I could. Movie was good too-- a lot of family tension."
3,entertaining,I did enjoy this movie. It was one of those movies where I just didn't know what was going to happen next. It was not predictable like some. It had an interesting kind of humor to it.
5,Beepin Banana Bus,"This film was hysterical. While I think most everyone relates to Olive at some point, the fully represented dynamic of the nutty family is probably equally familiar. I loved everything about this film, except that it ended."
4,Sunshine is a hoot and a holler,"Little Miss is irreverent, silly, sweet, hysterically funny, touching, goofy and one of the best feel-good movies of 2006. An unlikely contestant in an unlikely contest with an unlikely entourage of relatives who are either emotional messes (brother and uncle), emotionally immature (dad and grandpa) or steadfastly put-upon (mom and little miss sunshine) embark on a journey which will leave all of them touched in some way forever.If you think your family is quirky, they have nothing on Little Miss Sunshine's family.Pop some popcorn, grab a drink, and sit down and enjoy the ride. And try not to fall out of your chair laughing.A special call-out for the best use so far of a Rick James hit."
3,"Good, But A Bit Over-Rated","I love movies without big budgets and without big stars. I went to see this because of the reviews, and was a bit dissapointed. The characters were excellent and it was pretty funny at times, but over all, I didn't really feel much when it was over. I probably won't see it ever again, and really wouldn't recomend it to anyone. At the same time I didn't feel robbed of my money when I saw it in the movies. So if you want to see it, my advise would be to rent before buying, because while it was an ok movie, I'm not sure most would watch it more than once."
5,Grapes of Sunshine,"All right, this is probably a lame comparison between Little Miss Sunshine and John Ford's Grapes of Wrath but I see it. Both films are about family and what pulls them apart and what holds them together. Greg Kinnear is in his own way Pa Joad trying to provide for his family dealing with economic forces he doesn't understand. Toni Collette is Ma Joad: keeping the family together is everything. Alan Arkin is Grandpa Joad, too old to kid himself and too old to be taken away from his home. Paul Dano is Winfield and a redemptive Connie Rivers. Steve Carell is Casy, a lost tag-a-long who finds his soul. And Abigal Breslin is Rose-of-Sharon who certainly is able to bring life and hope to a family in need of both. And that ""beauty pageant,"" well if not the dust bowl is as devastating of youth and hope as the real thing.What a great film that can take you apart and bring make you better and so much more appreciative of being a member of a ""real"" family."
3,"Great movie, poor product","This is a great movie, but the 24-hour playback restriction for Unbox-to-Tivo videos is severe. Especially for families with young kids, it helps if the movie can be watched over the course of two evenings. Why not just let us keep the movie for the full 30 days? The DRM scheme still protects it."
2,"Superb acting, average movie","I thought the acting and the characterization were wonderful. The movie overall was not wonderful, a C+ at best. It had a few funny moments. But it tried too hard to be a Seinfeld episode meets Whalerider meets Terms of Endearment.Also recommended: IN HER SHOES, WHALERIDER, NURSE BETTY, DEAR GOD, or AS GOOD AS IT GETS."
5,Little Miss Sunshine,This will become a classic. It captures the struggle and dysfunction of the American family. Very funny.
4,Great show!,"Hilarious, from start to finish. You listen and stare at each other in amazement that they collectively grasped the concept of the whole family on a road trip persona. It was a great show and I loved the moral of the whole thing that family comes first, no matter what!"
4,Hello there,"Very good movie. I personally think that Blood Diamond or Pan's Labrynth deserved its spot as Best Picture Nominee, but still very good."
3,9 hellish steps to redemption,"This is a funny and touching movie with a sharply observed script and fine performances from all the cast. Although deceptively slight on plot there is plenty to enjoy during the insanely hapless road trip and the excruciating beauty pageant. And the journey is, of course, a cathartic one for all concerned. My only criticisms are that the quirkiness of the characters is a little clichéd and the ending a little too self-consciously feel-good. But these small faults detract little from its overall success."
3,Three and a half stars,"Well worth seeing, if only for two things: Steve Carell's performance, and one scene between between the two young siblings while they're on the road which reveals why this little girl is the life force of this eccentric family."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Little Miss Sunshine suprised me as much as anyone by charming its way to an undeserved Best Picture nomination, but it's still a funny and fast-moving road comedy with its share of affecting moments and quotable lines."
4,So funny my husband cried!,"Every family has a few crazies, so nearly everyone can RELATE to this movie. You might have to overlook some of Grandpa's improprieties, but once you do, you will be laughing at how some of these adventures could happen to any family - including yours."
5,So funny!,"If you haven't seen Little Miss Sunshine yet, you absolutely must see this movie. It's a dark comedy starring Toni Collette and Greg Kinnear. Abigail Breslin stars as Olive, a little girl traveling with her family to compete in the regional Little Miss Sunshine pageant. I would recommend this movie to everyone, but especially mothers with daughters who compete in pageants. Olive shows us that inner beauty is the most important quality a person can have. Also, anyone in the Air Force will appreciate this movie as well."
4,Little Miss Sunshine Illuminating Family Disfunction,"Coming from a disfunctional family, only mine was not this outrageous, I feel like a well qualified expert to review this DVD.Whoever picked the characters and the actors to portray this family should have received an Academy Award. Steve Carell as the jilted suicidal homosexual was over the top. Alan Arkin as a horn dog, heroin snorting, renegade grandfather who taught Olive, his granddaughter, her dance routine for the Little Miss Sunshine competition was hysterical.I don't want to give away the ending, but think ""Rick James"" and you can piece it together. It is kind of like Joan Benet Ramsey meets National Lampoon's Vacation with the Griswolds. Definitely worth watching."
1,"Sorry everybody, but this one's a complete loser","A better title would have been Little Miss Useless Flogging of the Fbomb. Boring, offensive, and unoriginal. I could hardly make it all the way through. To award Alan Arkin an oscar for his performance is an insult to any moviegoer's intelligence. Although I recognized and appreciated the ""type"" each character was intended to portray, none were compelling enough to keep my attention. I was too embarrassed to have this DVD in my collection, so I scratched it up with a knife and chucked it in the trash."
3,Not Hilarious!,"I like Steve Carell, that being the reason I was interested in seeing this movie. He was a very serious character in this movie. The acting was good. The story was slow. My favorite part of the movie was the ending where it finally got a little funny. In the trailer for this movie they make it look funny, but don't be fooled."
4,Little Miss Sunshine,On the surface a classic Road Trip of a disfunctional family but on reflection the story of a bonding journey that cements the family around the dream of a little girl. A great cast that works well together... I understand they spent a week riding around LA in their '70s Volkswagan Bus before beginning to shoot the movie just to get to know each other...
2,Yawn. Utterly pointless,"I dont get the hype about this film. We basically went to see if because of all the build up. I disliked it off the bat. It was kind of boring and completely disbelieving. No way in hell would anyone in their right mind do anything that happened in this film. I hate these 'dysfuntional family' type movies which never make sense and again, are not realistic in the least. I am shocked the Academy even nominated this for anything."
2,I guess I don't get it.,"I give it 2 stars for originality and good performances. But this is really a film about nothing. (That was a good thing in Seinfeld) While I won't give away the ending, not that there's really anything to give away, I will just say that every clear thinking person should be a little disturbed and probably have Jonbenet Ramsey flashbacks. As for the hype surrounding this film, I don't get it."
1,Dumb,"What a dissapointment this movie was. Dysfunctional could have been interesting, but wasn't. It could have been funny, but wasn't. Glad I watched this for free."
1,Absolutely Terrible,"From all the positive reviews, I thought this would be at the very least decent. This is just a terrible film. If you think you are going to get a Chevy Chase-type ""Vacation"" film, forget it. The story line has a lot of potential - problem is, NONE of it is ever developed. The profanity in the film seems to be there just for profanity's sake - not to add anything. Don't waste your money on this one. Hollywood is in a sad state of affairs if this is what gets nominated for an Oscar, but then again Oscars have nothing to do with how good a film is."
1,No redeeming value,"I might've found the family-bonding & little girl to be cute & adorable, but was disgusted with this filthy piece of garbage after Alan Arkin began cursing disgusting obscenities in front of his grandson & granddaughter in this film. Unfortunately Hollywood doesn't care about morality & class. They will exploit children to cash in on something. I guess if they think it can sell, go ahead & market it.Admittedly, I am a fan of many R-Rated films, but I believe a line should be drawn & not crossed when the dialogue is raunchy in the presence of a child. Little Miss Sunshine is also R-Rated & NOT a family movie by any means. Give it a miss. One reviewer gave a great recommendation... see National Lampoon's Vacation (or Little Miss Marker (1980)) instead. (Either are really a far better choice.)"
1,This was supposed to be funny?,"Okay, lessee here... we have a suicidal uncle, a junky grandfather with a nasty mouth, a teenage brother who hates everybody so much that he hasn't uttered a word in 9 months, and a father whose dreams keep going up in smoke. Oh yeah, that's a real hoot. NOT! I found the first 95 minutes or so of this movie depressing, not funny. Not even mildly amusing. The dance scene near the end was kind of funny, and it was nice that some of the family found some common bond and became a little less dysfunctional at the end. But it wasn't worth sitting through the first hour and a half to get there. I've never rated a movie worse than ""okay"" before, but this was possibly the worst I've ever seen. On the plus side, Abigail Breslin is very talented. She was wasted in this bomb."
5,A sunny film with a great message,"Little Miss Sunshine is wonderfully upbeat family movie that exudes warmth and promotes family values in a way that is smart, funny and serious all at the same time. I highly recommend this film. Those who dismiss this excellent film are missing the message of family, loyalty, and the ability to stop taking ourselves so darn seriously while we miss out on life's pleasures, lessons and trials. Just like the uncle told his nephew, even the hard lessons are something to look forward to rather than fear. I think some people are really missing out here if they shy away from the fun and hope this movie brings to American audiences."
3,"Great movie, Awful DVD.","Although the movie is definately one of my favorites of all time, this DVD is awful. The picture quality is not good, and the extras are severely lacking. Wait for the inevitable double-dip, and if you have a BD player, wait for it there."
4,LOL!!,I just rented this movie the other day and I thought it was hilarious. At first when I heard about the movie I thought it would have been cheesy. To my surprise the movie was hilarious. After thinking about it I realzed that the movie couldn't be that bad b/c Steve Carell from 40yr old Virgin was in it. The funniest part of the movie was the end!!! That little girl is hilarious. Please go see the movie. Definately worth it.
4,Entertaining Movie About A Dysfunctional Family,Little Miss Sunshine is the story of a dysfunctional family who embark on a road trip to get their homely daughter to The Little Miss Sunshine contest across the country. The story takes many twists and turns and has a great ending. This movie isn't hilarious but it is definetly entertaining and worth a watch. You will enjoy a few laughs and follow a great story line. This is an original movie and I highly suggest you put it on your to-watch list.
5,great inde of a full cast!,"This is a great movie! I wasn't to thrilled about seeing it in the theatre, but then after I did I couldn't believe how funny it was! It's important to have a great sense of humor when viewing this and an open mind is a must!"
5,would buy it again,i use it in a nikon D700 and it's wicket fast. super happy with it. have not maxed out the number of fps that i can go and have not tried to take the max number of shots on it to see how many i can fit in there.but sometimes i shoot jpg and raw at the same time and it has no problems keeping up. would buy it again and super happy with the purchase.
5,Great CF Card,"Purchase as a backup card for my Canon 5D. Works great. Not the fastest card but, for the price and as a backup it's great."
5,Love these Compact Flash cards!,They fit my camera and store a lot of photos. You cannot find them in stores any more. Love 'em.
3,no ATA support,"This card will not work for iPod CF conversions. CF cards need to be ATA compliant for this too work, and this one is not. I'm sure it's a nice card otherwise though."
1,Bad choice,I hav always liked Sandisk products until I bought this. I bought it for my Canon A10 camera. I also bought a Transcend 4 gig cf card. That one worked well after I formatted it. The Sandisk did not work at all even after I formatted it. I still don't know why.
3,The difference is obvious,"I was hoping this would be a much more affordable alternative to the Extreme III cards by SanDisk. And, by all of the specs and reviews I could find it sounded like it was a less expensive equivalent. It works fine, but I've noticed that it lags on faster shooting in my Canon 5D Mark II whereas the same 8GB Extreme III cards do not lag at all. I suppose you get what you pay for :) This would be fine for shooting portraits where you can take your time, but not so much for weddings where you cannot afford to miss the shot."
5,It does exactly what it says on the cover,A very good card I glad I got it. I bought for when I went to the Isle of Scilly so I didn't have to bring my lap top to down load all the time. I got well over 400 Raw photo's on it (I did lose count after a while). But simple as it had more than enough space on it.
5,Great Card,"Not the fastest card, but plenty fast for what I need.... It was shipped a day quicker than what was even promised!"
2,Sent it back,"Was expecting much more...not much I can say about it....except I sent it back....Still looking for a good ""use of marble in the home book""...any suggestions?"
2,not useful,"As a generic decorating book, this one barely passes. As a book on stone and marble it fails. This book does not fulfill what should be its purpose; it neither inspires not instructs. I did not learn anything new about stone and marble after reading this book. Plus, I've seen better pictures in catelogs. I would skip this book."
4,Only fits X3 harness if wire clips are cut,"Just wanted to post a general warning: for this kit to fit an X3 harness, the cable in this kit has to be disassembled and the pins have to be trimmed. You will need something to use as a pin extractor to push the pins out of the black housing so they can be trimmed and inserted into the existing pin locations on the back of your radio. The pins on the red/white, blue/white, and brown/white wires are too long and will not fit the X3 harness as-is. Once the long metal points have been trimmed off (don't cut the entire pin, just the pointed end), you can insert the cables into pins 3, 4, and 10 (respectively) of the small black clip on the harness where it connects into the back of your radio. Otherwise, works as expected!"
1,Hold the foul language!,Did not appreciate the foul language author used in throughout the book. Why do people think it is necessary to use inappropriate lauguage and cussing to get their point across? As a mother and a teacher I strongly advise you to hold off on the foul language. I found it offensive.
5,Not only for gaming,"I've got this mouse last Christmas. First I thought I would only use it for gaming but decided to try it for everything. First day was hard, as I was used to moving mouse all over my desk to move cursor from one monitor to another. With this mouse I'm able to do it in like 2""x1"" space. On the second day I felt happy because I could easily target anything on my screen with a sligh move. Now I always take this mouse when I need to use another computer for a long time as other mouses are too slow.As for gaming, in MMORPGs this mouse is great. When you want to turn any angle, you just move a mouse slightly and there you are. Right buttons are meant for dpi change and I advice to disable them for gaming, as you don't want to set minimal dpi in the middle of the fight. Left buttons are great, I use them for the most common actions."
1,Not a Good company or Mouse,"It is hard to reach the buttons on the side of the mouse, they are worthless. The drivers start a cyle of rebooting your system that never ends, system restore fixed that. But that is dangerous, your computer is completly unusable since it does not boot. Support did not answer any of the three tickets I sent. I could not ever download the new drivers and firmware since their site would not allow it. I restored my system and am asking for my money back.The only good thing is that the mouse movement feels nice, but the ergonomics and support renders it worthless. No good for gaming without the side buttons...what were they thinking. Oh one other thing the mouse is rarely recognized by the system at boot or when plugged in.Buy a logitech, never had a problem with my X700 and I have had it for over three years. Support has always been there and the side buttons rock."
3,Ambidextrous mouse not good for gaming,"It's that simple. I don't own one of these, but I can tell you the ambidextous design does not optimize contour for righties or lefties. It's physically impossible to optimize for both. If you are a lefty it may be the best you can do, but certainly righties have any number of better options."
2,Big hands beware... (also Mac OS X users),"I was hopeful about using this mouse for gaming, and its response time did deliver. It is more precise in it's cursor control than any other mouse I've used.However, it was apparently designed for someone with smaller hands than me. I find it's side buttons are difficult to use. They're very small and their action is not to my liking.Further, I was hoping that third party drivers would provide the ability to use all of the buttons when using Mac OS X Tiger. The Steer Mouse driver provided the best support and it supports everything except the right side buttons. I've found nothing that supports those buttons on the Mac platform to date."
3,"Great Mouse, short life","Well, the mouse itself I love, great for people with long fingers and used to default mouses and want an awsome upgrade. Very good dpi and response, and I like how the left side thumb buttons are sitting on my thumb so I dont have to move my thumb or hand bones to click them.However on to the bad. I owned one of these a year or 2 ago and it worked great for 6-8months I guess, and one day it just stopped working. I sent it in and luckily it was still in warranty so I got a replacement Mouse. But again same thing, after awhile the mouse just stopped working out of the blue. Really wish these things would last longer, I want to get another one but I'm afraid it will die again :(."
3,Needs OS X support!,"I am trying to use this on a mac because I have a 30"" screen and need the extra resolution and speed.Razor get some os x drivers out!"
5,Best Spanish/English Dictionary I've Found So Far,"I searched through a lot of Spanish/English dictionaries at the bookstore, trying to find one that includes comprehensible phonetic spellings (including marks to indicate which syllable is emphasized) for the Spanish word entries. This dictionary met that criterion.After using this dictionary for a while, I've come to appreciate other design strengths as well, including:- the cover is a nice flexible vinyl material that seems to be very durable,- the size of the book is perfect for portability (not too small though),- the word entries are in blue, while the definitions are in black (and are indented), making the entries stick out and easy to find,- the tops of the Spanish/English section pages are blue, while the tops of the English/Spanish section pages are gray, making the sections easy to locate, and- there is a section on verb conjugation (including irregular verbs).I think I'm going to buy another one of these to keep at work or in my car."
2,"Don't buy this one, buy another, says a Dutch Queen fan","It's a nice book and nothing more than that. All the anecdotes are well-known to Queen fans and they're found in every good Queen biography. But if you're looking for just another Queen booklet that helps you through the night, then buy it! Better books on Queen can be found anywhere..."
1,What the hell was that?,"I like Dracula. But this is as disjointed and downright strange a novel as I have ever come across. People behave in the most bizarre way, they seem to show no surprise at uncanny supernatural occurrences. What's all that stuff where they sit down and stare at each other? And the end - talk about an anticlimax! Read it. It won't take long. Then tell me what the point was."
3,"Not the best, but.....","I am an avid fan of Bram Stokers works and would heartily suggest this book to anyone who enjoys his writings. A library of his works wouldn't be complete without a copy.On the other hand, this is arguably his worst work of fiction. It was his last finished novel and his declining mental and physical condition is evident in the disjointed writing style. While I somewhat enjoyed the surreal nature of the work, other readers might become incredibly annoyed by it. I wouldn't blame them either.To summarize, if you are a fan of Stoker, pickup a copy. If not, you might as well skip it."
2,Dracula it is not!,"I had just finished reading DRACULA (after seeing numerous films I thought it was time I read the book) and was hoping for another good Stoker read with LAIR OF THE WHITE WORM....was I disappointed! The characterizations were weak, insipid immitations of Jonathan Harker, Mina Murray Harker, Lucy Westenra and Dr. Van Helsing, not to mention Lady Arabella/The White Worm, who couldn't begin to compare to Count Dracula! There's a ridiculous subplot where Lilla (derived from Lucy) is needlessly sacrificed, as well as mongooses dying left and right, which was just plain silly!I'm planning to read JEWEL OF THE SEVEN STARS, hope I have better luck this time!"
2,"Bram Stoker, but not at his best","Adam Salton, born and raised in Australia, is contacted by his granduncle in England, for the purpose of establishing a relationship between these last two members of the family. Adam travels to Richard Salton's house in Mercia, and quickly finds himself in the center of some inexplicable occurrences.The new heir to the Caswall estate, Edgar Caswall appears to be making some sort of a mesmeric assault on a local girl. And, a local lady, Arabella March, seems to be running a game of her own, perhaps angling to become Mrs. Caswall. There is something strange about Lady March, something inexplicable and evil.This book has elements that should make it a gripping story. Unfortunately, the tendency of the characters to move on, after a fantastic event, as if nothing unusual had happened gives the story a disjointed, surreal feel. This story just does not come together, but rambles along to its uninspiring conclusion. I do not recommend this book."
2,Very Weak Stoker-- A Fun Idea Poorly Executed,"This sounds like fun: some ancient massive reptile still slinks about the British countryside, seeking blood! Well, Stoker's paper-thin characterizations and clock-work plotting ruin an amusing premise. Turgidly written and nonsensically blocked out (characters seem like marionettes who move without reason from scene to scene), this is useful only as a look at Stoker's odd thinking toward the end of his life. As Victorian romance, it's barely passable, but it's a sad last effort from Stoker.See the movie! As usual with Ken Russell's films, it's cheerfully vulgar and over-the-top. And Amanda Donohoe makes a lovely ""White Worm."""
3,Very Odd,"""The Lair Of The White Worm"".....it is a very odd book.....it was written back in Victorian times but has a sort of modern feel to it....it is a hard book to describe....it is not as well put together as ""Dracula"" but was a rather amusing read."
4,great except for the ending,"This was an exciting CD, except for the end. The CD ended with Ponzi's getting a 5 year sentence. Then what?? According to web sites, he escaped from jail, did some more grifting, and before dying stated:I had given them the best show that was ever staged in their territory since the landing of the Pilgrims! It was easily worth fifteen million bucks to watch me put the thing over!Why the CD ended without detailing Ponzi's adventures after his sentence is a mystery. It hurts an otherwise exciting story."
2,No depth inside,"The mask in itself is a nice product, but don't be misled by the picture. There is no depth inside the mask for the natural features of your face, thus it keeps the mask from contouring to your face. From the picture, I was under the impression the mask would be flush with the skin...not so."
1,Junk - Don't waste your money. Picture is NOT what you get.,"Terrible quality. The discs are actually very, very flimsy frisbees. I have seen other sand kits where the discs are much heavier duty, ribbed plastic; that's what I thought I was buying. Most pathetic is that the discs that are to be used for the base of the poles do not have any indentation to receive the bottom of the poles. The picture of this product clearly shows an indentation in the center of the discs. I'm envisioning the poles sliding on and off the provided frisbees! Not what we want when playing. Why would Amazon allow this product to be so misrepresented?"
1,Terrible,"Whatever battery you buy, don't buy this one. It loses a bar of power every day even without using it. Talk on the phone for 45 minutes and you've pretty much wiped it out. After 5 months of use it spontaneously died - wouldn't charge, wouldn't work at all. I had to replace it with the original battery that came with the phone some 3 years ago (which actually works better than this battery ever did!).Complete waste of money."
3,Can't beat the price,"I have a Samsung A707 phone whose battery was loosing its charge rapidly. Went on line and saw this closeout. Bought a few of them for myself and family that have the same phone. Turns out that the batteries probably have the same shelf life that the original batteries have, ie, they lose power even though they haven't been used before. But, they don't lose power any faster than the original batteries, so I figure having a back up wasn't a bad idea. Just don't think you are going to get the same one to two year useful life out of these as you did the originals."
2,Poor quality battery - avoid.,"I bought 4 of these, since that was the same price as buying a single Samsung battery. I should've bought the name-brand one, since these don't work well at all! The charge meter on my phone is completely inaccurate now, shutting down shortly after getting to a single bar of charge left. Previously, it would go to no bars, and I'd STILL have an hour of talk time left. Even my ancient original Samsung battery works better than any of these generic replacements. AVOID!"
4,Coin Preservation,"This was a very informative guide to perserving old valuable coins. I picked up many tips regarding storage, cleaning (or not cleaning) of coin collections.I recommend this reading to new beginners and individuals who want to preserve what they have now."
2,MAYBE FUN IN MULTI-PLAYER?,"The title says it all, If you have never played a good RTS game, then maybe you will like this game, but for anyone who has played a game like StarCraft then you know how bad this game sucks. it was fun for like 2 hours or so, but i found it to be not very interesting at all. i only made it through like 4 levels or so before i had to call it quits. can you say boring. play World In Conflict instead. Maybe this is one of those games that is meant to be played multi-player only as it seems that would be quite enjoyable, but as for the single-player experience two thumbs down."
4,awesome... if you can handle it,"This game is a huge scale RTS, with literally hundreds of units on screen at any given time. But, as you might have guessed, requires a computer system thats outrageous. My brand new computer (custom built, better than alienware) can only handle the full graphics if there is less than 400 units total... and i've seen games where there were 8000 units total. the only other drawback, I think, is there is no such thing as a ""quick game"" or supreme commander. even one on one games can last an hour. but if you can handle the power, this is the game for you/"
4,Good game that could have been much better,"I thought the game was great considering it's been several years since it came out. I would have rated it higher if it wasn't for the fact the each faction is regurgitated on the same maps. I'm working on a second faction and it's the same maps with a slightly different story line but not by much. However, really can't complain considering it cost $5. I would have complained 2+ years ago when it came out. As for the game play itself, it is a very good game. Not sure how I didn't come across this when it came out many moons ago but a must buy for those who are into strategy type games like Command and Conquer and Starcraft. It is even more enjoyable because you can get it for $5. lol Also, make sure you pickup the expansion while you are at it. You can pick it up for the same price of $5 and it adds a little more to the original. Before getting Supreme Commander 2, you might want to look at the reviews."
5,Great game - no complaints.,"I've had a blast playing this on a modest system. I can't see why people are saying you need a $10,000 brand new PC with dual monitors to play and enjoy this game - IT SIMPLY ISN'T True!Buy it, play it, love it. I did and I haven't regretted it since."
2,T. A. fans will be disappointed.,"Total Annihilation fans: this is not a new and improved version of T.A. I tried single player skirmish. The zoom viewing is pretty neat, but the maps are boring and their terrain, including graphics, is mediocre. The screen movement is jerky and the maps blur while you move across. The mini map is not as good as the T.A. one. The assignment lines showing unit routes are awkward and confusing. I was disappointed. It was a waste of money. No doubt there will be a lot of used ones for sale."
1,Supreme problems,Admins on servers for Supreme Commander has a huge power trip if you don't agree with what they say about the game and players / admin / mods they will kick and ban you.The game has its flaws it is an OK game however there are several other RTS games out there without these flaws and that don't have power tripping admins. In fact GPG has a policy in place to REVOKE CDKEYs of users if they deem you a nuisance (don't agree with them)So do yourself a HUGE favor and stay far away from this.
1,Horrible RTS,"This game was intended to be pretty, nothing more nothing less. I played this game for a total of two hours before I realized its complete poop. Why do I say its so bad? Mainly because Each of the three sides have virtually identical units, the only thing I can find thats different about them is the artwork. Upgrading individual buildings one at a time is tedious and time consuming. Go and buy command and conquer three."
1,Sad extremely poor programming,Runs slow on a Dual Core with 2 GB of ram and 256 MB of video ram. It takes extremely poor programming to get this kind of a cr*****y game. Many other games run much faster while displaying many more polygons. The game play it's self of course is nothing new. Same old Starcraft knock off. Unit interaction is cumbersome considering most units are not visible if you zoom out enough to see their full firing range. Changing screen resolution does not help. I would go with Warcraft 3 over this anyday. Now If only I could return this piece of ........
2,Labor intensive,"I tried the Demo and while a cool looking game, it is way to labor intensive. Power/mass consumption is way out of line. I had 22 generators, 5 mass extrators and 8 mass fabricators with only a land factory and air factory and 5 defensive guns. Nothing else but it would not keep up with power and mass ??? I got overrun by the computer on EASY. Not fun."
1,I Didnt get the game only the empty case!,I purchased this game on amazon dot com and not only did it take 4 MONTHS for me to receive it but the case was entirely empty!
4,Just like Total Annihilation,"Its a better graphic version of Total Annihilation, so if you liked playing that game, you sure will like this one."
3,"Only extreme RTS fans need apply, recommend fast PC","Im an RTS gamer, and I thought this game had too much RTS. I recommend a fast PC. Im running SLI, 4GB Ram, and a Dual Core and I had choppy gameplay when the action got hot and heavy."
2,Okay but unblanced,"I didn't know this game was a sequel to Total Annihilation (one of my favorite games) so when I got it and noticed the similarities, I was excited. The game looks great and the battles and maps are huge.The bad side is game balance and strategy are lacking. Build a bunch of stuff and attack. Over and over. Air power is way too powerful so many games are a rush to see who can get air defenses and bombers up and running first.There doesn't seem to be much replay value. The races are very similar and there aren't many opportunities to try out different tactics and strategies to win. Build build build. Attack."
2,I ordered this?,"The previous reviews sum this up fairly well. I had a much better time playing the Rise of Nations series, including the quite enjoyable Rise of Legends. This isn't even the same ballpark as the greatest RTS of all time- Total Annihilation, so I was extremely disappointed AND out $40."
3,Was it all it was hyped up to be?,"I have been waiting for this item to release for a while. I was finally happy to see another widescale full-on total war game. When I go the game I was really upset about the type of mentorship program/tutorial. Instead of videos it should have been inter active. The program is a bit sluggish. Even on a quad core don't turn it to max everything. I love the nuclear explosions though, especially when you blow up the enemies supreme commander. Where it lacks for in detail it makes up for in theater of combat. The story line could have been better but it does leave room for a greater expansion. If there will be on."
1,A Supreme Dissapointment,"I was a big fan of Total Annihilation when it came out a few years ago.It was innovative in RTS arena and very original. So I was first to get this one.Let me just say this upfront, it was the biggest let down ever.Why?a) I have a 2.8 Intel with 1.5 gig ram and 7800 GF card yet the game was tottally unplayable on any map except the little tiny islands!!I had to turn the graphics to low setting to get the game to a decent playable FPS.So unless you have a dual processor with latest Video card this is not even worth looking at.b) The game itself:3 races that are amazingly so similar. Almost same tech tree.The game is just your average RTS game. The only thing unique about it is the HUGE battles you can have on MASSIVE maps! That will not happen unless you have power rig PC.So unless you have a high end dual or quad processor comp and LOVE massive battles, I'd skip this one.A Supreme Disapointment!"
3,Application,"I can it's a nicely constructed item, however, it claims to fit 2006-up Jetta/Passat/Golf. In my case I have a 2006 Golf and this does not fit."
1,do not purchase from Galaxy Entertainment,"this dvd was described as in""very good condition"" by Galaxy Entertainmentthis is a false claim by them. it is misleading and they should be allowed to make these claims. my dvd was full of scratches and the cover is well battered. it has obviously been used time and time again by hundreds of different people who do not care about their dvds. also they do not offer refunds. I would NEVER make a purchase from them again EVER! if you have any sense you wont either! that is why i dont rate them at all and give them no stars!"
5,THE HEARTBREAK KID?,"This movie is so good that if your watching it on commercial free t.v. you will end up holding it in if you know what I mean.And to think,I only watched it because there was nothing else on!"
2,Funny?,"I'm not sure I think this movie is funny, which makes me wonder why in the world it ended up on the American Film Institute's list of 100 Funniest Films. The ending was realing confusing, it ended and I was left to wonder... were they trying to make a point about something and I missed it? And I didn't laugh once throughout the whole movie. I don't think I even smiled. The thing about really great movies is that truly great movies don't seem dated, even if they were made 60 years ago. You forget about how old a movie is, that it is maybe black and white or whatever. Like The Odd Couple, which was made in 1968 (four years earlier than The Heartbreak Kid). The Odd Couple still stands up as true comedy and doesn't seem dated. The Heartbreak Kid to me seemed odd AND dated. I think that the voting group that voted for the AFI list just have a soft spot for Elaine May. And just because it is Neil Simon doesn't make it good."
4,"Well done, but don't get it as a date movie","If you want light comedy that will leave warm, romantic feelings at the end, you should probably try A New leaf (by the same director) instead of this film.That said, this is an intelligent, watchable movie that leaves you thinking back on the characters the next day."
3,"A Well Done, and Interesting, Tragedy/Comedy","This was the original, done a generation ago now; directed by Elaine May, and scripted by Neil Simon. Watching this, as I did after the remake, I was rather more taken with the serious side of the movie; which made this more of a disturbing, and even unpleasant, experience. Charles Grodin was excellent as the two faced husband, but the subject matter naturally is very serious. I would therefore recommend the 2007 remake by the Farrelly brothers, which did much more to emphasize the reasoning of the husband; yet in the end the conclusions were identical. So though it has been exceeded, I did yet largely enjoy the older film; and if one was to watch both, I would begin here."
3,take the rough with the smooth,"I found this film very troubling, because the acting is brilliant and the jokes are great, it's well paced and very visually pleasing. All these things made me really want to like the film, I just had some fundamental problems with the plot. The main character is so unlikeable I wanted bad things to happen to him from the off, and I sat there, secure in my mind that the consequences of his actions would be returned on him, and they weren't. The message of the film seems to be walk all over people, act in an entirely irresponsible and thoughtless way and you'll get everything you want. The ending felt entirely unsatisfactory."
3,informative introduction to sporting clays,"This book provides a good overview of the sport. The contents however is dated, and there is little of instructional value. Overall this can only be considered a primer for further reading."
5,Pleased with it!,I received it on time and in great condition! The book was very informative. A real pleasure to read. Brought some interesting phenomenon to light.
4,Great book for beginners,"Although I have some experience in the computer field (I am an IS student), this was the very first book I've ever studied Visual Basic from. I must say that it explains a broad variety of topics in a very easy-to-comprehend fashion. I was only somewhat disappointed that OLE and ActiveX were barely covered."
2,Keep looking for another VB book-Don't use this one.,"This book was recommended by our instructor for our Visual Basic Bus92 class at San Jose State University. Almost every student in the class (over 50), including myself felt that the book was of little help for learning VB. Many of the students went to the local computer store for a better VB book. It gave some good hints on what to watch out for, but nothing to brag about. I recommend ""Using VB 6"" by QUE publishing."
1,Don't Shop This Company,"I ordered from this company, took my order, took my money, then adjusted the order by refunding 1/2 my money, (still no product), took another week before they said they cancelled the order and was going to have to refund the other half of my money, still waiting!"
1,Avoid,"Don't buy it from Relax The Back. Charged my credit card and no mattress. They refunded money for mattress, but not for shipping. Still waiting for my $150!!!"
1,Terrible Customer Service. Dishonesty is their policy.,"Ditto like other reviewers. No email/phone/any notification was sent that order was cancelled, by them. For 4 wks. they kept telling when i called, in a very rude manner (yes, they do hang-up on you), that money was already refunded. It NEVER was. Forget any apologies for THEIR mistake. They are busy making interest on your money ""held"" ransom. Shamelessly ignore dishonest statements made in previous conversations and proceed to make false statements again! Whoever thinks paying big bucks will at least get you good customer service, you havent met these snobs. still waiting for refund after 6 wks..."
1,Worst Customer Service Ever,"This company provides horrible customer service. They charged my credit card, canceled my order without notification, and have refused to return my $150 shipping charge! Give me my money back!"
1,Horrible Experience,Like the previous reviewers. This merchant has the Most pathetic Customer Service!
3,"not terrific, not terrible, worth a viewing","I have not seen this film for a few months so memory is not completely fresh. There are a number of subplots and the weaving together is not entirely smooth, BUT there are some highly entertaining bits in this film. There's also handsome and talented James Fox, beautiful and talented Jacqueline Bisset, and sexy and talented Kenneth Branagh in his youth. Nice sex scene involving Branagh and I won't say who else, and he has a good comic turn with his character who is a jerk in some ways. I think the movie tries to cover too much territory with several plots that can't all be developed fully. However, there is gorgeous scenery in addition to the aforementioned stars, and it's fun, for the most part. Some mystery woven in, too, for those who like that. I do agree with the other reviewer who suggested watch this, then watch SHIRLEY VALENTINE which is even better."
2,Beautiful Greece/Awful Movie,This is a tribute to Greece with the most stupid script! Even the actors cannot save this little junket.
1,Save your money,This 'blanket' should be called a hankie. It is not big enough to use for a blanket--save your money and do not bother ordering this!!
5,A pregnancy MUST HAVE!,"These bands are incredible and a must have for all pregnant women! I work a corporate job and did not want to buy a whole new wardrobe of pants, so I wear the bella bands every day with my work pants unzipped and no-one can tell. They look like you are wearing a tight camisole and even help to streamline unwanted pregnancy love handles! I bought the 3 pack and have worn all of them several times. I literally wear them everyday. They are really comfortable and definitely buy the next size up - I ""was"" a size 6-8 and a size two is perfect. Fold them over in half for a tighter fit or wear the top half over your tummy like a cummerbund so it keeps warm in winter!! I am 20 wks and have been wearing them for 3 weeks now, so buy them as soon as you start having to undo that top button!!They are really good quality and I washed and put mine the dryer by accident and it didnt even shrink. Worth every cent!"
5,Great Buy - Great Look!,"I am so happy with my Bella Band bundle purchase, and so happy I bought the pack of 3. I was hesitant to spend the money on these but after searching the net for this and similar products figured I'd give it a try.BUY THESE EARLY LADIES! I waited until my 24th week to buy the bands and today slipped on a pair of pants I haven't worn in 2 months, unbuttoned and unzipped even, but nobody could tell with the bella band on. The look was cute and layered and not bunchy. The nice material even felt great under my shirt and no more belly button 'hole' showing!I'm going up to my 'skinny clothes' box to pull out items I can wear with my bella band on. I'm so excited to use this now and post-pregnancy.PS - they even came with a nice surprise bag of Skittles, heaven to me!"
5,Bellaband,"Bellaband is a must have. Prepregnancy Im a size 3 or 5 but I show very early because this is my third baby. I use it with all my prepregnancy pants and skirts and it works great and is actually more comfortable than maternity pants. I am a nurse and use it with my scrub pants untied not only is it more comfortable than trying to tie them under my belly but it makes everything , even the draw strings, appear smooth with no lumps and bumps.Im 18 weeks now and I still have plenty of room for the size 1 band to stretch."
1,Whiten Egret ear candles,I have used ear candles for years. When I saw the price for the quantity of ear candles I ordered them right away. You definitely get what you pay for. These ear candles burn very fast beacause they are very loosely wrapped. Therefore they do not work as effectively as a tighter bound linnen dipped in wax. I would not recommend these nor will I purchase them again.
1,DO NOT BUY,"I tried the ear canal removal with this candles.Please do yourself a favor, do not buy and don't do it. It will clog your ears more. I end up going to a ear, nose and throat specialist to get it clear up."
2,MEDIOCRE METAL,"Even the fact that FOUCHER is female and therefore without any real competition in this field cannot save this effort. I added it to my extensive collection of guitar orientated CD's because of the gender aspect, but this is such a poor effort that even the novelty value can't rescue this CD. The playing is C grade at best and lacks any memorable solos, melodies or grooves. To compare this to GARY HOEY offends me as a HOEY fan. There is a total lack of original chops or ideas and the playing is juvenile at best. If you like this kind of METAL CD, check out VINNIE MOORE / GARY HOEY / ANDY TIMMONS / ANDY GEROME or PHIL KEAGGY's cd 220. There are many more and this one would rate about 139 amongst the 140 or so that I have bought over the last 2 years."
1,Don't waste your money,"The product looked cool, but it was a piece of crap. It hovered on a linoleum floor for about two minutes. It couldn't really be controlled. It did not work over carpet, outside, or over water. Total crap. I will never buy anything from this company again."
4,First modern taxonomic revision,"""A revision of the lepidopterous family Sphingidae,"" by the Hon. Walter Rothschild and Karl Jordan. (With 67 plates). Issued at the Zoological Museum, Tring, March, 1903. (Novitates zoologicae. Vol. IX. Supplement, 2 v.

The sphinx moths have become the best know of the nocturnal macro-lepidopterans. This monograph is available for download from The Biodiversity Heritage Library."
1,WTF?!,"Why, oh why, would one spend $300+ on a cable that does the same thing as one that costs less than $10. Save the extra money and go take your family to dinner at a nice restaurant!"
3,"Good, but not better","I bought this CD on a whim b/c it was re-released (previously an import only) and I thought it would be just as good as Vertigo. I mistakenly thought it was a new release...hahaha. Anyway the tracks are similar with that mellow groove going on, but it's just not as polished as Vertigo. If you're dying to hear more from this duo then get it, just don't expect it to be at the same level as Vertigo....which I own and love =)"
5,Every song is a winner,"I love this album. Amazing songwriting, amazing voice and the eagles sing background on several tracks. Very cool! This album is on my ipod every week and is a standard for road trips."
5,", Interviewing, Selecting & Orienting New Employees",This is a wonderful overview of pertinent topics in recruiting and retaining employees. I plan to use it as a required text book in some classes I teach at a local university.
5,Great original and interesting jazz,"The creative and original arrangements and the ability of the musicians to blend with each other makes for very a enjoyable and inspiring listening experience. The band creates a very warm sound with great interaction among the musicians, and each musician has space to show all the hard work and contemplation they have put in over the years. Moreover, the message contained in the liner notes of the CD shows that Otto sees beyond the world of jazz and has a true concern for society as a whole. This fact clearly comes out in his music, in it's thoughtfullness and care. I've gotten a lot out of it and there's sure to be more to be found!"
5,Great Book,"This book is both simple enough to understand, and sophisticated enough to provide further understanding. If you are an second or third year undergraduate planning on graduate work, this book is a great way to catch up on advanced mathematics."
2,Not the greatest,Not a very good explanation of what I was looking for in this 1999 Guine. It could have been a lot longer and more throrough.
3,old age,This deal was not that pleasant. The information inside the book was great. I dont know how the book made it this far. It appeared to be in good condition until I opened it. As I read and turned pages they fell right of the bind.Better storage would have kept this book in great condition and made this a better experience.
5,Fabulous!,"This is an incredible preview of what will probably be a fabulous album as well. Dot sounds sort of Portishead-y, sort of Saint Etienne-ish. Lovely vocals, dreamy, trippy. Highly recommended!"
3,"Two tape set, one worth watching.","There are two tapes for this piece.The first is a history of Irish music in America. That tape delivers as an interesting and entertaining piece. The music is pretty good. The only complaint on this is the sound quality.The second tape is a performance of a play in Chicago... a sort of older version of Riverdance, but nowhere near that good. This tape could have just been called the History of Irish Music because there is very little dancing unfortunately. The second tape isn't that good mostly due to sound quality.This tape is overall worth watching, but don't expect Riverdance. Good music prevails though and gives this a slight recommendation."
1,Barely worth a star,"If you are a serious Irish dancer (I'm a certified teacher), you'll find this video set pretty dreadful and disappointing. Not particularly well done or insightful, and the dancing is really rather uninspired, for the most part. Don't waste your money!"
4,Steve Greatman,"I just wanted to add to all those ParrotHeads out there (Jimmy Buffett fans) that you'll see a very young Jimmy Buffett on the cover of this cd (I think I remember him using the name ""Marvin Gardens"") I've loved this album for almost 30 years now."
3,wanted specific recording of Lincoln Park Pirates,"For such works good, and some other decent songs. I am my own Grandpa is one, though I remember what must be the original version that I thought was better than this one?"
2,not worth the money,"This is not worth the money. I should have just typed out the phrase I wanted using word art or something, then printed in color and laminated....I would have saved a chunk of change. It's not just the poster, it's the shipping that makes it too pricey."
2,somewhat of a disappointment,"well..these light look real cool and come with different color lenses in case you want a different color, however the problem with them is that they simply don't last that long.the set comes with only two lights to start. One of my lights just stopped working after about 2 weeks and the other one quit a month later. replacements are not really that reasonalble a price when you consider they don't last long at all. There is no way to return to manufacture or get any type of exchange. its a nice little set and all that, good idea with a small switch on the hub, but the longevity of the actually light bulb is really lacking. I tried a different type of mini led lights by a different company and found that one to be of better quality and with a two year guarantee included, so I most likely will just buy more lights to add on to the second set, rather than order replacements for these."
3,cheaply made,when i installed it in the tank a slitly tugged the wire connecting to the light now it doesnt work. the other light works fine and is pretty cool
4,It is what it is.,"Well, it is a grammar book. How much fun could it be? This book takes my whole brain to read and understand, but if you are serious about acquiring the language it is one of the building blocks you will want to get involved with. I would reccomend using it with the dictionary by the same author because the language is written in so many different ways by different people. It will reduce your level of confusion. Best advice: Just keep going. Learn a little bit every day and it will add up."
2,I didn't like this album,"God bless these guys, but this album is low quality. I got this cd for 1 dollar so I guess I can't complain. I would recommend cross movement or grits instead."
1,So tired of this sound.,"I love Gary Numan. Always have. But his last few albums all have that dark, almost gothic, and gloomy sound. No offense Gary, but it's tired. How about an album of electronica (""Telekon"" of the new millenium)? Or a replica of ""Replicas""?"
2,A Sad Display,"In his time Gary Numan created some amazing music. Although he was not the real genius pioneer some make him out to be. Numan's early sound was heavily influenced by John Foxx. Numan was able to take the sound to a more accessible level and made a name for himself in doing so. Though most of his albums were variations on a theme, Numan was able to maniplulate melodies quite successfully. His mastery of synthesizer sounds in unquestionable. Unforunately Gary has completely run out of original ideas. Jagged is droning and void of any of Numan's creative techniques. The sounds are cliche and are not enough to prop up the poorly written songs. I have a warm place in my heart for Gary Numan. He was a big part of my early transition to alternative music. It's a bit sad to see such a clever artist lower his standards so much."
4,Gothic Synth Heaven,"Very simply, this and 2000's ""PURE"" are the best listens Numan has recorded since the 1980s. If you are a Numan fan, you will NOT be dissappointed in ""JAGGED"". If you are not, well maybe you should be - this is a really unique and interesting CD that sounds like nothing else that the music biz is belching out at the moment. Soaring melodies, sceaming synthesizers, and a touch of eastern influence....Oh, and don't miss the tour this Summer. Numan's charisma will take you by surprise."
2,Too much in the style of other acts...,"Gary Numan is now imitating other bands he helped give rise to, such as Nine Inch Nails. This album lacks propulsion and rhythm. It is sufficiently dark, but the songs are not particularly well-crafted. They feel like first drafts, as though Gary Numan recorded these in contemplation of future efforts."
3,3 Stars only becuase I'm a fan,"Most likely only Numan fans will think about buying this CD. For my part I was ready to travel 300 miles to see his concert - until I heard this CD.What a disappointment for fans and I think Numan. I have listened to it 5 times and it does NOT grow on me.Halo is the best track and should have been more the tenor of this CD. Numan singing slow dirges is pathetic.Sorry I really, really, really wanted any excuse to like this."
2,Old schooler disappointed,"I have been a fan since the beginning, but I am finding myself listening more and more to the old stuff, Telekon being my favorite. This album(Jagged) has a nice chunky sound, but I hate to admit, the songs sound the same to me. When I was in high school, I got razzed for my obsession with Numan (posters on the wall, etc), and I was told all his songs sound alike. I didn't agree with them in the 80's, but now the songs really do sound alike since the Pure album. I love ya Gary, but I hate to say it, I should've waited to find it at my local Cheapo discs in a year or so. However, I'll always be a fan and it won't stop me from going to see him (hopefully he'll come to Mpls again)!!"
3,"Good, but not great","I agree with many of the reviews left by users, that this is an ok Numan album with some great songs, but only sporadic. The album has some highlights for me - Halo, Haunted, Jagged - but there are also too many lesser songs that stop me from giving this album a thumbs up. If you like Numan's more recent work like Exile and Pure, you'll love this album, if you're looking for catchy radio-like tunes, stay away because you won't find many. You need the lyrics sheet at times to find out what he is singing about because the sound drowns it out at times."
1,Disappointing,"I must agree with Mr. Fulkerson,This album is crap. I have listened to it over 10 times and just can't obsorb it. If this is the best Gary could do for over 6 years then I guess I will have too pull out the old 1980 Numan records to really enjoy his true talents. On a positive note the song FOLD has potential to be a hit single.Armand"
1,The End.,"Nevermind that this album sucks big time the sound engineering is some of the worst I have ever heard!! reading some of the more sychophantic crap as you often get with Numans music, Jagged is not only a massive disappointment it is an insult to his ever decreasing audience who waited and waited until over five years for this badly produced collection of demo songs. God is the theme for sixty minutes, we are treated to barely audible verses and once the choruses kick in your speakers will distort such is the ineptitude of the man behind the mixing desk.Jagged is one long droning earache from start to finish, lyrically its sixth grade nonsense, as for musicianship apart from a mr dillion (ex NIN) Gary uses exactly the same piano/strings patch since his sacrifice album.I had bought tickets to see gaz live at Oxford but after hearing the forum gig bootleg my copies have been sold on ebay.jagged suffers from sheer laziness and total lack of ideas.STAY AWAY!!!!!!!"
3,Here we go again,"I've been a Gary Numan fan for years and I'll be seeing him on his current tour which I know will be great. But it would be cool if he could switch gears with his music already.When he started getting into his darker image and sound, I was impressed with what I saw as a sort of comeback after years of terrible songs. But now he's continuing to milk this thing for all it's worth. The last three albums really do sound like they were from one long session.I'm not a musician but I know writing great songs is very difficult. And if this is the best Gary has to offer, then I'll still have love for the guy and all he's accomplished, but I wish he could change things up a bit.Maybe some collaberations with Reznor or Manson would spruce things up."
5,Beautifully Dark,"I have been a great fan of Gary since 1980 and love seeing the evolution and maturity of his work. If you think any musician is going to keep writing in the same style for over twenty years with the same instruments, then go listen to a pop boy band. This album as well as Pure and Exile explore a darker area and more industrial unlike his earlier work which was more synth pop. Yes it is industrial, which may not be popular with the norm of society, however there is still a following. One thing that has remained the same, which is was draws me to his music, is his ability for a melodic chorus and transitions of his cord changes. It's a pleasure to listen to the interaction of the vocal melody against the music. Stay true to the music."
4,"Contrary to his own reports, Gary is not dead yet","Another agnostical outing in the vein of Pure and Exile. A little more subdued, however - the confessionals expressed in the guitar rips are given up more from resignation than torture. While his religious themes cover the same godless ground, the music is actually more diverse than on the two aforementioned predecessor albums. Gary's androidic wail, so prominent on Telekon, is in splendid form here, especially on Fold. Two versions of the track are included. I like them both, but I wish Gary had done the work to combine the best elements into one authoritative track."
4,Best Of Britain,"I 1st 'experienced ""Mr Webb"" AKA Gary Numan back in 1979. I was 14 and pimple faced... much like Gary.He understood my darkness and saved me from my morosenessbeing a fellow Brit, he spoke to me in tongues that made me feel less lonely. then at 22 I moved to the USA, leaving my Gary behind, but never forgetting him, having a fellow 'Numanoid' sending me all his songs as soon as they were released so as I'd get them before the americans...hee hee hee.This album is true to form Gary, he NEVER disapoints!For those diehards, I'll see you at the Irving Plaza NYC, August 7th 2006. For those of you whove never 'experienced' Gary live, be prepared for greatness... after possibly 45 shows, I can honestly say only once was it boring (eons ago - beserkerSee you down the front in black ; )tour)"
3,"Sadly, more of the same","As a Numan fan since 1979 I have watched the highs and lows of his career.It is difficult to criticise sometimes becausecreatively all artists go thru bad patches and you've got to accept that. This album sadly, for me, comes across as a disappointing extension of 'Pure'. There is not a lot new here, the opening track does not set the scene, in fact the first 3 tracks sound very similar. There are a couple of great tracks, 'In a dark place' stands out for me, but most of the album is, I hate to say, 'same old same old'. There is a distinct overuse of certain negative words (bleed,cry etc), which gets a bit depressing after a while. I expect an album to put you down then lift you up, then throw you of a cliff !! - I just felt down after listening to 'Jagged'. I expected something better than 'Pure', especially after a five year gap. Maybe 'Pure' is destined to be his standout album."
4,An interesting historical read,I had been looking for this book over the past year since I am a graduate of John Carroll University. Dr. Gavin's historical information about not just the University itself but the Cleveland area and the politics within the Catholic diocese is fascinating. I recommend this to anyone who graduated from John Carroll or who has an interest in Jesuit educational institutaions in the US.
2,Proportioned weirdly,"Both myself and my partner have tried this bad boy out, and in both cases we've found that the toy is just not made for realistic anatomy, and is really difficult to keep aligned correctly.When using it anally, the blunt end makes insertion *very* difficult and the knob is located WAY to deep to end up anywhere near the prostate; when used with a harness we discovered that the base is quite flimsy, and is easily pulled free from the o-ring, and that the toy gets turned around easily- causing the end to protrude into somewhat sensitive areas.Vaginal use yields marginally better results- the blunt end no long causes a problem, but it's still too long to hit the g-spot.The design looked like a good idea at first, but the execution makes this toy a big NO. I love tantus products in general, but wouldn't recommend this one to anyone."
4,A great way to learn from history,"This book is a great idea! Take one of the greatest inventions of the 20th Century and breakdown the framework that lead to its creation.The book is well researched and the author's conclusions about the Wright Brothers appear to be firmly grounded in fact and history. My only criticisim, and it is minor, is the book would have been a 5-star if the author had included more modern business management examples to support his 7 problem solving techniques. Curent business solution stories that parallell the Wright Brothers techniques would have really hammered the points home.Overall, excellent book."
1,Terrible Quality,"This is a terrible dvd. The video quality is terrible, its grainy and shaky like it was filmed in the '50s during an earthquake."
3,Good in its day,"Badly in need of a new edition, this books is 25 years behind in the life of a dynamic and energetic author, poet and education supporter. For a more complete biography, check out the one by David A. Groseclose, with a foreword by (the late) Michener himself."
4,Does the job,"Tired of having to find the right USB cable? Stashing multiple types of cables? This is what my wife needed for both her cameras - each camera had a different connector requirement. It's worked perfectly right out of the box. The only CON is that the winding mechanism is not designed for heavy duty, kid-style, whip-it-back-and-forth use. No, not my kids - I did it. Just to see how much abuse it could take. It does not take much to become twisted or out of center along the cord. Once out of center it will not completely wind up. It is fixable with a little patience.But, for regular use this USB cable rocks. Neat and tidy in a container with the adapters. We know where it is when we need it.Highly recommended. 4 stars because it's not truly durable - it is delicate."
1,Beware!,"reviews told me if I like lock stock and snatch than rockNrolla is the movie for me. I couldn't even finish watching the movie because I didn't have a clue what was going on. Also it was very difficult to understand what they are saying. I love Guy Richy's other movies (lock stock, and snatch) so I could barley wait for rocknrolla to come in the mail only to find in my opinion it sucks! If your thinking about buying this movie, i would rent it first."
4,Got what I came for,"Wanted more of Snatch & Lock Stock, got what I wanted. Nine more words to submit this review... dinosaurs minotaurs."
4,Rockin,Well written. Well performed. Well paced. Great time from start to finish. I truly hope Guy Ritchie makes a sequel.
1,A stinker,The trailer looks good -- I gave it half an hour and my $4... a stinker. If an action/comedy movie has almost no action and no comedy in the first 30 minutes - fah ged da bout it!
1,"Watch the trailer, skip the film.",Excellent trailer. Horrible film. I suspect this film died in the editing room.
1,What the hell was this?,"This film had great potential (in terms of casting) but was *seriously overstretched* (in terms of plot).1. The movie was really convoluted. (I can't go into the reasons for this here, since it would take too much space to synopsize the plot.)2. The number of coincidences that went into making this plot were just waaaaayyy too many to be believed. It is nice when a *few* incidents come together to make a storyline, but this was just over the top.3. Guy Ritchie did do good work with ""Snatch."" What the hell happened here? Ego? Sloppiness? Time constraints?4. The acting was good, as was the casting. There were even a few witty lines. It's just that even those were not enough to save the greviously stretched plot.5. Save your money. This is not even worth a single matinee movie ticket-- or even an overnight rental fee. When this movie comes out in the USA, it will probably be on public television in, say, a week."
1,This was really bad,I read some of the awful reviews on this movie but still took a chance because Lock Stock and Snatch were just so amazing. RocknRolla was really really bad. If you liked Snatch and Lock Stock then its worth checking out but dont expect it do be half as good as either one of those movies.
4,A review from a Guy Ritchie hater.,"Hate is a strong word. I just haven't ever liked any of his films. Something about the script is always too overdrawn and difficult for me to follow and believe. I've seen Snatch, Lock Stock and a few more. They all sucked I thought. RocknRolla on the other hand kept me awake 2 hours when I was supposed to sleep. It has some great performances and over a dozen characters. Nothing ground-breaking here but just a very entertaining guy flick. Well worth your time. I thought about giving five stars but then I I'm not a liar. Do watch this film. It's the best I've seen from the director."
4,RockNRolla,While this is a little less a keeper than Lock Stock and Two Loaded Barrels and Snatch it was still good enough to buy.RocknRolla (Single-Disc Edition)
2,Disappointing rehash of Richie's previous movies,"The latest from Guy Ritchie, who is now repeating himself. This movie was really good when it was called 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Guns'. And it was even better when it was called 'Snatch'. But now the formula is tired."
4,Rock n Rolla,The twists and turns make for a great ending. One of Guy Richie's better movies. They are definitely getting better as he goes further into the depths of talent.
4,I had no idea of what a RockNRolla was...,"lol... but really enjoyed this film. Guy Ritchie is the toned down British version of Quentin Tarantino (hopefully that gives you an idea of his style -- not quite as edgy, though). His movies are full of quirky characters, great dialog and really good actors. Like ""Snatch"" this movie was unique and odd. Great movie to buy or rent."
4,"Good Movie, but...","I Liked this movie since saw at cinema, I didn't like the combo because the only extra was de bonus dvd with a digital copy, nothing real interesting."
2,Tedium,"It's fast, it's snappy, it's lovely, it's high energy, it's full of fine actors. And it is dull, dull, dull.Sorry. I too really liked the well-known earlier efforts that crackled with wit and sharp photography. This is sludge in comparison. Not necessary to write a long one. And I see lots of people loved this. (Perfection???? Really?)But my wife and I sat through this without ever feeling engaged or interested. And wow, the surprizeroo ending...sheesh, sure didn't see that coming!"
3,Mr.Ritchie loses his zing but polishes his production.,"If Mr. Ritchie had never made lock stock and snatch, and I'd seen this from a first time director I'd be awarding the 4.5 stars it would merit..However, he's had a bit of practice and tunned out some great stuff, so this one is a little bit flat in comparison. Flat but shiny.A nice cast of some people seldom seen outside the UK was refreshing.You can see the comic has been replaced with the efficient holywood-esque. It's still good, has the trade mark plot twists, be thy less twisted, the action, toned down, and the characters, sanitized some what.. perhaps to appeal to a wider market ?I did buy the disc, so I'll watch it again a few times, but it won't see the use that the likes of his prior oeuvres will."
5,A typical in your face Guy Richie film. Awesome.,"This film just has so much to talk about it's hard to find a place to start. The character development is excellent and travels at just the appropriate pace that you'll find your character (or few characters) that you'll absolutely love throughout the film. The story telling is just great and the language is very appropriate throughout the film. To put it simply, this movie is hilarious and the pacing makes it even funnier. It goes back and forth from serious moments to silly humor and the contrast between the two makes some scenes ridiculously funny. One of my favorite scenes is the one with The Russians, no spoilers, but you'll know what I'm talking about after you watch it. Definitely a must buy and is one of those films you could watch many, many times without losing interest. Went into this movie not knowing a single thing about it other than it was directed by Guy Richie and I was not disappointed; and neither will you."
1,GERARD BUTLER YOU ARE BETTER THAN THAT,"I RENTED THIS MOVIE AND AM SORRY TO SAY IT WAS A WASTE OF MY TIME AND MONEY. IT IS DISGUSTING AND NOT WORTHY OF A GREAT ACTOR SUCH AS GERARD BUTLER. YOU ARE A TOP BOX OFFICE DRAW AND SHOULD BE DOING FILMS THAT DESERVE YOUR NAME. THIS MOVIE IS A GAY PORN MOVIE WITH VIOLENCE AND AN ATTEMPT AT COMEDY. NOT A WHOLESOME UNDERSTANDING OF HOMOSEXUALITY. I AM A GREAT FAN OF MR. BUTLER BUT WILL NOT BE BUYING THIS ONE. TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT. IT DOEN""T EVEN DESERVE ONE STAR."
1,rockngarbage,"I was expecting so much out of this film, but after viewing it, i was tempted to throw it in the garbage. First off, this movie is long, dull, full of british slang, which is not a problem as long as the movie is good. Bad, bad flick, i really don't understand the good reviews of this film. I am not ebert, but i can sure tell the difference from a bad movie and a good one, and yeah, this is a bad one."
5,Such A Fanrastic Movie!!!,"While this one flew under the radar and isn't one of Guy Ritchie's strongest films, this film is certainly amazing with a fantastic cast (including masterful acting by Tom Wilkinson, Gerard Butler and Mark Strong, as well as great supporting roles by Jeremy Piven, Ludacris and Tom Hardy). The soundtrack is also amazing, as all soundtracks on Guy Ritchie films are. There's a great mix of new and old artists and really make the movie what it is.If you're a fan of movies that will make you laugh and engage you with all the action and intertwining plot lines, THIS is a great choice.I will recommend the first time you watch it, you have the subtitles on to understand the plot better, but that's pretty much my only warning."
2,Rocknrolla,"As much as I 'm a Gerard Butler fan, I still can without bias say that this film is second rate."
3,RocknRolla,Was not expecting the movie to be this way. Since I bought this movie I have only seen it twice and was still unsure on the way it was gonna be. I need to see more times and hope it will change my mind. Great condition and fast service.
3,Good But Not Up To Ritchie's Best,I enjoyed the movie but it is not as good as Ritchie's earlier films such as Snatch and Lock Stock. Same type of setting... if you are a fan of the earlier ones this is worth at least a rental. If you are a big fan then you probably won't mind the purchase.
2,Loosing my Interest,Although I liked and understood what the author was trying to do with this story - the way it was written left me baffled and bored. It was too confusing at times and I lost interest pretty quickly. The transistions didn't seem to flow well and everything just seemed taped and glued together. I didn't finish reading the story - maybe it would've redeemed itself with a fabulous ending but I wasn't interested enough to find out
2,very basic,This is a very basic book on electrical.The drawings showing electrical hookups are misleading because that's not how an electrician would wire.You don't go in and out of a receptacle with the hot and neutral on the receptacle itself; you pigtail. My fear is that some home owner will try and tackle these projects with no understanding of electrical theoryor on the job trainingThe difference between electrical and other trades is that if you make a mistake you could be dead or burn you're house down.
5,excellent book,"Highly recommended- it has high-quality photographs and wiring diagrams, and good clear instructions. It does not dig very deeply into theory, but it does give some in context. I was able to complete a number of home projects that ordinarily I would have hired an electrician for. As getting an electrician to even return a phone call around here is nearly impossible, let alone show up, I needed a good reliable howto manual, and this is it.The Rex Cauldwell book is a good companion for this book, for readers who want the advanced course."
5,"This book saved me $4,000.","I used this book to completely wire a new bathroom. I used flex conduit and solid copper wiring to add two 20 amp circuits from my main service panel. I've never installed new electrical work before, but this book allowed me to install four receptacles, a pair of recessed lights, a pair of wall sconces and a combination exhaust fan/heater with no problems. Everything worked the first time I tried it (with absolutely no assistance from anyone)."
4,Good Information,This book has lots of good information for all sorts of wiring situations in the home. Very complete.
2,Goto bookstore and read first two chapters,"The first two chapters are well crafted and well written. After that, it seems book is reiteration of same points again and again. It is good idea which authors seems to have hard time backing it up."
2,block that metaphor,I found the book very difficult to absorb. It could be that I am just slow to get it. But I found that the theater metaphor often made it more difficult for me to pick up what they were trying to say. It certainly did not make it easier.
4,Insightful Look at Business Today,"This book definitely makes you stop and think about what today's consumer wants and expects. (In fact, it's easy, just ask yourself what you would want - what you're offering or what Walt Disney is offering). Businesses that don't make a lasting impression, offer an experience for the consumer will eventually go the way of the dinosaur."
1,Over-rated,"This is something new?! Tell that to Shakespeare, Barnum and Disney. Pine is confusing the ""experience"" economy with the ""entertainment"" economy."
3,Interesting premise -- but fades fast,"The concept of experience and its in role business is important. However the book treats the subject too lightly, I get the impression that all business will soon be DisneyWorld.The book's examples -- most focused on entertainment -- makes the concept appear trite and limited. Needed more real business issues and examples for my taste.I agree that experience is important, perhaps critical to the future--but this book does not give me much to go on."
2,Too Slow....,The Exerience Economy was way too slow and technical for such a dynamic subject. Joseph Pine undoubtedly knows his stuff but his knowledge was not delivered well in the form of a book.
3,not happy about packaging,Hi-the content of the book is very interesting but the I received it in a very bad condition (thanks to bad packaging?). All the corners of the book were damaged and it it is that I live in Holland: otherwise I would sent it back.Hope you will take care of this in future sendings.Regards Annemarie
3,"Zzzzz...yawn,yawn...huh?","If only the writers of this ambitious work had used the concepts they discuss in their writing and presentation. The amount of flawed reasoning simply has to be mentioned, it is unfortunate. Although I am passionate about the subject of themed entertainment, getting through this thick, dull, unexciting and at times logic-stretching book is calling forth every last reserve of self-will and determination. My eyelids get heavy every time I open this book, but I am determined to make it through. A marathon without water, sad to say!"
5,great Oregon history!,"As a child, I have to confess I enjoyed Lampman's fantasy novels more, but as an adult, I am only beginning to respect her talent for presenting history in a wonderful, entertaining way. She is especially advanced in her character treatment of Native Americans. ALL of her books are worth looking up in the libraries (as might be expected, libraries in Portland have more than usual). I don't understand why she is out of print, her books are wonderful for classroom reading. Any teachers, I highly recommend her books."
2,it could have been better,"It might be just my situation, but also a design flaw. I managed to lose the cap that came with my lens the week I got the lens and decided to get this as price seemed good. Unfortunately, handles on the side protrude in a way that does not allow using the cap when the hood is attached."
3,Inexpensive but functional,"I bought this Bower 77mm cap for a 300mm Takumar lens that I got recently. I did think about getting one of the more expensive center pinch type caps but I have them on a couple of other lenses I own and, while they are heavier duty than this Bower cap, I don't particularly like them and have trouble taking them on and off. This Bower cap has the outside squeeze tabs that I find work better for me and makes it easier for installation and removal. It IS an inexpensive cap but my first impression is it's a decent very usable cap especially for the money."
5,"FUNNY, FUNNY, FUNNY!!!!!!!","You have to watch this movie.....this movie was as funny as all hell for so many different reasons. I watched this movie with some friends and we laughed so hard we were crying at the the puppet sex scene.......Freakin hilarious.If you have the chance, you should buy the unrated version from Amazon (which is at a great price I might add)....the unrated puppet sex scene takes puppet sex to a whole another level........This movie is a MUST SEE........"
3,Minn Kota,"My third Minn Kota. I have broke every one! I waited for over a year towrite the review. And Yet another one broke. THe part that locks the motor up and down breaks on every one I have bought. After the warranties overs, of course. Other than that, this has power to spare. I have a big fat fiberglass boat and it pushes it with big winds. The motor is great. THe mechanism is cheap. Although this one bolts to the transom, and is heavy duty there.Its really a bummer. I end up drilling a hole, using a case harden bolt."
2,Incorrect Information,"When reading this book, I started finding errors. I stopped reading after finding 3, and do not recommend this book to others.The errors I found:1) Jody Foster was not the girl on the Coppertone billboards. She was in a Coppertone TV commercial.2) The Mae West film that has the dialogue ""Come up sometime and see me."" is not Diamond Lil but is She Done Him Wrong.3) Humphery Bogart was not the ""Gerber Baby"". He was, however, the model for Mellin's baby food and was known as ""the original Maud Humphery baby""."
4,"Excellent source for church ""Sentence Sermons""","Attention church ""Lettermen"", ""Signfelds"" and ""Vanna Whites""! This is a good source for church ""Sentence Sermons"", ""Highway Headlines"" and ""Roadside Revelations"". Have already used several sayings on our church sign myself! Among the better church sign books I have in my library."
4,Excellent and Horrifying,"I am going to be honest. I saw this movie on a Sundance Channel Horror special for the month, and I had no idea what genre it was at the time. Through the beginning of the movie, seems like a nice innocent film, but as the end approached the gorssness of the film emerges. I was scared! I have never seen Japanese horror before that. But this movie made me fall in love with it. The story and actors were good, the only reason I gave it only 4 stars was simply because I found the movie to be confusing at some points, but those were remedied after a second and third viewing. I suggest you see it if you like a twisty plot or just enjoy horror"
4,Unforgettable,"I was pleasantly surprised by Bravo's ranking this as the #11 scariest film of all time. I dont know anyone who's seen it besides myself, but this is one of those movies you'll never forget, the final 20 minutes are impossible to describe. The girl who plays Asami is adorable - even as she breaks out the piano wire and needles!!!"
1,the worst display of horror. ever,It was 2 hours of nonsense and 10 minutes of more nonsense. Save yourself the money and watch something else.
1,only a few minutes of good movie,"This movie was very boring. A middle aged man, years after his wife dies, does phoney auditions with promises of stardom with the ulterior motive of getting a young pretty wife. Bottom line he goes out with a nut case. The movie is 115 minutes. I kid you not 100 minutes of pure boredom. Man dates woman, goes to restaurants, small talk. Real boring stuff. But the last 15 minutes of torture was awesome. It made me feel nausea, which means it was good quality torture (it takes a LOT to make me react to a movie.) But was it worth buying and watching 100 minutes of pure boredom when only about 15 to 20 minutes was the only part worth watching? That's why I gave it one star. You can condense this movie into a half hour and not miss anything. Even 20 minutes."
2,Can't sleep ? Try this.,"I've watched a few seriously odd movies in my time. This is certainly one of them. I only stayed awake to watch this odd but missable waste of celluloid because I was bored to tears.This really slow train of a movie didn't even begin to rock for about an hour and a half. I'm usually a big fan of japanese minimalist no-frills kind of movies, but this would be better as a half hour Hitchcockian type of deal. This movie is too boring to be this lengthy.Trust me. Nothing happens until it's almost over. Your time would be better spent reading a phone book--- Ren ---"
3,Psycho girlfriends in Japan too? Nooooo!...,"Oh... my... God... A good pscyho girlfriend movie from Nihon!Well, his friend told him she was bad news. He was just too much in love to see it. Well, love hurts, right?All I can say is that if you find someone who's perfect in every way, except they have no past whatsoever, no friends, and people they associated with are missing, stay away from that person, no matter how good looking and nice they are.--..."
4,My take,"As a female, the scenes where the woman gleefully sticking needles in him and slicing off his foot with gusto are worth the price of a rental. It's a great revenge fantasy for every wrong men done to you and every pent-up frustration with men. ....kitty kitty...... ;)"
3,Hard to understand!!,"The movie was thrilling, but when it was over, I couldn't explain to a friend if I wanted to. Had a few friends watch it and when they finished, they felt the same."
3,The reviews are Better than the Movie,It starts out ok enough but this is no horror movie more like a drawn out drama. The 'horror' starts during the last 20 minutes of the movie by which the this film had already been heading to my trash bin.I have an appreciation for all kinds of films and dont critisize harshly but this movie was crap.
2,poorly written story,"The film is interesting for the first 80 minutes as it shows a lonely widower falling for a young woman. Nonetheless, it falls apart in the third act in a series of confusing and contradictory flashbacks, dreams, or hallucinations as well as a painful torture scene. I don't mind explicit violence when it serves a purpose such as telling a story or providing characterization. Here, the filmmakers show clever brutality without deeper meaning or resolution.A much better movie is American Psycho because it's violence and self-contradictions serve a storytelling purpose."
2,Nothing special,Nothing happens for the first hour and 15 mins. Then a mishmash of scenes leading to a confused ending. Disappointing.
2,Strange... and confusing....,Very strange movie... Waited for the good part... and just got more and more confused.Strange ending... would not recommend.
3,Average film,"The main character is a lonely widower raising his son alone in Japan. He and his friend decide to make a reality show to find him a new wife. Asami, a beautiful, soft-spoken woman impresses him so much that he decided to stop the show from being made and just jumps into a relationship with her. He knows nothing about her, and regardless of his friend's warnings, he keeps going on dates with Asami and starts planning a proposal. Although she seems geniune and kind, Asami is a anything but. I won't give anything away, but if you're squeemish with long torture scenes and gore, don't rent this. I found this film to be way too slow, and the conclusion was not conclusive enough. Just an average movie if you ask me."
2,"A missed opportunity: Great idea, incoherent direction","As many of the other reviewers have suggested, ""Audition"" had the making of a great horror classic. However, I found the direction to be completely incoherent, the production values very poor and the graphic violence completely gratuitous. There was very liitle buildup to the final showdown and, without giving anything away, Asami's motivation was never very convincing. Perhaps the incoherence was intended to unnerve the viewer? Anyway, this screams for a remake in the hands of a much more capable director with a bigger budget."
