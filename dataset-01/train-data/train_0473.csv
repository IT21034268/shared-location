2,A great example of how to create aquick ebook!,"Although this book claims to offer many ideas for earning money from the internet, most either lack sufficient information or assume too much prior knowledge to be much use to the novice."
4,A textbook for maiking money online,"The e Code truly is a textbook for making money online. It is loaded with helpful hints, tips, methods and ideas. This book will be especially useful if you are a beginner at internet marketing.Some of the opening chapters are a bit weak but stay with it and you will be rewarded with several gems."
1,Should be called 'how to spam code',"No solid information is given in this book. A vague idea is presented, and then the authors give a link to one of thier websites. It is almost as if they wrote this book to get more traffic to thier websites. Here is the plot of this book: Get a whole bunch of e-mails (they dont really tell you how) and then send them a bunch of e-mails promoting your product every couple days. Waste of time."
2,Don't bother with this one...,"Stale, painfully obvious information from the so-called internet gurus. Full of ""what-to-do"" instead of the more useful ""how-to-do"" information. If you really must get this type of info, go to the authors' websites. It's just get rich on the internet by telling others how to get rich on the internet. For beginners in ecommerce, there's very little in the way of detailed step-by-step instructions. For people with more experience, there's nothing new here, just a compilation of articles with the author's website address at the end of each one where you can actually buy the information they're telling you about."
1,Confused ramblings,"A shoddily assembled platform for Nash to propagate his confused worldview. The work isn't short on logically questionable bias. Most of his critical arguments take the form of exaggerating an opposing view to the point of absurdity. This would serve as a great political trick, but has no place in philosophy. Nash is also a bastion of arrogance in almost every chapter. I was particularly taken aback when he called Aristotle's god ""religiously unsatisfying"".He also argues that in the face of overwhelming evidence, atheists have no argumentative standing. He of course fails to present the ""overwhelming evidence"". In my opinion, his worldview is so old and out of date, the evidence probably consists of him actually attending the crucifixion of Jesus"
1,Not the best place to start.,"Shabbily written and loosely argued, this book is not the best place to start a quest for philosophical education. Nash typically conflates subtle issues, clumsily stacks the deck in favor of his pet causes, and then resorts to glaring logical fallacies. Readers who are really interested in learning about philosophy should look elsewhere. The Christian faith has many rich intellectual resources--but you won't find them here."
3,WRONG NUMBER SENT,I ordered what photo showed as the #13. I recieved the number 14. Was disappointed I was not sent what the photo depicted.
5,International ordering,"I was doing research on the legal regime for the Caribbean's integration programme, the Caricom Single Market and Economy. I was happy to have the evolution of the jurisprudence of the ECJ laid out in such a thorough manner which enabled me to draw linkages with the CSME. The cost of expedited shipping to Guyana, South America was worth every penny and arrived faster than promised."
5,Great Buy,High marks. A deeper understanding of the uncorrupted Word of the Living God. A great reference source for the hungry heart. Worth the money. I spent less than ten dollars.
4,Very good history of an important railroad electrification.,"The Milwaukee Road electrification was one of those technological marvels which, at its demise in 1974, still had both technical and economic advantages over modern diesel power. Holley did extensive interviews with Laurence Wiley, who had overhauled the system in the 1950's, and was one of the authentic geniuses of railroad electrification. It was a wonderful era, and Holley captured it very well, both in terms of technical description but also ""personality."" For anyone with a warm spot for what railroaders could do with railroads, this one describes a unique story, well told. The Milwaukee Road electrification spanned 60 years and 600 miles of mainline through five mountain ranges to the Pacific shores. Its electrics generated horsepower and tractive effort that GM and GE still, even with modern Diesel engines, AC traction, and power control technology, cannot match, and did it far more efficiently."
4,They need to rename the CD,"Although I love Dr Know and this CD....the name needs to be updated to ""Vintage Dr Know"". Sure, there are a bunch of songs I'd put on a ""best of"" CD but for them to overlook ""Wreckege in Flesh"" completely is an atrocity! (Had to subtract a star for that) I grew with Dr Know from their beginnings and felt ""Wreckege in Flesh"" was by far their best work ever. Awesome CD from start to finish IMO. Disappointing that it's not reflected on this ""best of"" CD when some of those old, very dated sounding and somewhat boring tracks were included. Oh well. Still a must have for the Dr Know fan. Go Kyle!"
3,Its killjoy....,"With Killjoy films expect 2 things. First and foremost the story line is very predictable. Second while entertaining and surprisingly effective at times,it only holds together for so long untill it becomes unglued. While i can definatly say this film has much more content and action then the previous films, they need to let the franchise die after this one. Watch with an open mind but expect only a few exceptional moments in an otherwise uneventful film"
5,Nice holder,"Sturdy, good weight, doesn't want to tip over. Is easy to clean too, since it's all open and reachable."
1,Toothbrush Holder made of sub-standard material,"When I received the toothbrush holder, I loved it. It is functional and matches all my satin nickel bathroom accessories. However, after less than a month of use, I noticed green corrosion spots appearing in the bottom drip area of the holder. I tried cleaning it, but the green is imbedded in the metal and cannot be removed. Everyday it gets more pronounced, so it appears I am going to have to dispose of it and find a different holder made of better materials."
2,"Steelhead Dreams a great book, but spend your money wisely.....","For anyone looking for this book and are discouraged by the price gouging on the used versions, take heart! Just spent a day with the author and he has a revision coming out. Not only will you get the updated version of this classic but it won't cost you the $$$$hundreds that some people would like you to believe a used version is worth. Save your money and support the author. Or better yet, take the hundreds that you can spend on a used version of this book and book a flyfishing trip with Matt! Eight hours on the waters of the mighty Muskegon with Matt will set you back less than what some people are asking for this book, used....."
3,From a professonal reader,"I read. A lot. That said, only half this book is worth the time and energy it took me to read it. The middle half, to be specific. The first few chapters are dedicated to Sachs detailing to us that, no, he's not an idiot writing about something he's had no experience with and that, yes, he can help to solve macroeconomic problems. The end chapters are all Sachs recapping what he said in the rest of the book with charts and graphs that start to become meaningless if you're not a economist or a student with a couple econ classes under your belt. The middle, in my opinion, is the only redeeming part of this book that mentions far too often big-names Sachs has met and important jobs he's held. The middle actually talks about his plan for ending extreme poverty by 2015 and how we can do it. The rest of the book is just padding. So read chapters 8 - 15 if you want to ""read"" the book. Donate money to an NGO if you want to do something towards ending poverty with your time."
4,Gameplan for extreme poverty.,I think this is a must read. Living in America where we have so much compared to the staggering numbers of individuals who have so litte. Extreme poverty is described as living on $1 a day. The book has a feasible and realistic gameplan for addressing the poorest of the poor. Well written and much needed.
2,What's new?,"Although I appreciate Dr. Sachs effort, his book lacked a new approach to ending poverty. It is a comprehensive, eye opening book for people without in depth knowledge of poverty and development, but for many scholars this book must have been a ""yes we already know""-experience. The book is more a moral ""we should""-appeal rather than a practical guide for people interested in ending poverty, because it does not offer new solutions. We have long known what we should do, on a micro level as well as in large scale programming, but how to actually make it work is a different thing. How do we get governments to meet the .7 GDP promise? How do we lower trade barriers, open markets, build infrastructure, gender equality etc. I will start ""The White Man's Burden"" today. I can use a good dose of grass root development realism."
5,Great Book,Very interesting book!!Gives us an idea of how difficult it is to advise completely different countries about how to stabilize their economies.IMF should listen to Mr. Jeffrey Sachs' advice.
4,Excellent book for any one with a conscience,"I am a voracious reader and hold on to a fraction of the books I read, I give them away after I read them because I just don't have the space to keep them all. However, this book I had to hang onto though I'd love to buy a copy for everyone I know. Sadly, many would never read it. But if you are at the place in your life where you are receptive to the idea that there is more to our life than ourselves; that if you are lucky enough to be born in the 1st world, you owe something to those who by the simple bad luck of geography were born in the 3rd world, then this is the book for you. Full of practical and eye opening information, every American citizen should read this book. Should be required reading our schools."
3,Interesting although somewhat biased,"ALthough he is correct that the IMF and World Bank can and should play a role, he should also advocate reforming these institutions so that they not only reflect the interest of the dominant capitalist countries. Politics has a role as well, and he must address the inherent contradictions within the Capitalist system that encourages capital accumulation, flight and waste. All in all and interesting read from an ""insider""...if you are looking for alternatives to the ""Washington Consensus"" then this is not your book. This book mainly advocates tweeking the international system (IMF, World bank, UN) to help alleviate poverty (which has political as well as economic reasons) but not changing it per se. I would have hoped that he would have taken on more the Capitalist world system and its predictable modern expression of it and its future trajectory."
4,Illuminating book on macoeconomics,"Did the last reviewer actually read the book? I am somewhat puzzled by his review since Sachs actually agrees with some of the reviewer's criticisms of economic policies in developing countries.In any event, whether or not you agree with Sachs' recommendations, the book is a wonderful introduction to basic macroeconomics and a superb review on the history and drivers of growth in developing countries. While I am not particularly interesting in public policy issues, this book made me want to care and expanded my thinking about poverty beyond the United States."
2,I have Not Received the Book Yet,"Hello:I ordered this book long time ago and until today, It has not come to my address. Instead, I received another small christian book; I placed it in the mail and it will be returned to you.In short, please send me my correct book: End of Poverty.Thanks,James."
1,"It should have been entitled ""The Start to Poverty""!","I'm Polish and I recall very well the ""shock therapy"" advised by Jeffrey. I have a very strong negative opinion about the plan because of the pain it induced during its execution and its result. I was just curious how Jeffrey will sell his ""work"" in Poland and therefore I managed to waste my time only to the chapter devoted to my country. Lots of hand-waving about the glorious path of Jeffrey!Well, as far as I know, Russian citizens (excluding maybe the richest 15%) feel the same about the ""shock therapy"" . I was just laughing about his description of himself as a savior of nation. The book is laughable and plainly factually incorrect (Martial law ended in 1983, not in 1989 and Poland regained independence in 1918, not 1919).But yes, Bono's introduction adds a lot of credibility!"
4,"Smarter than I'll ever be, but still...","Sachs makes some great points but spends way too much time patting himself on the back. He really has amazing ideas, if you can put that stuff in the back of your mind. He focuses a TON on the successes he's had, and tends to gloss over the countries and economies he made mistakes with. But it's a captivating read- you'll want to pick yourself up and change the world."
1,"THIS is the ""left"" of econimists? I am going to be sick.","Jeffery Sachs is no social justice activist. If your looking for real ways to end poverty, and dismantle the systems that create poverty, look somewhere else. What Jeffery does offer is a salve for the conscious of the worlds wealthiest.You see the problem with poverty is not that people have been ruthlessly exploited for years under colonialism and later capitalism. The real problem is that people don't have access to the market. In fact that exploitation, such as sweatshops and slave labor, are really the key to moving up the economic ladder! At least people are making something, we are told. Those women and children are so lucky to be chained to their workstations.This book is more an example of how to cherry pick data than how to raise a country or community from poverty."
1,yeah sure thing,"the man who has brought destruction to the Russian economy through the ""shock therapy"" and preparing the ground for his zionist jewish friends in Russia to own all the key national assets, now goes on to tell us what to do with the rest of the world...his books should be prohibited"
3,We can end poverty together?,"Poverty will exist as long as lazy people exist. Many governments don't help the situation, I hope Mr. Sachs' life-work helps change minds and increases the number of free markets and democracies in the world, but the idea that a bunch of hippie intellectuals will end poverty is ridiculous."
1,What a disappointment!,"What a huge disappointment! I am a long time fan of the Cat Who books, and although they have been declining in quality in recent years, still look forward to each new addition to the series. I enjoy the rambling tales of Jim Qwilleran's life in Moose County, with just a touch of mystery to keep things interesting. But this book has no plot, and the rambling doesn't take you anywhere. It's such a shame."
1,Wish I could rate this book with a zero!!!,Don't waste your money or your time...this book is terrible. What a disappointment for the loyal fans of this once-excellent series...and what a rip-off!!!!
5,Very Enjoyable!,"Maybe negative reviews generate other negative reviews, but this book doesn't deserve the low ratings it's received. I've read all the ""Cat Who"" novels, enjoyed them all, and found this one to be just as pleasing and interesting as the others. People have called it dull and boring; I didn't find it so, although ""dull"" and ""boring"" are relative terms. I don't think people read the ""Cat Who"" series for page-turning high adventure, but rather for pleasant, charming and relaxing entertainment, of which this offering has plenty."
1,The Cat Who Talked Turkey,"I think this was written by someone else, not Lilian Jackson Braun. It was terrible. Had no flow, was not interesting. Save your money, don't bother with this one!"
2,"Too much Qwill, not enough Koko.","Where's the mystery? Where are Koko and Yum-Yum? The best parts of the series - the cats and the murder - seemed to be included in this story as an afterthought. As I read, I kept hoping that something would happen, and I was disappointed when I started to reach the end and realized that this was it. I have read ""Short and Tall Tales, so the story about ""The Clipper"" seemed like filler. I haven't given up on the series, though, and I hope that the next book will be in the LJB tradition."
1,Not really a mystery,"I listened ot this on CD, and was extremely bored and frustrated. The plot is supposedly a murder mystery, but with the double homicide, the guy is more interested in a books store, the towns anniversary, and his cat being able to make a turkey call than the bodies pileing up. (Spoiler) Even the murderer is caugt by coincidence! (End of Spoiler) The main focus is on life in the small town, which felt nothing like any I've come across, or lived in, in real life. A annoying book"
1,Another lame effort,"This book is similar to other recent entries in the series-- disappointing. I agree with the other reviewers- the plot is lame, the ""mystery"" nearly non-existent. Once again, the main characters don't do anything to solve the mystery.How many clues does Koko find? None!This book is not worth adding to my collection. If you want to read it, get it from the library."
2,Dwindling appeal,"I thoroughly enjoyed previous entries in the ""Cat Who..."" series, but this one was very disappointing. In fact, I was so disappointed in this one that I pulled out a couple of older ones to see if my tastes had simply changed! No, the book just doesn't measure up. As another viewer commented - too cutesy, too predictable, too little mystery. I will look for subsequent titles at the library rather than purchase them in hardback. I hope this is just an oddball flop."
2,Where is that original warmth and flair?,"I agree with several other reviewers, wondering if this isn't a ghostwriter at work. Many portions have been lifted from other ""cat who"" books and the style is definitely different. If I had not read all of Mrs. Braun's other books in the series, I would probably not have looked for more after this one. While revisiting ""Qwill,"" the cats, their apple-barn home, and neighboring towns is still fun, I would never have fallen in love with all that from reading this book. I recommend it only to those of us craving the additional ""cat who"" experience, but not for its original warmth and flair."
2,Too Easy,"This can be a pleasant read for real fans of the ""Cat Who..."" series, but there isn't any mystery about it. The writer neverdevelopes any tension in the story, and the villains just appearand drop out without any real development, and this book isjust an easy story to read about the same ol' characters as inthe past, and nothing much really happens.It is like reading one of the more simple cartoons; not much to it,but it's familiar, so you can give it a glance, then move on tosomething more substantial.For the true fans only."
1,This was a Turkey!,"Don't waste your money! What a sad dissappointment this book was. The entire time I was reading it (and I even skipped some parts), I thought that it was more like a primative draft for a story. I just can't believe that Lilian Jackson Braun wrote this book. It does not reflect her style in any manner. Polly even makes comments that she would never make. I won't be purchasing any more ""Cat who..."" books. It's such a shame as Mr. Q, KoKo and YumYum were the best. The ghost writer should be fired... only after he or she has read all of the disappointing reviews."
3,News from Moose County,"This book was a pleasant visit to Pickax, Ittibittiwassee Estates, and, of course, Brrr. There was news about Qwill and his friends, time spent with his two cats, and tours all about Moose County.The mystery? It was the crime itself.In this installment of ""The Cat Who..."" series, the murder mystery is pretty much completely tangential to the story. Koko yowls at the appropriate times, we do briefly meet the no-goodniks who did the deeds, one had vague connections with the local folks, but..... If you took the whole crime thing out, it wouldn't have changed things much.A comfy, cozy visit with old friends, which I enjoyed reading, but not much of a murder mystery.And maybe Qwilleran should invest in a long piece of string and some super glue to help Yum-yum keep track of her toys."
1,What a turkey!,"What a disappointment! Love the Cat series, but this book seemed to be written by someone else. No plot, no mystery, no substance. The storm program was a pure bore! I just wanted this book to end! Don't purchase this... don't even check it out from the library. What a waste of time."
1,The Cat What...,I have been reading The Cat Who.. books for years and always waited for the new installment. Unfortunatly this will be the last one I read. The plot was nonexistent. The turkeys in the title had absolutely nothing to do with the book. the murders never made any sense. They weren't even named. I am starting to think that Lillian is not writing these books any more. Nothing in them makes sense. The book use to set up the next book. The last few books have not even been related. If you are a fan DO NOT READ THIS BOOK.
2,Ko Ko and Yum Yum have taken the back seats....,"With the new book, the cats have been relegated to the back seats. There doesn't seem to be much in Ko Ko's sleuthing behavior towards the crimes committed, and the crimes themselves don't seem to weave into anything much.I'm finding that the with past few books the author seem more inclined to write about the townspeople and events than the cats. Not that it's not amusing; it is. But the point really seems more centered on Qwilleran the do-gooder than Ko Ko or even the crimes. Also, the turkeys in the title don't seem to be tied to anything... how did they get introduced when they were annihilated before, and how do they tie in with the crime?I've read all of Ms. Braun's books. I think the earlier ones gave the characters more depth than this one. With this, one is left asking the motivation of the senseless crimes."
2,What does the turkey have to do with this mystery?,"I was disappointed in this book. I had started getting these books on CD from the library amd thoroughly enjoyed the first few I listened to. I enjoy the author's picturesque, almost poetic, descriptions of things. Those descriptions were still there, but they did not connect well. The mystery of the person murdered becomes an incidental by-line, not really crucial to the other goings-on in the story. There is no expanation to why the return of the turkeys is of any significance and what do the cats' being able to communicate with them have to do with anything in the story line. I felt very let down at the end of this audio book."
1,The Cat Who Talked Turkey,"It is so sad to me that the last several of the once intertaining Cat Who books have really been terrible. I'm now on the lookout for another ""series"" to enjoy, and I'll only buy another Cat Who book at the dollar store."
3,What mystery??,"When was the last time Qwill was personally involved in the book's main crime, as in he knew the victim, discovered the body, etc? It seems that in the last few books, we've just heard about a crime (murder, theft, etc.) second hand in a by-the-way fashion."
1,A Total Turkey!,"I agree with several other reviewers that this book was ghostwritten. After recently rereading most of the series, I checked this out of the library & was severely disappointed. The writing style isn't consistent, characters don't act ""in character"", even the standard re-describing past events doesn't fit any of the other books. Even Koko could've written a better book! The only reason I gave this a ""1"" is because ""0"" wasn't an option.If you must satisfy your curiousity, check it out of the library."
1,my head is spinning,"What's going on here with the latest books from Braun? I'm half-way through ""Turkey"" and I can't follow the story - is there a story? This book is terrible. Don't waste your money."
2,Turkey is the right word for this book,"I have read all of Ms. Braun's books and this is by far the most boring. She has all the qualities and characters of Pickax, but the murder mystery seems an after thought~ stuck in there after the book was written. She seems much more concerned about telling about the history of the ""Great Storm of 1912"" than interesting her mystery readers. It's about time Quill and Polly got a life, else her readers will."
2,Later Entry in the Series - About What I Expected,"Summer is starting, and the people of Moose County are planning to back in the excitement. First, there's the groundbreaking for the new Pickax bookstore, which Polly will be managing. Plus the town of Brrr is holding its bicentennial celebration, and Jim Qwilleran has agreed to write and perform a one man show about the winter storm that devastated the community almost 100 years ago.Oh yeah, and a dead body is found on Qwill's property.You'll notice the emphasis I gave on the happenings in the area versus the murder. I'm just following the emphasis on the book. Very little time is spent on the mystery and Koko's strange behavior. And the mystery resolves itself without any real detective work.Having said that, if you like the characters you will still enjoy visiting with them. And the book is short enough that you won't waste much time reading it.However, I can only recommend this for die hard fans who need their Moose County fix."
3,When will the mystery begin?,"I am a great fan of nearly all of Lilian Jackson Braun's books, but I have to agree with the other reviewers. Ms. Braun must have a coauthor. This book didn't seem to fit with the others. It took forever for the mystery to finally get started. I guess it is worth reading if you are an avid fan and don't want to miss any of her books."
2,So much left unsaid,"The 2 stars are for the charming goings-on in Moose County and the neighboring communities. I love following Qwill around, seeing what he sees, meeting the same characters he meets. But the tone of this book is slightly disturbing. The book begins and ends with the same murder -- a body found on some beach property Qwill owns. We never hear what happened. In fact, I'm not even sure Qwill knows for sure what happened. He doesn't seem that interested, so I wonder why I am. Likewise, he doesn't seem that interested in Polly anymore. There are two instances where something rather noteworthy happens in his life, followed by a call from Polly during which he never mentions these events. What's going on with that relationship? And the Big Storm performance left me rather flat."
3,Incomplete,"Jacob Burckhardt's main thesis is that the Italian renaissance marked the ""lifting of the veil"" for Europe, and sprouted forth individual genius. Yes, Italy was certainly politically and militarily chaotic at that time, divided into city-states that practiced ruthless realpolitik that would inspire Machiavelli to write ""The Prince."" But it was precisely this chaos that dampened state power, and permitted individuality and genius to flourish.I don't think anyone reads a book on the renaissance written in the 1800s for its historical accuracy and completeness, but I was frustrated at Burckhardt's complete lack of discussion of finance, the fuel that permitted the renaissance to burn so brightly. Missing that, I was hoping for a brilliance of insights and fine writing, and I failed to find those as well.Most modern writers have never heard of this writer and this book, and I think that's just as fine."
1,Civilization? Not!,"This was the worst purchase I have ever made at Amazon. The book is apparently out of print and consequently, was quickly printed for my order on the cheapest paper imaginable. The book was riddled with typos and there were no illustrations or maps-this in a book about Renaissance Art in Italy!I gave the book away without even finishing it. A terrible disappointment."
1,An Outdated Work,This is an antiquated work. I have disposed of it. It is not worthy of being on your list. I am a former college history major and this book was a major disappointment.
2,Warning - Multi-volume set (some editions),"First, let me say, I hate the idea of rating this book before I have read it -- it just came today -- but I was so disappointed that I received volume 2 when I was not expecting it, I wanted to warn others. Look at the product descriptions and most of them do not tell you anything about multiple volumes - and perhaps some of them have both volumes in one, who could tell? Just be careful. I had to go back and order volume 1 of the same edition (Harpers Illustrated Edition). Happily, I got it for a good price and, from what I have seen so far, and read in other reviews, this will turn out to be a very good book."
4,Not the best edition.,"Yes, this is still the standard for studies of the Renaissance. But the book deserves a better edition: especially one with relevant illustrations on the page. The best I've seen is the 1958 two-volume Illustrated Edition by the Perennial Library of Harper & Row: not only are all notes conventiently at the bottom of the page, but over 240 illustrations grace the text, usually next to the mention of the subject. Too bad it is out of print. I hope an enterprising publisher will rise to the challenge."
1,Will be seeking a refund -- typos on every page,"This review is of the edition of The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy published by BiblioBazaar. This edition should be recalled by the publisher: there are typo's on every page, making it nearly unreadable. I attempted to continue reading the book (which is of course a classic) but was too annoyed with trying to figure out what certain jumbled characters meant.I think BiblioBazaar must has scanned the text of an old edition of the book whose copyright had expired, but then never bothered to proofread the finished product. Very bad business. Save your money and get an edition by a reputable publisher."
5,A classic Gospel album from the heart of the Lord,"This is Rev. John P Kee at his best. Every single track will minister to your spirit man and draw you closer to God. 'Let it Go' is about forgetting the past and moving on with God, 'It could've been me' is about leaving the worldly way and living right for God. This album is a definite one to have in your collection, every track has a message and you will find yourself dancing and singing along. You are truly a blessing Pastor J P Kee."
3,Helpful for extra studying,"My daughter was taking a course on Finite Mathematics. We used the examples and solutions to help her review for the final exam. It was very helpful in 2 areas: (1) linear programming - graphical approach and (2) Matrix algebra and its use in solving sets of linear equations. In her course and her textbook, they covered financial math (interest, annuities, loans, etc.) This book had nothing so it was a slight disappointment in this area."
4,Helpful,"I found this book helpful in the course that I took in Mathematical Economics. It was a useful accompaniment to the text used in the course, Fundamentals of Mathematical Economics by Alpha Chiang."
5,5 STARS!!!!!!! Yes it DOES conjugate ! It is GREAT!!,"The reviewers who say it only conjugates 1st person, or present tense only, havent read the instructions. It conjugates tenses I never knew existed! You just have to know which button to push. Mine has gone backpacking with me, and has been dropped on a ceramic tile floor. It is still going strong. I will exchange my 501 Verbs and my VOX spanish/english dictionary for another one in a second :)Amazon, I gave this 5 STARS, not 2, first time around. What happened!"
4,Quite Good,"Excellent display with great lexical information, including idioms and differences between Spain and Latin America. Conjugation function, though helpful, is limited to first person only. Spelling correction is great though a little clumsy, as multiple forms of a dictionary entry are treated as possible spellings that must be chosen from. It has a user customizable word list to help you keep track of new words, but it is limited to only 40 words!!"
2,Where'd the slang go????,"I just purchased my third one of these. The first was stolen, and the second one broke inexplicably and wasn't covered under their warranty. The great thing about this dictionary is that it had, i repeat HAD, such a wide variety of words. Now, since it is no longer Larousse but Merriam-Webster, it has absolutely NO slang. None!!! In other words, it doesn't have crap!! I'm not even talking swear words (which the old one had plenty of), but it doesn't even have silly words like fart or barf. This may sound ridiculous, but these are words are part of the average persons vocabulary.I thought about returning mine, but there's really nothing better out there that I know of. And I'm studying Spanish lit, so it's kind of a necessity. It's fast and has a lot more words than your average Spanish-English dictionary."
5,Big Improvement,"I bought this item to replace a DBE 1440 that wasn't working correctly. Although the buttons are a little small, and I have small hands, it works very well. The thing I like best about this model is the vast number of words and phrases that it has, including slang and even ""dirty"" words. Expensive, but worth it!"
1,WAIT! Don't buy this one!,"After 5 days of minimal use, this pad stopped working. Kaz replaced it. After 3 days of use, the pad stopped working again. Kaz replaced it again. After 7 days of use, the pad stopped working a third time, but this time Kaz VOIDED the warranty! Then, they said I should get an electric blanket if I wanted to keep warm. I wonder if they really think an electric blanket and a heating pad are interchangeable for soothing a headache or backache!"
4,not hot enough isnt necessarily a bad thing,"i have this pad and for the most part, i like it. one problem with it is that its a little too thick for me. But thats only because i have a broken back and have had rods attached to my spine and they are slightly curved forward instead of being arched. So , i need my back to be cradled and this does the opposite. But i do have an older one which does not have the safety shut off switch and gets WAY too hot. Ive been seriously burned by it and appreciate this pads feature. Also the massager is just a vibrater but it helps to get the blood flowing, which is what its designed to do. Its not going to give you a deep tissue massage. I think the settings are good. One is low and one is high. if it were any stronger your whole body would be vibrating. i paid $35.00 plus tax which is the only other thing i didnt like about it. it should be cheaper. $25.00 including s and h is a decsent price. And its warranted for two years!"
1,Not worth the money JUNK!!!,I purchased this heating pad hoping it would be long lasting.. After about a month it is all but junk. It will not vibrate and the heat is to low to feel anymore. Plus with the way it was made the heat after a while shrinks the pad up into a ball of plastic that just makes it worse. Do not buy this item!
1,hate it,"Way too thick to lay on, awkward position for my back. It doesn't get hot when the heat is on."
1,No heat,"The product description is misleading. The massage part seemed to work, but it did not get very hot, only warm."
2,I should have listened,"Welp, you get what you pay for. I though people were over exaggerating about it not getting hot enough. Truth is my other heating pad's low setting gets warmer than this one does on high. Of course the massaging is not all that great but that is the one thing I did expect. Where the power cord goes into the heating pad is already splitting and I've had this product for less than a month."
2,"Cute, not sensible","It looks very attrative with anything, but the quality is below horrible. It's not very sturdy to walk in and I have the experience of walking and dancing in 5 in heels with out stumbling. Not made for the everyday woman; just a couple hours, no more, at a sit down dinner only."
1,DO NOT BUY............NOTHING EDUCATIONAL,"DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO, THIS IS SUPPOSE TO BE FOR TODDLERS AND IT DOES NOT SAY THE TITLES OF THE SEASONS, JUST SHOWS THE WORDS LIKE THEY ARE ALREADY SUPPOSE TO KNOW HOW TO READ.POOR QUALITY AND SOUND!!! i WISH THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A REVIEW BEFORE I WASTED MY TIME."
2,bad molding,"This moulding is very cheap, but in very bad quality. The machine made rope moulding is supposed to be smooth. But for this one I received, it is very bad, especially the corner part, too disappointed."
3,Has nice lyrical passages but weak in history,Starts off very well with the account of Paz's first visit to India. But I was shocked at his defence of the colonial history of Mexico when he makes comparisons between India and his native country. His understanding of Indian history is rather shallow. Paz was a good poet but no historian.
5,this is the movie that made me a Pedro Infante fan,"since i first saw this movie several months ago i became a Pedro Infante fan. In my opinion this was a great movie and has become my favorite of his films. Pedro was such a versatile actor. He proved he could play any kind of role. this movie was funny,entertaining and sometimes alittle sad. Sara Garcia was great as the grandmother who adores Pedro,her grandson."
3,Pretty good Pedro movie,"I like Pedro Infante movies, despite my best efforts to the contrary. They're funny and fairly easy to understand for those speaking Spanish as a second language.The only fault I had with this movie is the female lead--I just didn't like her at all. The female ""villain"" was a much better actress, and far more beautiful. I swear there's a point in the movie where you can see the female lead's very faint upper lip hair; faint but definitely dark. If you're a fan of Pedro's movies, this definitely has to be a part of your collection. But if you're trying him out for the first time, I would go with Cartas Marcadas or Los Hijos de Maria Morales."
2,A Step Back for Trivial Pursuit,"This version has a number of esoteric and poorly written questions. My biggest complaint, however, would be the apparent commercialism. Is it possible that companies payed Hasbro to have their brand name on questions? One fitting example asked which two letters in amazon.com's logo are connected by an arrow."
2,"They Got the ""Trivial"" Part Right","Yikes! There's trivial, but then there's ridiculous. If you're over 30, playing this game is laughable. So obscure are some of the questions and answers -- that it's really more of a guessing game than one that tests your knowledge. It's too bad, since previous editions are fun. And sorry, I agree that the card dispenser can be a bit aggravating -- just give us the box to hold the cards in!!! Why fix it if it ain't broken?"
4,Very fun,"I have played this game several times with 30 somethings and very much enjoyed this new edition. My biggest complaint, however is that there is only half as many cards as the previous edition. In addition, I am sure that an English major did not write these questions, as many are confusing and have to be re-read. We did not find the questions that difficult and completed our games in an hour or so."
4,I wasn't as smart as I thought,"Yes, I agree with the other people who responded, however, I like not knowing the answers. Gives me a chance to learn more.We had a lot of fun playing this. Things that we knew and thought were so obvious weren't to the others...I enjoyed the game. But, if you think you know everything and don't like to be proved wrong, this may not be the game for you."
4,"If you try it, you will buy it.","Due to the poor ratings for this game, I was not going to buy it. I had heard that it was too hard etc. HA! It's great. Some of the questions are tough, but if you're child of the 70's & 80's, you'll be surprised at how much you know.I totally enjoyed playing this game."
1,Big Disappointment!,"My family and I were excited with this new edition, the commerical looked really fun, but that's all there is that is fun about this game - the commercial.First, the board is flimsy - they ""cheaped"" out on the construction and still charge $29.99 for the piece of junk.Not to mention the pie wedges are also made from thinner plastic than the old games.Second, they made this new card dispensing box - you have to murder yourself to get one card out or end up bending the cards, this is too time consuming, we ended up just leaving them in a pile on the table.Finally, the questions are bad. No one can figure out the answers to these obscure questions.So don't bother wasting your money on a cheaply made, poor question, not much fun game."
1,Who can play this game?,"This game was rediculously difficult to play. I think I answered,in one game session and not including the multiple choice questions,six questions accurately. Who is this game really geared towards? Not the average adult, and I flatter msyelf to say that I am an educated man. This game had questions that, unless you are a scholarly person who keeps up on every tidbit of information, you would never know the answer.I think they should come up with an edition that is geared towardsd the more everyday individual. What do you think?"
2,are they kidding?,"I played this at a party with about 10 college-educated 20 and 30-somethings who were initially so excited about it. Everyone lost interest w/ the game in 20 minutes b/c it was sooo hard and instead it became a contest to try and get a single question correct. We were lucky to have some other options and just went for a round of The 80's Game instead - I would rather overplay that one, than struggle with a game that is no fun at all."
2,Too difficult-stick to genus 5,"I'm all for raising the bar, but they just over-shot it with this one. My boyfriend and I are both great at Trivial Pursuit, and sometimes it only takes 45 minutes to complete a game, but this game took us 2 and a half hours. And I forfeited. I know what trivial means, but the questions are beyond trivial. It's just too hard to be fun. Educationally speaking-the questions are so hard that when you find out the right answer it's so obscure that you can't remember it. If you are a trivia collector or something like that it's worth having, but for fun on a Sunday try one of the other editions."
2,WAY TOO DIFFICULT!,I RECEIVED THIS TOY LAST WEEK FOR MY BIRTHDAY. HAD A FEW FRIENDS OVER LAST NIGHT FOR A GOOD OLD GAME OF TRIVIAL PERSUIT. THE GAME LASTED OVER 4 HOURS! THE QUESTIONS ARE WORDED HORRIBLY! WE WILL DEFINITELY SWITCH BACK TO PLAYING THE OLDER EDITION.
4,HARD!,"I thought I paid better attention in the last 20 years!We thought this game would be a ""gimme"" but it's not!We play it on ""Family Game Night"" which is pretty cut-throat at my house. All of us found it difficult. We'll play it again, but we know what to expect now!"
2,Don't believe the TV commercials,This game is not nearly as interesting as the TV commercials imply. The questions concern quite obscure subjects and are not very fun.
1,This game is VERY difficult,"We bought this game thinking it would be in the same lines of the Genus IV edition, but with questions from the past 20 years. We would end up asking all the questions on each card to see if anyone could get even one question right. We went several cards before anyone got any questions correct."
1,Boring!!!! It should get Zero Stars,"Yuck! I am so disappointed with this game! The questions were not interesting as the tv commercials would have you believe, they were wordy and about obscure topics, the same can be said about the categories- they are very unclear- you don't know what type of question you'll be asked-but on other versions you do know what type of question you'll be asked. We also had trouble with card sorter- it would hand out 3 cards at a time. Also the board is very very flimsy and dull. I wish I could give this game zero stars."
1,Our Biggest Holiday Disappointment!!,"I paid nearly $... for this game, excited for the new version. Five played--ages 30 to 57, college educated and well traveled folks. There are many things I could say about this game, but fun, durable, fast paced are definitely not the descriptive words I would use. The questions are poorly written, difficult to understand and well beyond the definition of trivia. The board is flimsy, hardly even lays flat. We have to order the card dispenser which was ""temporarily out of stock due to high demand"". Why bother! This game will not be played again in our house. The earlier versions are fun. This one is a joke. If I could take this game back I would! ... Believe me---listen to the bad reviews. I wish I had!"
1,Excruciatingly badly written questions,"At first my sister thought that I had forgotten how to read, but then we realized that whole questions were mis-worded and some answers clearly wrong. Example:Q: Who succeeded Trent Lott as Senate Majority Whip with the defection of Jim Jeffords?A: huh... do you mean House whip after DeLay or Senate Majority Leader after LottMe: let me check the answer and see what they really mean.... Oh the me Senate majority leaderA: Tom Daschle... this game stinks.This was repeated often. Some questions are trivia of various difficulty. All are basically extended current events related. Several are so obscure that there is no way that anyone could know them. The latter are undeducible and absurd. When the answer is read there is a long pause followed by a big ""who cares"" from the players. This is a very frustrating game."
1,annoyed,the questions were long . not to the point. The questions were very hard. A friend of mine A Harvard Grad could not answer even 95 o/o of the questions. Save your money. Don't buy it.
1,Stick with the Older versions!!,"We had a party of 12 people, excited to come play an edition that was supposed to be from our generation. 90% of the questions were so abstract that no one had ever heard of anything to do with the answer or question. It felt like whoever authored this game was stretching to find tidbits of trivia from the past 20 years to finish this game. We only finished the game because we had good food and drink to help tolerate such a difficult game. I'm donating mine to the Goodwill and going back to the editions we've had for years. Next time they decide to create a new game, they should get real and find trivia that more than 1% of the population has heard about!"
2,The Millenium edition is much better,"I was very excited by this version from the commercial, and was very disappointed when I got it home. I really like Trivial Pursuit and I love the Millenium edition, and I thought this would be great for anyone who grew up in the 80s, but first of all, this has to be the cheapest board ever made by trivial pursuit. I enjoyed all the real life photos on the millenium edition and I thought this version would have some too. Also, the categories are obscure and the questions aren't very interesting or entertaining. If you were only going to buy one version of trivial pursuit, get the millenium edition for sure, I wouldn't even recommend this one as a second or third best. I hope this helps."
2,Questions are too out there!,"We bought this game hoping that for once there would be a Trivial Pursuit game that was not too difficult, since we were born in the 70's. This game still proved to be full of questions that we had no idea what they were asking most of the time let alone what the answers were! We are both university graduates and we both felt pretty stupid!!! Maybe the 80's edition would be better for us???! If you were in touch with many of the world events of this time frame you might do better with this game."
2,Don't waste your money,"I picked this up on clearance, but I still think I spent too much. The older versions were made of much sturdier material; the cards the questions are printed on are very flimsy compared to the original game. The questions are okay, but many are very obscure. Trivial Pursuit is a great game and it's one of my favorites, but this version is a dud. Save your money if you have the older version; it's still a lot more fun to play."
3,"Well, it is called trivial for a reason...","Being a fan of all things trivial and trite, I own (through thrift stores and garage sales) even the original Trivial Pursuit and its companion packs. Naturally, I purchased this version (you can never have too much trivia). However, I was somewhat dissappointed.It's not a matter of how trivial the information, nor how difficult the questions, but rather--how poorly the questions are written. They are written in such a convoluted manner that my boyfriend and I give each other credit just for understanding the question at times. The question content is extraordinarily obscure at times, but they are generally diverting (who knew that Saddam Hussein wrote romance novels?)I can't help but lament--if they had just hired a better proof reader, editor and writer for the questions this edition would have been one of the best in a long line of Trivial Pursuits."
1,Not Trivia but Factoid Debris,"The old Trivial Pursuit, as well as the Baby Boomer Edition, was tremendous fun. Most of the time, when one got an answer wrong, the correct answer at least gave one the feeling: ""I should have known that."" Not so with this game. Anyone who consistently gets correct answers in the 20th Anniversary Ediction either has entirely too much time on his hands, or spends that time reading, watching, or listening to inconsequential garbage. I got the game for Christmas, have played four games with various people, and only enjoyed it when the game was finally over."
1,"Trivial Pursuit is a good game, but not this version...","The questions in this game are fine. They did seem a little more difficult than some other versions, but my complaints are almost solely on the design. The board is flimsy. It feels something like one of those games you might cut out of the back of a cereal box, and there are maybe half as many cards as in the standard versions. What you are paying for is the fancy-schmancy plastic card dispenser that doesn't work! You're supposed to just slide a card out and start reading, but you usually end up holding two or three. What was so difficult about taking the cards out of a box? The game is a classic. You don't need to redesign it every time, just make more cards."
2,Don't buy this if you are under 40!!,I recently recieved this gift for Christmas and played it with family. The kids (under 14) had trouble with a lot of the questions even though they they are cultured. The adults ( 30's to 50's) also had trouble even though they too are well cultured. Overall the adults had more fun because obviously they were around when these facts were collected and every time at least one person knew the correct answer. The kids also surprised us when they answered questions that you could only learn by watching TV or reading some magazine. Occasionally they would know the correct president who did something or correct rock star. But overall I would not buy this game for a crowd under 40.
4,The Card Dispenser Rocks...,"The votes are in and all my family and friends agree... The card dispenser that comes with this 20th anniversary edition of Trivial Pursuit absolutely rocks.A lot of the questions are a little obscure, but at least the film and music category is easy, and if you are a sports buff, so is the games category, and if you read a lot, the written word is probably not so bad... Anyway, most people find at least one or two colors they feel comfortable with, but no one should expect to know everything."
2,20th Anniversary Edition,"Most of the questions in this game are ridiculous. The old trivial pursuit used to actually be about knowledge, but this anniversary edition asks questions you could not actually know the answer to, you just have to guess. For instance, 'which Charmed star likes spam sandwiches?' It's one thing to not know a piece of information but it's entirely another to be asked about information that isn't knowable. Most of our fun was had talking about how ridiculous the questions were."
2,Questions Are Hard!,"Maybe I'm not old enough to remember EVERYthing from the past 20 years, but I thought that I might have had a good shot at it. This game was way too hard, though. I think if you're a trivia buff then this might be the game for you, but otherwise the questions are way too...well, trivial."
1,Not what I expected,"First, the game board is flimsy. Now the game play: it sucks. This version of Trivial Pursuit is billed for the younger crowd, all questions being from the past 20 years. Well the questions suck, having little to do with everyday life in the past 20 years, and this game is completely boring. I bought a couple as Xmas gifts for friends, and returned them all after playing ours."
2,Kinda Tough,"This game was too difficult for my group. We played it once, and sold it. I'm a pretty major trivia buff, and I thought they were tough....The rest of the group felt many questions were impossible. Be prepared to play for a while."
2,Questions have gotten more difficult,"I bought this game for Christmas and my family refuses to play it again. Nobody knew any of the answers. Trivia is trivia, but these are things nobody knows."
3,Harder than you think questions,"I couldn't wait to get this game, and I took it to a party with friends right away. I was disappointed with how difficult the questions were...the"
3,"I know it's ""trivial"" but come on...","I love the original Trivial Pursuit but some of the questions in this new edition are random beyond belief. They don't test knowledge, brain power or even trivia retention. They seem more designed to shock you or make you laugh but they certainly are out there.Also, the pieces are the same (ie durable and fine) but the board feels like it was fashioned by splitting old boards down into their elements and letting a second grader stick them back together with glue."
4,loved it,We played this game with a bunch of 30-something people on New Year's Eve. We really enjoyed it. The questions were not as obscure as the other Trivial Pursuit games we have. At least we had a shot at answering them. I recommend it to anyone who remembers the past 20 years.
5,Ignore the bad reviews,This trivial pursuit game is wonderful. There are many questions that I can answer that I learned simply by being alive. The people who don't like the game must have been sleeping for the last 20 years. This game is easier than the others and is a lot more fun because the questions relate to topics and occurrences that I actually remember.
3,Want more stupid questions? You got 'em.,"It astounds me that this game is considered educational by some. At best, it will educate you for a round on the now-defunct game show ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire."" I'd say about a third of the questions in this edition are worthwhile, a third are so obscure that only a handful people on the entire planet stand a chance of answering them correctly, and a third are pointless trick questions where the goal is to find out the trick in the question rather than test your knowledge. Remember...they don't call it ""trivial"" pursuit for nothing. If you already own another edition of TP, pass this one up...there's nothing here you don't already have. Only worthwhile for the collector, the trivia freaks, and those who have never experienced TP before and want to see what all the fuss is about. Everybody else should take a pass."
3,Slightly disappointed,"The game is still fun, but many of the questions are so incredibly inane that no one would ever know them. Who really knows who wrote the default ditty that plays when Microsoft Windows boots up? The board is low quality and flimsy; it won't even lay flat on the table, so the dice don't stay on it well. Another reviewer implied that only uneducated people would think the questions were too hard, but my husband and I are both finishing out master's degrees at Emory, and we both found the game boring and frustrating."
1,Don't waste your money,"We recently bought this game to play at a family gathering. We have kids in their 20's who were always discouraged playing the Genus edition because many of the questions were before they were even born so we thought this might be more age appropriate. Boy were we wrong! The questions were so trivial that there was no one at the table who had even heard of many of question's subject matters. In reference to one reviewer, no we did not expect easy questions but we did expect that with people in age ranges 20's to 50's that someone would have heard of the subjects. The questions were so convoluted and wordy with unnecessary garbage that by the time the last part of the question was read you had forgotten the first part of the question. Don't waste your money."
2,NOT fun,"I am 28 years old and was excited to get the 20th anniversary edition because I thought the questions would be more current and applicable for my demographic. I was very disappointed...a large amount of the questions are very obscure and some are so confusing that we had to read them 3 times in order to grasp the question.The game is also kind of cheap looking as the board and the cards are very flimsy, compared to previous editions.That said, you can still have a good game if you have a lot of time and patience and don't mind laughing at some of the random, obscure questions. It's fun to get questions about old TV shows you used to watch, current event questions that are still ""current"", etc."
2,not like the commercials,"I think the game is frustratingly hard. Other versions are much easier and more enjoyable. The commericials make you think the questions are about sheep and Kato Kalin, not rocket science. I'll probalby sell mine ...!"
4,Fun and frustrating,"The nostalgia and gathering with friends is what makes this game fun. We had three people playing ranging in age from 32 to 40. We found the questions to be very difficult, and in over 2 hours of play answered no more than 15 questions correctly. The game definitely is not what the product description leads you to believe. However, for some reason I do look forward to playing again!"
1,Listen to the reviews!,"Don't do what I did folks. I read the lousy reviews, decided I needed to find out for myself, bought the game that night, and guess what I found out? That I just wasted money! This is NOT your fun, yet challenging trip down memory lane for 20 to 30 year olds like I thought it would be. The questions were impossible to get answers to, took the fun right out of it. The commercial that advertises the game is very misleading; instead of showing pictures of Michael Jordan and Clara Peller, they should be showing the Wall Street Journal and Newsweek Magazine. In fact, this game is ideal for those of you 30somethings that did NOT spend any time watching TV or listening to music when you were growing up. Instead, you were glued to CNN."
4,Loved it!,"As someone who dreaded playing the original Trivial Pursuit, I wasn't too thrilled when I got the 20th edition for Christmas. I played it with my husband, sister and brother-in-law. Usually when we play Trivial Pursuit my sister and husband kick butt while me and my brother in law watch TV and pretend to play the game because we know none of the answers. Well, with the 20th edition my brother in law won in about an hour and I came in second place. With the old Trivial Pursuit we never finished a game becasue it took forever. Needless to say we found this edition to be much easier than the old one. We have played with 20, 30 and 50 year olds. The older generation didn't like it as much, but the 20 and 30 year olds loved it. I agree that the board is much cheaper, and we don't even use our dispenser, just pass out a stack of cards to each person, but we really enjoy the questions."
1,Disappointed!,"This game was so difficult. We played with 8 adults, all college educated ( with Masters Degrees ) ranging in ages from 25 to 38. We all found the questions to be poorly worded and difficult to read. Most were also impossible to answer. All 8 of us agreed we had no desire to torture ourselves again with this game. Warning: This is no Genus Edition!"
2,Extremely tough,"We bought this thinking we had a chance to get some right. We were so WRONG. This game is hard, if not impossible sometimes. We are 25 and struggle with Brown (virtually impossible to get any right unless you get lucky) and Yellow. It is very expensive at ..., the card holder is very nice, it can be used for blackjack also, but the board is not very durable. You'd think for [the money] they would have a more durable board. I reccommend it, but be prepared for games longer than Monopoly!!!!"
1,Major Disappointment,What a disappointment. I purchased the game for the holidays. We got ready to play and were very disappointed. The game board is flimsy and cheap. The questions were seemingly from the last four years and dull. I will probably give it to the goodwill as no one has any interest in playing this verison!
1,Lousy Game,"This game is extremely hard. I purchased it for my husband for Christmas. We played with 10 college graduates in the 40-45 agegroup. I think we correctly answered 1 out of every 20 questions. We finally just gave up with the ""winners"" having only 3 wedges. The questions are poorly written and so ridiculous that nobody would know the answer. This was a severely disappointing purchase. I wish I could return it."
1,So Hard and Frustrating,"I bought this game to play with my boyfriend and his parents. After 2 and a half hours we gave up, citing the fact that none of us knew any of the answers to these extreemly obscure questions. The entertainment questions were ok. But we were stuck on the written word for about an hour."
2,Not as fun as other Trivial Pursuit Versions,"Trivial Pursuit has been a tradition in my family since I was so small the only contribution I could attempt was rolling for my team. I have played the old Genus edition, the Baby Boomer's edition, the new Genus edition, the kid's edition, the millenium edition, and I had the misfortune of receiving the 20th anniversary edition for Christmas this year. What a waste of money/time. Everything in the negative reviews below is 100% true. I am at the tail-end of Gen-X, have an IQ over 140, stay fairly current on events of the past 20 years, but most of the questions were so obscure they gave me a headache. The ones we could answer were totally obvious. The new Genus edition and the millennium edition are ten times more fun than this horrible game. Playing a game should make you happy, not upset you! I would highly recommend avoiding this version!"
4,Great Time,"It's funny to hear people give a bad review of this game, because they had a hard time with the questions. Don't be mad because you lost the game. We had a great time playing this game with 20,30 and 50 something participants. The questions are just from the last 20 years so you have to be up on your recent trivia. There is a good mix of questions in this game, easy and challenging. The dispenser is great too!!!!"
2,Inane and Obscure Pursuit!,"If you know what three genus and species crosses were used to develop lettuce in 1998, you'll be able to answer the questions in Trivial Pursuit 20th Anniversary. Gathering with family and friends for a game of Trivial Pursuit is always a blast- except with this edition!Packaged in the usual square durable colorful box, the box invites you to play what promises to be a fun game of question and answer. Except the questions are incredibly obscure and nearly impossible to answer. The usual game components are there: sturdy plastic trays to hold the durable cards, the triangle chips, and circular holders for moving around the board.The question categories are split into "" World View, Sound and Screen, News, Pages, Tech and Game On"". I don't know how they came up with the questions for this game but it is not an easy one! If you like tough games, try Trivial Pursuit 20th Anniversary!"
1,Listen to the negative reviews and avoid this edition.,"See all of the negative reviews? Notice that they're all saying the same things? Avoid this edition!I'm just going to be repeating what everyone else has said. The questions are obscure, poorly worded, and uninteresting. It's as though the people who make Trivial Pursuit just slapped together another edition to cash in on the brand for the holidays.Save your money and buy another edition!"
3,I agree.... Questions are very hard...,"Although, yes, the questions are supposed to be hard, it is not fun if noone ever gets any right!The fun of the original and others is that some know it and others don't. This one takes too long to play becasue it takes too long to get any of the answers right. I'll stick with my other versions."
2,Completely trivial trivia,"My family has always enjoyed playing Trivial Pursuit on holidays but when we recently played TP 20th Anniversary during a family gathering, we were very disappointed. We thought that this version might be a little easier for some of the younger family members that wanted to play along with the adults. Like many of the others that have reviewed this game, we too found most of the trivia so obscure that it nearly made the game unenjoyable. In addition, many of the questions seemed to be worded so poorly that we could barely understand them, much less answer them. I recommend sticking with one of the previous versions of this game. They were much more enjoyable."
1,Worst reading of a book-on-tape I've ever listened to,"This is not a review of the book; rather, it is a review the performance given by whoever read this book on tape. It is, quite simply, the worst reading of a book on tape I've ever heard! The reader's southern accent makes her attempted Irish accent sound like something more suited to a Saturday Night Live skit in which the joke is how bad the Irish accent is. It's almost impossible to listen to after awhile. In fact, I can no longer hear the name Billy without hearing the ridiculous parody of an Irish accent that this reader employs endlessly. So who makes these decisions? Would it be that hard to find someone with an actual Irish accent for a novel with the theme of Irish ethnicity at its core? Would it be that hard NOT to choose someone with a thick southern accent? Hello?"
4,"Interestingly different view, with historical perspective.","After all the hype and techno-babble about the Year 2000, I found this title very refreshing. It not only put the change of century into perspective from a religious and spiritual viewpoint, it opened my eyes to some of the nonsense being talked about in media I don't normally listen to.I thought it was a very good, brief, overview of the reality -- minus all the silliness. (Perfect length to read on a plane flight, by the way.)"
3,more words!,"most of the words in here I already know... Franklin should produce a dictionary of more obscure, academic words. but it's good for spelling, I guess...."
3,"Great Price, Nice Packaging, Subtle, Soft, Powdery Smell","Bought this strictly for the look of the packaging (it comes in a glass orb that is quite nifty and desginer label (diesel), one of my favorite brands. Was dissapointed at first smell, since I did not get to test the cologne, this was my own fault. The smell is very powdery, almost feminine, but I can smell the cinnamon and wood as well that masks some of the powdery smell. Overall it's a Good buy for the price but if your like me and like a more masculine smell, I would suggest the Diesel Green for almost the same price."
4,Get more for your money,"It was not the first time I purchased Diesel Zero.I have a difficult skin, I mean, several fragances that I like on my friends do not smell quite the same on me or the smell do not stay long enough.That was not what happened with Diesel Zero. The wooden smell was just the way I appreciate and the fixation is quite good as well. Besides that, the price is very affordable in comparison to other good brands.I truly recommend you to try it. You won't regret it and may even get surprised with the results."
3,Zero Plus,"I love the design of this cologne. The cologne itself is nice, but it has a strong musk and it is almost if the cologne has a bit of a peppery scent. One of my friends said it reminded him of mace. I would wear this cologne out and about, but would not wear it to important events or places."
4,hola,"sobre este articulo no tengo critica alguna estoy totalmente conforme y satisfecho, hasta me gustaria comprar otro, cuando aparesca otra oferta......."
1,waste of money,it did not worth the money paid for it. it was not a good a choice and I will not buy it again
1,not happy,"i think they should pay more attention to the quality of the packaging, the sprayer stopped working on the second week, and the bottle is still full."
3,cologne,I was impressed first by the delivery. I bought it on the 12th and it was delivered by 13th through free shipping option. I got it for my husband and I am real skeptical because I couldn't smell it before purchase. However i like the fragrance. It has a manly smelly...
1,"Product is a knock off or B-grade reject, avoid",I still have the bottle I'm replacing (almost out) and the new bottle design font and smell do not match. Avoid at all costs. Would have returned but the product arrived one day after the return cutoff.
1,producto falcificados,compre 11 perfumes y me llegaron destapados y derramado todo los frasco se le quito la pintura y no tienen olor a nada
3,not the original,"Ordered it for my dad as a gift. He likes it but then again he doesn't really know the difference between the real thing or the impostor. It looks like an impostor, the smell doesn't even last that long, but like I stated he couldn't tell so ""Oh, well"""
1,Not Great,I bought this cologne un-sampled because my favorite scent is actually made by Diesel so I figured this could not be that drastic of a difference. I was very wrong. The closest thing I can compare this too is the smell of bug spray. I am not exaggerating on this and still love my other Diesel cologne scents I have smelled. I am going to end up throwing this one away though (unfortunately). Buyer beware if you are a fan of the brand and have never smelled this before. Hopefully this helps someone else who thinks they may be purchasing a different scent. Happy hunting.
1,It smells like a knock off.,This is definitely not the cologne I remember it to be.It seems like it was filled with a knock off that smellsobnoxious and unattractive.
3,Powdery...,This cologne Diesel Zero Plus was a little on the powdery side. This is something that's just not for me.
2,It reads like a text book instead of a devotional book.,"I was wanting a devotional book that compared my 2 favorites, Krishna and Kali. Instead it is a boring text book style writing. I wasn't able to finish it."
1,Pure Junk!,"I purchased this item, and took it back in two days. It says in the directions to blow the dead insects off the electric grids, with a hair dryer. Which I don't think a hair dryer could get the job done anyway. The other problem is when you unplug the device most of the insects that were on the grids would fly away! The grids are not strong enough to kill the insects, they just keep them alive, and stuck to the grids! As soon as you turn the item off, the insects all fly away! Bug Zappers that I have owned in the past would zap ever bug that entered, and you would hear the zapping sound. Not this one, it might zap one insect an hour or so, but the rest would all still be alive! It has a Black and Decker Name on the box, BUT IS NOT MADE BY BLACK AND DECKER! It's made by a no-name company that came with a 800 number for 7 days a week customer service, but they were always closed no matter what day or time I called! So please do not waste your time or money on this item !"
3,Cleaning the BZ115 bug zapper,"As all others I became frustrated at cleaning all dem critters out but found a solution: medium difficulty: Remove the pinch plate that protects the bulb from bottom of housing. Carefully remove the bulb by slightly pull and wiggle action. Remove four screws from bottom plate. Remove the plate. Then remove four additional screws holding the bottom section to the rib cage. Remove the bottom section and presto, them critters will be all over the place. I used a high powered yard blower to blow out the carcasses and hosed off the separated parts: bottom section and bottom plate. Realign all the parts and secure with the screws. Be sure to realign the bottom section bulb access to the interior bulb plug-in."
4,Works well for different applications,"For my purposes, I like the fine, close together wire vs. large mesh (Small bugs just fly right through the large stuff & I don't care about killing June bugs).I use the product indoors in an animal room, or in the kitchen. It works wonderfully for fruit flies & other small, pesky flies.As one reviewer said, why would you want to attract outdoor insects from the surrounding areas?As far as cleaning goes, I can't see that a blow dryer would work, but an air compressor does the job nicely.My complaints about it are that it's only available seasonally & is difficult to find even then, & that one of mine lasted less than a year & quit zapping the bugs, & the other's plastic hanging top broke under its own weight.I like the other reviewer's idea for zapping fleas :)"
1,Worst Published VERSION of Novel EVER,"This version of this novel was absolutely horrible. there were pages of passages with symbols and punctuation marks in place of words. missing sections, misspelled words. it was completely ridiculous to try to read. this review has nothing to o with the content of the story. THAT is extremely important and relevant to women's studies and racial equality on early America. this version, however, was awful"
1,Incomplete,"So this is just volume II, correct? Perhaps it should say that in the description because it is only a bit disorienting beginning in the middle of things.Here's the google books pdf of volume I: [...]And volume II: [...]It would have been nice to have them both in a single book--or at least for the printer/seller to have printed volume I rather than II in a single volume marked simply /Hope Leslie/...that makes sense, doesn't it?"
1,IT STUNK!,I read this book and hated every word of it! It was hard to read and the plot was stupid. Save your time and check out some other books!
1,The worst book written,This is possibly the worst book written all time. Why is it studied? Should we just Fahrenheit-451 this drivel? I think so!
5,Great show!,"This English period drama is refreshing. There is suspense, drama, intrigue, romance and beautiful sets and costumes. I wish I had more time so I could catch up to season 3."
5,Great show,"I really love this show, The UK version is awesome. Love the clothes and the actors, would recommend this to anyone."
5,Great Show,I had heard so much about this show that when I saw it was available on Amazon Prime we decided to give it a try. It has been great.
4,"Forget the hype, just watch it.",I didn't realize how much of the world loves this series until I stumbled upon it. The pilot was enough to get me to watch a second episode and to me they get better and better. One thing I like is the character development - the actors do well to either get you to have hope for them or to despise them.
5,Downton Abbey,"This is a wonderful mini-series and worth the cost. It is well written, has good character development, an entertaining story, and beautiful costuming, as well as a gorgeous house setting. The extra features are very interesting, as well."
3,A Disappointing Package,"There's no doubt about the spell-binding effect of Downton Abbey, the fine collection of actors, the setting and the period costumes. What disappointed me was that in attempting to get both Season I. and Season II. on DVD's, we found it to be a mix of both seasons, with some episodes omitted. There was duplication in Season II. of some scenes from Season I.However, the series is seductive and compelling, even for American audiences. We are looking forward to Season III."
4,Shades of J. Arthur Rank,A reminder of the great British films and TV shows of the 1950s and 1960s. Great photography good script and most of all good acting. Can't wakt for season 3.
3,Very well done,"Except for 2 questionable scenes I would give this five stars. It was a bit difficult understanding some of the characters, being of British accent. It is very interesting and makes one want to watch the next episode."
5,Downton Abbey,.Reminds me of Pride and Prejudice. Enjoyed very much. I do not enjoy these surveys by the way. Okay?Stop
5,Great Series,Lives up to the hype! Enjoy how the story is basically told by the perspective of the servants. Very good.
5,Downton abbey,Easy to sign up and use! I loved watching it! Great customer service. Responsible priced for season. Thanks for the service.
4,Great show. Terrible sound quality.,"The show itself is excellent. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the DVD has sound issues. It was a constant pain to turn the volume up and down, as the speaking parts would alternate between really low and very loud. The music was unusually loud too. I use my computer to watch all my TV shows on DVD and have never had this problem with other DVD's before. I just got season 2 of Downton Abbey, and there is no issue with the DVD at all. I did see other reviews that had this problem as well, so there must be a bad batch out there somewhere, and unfortunately I got one."
5,Favorite all-time,"My wife and I were hooked after the first episode. Were always nearly unable to wait for next week's episode on PBS.Well written, with lovable (and some really unlikeable) characters.Look forward to Season 3."
5,Couldn't stop watching,"I watched this as a marathon & didn't stop until the last episode. I had already seen Season 2 & was just about to watch the last episode of Season 3, so now I am all caught up & can't wait to see more."
5,Wonderful show!,I love this show and I am so glad I could catch the episodes I missed on amazon! Each episode always leaves you wanting more!
5,Love Downdon Abby,"We are watching on Prime and can't get enough of this show.We are now watching season 2 and some nights we skip seeing the local news,because Downton Abby is more enjoyable."
5,Love it!,"Awesome series. Suspenseful, very engaging and addicting TV! Very unusual to see a TV series set in the 1920's. The series effectively reflects the transition of fashion and fads moving from the 19th century (horses and carriages to cars, long gowns to shortening hemlines) to the era of the flappers. Aside from fashion, affluence and intrigue the character portrayals and their interactions and relationships take center stage. We, the viewers, really care about them and what happens to them."
4,loved it,"Gripping,exiting, love the acting, well worth watching, good story line, can not wait to see the next season. Good time piece."
5,Season 1,This show is amazing! A great family series which captivates the entire audience. The writing has a natural appeal to women and men alike. The acting is superb; the conveyance of the actors is make to look effortless and the character development is flawless!
5,Downton Abbey Season 1,"This is a wonderful show; amazing cast and well-defined characters. An excellent and accurate portrayal of that time just before World War 1. This is a very strong cast, all playing their roles superbly - not a single weak link; must make special mention of Dame Maggie Smith who is always brilliant.I watched all of Season 1 during a day off, could not stop. Even then I did not want it to end; it was positively addictive. I rarely buy DVDs but decided this was one worth owning."
5,Dawnton Abbey season 1,"Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 1 [Blu-ray]Muy recomendable, la historia el lugar magnífica la ambientación , el vestuario y la carectarización de cada uno de los personajes. Lo llevan a uno a disfrutar cada uno de los capítulos de esta serie.El servicio de envío a mi pais extraordinario en tiempo y lo bien que llegan. A quien le gusten las series de época lo va a pasar muy bien"
5,Who doesn't love downton?,Having downton to watch whenever I want is awesome! And I love that amazing offered it before the last season was done airing in the us
5,"Captivating,",Well written and acted and believable. I enjoyed the look into British life on an earl's estate during the pre WW1 years and how the war changed everyone.
5,A Delight,This was one of the best DVD's I've had in a while. Was enraptured from start to finish. The end left you in the air a little but apparently the second series will take care of this.
5,Downton Abbey,"Masterpiece: Downton Abbey Season 1 - Excellent, enjoyed every minute of this season and also season 2 of Downton Abbey"
5,Best show in a time of trash tv!,"I love this show. Love the way it captures the time period, the setting, the issues of the time, the costumes, the set, the characters, everything! You will be hooked. I finished the whole season in just a couple weeks."
5,Thoroughly enjoyable,"An astute blend of history, costume drama, period piece, and literate soap opera. Plots and sub-plots are intriguing and the characters three-dimensional, complex and very well-played. Maggie Smith is a hoot as the Dowager Countess of Grantham, a role which could have been easily over-played. Joanne Froggatt is especially touching as Anna, and the motivations of Lady Edith, played by Laura Carmichael, arouse distaste and pity at the same time. Setting is lavish and striking and cinematography is superb."
4,Takes a lot of work to get into,"None of the actors and roles are identified, there are so very many characters, and yet, it draws one in. The story lines are fairly complicated and they don't introduce the characters well. That having been said, I'm sure I'm not the first to be interested in both the help and the bosses and how they have such nearly entirely different lives in the same house. Of course, it's harder for Americans to understand, but as our own wealthy class gets richer and the rest of us have an ever decreasing percentage of the wealth, it's not as hard as it may have been 20 or even 10 years ago.Of course, great acting. What an undertaking - so many personalities, so many nuances! Amazing!"
5,Most enjoyable,"I thoughly enjoyed this DVD and would highly recommend it to anyone. I hope they continue and make this truly a remarkable series. Buy it, it is a keeper."
5,Downtown Abbey,"Saw it on public television and not knowing what to expect I quickly became hungry for the following week's episode. Although it may not be representational of the real 1912-1914 era as some claim - I don't care! It was beautiful, full of twists and turns and provided considerably more intellegent entertainment than the usual drab and crude stuff that is normally found on the tube. I was surprised by the ending like others, and fairly unhappy, like others, until I learned that it is a series and that there would be more coming. How nice to have something to look forward to that is so well done. Bravo to the show and the excellent cast!"
2,Much ado about nothing,"I watched the first few episodes of Season One as this show was very highly rated and reviewed on Amazon. I was disappointed. The story is disappointing, basically a mountain made out of a molehill. Yes, the acting, direction, and production values are good. The production is a bit over the top (arguably) with attention to every minute piece of detail. However, it is the story which just doesn't grab me enough to make me want to watch any more. The show tries to lure viewers with fascinating trivia of early 20th century life in England, and I do not understand why viewers (the reviewers who rated this as 5 stars) are so caught up with it. Finally, I did not see a warning posted by anyone - this is a chick flick equivalent of a TV show. One of the rare occasions where ratings on Amazon are not justified."
2,"Lush setting, lame characters","When I found I could stream this series with my Amazon Prime trial, I was overjoyed. I'd heard so much about it.Yes, the setting is gorgeous, the clothing is beautiful, the women's faces are lovely and unlined (except Maggie Smith's, of course!), but...I just did not like any of the characters. After watching the first episode, I thought, ""Do I care about any of these people?"" And my answer was no, so that's it for me. No one seems nice at all, and some characters are downright annoying (Daisy). Maybe I'm just sick of the whole upper crust gotta-get-the-girl-married plot. (I've watched a lot of British movies.)"
5,I'm addicted to this series!,I rented this DVD from Redbox and that was it....I was hooked! Ordered this as a gift to send my parents who I know will enjoy it even more. What a wonderful historical look back to the early 1900's and the way society worked. This is better than any soap opera or reality show you could possibly watch. I'm counting the days until Season 3 starts. Incredible detail in every episode. Each hour was like a full blown movie. PBS has outdone itself!!
4,Wonderful,"What a wonderfully told story. The sets are beautiful. The cast is perfect. The acting is right on target. The story is interesting and engaging. The only downside is that it just abruptly stops. It didn't feel finished to me, and that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Fortunately I hear that the story is continuing and there should be more in late 2011. I really loved the characters and couldn't stop watching to see what would happen next. If you like slow British stories that give time to develop depth, plot and connection, this will be one of your favorites too."
5,Downton Abbey (UK edition),"This film was very well done, best I've seen in a long time. I will be buying more copies as gifts for Christmas this year."
4,not quite flawless,"The story quality was terrific;I am a huge Downton Abbey fan. There is a flaw in the DVD itself that makes it drag however and no way to return it after the package is open. Thinking it was my DVD player, I spent the extra money to and purchased a lens cleaner. Nothing worked. You can actually see the little spot on it."
5,Excellent !,"What a fabulous presentation. Excellent cast...excellent script...beautiful setting...perfect attention to details in scenery, sets and costuming. Very informative story line. You get to learn alot about English estates and their inhabitants...how they were run...how the relationships between the gentry and the help worked...and you are not given a ""perfect family"" to swallow. Quite a few undercurrents in this excellent presentation. I can't wait until ""Season 2"" is available!"
3,not sure,"I dont have cable, so ive been watching this on PBS. Full blown obsession!! love love love it!So i buy the dvd.....ill keep it short....the picture quality on mine is bad, grainy, and lines!!The lines drive me crazy!! its like 1000s of tiny lines when the camera or ppl move.Looked this up, seeing if i can find out why.soooo, RUMOR, its pbs or possibly a copy. If mine is, its a good job, as far as packaging andimage on dvd. but hey, if u can knock off a perfume or car..its not out of the question.Guess ill save my money and try the version thats not pbs next timeow and all DVD's are the UK version, dont be fooled!"
3,Audio Issues,Had to reorder this DVD after the first DVD had audio issues. Unfortunately the replacement DVD had the same audio issues. Amazon should recall this lot of DVDs.
5,Great series!,"i had heard so much about this series and had to watch from the beginning. well done! After the second episode, I am hooked!"
5,Loved it!,Loved the show and can't wait to see the rest of the seasons! I heard alot about the series and was glad I started watching.
5,"Bravo, Julian Fellows!","Beautifully done from EVERY aspect; acting, filming, writing, costumes, sound, sets, etc. Concerning those RARE moments of adult subject matter; none would warrant more than a PG13 rating. During this first season, the majority warrants a rating of PG only. Maggie Smith is BRILLIANT, and beyond entertaining, from start to finish. In creating and producing Downton Abbey, Julian Fellows has outdone himself, surpassing his former offering ""Godsford Park"". He skillfully weaves nineteen plus wonderfully rich character studies and entwining plot lines while creating a visually stunning piece of art. I purchased this series solely on the basis that Julian Fellows wrote and produced it. TOTALLY WORTH EVERY CENT! Absolutely love it! KEEP UP THE WONDERFUL WORK, JULIAN!!! BRAVO to all the cast and crew!"
5,Great episode of great series,This episode features Charlie Cox who played Owen on Boardwalk Empire. If you watch him in both shows you will get a lesson in why English actors are the best. The difference in the performances is tonal...and fascinating.And of course Downton Abbey is divine.
3,Wonderful story--but download not as expected,"When I decided to purchase Downton Abbey, i thought the purchase meant I could go to a public facility, download the movies to my computer, and take them home to view rather than stream it. My Verizon account is extremely slow and expensive if I use it to watch videos. Unfortunately, while I now ""own"" this, I still cannot watch even one session without using up the entire month's allotment of internet access--and yes, I do have the max monthly amount that Verizon allows before we pay extra by the minute. I do not have Kindle, nor do I want one. I wish the definition of ownership was stated upfront on Prime."
4,This is very well done!,My husband and I both really enjoyed this DVD series. It was so insightful into the servants' lives as well as the lives of the elite and wealthy.
5,LOVE THIS MOVIE,I can't tell you how many times I have seen this movie already. I can't wait for Season 2 to come out. The husband is HANDSOME !!! And everyone else is also beautiful !!!
5,Downton Abbey,"This show is beautifully written, well acted, and has magnificent photography. Best of all, I can watch it any time and/or place I wish on my iPad. Good system, Amazon."
1,WARNING,"Warning - only purchase if you like to watch grown men kiss. If you find it disturbing, then this is not for you. There are plenty of other great choices like Bleak House, North & South, etc."
3,When kids are watching you should know,"My 3 girls, 15 and under, and I enjoy these movies,ie. North and South, Pride and Prejudice etc.. However, in episode one, you should be aware that there is a love scene between 2 men. It's graphic, and I was horrified. I was able to protect my kids from seeing this, this time. There are other immoral adult scenes and themes, but not as explicit. Unlike other period pieces we have watched, there is no closure to any of the characters by the end of the movie. After watching so many hours, some tying up of loose ends would have been nice. This is written as a soap opera.We won't be buying the 2nd season since the reviews indicate that the story line becomes more unbelievable, and there still is no closure to the characters. Maybe season 3 will be better."
2,Lusty scenes and the worst in people,"I'm so disappointed to see movies that are beautifully filmed and acted with sex scenes and innuendos, especially when they are set in a somewhat more chaste time period. Beware that there is homosexual content if you find it offensive. It was sad to see the worst brought out in several characters, especially the hateful relationship of two sisters. Not as ruined as Northanger Abbey with it's nude scene (which would completely embarrass the author of the work), but still disappointing."
3,Imagination,"I share my period drama with my grandchildren who have learned to enjoy the same. Unfortunately, this production decided to put in a display of two men kissing. A suggestion would have been enough. I am turned off by today's films because they feel they have to display everything and leave nothing to imagination. Such a pity; what a waste. I do the right thing by watching the films first. ""Pride and Prejudice"" staring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is a fine example of sex and romance that is left to the imagination. That is the their favorite along with the ""Railroad Children."" I never have understood the film makers who believe they must expose all and express all in a vulgar manner and think that sells. I guess it does to some degree but does nothing for me. Otherwise ""Downton Abbey"" is splendid so far and I wish I felt I could share it to my grandchildren. Such a pity they chose to ruin it. I'm not overly conservative; however, I am protective of my grandchildren.Disappointed in PA"
1,Guys kissing,Turned it off as soon as two guys started kissing on screen. Disgusting. Good thing it was a free Amazon Prime video. Moving on.
1,Fine if you like to watch men kissing men,"The story was interesting and engaging, but I stopped watching when they portrayed a man kissing another man romantically. Not my cup of tea. If you like that sort of thing, this will likely be a good choice for you. If you don't like that sort of thing, be prepared for a surprise ""yuck"" factor."
1,Beware of the homosexual content,"As a frequent viewer of Masterpiece Theatre's films and series I was quiet surprised when they choose to include homosexual content in the very first episode of this series. I have always held their shows in high regard for their high moral and ethical standards, but have been proven wrong with this production. I presumed that their programs were family safe, but will now have my guard up when considering to view any of their productions. I am very dissapointed with Downtown Abbey and hope that Masterpiece Theatre will do a better job making their films appropriate for children and families. Don't let appearences fool you, the depravity of the world is now being glamorized by Masterpiece!"
1,Not a family movie,"This was really well done from an artistic stand point, that is, right up until a footman kisses a duke in his room in a very seductive scene. Not a family friendly video, by any means. Very disappointed."
1,generous with one star,a SNOOZER! how can anyone enjoy this! this show is awful! 4 stars really? must be the actors moms and dads giving those stars
1,Don't watch if you don't want to see a gay couple making out,"Well this was an enjoyable movie, the 1st episode ends with two guys kissing. Ruins the movie! I was very disappointed and wish I had read more reviews before wasting an hour of my time."
5,Downton Abbey Season 1,I just learned about Downton Abbey and watched Season 1 and 2 and the current season in about a weeks time period. I could not stop watching it. I love the characters. It was like I was there and got to know all the people. I would recommend it to anyone.
5,don't miss this!,"caution: once you get started, you'll be hooked and waiting for the next episode whether it's next sunday or next season. this is a keeper."
5,best show ever,"really love this show,have a hard time getting this in my area,was very happy to be a prime customer.glad i belong to Amazon"
5,Great Series & Good Offer through Amazon Prime,"This is a wonderful show and series. It's got great story lines, interesting plot twists, and to some degree, suspense! And, it has great acting throughout. I'm very glad that the previous seasons are 'free' with the Amazon Prime membership."
5,Downton Abbey Season 1 through 4,Masterpiece: Downton Abbey Season 1 through Season 4One of the best PBS masterpiece production I have seen.The costumes were beautiful and authentic. Their home was just as it should have been
5,Downton Abbey Season 1,"If I had know ahead of time or heard about this series I would have watched it on TV.I absolutely loved the first season and that is why I also purchased Season 2.The acting is superb, the costumes are marvelous and the house is wonderful.I love this show."
5,RU U Kidding?,"This is a fabulous production and since we missed some of this season, we bought this and watched it. Cant say too much good about this. It frames history and a bygone era in the most entertaining and informative way. Get all the seasons."
5,I am addicted,I enjoy the interaction of all the characters. It's impressive to me how kind the family is to the servants. It's like 2 families in the same house because it seems like the servants are a family although not related. I am addicted to the series. Can't wait to see what happens next.
5,Great Series,I enjoyed the acting and the story so much I bought all 3 seasons!Well balanced character development of both the Wealthy Landowners and their extensive staff.excellent!
5,Great!,The dvd set came exactly when they said it would. I was glad it did not take longer because my mom and I were very anxious to watch it. Thank you!
2,The Region A Blu-ray is defective -- buy at your own risk,"Unfortunately, the Region A Blu-ray version of Downton Abbey Season 1 (Original UK Version) is defective. The video was apparently transferred incorrectly from PAL 1080i 25 fps to ATSC 1080i 30 fps. It stutters noticeably every few seconds to the point of being very distracting no matter which Blu-ray player, TV, or video processor I used to deinterlace/play it. I recommend buying the Region B version and playing it on a region-free player and TV that can handle PAL 1080i 25 fps formats without conversion to 30 fps. Unfortunately, Whatever post-production company PBS contracted with did a terrible job of converting this to region A formats, which is a shame because it is such a great series. The only reason this gets two stars is that the series is so good."
4,Abbey,"Good period piece, lovely costumes and sets. Enjoyable storyline, were leaning towards more interest in the maids n butlers than the family they serve, maybe that is the intention?"
5,Well Done!,"This is a wonderful series. The acting is superb with beautifully appointed scenes. Each episode give the viewer at taste for even more. The story line and sub-story lines are interesting, with a touch of history. The viewer has an opportunity to see the intricate details of running a manner with the complications of a new era coming; woman's rights, the decline of nobility, the onset of the industrial boom and WWI. I would recommend this series to anyone interested in a well scripted series. I, personally, can't wait to purchase Season 2."
5,The Best Ever,"Me and several friends are consumed by Downton Abbey. I've seen the third season first and looking forward to finishing this season 1, then two."
5,Love this series!,This is a great series. Love all the actors and the story line is great.Great drama and the undercurrent of comedy.
5,A wonderful production.,"One of the best movie productions ever. Costumes are beautiful. Cast and scenery are great. I have now watched Seasons 1, 2, and 3 and am looking forward to Season 4."
4,Not Unedited,"I do like this dvd because I love the show; but the so-called ""unedited"" dvd is not really ""unedited."" There are a number of scenes that have been cut short. I realized this when I watched the re-broadcast of the show on television. That was very annoying."
5,addictive,"This keeps your mind on the go keeping up with all that's going on. I really got ""hooked"" after a couple shows."
5,Downtown Abby,I really like this English series. I am watching the second season on TV but plan to buy it also.
5,soap opera in period costume,"This is a fascinating visit into a wealthy home and family in England from the sinking of the Lusitania though the war, following the gentry and the servants through their travails and their lives and all the plotting. The characters have depth. All are acted well. Sort of question the casting for Bates, one of the lead characters, who physically seems too ponderous for the role. Great costuming."
3,Best Thing on TV.............,"...........but that is not saying a lot given what passes for prime time programs these days. I found the writing sloppy with too many hand of God interventions that are generally the result of some sort of writer's block. Is it it lousy? No. Is it original? No....Mrs Miniver's screenplay should have least been formally credited, and these kinds of people were described so much better by Galworthy, Ford Maddox Ford, and Evelyn Waugh.Is it habit forming................yes, it is great soap opera...............and there is nothing wrong with that. Season 2 is in the post!"
3,Just So So,"I liked the show, but I viewed in online, and the quality wasn't good. I kept getting interrupted to ""buffer"". It was very annoying."
5,love it!!!!,I'm so addicted to this show i can't wait to see season 2 and 3 everyone should watch it!!!! enjoy
2,tune in again next year (if you want the ending),"very captivatingreally surprised when I saw that there was no ending--just dangling unresolved plot lineswaiting for next seasonfelt annoyed and cheated,don't bother buying until the rest of the story is written (if it is ever actually produced)"
2,Lowering of the bar,"Nicely filmed. Poorly acted. Poorly cast. Poorly written. This is a story which takes a proud genre, the British period piece, and makes it just pedestrian enough, and just inane enough to appeal to the modern mass market, even in America. It has all of the salaciousness and sliminess of a modern soap opera and little else to mitigate this unfortunate nature, other than the nice interior home shots and posh British accents. The bar has been lowered to meet the modern taste as is so often the case in modern media."
2,Disappointed!,"Disappointed!Downtown Abbey is an absorbing story, and a wonderful commentary on the society then prevailing in England. My disappointment stemmed from the fact that I received only three disks, an incomplete version. I watched more episodes on PBS CPTV, and it was precisely because the series ended before denouement, that I ordered the DVD. Alas, the three disks of my newly received DVD titillatingly stopped MIDWAY! How disappointed I was, for nowhere in the advertisement did it say that the three disks told only half the story. That pronouncement should have been have been prominently displayed! Then one would not be left moaning, ""What, oh what ever happened to Downtown Abbey? Perhaps it was bombed to smithereens!"""
2,Disappointing,"Thought it would be the quality of Pride and Prejudice or Becoming Jane but it lacks in both visual and auditory quality. It was more like watching a made-for-TV soap opera. I found it very hard to understand what they were saying at times,even though I lived in England three years!It was described as very lush in visuals and I didn't find that at all.The costumes were good and the interior of the home was nicely done but I felt it lacked breadth and depth and the feel of a quality film set."
1,*boring*,"I love English/BBC productions, but maybe I was not in the mood for Downtown Abbey.I purchased one episode and that was it. I had a hard time following and didn't care for the gay situation at all."
1,Gay Kissing Scene,"Not everyone wants to witness homosexual kissing. It's really too bad that the makers of this story felt the need to do that. Warning to those who, like me, do not want to watch nor support that kind of movie."
1,R-rated scenes,I ordered this DVD because I love period films but I was not prepared for the homosexual scenes (two men making love). It was extremely offensive and I did not finish watching the DVD.
1,Great potential but disappointingly not family-friendly,"Being an avid fan and buyer of period films old and new, I was greatly looking forward to this production. Such fabulous actors, scenery, costumes, and more. However (SPOILER) the graphic portrayal of a same-sex relationship in the first episode makes it definitely not suitable for our family's entertainment preferences. Really a shame."
1,Not acceptable,"We were really interested in and enjoying this show with our whole family until a very seedy and needless scene of two men who began kissing on a bed and speaking of their previous encounters.One of the men had just led one of the main characters, a young lady off alone to some secluded parts of their mansion and it was assumed that he was interested in her in a romantic way. The point I would like to make is that we felt that we had been subjected to seeing sexual imagery that we would rather have not seen and it was upsetting for us all. The film seemed to be well-made and intriguing but it is a shame that the producers felt they needed to include such topics to attract attention to their movie. Badly done...badly done indeed. What a disappointment! Please keep this type of historic drama family friendly as there is much to be learned from them."
1,Find men kissing men nauseating,I wish there were some way to know that these kinds of things are in the shows...I was just getting into the plots when I just was sickened! I don't like those kind of surprises...want to be able to pick what kinds of entertainment I like ahead of time.
4,Very Entertaining,"I love Downton Abbey... I can watch three shows back to back and not get bored! I've watched Season 1 twice and have just started Season 2 and it's even better already! Great characters, compelling story line!"
5,Downton Abbey Season 1,"After reading and hearing all the hype about Downton Abbey from my friends, I just had to see what it was all about. Well, I am hooked. I watched Season 1 and 2 in one weekend. Now on to Season 3."
5,The Best,This is a fabulous series. I am addicted and so are my friends. Please make season 3 available to amazon prime subscribers.
5,New Favorite Series,Many of my friends have talked about this series and couldn't wait for Season 3 to start. I wanted to see all of the episodes leading up to Season 3. Not disappointed. Excellent historical fiction series.
4,Great show,I am finally getting to view this great series. Sorry I waited so long. Love the costuming and period effects
5,"Best New to us show,",So much is covered in one episode. The acting is wonderful . The characters are well developed. Both my husband and I love it - it has become our favorite show!
5,BEST SHOW ON TV IN A LONG TIME!,"This is one of the best shows I've seen on TV in a long time. I was hooked right from the start! I love the period in history when the story takes place and it is interesting to see how aristrocrats lived in those days. The story line is interesting and has lots of twists & turns. I loved it so much, I watched almost all of season one in one day, and I only have 2 episodes of season two left to go! I highly recommend Downton Abbey!"
5,Awesome,I'm hooked... Great show! Have gone through season 1 and season 2... just caught up on season 3.It's a definite Watcher!
5,Very British soap opera,This series is just plain fun to watch. The acting is great and I'm spending far too much time with it.
5,LOVE IT!,I started watching season 3 and became totally addicted to the show. I purchased all three seasons and started over at season 1.
5,Downton Abbey,"Downtown Abbey. It is polished and sophisticated. The program was excellent, however your system crashes often. This crashing occurs with almost if not all of your programs and is severe enough for me to consider not using your service."
5,Worth owning,"We now watch over and over again for the nuance we missed the last time. Foreshadowing. Poignant pieces of dialogue that lend further insight into the character and events yet to be known. Beautifully photographed, each time we stop, it's a painting. We manage to get in a good bit of conversation about history and character, because now we have the option of taking it in slowly to digest the complexities. It holds up wonderfully to deeper exploration. What writing! How refreshing to have well written, well directed, well acted material. God Bless the British."
4,Worth the money and considerably better than most TV programs..,"Do not normally buy movie DVD's and certainly do not normally watch these types of shows but, at the advice of a relative, decided to give this a try. My wife and I really enjoyed the episodes and are looking forward to season two. Probably in the top 10% of all TV programs we have watched. The DVD's are relatively inexpensive given the cost is less than the price of two movie tickets."
5,triple thumbs up,"I found it to be absolutely brilliant!!!very lush, wonderful production value, compelling characters set in a fascinating time period."
4,Good show and great time filler,Entertaining and true to life but then your realized that an hour episode could be summed up in a few minutes...
4,very enjoyable,I watched the first episode and found it very interesting & enjoyable. I'm looking forward to watching the rest of the episodes.
5,addictive!,"Love love this ""masterpiece"". Highly addictive and worth every minute of time becoming absorbed in all the wonderful characters! Amazing actors throughout!"
5,Wonderful!,"Sorry I waited so long to watch it, but so glad to have found this treasure now. Was sick last weekend and watched the entire season in one day. On to the second season now."
5,Entertainment value,The program is delightful and entertaining and put a smile on my face. A successful period piece that clearly reveals the progress of society we have made.
5,"Great show, I was not disappointed.","Everything about this show fits, from the cinematography, to the casting, to the music. The story lines are well thought out. Brilliantly done."
4,great show,"great acting and storyline hope it stays that way and more will be produced, I just discovered this show in Jan."
5,Outstanding!,"This whole series is simply some of the best viewing available from anyone for the home screen. Period. After discovering D.A. at the end of Season 2, my wife and I are hooked. When I found this on Prime we went back to the very beginning to get all of the storyline, and we are glad we did. I hope this series goes on and on!"
4,Entertaining and British,We watched the first season in one week. It is entertaining and keeps you guessing and Maggie Smith is always awesome.
5,Gets you hooked right away,"Am enjoying following all the action and drama on Downton Abbey, missed the first season so was very happy to find it on Amazon. Saw a special on HGTV about castles and they showed this castle and the owners, it was very interesting to see where they film and how they film."
5,Great Show,Very interesting and well done episodes. Wonderful acting by everyone. If you like soaps this will be well worth your time. I enjoyed it immensely.
5,Recommend,"I have purchased several series over the years, both fictional and non fictional, with some serious disappointments. However this one is in my top five, the storey is engaging, it has a cohesive flow and a reality about it. The challange is to only watch a chapter per sitting and to save a little for the next day. Definitely five stars."
5,This is perfect!!!,If you love historical fiction this is for you. Definitely would recommend! Very entertaining! Never a dull moment. Many story lines to get wrapped up in.
3,Playback in HD,Playback in HD thru the net on my TV was steppy. Would be better to have purchased in SD. Love the show tho
1,Can't watch on your television.,Be aware that if you purchase this for download to your ipad or iphone that you will not be able to watch it on your television due to software blocks. You must purchase in itunes inorder to stream to your television.
1,No cc,I cannot watch anything without cc closed captioning. Therefore I only will use Netflix or other which feature closed captioning.
1,Guess i need to watch more?,I know a lot of people watch this show. I found the first episode to be very slow. (as did my fiance). I guess I need to watch more?
5,Beautifully entertaining,It's been a long time since I have thoroughly enjoyed a T.V. series. Always enjoy that Dame Maggie Smith. The characters have a similar romantic air that Jane Autin would be proud. Love this idealistic family striving to hold on to values and traditions yet allowing the next generation to abound in the changing world around them. Could Lord G. really have been so open minded? Can't wait for Matthew and Mary to finally confess their ardor for one another and to see Mrs. O'brien & Thomas get theirs. Bates and Anna are kindred spirits and just love them.Thank you Masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Addictive like a good book that you cannot put down,I had heard that the Season 3 Downton Abbey has become the number one recorded show and it sparked my interest. But I wanted to see it from the beginning. Thank You Amazon for having season 1 on Instant Video. Free with Prime. I was hooked from the first episode. Excellent !!!
2,Poor download,"I love this tv show, what was disappointing was the instant download or streaming never happened with my iPad. If it were a true instant stream video, I would have been satisfied!"
1,Awful.,"One reviewer said it best- ""watching rich people behave badly in period costumes"" only they meant it in a good way. This series has it all- innuendo and blatant NON innuendo. How can people watch this garbage? (Or, as the Brits would say, rubbish) let ALONE let their kids watch this?"
3,How to get unabridge version?,"The PBS Masterpiece version isn't a complete version of this series. The run time is close to 6 hours, but the original is about 8 hours. An article about this appeared in Telegraph. [...]. It was changed for us American viewers. Anyway, I'd like the unabridged version. Does anyone know where to get the original version that ran on ITV but in a U.S. DVD format?"
1,DEFECTIVE PRODUCT!,"It's bad enough that Movie Emporium, through Amazon of course, is selling defective merchandise but now I see that I have to wait for them to ""approve "" my returning it. Lousy treatment by Amazon and Movie Emporium. Disc 1 won't even load into my Blu-ray player while the second disc does. Didn't really see much difference in this ""uncut"" version anyway. Very disappointed in Amazon and this seller."
1,Not happy!,"Bought this DVD set with the understanding that it was for the entire first season of Downton Abby. It is not! It was only the disc with episodes six and seven of the first season. The disc cover clearly says: ""one of three discs"". I am not happy at all with this merchant. The item discription was clearly wrong...or someone owes me two more discs of season one!"
1,Awful,"Heard so many good things about this series, I decided to get it. Watched the first hour, turned it off, realizing I had just wasted an hour of my time.Horrible acting; mumbled dialogue; two men kissing in the midst of a storyline that had NOTHING to do with their behavior. Just plain awful.Don't waste your time."
1,disc problems and version differences,"One star for the DISC experience. Five stars for the show. One of my favorite shows, I ordered this blu ray version of DOWNTON ABBEY, but was surprised to get a 2-disc set (the description says 3-disc set) where one disc had no sound. I've returned the discs back to Amazon, but may consider getting a DVD set instead. Anyone else order this version (3-disc described) and ended up with a 2-disc set?"
1,Two Men Kissing Ended All My Interest In This Series!,"I don't give a hoot about *Political Correctness*! I refuse to watch homosexual scenes! All I have to say about it,for those who feel the same BEWARE!I'm sure I will now be *FLAMED* by all the HETEROPHOBES!"
5,Downton Abbey,"Finally, something on television worth watching. Amazing! Writing, acting, plot, costuming can't be beat! I look forward to each new episode now that I am all caught up!"
5,The Best Show on Television!,"I will keep this review short and sweet. ""Downton Abbey"" is simply - hands down - the best show on television at the moment!"
5,Masterpiece of entertainment,"I just watched both seasons of Downton Abby, and was very moved by the creativity, history, and the human spirit it so elegantly presented. It is rare for me to rate a television show this highly; I hope everyone will enjoy this story as much as I have."
4,This is a period piece I will watch,"I am not a fan of the movies from this time period so it took me a while to check out Downton Abbey. I started watching the first episode and was hooked by the end. I love the turmoil upstairs and down. By the end of the first episode, I already hated some of the characters because you can see they are the backstabbing type.The acting is great and the character development is good so far. I like how some episodes bring up stuff from previous ones.I am trying to see which class I would have wanted to be in. While upstairs has it's privileges, downstairs would be more rewarding to me."
4,"what a soap, but nobody does it better...","...than the brits for this sort of thing. worth it just for the stunning cinematography, location, and near-perfect art direction. yes, the dialogue and social depiction suffers slightly from anachronistic polyannaism: probably the upstairs folk not really that tolelrant, nor the downstairs ever so dastardly in their day. but the major fault is that the plot is just laboriously so very soap-opera-ish. rolled my eyes a lot. look to fellows' MONARCH OF THE GLEN for a similar effect: started strong, then got silly towards the end. honestly, disappointed the first season 6 hours didn't offer a conclusion; it would probably have made for much better writing choices. still, all in all a gorgeously entertaining piece."
5,I LOVED IT!!!!,This is the best movie/series i've seen in a long time. The characters are well developed and the story very intriguing. I would definitely recommend.
2,Download failed,"I purchased season 1; episode 5 did not download. After two calls to Amazon, I discovered this was a ""known issue"". But they still let me buy it.In the end they canceled my purchase and issued a refund, so they always play straight at the end!"
3,We were supposed to be repelled,"I think the point of showing the 2 men kissing was to cast the man about to seduce a woman in a bad light: showing him as a scoundrel. He was true to no one. And to show the duplicity and hypocrisy of someone who had such appealing packaging whom everyone was raving about, i.e., that ""things aren't always as they seem"". It was an extremely effective way to show his true character. The point of the kiss was to show one individual's true nature, not to condone or condemn homosexuality.I don't care for the series, however, for other reasons. It is well done and realistic: I just find it too depressing. True, life is depressing. But I wish to see the best in people, something to aspire to. I enjoy period shows such as Lark Rise to Candleford (a wonderful blend of realism and optimism), Pride & Prejudice, Sense & Sensibility."
5,Downton Abby,It was very good and riviting entertainment. I look forward to the next season with anticipation. I only wish that each season had more sessions.
5,PBS brought me to a new level on BBC Loving...,"Not only is the series well done and always leaving me wanting more, but the companion book helps tide me over till next season...Hurry Up! Buy it on BLU Ray. It does need more extras..."
4,Downton Abbey,"I can't help but compare this new ""classic"" with Upstairs/Downstairs, the old ""classic"". The first episode is a bit overwhelming in that many characters are introduced in a short period of time and one can be a bit confused initially. However, from the start you realize this Masterpiece Series will be very interesting from a human relations standpoint. I believe it will show how complex ""families"" can be, and how a household, like Downton Abbey, is one family. It also shows how the ""family"" is a living, breathing organism that has many interdependent relationships. It is a fascinating view of lives most of us will never experience or understand completely."
5,Top notch show,Absolutely the best show on tv right now. Superb writing and character development. I am hooked and I am getting my friend and family hooked too.
4,Nobody does it better than the British,"I became aware of this wonderful ITV series while reading a message board about Larkrise to Candleford (another great series, highly recommended). I've just viewed it on youtube thank you british folks! After I watched it, it occurred to me that it was somewhat like ""Upstairs Downstairs"" in that you saw the workings ""above the stairs"" and was as down. The difference is that it is set in a magnificent country mansion (or seat, whatever, I'm not british).It's set in the early 1900s. The costumes and settings are superb.I did feel the earl was a little to egalitarian concerned about the downstairs staff, just too ""nice"". From the series 1901 house, on pbs, the servants/staff were to be as out of view as possible.Highly recommended."
4,Addictive,I grew up without cable and with PBS and I love to see people really get into masterpiece theater! Maggie Smith is perfection and the story is addictive! I saw both seasons in one day and I cannot wait to see season three!
5,Downton Abbey is a Masterpiece,"I was immediately hooked! This series is so well done. The story line is great, the acting is great, I don't have anything negative to say about it. I usually go to bed around 10:00 to 11:00, but was up until 1:00 and 2:00 a.m. watching numerous episodes until I knew I had to go to bed or my work would suffer. I watched season 1 and 2 in about a week and that is record TV watching for me! LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!!! Have not talked to a single person who doesn't LOVE this show!"
5,Wife loves it,Wife loves the show. Especially based on the time period they are capturing. The drama is revealed through lots of characters which gives the show plenty of ability to throw in a twist. Likely will not disappoint.
5,Downton Abbey,Love anything British. Also loved the music. Especially enjoyed actors in the drama.Downton Abbey was one of the better series. Could hardly wait for each episode.
4,Families are complex and simple ....finding how you fit in is always a challenge.,"I liked the interactions of the staff, servants. of relationships made and broken... but mostly about a time that helped to shape futures beyond everyones imaginations.......on a personal note I ordered the whole series...todate it has NOT been sent....would appreciate any assistance I can get to expedite shipping...thanks Jeanne Gegenheimer"
5,Downton Abbey,Loved the acting. Will probably get the rest of the series. It was worth the purchase. I would encourage you to watch it if you like movies from the olden times.
5,Amazing!!!!!,"This is an amazing show - i never watch TV and I loved it. I never review anything and I just had to review this one! It is so good, so beautiful (scenery, costumes), and the best story line - I have only watched one episode and I am completely hooked!!!!"
4,Characters you want to get to know,Each has their back story and you want to know who they are. A well developed soap opera with historical impact. A look into the world of the privileged world of the aristocracy.
5,WONDERFUL,"For fans of shows with beautiful cinematography, lots of characters, intriguing plots, and beautiful costumes, you'll love Downton Abbey. I can't wait for Season 3!"
5,pbs - hits the ball out of the park,PBS - hits the ball out of the parkFully developed characters with enough personages to fill-out a true-to-life series.
5,Excellent series,We have thoroughly enjoyed this historical series about Edwardian England and given the series as a gift to friends and family. Highly recommended.
5,Downton Abbey Season 1,"I first became aware of and interested in ""Downton Abbey"" after seeing a segment on CBS News Sunday Morning about it. Since then my daughter and I have been watching them here on Amazon. We love the show and can hardly wait to get all caught up to the current season. The show is so well done, and the cast is superb. The characters are multifaceted and complex, not at all shallow. The costuming is excellently done as is the musical score for the show. All in all, I have only good things to say about the show. It's definitely worth your time watching. Love the show!"
5,Downton Abbey,"Very well done. I liked the costumes, the old cars, the scenery, and the acting. Looking forward to seeing more of the same."
5,great storyline,I love reading or watching movies about this time period. Downton Abbey has done a wonderful job at capturing the time and romance of this time. I had to see the first season and now I will watch the second season so I will be caught up. It's very addicting and I can't wait to watch more.
5,Late comer,My sister kept talking about the series but I wasn't motivated to watch until a surgery left me with two weeks to kill. I watched season 1 in two days. Captivating character development and terrific detail of period specifics I am now a huge fan of Downton.
5,Great Show,Am streaming this show and on the second season. I am really enjoying it! Would recommend to all to watch.
5,Can't Resist watching!,My husband and I were looking for a new series to jump into. I heard this series had a growing fan base and decided to see what it was all about. My husband loves it as much as I and is starting to talk wth a british accent :)
5,Now I know what all the fuss is about,"I heard and read so much about this series which I'd never viewed on PBS. I ordered this video as well as Season II video and immensely enjoyed both. I love ""period"" pieces, doomed love stories, scandal, etc. Downton Abbey has it all! The acting is magnificent, photography and direction superb. It was a struggle not to watch all episodes in one sitting! Can't wait for Season III."
5,Downton Abbey,"This series is fascinating to me. After watching it on TV, I felt I needed to have the DVD to visit the chacacters again (and again). They just pull you in; the acting is wonderful and Maggie Smith a joy; the costumes are fabulous and the upstairs/downstairs plot lines are so believable. Anything from Masterpiece Theater is so good but, for me, the series is great."
5,Great Show!,So excited to be able to stream this! Great show and the video quality is really good! Will def use prime to view more shows!
5,great story - superb acting,The setting is luxurious and the conversations are interesting and many cause smiles and some laughter to erupt. Maggie Smith is wonderful!
5,Great stories and great actors,"Loved every minute. Would watch again! These actors are so well suited for their parts. They truly bring this family and its' household to life. Makes me (well, for maybe a hot minute) wish I had lived in this time."
5,Love this show!,I have enjoyed this series so much and being able to view it on my phone just about anywhere has been fantastic.
4,Downton Abbey,"A good show. Well done. Acting, costumes and scenery good in Downton Abbey.It is interesting to study this time of our history."
4,Missing Disc,"Loved the show, but the 3 disc package came with number 3 missing. I gave this as a gift that was received after the allowed return date."
5,Wonderfully entertaining,"I love this series so much, the characters, the clothes, the manor, etc. I watched the entire season 1 straight through and was disappointed when I finished the last episode. I just wanted it to go on and on."
5,Downton Abbey Season 1,Outstanding series - warm family feeling and captivating story lines. Like a great novel that you can't put down - enjoy
5,Excellent,Loved every bit of it and have now ordered the other seasons of Downton AbbeyWill watch it more than once.....so many details to pick up on.
5,Love it!,It sucked me in immediately! I wish the season were longer. I love being taken back in time to see how life was then.
5,Truly a masterpiece,"This series is absolutely fantastic. I was hooked after the 1st episode. Maggie Smith is great as the dowager countess, her sarcasm always spot on."
3,Mildly interesting,I watch when I have nothing else to do. I don't think I can add eleven more words for the reveiw
5,Great series,"I watched this at the recommendation of a friend. Great story, great acting. Love it! Can't wait to watch all of the seasons."
5,"Fantastic,Fantastic,Fantastic","This is an amazing series. Superb acting,magnificent scenery, and a storyline that pulls you in and makes it difficult to stop watching."
5,Downton Abbey,Can you tell me if these series has subtitles in spanish?Downton Abbey: Complete Seasons 1 & 2 (6 Discs)
5,A world gone bye,"Downtown Abbey shows us a world long gone, and perhaps also the reasons for it. Set in the beautiful Hiclere Castle, perhaps a character in itself, the series is beautifully acted, and it is difficult to say which of the ensemble says most with a widening or narrowing of the eye, or rise of the shoulder. Dame Maggie must take the prize, but the others learn from her.Don't miss this wonderful collection, a must for Anglophiles and students of the period."
5,Love this series,"This is an amazing series! When I first started watching it, I wasn't quite sure how I felt about it. Now that I've watched both seasons that have been released in the US, its amazing. I can't stop watching it! I will say its hard to multitask with such an intense show on, but that's not a bad thing."
5,Again excellent,"The stories continue with history added into the story lines, Again the acting is great and story line intertwined and am wating for the seasom three. would recommed this to anyone. I was not a great lover of Upstairs Downstairs."
5,Downtown Abbey,"Very believable characters and settings and events. I became involved with the storyline and immediately ordered Season 2. I can't wait for the start of Season 3. Acting is superb, costumes are delightful Downton is a character in its own right. Loved it!"
5,Excellent,"Excellent show. It's dramatic and at the same time has a soft story line. It the heart of hard times, there is love."
5,Awesome viewing!,Would highly recommend this to anyone! It's fun and yet also educational. Can't wait for Season 3 to come out!
5,I love it and it came fast!,I love this show! It shipped fast and I watched it all in two days. It's great if you love the time period.
2,"Love it, however.....................","Just watched season one and loved it, apart from one point. The whole story line about the ""Flower Show!"". So obviously taken from ""Mrs Miniver"", one of my favorites. Whoever was responsible didn't need to 'steal' that. SHAME! on you."
5,Just watch it,Make sure you set aside some time. Get a babysitter for the kids - preferably out of the house - so you have time to catch up on past seasons. You'll be hooked after the first episode.
2,not as good as i thought it would be,After all the hype it was very disappointing never even finished the first episode. Great cast members but lacked something. It actually bored me
2,Disappointed,The Blue Ray disc started with episode 4 instead of starting with episode 1 which was disappointing and confusing. It was lucky we had already watched the series and knew in what order the episodes were. This was the first time I have ordered a Blue Ray from Amazon and will be my last.
3,Faulty merchandise,"Two of the three disks had glitches in them, places where the screen just froze.As this was supposed to be a new product, I was pretty annoyed at this."
1,Not filmed in HD so lots of Blur!!,"Season 1 is not filmed in HD, so there is a lot of motion blur. It's hard to watch at times. You're better off buying the regular DVD...which is what I'm about to do."
1,Don't bother ruining the Downton experience with this crud,"I am a huge Downton fan. I have been streaming the Prime free amazon video of Season 1. So I bought PBS blu ray Season 2 and watched the free streaming. It is not edited or cut like the show was on PBS. So I break down after trying to read 584 reviews and decide to get Season 1 PBS on blu ray. What garbage! Judder, ghosting, people racing across screen. Herby jerky movement and colors so awful I think the non HD DVD would be better. Worst blu ray quality I have ever experienced, it is unwatchable. I will continue streaming ( on my third round of watching both seasons) and return this. Upon further review seems you can order all of Downton as region free blu rays from amazon.uk including the Christmas special for less than $45. So that's what I am trying next."
5,I love it,Its the best series ever and I would recommend it to anyone who may like a small international film its the best
5,Absolutely Positiviely Brilliant!,"OK. I just finished watching episode 1. It is utterly wonderfully astonishingly amazingly GOOD (I left out those commas on purpose, consider it a bit of stream-of-conscious going on here!). It is grand. Perfect. Riveting, galvanizing, and swift. I just can't think of any more superlative adjectives right now.I so want to watch the next episode but am going to wait and give myself time, first, to enjoy my delight over this one. I can only advise to anyone who reads this: my friend, watch this! Revel in the elegant play of words, the harsh ripostes, the unsubtle accusations, the coy bon-mots! Let your jaw fall looking at this grande dame of a house, and marvel at the wonderful cast (Maggie Smith is awesome, but guess what? So is everyone else!!). Watch. Be enchanted, surprised, heart-broken, uplifted, astonished. Gratified."
5,Enjoyable Victorian Drama,"I love Masterpiece and their offerings. Downton Abbey is no different. If you have seen and enjoyed Upstairs, Downstairs, Jane Austen collection and other BBC dramas, you will love Downton Abbey. A superlative ensemble cast including thespian actor, Hugh Bonneville playing the Earl of Grantham, master of Downton Abbey, Maggie Smith as the Countess of Grantham, Dan Stevens (of Sense and Sensibility fame) playing the heir presumptive to Grantham and Penelope Wilton as Mrs. Crawley is sure to keep you entertained.The acting is top notch, writing, superior and the execution, flawless. See it for the sets, drama, comedic sequences between the Countess and Mrs. Crawley, and the whole underlying issue of English laws prohibiting women from inheritances.If you are an anglophile, you don't want to miss it."
5,Downton Abbey Rewiew,"Both seasons of Downton Abbey combine the best of acting skill, a great story line and meticulous attention to detail to costume, historical fact,and location to make a true Masterpiece. From the first episode to the last your attention will never wane. Bravo!!!"
5,"""Masterpiece"" Downton Abbey. Season 1 I was hooked and never aching for more","Masterpiece"" Downton Abbey. Season 1 I was hooked and never aching for more. The characters brought you in and you feel this has to be real. The clothes the setting, the lights the word usage...everything about Downton is authentic. You will love season 1 & 2. Enjoy"
4,"A wonderful, guilty pleasure","The plots might be a little hysterical, but the acting is fine and the design is great. Can't wait for the third season. The instant video interface could be easier."
5,Highly addictive and very satisfying!,"If you love period drama, then this is the show for you. It is definitely addictive and the characters develop as the season goes on. Season 1 sets the background and drama for Season 2 which is oh so good. It is hard not to feel for some of the Downton residents while loathing others. A great escape!"
5,Can't wait for entire 3rd Season on Prime.,Love this MiniSeries. The acting is perfect. Drama is addicting. This was recommended by friend. I'm sure glad she did.
2,not my thing,"the quality of the product is perfect, the use of amazon prime is awesome, I just don't like the show much. I don't like mean people that hold ill will against others, even if it is only fiction. I will try to watch a bit more, but for the most part, don't like it."
4,Downton Abbey Season 1,"... very elegantly produced - need to listen closely to work through British accents - pretty good character development - plot has potential to get a bit ""soapy"" ..."
5,"Well, duh!","How could you not love it? Perfection! Mindless, fun, eye candy at its best with accurate historic reference. Best soap since Jane Austen!"
5,Entertaining and heartfelt,"I enjoyed both seasons of this series. It is one of the best ones currently on TV. So many other series now seem vapid, unimportant, poorly acted, etc. I hope there will be another season!"
5,awesome,"I absolutely love this show, loved being able to download and watch it on my computer. Awesome to be able to do this"
5,great!,I thoroughly enjoyed this series and immediately bought the next season. I like that i can watch them again whenever i want. Can't wait for season 3
5,Downton Abbey,I loved every minute of it. It couldn't be better. I especially liked the idea that it was the UK edition.
5,Wonderful history lessons,I have enjoyed Downton Abbey very much. I learned a lot of history that I missed in school and have continued to resd other books about that era. I've found that the shows give a pretty accurate story and I love Maggie Smith's character.
5,One of the best drama series I have ever seen!,"Normally, I do not get hooked into television series. I rarely watch tv, and when I do, I usually just watch whatever is being played at the time- I have never really been one to become obsessed, especially not with drama. However, I have been hooked with Downtown Abbey since the first episode I watched. Within just a couple of days, I watched all of the episodes on Amazon Prime and can not wait to be able to see how they continue the story line! I highly recommend this tv series (the UK version, which appears to be much more complete), with all of its beautiful scenery, twists and turns in the plot it is hard to get anything done around the house! I also appreciate the historical context, which makes the story line seem so much more ""real.""This series is a must see!"
5,Obsessed with these Brits!,"I'd heard so much about Downton, I finally gave it a shot. And now I'm obsessed. Don't know what it is exactly, but some combination of excellent acting, writing, timing and music make this a real winner for me. Do yourself a favor and check it out today!"
5,great escape!,addictive! am not a soap opera person ( have never watched one before) but with all the characters and plotlines totally engrossing!
5,Love the drama,Nice drama and love the acting of each and every one. It's a true master piece.Looking forward to see more seasons.
5,A TREASURE,"This series is such a treasure into the past and the interconnection between the wealthy, and the situation of some of the working class, that existed in prewar WWI. Just witnessing the attitudes and ways in which they carried out their daily lives and duties, in that era, has been an education and delight. The last moments of Season 1, when the announcement that war had been declared was stunning. The expressions of disbelief, shock, horror, excitement, etc. These poor souls had no idea what was actually coming to an end and the true horror of everything that would eventually take place. I so look forward to Season 2."
5,"Upstairs, Downstairs...","A show about people who live a different way. I wouldn't mind living either upstairs or downstairs, in service or being served, if it meant living with these fine people."
4,The Way It Was,"Wonderfull look at pre ww I England! The characters, sights and story are fascinating. A great way to take a trip in time."
4,Original DVD,This was more like a gift to my sister. She really loved the series and appreciates the quality. Thank You.
3,Downton Abbey,marvelous series. I had borrowed Session I and II from friends. The 3rd disc from I cracked due to being so tightly wedged into the case. We therefore had to replace the whole of part one. We were very careful with part 2. I would advise anyone purchasing this series to be careful.Patti
4,Downtown Abbey Season One,"I liked it, but I haven't continued to watch the rest of the series since, but they have moved the past into the present as the cycle of civilization repeats the mistakes of the past. It's a good example of why some Brits warned us when we started our folly in Afghanistan, they've 'been there, done that' and failed as we here in the States have. They just didn't understand that the war wasn't meant to be a 'success' in the normal sense, but as a 'foot in the door' for more war in the Middle East and the world as we prepare the NWO, ie. Global Police State.Has the series covered this in Season 2? I don't know, nor if Season 3 will, but it should and time is running out for such 'work' to be of any use other than public distraction from reality. All that said, this series is a nice distraction."
5,This show is worth buying,What a great show! The stars in this show are fantastic! Not a dull moment. Can't wait to see the next episode!
2,Show great connection bad,"The actual show was good but the feed kept stopping and it took almost 2 hours to watch it, which almost took away from the show itself."
4,Downtown Abby Season 1 was very good,We had heard this was a good series and we liked it so much we watched the whole series over the weekend.
5,Riveting and unassuming!,"With the utmost subtlety, the drama unfolds with no fluff and fanfare. The writers don't have to try too hard because each character stands strong on their own, and each just as important and interesting as the next. The character development is realistic and sympathetic, and you never love nor hate anyone for too long before they surprise you. Who knew a period drama like this would find such a cult following? Rightfully so!"
2,Not for me...,"A previous reviewer called this show an ""upscale Soap Opera,"" and I must say, I agree completely. I am personally not a fan of soap operas, and wished I would have seen that description of the film before watching it. While represented as a typical costume drama (which normally I adore), this definitely is more of a ""period"" soap opera. It is all drama, and the end was extremely disappointing to me. Not all bad, but pretty depressing and somewhat misrepresented in my opinion."
1,DVD won't play,For some unknown reason I am unable to play these two DVD's. Apparently the Region Rating is incorrect. I have previously purchased DVD's from Amazon and have not had this problem before. Hence I will need to return both and hopefully you can send replacements which work in Australia. Am bitterly dissappointed.
5,Great to watch,I am hooked on this show. This is better than anything on TV. Can not wait to get up to date with this season.
3,downton abbey,"Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey (Original UK Unedited Edition)I am extremely disappointed in this supposedly ""unedited version"" there is indeed a great deal of material missing from the series which I had watched last season. I am awaiting the release of this years episodes and thought it might be fun to rewatch last years, only to find that vast sections were missing. Very, very disappointed."
3,I love Elizabeth McGovern,"We thought the movie was great. My husband, sister and I watched it all and felt the ending let you down,the ending could have been better."
5,Great show,Just got into the show and its very entertaining. I wish that season three was free for prime users as well never will that be!
4,Cant Wait for Next Season,Watched this on PBS. I missed some pieces so I had to buy it. Great to watch. Loved the period wardrobe. The acting was also great.
5,Great series,Couldn't quit watching. The story line is excellent and can't wait for the next season. Just loved it and recommend it!
2,Disappointed Viewer,"Anyone who has viewed Downton Abbey via Masterpiece Classics will quickly discover many scenes have been cut from the UK verson. So many cuts that one has to ask too many questions that will not be answered. The holes are numerous leaving one dissatisfied and disappointed.The series presented on PBS' Masterpiece Classics is absolutely outstanding, the full story with no questions left unanswered.I purchased my copies via PBS and promptly returned them for a full refund. The UK version apparently the only one available however, the uncut version can be viewed on the Netflix website. If an uncut version does become available, I will be one of the first to purchased."
5,"Brilliant show, stupid fans.","1. PBS does not make ANY of these shows. PBS is little more than a syndication network. They show good shows, but they should not be given so much credit for just picking a show produced in Britain to air.2. Masterpiece Theatre is just a name for the timeslot they put these SYNDICATED shows on. Again, Masterpiece Theatre has no say or involvement in any of the shows they air.That said, this is a brilliant piece of telelvision produced by ITV. I feel it stands up well compared to other period dramas, such as Larkrise to Candleford made by the BBC.As for the 1star reviews complaining about the homosexual relationship shown. Would you be as upset if it were a male and female relationship being shown? Homosexuality is nothing to be offended by, and if you're going to call it inappropriate and shameful, it says more about you than the show."
2,"Beautiful, well acted, dreadful plot and writing","Downton Abbey is addictive. The sets are lush, the acting is wonderful, but the plot and sometimes the dialog have all been done before. It is a pastiche of Upstairs, Downstairs and Mrs. Miniver. I was appalled that an entire subplot was lifted almost word for word from Mrs. Miniver. For Greer Garson substitute Penelope Wilton, for Dame May Whitty substitute Dame Maggie Smith, even the dialog is almost verbatim! The plot twists are right out of Upstairs Downstairs (remember Albert the footman?)and headlines of the 1970s -- shades of Nelson Rockefeller!Downton Abbey is a like an old Hollywood set -- beautiful facade with absolutely NO substance."
5,Best TV series I've watched,"If you're thinking of getting hooked on Downton Abbey you will not regret! Season 1 I think is one of the best, and it was great being able to watch this on my Kindle."
5,I missed Seasons 1 and 2 on TV!,I was very pleased to be able to watch all the past episodes on my Kindle. They were wonderful! Thanks for this service!
5,Downtown Abbey series is spell binding,This series is a wonderful account of life in the early 1900's in England giving a view of the way life was lived by both the affluent and those who serviced them. It also shows the impact of WWI on England. And it shows above all the values and morals prevalent and important in that era. Quite a contrast to today's society!
1,de-lama,i loved the series. So after getting it for my BD what a disappointment. It keep jumping from scene to scene or distorting so badly you could not tell whats going on. Please tell me how to check DVD quality without open it. Of cause after opening only half the refund.
1,Disappointed but read on,"Alas, I was looking forward to this series on my large TV using Apple Tv remote. I can get sound but no picture. Did Amazon forwarn me of this happening? If so, I did not see it, and this would be my mistake. I feel totally ripped off. I can still watch it on iPad on which I ordered but might go ""blind""!"
1,Confusing,"This product had a ""region 2"" on it which I finally found out meant that it could only be played on DVD machines in Europe. At great frustration and expense I had to return it to England. I still haven't gotten my money back."
4,So I can buy this series before it is finished on Masterpiece?,I watched the first episode which started in my area--DFW TX--this last Sunday. Now I find it for sale on Amazon. First time I have been aware that I could buy a Masterpiece series before it was completed on US TV...I find that pretty strange that the production company would try to undermind its own American bankability...With the other Brit series carried over--like the Lyndley shows or Jane Tennison--we always had to wait until the series had played here to get the US DVD versions...Why this???
1,1080i/60,"1080i/60, this review is for the blu-ray disc transfer only. the series is a 5 star.What? I have tried to play this on both sony 470 and Lg 570 on 52 in and 32 in lcd led and both are doing the same thing. I watched this on pbs and did not have the experience i am having with these discs. They are choppy, jumpy, in any movement,even when someone walks downstairs. I don't know the technical term for it, but the picture is not smooth. flickers in motion. What was england thinking? why not 1080p/24?Maybe I have a bad batch run of both disc 1 and 2. Anybody else having this problem with this blu-ray. Ready to return. Hurts my eyes. I have tried all settings that I know about for flow motion on tv and player."
2,Totally unlikable characters,"I was SHOCKED by how much I hated this. I kept waiting for it to get better. I have to say, I typically adore this type of movie/tv and I even paid for it just a few days (unknowingly) before it became free and I'm still mad I paid money for it.While it's gorgeous and the acting is good and the writing is good, the story is just trope after trope, nothing original in the slightest. But worst of all, none of the characters are likable. I don't care about them, could not find any redeeming value in them whatsoever. McGovern is slightly likable, and you feel sorry for her, but at the end of it, I was left with the feeling of being robbed. Like, ok, now everything is going to suck even more than it did before and nothing that we just watched matters at all. Why? Ugh."
4,Great Series,So wonderful this show. It really has a story behind. Never have seen the first season so now I am catching up.
1,Downton Abby,Just in case anyone is wondering...DON'T buy it! Region 2 means it won't play on your DVD player here in the United States!
1,No Review,I cannot review because I did not pay for the video and asked it be removed from my TV and not be billed. I mistakenly thought it was free as for Prime members. I have watched a few episodes on TV near the end of the third season which I enjoyed.
3,It's okay,"Not many ""exciting parts"". Kind of slow but I'm only on 3rd episode...hoping it gets better. I did buy the entire season"
2,Downton Abbey Season 1,The disc would not play. Nothing is wrong with the player. Need to mail it back- don't have a protective shipper for it- need to buy one then will return it for a credit. Very dissappointed. Had purchased it for my 65th Birthday!!! TO watch with friends.
5,UK Version is Superb,Just caught up on Seasons 1 & 2. Thank God I didn't see the PBS version. Every moment of the UK version is a treasure. With Season 3 premiering soon my dilemma is do I continue with the dumbed-down version or wait however long for the UK version.
5,Great series!,Downton Abbey is a fantastic historical series set just before WWI. Great characters and plots. Looking forward to the 3rd season!
2,Blu-Ray not worth the extra money,"This is a review of the blu-ray version In the darker interior scenes the picture was very grainy, something I did not expect would be the case and overall it just didn't have the crystal clear sharpness of other blu-ray dvds I own."
3,Incomplete drama,"Think Gosford Park! Excellent cast - great acting. The story centers around a country estate/ castle with the charming english countryside as a backdrop. The social hierarchy and the intrigues are very entertaining and gripping..over 8 hours of viewing! The problem is the DVD ends abruptly ....to be continued. Think Monarch of the Glen but even less complete. So the plan, I take it, is to drag this show across several seasons. I would not have bought this DVD knowing that the story is left incomplete - very incomplete."
5,DA Season 1,I wanted to see what all the fuss was about and now I know! It's definitely worth the time to watch!
5,Wonderfully written.,"This show is fascinating and very well written for a modern audience. There are so few shows out there that are written by writers anymore. It's wonderful to find something I can actually watch. It is intelligent and draws attention to social inequalities and complexities much like an Austen or Bronte novel, but for a modern audience."
5,Great Show!,"i love this new TV show find!I am an Amazon Prime member, so i am even more excited that i can stream this show for free :)"
5,Could not stop watching!,Started watching this show rather belatedly on a recommendation. It was so thoroughly absorbing that I watched all of Season 1 and 2 in 3 days. Completely absorbing. The acting is wonderful and the story lines(while a bit soap opera-ish) are captivating. Now the only problem is that Season 3 does not come out until early 2013!!
5,I love it!,"If you havrn't watched it, you don't know what you're missing. I would give it 10 stars if I could! The story is great and the characters even better."
5,Wonderful,"Since I missed this on the TV, I bought the two seasons at the same time and watched it over the summer. Enjoyed it thoroughly. Wonderful cast of characters and great in depicting the history of the times."
5,An excellent production worthwhile for everyone,"A fascinating look at England in the teens and twenties. Enjoy the palace-like country houses, with the aristocracy upstairs and the servants downstairs"
5,Downton Abbey Season 1 ignited my interest,"I wasn't sure I would like a ""soap opera"" based in Victorian England, but from the first episode I was hooked. The setting is visually pleasing, the dialogue engaging, and the plots move and twist with intriguing pace."
3,Not what I expected,"I had heard a lot about Downton Abbey, but the first season is rather hard for me to get through. I'm pushing it though, because I hear the second season is much better.One thing, the likable characters are quite likable and the not so great ones are really really awful."
5,wonderful,Very entertaining. Great drama and with no violence. I'm hooked on this series. I look forward to it every week.
5,Love Downton Abbey,I was missing this specific episode and watched it from Amazon. It was streamed perfectly. Now I wish I hadn't finished Season 3 so quickly. I have a year to wait for Season 4!
5,A Fascinating Entertaining Series!,"Thought I was not interested in this series. Apparently I was wrong. One evening, I thought what the heck, I would try just one. Four hours later I had to make myself go to bed. I was now hooked. Well written, well acted, a compelling series."
4,A Good Surprise,I wasn't sure i would like the show but after finding episode 1 of the first season on instant for free i am going to have to get the rest of the seasons.
5,excellent,It's a wonderful show. Wish we had more quaility entertainment on tv. The different personalities and story lines make it intriguing. Also seeing how people lived in those castles.
5,Fantastic and beautiful,"I love this series, and (almost) all the characters in it. Oh, the drama, both upstairs and downstairs! Most of the characters are interesting and have depth, though I'd like to see more development of the bad eggs... they're just so unrelentingly bad, it makes me want to know why and whether they can be redeemed. More than anything, though, what I love about Downton Abbey is all the beautiful places and things. The costumes, the house, everything -- it's just so crisp and comes alive."
5,Love This Series~,Wonderful series and can't wait to see them all. Looking forward to the next year's installments and Shirley McLaine! yeah!
1,does not fit,"I bought it for the Chinese ""brandless"" demolition hammer and it does not fit. They were advertising that it was bought together. They have a different model now and it fits.So one star for not being for the right product but otherwise it looked ok."
5,Dennis the ....,Excellent movie worth showing to all age levels.As A teacher my students truly enjoyed the showing and getting the movie so quickly from amazon was awesome.
1,VERY excited to receive my movie BUT disappointed it skipped a lot...,I was VERY EXCITED to receive my movie in a timely manner. Unfortunately.. the movie skipped a lot and skipped through several chapters. :(
2,movie review,"Movie we bought was damaged towards the end, it skipped, didn't find out until after the fact, we didn't watch it until a month later??"
3,Mostly fun,"We didn't appreciate the use of God's name in vain.Additionally, for a kids movie, it had too much ""adult"" humor."
4,Family fun!,Dennis the Menace is such a cute film! This is a great film for the whole family. I highly recomend it!
5,Replaced our vhs tape version,"We have replaced our vhs tape version. The grandchildren as well as us always enjoy Dennis and Mr. Wilson matching wits and the poor parents just trying to stay afloat and who does not love Martha, the peace maker."
5,funny,We love this movie.a laugh a minute!! So movies were meant to be watched over & over this is one of them!!!!
5,Great Movie,"Watching this movie takes me back to my kid years. My friend, whom I grew up with, and I would watch this movie together a lot. I bought this movie on dvd a few weeks ago and watched it for the first time today. I enjoyed watching the special features. They talked about finding the perfect Dennis. I think they made the right choice. Walter is a perfect Dennis. He is a total crack up and cutie. His looks haven't changed much. He still looks like a cute boy. There's also a game for your child or your self to play on the special features. This is a great movie. If you have kids or not you must buy it."
1,Horrible,"At the time of writing this review, Dennis the Menace has 4.5 stars. After watching it with my kids, I think it's horrible. There isn't much of a plot, and Dennis doesn't actually spend all that much time annoying Mr. Wilson as he did in the cartoon. There are several sexual references which could have been left out, and a scene with teenagers making out on a couch, none of it really is needed for the plot and especially isn't needed in a movie targeted towards young children. The ""bad guy"" in the movie is extremely creepy and you're not really sure what he's up to (is he some kind of pedophile?!?). In short, I found the whole movie to be awful. I found the Dennis the Menace cartoon to be entertaining and fun, but this movie was neither."
4,Hilarious.! It possibly would keep down crime.,"I was saddened to hear a word Walter Matthou used and I have forgotten now other than swearing, But other than that, the innocence of a child. Would love the world to know that to harm one of these children is against our Creator and will be judged by a righteous judge."
3,"Contrived and unoriginal, but entertaining","This movie is completely contrived and unoriginal (rip-off of Home Alone, released 3 years prior to this one); however, Matthau and Gamble have genuine chemistry. In fact, it's worth watching the movie just for Mason Gamble; he is absolutely adorable and completely plausible as the misunderstood Dennis Mitchell."
1,"Cheap disc, broke when I opened it.",The case had been smashed or something because it had a huge indentation when I first lifted it from the box. Then when I tried to take the disk out it just snapped in one spot probably due to the trauma it underwent with the damaged box. Waste of money.
3,Dennis the Menace is great,"Both my grandchildren, ages 5 and 3 , were glued to the screen. They love it., and so does their Dad. He remembers it from when he was a kid."
5,too funny,"We just laughed and laughed . . . excellent for parents who think their kids are so bad, and great for parents with grown children to help remember the fun things they went through themselves. We talked about the hilarious things the kids did when they were younger."
4,Watched this with my almost 3 year old,I think we got more enjoyment out of it at time but he seemed to enjoy the movie at times.
5,"A funny, fantastic, family movie!","My entire family just loves this movie. I really can't see how someone would be scared to show this to his or her children. The reality is, there ARE NASTY PEOPLE out there in this world like the villain in this movie!!! And if kids are scared of him while watching it, GOOD! Then they will be more afraid to talk to strangers. I think the actor who plays Dennis is adorable and did a fantastic job of being mischievous yet innocent at the same time. And Walter Matheau, well he really makes this movie a joy to watch! I've watched this movie a dozen or more times and I still always find myself laughing throughout the whole thing. This is a great movie for kids and adults alike."
5,They Work Perfectly,I got several of these. The price was right and they work perfectly. How much can you say about a cable? It works perfectly...get it.
4,Great music from Jars Of Clay!,"Although this 4-track album is not as good as some of their other music, it is still worth listening to. The arrangements of The Little Drummer Boy deliver the Christmas spirit. I recommend buying this CD if you enjoy Jars Of Clay music."
1,There is nothing to review,"I would like to review this film but I can not because I have not received it yet. Apparently, you have sent it three times but never got to me. It is like a joke. Can you check your tracking mail number and make a claim to whoever in the post?Regards,Jose"
2,obselete ; buy the new one,"Got this model about two years ago. It was the only choice at the time that could pronounce words. It worked OK, the vocabulary was limited ; probably OK for spanish intermediate level at the most. It was plagued with poor design though. really bad battery door design resulting in intermittent operation. Hard to use volume control. unreliable connecter in the back for inserting other books, poor contrast made it difficult to read, and my son at one point adjusted it to minimum while playing with it and the display totaly disappeared. Took lot of blind hit and trial to get to the settings menu to get it back. pls designers leave the minimum contrast adjustment at a level that can still be seen. About two years of use the top half of the display stopped working.It has been replaced by a better model that is thin and smaller. Get that instead."
3,Incomplete Conjugations. TOEFL??? What about TOESL???,"Initially I was attracted to this translator because of the number of translations and of course the speaking part.After using the translator for a period of time I have become somewhat disastisfied. The conjugations only provide for the Yo form, failing to include Tu, Ud, El, Nosotros, Vosotros, Ellos. Additionally, the previous version of this translator included more conjugation forms than the new one. Additionally, the translator ignores needs of native english speakers. It only provides the TOEFL vocabulary exercises and not a TOSFL (Test of Spanish as a First Language)."
2,second year spanish student,"I had great hopes for this machine. Immediately I noticed that the first line of the entry always seemed to be in a dark shadow and I had to try tipping the unit to get light into the inner screen to make it readable. It too often doesn't have the words --- even many very common ones in its database. The voice is extremely fuzzy when you try the audio pronunciation feature. It only has a few forms of many of the the words I am seeking. If this unit really has 250,000 words -- as they tell us---then they should create a new one with a couple of million"
3,Good Toy for Learning Spanish,"After reading all of these negative reviews I almost didn't buy this. I'm glad I did. I am using it as a compliment to my Pimsleur Speak and Read program. You can program a list of 40 words you are trying to learn and then use the games to help you memorize them. I prefer Hangman. I also use it to look up words because it is smaller and easier to use than my desk dictionary. If you want to learn Spanish, buy the Pimsleur program. The speaking function is worthless on the BES-1840. It is difficult to understand and the pronunciation is wrong many times. Also it is somewhat pricey but it makes a good toy for learning Spanish."
4,conjugator and dictionary,"As a conjugator and dictionary, it is wonderfully portable instead of lugging around a comprehensive verb book and dictionary. Another reviewer said it conjugates for the ""yo"" form only- which is completely wrong. They obviously didn't read the directions- all you do is keep pressing the conjugate button and it cycles thru the different tenses. The talking aspect helps point you in the right direction as far as pronunciation, but it is not always understandable- it definitely is not in stereo."
4,Better than a paper dictionary,"I like being able to find words quickly, in either English or Spanish, with this dictionary. It contains a large number of words, and it conjugates verbs. There have been quite a few times it has not had a word I requested. Its important weaknesses are that it translates only words and does not recognize phrases; also, the speaking voice is fuzzy. I also noticed that it mispronounced one Spanish word (pajaro). On the up side, mine has worked well for 3-4 years, and it does not require frequent battery changes."
3,Good if you are planning to tile a bathroom,This CD gives you instructions on how to tile a bathroom. I wanted basic instructions about tiling but it's more for advanced tiling projects.
4,gut! (good in german),DIS BOOK WAS GUT!i recommend dis book topeople dat love to cook in German.austrianor swisse.
5,Worth the money...,"Although these filters are expensive, it has improved the gas mileage, and the car seems to run better. I'm glad I bought it, and no more searching for disposable filters....Yeah! It was a little cheaper on Ebay, though, but this seller shipped quickly."
4,salt air does a job,"I love the looks of this fan and the sturdiness. But there are a couple of issues that I had. One issue is when I adjusted the tilt, the fan would fall out of the tilt once it was running in oscillation for a few minutes. No matter how tight I got it, it would do this. Also, after having it for a year in a home by the ocean, it started squeaking. Finally it wouldn't run at all. We had to take it totally apart and spray wd40 in it. Now it is working well again."
2,Disappointed,Beutiful fan but the occilator switch did not work. Also heavy and difficult for a senior to assemble. I would order another one but I am afraid something else might be wrong.
1,1hr auto shut off,"Bought this for starting seedlings and it is no good due to the auto shut off after 1 hour. Shipped from Amazon with free super savers shipping which was fast so no complaints for amazon, just this product."
2,"Quirky, and not long lived","When this pad is fired up, there is a burst of high heat for a while before it settles down to whatever setting you've put it on. Even if you only want low heat, you're going to get a burst of higher heat for a while first. It is comfortable, but it did not last well, and I cannot recommend it."
2,Not a great heating pad,"I got this pad for Christmas and it hasn't worked properly since day 1. The problem is it just doesn't get very hot and shuts off after 10 minutes. I am currently doing Chemo, so I need it for the aches and pains I get. I have another 3 year old pad from another company otherwise I would have returned it."
3,ok,This pad is soft but.... you have to unplug it to turn it off. I haven't washed it yet. I wouldn't buy another 1
1,This has Auto Shut off.,"This procut has Auto Shut Off. So if you don't want this, don't order. All other with Auto Shut off state this."
1,MAKE A DIFFERENT SELECTION!,"I did a lot of research for heating pads because they are not cheap. I chose this one because of the features. It is long, soft, has a long cord, and offered several heat settings. The highest setting did not even get warm! It blinks, and blinks, and blinks. I ended up trying three different heating pads, and found one with comparable features that I was seeking, and it gets hot! Not warm! Hot!! It is a Sunbeam Ultraheat, and that is what it is! I have pain from my lower back to my calf so this covers a lot of the area, and it offers moist heat as well. This Softheat brand is exactly that. Soft heat as in no heat. I hope this review helps other consumers, and saves you time from having to return it. Good luck!"
1,Failed after just over a year,"I really liked this heating pad. It replaced a 40-year-old heating pad that failed. Just over a year after I bought it, it failed. I am so disappointed in this product."
1,Don't buy!,"I wish I had read these reviews before buying this pad. I have had this pad 2 1/2 days. It seemed to work fine the first time I used it. The next time I turned it on and all times since it has heated inconsistently. Now it is shutting itself off after 5 - 20 minutes use, requiring me to unplug it each time to reset. Looks like I'll be returning it tomorrow. (I had a similar Sunbeam pad that lasted for years with no problems. I decided to replace it when the cord insulation cracked.)"
1,All burnt up! Buyer beware!,My heat pad caught electric fire. I've had mine for about 5 months. I had it on my neck area and I kept hearing popping and sizzling. Then that burnt plastic smell. I got it unplugged and stopped the fire. Although I have a small burn mark on my neck. Never had a heat pad do that. What a bunch of junk!
1,FLAMES,"When this pad worked I liked it, but I've had issues with it. My mom and I have the same pad, and we had the same problem. It seems like there is a short somewere in the wireing because the when I used it, it would switch on and off many times and the red light wold blink very rapidly. I always knew it wouldn't turn on if the red off light was blinking fast. I think this same short caused this very dangerous problme. I woke up today and turned my pad on and I smelled something scorched. I looked around and I wasn't sure what it was. I left my room and came back, I layed back down and the smell got worse. I picked up the pad and where the chord met the first part of the clip, it sparked and a fairly good sized flame sprang up. I'm so glad that I was in the room or my bed would have caught on fire. I was really shaken and upset because I would have been hurt and the heating pad was only a little over a year old. I would have expected that for what I paid for it it would have been safer."
1,Don't Waste Your $$,"I was really happy with the design of the pad when I first purchased it. It had no sharp plastic corners to poke me and was big enough to cover my whole back. My pad lasted a little longer than the other reviewers' pads... several months. It quit working, so thinking there may be a bad fuse, I took the controller apart. Yep, a bad fuse. Only problem? It's saudered directly to the board. I can't just pop it out and replace it. Based on this and the other reviews, I definitely will not buy another SoftHeat heating pad."
2,Would not buy another one,"This is a good heat pad if you don't like a lot of heat. The highest setting feels like warm and when I put it on warm setting I can't even tell it is on. The only thing good about it is that it's quilted and you can machine wash it, but there are other quilted brands that give off more heat than this piece of junk."
1,SoftHeat Ultra Heating Pad Moist,"Boy I wish I had read the customer reviews before buying this pad... The auto off feature totally sucks, it should be a selectable feature not default. I was under the impression after reading the description that the auto off feature was only on the pro models and the one i bought didnt say anything about being a promodel... I love the size, too bad it dosnt work..."
1,WORKED WELL FOR TWO MONTHS - THEN BROKE - THUMBS DOWN,"I purchased the Kaz Ultra King Size Heating Pad off eBay to replace another Kaz heating pad that stopped working after 2-3 months. Well, this is no different except I now have more expensive heating pad that is useless. Just like the other reviewers, my controller suddenly started blinking red and would not allow me to press any other button to start the heat process. I plugged and unplugged the unit several times with several long time increments each time. I also tried holding down all of the hear setting buttons for several seconds, sometimes two or three at once. Nothing worked. Its was nice while it lasted-- heated well without getting too hot. It is just a shame that the quality could not last for more than two months. Thumbs down!DO NOT PURCHASE A KAZ SOFTHEAT HEATING PAD IF YOU VALUE YOUR MONEY."
4,Grrrreat Stroller! Worth the money.,"Lightweight, easy to fold plus it stands on its own when folded. Which comes in handy when I am alone w/ my daughter. I also love that it has a tray that my lil one uses as a foot rest. Smoothest ride in town. One con is that the stroller shade isn't big at all not enough sun shade, so I brought a sun shade."
5,Essential,"Essential and great acquirement to all ACIM students, particularly latin. I have both versions, English and Spanish. They have elemental explanations of Kenneth Wapnick as an important and concise beginning to the Course."
4,Buy It!,"My dad bought this game for me. I was surprised when I opened it. The gameboard was huge and colorful! It is a fun game slightly resembling Monopoly. My sister, 7 years old, played it with me, and she liked it too. The only downside is that the big rollercoaster pieces don't stay together very well. It is also kind of a long game. All in all, I would buy it.P.S. This game is great for 2 players too. It may not seem like much, but only people with 2 person families know how hard it is to find games that 2 people can play."
4,"Some good, some bad","The game play is pretty fun, although I usually beat my 6 year old because he spends all his money right away and I win the rest of the auctions for the minimum. The game takes a little long to play, and it is bad to set up, with so many pieces and tokens. We have only played it a few times because it is a pain to set up, but when we do play, it is fun."
3,Aahh.. It's OK.,"I own Roller Coaster Tycoon 2. I just got it today. The instructions are useless, but then again, I just got the CD with the little paper inside of it. I managed (sort of) to get the hang of it on my own.. I like watching the people. ...It's an OK game."
2,ok if you are ten,"This game is for kids not adults. It is very short game play, not much strategy, and the cardboard coasters fall apart. If I were ten again I would enjoy this game. If you love playing the computer version of this game chances are you will not like this board game. It will just end up sitting on your shelf taking up space."
3,A little disappointing,I was quite disappointed that the pictures are in black & white .. no color. Some of the pictures are so small you can't see the animals. The book lacks organization. The pets are adorable!
4,"Fits well, does the job","The cincher fits well and cinches. It also has a nice retro-sexy look. I wish it were longer, it does not go down as far on me as the model in the picture. But, I have a long torso. It's surprisingly comfortable, for a compression garment, and getting it on is easier than the compression/stretch tanks."
5,Something for everyone,"In the last decade, I have been committed to pursuing answers to spiritual questions. I have read books by several of the authors Jeff presents in his book and although I believe I have grown and have developed a deeper understanding of myself and of universal laws, I find this book to be a valuable asset to my journey. The author presents simple, yet profound, insights in an easy-to-follow format, designed for those just getting started in their spiritual journey but also is an excellent resource for someone who considers themselves a ""seasoned"" spiritual seeker, as I do. It definitely has become a handy reference for me, providing me with countless reminders and deeper insights."
5,Simply Marvelous,"One's spirtual journey is not simple, however Jeff makes you believe it can be. I think what makes this book so easy to understand such a complex topic is Jeff's clear, concise discussion of spiritual concepts supported by very personal experiences of his spiritual journey that help the reader to not only understand but believe. The best part is he has done all the research for you, and gives you the tools and direction to continue your own journey of self discovery. This book will open your mind to life's possiblities you never dreamed of.Thank You Jeff."
5,A book for everyone...,"Spirituality Simplified is an insightful, thought-provoking and inspirational introduction to a variety of spiritual topics. The tone is friendly and not at all intimidating, with the author supplementing general principles with his own personal experiences and excerpts from some of today's most respected spiritual teachers. If you're interested in learning more about the complex topic of spirituality, this simple book is the perfect starting point."
5,SHOW UP!!!!!!!!!,THIS IS ONE OF JOHN P KEE'S CLASSIC CD. I LOVE EVERY SONG. THIS CD BLESS MY SOUL. THE BAND IS OFF THE CHAIN. NOW I CAN SEE WHY EVERYBODY HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS CD. THIS CD PUT HIM ON THE CHARTS AND WITH AWARDS. THIS IS A BLESSING. IF YOU ARE A JOHN P KEE THEN YOU NEED TO GET THIS CD. THIS IS OFF THE CHAIN
4,The Secret Garden-DVD,"A charming story well told. The children were very good and Maggie Smith added her particular excellence as only she can do. Compared to the book, it seemed somewhat rushed; the development of the children's characters was not given enough time methinks. Otherwise enjoyed it very much."
5,Beautiful & fun movie,"My kid loves this movie, and it's something that adults can enjoy, too. The visuals are gorgeous, and then there's Maggie Smith (the British Gene Hackman, who's fun to watch in anything)."
2,Too many lunges,I was really looking forward to this video because I had to cut back on impact due to soreness in my knees. I thought less jumping would be better. I found this video to be far worse on my knees than jumping. The discs are more work on my knees and the video is primarily using discs and lunges. I would be better off with a higher impact than this to help save my knees.
4,Solid workout,"I consider myself at an intermediate-advanced level of fitness.Another solid workout from this instructor. The usual non-annoying backup crew, decent cues, non-intrusive music with a beat, high production quality with excellent camera work.I substituted higher impact moves since I do not have/use the gliding discs. I believe you may get an even more intensive workout with the discs since I can see that you would really have to use your core on top of everything else but regular impact (jumping etc.) works also to give you a good workout.Overall, this was, perhaps, not quite as exciting to do as previous workouts but still went by quickly and, more importantly, is an effective workout."
5,Insanely Awesome,"I recently injured my hip and was told I could only do low-impact workouts for the next six weeks. This really bummed me out because low impact workouts are usually not high intensity. Well, after doing this workout I've changed my mind. This is a very well rounded and extremely intense workout. My heart rate stays above 85% the entire time and, according to my Polar HR monitor, I burn just under 500 calories with this workout. I also come out soaking wet. By far, the best cardio workout I've ever done."
4,Kicked my butt,"This video held true to its promise - it didn't feel quite so crazy when I was doing it, but then the next day I felt the ""afterburn"". Actually I felt it for the next couple of days! The only thing I was a little sad about was the small amount of time devoted to core exercises."
4,Challenging workout,"I have been looking for workouts that use more body weight resistance and are challenging. I have had some running injuries over the past couple of years and look for routines that incorporate the more challenging exercises that my physical therapists want me to work towards. I had heard Cathe Friedrich produces great workout videos and I wasn't disappointed.I work at my own pace on some of the intervals and modify certain exercises to a lower level. But I was still fighting to get through the video. Afterburn is not for the faint of heart, but I can't wait to do it again and try some of her other routines.My only issue is that I bought this on Amazon On Demand so I don't have another DVD to add to my collection. About 45 minutes in the video restarts at the beginning and I have to fast forward through this to get to the last 15 minutes or so of the workout. What happened Amazon?"
3,This book sucks,"The text is such a broad overview that it is meaningless unless you already know the history of Irish immigration, in which case, why do you need this book? If you are only going to have one book in your collection about Irish history between 1840 & 1920, this should not be it. If you already have other books about Irish emigration spurred by the potato famine, this one might be worth it for the illustrations. The editors did a good job of selecting photographs for the Library of Congress and other archives that are compelling by their own rights."
4,good lessons for engaged learning,"My toddler LOVES all the My Baby Can Talk DVDs and has learned every sign that matters to him - help, more, please, cracker, shoes, socks, car.... It's great to be able to communicate with him. We found the model to be a little off-putting, but her signing is clear and our little guy can understand. The DVD employs generalization, which helps teach each sign as a concept, and places it in context. The music is hinky, but works somehow. In any case, despite production flaws, the structure and design of these DVDs is solid and works."
1,Boring...,"My son never liked the DVD, it's very boring! He LOVES baby signing time, it's so much better!!!"
3,Not as good and the first one.,My daughter loves the my first words DVD in this series and she likes this one but hasn't learnt any signs from it yet. We will keep at it though. It's good to have for some variation.
1,DEAD SPOTS,This product has many dead spots. At least a quarter can not be watched. I don't understand how this could happen. Isn't someone responsible for quality control.
4,The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit,This movie is very good. When I got the UPS package it was very good quality and very well packaged.
4,Full Screen Sucks ......... most of the Time!,"DVD Movies have many great features: great picture quality, making of documentaries, trailers and much more. However my favorite feature would have to be ""Widescreen"". So that is why I was so disappointed when I found out this movie was full screen. I bought this movie anyways, because at less I could replace my old faded VHS tape with superb color and sound and it did. However it did more than that. Upon closer comparison I noticed that was getting a lot more picture on the top and bottom and left and right of the screen!!!! On my 32 inch TV it's about and extra inch and a half more picture around the out side of the screen compared to my VHS tape. I was overjoyed and delighted by this discovery. So don't be too hasty in judge this movie if you love widescreen. Give it a chance it will be sure to please."
5,GREAT Movie! I Loved it!,I was fortunate to catch it on Disney a few days ago. Luckily I go to bed late and watch Disney now and then cause shortly before I went to bed Disney advertised that this movie would be on..it was on VERY early one morning and I LOVED IT! I would love to find out more about the horse in the film...cause I am absolutely HORSE NUTS! GREAT MOVIE! Wouldn't mind watching again soon!
4,Made In Thailand but Sounds Like a Million Bucks!,"This is a great remastered version of the Eagles 3rd album which also comes in a mini-lp sleeve replica. It looks and sounds like its much more expensive Japanese cousin but comes at a fraction of the price. Hard to think of any greater bargain than this. The sound quality is very good considering how old the master must be. Also, although most of the tracks rarely show up in best of compilations, there isn't really a weak track here. We get a good mix of country and soft rock as well as harder stuff like ""James Dean"". ""Best of My Love"" and ""Already Gone"" are on at least one of the compilations that are out there but the title track is also very good and would not be out of place on a best of compilation. A much better effort than even their first album and recommended at this price to any Eagles fan as a great bargain."
3,"Not the best, not the worst from the Eagles","Thanks for reading. Actually 3.5 starsI love all the Eagles albums, This is their third album, and not as good as their first two. Don Felder was a welcome addition to the band on this album, adding a rawer, harder, rockier edge to their music.Does contain some gems including ""Already Gone "" "" My Man"" "" Is it true"" and "" The best of my love""Fans will love it, but if you're new to the Eagles you might want to try some of their later stuff first.This is the best Eagles line-up, but they didn't quite get it right here. The Successor to this "" One of These nights"" is the best in my opinion.Still, this is a good album, and a must for fans of this genre!Enjoy!"
5,No Junior Year Slump Either,"Have you ever locked onto a band during their first album, only to be let down by the second and later discs? I remember the early evolution of the Eagles oh so clearly. The first LP caught my ear and the concept of the second moved the band to a new dimension. But this, the third album, was the big buzz for me. Sure, one album later the band was selling much bigger, but this disc was it - the crystalline moment, for the Eagles. Radio jumped on Best of My Love and James Dean while I was in the groove on Already Gone, Midnite Flyer, Good Day In Hell and Ol' 55. The addition of Don Felder catalyzed the band towards a more hard edged, harder rock sound. The Eagles never made it to the land of hard rock, but it sure looked like this album was going to take them there. Next time your boss or your woman or man pisses you off, crank up the volume and play Already Gone. It's pure auralgasmic bliss and reality be damned!"
4,The transition album,"This album definitely marked a transition for the Eagles from a country-rock sound to more rock. The album seems to be equally divided. There are five country-rock songs (You Never Cry Like a Lover, Midnight Flyer, My Man, Ol 55, Best of My Love) and five rock songs (Already Gone, On the Border, Is It True, Good Day In Hell, James Dean). All in all it makes for a great mix. Most folks are familiar with Already Gone and Best of My Love, but there are some pleasant hidden surprises as well. The oft-forgotten Bernie Leadon sings the beautiful My Man and the ""late addition"" of guitarist Don Felder provides some much-needed oomph toward the end of the album on Good Day In Hell. It's a typical Eagles album with great harmonies and great musicianship."
5,My favorite Eagles album,"I have felt that there were 3 different stages of the Eagles. Countryish, rock and the Joe Walsh influence. I consider this the best of the rock influence. I remember listening to good day in hell, on the border, already gone and James Dean the day the album came out and going wow because it was so different than the earlier albums. This was the first Eagles album that I have bought in each media incarnation, record, 8 track, cassette and CD (the record industry has made a fortune on me)Any way just the songs listed above make On the Border Worthwhile"
4,Great Overall Album - Remaster - I've Heard Better,"Great Album, I bought it when it came out 73, brings back some great memories listening to it. Always happy to hear the tunes that didn't get airplay way back when. Good Day in Hell, You Never Cry Like a Lover etc..... The remaster was not what I expected. I have purchased other Eagles remasters and this one didn't seem to have the crisp separation that others have had."
5,A Great one from Eagles,"Eagles / On The Border: The hits on this album are well known, but unlike some of their other albums, the other songs on the album are just as good as the hits and the album stands as one of their most consistent efforts. The album is typically short, but very much worthy of Five Stars."
3,So-so - though readable - and not Kelly's best,"The review below from bookjunkies encapsulates the very mixed feelings I have about this book. It's very readable, and I enjoyed it while I was reading; I liked Kate Billings and the troupe of actors very much. Hal Hampton, aka the Marquess of Graydon (not Everdon) was in some respects amusing, and even solicitous. But I am in complete agreement with the other reviewer: his reason for not helping Kate and the troupe out of their mess was not at all convincing. It seemed like a very convenient plot device for dragging out the story, and no more than that. I'm not at all surprised that Kate gave Hal a black eye when she discovered that he'd lied about the threat to his life!Other aspects of the plot, such as the marriage certificate, were extremely predictable; it was simply a matter of counting the pages until they happened.All in all, if you want to read a *really* good Carla Kelly, find Reforming Lord Ragsdale or Mrs Drew Plays Her Hand!"
1,Great while it lasted...,"Seriously, this is a wonderful invention. The pad is indeed soft, very flexible, the velcro is super-strength and it gets more than hot enough. Mine lasted about three months and that was not daily use. I'd love another but have to consider the inevitable problem of them just burning out one day even with careful use."
4,SoftHeat heating pad - king sized,"I've read some poor reviews on this product and I really don't know what all the complaints were about. I have been using this heating pad for about 3 months now, and I have had no problems. I would feel very comfortable recommending this product to someone else."
3,Large Heating Pad,Used it for two years virtually every day. It did its job and then stopped working. Replaced it with the same brand only smaller.
1,Don't buy,"It worked once. The next time I tried it, nothing. I've paid for a flashing indicator light and a worthless heating pad. What a waste of money."
5,Great buy,"Item was new, in good conditon. The item came fast and was a great buy. A+ buyer. Speedy shipper. Thanks again"
1,"Barely warm, on highest setting.","Picked this up today, spent the extra money on the deluxe...good size, soft, but nowhere close to enough heat. It barely gets warm & that's on the highest of 4 settings. Taking it back tomorrow & will try a different brand. Read several reviews on SoftHeat heating pads...many similar complaints about lack of heat. I have used Sunbeam in the past, & heat seems to be good, but they only last a few years, then don't heat up very much."
1,i hate the time-out,"i liked this heating pad...until the blinking light came on. i sometimes use a heating pad all evening. why should i have to turn it back on every 15 minutes? very annoying. mine heats well, but won't stay on. A mistake i won't make again."
3,"Great while it lasts, but doesn't last long","Had this pad for about 4 months. It worked great, and I loved the size of the pad, but like most of the other reviews my controller started blinking red and wouldn't work. Such a dissapointment and I don't want to waste money on another one if it is only going to last 4 months!"
1,Junk..,"This costs twice as much as the most popular brand and barely gets hot at all. I returned it after trying to use it for a day. I had to take the cover off to get any effect at all, and even then I could hold my hands flat on it and they get just slightly hot."
2,Turns off in 20 MINUTES - Argh,I love the size of this pad. The ties are especially useful for keeping it on at work. However its programmed to turn OFF after 20 minutes. I am here today shopping for one to replace this.
5,Soft heat heating pad by KAZ,I had a soft heat heating pad befor and it finally died. I had to have another just like it. I like the coverage and the way it settles into the area needing heat.
1,Worthless item...,Used 1 day when the light starting blinking and it stopped heating. The sunbeam company is just as worthless when I called KAZ the number on the pad they said well if you pay to mail it to us we will send you a new one ... Why should I pay them anymore for an item that is junk to get more junk????
4,Funny Exciting Travel,"Imagine a book co-written by Redmond O'Hanlon and Noel Coward: Funny, exciting, literate, a period piece that still works. Flemming, a young corespondant for the London Times, goes on a half-baked expidition to the heart of Brazil with a group of men both over- and underprepared for the adventure. I enjoyed the book immensely, although his light tone occasionally got to me."
3,Quite charming,"This is certainly not an adventure book in the classical sense. The style of writing does not allow for it. Buy it for its British humor and charm, not for adventures which don't take place."
3,Somewhat entertaining,"I bought this book because I am fascinated by South America, the Amazon River, etc..and also because this looked like a real life adventure book searching for clues into the dissappearance of Major Fawcett.This book starts out slow because of the british style of writing in the early 20th century. For me it was too ""flowery"" and maybe that is not the right word. I nearly stopped reading the book because of it, but I didn't. Thankfully, the last half of the book, describing the race back to civilization, was much better.This book is okay, but nowhere near great"
3,British subtlety,"I brought this book for my Brazilian trip this past Dec. I found this book slow and boring in the beginning. This may be due to the fact that the author used lot of what I assume to be late 19th and early 20th century references which I have no idea about and the British writing. But after half way through, I learned to read past the subtle British writing and concentrate on the story and this make the book more enjoyable."
1,waste of money,"Don't waste your money buying these jars!!!! The idea is great but this particular product is garbage. There was no brand name markings on the jars except for the ""made in Mexico"" sticker. Of the six that I received three were crack very badly. The rims are slightly warped and don't make a good seal. The plastic doesn't seem to be dishwasher safe as after a few washes they started crazing (cheap acrylic?). The manufacturer didn't even take the time to clean up the excess plastic when they cast the jars. Spend the extra money and get a brand name version since they do come in very handy."
3,8 oz Mini Jars,"I have been using these mini jars for more than forty years and for my style ofcooking they are very helpful in preparing and storing small amount of various spicesand refrigerate after each use.I DO NOT like the plastic variety currently supplied. They leak very frequently and givesa used look after some time. On the other hand glass jars does not leak, easy to clean,level of the contents can be seen easily, and gives a new look if washed properly. It is worththe slight extra it costs."
5,AWESOME PRODUCT!!,"These are essential for making my 7 month old's baby food! So far I think my favorite task was peeling a peach, dropping it into the container, attaching the blender blades and bottom of blender... a quick puree and POOF! Fresh peaches for my baby to eat!! And fresh baby food tastes SO much amazingly better than any other I've ever tasted! LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE JARS!! And the resealable aspect is incredibly handy when you don't use all that you made! :) BTW, I have a Hamilton Beach blender and it fits just fine!"
3,"solid, but pedestrian","You can get a lot out of this book as a basic introduction to Chinese civilization if you are willing to slog through it. It is clearly written and covers the essential facts, but it lacks taste and deep interpretation. In others words, it can be studied but should not be read for pleasure or even intellectual stimulation. I used it to complete certain gaps in my knowledge of Chinese history, which was necessary and useful, but it just feels so academic and pedantic. Maybe that is what must happen in most general survey introductions like this one: it is stripped down so far that it cut not just fat but muscle and bone. In contrast, ""The Search for Modern China"" by J. Spence is a work of art as well as history, and constantly stimulates the reader to probe deeper, farther, opening a world. Unfortunately, Fairbank and Goldman accomplished none of that."
3,Materially Rich But Disjointed,"My interest is ancient China. While ""China: A New History"" is materially rich, I found the topical layout disjointed. I have had to piece together bits of information on ancient dynasties from different sections. I also found the authors' commentary throughout the book distracting. I purchased ""China: Its History and Culture"" by Morton and Lewis and found it to be a well-written, materially rich book--excellent for anyone doing research on ancient China."
1,not much different from previous editions,"I bought this book because I was misled by the information displayed on Amazon's web site. This edition in its paperback form actually runs to 560 pages only, not to 640 pages as the ""product details"" claims. I was led to believe that this 2006 2nd enlarged edition was a major expansion over its previous edition, which I already possess. But no."
5,A visit to China,Excellent and comprehensive history of China. A must read for anyone going to see this country.
5,Great second recording from the VIP Choir!,"I remember having this album (in cassette form) years ago. The songs still resonate in my heart. John P. Kee seems to write and produce songs that just stay with you...I certainly haven't forgotten the selections on this CD, it's so uplifting and inspirational. Pick this album up if you want some early-90's John P. Kee nostalgia."
2,For the Novice Photographer,"Fielder's book provides the basics, at best, for those who don't already have some technical knowledge related to the art & science of photography. It is a good primer for those who are interested or already taking nature photographs but really haven't learned why it is they do what they do.There are, no doubt, better books out there that go into far more detail and if you already understand the basics of this hobby, then you may want to search elsewhere for a better education on this subject. If you don't already possess a basic knowledge of this stuff then this just might be a good place to begin.As with most of Fielder's other books, this is NOT a good coffee table book.And while he may not have graduated with a degree in photography, Fielder solved the dilemma of how to make money selling your work by creating his own publishing company and promoting his work through that model. It has obviously worked very well for him!"
1,Very Disappointing,"I bought this book because John Fielder is very well known throughout Colorado, and I assumed he must be a good photographer. Unfortunately, I later realized that he owns his own publishing company, and this is the only reason any of his photos get published. Do not buy this book. John Fielder is, at best, an average photographer. I would recommend, instead, the how-to books by Art Wolfe or John Shaw. Wolfe, in particular, is a far better photographer than Fielder, and certainly provides much better advice."
1,"Flat, flat, flat","Although Fielder is admirable in his persistance, ambitiously pursuing the ultimate bland shot is not the pinnacle of artistic endeavour. Fielder has little to no sense of composition...read Muench or Maeda, this is not a good ""how-to"" book...the author doesn't know how."
4,Organized,"In comparison to Galen Rowell's books, the content is better organized and it is quite a good reference book for landscape photography.If you have read any of Galen's books, you'll know that you literally have to mine for the relevant info in the midst of his philosophies and the accounts of his stories.This one is closer to the idea of a how-to book and quite similar to John Shaw's style."
2,He can take pictures but he can't write,"The entertaining diatribes in this customer review section to the contrary, John Fielder does know how to take striking large-format landscape pictures. I bought the book because I thought some of the pictures were really lovely. As a how-to book, though, it was a disappointment: derivative and boring and written in a smug, self-congratulatory style. Think of Donald Trump telling people how to do real estate deals and you get the idea. For example: ""By some undefinable mental process I have never allowed objects to be out of place, even unbalanced, in an image. Only when I began to study design theory did it become clear to me how I do what I do.""To me the class act in how-to photography books is Galen Rowell's ""Mountain Light."" John Long's books are also good. If you're looking to learn stuff instead of just look at nice pictures, buy anything by those authors in preference to this book."
4,"Novel, quirky in good humor","Certainly not for the people that want an overly dramatic movie, but if you want a short fun light hearted glimpse of a couple of hot chicks, this is the film for you."
1,Don't buy this ping pong table!,"This table was not as advertised. The ""padding"" on the underside was just some lick-and-stick small foam fingers that would not hold up. There were several screws missing from the supports which could not be replaced into the particle board. The stiffeners were very flimsy. The whole table seemed like it would not last at all. We returned it unused. Note to Amazon: you should stop offering this product."
2,FAIL,"This product is MDF and comes in two pieces. One person can put it on and off, though it's a little awkward because of it's size). It ships face on face with a thin strip (1/64"") of foam around the edges so when you get it it will be marred and chipped (the two face pieces are basically rubbed against themselves all the way to your house. Where the two pieces join in the middle (after you place them on your table is unfinished. I'm not sure why. I have a $12,000 billiard table and I WOULD NOT put this on my table without first putting a blanket on the billiard table. You are just asking for your table to be scratched. I sent mine back."
5,Aaron's Best Book Review On The Quick and the Dead,The Quick and the Dead is about a family traveling west and meeting up with a stranger named Vallian.There's also a band of murders who think they are carrying gold.It is full of action-packed adventure!I liked it.Maybe you will to!
5,Excellent Story of Survival and Humanity on the Frontier,"Picked this book up on a whim when taking advantage of Amazon's amazing 4-for-the-price-of-3 deal on Louis L'Amour novels. It turned out to be the best of the four!The story of a mysterious stranger who helps a tender-foot family survive in the unforgiving midwest, The Quick and the Dead has the action rolling from page two. The story never gets boring, and has an excellent cast of outlaws to hate. There also happens to be some beautiful insight into how a family can change when faced with hardship and unreasonable men.If you're looking for a quick, well-written, and enjoyable story you can't go wrong with this novel. And if you happen to be less thrilled than I was, you're not going to lose much time as the story is only 187 pages."
4,Pennsylvania is a good place to be during Christmas.,"I have just stared reading this book so to give a full critique on it would be difficult. What I have read thus far has been informative,entertaining, and well written. I believe this is going to be a very enoyable read.Knight68"
2,"Lovely packaging, uneven scents not very rosy","The set of three small bottles has delightful packaging with dried pink rosebuds in the box along with the products. It came with two free very small vials (perfume sample vials, if you are familiar with them), one of vanilla and the other of patchouli. The samples were useless to me as I dislike both as perfume scents. I wish they'd given me at least other floral scents to try.The three main bottles are: Sudanese Black Rose, Arabian Wild Rose, and French Rose. The Arabian Wild Rose is delightful, and I wish I could just buy that by itself. It was very rose scented, with only a touch of some other base note. The Sudanese Black Rose was not in the least rose scented and smelled sort of like a cross between medicinal and Catholic church incense. Not terrible, but not my thing. The French Rose smells like a combo of baby powder and soap, with no inkling of rose in there at all. Blech!!"
4,"quick, classic regency....","the theme of this regency-basically an arranged marriage, is thrown a loop when the heroines mynah bird says something about her old love at the wedding breakfast. What follows is a comedy and drama of errors. It was enjoyable, although the two main characters were a bit too stupid to live sometimes. The secondary characters, her irish friends, make the book.I'd recommend this book for a classic regency fan.4 stars."
3,Not the best Chesney.,"I would skip this one, the heroine is a bit cold and childish. You are not missing anything if you do not read this one."
4,Doesn't Last!!,"This toy is very cute, especially for Barney lovers! It sings a lot of different songs and lights up. The problem is that mine keeps running out of batteries after a day or so. It's ridiculous. I called Fisher Price and they said I can send it back to get it replaced, but I don't know, I might try one more set of batteries and see what happens."
3,okay,This magical friend barney was just like it was described so I was not disappointed. My granddaughter liked it a lot.
3,"Good general resource, but lacking in some areas","If you only need a general resource for looking up countries, cities and such, this book will do just fine. If you need specific information about a continent or region, find a more detailed book dedicated to that area. In most cases the lat/long of places was fairly accurate but many of the things I needed to refer to needed a finer coordinate. It also will go out of date fairly qucikly with the fast changing political climates of some areas. Great for stable areas, well developed countries, large to medium cities but not very effective beyond that."
4,For the Geographically Challenged,"This is an all-around good reference. It is well organized with readable sized print, and an excellent bargain.I use it for spelling purposes, clarification (where in the world is that?), population, and solving the odd crossword puzzle and acrostic. I use it far more than I thought I would, and it hasn't failed me yet.I am writing as an average consumer without specific professional needs in this reference. Judging by the easy format and the understandable structure, I would say I was the type of user the editors had in mind. I believe it would earn its keep on your reference shelf."
3,"far, far from complete","Missing many place names (I could only find half of the ones I needed). Especially weak for small countries, ethnic parts of other countries (Brittany, Basque names, etc.) and for eastern european countries. Weak for place names that might be in more than one language (German and Polish border place names, for example). I needed only European place names; I have no idea how this book measures up for other continents, if it is so mediocre for Europe."
5,Warning: Rave Review Ahead,"Personally, I say: If it's Rumiko Takahashi...GET IT NOW!!! My little sister has really been into manga since she got her first Inu-Yasha book, and so I picked up a movie by the same author (You got it---the Laughing Target!) At first, I thought ""Wow, this stuff is great! The suspense and conflict grow right till the end, and the dissolving photo bit after the credits makes for quite an ending!"" Also, I have quite an interest in the supernatural (That's why I like ""Reserved Seat"" and ""Inu-Yasha"" so much as well), which makes this movie a definite ""must-see!"""
4,A more flexible ankle than other toddler snow boots,"We ordered these boots after a few others we'd tried turned out to be too stiff for our kid to move his ankles. This seemed to make him off balance and made it hard for him to walk. I should note that our kid is a size between 5 and 6 and that his legs are probably shorter than average, which no doubt contributed to his lack of ease in the boots with stiff ankle straps. This boot has a relatively flexible upper with a zip front and elastic pull cord tightener around the top. The wool lining inside made them a bit stiff and it took awhile for him to get used to wearing them, but they were definitely more doable than the L.L. Bean boots we'd tried before. They also seemed to keep his tootsies fairly warm through a visit to friends in Vermont in snowy January. Trouble with snow getting into the boots can be remedied by pulling the pants leg of his snowsuit over the top of the boots -- a tight fit, but it worked."
3,Good product-need more!,"This is just what I wanted for my garden needs but I had a hard time ordering the quantity needed.When the three panels that I was allowed to order arrived, they were in good condition but each had partly broken through the packing boxes.For some reason, each panel was packed in a separate box.The finials had been wrapped with bubble warp but the the stake ends were not and they broke through the cardboard.It's a really good product but it has some distribution problems."
4,Nice Fencing,I had a few pieces of this from a discount overstock-type store. Liked the look but wanted one more piece to complete the section. Nicely made for the money.
3,A good decent comedy,"This movie was funny, I had a tainted opinion aswell as prior to watching it I read alot of reviews saying how bad it was. It's not half bad at all! You've got to remember this movie is now 15 years old, and although a typical comedy for the time it still has a lot of good laughs and a funny story line. Stallone's dream where he's in the diapers is just hilarous..."
1,Winner of Three Razzies!,"Sylvester Stallone had an alternate title for this sitcom drivel masquerading as a feature film: ""Dial M for Mother."" That alone is funnier than anything that happens in this truly embarrassing action-comedy. Everyone has seen better days, especially Roger Spottiswoode (who directed the 1983 political drama ""Under Fire""). In recent interviews, Stallone ranked ""Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot"" as his all-time worst movie. The competition must have been intense."
5,Stallone is the Ultimate Superstar!,"I can not tell you how much this movie has changed my life. Just when my life couldn't get any worse, I saw ""Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot"". Sylvester Stallone is the savior for mankind. When you think armageddon is upon us, just watch Stallone in this uplifting, spiritual movie. The relationship with his mother is unbelievable and touching. This motion picture deserves to be recognized and to be viewed by the world. Universal Pictures needs to release this movie on DVD, not for me, but for the human race."
4,cute movie,this movie has given a completely new face to mothers.this movie tells us that while mom's can be caring they can be tough too.
2,Where was I when they were handing out free shock therapy?,"Um, is it me, or did I just read two very very high thumbs up for this movie? I would rather have bamboo splinters rammed up under my fingernails with water dripping onto my forehead for 48 hours while sitting in a tiger cage than to see this movie again.Even Stallone was embarassed when the movie was released. I can recall David Letterman teasing Stallone on national tv for making this film. Stallone didn't even dare to defend the movie.Kids: Go to your room. You shouldn't be watching violent films anyway.Stallone fans: go see Cop Land, Get Carter, or Cliffhanger for a good time even Stallone would be proud of. Rocky anyone? Anyone?"
1,Do you have a minus ten rating?,By far the most chronic movie Sylvester Stallone has ever made . . . and he hasn't made that many good ones in the first place!
1,SLOW DELIVERY!,"I did not receive my dvd within the given time frame, which makes Amazon seems less reliable to me. Even though I did receive the product I wanted, I will never order from this seller again."
2,CAN MOM JUST SHOOT ME INSTEAD?,"I SWEAR, IF I HAVE TO WATCH JUST ONE MORE CHEESY MOVIE DEVISED AT MAKING A BUCK ON A FAMOUS NAME, I WILL SCREAM! ESTELL GETTY WAS JUST DOING A REVISAL OF HER GOLDEN GIRLS ROLE, AND SLY STALLONE, JUST DOESNT LOOK FUNNY ENOUGH TO BE BUT SO COMICAL..NOT TO MENTION, WHEN I SEE HIM, I SEE ROCKY..SORRY..AND ROCKY WAS, PUNCHY MAYBE, BUT NOT A COMEDIAN..I SEE RAMBO TOO..I LIKE SLY STALLONE'S BODY OF WORK, IN GENERAL, AND I THINK HE IS CAPABLE OF BEING FUNNY..I'VE SEEN HIM ON SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE AND HE WAS HYSTERICAL..SO I DONT GIVE UP HOPE..BUT THIS MOVIE ISNT WORTH MORE THAN FIVE BUCKS TOPS.. IF YOU ARE JUST DYING TO SEE STALLONE, GO GET ROCKY AND RELIVE YOUR YOUTH..OR, GO GET ROCKY v, AND RELIVE YOUR MIDDLE AGE YEARS, OR JUST GET THE NEXT ROCKY MOVIE AND LIVE OUT YOUR GOLDEN YEARS..BUT WHATEVER YOU DO, DONT SHUCK OUT ANY CASH FOR THIS ONE,IT IS PROBABLY ON CABLE RIGHT NOW."
5,DVD,"this was a great movie. i have seen it before and loved it. it's old, but cute. the acting is pretty poor, but it was a great feel good movie."
2,Estelle Getty is the only advantage,"Seriously, Estelle Getty is the only one that brings comic relief throughout the movie. Plus, she knows how to act like a mother no one would ever stand. That's pretty much it. Getty's character is the only thing worth watching in this seemingly unwatchable comedy. Stallone fails to be funny here, and the jokes aren't really worth it. The action scenes aren't even that impressive, either, which makes me wonder if the cast and crew even cared. The plot did have many possibilities, but the end result brought the whole thing down to the bottomless pit. Aside from Getty, this movie doesn't do much to entertain. I'd say skip it and watch a better comedy."
3,Average Funny Movie that many sons will identify with,"I remember seeing this film in the theaters with my mother. This is a pretty corney movie about an LA police officer who's mother comes to visit and get's caught up in a large police investigation. She is Overbearing, Intrusive, but has a big heart and has her son's best interest in mind. As for a production, not really good, Stallone's performance is flat, Getty does a decent job, but overall worth a viewing."
2,Unfunny Comedy A Childish Stallone performance,"After the colossal flop of ""0SCAR"" Sly Stallone didn't fare much better in this sophmore efoort ""STOP! OR MY MOM WILL SHOOT"" Stallone plays a burned out cop who can't seem to keep a woman has the burden of putting up with his nosey mother when she makes a surprise visit. Stallone's testosterone was raging out of control here when he should of added more humor to it, insted of using the usual cliches that comes along with films like this. Estelle Getty from the t.v sereis GOLDEN GIRLS puts in a genuine funny effort and may have saved the film if it had a better script. Sylvester Stallone isn't one for comedy. And if you see this film you'll know why. ROCKY anyone?"
5,"unknown, one of the most perfect films ever made","This humble flick is structured like a string quartet -- in fact, Sherwood's production company was called Rondo, and the film uses the musical metaphor throughout. Crisp performances, a fast and witty script, remarkable and agile pacing, a brilliant party scene that forms the structural center -- this is probably one of the most perfect small films ever made, one that deals with AIDS without the garish sentimentality of Philadelphia or Love, Valor, Compassion. Steve Buscemi is super as the wise cracking Nick in his first film role. Never have I seen a more skilled balance of humor and seriousness, served seemingly without effort in the guise of a light comedy. Every filmmaker should see this."
4,"The Flood, a good read","This book is a good one for Christians and Non-Christians to read because it brings to light that there are some scientists and archaeologists who accurately prove that the Bible is true in its presentation of ""The Flood"" and the period of time it took place. It also points out why and how most scientists and archaeologists don't want to admit they are wrong in not believing it and use false information in their responses to their finds. A must read if you want to know more about the flood and its importance to understanding what the Bible says about that period of time."
5,REALLY A GREAT READ ABOUT THE FLOOD,"I read this book several years ago. Bought it at a used book store for $7. Was not sure just what kind of book it was, till I started to read it....and LOVED it...Easier read than THE GENESIS FLOOD by John Witcomb, which IS a great book too, but more scientific. This one really paints word pictures so well, and makes you want to check out the wonders reviewed in this book. Some day!!!! Meanwhile I plan to read it again, but on my KINDLE! Thank you Amazon, for a Kindle version!"
1,"Should just be ""In the Light of the Bible""","This is a religious book, not a science book. Does not answer even the most obvious questions regarding a great flood theory. Why is evidence of early humans only found near the earth's surface? Why are fossils found stratified rather than jumbled up as if deposited by a flood? Did the author really go to a quarry, canyon, or cliff and look? His explanation is that all the big animals ran to the top of the hills! Apparently this book is still being published, but its bias and lack of rigor are obvious. But Christians don't have to abandon their faith to accept modern evidence. Many books such as ""Saving Darwin - How to Be a Christian and Believe in Evolution"" by Karl W. Giberson are rationale as well as spiritually inspiring."
5,Maybe The Greatest Christmas Book,"This book is a wonderful christmas book, perhaps the most wonderful christmas book there is.If you want a real christmas mood book, one that should really help you get into the spirit of the season, then look no further.The wonderful pictures capture christmas and it's many displays throughout America. This is a very warm christmas book, one that is perfect for the coffee table for you and any visiting friends and family to enjoy over the christmas holidays.Especially makes a great gift for those who like christmas displays.I can't say enough great things about this book. Well, except for........ just get it!!!!!!!"
3,Watch the baby's head,"I actually ended up taking this back to the store. You couldn't put the bar back on the carrier to take the baby out with this attatched or it would smack them in the head...and it's not soft. It's probably not so bad if you have a small baby, but my son was 8 lb 8 oz. and 22 in. I opted for the Take Along Arch by Tiny Love instead. My son loved it and the toys were soft to chew on."
3,Fun but DANGEROUS!,The first time I put this toy bar on my daughters car seat she didn't really get it. I took it off and tried a few weeks later when she was about 3 months old. I noticed that the bigger she got the closer the center piece got when it was spun around. The top of the center toy is sharp and when spun can hit your child in the face and scratch them. My daughter loves to play with this toy but I think the manufacturer could make some safety improvements such as NOT PUTTING SHARP CORNERS ON THE TOP OF A SPINNING TOY!! I do not put this bar on her car seat all of the time but when she gets bored with her other toys I put it up and she gets extremely excited. I suggest supervision while this toy is being used.
4,Best Pal for my Girl,"My baby is 4 month old and we got this for her when she was 2 month old. It became her best friend in the car in no time. she always cooing to it. The bright color and flashing lights really keeps her interested. And after she look at it for 3 weeks, she grabbed it with both of her hands. That was the first time she play with a toy. We love to see her happy and this toy brings smile on her face everytime."
2,Make sure it WORKS before you leave store,"I got this for my baby shower. The buttons never worked though. And there is no batteries to change so I had to take it back. I decided not to exchange it for another, just in case the batteries die too soon or something. Made me weary. Also when I tested another one, they sounds it makes are pretty annoying. I decided to buy the Lamaze Link A long friends instead and Just LOVE them."
1,Problems with Painted Toys,"Have any of you experienced problems with the paint rubbing off on this product? If so, please let me know at tali@iwon.com."
2,it gets warm,It gets takes about 10 minutes to get medium warm even when it is set at the highest temperature setting. It never gets hot. I think that it has some sort of timer limitation because it seems to cool off after 20 minutes or so even if I leave it at the highest temperature setting.
4,Great product.,"Most heating pads I found to be too small for what I need. This larger size is perfect and I can't live without it. My doctor recommends moist heat and this worked great.The only drawback for me is the auto-off feature. It turns off in 1 hour and I usually need it for longer but I guess that safety feature outweighs the inconvenience of turning it back on.Also, the high setting doesn't get any hotter than the medium setting so instead of 4 heat settings, you are really only getting 3. Again, probably a safety feature but I would like it a little hotter."
5,Moist/Dry heating pad,"Very nice quality, dependable, delivers even heat and control panel easy to operate. Would recommend this product."
1,fire hazard,"I had this item for about 6 months, using it for a stiff back and shoulders. The automatic shut off failed (or something else went wrong) and the electrical housing started to melt. Fortunately I was next to it and smelled the wires burning and was able to unplug it. By this time the heating pad and switch were too hot to touch. It really freaks me out knowing this thing could have burned down my house if I hadnt been paying attention. BUYER BEWARE!"
1,heating pad is stiff and doesn't conform to your body,"I bought this heating pad for my neck and shoulders, and it is terrible. It is so stiff that it won't wrap around my neck and shoulders. It's like trying to wrap a piece of cardboard around you. I thought that with the ties, it would be ok, but it's not. Don't buy this if you need it to form to your body."
4,Excellent quality,"I thought the automatic shutoff would be good. However, it shuts off too soon and I have to keep turning it back on. Would be great for old folks or medical purposes. As a bed warmer would prefer something else"
2,Older Model is Better,"I bought this after giving my older model to a family member...and I'm not impressed because it doesn't get as hot as my older model did and as a result doesn't provide me the relief that I need. I like the simple, and easy to use design but I am probably going to end up returning it because it doesn't get half as warm as my older model, even on the highest setting."
1,Automatically shuts off after 1 hour,"The write-up on this SoftHeat Plus heating pad makes no mention of a ""New"" feature that automatically shuts the pad off after 1 hour. I specifically wanted one that did NOT have an auto-shutoff timer. Damn!Back it goes."
1,Did not work,Bought this product at a store. It did not work and the store will not take it back. This is a horrible product avoid at all cost!
4,Works great,"This heating pad has four settings and I can usually put it at setting 2 or 3 and have a comfortable level of heat. It does have an auto-shut off, which is for safety, so I dont mind the inconvenience of having to press the button again every now and then."
2,Very unhappy with this basic translator,"I found a translator that is 10,000 times better then this one. I have returned this translator to Amazon"
3,Can this product translate French into English?,"I would like to know ablut the ability of this electronic dictionary. Can this product translate French into English and vice versa? And can this do German into english and vice verse? If this can do that, I would like to order this product. If not, let me know another product which can do that, please. If possibly, I would like to be recommended a product that can traslate French, German into English and vice verse."
1,looking for persian electronic dictionaries,"The electronic device is very nice, but I was looking for Persian electronic dictionaries."
2,Difficult to watch but it IS Donovan. For fans only.,"This one did not age well. It's very poorly paced and so predictable it's difficult to watch. For collectors only, or people who want to see what you could get away with filming back in the day."
2,CHEAP LOOKING JUNK,"A g (!) rated variation of THE DEVILS and MARK OF THE DEVIL, with WILLARD also thrown in---all 1970s movies.very lackluster direction, almost amateurish look to this thing...a number of hammer horror movies are better.and donovan by this time was burnt out; no worthwhile music here from 1960s drippy hippy."
1,Only for die-hard Donovan fans,"The year is 1349, and the people of Hamelin are building a cathedral in hopes of warding off the Plague. The Burgermeister is happily planning the marriage of his daughter to the Barron's son (John Hurt), and a band of actors and a piper (Donovan) come to town.I expected this 1972, Donovan movie to be a hippy-dippy, rock fairy tale, but I was way off. It's dreary and pointless, with a completely forgettable script and soundtrack. The film focuses on the Burgermeister's money problems, and the Piper story is almost an afterthought; his piping-the-children-away doesn't even merit a comment.Donovan has no discernible acting talent or screen presence, mostly plays a modern guitar, and is a minor character. Top-billed Jack Wild, so likable in ""Oliver!"" plays a disabled apprentice, but he is well-past his boyish-prime and adds nothing to the story. Both children and adults will probably be bored by this cheap misfire."
4,Delightful read,"This is a wonderful story of spirit and adventure. It's a delightful read for a curious child, especially one of Irish heritage, since Fiona's story is a story like so many who left Ireland. We enjoyed it tremendously."
4,Sic Wid It keeps it real!,"The two Vallejo rappers are not the most scilled ones, but with a good prodution (executive producer E-40)... THE BEATS ARE GOOD."
5,"True male-male romance, best I've ever read...","There's plenty of reviews for this book, most pretty good, and I don't know that mine will make much difference, but I just had to leave my thoughts on this story, because it affected me so much.I'm pretty new to this genre, but have read some very good material ('Faith and Fidelity' by Tere Michaels, 'Rough Canvas' by Joey W. Hill, among others). The lure is, I suspect, the same for all of us fans: the complexities of men behaving like men, in a same-sex romantic setting. Love is difficult enough between the two sexes, with our inherent differences. How much more complicated can it get when it's between men who share the same lack of communication skills and excess of testosterone?If you like your male-male romance to happen between true, grown-up men, this story is for you. Enjoy!!"
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed with this novel. The characters engaged way too early in the book.I found myself confused about which character was which because of how fast the author had the characters involved with each other. It was difficult to care about the two leads and I ended up putting the book down and not finishing it at all. Perhaps I will pick it up again some day but for now- I cannot care enough about the characters or story to finish the book.
3,A Mixed bag,"I love cowboys and hot gay sex. However, this is a novel torn between a love story with a plot and a porn novel. It never really reaches either point. The plot is pretty flat and gets lost between the sex and the sex isn't raunchy enough to be flat out porn. I would have wished for a more complex story with a few good hot love scenes than what is presented. I would love a story on par with Brokeback Mountain with its emotional range and feeling that has some good sex in it."
1,Get Real,"This story had so many opportunities to be a great story. That being said, I have to agree with some of the other reviewers, there was entirely too much sex. If I wanted sex, I can get that in some trashy magazine but I read these stories for the romance and the ""happily ever after.""The one thing that bothered me the most was, and not in just this story but others as well, is the infidelity. I read these stories to escape from real life for a time. These situations leave a bitter taste in my mouth. Maybe it's because I've been through that. It's NOT what I want to read about. Real life has its own problems. When I read this, I can't get my reaction out of my head and when the story ends with the two making up and forgetting all the past, it makes me think, ""get real."""
5,perfect erotic love that goes beyond the happily ever after,"this was probably my favorite gay book. It had everything that matter in a love story. also i loved how it was devoted to how they fell in love, but also the thing that goes beyond falling in love and living together as a couple that books never tend to show. great book recommend it for everyone, (and not just because of the HOT SEX SCENES) it really is a terrific story."
2,really?,"For the first half of the book, i would say was all about sex! I got tired of it, i thought i had bought a porn book (if that exists) i was really bored and had to shuffle through the pages, it felt that every other page was about sex, the last part of the book, the actual story was OK, not what i expected of the writer... sorry but if i wanted a porno i would of rented one!"
4,Best available,I'm really enjoying the Rio; use a different headset though for better sound. Only real negative is that it doesnt support NT....but then I dont think any MP3 players do....I am very satisfied!
1,Bad product,I bought this last year and it was working fine for about 6 month. Then it suddenly froze and didn't react to anything. I spend several days trying to fix it. I downloaded a program from the website that is supposed to fix that problem. It turned out to be useless. Of course they do not have a tech support you can call. So after a lot of e-mails I was allowed to return the product and got it back after 3 weeks. It was fine for about 2 month and then the same thing happened. In summary this is a bad product manufactured by a terrible company with bad tech support. Don't make the mistake to buy it.
3,Two essays on why Mary is important to a Catholic,"This book contains two spiritual essays on the relationship between Jesus and Mary and its relevance to a Catholic, written in Nouwen's characteristic spiritual, yet simple, style. If you are a Catholic who has grown up within the culture of Mary, this book will be a helpful little guide that helps to understand your faith in Mary in a new light. Nouuwen touches on a fundamental longing within each human being to get in touch with one's ""inner child"", and Mary's divine maternity is the bond that assists this process. However, if you are a Catholic or Christian who is trying to understand the relationship between Jesus and Mary and wondering why we should have a relationship with Mary at all, then Nouwen's book is not helpful. Unlike Nouwen's other books, this does not delve in to the issue at hand and examine the many aspects that affect believers."
1,"One ""Howl"" of Movie","If you believe wolves can get under the hood of an automobile, tear it apart, AND steal a cellphone, BUT cannot hear a 185-lb. man climbing down a rickety ladder from an upstairs window, then THIS is your movie. It's so bad, it actually almost defies description. There is no character development, no kind of story that would interest anyone, zilch. What there is is the wussiest main character I've seen in quite a long time (so much to point that I just wanted to kick him until he was dead) and his ""teenage"" pals who make one stupid decision after another.On the other hand, the wolves (although I think they might have been hybrids of some sort) are beautiful.Skip it."
3,Josh Kelly from OLTL!,This movie was okay. It was okay because the fourth wheel actually was a Godsend. All would be killed if not for his brains and bravery.
2,My 1st. comment,"Just received the book yesterday. Hardly used for one night & the pages starts coming out! Such a terrible binding! Apart from this, I can't comment on the content of the book itself yet but I am sure I made the right decision in purchasing this book after all those recommendations by others.To ""improbability press"" - please improve your book binding technique!"
2,My 1st. comment!,"Just received the book yesterday and have been browsing thro' for just a night & lot of the pages starts coming off!!

3,2x4 Furniture is just ok.,"This book is ok. Some of the projects are good, but most in my opinion are dated and not very attractive. I would never pay full price for this, but if you can find it at a significant discount as I did, it is worth the money."
2,"Furniture made with 2X4s, I think not!","The majority of projects in this book DO NOT involve the use of 2X4s. Most involve 1X and 2X materials. If you're looking for creative uses for 2X4 stud material, then keep looking. You'll only find about 3 plans in this book that use 2X4s to some extent."
3,Interesting projects,"This book has some nice projects, but don't let the name fool you. There isn't one 2x4 used on any of the furniture pieces."
5,Good purchase,"Clean, well-cared for book, and an excellent price. Can't ask for more than that! Will be shopping here in the future. Thanks."
1,Not the best,hardly any projects require just 2x4's which is why I bought this. Better off using online guides as this book has so many useless projects its not worth the shipping cost.
5,Good book,Good book. This is a replacement copy for one that was lost. I have made a couple of things from this book. It's easy to use.
5,This is the only Yosemite Big Wall guidebook you'll need,Yosemite's best in painstaking detail -- a truly outstnading resource !
2,Franklin MWD-1440,"Product appeared to be well used or abused. Batteries ran down very quickly. Was very careful with sticky on/off button. No instructions. Not previous owners fault. Using my own German/English bookman, could not figure out how to use it. Again: Batteries ran down very quickly. Luck of the draw, I guess. Not happy! LOOKING FOR MODEL DBD-2015. Anybody have one?"
5,Enciclopedia,"Apart from MWD - 1440 I have a couple of more Franklin products and especially the Dictionary with the Columbia Enciclopedia option on the back of it. I have been using it constatly for the past five years as it has been extremely useful for all my subjects and basically for everything related to general knowledge. As I'm doing some foreign languages, I would also like to get hold of some more discs insertable on the back, but I find it really hard to find them here in London. . ."
1,Are the add-on modules as good as the built in ones?,I read through the reviews and noticed the one from Montreal in which the user identified a problem. She found the module program for French-English was not as good as the built in one. So I'm wondering if the Franklin MWD-1440 Dictionary and Thesaurus with Bookman II has better software than I would get if I bought the dictionary add-on for the DBE 1440 Spanish-English translator I own?
3,Not very bright dictionary,"I recently read a review by dave lester concerning a Seiko dictionary. In it he explained that he uses that product like I intended to use the Franklin. I use it while reading and every time I come across a new word I like to quickly look it up. In to many cases, I find that the product is just not up to the task. If more time were spent for just the dictionary and less for games etc., you would have a much better product."
4,Holly-Needs a bit of work,"This tool makes the drudgery of learning new words for a moody 13 year old, more bearable, even fun. The student can input their words into a wordlist for the week and spend that week playing games such as hangman and others, while reinforcing learning to spell each word. It is especially helpful that once the words are input, getting the definitions is a snap. Also, I have caught her just looking up definitions for fun, because it is so easy, can't hurt!"
2,"It was ok, I guess","I got this bookman in August. I hoped it would cut back on my hamework. It did for a while. I had it for 2 months in a package. I finally opened the bookman, and used it for about 2 or 3 months, and soon the screen cracked. I wanted to turn it in because of the warenty, but they said it would cost $30 to replace the screen! THe system was still under warenty! other than this little/ huge flaw, it is a good machine."
2,Disappointed,I must say that after all the great reviews I was a little let down by the Franklin Electronic Dictionary.I bought it so that I could read in bed and check out all those new words without having to lug around my very heavy dictionary.Of the first 20 or so words I keyed in approximately 12 were not in there.Since then this has been quite a regular pattern.I found the games either too simple or that they too often used proper names. So it is back to the book for this boy until a better version is offered.Perhaps electronics aren't taking over the world after all!
5,very handy,I bought the MWD-1440 some time ago and I find it very useful for quick lookup of words as well as thesarus entries. I can store a short wordlist of the words i didnt know and view them as flash cards too! Its a great buy.
3,Funny but not overly developed.,"This satire of war and love captures your interest, but its small size leaves it unable to develop a substantial plot nor arrive at a climactic ending."
2,Arms and the Man,"The book I am going to talk about is the book Arms and the Man By Bernard Shaw. I really did not like this book because it was hard for me to understand. The reason I didn't like it was because it was challenging for me. The English was hard to understand. I liked how the writer wrote the book and I would probably look for another one of his books. This book was more like an opera with out music. If I could have and known to I probably would not have this enthusiastic about the book. One reason I picked the book was because it was dealing with war and I thought it would have been cool to read about war, but when I got more in to the book it was really not about war it was more about a love at war. If you're an older audience it would be a good book, or if you're looking for a good love-war story."
2,"George Bernard Shaw and ""Arms""","Community Playhouse in Long Beach did the show this August. As it played, the plot didn't come through, but the wit of Shaw did. The playhouse didn't have the costumes of the military men, nor the actors to carry-off the pomp and bravado of these would-be heroes. In a time when G.W. Bush is fighting his own phantasmic enemies this play should have lapooned the whole spectre of military madness. George Bernard Shaw gave us the theme it will take some imagination and talent to make it contemporary and equal to the madness of our times. Anon"
4,Caught in Atlanta,"This is a wonderful story based on the true life of a young girl. The author has taken Sallie Clayton's diary and turned it into an account of life before, during, and after the Civil War.The only problem is the long footnotes. Some of these notes take up most of the page and tell boring historical information. Sometimes, it helps set up the plot. At other times, it's annoying and makes me want to throw the book against the wall...I say you should read this book if you want to look inside the life of a Civil War woman, or if you just want to learn more about life during the Civil War...either way, it's a wonderful book."
3,Another humdrum Thompson adventure,"I was very excited when as a child I learned Jack Pumpkinhead had his own book, but it was almost fifteen years later that I finally got to read it and it was definitely a disappointment.The good things that can be said about the book are few, such as it doesn't follow the Thompson formula for turning old people,dolls, inanimate objects etc. into a young prince or princess....well, not exactly anyway, but I won't spoil that.Belfaygor is likeable at some times and annoying others, and except for his beard he's forgettable.Ozma is shown once again to not be the most competent ruler and her subjects don't make things any better.A good Oz book this is not, but it's still got it's moments and I can't dislike it completely."
1,WHY?,"Why release these? These episodes have already been released once, some even twice! We could have Galactic Battles instead of wasting time on repeats!"
3,It's not what i expected,The pegs where a little longer then most... it can be good or bad depending it's easier to grab but takes up more space so it's all down to what you need.
3,Not as good as it used to be,"I have used SW for years in LE and outdoors. The new knife is made cheaper, out of country, printed that way and has a different handle than the original one ive had for ten years. The new knife isn't bad, just not as good as my other, and for the cost I could have gotten a better blade from another company. No problems with amazon. my complaint is with SW. You have multi billion business worldwide. U want to sell the best stuff, stop making it cheaper and start making it better. My old knife goes with me everyday. The new one now sits on the dresser. If this is the start of SW having a cheaper production process I will start looking into other products. I hear Glock makes a pretty good gun."
1,Warning: don't purchase this costume from Costumehub.com,"We were so excited about ordering this costume. We ordered from costumehub.com and they did not include the hat shown in the photo. They include a piece of felt you put on your head - and it makes the kid look like Napolean, not a patriot. If you order this costume call ahead and make sure you will receive the real tricorner hat, not a piece of black felt with a gold dot on it that you could make yourself for 50 cents."
3,kids patriot costume,"Item was exactly as stated, runs very small, ordered a large 12-14 for my 9 year old and it fit well."
3,Not as well made as expected,I expected this costume to be more than one piece. The hat is also too small and my son has a regular head size for a 10 year old.
3,Very Small and Not well made,"I needed to purchase this for my son's 4th grade grade class trip to a colonial village. The sizes do run very small. The pants were split when I received it but there was no time to exchange it. By the time my son got to school, a button had fallen off. Very poor quality."
2,Colonial costume,I must admit that I am a little disappointed in this costume. It is CHEAPLY made and the hat (the one pictured) is not included! The manufactures include a felt hat instead and it is triangular shaped and doesn't fit on a 9 year old's head because it is too small! I am not happy with this purchase.
3,The usual Halloween costume quality,Don't expect too much from this. It's made of thin polyester material that is common for most Halloween costumes. Size large fit my 6th grader then.
4,DC Never Changes,"This book kept my interest from start to finish. It is written on an adult level, reminiscent of an era when DC was still mysterious.I'm a resident of DC, and this book reminds me of the Jimmy Stewart movie ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" not for the story line, but because even though this story was set decades ago, written decades ago, it could have been written today. DC absolutely never changes.Read this book for a higher-level ""West Wing"" from the congressional side. Drugs, sex, affairs, power -- its all in there.I recommend this book on the inside of DC -- and it is enjoyable for all -- Democrats and Republicans aren't mentioned, so it doesn't matter your party!Enjoy."
2,Politically enjoyable- otherwise a disappointment.,"I bought this book expecting to read a historical, political novel. I quickly realized that the politics of the novel only made up about 1/4 of the story. The other 3/4 were used to describe the love affairs of the characters. The political side of this book was first rate, however I was extremely disappointed to find that Mr. Vidal wasted much of his book on irrelevent and uninteresting (not to mention discusting) details that I would have rathered NOT Knowing."
1,NOT SURE OF WHAT IS GOING ON.,"ORDER THIS DEC 13, 2006 FOUND OUT LATE JAN IT HAD NOT BEEN DELIVERED AMD WROTE TO THE COMPANY BUT HAVE NOT HEARD A WORD ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE DOING WITH THE ORDER . ARE THEY JUST GOING TO KEEP MY MONEY OR DELIVER THE WARE????????? NO COMMUNICATION!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Decent Chi Masala at a Good Price,"I drink several 16 oz cups of chai each day. I like masalas that have black pepper and ginger as the first two ingredients (which Badshah has). Although I normally use Laxmi Tea Massala which has a more robust flavor, it costs nearly twice as much, so I am happy with the Badshah."
1,Cheap keychain at an inflated cost....................,"If you want to be charged big bucks for a cheap keychain....this is the place to shop. You'd do better to plunk down $7.00 at a county fair this summer and try to win something.....at least you'll have more fun and you won't have this dealer tell you...'I have your money........ so I won't lose sleep over the deal""....."
3,"Not good, not bad","Don't overlook the fact that this guy comes without a remote control like I did. When playing back some Video CD's (VCD's) it occassionaly skips about a quarter second of sound - the same VCD played on a Panasonic DVD player handles the same disk just fine.The microphones are good enough for most karaoke users. The echo adjustment is plenty large enough. Jumping to a higher track number is a bit difficult but can be done.Having two video and stereo pair outputs are nice, not having an RF to connect to a smaller televsion set isn't."
1,What a Bust!,Bought this player and the key changer is so off the player also opens when it wants to.... Never buy again from Audiostream
2,A Night in the Life,"After hearing a couple reviews from friends in person, as well as the enthusiastic applause it received from the readers here, I expected quite a bit more from 'Clan Novel: Toreador' than I received from the first of the 13-book series. Not that it was a bad book, or that it occupied countless volumes of my time. Rather, it was an easy read, one that went by quickly but did not leave many lingering afterthoughts in its wake.As would be the fashion, bits and pieces of this book are to be incorporated in the following 12, each overlapping a small amount. I initially ordered the first six of the series and intend to read through them; I hope that the intrigue grows, or even, appears. Like other books of a series, though, I'm hoping this is just a lead-in to much better material."
2,Weak and over advertised.,"The story in and of itself is somewhat interesting, yet it's nothing to really look forward to. It's fairly basic, showing most of what Kindred do, not just Toreador. The other downside of the book, is the length. It's so short that nothing really goes into much depth, and you get a little overview of everything, but never get into anything. It's a good book if you're bored and have nothing else to do."
1,Horrible!,"I used to play Vampire the Masquerade, and when I found out about these books I was ecstatic. Wow! was I dissapointed when I read this book. The whole point of the rpg is character development, which this book had none of! The characters were weak to say the least. I found my mind wandering throughout this book, it did not hold my attention at all! I am sure any rpg gamer will agree with me that this book was lacking in many ways. I am afraid to even attempt to read the others!"
2,Poor characters saying poor dialog,"Basically it's a book to set up the 12-book plot. Only a very few of the mainly peripheral characters are interesting. If you're looking for a better White Wolf vampire novel, try the Masquerade of the Red Death trilogy. I'll admit that there were some good scenes though, but for what was told it should have been cut down to a short story. I'm just hoping the series gets better."
2,Not quite up to mediocre.,"If you enjoy the Vampire roleplaying game, and don't object overmuch to a book that is sloppily written and edited, and that has no real ending (granted, to give it its due, it at least doesn't end on a cliffhanger, as so many ""series"" books do these days; the end just sort of trails off, but it doesn't really give a feeling of completion) you might enjoy this book. The characters aren't bad, and the plot is tolerable. But great literature this certainly is not, nor even especially good genre fiction. An okay quick read, nothing more."
5,Great Story...,I loved the story. The Toreador as they were meant to be seen. The writing was so so in places. But the overal plot makes up for it. An extremly easy read I recommend to anyone.
1,Yuck.,"Poorly written erotica, including a scene of deadly penis flagellation, and lots and lots of annoying expository text are what Vampire fans have to look forward to in the first of the thirteen clan novel series. If you want to experience this novel without actually paying five bucks, flare your nostrils, pick up a screwdriver and stab at your brain until you no longer have any cognative abilities. Congratulations!"
1,Deader than a staked vampire.,"There is only one word I have to describe this book...boring. It was slow right from the beginning. Every single character in the book is 2 dimensional and under developed. The author had a concept when he wrote this book and the concept was sterotype. There is so little development in both story and characters that it staggers the mind. I am hoping that the second book will be much better. Most rpg adaptaions are not very good, and this author didn't want to break that tradition it seems. A pity as the Toreador are a very interesting clan. If you are a die hard vampire fan then give it a read, if not pick up something else."
2,One of the hardest books to get through...,"that I have ever read.I would have to agree with a few select reviewers on this book. It was very hard to get through. Character development was absolutely horrible. I couldn't connect with anyone in the book.I gave it two stars because it sets the scene for the following book. Not character wise, but locationally (locationality?). It gives you the hierarchy system.But as a roleplayer I know that they could have done much better. Especially after reading the clan books they put out for the game. My opinion is simply that they should have stuck to short stories perhaps, those aren't bad.I don't recommend this book unless you are interested in reading through the entire series. Because I know a few people that just wanted to read them for thier prefered clans (I'm a Gangrel fan myself).The rest of the books are worth reading, they get smoother and more interesting as you go down the line. This one just wasn't really worth my time."
2,Getting through it is required...,"Well, quite frankly, this novel wasn't very readable. It does its job of setting up the rest of the series adequately. That's about it. The other novels in the series are all superior to this one. One just had to set everything up, and this one drew the short stick. You have to read this one in order to understand the series of events, though, so this is a must read if you want to read the rest. Just get through it, and I promise the rest of the series picks up tremendously."
2,What were they thinking?,"I put in the DVD to watch with my kids (4 and 7), and before we knew it... there were these very scary previews of other shows. The worst was the preview for American Gothic. I couldn't believe that they would put this preview on a collection that I would consider to be G rated. I couldn't fast forward through them either... don't know if that is my player or the format. It sort of put a damper on the whole happy vintage tv watching evening."
1,Totally inappropriate trailers,"Leave It To Beaver is in my top 3 favorite television programs of all time - so I was exited to be able to buy the whole first season in one set.However, and this is a huge however, Universal stuck some highly offensive ads for other television collections and movies on the front.Provocative television programs and Brokeback Mountain with Leave It To Beaver? Who in this perverted world makes decisions like these?After just receiving it in the mail from Amazon, I put it on for my grandsons to watch. Their dvd player doesn't have a remote or a menu option, so I couldn't skip the ads. I finally just turned it off.I dearly love Leave It To Beaver, but this set violates the very essence of the show.I do NOT recommend this set."
3,"Great series, Bad product",The TV programs are great. However that was constantly interupted by the programs freezing and stoping. I returned the first copy and the same problem existed with the second copy. The studio needs to get a new comapny to press the discs and create a better hard product. The soft product is the best.
1,Family Favourites Four Movie Collection,The purchase of this Christmas present has been a nightmare. I am based in NZ and was completely unaware that DVD's had 'zones' . We have played this DVD on our new Mac lap top over Christmas with disasterous effects. We can no longer play 'NZ' DVDs on our laptop as it just locks up. While I like the content of the DVD - I would never have purchased this if I knew how incompatible this was with NZ programmes. Was this something that was explained for non - USA purchasers and I missed the warning? Our system will no longer play any DVD's which is extremely upsetting as we travel regularly and rely on that system to entertain our kids.
5,one decision put on hold,"What's not to like about Leave It To Beaver? A tiny regret for this collection and its companion season two for me is seeing it on saleand NOT buying it. I was watching my pennies around the Thanksgiving holiday when I am sure I saw it at Target for 14.99. And of course, Target is famous for carrying product a short while and then you never see it again. Now Leave It To Beaver is priced at 37.99 and I can't understand why. It is after all a 50 year+ television show. I think perhaps a warehouse filled with DVDs went up in flames somewhere. But if you are made of money...this series is well worth every penny."
5,"Family Favorites Flipper, Little Rascales, Beaver, Casper",Brought many good enjoyable hours to our family while watching these movies. It brought memories of my younger days forward & gave me a time to share them with my grandchildren. What a blessing. I recommend it to anyone who desire a great movie to spend good holsome hours & share with the younger ones in your life.
5,GREAT SHOW! WHERE ARE THE REST OF THE SEASONS?,This is one of the best shows ever! Please finish what you started and release the rest of the seasons. I bought this and season 2 and it has been way too long a wait for the next season. What are you waiting for??
3,Stick with the basics,"I recommend purchasing the standard set, not the ""limited edition"" collectors version. The lunch box is cool enough, but the DVDs are housed in a cheap plastic ""photo album"", which will, no doubt, yellow with age (looks like PVC, which is notorious for aging). The ""photo album"" doesn't stand up buy itself and doesn't physically ""fit in"" very well with a DVD collection. Would have been much better if they had just put the standard boxed set in the lunchbox. (There is also a large piece of styrofoam in the lunchbox. Classy.) The DVDs themselves are excellent and any LITB fan will be thrilled."
3,Five stars for the show...one star for the DVD,"It's frustrating to review this dvd set because I love the show so much, but Universal continues to put out the crappiest product and it's infuriating. ""Leave it to Beaver"" is classic television and it's great fun to rewatch these episodes without commercials, the problem is, I'd like to be able to see ALL of them. Besides the annoying two sided disks, my set has at least five episodes that freeze up and when they do, there's nothing whatsoever I can do to finish watching the episode. So let the buyer beware...buy the disks and hope you don't have the freezing problem or just continue to watch Beaver on TV Land."
1,Crap !,"Don't get this. What the details don't tell you is that the first disc that contains Little Rascals and Casper is a flipper/double sided disc. Which doesn't make sense. Universal has several other sets with four movies, movies which last shorter than the films in this set, but those sets don't have double sided discs. Shame on you, Universal, for giving us this inferior dvd set. If I had known there was a flipper disc in this set, I would've just bought the individual dvds of Little Rascals and Casper, and forgotten about Flipper and Leave It To Beaver, which I didn't want in the first place. I only bought this because it was cheaper than the individual dvds of Rascals and Casper. I guess this will teach me to do more research next time."
1,Wait and see...,"I've been waiting months for this DVD set of the first season of Leave it to Beaver to be released. Now that there is only one week to go I'm a little apprehensive about buying it so fast. I've bought other TV series on DVD and was pleased with what I saw. Will the same be true for this set?For one thing, the discs are going to be double-sided. I have never seen this on other series I have bought in the past. Movies, yes but TV series no. I have to wonder if the quality is going to suffer because of it.A bigger question: Since the discs are double-sided, does it mean they were trying to cut down on space? That might mean the episodes are cut.Sadly, if the episodes are cut I'll have to stick to watching the reruns on TV. Universal knows the series is popular, give the fans of it what they deserve, you know we'll buy it.Uncut, clear picture episodes are what I would like, extras would be even better!"
2,Cheaply made and lots of problems,"I was really disappointed in this package. Some of the episiodes play, some flutter and freeze, and some just won't play at all. I hate two-sided dvds and this one is just bad.When they DO play, the picture is really good. ( I never could get the haircut episode to play all the way though, and I tried it on two differents dvd players.)"
3,What's going on with the price?,"I purchased the Season One box set from Amazon in April 2006 for $24.97 and now they want $39.99 for it. What gives? I came here to see if Season Two has come down to what I paid for Season One, but it has gone up from about $35 to $44.99 since the last time I checked a couple months ago. Ouch! Like Eddie Haskell's bluster, I'm not buyin' it.I have had no problems with the two-sided disks, but occasionally green stripes appear on the edge of the TV screen for a few seconds (very obvious when watching a B&W; show). No big deal, just a little distracting. One star for price and five for performance, so I'll split the difference and give it a three."
4,Mildly pleased...,"Though the release of Leave it to Beaver was LONG over due. I am very disappointed in the poor choices the company made in the how the disks work. First, I can not search through the episode without it going straight to the end. Second, there is no closed captions. Third, the previews are horrid for children and on my cheap DVD player I can't fast forward through them. I can only suppose they thought they were selling to adults trying to relive their childhood. But I was trying to give my kids wholesome entertainment, which lacks in the modern programming. Although, I must confess, I didn't realize when I was younger how much the boys lied, and how uninvolved the parents were. And fourth, It came with no episode index on paper. I had to handwrite them out so we could know which episodes we wanted to watch. In all whoever put this package together did a very poor job in this DVD series, and I hope that the next season is better."
1,"Why Universal, Why?? 5 stars for the show 1 star for Universal","Why does Universal have to own the rights to all the really good stuff? The Munsters, the classic Monster films of the 30s and 40s, and now Leave it to Beaver. I agree with the previous reviewer -- Double sided discs are a pathetic excuse in this day and age, especially for a show that kids will undoubtedly be loading and unloading from the DVD player themselves. Just look at the recently released Adventures of Superman for an beautfiful example fo how a classic television show from the 50s should be released -- singlesided picture discs, commentaries, bonus features. I have been waiting for Leave it To Beaver on DVD for years and will obviously purchase it -- but with my teeth clenched in frustration over the cheapskates at Universal DVD."
2,Five stars minus money,"""Leave It to Beaver"" is a five star must have purchase package for all the many reasons cited in the above positive reviews. However, corporate greed by MCA Home Video executives entirely overrode all concepts of quality contol. Hey, I know the picture will never be perfect, but DVDs are almost always better than home copied videos. I object to the two sided DVD format! Disc One froze up right out of the box, even after running it through a DVD cleaner. The very fragile nature of this format practically guarantees future viewings will be worse, even with the most careful handling. Outch!! The good news is that the Amazon replacement service is fast, free, and rates a Five Star. So, order without fear. Maybe your copy will be the one good cop in a bad town."
4,Minnesota Charlie,"I watched the Beaver all the time when I was a kid. Now on those cold winter days I pop a CD in and watch Beaver, enjoy and reminisce a bit at the same time. The quality of the picture and sound is great. This is the first set I've owned with movies on both sides of disk and I not crazy about that but so far it seems to work just fine. I am glad I bought the set."
5,Makes me feel like a Dionyssian angel......,"More than anything, it was a feeling that Zarathustra inspired. This book effectively communicates that life is a song and a dance. That everything is goodness, and that it could never be any less. Even when Zarathustra walked through the valley of death it was merely a prelude to something greater. His shadow that he leaped over, that shadow that will always remain behind him....his friends and animals that were waiting at the cave. The fool at the city gate who warned of entering the city but did not leave himself. Move on, forward, upward....."
4,Unreadable ye's and thou's,"I hate to give Thus Spoke Zarathustra less than five stars in any form, but Common's translation is just unreadable. For a more readable (and better) translation use Kaufmann's version. Despite this, Zarathustra is Nietzsche's masterpiece and one of the greatest books of all time!"
2,No active table of contents,"This book has no active table of contents, making it good only if you wish to read it from cover to cover, and not browse."
2,Legendary Harley Davidson,I only found this item on Perfume Victoria seller at the purchase time. Glad for found and unhappy when the product arrived in a unsealed box. I was told the product condition was NEW and I tought that means sealed box otherwise I couldnt tell it was unused.Shippment was fast.
2,Fun Fun Fun....,"I bought this toy for my son at 6 months and a year later he still loves it. It is loud, but who's ever danced to the chicken dance softly? The major complaint I have is Elmo's neck broke after about 5 months, it just clicked everytime his head was suppose to circle.... After a little TLC and neck surgery Elmo's doing great!Buy this toy and have fun with your little one doing the chicken dance!"
1,Ready to stir-fry this bird,"Okay, it sounded like a fun idea. It seemed like the kids would have some innocent fun. It's been a week. I have already grown sick of chicken-dancing. The other day I accidently hit the button and he began dancing the chicken thing for the billionth time. I've already drop-kicked him into the woods behind our house but they found it and it continued to work. Folks, the 5 STARS I give this toy for durability is NOT A COMPLIMENT!!! Don't make this fowl mistake!"
2,Where is the volume button?,"My son adores Elmo, but he is deathly afraid of this one. It is WAY too loud and he is afraid to even go near it. Other than the dance, there isn't much else to this toy."
5,I danced my head OFF!,"This is a great toy, its fun and it even kept me occupied fer hours! Well maybe not hours...but it was fun and kids would love it! Buy it before it sells out! it is made out of a real nice fine feather fabric that makes it feel high qualityish."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"My 12 month old son received this toy as a birthday present and has always LOVED elmo. Soon after he played with this toy, he started to imitate Elmo's head movement. The reviews say that the head movement is adorable, but in fact it teaches kids to roll their head in a 360 degree movement. Needless to say, a 12 month old who has just started to walk is rolling his head all day and this causes him to fall and hurt himself!!!... This is a terrible toy for a new walker/runner!!!... Forget about buying it!!!"
3,Deafening,"I recently bought a chicken dance Elmo for my daughter, but it is too loud (and there is no way to adjust the volume). I actually really like Elmo and his songs but this is just earsplitting. Also, Elmo is not cuddly at all. His body is hard plastic with a thin ""fur"" covering."
1,Dont do it,"I got this thing with thoughts of how much fun the chicken dance is at weddings and oktoberfests. I realized my error about 1 day into it, think loud, obnoxious, horrible, want to throw it out the window...I'd suggest buying a quieter toy"
4,Fun... but not ALL that!,"My son got this for Christmas, and I am not sure why it was such the rage! My son thinks it is fun, but it has little educational value. It is a fun little toy, but not a favorite! My son gets so much more out of his wood puzzles, or dancing to his music CDs. If a gift or on sale, then a fun addition, but don't pay too much, as realize it's value is limited."
5,My Son Loves this toy,"My son really enjoys this toy. He plays with it all day long dancing with elmo. I have read other reviews about this toy breaking but I have not had the same experience. My son throws elmo, smashes him on the floor, drops him etc and our elmo is still going strong. This used to be his favorite toy until he got Touch my toes Pooh and that is a toy that I can not leave the house without. If chicken dance elmo is not your thing try that toy it is similar but a little less annoying."
4,Chicken Dance Elmo - Hard to find,"I was just trying to get my hands on one of these..They are going for approx 30.00 plus $10-12 s/h on ebay. I picked a couple up from here. What a deal. This is supposed to be the HOTTEST toy this season. I hope my little one is not disappointed. However, most kids get tired of the expensive toys and prefer to play with the tupperware or dads tools anyway."
5,"It Will Drive You Nuts, But Your Kid Will Love It!!!","My son actually loved this toy and we could not get it away from him. It is really cute until you hear the ""Chicken Dance"" a couple of hundred times! Elmo's character is so endearing that you will soon fall in love with it too!! Truthfully. it drove my husband crazy, but I loved it along wiht my son. He's a big Elmo fan!!"
4,Elmo is the coolest!,"Personally.. After hearing the song 10000 times, and not being able to get the tune out of my head... I would like to drop kick poor little Elmo though the goal posts of life..But if you are looking for the hit toy of the season which all kids will love, then go for it. As was said before in another review, its a toy for a child, not me.Be a hero this Christmas and get it!"
5,This is too cute,"I went to toys r us in search of the perfect gift for an 18 month old little girl. This elmo was right in sight I grabbed it for less than [expected] I tought how great, walking through the store I kept playing with it. Needless to say I went back and bought the last one for myself."
3,Scary Elmo???,"I bought this for my son for Christmas when he was ~ 5 months old and it completely scared him to tears! We felt so bad, and have a few times tried to bring it out for him since as he is now almost 12 months although it still terrifies him. I think it is a great toy, well made, cute, sings great songs, just recommend you buy it for children a little older :)"
4,"Very cute, but....","My 18 month old daughter adores Elmo, so of course we had to get this for her this past Christmas. It's very cute, very amusing, but it starts to wear on the parents nerves after a bit. Also, it's a little awkward and heavy for her age, since she wants to hug him, pick him up and carry him around. I prefer the talking Elmo doll that sings his theme song and is a bit more educational. It teaches words, numbers, colors, so it isn't as repititious as this one. Much easier on Mom and Dad's ears. :) This is a great toy, just not the best one to get if your little one loves Elmo!"
4,Entertaining Elmo!,"My 6-month old son received Elmo as a Christmas present. While it is not for his age group, he does enjoy watching Elmo bounce up and down and flap his arms. It is a good toy to distract him with while I am putting his laundry away or getting ready for his bath. It is pretty durable as well; my son has grabbed Elmo in mid-dance, but he is still going strong. If your are not a person that jumps to their feet when the Chicken Dance starts at a wedding reception, then, yes, this toy will annoy you. I personally think this toy is cute and enjoy entertaining my son by dancing along with Elmo. If you like the sound of children's laughter, then Elmo is a good buy."
2,#$@! Elmo,"My son saw this in the store and he liked it. I like the Chicken Dance, too, so we brought it home. After the first few days, it became ""Wakes You Up with Squaking at 2AM Elmo"". Shortly thereafter it became ""No Batteries Elmo"".I just couldn't take it anymore .The Squaking.....the squaking."
5,The best Elmo,"Para empezar yo soy una Coleccionista de los Muñecos de elmo, y este en especial me encanta, nada más nlo he visto en revistas porque no lo puedo comprar a qui en mi pais, no lo venden, pero si me dan la oportunidad, de comprarlo yo pago lo que sea, mi dirrección de correo es caritopresley@hotmail.com. Por favor solo mandenme información en español.( me com prometo a comprar por lo menos un muñeco al mes, dependiendo de las novedades puedo comprar más de uno )"
5,Good; as advertised,"Good product; as advertised. You will need help from IT if used inside a company network. It works well on other networks, but it will take some trouble shooting and reading the documentation. Follow the instructions."
2,New Slinbgbox is a downgrade!,"I ordered this device based upon good reviews of the first model. Installation went fine and the device works almost as expected. The problem is that Slingmedia, without notifying customers or potential costomers has downgraded functionality.The new devices (and the old models which incorporate new firmware) now utilize an encrypted stream. This breaks programs such as ""At Large Recorder"" which let me record my TV material for my review at a time of my choice.Since I travel abroad a lot, I have a great need to be able to place and time shift. Sitting in a hotel in Tokyo at 6:00p.m., I'm not much interested in watching what is on in the US at 3:00a.m.!I'd advise looking at other solutions. I think it is very irresponsible of Slingmedia to have introduced this dramatic reduction in function without telling customers they would be getting less than in the past!"
4,Pretty cool technology,I bought this as a gift for my son who is away at college. He now watches our cable TV from home on his laptop all the time and never misses a Red Wings game while at college. It was very easy to setup and works great. I did have to upgrade my cable service to have faster uploads so that the picture quality would be better over the internet. This makes a great gift!
2,Not worth the money and headache,"We've had our Slingbox for about two years. Everything worked just fine until August 2011. Everytime the power went out in the house we had to completely reset the Slingbox which also involved resetting the Sling and router IP addresses. Resetting the box is incredibly convuluted and multi-stepped. And then there is the really big problem that renders the whole thing completely useless...to reset the Slingbox you have to be IN YOUR HOUSE...which is impossible if you're utilizing the Slingbox to view programming while traveling. Customer Service is via a community help page and/or FAQ's unless, of course, you've paid to talk to the Sling people(approx $39). I get the feeling Slingmedia did something to their software in Aug of 2011 that has caused this problem but as it's nearly impossible to get in touch with someone to resolve the matter the Slingbox will get packed away in the useless electronics box."
5,Must Have,Great Product! Love that I can watch my home team Mets anywhere. I also purchased the add on for my Motorola Q and can watch it anywhere my phone gets signal.
1,50 Great Curries of India,"I was very disappointed in this cookery book. Many of the recipes have ingredients which are not included in the method of preparation. So after getting everything ready, one is left hanging in the air, wondering what to do with the ingredients that are not included."
2,Some good/some bad,This book is beautiful and informative. I cooked the lemon rice which was good. Also I enjoyed the butter chicken even though it didnt have the same color shown in the picture. My complaint so far is that the cashew chicken with black spices recipe was truly terrible and inedible. I have never before cooked something I would not eat. First problem with this recipe was that it calls for too much oil and too much water! The second problem is that it took so long to cook something that tasted so bad. I hate to waste food but that entire dish ended up in the trash. I dont know if I will cook from this book again.
5,Outstanding Cookbook,"This is a wonderful cookbook. In addition to the detailed, but not overly complicated recipes, it has a good amount of basic information about ingredients. This is important, because many of the ingredients are new to non-Indian cooks.I've been very happy with the recipes. Good photos of each dish, and a nice write up on each recipe, explaining the region where the it came from, and the cook or restaurant that created that it."
3,too bland,This is a very attractively presented book but like others I have used from different cuisines the recipes i have tried are very difficult to reproduce visually and are bland and uninteresting in their finality.....not withstanding fresh and authentic ingredients
4,Let's make our OWN curry ...,"Wow, this book just rocks.The first 70 odd pages describes the various curries, ingredients and so on, shows pictures of the various spices in their natural form, tells you the various curries from around Inida (and surrounds).Then: there are oodles of dishes to make - simply awesome and very tasty!!HIGHLY recommended if you're interested in expanding your culinary skills or just want to make your own curry!"
5,My favorite,"This book was a childhood favorite. My grandmother's mother used to read it to her and so on... Her copy was tatterd and torn. I went through great measures to find another copy in better condition for my grandmother two years ago and finally did. You can imagine my excitement to find this brand new reprint is available! I have told all my aunts and uncles and expect they will order a copy, as well. Don't let this one get by, as I am sure it will go out of print again!"
1,One Star Christmas Show,"I am being generous (the Xmas spirit) giving this DVDeven 1 star !!This show is NOT a television ""spectacular"".What this is, is a compilation of approx. 3 minute""skits"" from a vast variety of 1950's performers(most of whom you WILL NOT KNOW).This was spliced together for a 1958 USO tape thatwas sent to 750 military bases around the world.Visual quality is poor at best, and very littleChristmas theme throughout.There are MUCH BETTER ""Christmas DVDs"" offered atlower prices. Very disappointing."
5,"Ah, those were the good old days.","This is a special show, or rather series of shows, that was put together for our troops in the fifties. There are numerous great stars (at least 50) from the period of time when Hollywood still had its glitter and glamour. Danny Kaye, Bob Hope, Rhonda Fleming, Bing Crosby and many more make this a real delight."
2,Not a lot of Christmas music...,"I had big hopes for this movie, but if failed to keep me and my kids interest for more than a few minutes since it doesn't have more than a handful of Christmas songs in it."
3,"They're so low, it's harder to look `em in the eyes!","After almost 30 years of Saints (Bernards,) I'm getting a Basset! What I wanted Ms. Walton to teach me was, what is different about this breed from others? What, specifically, makes a family basset happy & healthy? What I got was a dry lot of high falutin' blood lines and family trees (like all those Biblical 'begats,') home-made kibble recipes (June Cleaver and Martha Stewart are unavailable and I haven't the time - I'd rather play with my puppy!) and Dog Show preparation.Stay tuned for more news of me & my baby basset, Lucy Inda Sky. /TundraVision"
1,Boring Baby Boomer Memoirs,"This book could have been terrific. Just think, there are people here on Earth who once stood on the Moon! What was it like? How did they cope back on Earth? Is life utterly boring for them now?Unfortunately, while failing to answer these questions, Smith writes tediously about himself and his life as a boy in the sixties. There's nothing necessarily wrong with that, but his memoirs are utterly tedious and cliched.No wonder Neil Armstrong has become something of a recluse if journalists like this are always hounding him!"
3,Great introspection on the men who walked on the Moon,"An intriguing idea for a book which asks the question: When you've gone to the moon, what else do you do? Unfortunately, the author wasn't able to talk to all 12 of the astronauts who walked on the moon (Conrad, Irwin and Shepard are dead, Neil Armstrong unavailable) but he did get fascinating portraits of the remaining astronauts and their introspections about walking on the moon and their lives (and divorces) when they returned.Author Smith does put into perspective what the Apollo program achieved, its goals and why further flights were canceled. He spends far too much time comparing the Apollo flights with the 60's cultural upheavel and his own boring (and unnecessary) reminiscences.Worth reading just for the histories of these men and their comments about the program that sent them to the moon."
2,Hard to stay interested.,This book turned out to be more about the author than about the astronauts. It was disappointing. The book was also hard to finish. It was uninteresting in most parts. Not recommended if you are looking for insight on the astronauts.
2,Very Disappointing,"This book was very disappointing for all the reasons already stated, factually inaccurate, rambling, author being self absorbed, etc. The title is misleading and should have been ""Andrew Smith: My thoughts on the Apollo Program (With an a few astronaut interviews thrown in)"".I give it two stars because some of the interviews were interesting.Thankfully I borrowed this book from the library and didn't pay for it. I suggest if you're really interested in reading this book that you do the same..."
1,I gave it 1 star because they don't have 0 stars...,"What utter garbage these discs are. I have never experienced such an abysmal failure rate for any product in my life. Out of 7 discs, 5 failed. After that, I couldn't be bothered trying any more. I had been using a batch of TDK discs before, but only switched to the Maxell because I couldn't write on the TDKs! Bad move - I had not a single problem in 10 TDK discs, unlike the 5 out of 7 failures with Maxell. I will NEVER buy another Maxell product again, and I would strongly urge anyone else to do likewise. Incidentally, my DVD recorder is a Panasonic, not some fly-by-night job no-one's ever heard of."
2,I cannot recommend them,"I have been a longstanding, loyal Maxell customer when it comes to blank audio cassette tapes and VHS tapes. Maxell's tapes were the best.I carried this loyalty over to Maxell's line of blank +R DVDs. I stupidly bought spindle packs three times, despite a large burn failure rate. After this third purchase and suffering a large failure rate again, in TWO different burners, I must sadly say that I will buy them no longer. I got an email back from tech service from the manufacturer of one burner who said they are simply not recommended for use in their recorder.Now, if you have had different experiences, more power to you. But be aware that many people are experiencing poor results with this product. The two brands of burners I have tried them in are Cyberhome, and Memorex Burners. Neither have had any problem with most other brands of blanks, just the Maxell."
2,"Love Burke, but could have left this one on the shelf","I've read just about every book James Lee Burke has written -- from his Dave Robicheaux series to Cimmaron Rose and others. I've loved them all and eagerly await new ones. This is the first time I've read one of his books that I didn't like it. I couldn't connect with the characters, didn't bond with them, didn't find their situation to be compelling to read about. It took all I could do to finish it. It certainly wouldn't dissuade me from reading anything else he writes (although there isn't much left that I haven't read...) but this is not a great book, not up to his usual exploration of characters or his colorful description of surroundings. There was not a likeable character in the book, nor was I able to get a good visual for the surroundings. Skip it if you love Burke, you'll only be disappointed."
3,"Worth reading, not his usual great writing","The book lacks his eloquent language describing sense of place. There are a few great lines, but more simple sentence structure.Interesting theme and plot. Gets more interesting after the first 25%.Worth a read, just not his superb use of the English language evident in his later books. Good themes of poverty, choices made and effects, race, etc."
1,What paradise?,"I got this at a garage sale, and there is no mystery why it ended up there. I held out hope that something -- anything -- would happen to either connect all the separate storylines or make me care about the characters, but I finally had to skim the last 100 pages when it became painfully obvious that the whole book would be a litany of sordid, horrible things happening to characters I didn't really care about. No one comes close to paradise in this book -- everyone starts miserable and goes downhill from there. Its only redeeming benefits are that it offers a window to race relations in the 60's and lets us see that James Lee Burke went through a Hemingway phase early in his career, either accidentally or on purpose."
2,Disappointing.......,"I typically love Burke's books, especially those featuring Dave Robicheaux, so I thought surely I would like this one as well even without Dave. Wrong. Slow, tedious, unlikeable characters with no redeeming qualities. I had to skim through the last half of the book just to say I finished it. Don't bother. Wait for the next ""Dave"" book."
1,Mind Numbing,"I am a fan of James Lee Burke and even I thought this was horrible. It was so utterly boring it is hard to describe. Though some of his books are long winded, the plot and character development makes up for it. This story, however, was completely devoid of any suspense, the characters are silly and the whole thing was a total disappointment!"
3,When we were young.,"This is one of Burke's earlier books and Burke gets better with each effort. In my estimation, that makes all of Burke's vintage work wonderful reading while allowing me to lust for another new tale."
1,half of paradise,I was very disappointed when I got this book as I was led to believe it was a new release.On starting to read it however I found that is had been writtedn long agoi and I had read it then.A waste of $12.00 plus!
2,Not as nice looking as in Photo,"Thought this was a good looking shoe, not so much when I recieved it. It is good to wear but the color is off and the quality is much lower than it looks."
3,From Chaos is From Chaos,"What happened to ""letting the kind conciousness come unto you"" this cd is nowhere near as ""kind"" lyricaly or melodically as grassroots, transistor, or even soundsystem. I feel as though nick, chad, sa, p-nut, and tim have lost something or let something get to them that got in the way of the heart and soul that was 311. My loyalty to 311 was challenged with this cd. It was like a ugly sweater that your grandma gets you, you won't wear it but you don't want her to feel bad either. With the exception of uncalm, I'll be here awhile, and you wouldn't believe ~ This cd hurts ~ But who cares what Destiny thinks ~"
4,Great book but no cover art,"I was happy to find a new copy of Hot Rod for this price. It's one of the best of the car series from Henry Gregor Felsen, and all the books are apparently highly collectible, sometimes bringing a hundred dollars for an old paperback. However, this copy didn't include the lurid cover art shown in the ad--rather than the great shot of Hot Rod kids in action, you get a plain cover with no picture at at--supposedly a school edition. I don't know if someone reprinted these no frills renditions or if someone found a cache of them from the fifties or sixties. While I would have liked to have had the cover as advertised, for me it doesn't matter so much; the text is all there. But if you expect to get the fine pop art cover as advertised, you'll need to look elsewhere."
3,Saris Traps Quick Release Bike Mount Block,"The product is basic. If used with a suspension fork, then a better skewer is recomended to allow easier locking and releasing. The ends of the mount that contact the fork dropouts are painted black. This paint is easily chipped and caused resistance to sliding onto the skewer. My solution was to sand the paint off on either end."
2,Minidisc still rules.,"Comparing the two items, the only area the Rio clearly wins is recording. Being able to download the songs instead of recording is great. However, the lack of storage space and the prohibitive price of memory expansion is what convinced me to buy a Sony Minidisc recorder instead. The compression techonology used by Sony gives quality equivalent to over 320kb/s. Using that kind of quality on a Rio would result in the amount of music being ridiculously low. Trust me. Spend the extra $50 or so and get minidisc. You won't regret it."
4,I love this but not as much as I could,The player is great once you figure out some of it's features and navigate the software. I would recommend using the Real Jukebox to manage your playlist everything else is either too cumbursome to deal with or is not compatible with the Rio player. I would have liked a few more features and maybe some instructions rather than just telling me what everything was. I might not have needed the instructions in the end but I would have liked to have them anyway.
3,good but this is better...,"I just want to emphasise what a reviewer several pages backsaid...""...Already, companies like MamboX arecreating the much-awaited portable CD/mp3 players which can read both mp3 and regular CD tracks from any CD. At 650 MB per CD, there's not much comparison with the handhelds- you can hold over 600 minutes of music, or 150+ tracks. And did I mention that these players sell for $200-$300?""""Don't shortchange yourself by buying a regular mp3 handheld (their one advantage is no skippable parts; but are you really going to notice any skipping with on a CD player with 45-seconds ESP?)...."""
1,IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY,It is less for more. Even though it is a name brand I own it and a rave mp player and I would say by a large amount that my rave is better. It was cheaper had a built in mic and had the same amount of space. Also it looked better you cant do much better then that. oh and the headphones are actually good. plus it has a audio in and out port along with a computer connection.The rio 500 needs it price brought down I mean is a name brand worth more money?
1,Buy the Nomad II instead.,"I owned a Rio 300, and after awhile, it became very sensitive that the slightest touch would stop it from playing. So I exchanged it for the Rio 500un, which worked great til the next day when trying to download songs into it, the Rio 500 went dead. After getting a new Rio 500, the same thing happened after two weeks. Technical Support said that if the battery is low while downloading files, the player dies. Apparently, 2 out of 50 calls Tech Support recieves are due to this problem. Don't waste your time with the Rio 500, instead spend the extra money and get a sturdier and more reliable MP3 Player that also has many extra features, the NOMAD 2."
4,Newest Firmware Upgrade Compatible With 128mg Ext. Cards,"I won't rehash most of the comments hear except to say that I am generally pleased with this player. The sound is good, though it lacks some punch and detail, and it can be a little cranky about handling files consistently (skips or forgets bookmarks, etc.).Mostly, I want to let folks know that the newest firmware upgrade (for free, available on the Rio website) allows the player to recognize 128 smartmedia cards. So currently I have 192 megs of music on my player! This alone makes this a very convenient player."
4,Good machine but poor documentation,"Two quick negatives about this machine:1. Documentation is terrible. You'll be hard pressed to find even the most basic instructions in the manual.2. Software is buggy and will cause your system to lock up on occasaion.The player itself is very good. I would also suggest looking at the Rave MP2100 MP3 player before you make up your mind.Though this is a neat little machine, I am not sure that the USB option works as fast as it's touted in the promotional literature. Recommended with some hesitation."
5,Better than expected,"This is my second plunge into the world of MP3 players and the experience has been considerably better than my first. The Rio 500 offers about as much as you could expect from an MP3 player these days (outside of the cheap headphones). The USB upload is considerably faster than the parallel ports that most MP3 players utilize. The sound is good and the software program that is included makes transferring audio from CD to the player a snap. Transferring downloaded files is just as easy. My only real complaint is the terrible directions/manual. Instillation of the drivers (Windows version) was not adequately explained. I'm somewhat of a computer geek so I figured it out in short order, but somebody unfamiliar with plug and play instillation could easily find themselves stuck with the player unable to communicate with his/her computer. Outside of that this player is, in my opinion, the best available."
2,one of my best acheevments,if you get this item make sher you by an extra memery card/only holds 12 songs with out
2,"Great, but not so good",I have a love hate relationship with this item. I love it when its playing I hate it because it takes 50 batteries a month to use it!!
4,"Good player, software.....?","Well, i must say that the player is very good...music quality is very good...The software [is not good], but you can use Realjukebox... Many people have complaints regarding the support. My rio broke down one day, for no raeson (checkerboard error, couldn't fix it with the patch...). I e-mailed for support and i explained my problem. 2 days later, i got a mail back saying that i could send my rio to them and they would replace it...3 weeks later i had my new player. I think that this is an example of very good support..."
5,Love my rio 500!,"I've had my rio 500 and I love it to bits! It goes everywhere I go, and is so easy to lose into my pocket. {That's a good thing, it fits!} It has 64 built in memory, which is great, and can take up to 2 more extrenal memory cards, which makes it greater. The only thing that makes it less valuable is that the external and internal memories are counted as seperate storage areas, meaning you can't have half a song on each one. This makes sense since you can easily remove the memory card at any given time.This thing is also very durable. I've dropped it on rocks, cement, and even stepped on it and have never had any change in the playing quality. I have, however cracked the LCD while running and hitting the ground at 30mph, but I think anything would break like that.This product also incudes a random mode, program list, and some other options to make the sound quality better. I strongly recommend the rio 500, it really beats the old CD players and other low-memory portable devices."
3,"Nice player, bad everything else","No qualms about the player itself, but the Audio Manager program is very shaky depending on your system setup. Though I had the minimum requirements for running the prog, it flickered repetitively after clicking on the ""Devices"" button, and the Rio would stop responding after spending so much time fighting with the prog. Here's my basic setup for interested buyers:HP Pavillion 8500 series Pentium 3 666 MHz proc. 64 meg RAMYou may wish to consult others who have similar computers and see how well the device runs on their system. My biggest problem with the Diamond RIO, and perhaps a problem that will ultimately lead me to averting all further products by this company, is their lack of technical support. I initially emailed them about the problem, and they replied with advice that I had already tried. Immediately after, I responded, explaining everything I had tried as well as the behaviour of the equipment. Two weeks later, I have still not recieved a response."
3,"Great product, but it needs better instructions","I bought my Diamond Rio 500 a couple of months ago & I have really enjoyed it, but I have one major complaint. It only comes with one page of very baisic instructions. There were some very important functions that I didn't even know about for about a month after I bought it, until I finally found someone else on the net who was able to help me. If you have a Macintosh computer, then I would recomend this player to you over the other players available for Mac OS because of the functions and the ease of use after you get past the instruction problem, but I would not recomend buying this if you don't know anybody else who owns one who can help you learn how to use it. Overall, I have to rate this player at 3 stars, but if it wasn't for the instruction problem, I would probably rate the player at about 4 1/2 stars."
1,do yourself a favor,assume that you're aware that the software they ship with this unit is garbage and that there are other decent options that are free. assume that you dont care that the earphones that they ship with this unit is trash. you can buy much better ones. assume that you dont need a decent manual. You can figure it out because you're a gadgethead and by reading posts on the net. assume that you dont care that the little carrying case is a joke. assume that you know you'll get no decent information on their web site other than how to polish your darling rio or cute names to give it. But do yourself a favor and read ALL the one star reviews in this list and COUNT on your unit getting fried after an innocuous little download and COUNT on having a grand time in customer service hell.... My sony minidisk player was recently crushed by my rollerblades and it still works and sounds better than the rio ever did. the rio is a fine unit... as long as it works...
4,Your search for a great MP3 player stops here,"I bought the Rio 500 a few days ago after reading the comments on this forum. I echo the statements about the documentation being woefully sparse, but since I already had RealJukebox installed I was able to use that with ease.With an existing stash of mp3 files and having RealJukebox already installed I was ready to listen within about 20 minutes.This is a great player if that's what you're after. To the reviewers that complain it's too expensive -- WAH! Relatively new electronics always are. If you can't afford it either buy something more low-end or wait awhile until the prices come down or the item just becomes obsolete.My 2 minor complaints are the requirement of Win98 -- no NT option, and the foam covers on the headphone earbuds come off easily, but buy it anyway!"
1,Totally worthless in Win 2000,"This product doesn't work at all in Win 2000 and Diamond apparently has no plans to support Win 2000. The driver will install just fine and the software would probably run OK, but it refuses to install under Win 2000."
1,Don't buy it,"In less then a year after I bought this it already broke. A simple tap to it and it will turn off and back on. This makes it useless, if I am able to get it on at all. RIO provided no customer support, a bad and outdated product."
1,Disappointed,"I had to return my Rio after two weeks of its failing to work properly. Once I did get it working, it then went dead. Rio's response? Too bad. If you want to see how bad they are, check out their website. Look for the feedback section and you'll see there is none. (In fact, you'll see that the site doesn't acknowledge the new Rio 600, which has been advertized in our newspaper for some time now; are these folks asleep?) Case closed for me."
1,Dont buy an mp3 player!,"If you are rich as hell, go ahead and buy it. But for the price your paying for this, you could get a great Mini Disk player, and even plenty of discs for over 6,000 minutes of recording time with the same sound quality! Dont believe me? Goto the Mini Disc section and do the math! Even better, you can record mp3's onto the MiniDisk players, you can also record your voice, your playstation/N64/Dreamcast, VCR, TV, Radio, Tape, everything! I almost bought an mp3 player, and im glad i didn't. MP3's are too expensive compared to Mini-Disks, and if you look at the Mini Disk trend right now, its exactly like the CD trend 10 years ago. They are already making Mini Disk drives fro computers to store info. Just check out the Mini Disks before you buy this, trust me, you'll thank me. If you have any questions, email me, Ill answer them asap!"
4,"Great Hardware, Documentation and Software Needs Work","Major gripes for the Rio500 seem to be headphones, software and Audible.com support. Just got mine in and immediately I updated the Rio500's firmware to 2.11 (it ships with 1.04) to allow for Audible.com support and support for 64MB flash cards. Next you must download Audible.com's AudibleManager - the software that ships with the Rio doesn't upload the Audible.com sound files themselves. The software (RioPort) was my biggest complaint... after I registered the 2.x version that comes with the Rio500 (gotta register the 2.x version FIRST), I upgraded to the 3.x version. Works okay... but some tracks seem to be getting stuck in the middle of downloading tracks to the MP3 player (RioPort just freezes up). Never tested the headphones... heard so many bad things about them... immediately ditched 'em and got a nice pair of Sony earbuds. Sounds great to me. Sound quality and hardware: very nice. Software and documentation: needs work."
4,A High Quality Mp3 Player With Software-Related Issues,"A better buy than all the other players on the market at the moment. It offers a large onboard memory (64MB), expansion (though it would be better to wait for higher density cards to emerge than buy the ones available at the moment), high quality playback and fast USB download capabilities. However, the software requires much perseverence. The basic bundle completely confuses the way your mp3s are stored on your HD and the upgrades (Audio Manager 3.2 being the most conspicuous of the bunch) occasionally lead to lower quality playback. Also, you will only ever get about 10 hours play out of the batteries rather than the quoted 13. Still, this is still better than most other products. In short, as long as you stick with the original software and wait for better cards, the Rio 500 is undoubtedly the best product available at the moment."
5,I will never use my CD player again,"This little piece of plastic is amazing. I bought a Rio 500 and a 16 MB smart card. Between the 64 MB onboard memeory and the memory expansion, I can get 2 and a half hours of music. I can buy CDs and put them on quickly and effortlessly. I can download free music from the internet. Best of all, it's smaller than my wallet! All this music in the palm of my hand! It's amazing. If you even remotely listen to any kind of music, do yourself a favor and buy this. You won't regret it. I will never buy anything else to listen to my music. That is, until the Rio 600"
4,"Good Hardware, Software needs work.","I bought my Rio direct from Diamond on October 6th, of last year. I took them until December 17 to send it out. It included little documentation, quirky software, and the support at Diamond when I called in was horrible. The headphones are little to be desired for, but hey.. you get what you pay for. (In this case, a lot of moola for little gadgets) I suggest buying the upgraded headphones and remote from them. (For more moola) .. better get a job or save some money if you don't already!"
1,IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY,It is less for more. Even though it is a name brand I own it and a rave mp player and I would say by a large amount that my rave is better. It was cheaper had a built in mic and had the same amount of space. Also it looked better you cant do much better then that. oh and the headphones are actually good. plus it has a audio in and out port along with a computer connection.
3,"Nice unit, lousy software","The actual unit is well thought out, with some nice little features like EQ, and a jogger dial. Headphones were awful, even though they were Koss. The software is not very intuitive, and it's difficult to add files from my hard drive effectively. Get the extra memory, you can't put enough of your favorite songs on this thing."
4,Rio Bravo,This player rocks! If you want a durable MP3 player you can't go wrong with the 500. I take oRIOn (cool name huh?) with me on bike rides. One time I was riding down a stretch of road and while replacing the batteries and it flew out of my hand and skidded down the pavement. I thought oRIOn was dead! Needless to say he was AOK (just a little scarred up).PROs Tough as nails. Plenty of memory. Button layout. Volume level range. You can actually hear the music! USB.CONsSoftware - Can't delete multiple songs from the database with a single selection. Battery is a little tough to get to (see above).The moral of the story? Don't replace and ride.
1,Audible can't get it right !,"After way more aggrevation than this thing could ever be worth, and an apparent inability for Audible to deliver software that actually works w/o crashing, I'm throwing this thing on the book shelf. I feel taken advantage of by Audible. It seems they have established a track record with me of not returning e-mails for customer support also. Knowing what I know now, I would rely on Audible softwares ability to transfer to the RIO 500! With all the gadgets, upgrades and software I've dealt with, I have never seen anything sold that works with less reliability! My problems seems to be primarily with Audible's software!"
2,"Great player, shiffy support","The Rio 500 was way before its time. It has 64 MB of onboard memory. It plays well and only takes one AA battery since it has no moving parts. That's the good part. Well....The problem lies in the fact that the manufacturer has dropped the ball on customer support. I have upgraded to Windows XP, just as most people have. Rio refuses to put out software which enables you to connect your Rio 500 to your computer via USB port if you have Windows XP. I have tried many solutions, including those found at Rio user sites, trying to come up with an answer to this. The outcome: the same songs are on the player for over a year. In other words: YOU CANNOT PLACE MUSIC ON THE 500 IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS XP. Unbelieveable....next..."
5,I love this thing!,"Too many good things to list, just read any review of this product and you'll understand why. For all who are looking into a mp3 player, this is the one, at least for now."
1,"64MB external, only a promotion joke?","as a samsung yepp owner i desided to complete my mp3 park with the rio 500 for expanding memory and ability to recieve audible formats. rio promotes with the audiomanager 3 and firmware 2.12 the 64MB external use. a joke: olympus 64MB and ONT 64MB are not formatable (the rio recognize the 64MB, but after start formation, the rio hangs and can be only relocked by removing the bat). the rio tech support is insufficient, compareable with the rio song quality. i resume: samsung has the only ultimate 5-star yepp-sound and i have had better kept my fingers away from rio. now i am hearing my audibles from my hp jornada, sitting on my rio to hide them. schumacher, md samba@swissonline.ch"
2,IF it only worked....,I bought one for a friend since I was very happy with my Rio 300. However the new Rio500 didn't work at all. It ate batteries at the rate of one per hour and skipped around through songs randomly. My replacement is one the way. To be continued....
2,Little for Lots: Almost zero features for a million dollars,"My opinion is that the Rio player, along with most MP3 players, lack features that other types of players are capable of. One of these features that it lacks is that Rio has a lot of memory for a MP3 player these days, and it can only play 2 HOURS of songs with its onboard memory. After that, its $100 for a 1 hour (32mb) flash card. With CD's and MD's, the hour is for about $3. Also, there are not many different models to choose from, whoch is a drawback. There is also the problem of BATTERIES. Now, I have a suckie CD player, so I only get 6 hours every 2 batteries, but some CD players can accomnplish 50+ hours of CD playing on 2 batteries. 12 hrs/1 battery is pretty much outragous (thats why I need a new CD player). Wait a couple years for better MP3 players. Untill then, I recommend a MiniDisc System or A CD System. Much Better Value."
1,WARNING,I reacently bought the diamond rio 500 mp3 player and i was really excited to get it. But when I installed it and all that other crap it wouldnt work! I found out that my mp3 player was defective. I called rio and they said that there is alot of defective ones out there so be aware. If you do get a defective one send it back and I suggest getting the sony vaio music clip it is probably easier than the rio to use. But if my rio worked I would have gave it a 5 stars.
1,MP3 PLAYER vs. MINIDISC,"Look, if you are anything like me, u have spent what seems like hours comparing mini discs and mp3 players you'll fine this advice useful. To me, haveing both the Rio and a Sony Mini Disc, the MD is much much better. It's quality is GREAT, can also get mp3's off any computer with a sound card, and it has unlimited space(each cd cost 1 to 2 dollars. So, go with the MD, don't make the mistake i did, in buying the rio first. Happy shopping."
2,Great player but support and software is AWFUL,"I'm writing this with a little sadness because i really do love my Rio player and it has given me many hours of happiness when i otherwise would have been bored on the treadmill. Still, if I had it to do over again I would buy a different player because I have had no end of problems. Both Mac and PC versions of the software are buggy and there are no fewer than three different customer support departments (one for the player and two for the software), each of which are very sorry, but another department has to handle my problem. I've given up on them & will never buy another Diamond product again."
2,Warning - RIO 500 Upload death,"While uploading mp3 files using the WIN software provided with the player - The RIO suddenly went black - that is all the pixels turned black on its screen. This condition persists even after turning the unit on and off again or replacing the battery. I called Diamond customer service and they said that this is a problem they are discovering - that if the battery is not fully energized (Brand new) that the ROM in the RIO can become permanently scrambled during a download session making the RIO totally unusable. So - I think I'll wait for a better solution after Amazon refunds my money. My RIO is fried, dead, kaput, ruined, lost. Maybe there is a ROM upgrade they might figure out - but I would wait for a while."
4,rio 500,"i've had this player for about 1 day. i've gone through all the reviews on this site and sifted through the pros and cons. most of the cons expressed by others did not apply to me, the software loaded without a hitch, i downloaded songs with no problem, i was up and running in under the 20 minutes it took a previous reviewer. i will agree that the case's webbing impedes the access to the volume. and i wish when i was in browse mode that the complete title would scroll for better viewing (presently you only see the artist). i also wish i could upload songs. but these are just minor quibles. this is an excellent product that feels sturdy and performs well. one suggestion, ditch the earbuds for a better set of headphones and you'll enjoy the experience even more"
2,"If you got windows, dont buy","This thing basically (is bad). The firewire option is great- if it worked half the time. I had to remove the drivers of the usb port, restart constantally, reinstall the program which transfers files, and half the time it still didnt work. And no i didnt just use one computer, we have 3 in my house. I returned it, got another one, same problems. The only way i got it to work is to use a horrible old version of the software which screwed up the names of songs so you have to guess on which one you are adding- big waste of money."
2,Quality Control Issues,"I'm sure that this is a great product - if you can get the included software working (Rioport Manager.) I downloaded one song to the Rio, but now the app freezes whenever I try to connect.The firmware update program is a joke - still says v1.04, even after supposedly upgrading to 1.15 I use several other USB devices with no problem, but not this one.Diamond MM seems to have an overall quality control problem, even dating back to my Diamond Stealth video card from 1993 - it worked okay, but just try to get new drivers or tech support (same problems back then!)Sorry for the negative review - but I'm looking for a different brand."
4,Great MP3 player; needs to support more memory,"I got my player a few weeks ago and have had a great time with it. The sound quality is terrific and the controls are easy enough to use without referencing a manual. My only complaint is that I want the ability to use more memory. The unit ships with 64 meg (which is nice), but you can only add an additional 32 meg (using smartmedia card). While I am up to 96 meg, it's still not enough! I also downloaded a ROM patch to give the unit more usability and features. Now, waiting for ROM patch to allow access of greater memory levels. My suggestion to all who are thinking about the unit -- get one! You will not be disappointed."
3,Bummed out,"I used to love my rio 500, but now i can't seem to find any help with new software that is compatable with my new computer and XP. Rioport.com is aparently out of bus. and i have been misdirected several times. If anyone has any useful information for my I would be extremly happy. as for now i don't have anyway to change my music on my rio."
2,Worthless if you run Windows 2000,"I loved my Rio 500 until I loaded Windows 2000. From what I can tell, it is not compatible and SONICblue is not offering a fix. Now my beloved Rio 500 is worthless and I am not likely to buy another SONICblue product."
1,What ever you do..Please DONT buy this product,"I am highly annoyed about this product. The software for thisplayer is complete GARBAGE. It constanely freezed and it would tell memy mp3 player was full, when I am trying to add a song on the empty player. I was shipped another one of these crappy products but still had no luck, Because the software is trash. Don't buy product so you wount waste your time and money shipping it back. I will be going to Mail Box ect to ship them back tomorow."
4,"Hard to begin, GREAT to to use!","When I first received my Rio it was very frustrating. The Software istall CD was broken. I E-Mailed Rio to see what to do, they directed me to the site where to download the software -simple enough. Well now I had a new problem: the player installed itself to the wrong place in the hard drive- making itself undetectable to the Audio Manager. Well anyways, it took two days but it was worth it. I give the Rio500 4 stars because the technical staff at Rio was very helpful and now that it is working it is excellent. Some people complain that the volume should go higher, it's lower than the others, but fine none of the less."
4,"""Well worth my money""","After using the rio 500 for one day, i experienced the ""checkerboard screen"" which occurs when you transfer files and the battery dies. Gladly enough, their customer service emailed me a recovery program specifically for that problem. I thought I would have return the player, but the prog fixed it.Their software is... ok. I tried transferring 2 specific mp3's but the program just kept constantly crashing. It's strange how they can't even let me add tracks to the portable device list.The reason I gave this player 4 stars was because of its hardware. It's small, rugged, and the usb makes transferring fast. I also like the backlit display and the ability to sort your music through folders.It's well worth my money ..."
1,Solution in search of a problem.,"I just received a Rio 500 as a gift. Turns out that the software does not support NT (or Win95). I don't have a USB board anyway.Since it was a gift, it is too awkward to explain (no, I'm not going to run out and give Microsoft more money, or buy more computer hardware just to use this thing) and near impossible to graciously return, or exchange.To be honest, I'm trying to figure out why I'd want to fill up my hard drive with ""ripped"", versions of my CD collection. I already own the CDs and they aren't eating up space on my hard drive. Since the Rio only comes with enough memory to hold approximately one CD anyway, what's the point?I could load the Rio with MP3's found on the net, but what's to find? Bootlegged versions of stuff I already have, or MP3's by garage bands nobody has ever heard of, and probably never will.Gadgetry for gadgetry's sake."
3,cool man,"I think the Rio Diamond sounds real good and stuff and it looks pretty sweet man. The only thing it needs is to be a bit tuffer so you can do welding and stuff when you listing to it y'know. Overall is pretty not bad apart from being a wussy piece of equipment, not like my truck dude."
4,Rio 500 works as advertised,"Fast, light and the USB connection is great. The only real problems are the volume control doesn't go loud enough and the control knobs are not easy to ""feel"" in you pocket so you can control the unit while jogging without looking."
4,A good recorder with some problems,"The documentation to get started is sketchy at best. I almost took the unit back and thought it was flawed because I could not get it to download to the recorder. Ripping from a CD is fast, and downloading is also fast, but it appears that battery life might be a problem since it shows considerable use after a couple of hours. I also have a mini disk player and will not throw this away since it is more flexible in repeating songs and the disks aren't that big that they are a pain to carry. In essence, the price may be a bit high, but the quality is great and the unit is nice to carry. I am not sorry that I bought it since it is nice to download songs right from the net. Jim"
3,Great while it worked,"I thought this was the best thing since sliced bread. No skips, lightweight, and great for taking with me on bike rides. Then one night while loading songs into it I could no longer communicate with it but I could play the songs that were still in it. I put in a fresh battery, and it still didn't communicate. After a long talk with tech support they advised me to send it back for exchange. I got another one. About 4 days later the exact same thing happened. I sent it back for a refund."
5,The Best RIo Ever,The RIO 500 IS ONE OF THE BEST MP3 PLAYERS ON THE MARKET. AMAZON.COMHAS THE LOWEST PRICE ON IT AND THATS AMAZING. NOT ONLY DOES IT HAVE 64MB ON BOARD BUT IT CAN BE UPGRADABLE. THE HEADPHONES ARE GREAT TOO. THE ONLY THING I TINK IS WIERD IS THAT THEY CHARGE [less] FOR THE GRAY RIO AND [more] FOR THE TEAL AND BLUE. THE RIO 500 HAS THE EST SOUND QUALITY I HAVE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE.
1,Thank goodness this company doesn't make cars,So far I've owned three products manufactured by this company and ALL three were defective. I bought a RIO 600 which never worked. I had the same problems that eight billion other people had -- loud pops and the unit's inability to play a song over 60 seconds.I called the company and asked if this was a common defect and they answered... NO.I also had two separate RIO 500s that each stopped working after a month. The software never worked because it refused to recognize the RIO 500 or 600.I WOULDN'T BUY A DOG TOY FROM THIS COMPANY!!
5,Revolutionary New Technology for the Person on the Go,"The Rio 500 is the second member of the first wave of technology harnessing the awesome power of mp3. Mp3, which stands for MPEG Layer-3 (of course), is the digital music format that can compress music to 1/11 of the original size without a loss of intergity. Needless to say, this scares the music industry... Among the Rio's innumerable benefits are its lack of moving parts, which in turn means no skipping while you move around with your Rio. Also, the new Rio 500 has 64MB of flash memory, which will allow you to carry one hour of 128kps music (cd quality) or 2 hours of 64kbps (near cd quality). Flash card accessories will expand this capability another 1/2 hour at full and 1 hour at half quality. The Rio 500 is an absolute necessity for the technology enthusiast. (I recommend the teal :)"
4,Rio 500 Review,"The Rio 500 is a nice compact light MP3 player. It has a nice screen and a quality backlight. The song name are easy to read. The only problem I have it that it loses its USB connection when transferring songs sometimes. One feature I really like is that the single AA battery lasts for 13 hours of continuous play. The software works very well and can be updated online for free. I think that it's a good package and worth buying. Even though it has a minor connection problem, I would recommend it 100%. -Satisfied Customer"
3,PAMMY'S REVIEW,Very nice sturdy villian but he towers above the rangers in a freaky way. Nice toy but doesn't fit product line.
4,Songs Scouts Sing,"This is a book to ""settle your mind"" when you remember those songs from your childhood/scouting days, but are frustrated when you don't quite remember all the words. It all comes back when you find the one you are seeking and stumble upon many other pleasant memories."
3,Not his best.,"This is not one of Seller's finest. He turns in a capable and charming performance but cannot save the script from itself. Added to this is the number of inside jokes that are only accessible to the British and you have a film that is difficult for American audiences.The plot isn't actually bad. It raises some good questions and seems to build towards what may be a wonderful ending, but then becomes mired in a silly and pointless finish that doesn't relate to the main questions it raises. As a typical American who has a soft spot for British film and for Sellers I'm sorry to say I found it to be less than rewarding.Most aspects of the film are capable including direction, photography, and acting. I found the film interesting as a cultural artifact, revealing insights into British life during that time, but this is not enough to make it a film to own unless one must have every Sellers' film ever made."
3,when you get to heaven,"A farmer and a priest share an Mercury space ship?The recent movieThe Astronaut Farmerhas a very different slant on space travel than this movie.In both cases the farmer and the priest are very misunderstoodand figures of fun for those living normal lives around them.In one movie the idea that private dreams of space can come true,in the other the priest gives his life to save the Astronaut.Peter Sellers has made a movie making fun of Christian idealsand Christian charity, and in the other secular ideals as dreams arerewarded with happiness. What has changed between 1964 and 2004that space appears in such contrast in two movies?"
4,Very funny social/religious satire with Sellers. Say n'more!,"What a brilliant script and movie.Sellers inhabits his role perfectly, the supporting players are all spot on, and the endless barbs and accompanying subtle visual gags are often laugh out loud funny.And boy oh boy, no mercy is shown to organized religion and big business (if there is any real difference). Razor sharp satire hits home again and again, as in, ""Try Tranquilax! It stimulates! It sedates! It's a laxative!"" And when the priest turns down a donation because the givers aren't true Christians...well, this is fiction, after all.At moments Heavens Above feels like the logical precursor to Monty Python, in many ways. A higher compliment would be hard to find.Beautifully shot with lots of natural light as well.This film has aged perfectly; its only fault is a rather weak ending.I'm glad there are so many truly intelligent old movies like this out there; they sure ain't making many these daze!Very worth watching."
3,Great help material,If you need it after reading the books.. Great tool for essays and tests... Also nice for purpose of remembering what book was about
4,Of Mice and Men,A helpful summary for after reading the book. Good for refreshing thoughts on the chapters and taking notes for in class.
1,Usless,"One star is gernerous for this useless book. Although it costs very little, it is a complete waste of money. The only IG Book you need is Lilian Barber's The New Complete Italian Greyhound. It covers everything from the basics to information the most knowlegable IG owner can learn from."
4,Those little horses,This was a very helpful book about Italian Greyhounds along with general information about dog care.
2,All the real nasty stuff is missing!!!!!!!!!!!,"Yes, this is a very sleazy WIP from Italian exploitation master Vincent Dawn, but don't record over your bootlegs just yet. Hopefully WPM will someday be released by Shriek Show or Blue Underground, because this DVD is cut to hell. A quick flashback near the end of the film even contains scenes that were trimmed from the source print. We shouldn't still have to put up with this crap in 2005! An exploitation movie without the exploitation is like porno without the penetration."
1,R-RATED MORE LIKE PG,"Just finished watching this movie and all i got to say is that i see a lot more violence on a saturday morning cartoon show. the movie is so badly edited i couldn't follow the story the film transfer is crappy, all the blood and guts are cut from the movie, everytime there is an action scene there's this big jump in the film and sound. it was almost like watching an r-rated movie on primetime television. the worst part about it all is that this movie looks entertaining but because they cut everything out you can't tell. whoever is responsible should go to jail."
2,Keep the Video,"I actually rented this little sleaze wonder along time ago. I was wondering when Shriek Show or Blue Underground would release this title in it its original form? Imagine my surprise when I found this gem at a DVD store. AND it's letterboxed, too! The way the package was marketed, it seemed to me this film was the uncut version! WRONG! What a rip-off! The DVD presentation is letterboxed, has a scratchy print, and is more incomplete than the Vestron video version. Oh well, the trailers the DVD offers give a very clear reason why the B movie is in such a sad state.Keep the Vestron Video version."
3,A hearty sequel,"somehow,this movie really didnt make a lot of sense comapared to the hit original Violence in a Women's Prison. The Cheif Warden is back at prison,the Cheif Guard is back from the dead,and some of the various prisoners have moved up and become guards. The Doctor from the previous movie becomes a convict and works with other men convicts to take control of the womens prison. Soon,the women are helpless against the men convicts,and have become terrified prisoners themselves. The storyline becomes a hostage situation and there is the usual violence,with plenty of blood and gore,and explosive gun battles. emmanuelle is back for the sequel,and is taking charge against the men for her immenent freedom. The movie has some sensuality and lesbian sex,as always,but the story is kind of screwed up. Enjoy!"
2,didn't deliver,"This movie is the sequel to caged woman but not as good. For a movie like this you would expect a reasonable amount of nudity etc.You will be disappointed like I was . Some nice looking Italian women, but alas only a couple of scenes where they get naked.approx 2 minutes. The story line. Male prisoners escape and take over the womans prison."
2,Mediocre and slow moving,"Mediocre and slow moving. The filmmakers luck briefly into a couple of good scenes - well, they're too short to be called scenes, let's say a couple of good shots. And there's one good actor who pretty much steals the show whenever he's on camera. Sadly, I didn't catch his name, though from later reading I think it may have been Gabriele Tinti."
1,You ve gotta hand it to the publicity boys....,"No one could ever say that "" Womens Prison Massacre was a good film, but you have gotta hand it to the publicity boys. It seems obvious that the guys who designed the cover had never seen the movie. Made on a budget that would nt cover the cost of making a 2 minute TV comercial this film was just a complete bore. No graphic violence to speak of and the nudity, often the backbone of this kind of film, was also non existance. It could have been, should have been, and would have been a decent film if it had been handed to someone who knew what they were doing but I am afraid ""Womens Prison Massacre"" would even leave the ""Raincoat Brigade"" dozing in their seats."
5,THE REDNEX ROCK!,"I'm proud to have a copy of the Rednex' only album--SEX & VIOLINS--which I bought in May 1996. The first song I heard from that album was COTTON-EYE JOE, which I heard on the radio, in 1994.The Rednex--from Stockholm, Sweden, by the way--were successful in combining country music and techno to form a unique sound that only the Rednex (as far as I know) could produce: high-tech country!I'm not a country music fan; but, I still recommend SEX & VIOLINS to everyone."
4,"Rednex: ""Sex and Violins"" is awesome!!",I don't even own this CD and I know it is awesome!! I plan on getting in soon from what I have heard. It doesn't even have to be a hick party to have fun with the Rednex!! This CD is awesome for parties of all kinds!!
5,Fun Fun Fun!,A whole CD packed full of great fun! This is a fast paced cross of dance and country music!
5,Hard to find CD,"This is a special CD which needed to be replaced. The going rate was too much money. Then I looked at Amazon. They did the search for me, and when it became available, YAY!!Thanks!!!"
5,A Must for all people searching for Truth,"This book is with out a doubt for anyone searching for truth a must read, Not for the light hearted or dabler in spiritual truths, but an amazing book, which answers many questions for mankind"
1,A Waste.,"The book is garbage. The supposed history is false. The ""hidden monastery"" is little better than an expansion of the centuries old belief in Shambhala. This is a damaging book written by a man with too much time on his hands, not enough intelligence, and a warped idea of the basic concepts of Buddhism (not to mention the total lack of understanding of Tibetan history).Save your cash, and skip this trash."
1,Too many contradictions in the teachings,"The book may make sense, or even be enlightening for those who aren't familiar with Buddhism and Vedanta. In fact, the teachings presented in this book are taken from Buddhism and Vedanta. The only originality in the book is the story of Atlantis, which can only remain fictitious. There are big differences between Buddhism and Vedanta. When the author mixes teachings from both Buddhism and Vedanta, the book turns into a whirl of contradictions. If you want to follow true spiritual paths, look up Vedanta or Buddhism. This book may be a good read for those who aren't serious about spirituality, but those who seek spiritual enlightenment must disregard this book."
5,The Most Incredible Book Out There,"Way beyond interesting! In this book you'll find the Truth, clearly communicated. There is no book like it. It can change your life (it certainly did mine). HIGHLY recommended for those of you who want to know what life is really all about. Do you want to learn about Real Love?.."
2,Very Disappointing.,"This book is more a tourist guide to trivia than a guide to places of scandal, mayhem, and celluloid. How scandalous is the place that inspired the Beach Boys hit ""Fun, fun, fun""!?!"
3,MISSED A COUPLE,"Excellent on detail and accuracy, heavy on rock 'n' roll; some odd omissions(e.g., entry on Palace Hotel in San Francisco does not mention that President Harding died there in 1923; the list of sites from Hitchcock's picture Vertigo omits the Argonaut bookstore [called Argosy bookstore in the movie - both because of the gold associated with the city]). Below the belt comments about Ronald Reagan."
3,TABLOID VIEW OF CALIFORNIA,"Yeah, it's all here - the scandals, murders, drugs, etc. - kind of a condensed version of the tabloids at the market checkout station. It is outdated but definitely gives you an inside look at behind the scenes of the movies and musicals. I must say I found it entertaining and added a few 'must-see' stops on my next California adventure. PLease read it for general interest about celebrities and wealthy people - not classic literature by any means but makes for good conversation when the gossiping starts around the coffee pot at work."
2,Simon House - 'Yassasim' (Griffin),"Never was all that thrilled about this disc by the Hawkwind/Bowie/High Tide/Third Ear Band violinist.I enjoyed his three Spiral Realms efforts MUCH better.Couple of tunes here that are fair to put in your home entertainment center every great now and then are the title track ""Yassasim"",the fifteen-minute ""Northlands"" and ""Neuroscape""."
1,How To Sell Your Album With Free Advertising,"(1) Make an album (2) Using either an alias or a buddy, flood amazon.com with 5-star ratings of your album. Apparently amazon.com exercises no editorial judgment of its reviews - after all, selling CDs, not objectivity, is amazon's goal. That makes it easy for you and/or your best buddy to make it seem as though your music is of 5 star quality. This album is a perfect example. The 5 star rating came from the same review sent in twice by the same person using an alias. ""Best Instrumental Album Ever""? Sure, if you ignore the several thousand albums of New Age music which are infinitely better. Compare this to instrumental music by Mike Oldfield, Mehdi, Jean-Michel Jarre, Jesse Cook, Ottmar Liebert, Chris Spheeris, even Yanni, to name only a few, and you'll see that there is no comparison. The music on this album is lackluster; the engineering, woeful. At best, the album merits one star for effort... and an honorable mention for the P.T. Barnum Award."
3,"Good look @ process of peace, but too early for real details","This book is an enjoyable read which will introduce you to all the major players in the negotiations that led to the Good Friday Peace Accords, and give a good sense of what the challenges were and how the various parties worked to overcome them.Unfortunately, it was probably too early for Mitchell to come out with any new details, and he is reluctant to be overly critical of any of the parties -- no doubt a wise move as the peace process contiues to move forward.Hopefully, we will see another account from Mitchell in the future which will give a little bit more bite in terms of how he really feels. In the mean time, this book is well worth the quick read."
3,Very dissapointing,"If you followed the peace negotiations while they were occuring, you really have no need of this book. Mitchell is frustratingly vague throughout, relating the negotiations in the most general of terms and not giving us much new insight. I don't think I learned anything about the negotiations from this book that I didn't already know. Vague and dry, read this book only if you didn't follow the peace negotiations at all."
4,Great for the price,"This is a good pan. It has metal handles, so you need to watch out because they get hot. I use it to pan-roast meats and I get pretty good fond considering it is a non-stick(ish) pan."
4,Handy pan - you'll use it everyday!,"I like this pan - use it almost everyday. It is a little lighter in weight, but that doesn't seem to hurt the performance at all. I reach for this pan almost everyday! It is wonderful for cooking eggs or whatever you want. Like all Circulon, there is no stick, even browning and wonderful cleanup! You just can't ask for more in cookware. The handles (do get hot-but not a problem for me) make it very convenient to use on the stovetop. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars was the handles that heat up."
2,"A good pan, but limited.","The product is fairly described as an ""open"" pan, but I find it to be difficult to use without a lid, and the 11-inch size makes it difficult to match a lid to it."
4,Does what it claims to do.,"Intermediate size is good for small dinners. Nonstick is nonstick. Light, but no issue with hotspots on a gas range. Left off a star because can't comment on durability, as we have only had it for a couple of weeks."
4,good,i bought 3 of these ones's for me and my friends. so far we are happy with this product.very good price.
3,You get the same info on Wikipedia,"First, I am not sure why my university instructor would pick this book for the Avionics Class. This book is only acceptable for high school level.I would say for an private pilot or technician, this colour/picture book would give them a good introduction to avionics.I've decided to keep this book rather than returning it because of the nice photos, it does serve as a quick reference if you need to look up an avionics acronym.3-stars because the title of the book is mis-leading. It should really be ""An Introduction to Communication and Navigation Avionics"""
2,Loud Motor,"The problem with this fountain is that the sound of the water pump is much louder than the actual trickling sound of the water. The orange light is a little annoying too. The fountain is made of cheap brown plastic -- so don't think you are adding much class to the decor of your home. All in all, it does not provide a very relaxing environment."
3,"Good Story, But A Bit Hard To Follow","The book jacket states that this is as good as ""In Cold Blood"" and ""The Executioner's Song.""I don't think this book is nearly as well written, although it is worth a read.As an American, I had a difficult time with the colloquialisms in the book; many times, the author quotes the people involved verbatim, and the way they speak bears very little resemblance to the English that I know. So that was a bit difficult.Overall, though, it's a compelling story of an ordinary man who sank to a level of depravity which is hard to comprehend."
4,I love Kay Hooper,Have read and enjoyed almost everything this lady writes. Started reading her in the Loveswept series and continue to this day. She has just the right touch of fantasy for my taste. And I_like_fantasy.
3,Whatever happened to the sketch?,"I found the book fair and a little above average for intensity. The ending seemed a bit rushed. Also, there was a part that someone took the sketch of Daniel and throughout the book I never heard of the missing sketch again."
3,Some parts compelling but other parts just dragged out.,"I was very disappointed in reading this latest book of Kay Hooper's. The ""mirror"" plot gets lost in Laura's subliminal description of the Kilbourne's house, gardens, maze, etc. Her relationship with Daniel was slow in developing without any background depth. Amelia's reference to Laura as ""Child"" was... At Amelia's age, every character was ""Child."" This book is the kind that turns me away from an otherwise favorite author and keeps me from buying future books."
4,Great book! I could not stop once I started.,"""Finding Laura"" is a great book. It is so intriguing and enticing that I read till 4 in the morning without knowing it. Now that I am almost close to finishing it, I started to worry where I can find another good book, or Kay Hooper to kill my commuting time.The book definitely has all the right elements to succeed. I think Kay Hooper has become one of my favorite authoresses."
3,"I enjoyed this book, but....","I must agree with the interviewers who called the characters flat and the pace dragging. The fun element, for me, was the supernatural twist, but even there, more could have been done with it."
5,A wonderfully romantic page-turner--don't miss it!,"I loved this book and can't believe I missed the hardcover release! I was totally intrigued by the set-up, the couple is sexy and fun, and this book kept me distracted from a very bumpy plane ride! The ultimate praise! Kay Hooper writes old-fashioned Gothics with a completely modern sensibility. Wonderful!"
3,a great book by Gary L. Blackwood,"I thought this was a really good book. It was fun and exciting to read . I just wish that a I can read it again and again. But the reason I rated 4 stars is because, well it was good and all, but the main character in the book made fun of the people living in the area of Chicago. I would recomend this book to anybody."
3,a nice toy for a toddler,"I agree with the former writer, this toy does not do alot.it *is* magnetic, though - but the magnets are not very strong.I think it is a nice toy for kids under the age of 2, they can move the cars around, lift and lower parts of the cars, a simple play."
2,What is the point,"Our son was excited to get this toy. The only problem is that the toy doesn't do anything. It appears that it is made to be magnetic, so that the boulders stick to the construction equipment. However, this is not the case. The boulders fall off of the trucks and serve no purpose. Would be a lot more fun if they could stick to the trucks."
4,sesame street construction playset,i found this set to be well made for a 2 year old except the crane with the string attached; i have twins and this piece made more for a weapon to hit the other with and the crane switch difficult for a two year old to do so i put it away until they are older.
4,My 22 Month old Loved these!,"When I opened the box, he was so excited. He has had a blast with them."
3,Only good for about 6 months...,"then the hanging clips will rust out. My bird loves this cup because it is big enough to bathe in (she's a green cheeks conure), but we've never had one last very long. They're cheep (ha ha), though so not a bad buy entirely."
1,Simply just bad story telling,Decent illustrations but story simply falls flat. Our daughter kept asking what the story was about and claiming that someone must have torn pages from the book. Nothing missing except the ability to tell a good story.
3,Not Just for HR Professionals,"I bought this book thinking that it would help me gain more knowledge into the HR field and that the sites mentioned in this book would be useful. I have found out more on my own. Several times throughout the book they state that it is not really useful for HR professionals, or not just for HR professionals, or that HR professionals should atleast give it a once over. This book does not give 100 websites for HR professionals, but for others as well, and a lot not relating to HR (Human Resources) at all."
1,great idea but poorly designed,"I bought this item a year ago. It is a very handy dictionary. Excellent idea, however its prroly designed. Keys get stuck, I kept a pin just to free the key. After two months it just died. I discovered a problem with battery case. It's a weird design. I suggest you wait for their better designed product. Check out their newer model FRA SCD1870 (Franklin Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Speaking Dictionary) It has a larger screen and hopefully better designed keys."
2,Disappointing...,"My dad bought me this dictionary for my schoolwork last year. I didn't know how he paid then. But I totally freaked out when saw its price. This does NOT worth $75! The screen is very small, and I always pressed the 2 letters at a time because the button were SO TINY! It's about a size of my pinky's nail! also it is BIG. It's not good for caring around. If you really need a electronic dictionary, i recommend Franklin MWD-1440 Dictionary. It might look kinda small and lame but it knows how to do its thing! I say it's way better than this one."
1,"Franklin goes backwards, the voice is worse then 15 years ago","I bought a similar product 15 years ago. The voice was much natural and pleasent to listen. Last year, I bought a new one, the voice is so electronic makes me sick. I called Franklin,""Shame on you at today's high tech era"".No more in my life. ever, never again."
1,franklin mws-1840,"this item is hard to see, upper line is partially hidden. do you have something larger and easier to read?"
5,Its really helpful,"I bought this for my mum as she is restudying english and subjects, she found this extremely helpful with pronoucing words and understanding words she didnt know how to spell properely. The only thing is that the speakers voice is quite hard to make out, she has no problem with it but i personally don't understand what it says.I guess its up to personal skill?Its still helpful though."
2,"Only 120,000 definitions","... said that the Franklin 1840 had over 274,00 ""comprehensive and contemporary"" definitions. When I received the machine the Franklin paperwork that came with it said that the 1840 had 120,000 definitions. I verified that it was the 1840. Here's a couple of words that I couldn't find: Anomie, Fungible. Also, the ""learn"" key got stuck in the pressed position and prevented all the other functions from working until it was discovered."
3,evaluation,It is good in so many aspects but 2 things need to be improved1- the quality of voice2-screen display (PROBABLY NEED TO BE DARKER DISPLAY WITH AN OPTION OF SCREEN LIGHT)Dr. M.G. SAYED
1,Junk!!! I would give Zero star if I could,"I could not believe such low quality and bulky design of the dictionary when I received it. I bought it for my kid to check definition and pronunciation. It did not work well from day 1. Keys were stuck all time and turn off every moment when you have slight motion or shaking. I fixed the battery cover to solve part of the problem. After 9 months, it died finally.This is a piece of junk. Do not waste your money and time on it.On the other hand, shopping on Amazon is always super."
2,MWS1840 gives poor pronunciation,"When it comes to the English language, the most important aspect is the pronunciation. This is where I focus now. In general, the pronunciation of this unit is not too bad, but there are words that are mispronounced; for example, the word ""spank"" is pronounced as ""stank"" - this is unacceptable. Another area of concern is that the pronouncer in this unit uses ""monophthong"", so much so that in certain words diphthongs are minimized to an extent that it is inaudible. This report comes from the first critical examination. There are six more critical examinations. At this point, I would not suggest anyone to buy this product."
3,learn spanish,I need to learn spanish because i go to baja Mx. every year. This is a good tool to have. you can type in a word and right away it will say it for you in spanish. The only down side is the voice is a bit hard to understand. It is also A bit confusing to operate. but after a while you can get it. A bit expense for what it does those
3,More Information about It,I'd like more detail about Franklin MWS-1840 Speaking Merriam Webster Dictionary and Thesaurus by Franklin Electronics.Coult you tell me a phone number to help me?ThanksVanderlei
3,Fourth Franklin,"This is a good product with limited durability. My earlier versions with fewer words came with a protective cover and seemed to be veritably indestructable. My last one lasted a couple of months before it bit the dust. I said I would never buy another one, however, here I am ordering another one to see if I have better luck."
1,What just happened?,"This movie marks the one (and only time) that I have ever listened to a certain co-worker when picking a movie. Craziness and the inability to follow a plot does NOT make a movie a classic. It makes it garbage . . . And this movie certainly fits that term.I STILL don't know what happened. I've since read online reviews that tried to explain it, but I don't see how they are coming up with their opinions. If a movie requires massive amounts of discussion just to figure out what happened, then this is a DOWNFALL! Come on, people! How can anybody give this movie TWO stars, let alone FIVE?!And, about twenty minutes before the end, the movie goes from being an impossible to follow mystery . . . to a PORN flick! I know that this made the move more ""watchable"" to some people, but, in my opinion, it caused even more deterioration to a movie that I had thought couldn't deteriorate any further."
2,"Trust me, its all about weird sex!","Just consider this movie without its lesbian hazy shadow and without the stunning offensive few shots of the amazingly sexy Laura Harring: the movie is not worth watching at all. It is nothing like Blue Velvet, Leaving Las Vegas or Pulp Fiction (real Noir and Mayhem).I strongly believe it is only these shots of naked extreme beauty calling for weird sex that entice the viewer to see the movie repeatedly. You may notice from the reviewers that everybody saw it more than once."
3,"Love the taste of it, but left out by the director","Ok, I have to admit that I did like the atmosphere of this movie and excitement I got from the first half of the movie, which made me want to figure out what is actually going on or has gone on. However, the movie failed to satisfy me after it started showing what actually happened (or did it?). But I was still not sure what actually happened. Even though I would think the director did not mean to show that to ME, I could not stop feeling left out by the director in the end."
2,A film in search for an ending.,"...Forget the mystery, Mulholland Dr is about the character development of an innocent and pretty girl from rural Ontario who turns into a lascivious lesbian lover. Her object of affection is an auburn haired beauty that is suffering from amnesia (so much for avante garde story telling) and obviously in some trouble. The film starts with a relatively sound theme of suspense, and this is the story line that is never developed. There are numerous outtakes (for lack of a better description), which are quite audacious, sharp and theatrical. The acting is good. The ending confirms what you might suspect mid way through the film that the whole thing is dysfunctional. And just in case you aren't aware of the genre the ending fades to black, really."
1,Whoa,"I'm sorry for all you people that liked this, but to me it was extremely boring and the meaning is DEEP. SO deep that half-way through the movie i said ""What is going on? and, is it over yet?"" I don't not like writing negative reviews, but this is just my feeling. If i were you, I would save myself the money (renting,buying) and the TIME, and find someting more interesting to watch."
2,Mulholland Drive is a train wreck,"I loved this film in the theatre. Actually, I hated it the first time, figured it out the second time, and loved the third viewing. So I was excited to hear it would be available on DVD so soon. I bought it the day it was released, raced home, got my wife and son tucked into bed, and sat down to watch it. NO CHAPTERS!!! Thanks a lot Universal. Come on, that is for cheap DVDs, not a great film from a reputable company. Its an art film. Why no commentary? Why no extras? Shame on you for taking advantage of the filmgoers who loved this film. This is a renter at best. Wait a few months for a deluxe edition that had better come out.Steve"
2,David Lynch's great folly,"Isn't it possible that all the ""mysterious"" and unexplainable plot twists in Mulholland Drive really are just a result of having to slap together a feature film ending on a tv series pilot? Lynch sets in motion many intriguing sub-plots and characters in the first half of the film, which is very watchable, in my opinion. But then the film unravels, and in effect forgets itself, which is very unsatisfying. The care with which these characters, even the minor ones, are introduced, makes the finale seem unfair. I wanted more...as in a whole season of episodic television, which is obviously what Lynch had in mind. I've read a lot of intricate analyses of this film, and I keep thinking it is all one huge case of ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", with David Lynch having a laugh at all the film ""experts"" who see brilliant symbolism and metaphor instead of a naked failed tv pilot."
1,CRAZY!!!!!!,"Ok im so confused on how this movie got five stars by EBERT!!!! from the Chicago sun times i was like wow! I rented the movie on DVD and was trying to stay awake. The movie is a complete mess! it really dosent make sense to me. I tried and tried to make sense of it but i really couldnt. Ebert said that the whole movie is a dream, but still its really boring and stupid and the lesbian sex scenes really didnt have to be in the movie....lol then ending was totaly confusing, and i couldnt wait till the movie was OVER!!! but i guess the only pro i can give the movie is the way it is visualy but thats about it. I wouldnt recomend it to anyone......really!"
3,The lack of Special features is intentional.,"Many [people] have complained that the DVD of Mulholland DR. doesn't have chapter breaks and a director's commentary.Well, it's intentional. David Lynch doesn't like Chapter breaks, so none of his DVDs have them. He wants you to sit down and watch the whole movie, from beginning to end.The movie doesn't have a director's commentary, because Lynch wants you to figure out for yourself what the movie is about."
4,"This movie sucks you in, you cant stop watching...........",..........and you will try to analysis over and over in your head. Most of the movie until the box is opened is a dream. Notice the camera work till then.........its kind of floats like a dream. A movie you cannot stop watching and will want to watch again. And Watts is beautiful.
3,Wasn't really for me.,"Well what can I say. Right off the bat, watching the movie, I had a very strong sense of watching Twin Peaks, mostly due to atmosphere. I haven't seen any other David Lynch movies, so it could just be his style. I really didn't like the movie for the first 2 hours. Was like a cheap episode of Murder She Wrote. However, once you get to the last half-hour, you see it was that way on purpose. Can't say I enjoyed it anymore knowing this. So why more then 1star? Well, I do like movies that are different. This is defiantly not what it seems, and you have to watch it more then once to get a better understanding of what you just saw.All in all, I wouldn't add it to my collection, but it is worth seeing. I'd say rent it as a 7day rental, that will give you time to dwell on it, and rewatch it a few times. Once done with it tho, I don't have the desire to see it again."
5,Listen to your mother - a dietary fable.,"It may have taken him a while to come to a fully formed interpretation, but Sticky has emerged with a sound appreciation of the allegorical nature of Lynch's Mulholland Drive.At its core, the film bears witness to the importance of proper eating habits - choosing food judiciously, chewing carefully, and digesting properly. Clearly the free-wheeling nightmare endured by Diane in the first half of the film is induced by the following chain of events:- big session of sticky rice eating- heavy session of wild jitterbugging!- huge cat napThere is a lesson for us all here...Note to self: go easy on the dance floor."
3,Mulholand Drive,"This movie is Lynch at his best! I would have rated it a 5 if it wasn't for the DVD's lack of special features. One major problem is there is no chapter selection. After viewing this film 5 times already, I have become a little irritated by the fact that I cannot view particular scenes in a non-linear breakdown. If figuring out this movie is important to you this feature would of been nice to have. Also, it would of been nice to have a making of or interview session with the cast. Besides that the visual and audio quality are great. In the same tradition as Lost Highway Lynch has created a masterpiece that will be anaylized for the rest of time. Definately a classic. Buy it now!! I'm just waiting now for Lost Highway on DVD...whatz up?"
5,A dream inside a dream!,"This movie is fascinating, beautiful, scarey, funny, creepy and wonderful. So much of Lynch's work worms its way into your subconscious and this movie is no exception. I think he's gotten more subtle in doing this over the years, making the movies less squirmy to sit through, but the images are there in your mind as from a dream. Your brain gets a nice workout mulling over the various people and incidents, trying to fit the whole thing together. Just when you think you have it figured out, something else pops up and you have to start all over. I loved the cinematography. The limo driving through the dark road was wonderful. The acting was amazing. I didn't even realize at first that Naomi Watts was in both sides of the story, she morphed so completely. Great movie!"
5,"The dream, the nightmare","What is it all about? Can you know? Does it matter? An important film, one of those that is timely and hits a nerve, the right nerve that makes a lasting impression. This is the stuff of dreams. And dreams it seems to be about, the kind you have when you are asleep, the kind you have no control over, the kind that dominate your waking life, the dreams for success, and where does a dream become a nightmare?Great acting, great achetypal characters - the director, the cowboy, and the women, mysterious dual-natured women, a theme present in mythology throughout time. And this film is like a mythology for today: the mythology of movie making and the Hollywood star, and the money and sex that runs the machine. Sensual, visual, stunning score and cinematograpy, a cinematic opera. A film that exists somewhere in the unconscious, a place where David Lynch makes himself at home, a master of the film medium."
5,Give in to it - it doesn't have to make immediate sense,"David Lynch is his own man and he is unafraid to put out films that are untouched reruns of his own wild imagination. MULHOLLAND DRIVE drives some people crazy because of their need for absolute resolution of stories. This little gem of a film is more like a carefully staged stream of consciousness and if you can't jump on the ride then you're missing the joy. Lynch has captured fine performances from a strong cast, explores terrain rich and strange, and even goes over the edge just enough to test our thinking and conceptual skills. The ending is up to the viewer.......and what a refreshing turn for a film to take! Give in to it. The DVD allows you to see it at home where you don't need to fret that people around you may think you confused."
3,Another odd movie from David Lynch,"I know, a lot of people think this is a really great movie, but I just couldn't buy into it. I liked ""Twin Peaks"" a lot, but mostly Lynch's stuff leaves me cold. Too often, he just seems to be doing weirdness for weirdness' sake... leading the audience around by the nose, only to have the nose disappear at the end. The production is nice, in a moody way, and Laura Harring is certainly gorgeous, but that's not enough to salvage the movie. In the end, you don't know what really happened ... and you don't care.Shortly after watching this, I watched ""Vanilla Sky,"" which is similar in some ways, but a much better movie in my opinion. I'm giving this one 3 stars for originality and high-grade production, but its structural flaws preculde rating it higher."
2,"First two thirds were good, but then...","The first two thirds of this movie were very suspenseful, but the last third really ruins it. To date, I have not been a David Lynch fan and now I know why.The last third of this movie did not seem to have any connection whatsoever with the rest of the film. Same cast, but different characters and a different story. It didn't make any sense to me and I didn't see any resolution to the story by the film's end.There's a scene just before the movie takes a dive, where the two lead actresses are watching a woman sing a Roy Orbison tune in Spanish and they start crying. I think the real reason they started crying was because they figured out they were in a movie that was about to tank.For the David Lynch fans, if you enjoyed this film (and understood it), more power to you. I, however, did not."
5,good movie,"Do not be afraid of this movie as a result of the bad reviews.. this is a great movie. Most of the Bad reviews are from folks who think they are joe pro movie and don't like lynch, my question to them: If you know good movies so well why are writing comments on amazon and Lynch is directing major films. To have a cult following like Lynch you gotta be doing something right. Lynch films are not for everyone, but don't let some arrogant person's negative feedback keep you from this movie."
5,Wow,"I don't think I've ever been as confused by a movie as Mulholland Drive, but that was it initially made me watch it again. Preconceptions I had disappeared after repeated viewings and the plot started to come together through the various scenes that seem to have no connections.Naomi Watts' pretentious performance I originally saw as bad acting, but now realize is exceptional acting. This is what her role called for and makes complete sense after repeated viewings.While the plot can not simply be explained to a viewer, he or she must make his or her own mind up about what this film is saying. I don't have a clear cut answer, but the movie is a manifestation of romance, comedy, drama, mystery, and sadness. David Lynch's direction is Oscar deserving.A great, great film."
5,The best movie I've ever seen!,"In my opinion this is by far the greatest David Lynch movie I've seen and I've seen all of them.It's a bit similar to Lost Highway in some areas, but then suddenly when you thought you had it figured out, Lynch completely twists your brain in about 2 minutes of unbelievable turn-arounds and riddles.I've only watched it once so there's still alot of things I simply don't understand. I will defenetly see this one again, and again....Everything about this movie is great, every scene has that Lynch feel to it and the music/atmosphere through the whole thing is just perfect.I only wish the movie had been longer. I also think this would be a great TV series, but maybe we'll get a ""Mulholland Drive part 2...?""The movie is filled with riddles, twists and turns, weird and scary characters (The Cowboy...)I think this is maybe the greatest movie I've ever seen.Well done Mr. Lynch!"
1,Great Movie.. DVD [stink]s..,"Movie is really great.. But DVD [stink]s.. There are no Chapters, no special features. if you want to go to a scene in the dvd you have to rewind/FF, just like as you do in VHS. Don't waste your money in buying this dvd, buy VHS instead."
2,"Ok, so its not just me","I too was also concerned to find that I couldn't skip around between scenes. I thought it was just my copy. Luckily it isn't, but unfortunatly the DVD is far from what I expected. With all the mind games that is played in the movie I expected the DVD to contain some mindblowing extras. Instead I found nothing. The movie I give 5 stars...the DVD I give 2. It would have only been 1 star if there hadn't been ""David Lynch's Ten Clues to Unraveling the Mystery"" in the sleeve."
3,"Some of the worst aspects of the medium, but still Lynch","Lynch has difficulty telling a straight story, if you pardon the pun. I don't mind time-bending storylines (""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Memento"") but they have to have an underlying, live plot, as opposed to images, mood and style. And the film was too long and too self-involved.What do I mean by ""self-involved""? I'm tired of books about authors (""Wonderboys""), plays about stage performers (""Noises Off""), songs about musicians (""Faithfully"") and most of all, films about actors. Quit getting off on yourselves for once. Why three stars? Because Lynch is Lynch. Who else could give you characters like the Cowboy and the Incompetent Hitman?"
3,"""I am David Lynch.""","I saw you holding this movie in your hand. Your dress was the color of scarlet...You let the DVD case fall to the floor. I picked it up...Someone whispered in another room, ""Is he here yet?""I said ""No, sir, I am not."" But they couldnt hear.Whose glove is that? It lays crumpled on the mattress.The same mattress we made love on, but only once.'Am I going to recognize you, then, when the time comes?'I dont know, perhaps you will. But take this, my review of Mulholland Drive.It may or may not bring you luck."
1,Worst movie i have ever seen,Watched this looking for the great movie heralded by reviews and was greatly disappointed. Pointless waste of time. You can do better...with ANYTHING else.
5,The others ;),Here is a clue that very few have been able to find even though it has alway's been there :)In Club Silencio notice the other attendees...Now who do they all look like? lol! DAVID IS A GENIUS!
4,Dangerous encounters,"This is a real suspense film. It is a good example of Alfred Hithcock the master of suspense version. When Diane has the car accident at the beginning of the movie, she acts as a somnambulate person. Naomi Watts plays the role of Betty beautifully, and Laura Harring's performance as Rita's partnerwas convinced. These two women involves in a dangerous romance with noting to left to the imagination as the sex scenes takes action. Other scenes really horror us, these takes place in the office apartment when the murder shoots the old man and a fat woman was in a fierce battle with the murder and was shoot too. He shoots the retarded janitor, to make a triple murder.The drama was intense and must be viewed more than once. This is really a suspense drama with an unexpected end."
2,David Lynch Finally Gives Us An Ending. But Not A Middle!,"After Lost Highway I had almost given up. Remembering Fire Walk With Me, however, I gave Mulholland Dr. a shot. I should have remembered that Fire was a prequel to a series that went nowhere. Although Lynch must have felt a need to get an ending that made sense this time, he for some reason didn't feel a need to make a movie that makes sense most of the way through. Yes, the larger parts do tie together in the end, although hardly everything does. But just because the puzzle is difficult does not mean there's much joy in solving it -- the payoff, though eerie, was just too long in getting there, and the story too sloppy, and with too many never-explained turn, events, and whole characters, to warrant much interest. David Lynch, I see that you're trying, and I wish you the best, but that's the last time I plunck down my money to see one of your pictures. Ugh."
5,Amazing,"This film is phenomenal. The first time I watched it I was very confused but once I figured it out I realized how innovative it really is. This is definitely one of the best films I've seen in quite some time.When watching this film, one needs to approach with an open mind. Many closed-minded people will watch once, say it's garbage because they didn't understand it, and never think twice to see what it's really about.You don't have to try and be artsy or sophisticated to enjoy this film you just need to think. If you don't particularly enjoy movies that make you think, this isn't for you! But for those that like a film that challenges you, this is a must-see."
1,Clueless,"After the film ended my wife and I looked at each other and said ""What the [heck]! was that about?"" It was 2 hours of aimless incoherent ramblings. The ten clues included in the DVD case didn't help at all. Watching it three or four more times may help but I doubt it. The only memorable moment was an excellent Spanish version of Roy Orbison's ""Crying""."
3,Mulholland Drive,"This was an OK movie....rather difficult to get through at times, losing my attention. I liked it, but am glad that I did not pay to see it in a theater"
2,Good movie but poor DVD realization.,I liked the movie but found the lack of scene selection deplorable. Avoid purchasing this product in favor of a realization that has the movie broken up into scenes. I wonder why this feature was not included.
3,Manic indeed,This is a movie that must be watched more than once to be able to understand all that is going on. Pay close attention to names. Watch it and then let lots of time go by and then watch it again. I found a few other reviews helpful as well.
1,"Bad, bad...","After reading all those good critic reviews I decided to the film. I tell you it one waste of my time and money (thanks to God I didn't buy the tape I just rented it- still a buck is a buck). The movie starts so well - crime, suspence, a little detective story. What the hell happened after the scene in the theatre? I didn't understand a single thing.I am sure that I will never watch any of Lynchs films, never."
1,Horrible,This movie is quite simply the most horrible waste of time movie I've ever seen.It is boring as hell and quite hard to understand.-RoNNY
1,Rubbish,There was no car chases or big explosions. Very bad movie. The ending was not that happy either and it was not a real feel good movie. Where was the hero? Or the love story. Not as good as a Sandra Bullock movie.
3,David Lynch is on crack.,"I'm so sick of people ranting and raving about David Lynch movies, jumping on the bandwagon about the ""experience"" and how epic his movies are. Aside from the constant lesbian action, DAVID LYNCH IS AWFUL!This movie is yet another twisted, unclear, freak show brought to you by David Lynch, who also did that series that I never understood called ""Twin Peaks"". I sat through this movie confused, unclear, and bored.First it's a girl in an accident, then no memory, then dyking it out. I'll tell you this however, the only reason this movie scored points with me is because the main character was GORGEOUS. There's a bunch of topless lesbian scenes where you're blown away by that figure, but beyond that, the blond girl was stupid, and who the hell was the cowboy? I gave it a 3."
3,Loved the Movie - Where is the DVD value?,"This is one of the very few movies I ever felt compelled to watch twice in one night. So, why not give it five stars? The move deserves the five stars, the DVD does not.The DVD has essentially no value added material. It should be priced accordingly, yet it carries a premium equal to other new, popular, full featured DVDs.Just a plea for rational pricing."
5,WATCH IT TWICE!!!,"A few reviews have called this ""unexplainable."" Nonsense. It's perfectly explainable, you just have to THINK ABOUT IT. This isn't a julia roberts movie - lynch doesn't explain every step of the plot as it happens, but rather he lets the viewer draw his or her own conclusions. It's a bit like visual poetry in that respect. Like i said in the title you really need to watch it twice to get the twist (and there is one, he hasn't just jumbled together random scenes as some reviews seem to suggest). If you've already seen it and are a little confused watch the opening 5 minutes again VERY CLOSELY, remembering that what's on screen throughout the movie isn't necessarily reality. If you get it watch Lost Highway, which for me is even better."
1,WHY A LYNCH FAN GIVES THIS DVD 1 STAR.,"I'll keep it brief... you either LOVE this movie or HATE it. I love it.Having said that, not only does this DVD have just about no extras, but the entire movie seems to be presented in JUST ONE CHAPTER. You cannot skip between SCENES! You cannot skip to your favorite Lynchian moments (cowboy) or dialogue (napkin)! The disc is DTS and 5.1! It's WIDESCREEN ANAMORPHIC! It is ONE HUGE SCENE! What is going on? I forgot how to fast forward the day I threw out my VCR, and I thanked god I did.Universal DVDs tend to look pretty and sound good with zero extras, but this is really absurd. I GIVE THE MOVIE 5 STARS BECAUSE I LOVE IT, AND -4 STARS BECAUSE I WANT TO EDUCATE CONSUMERS on this less-than-spectacular DVD.Finally, if this is the way David intended his film to be shown, then I think he's way off the mark in terms of the medium; which is odd, because davidlynch.com is so wonderful.If just my DVD has this problem, please let me know."
1,Stale,"A return to the Lynch-canon in the worst way: a bunch of recycled old motifs waiting hopelessly for a clue, plus a bugaboo round the corner. By the way, arbitrariness is just not art. With films like this David Lynch surely is a director for the intellectually immature."
1,Worst. Movie. EVER.,"Typical David Lynch...is he paying the critics to write positive reviews for his disjointed, badly played bits of weirdness?"
2,Mulhollow Dr,"I have always been a fan of independent movies and especially of films that are thought provoking. I can then say I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. Now I'm wishing I hadn't. I did enjoy Mr Lynch's talents as a director, however I cannot say the same about his writting.I have had conversations with many people about this movie... and while the most common answers are ""It was cool"" or ""It was weird"", no one has been able to clearly explain the plot or the last half of the movie... I can say I did understand most of Lynch's symbolism but overall I feel alot of it was unrelated to the movie and added simply to leave the viewer wondering about their relevance.I really consider this movie nothing more than a snowjob with some great camera work. I know many won't agree with me, but I don't think everything that cannot be understood can be called art. If this were the case I could be the next Picasso."
3,Too Deep,"Wow. This movie had so many interesting parts, but it failed to all come together like in the really great movies by this director that my professor made us watch: Blue Velvet, Lost Highway, Elephant Man, and even Eraserhead (which I got during the class discussion, but did not get, to be honest, when I first watched it). Now I know all of the symbolic things that were going on, picked up a few as I watched it, picked up the rest during class discussion, but as a movie there were too many subplots he edited in just because they were cool. The one that really angered me (despite its symbolic value) was the Cowboy; he was so interesting and had so much promise, but as far as the film was concerned, he was outside the plot and therefore superfluous. The thing that saved the movie, was the lesbian sex. Those scenes were hot. Sent me to the shower. I watched them numerous times long after the class had ended, and you will too. It's why I bought the DVD despite not LOVING the film."
2,Don't waste 2 and a half hours.,"It's movies like these that ruin it for the rest. David Lynch brings us another story that should make sense but screws you over for the 45 minutes. The movie was good for the first 90 minutes(believe it or not), but it seems as if this wierdo director tries to confuse his audiences so that they'll end up thinking that it is good and then they'll buy it. Not only that but this is an absolutely horrible DVD release. Only a trailer and Cast & Crew info! This also has to be a first for a DVD that doesn't have any chapter stops. I heard Lynch purposely did that and will be doing it for all of his other movies. The 3-second car crash is all that I enjoyed. If you liked this hunk-o-junk then see Lost Highway, it's basically the same Lynch [stuff]."
2,A Real Head Scratcher,"First off, the DVD does not have chapters. Took me a while to figure that out. Second of all, I really just didn't get it. This film is so obviously Lynchian, in all it's twists and memory erasing turns. I suppose I didn't like it simply because I didn't get it, that may seem like a bad reason but it's true. Some of the moments were worth seeing, the Silencio sequence, but most was just a bunch of hooey. I felt as if I needed Cliffs notes to figure out what really went on. The performances were quite good, and it looked really great, with great direction by Lynch, but in the end, I just didn't get it!"
1,Lynch's approach: how can I salvage this mess?,"It started as a TV pilot. Lynch apparently pasted together nearly 2 hours of miscellany from Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, and Twin Peaks: Long, pointless (dreamlike) shots with low moaning backgroun noise/music; eccentric characters for the point of eccentricity; horrible dialogue; cute, guileless people naively dragged into a seamy other world; lip-synched saccharine 50s tunes; Roy Orbison tunes resurrected to portray deep anguish. Absolutely nothing new or cohesive.When it wasn't picked up, knowing that he never intended to reach closure on the story, he used the oldest trick in the book: aha! It's a dream sequence! The last half-hour is interesting, but let's not fool ourselves. This is a (mostly) good half-hour art movie, not a great 2-1/2 hour motion picture."
1,Stupid movie.,"I read the glowing reviews about this movie, I remember David Lynch's other works (""Twin Peaks"", ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Wild at Heart""), and since I grew up in L.A. just off Mulholland Drive, I bought the DVD despite my personal rule of never buying a DVD without seeing the movie first. **HUGE MISTAKE!** While this film may be very artsy, the story is disjointed and just plain wierd. Yes, I 'got it' - the plot is basically a dream sequence. I feel like I wasted not only the money I spent on the DVD, but -more importantly- 2.5 hours of my life watching it. I have since sold this DVD. In my humble opinion, this is an awful, terrible movie. It is a complete waste of time and money. Don't bother."
1,"No Scene Selection, No Stars!","I generally like Lynch's work, but I never thought I'd see a feature film on DVD that didn't have a basic Scene Selection menu! I fell asleep trying to watch this movie twice, and had to fast-forward forever just to find where I left off. Lynch probably thought this would be funny..."
1,WARNING: May cause symptoms of drug-induced coma.,"I have David Lynch completely figured out. His whole intention in film-making is simply to throw every Freudian cliche, nightmarish symbol, and bizarre twist that he can dream up into a pot, thereby creating a confounding stew that even he doesn't understand, because there's nothing TO understand.This product is then marketed to an ersatz intellectual audience who debate and decipher all sorts of meaning out of this stream-of-consciousness mess, while Lynch laughs at his audience...all the way to the bank. Ludicrous, but true.This is the most accurate, in-a-nutshell review of ""Mulholland Drive"" you may ever read."
1,...and I thought watching Fantasia 1000 times was boring,"You know the scene, your kids insist on watching Fantasia over and over again. You try to justify this to your brain for its classical, experimenting artsy-fartsy appeal, but nothing can be as boring and unsatisfying as Mulholland Dr.Formula for a guaranteed boring movie: dragging out almost every scene, subplots in the film that are better left on the edit room floor and an ending that demands the two and half hours of your life back. This film had it all!"
3,Style Triumphs over Substance,"David Lynch is a genius as a stylist. It's unfortunate that he uses that genius to no purpose. (A lot like 19th century American painter John Singer Sargent). ""Mulholland Drive"" looks good and has good artistic manners, but as anyone who has dated knows, that doesn't mean that there is anything upstairs. There is nothing to get. Like other Lynch movies, symbols (such as the cube & its odd key) are introduced and developed well - up to the point when the director is obliged to reveal and illuminate. Then, he drops the ball. Viewers who can get happily drunk on style will be satiated. Viewers who expect to learn something about moral imperative and the human condition (arguably the key function of art) will wonder why the bother."
4,ONE MOVIE TWO DREAMS,"THERE IS ONLY ONE ""REAL"" SCENE, THE ONE WITH THE TWO MEN IN THE COFFEE SHOP. THE ONE MAN TELLS THE OTHER THAT HE HAS TWICE HAD A DREAM THAT STARTS WITH THE OTHER MAN STANDING AT THE COUNTER IN THE SAME COFFEE SHOP. THE OTHER MAN GETS UP AND WALKS OUT OF THE SCENE. THE MAN WITH THE DREAMS TURNS AND SEES THE OTHER MAN AT THE COUNTER WERE THE DREAM BEGINS. THE MOVIE IS AN INTERWEAVING OF THE TWO SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE SAME REACURRING DREAM."
3,No Chapters,"Great movie, dubious DVD. I thought my disc was defective until a friend told me David Lynch didn't want chapter divisions on this DVD, which is very annoying for those of us who want examine a scene more closely, or show a friend."
4,"""Superficial, psychotic...everyday L.A.""","I guess I should say I love freaky shows. Fight Club, Memento, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Basketball Diaries, Requiem for a Dream, Magnolia, Vanilla Sky, Eyes Wide Shut, Texas Chainsaw Massacre...You get the point. I could care less about the twists, this is a cool flick. I've only seen it once so far, but it's one I'll watch again. David Lynch must be one of the directors from another planet. David Fincher is in the same vein. The freakier, the better. I've never seen Blue Velvet, or the film starring Nicolas Cage. After watching Mulholland Drive I'll be more aware of this awesome director!"
5,This movie is awesome!,"I love thought-provoking movies. There are many interpretations that can come from this, but I wanted to share my own without giving much of the movie away. I was thinking about ""Silencio"". Actors can play many different parts. Movies in themselves are not real, but the actors can portray events that really did happen. Actors take on many names. I do not believe in the dream interpretation for this reason. This is definitely a movie that you must watch more than once to fully be able to appreciate."
5,Movie is great -- DVD has flaws,"This was a complex movie requiring several viewings to unravel the clues and solve the puzzle. The movie is more along the line of Blue Velvet rather than The Straight Story (both directed by David Lynch). However, I found the DVD rather disappointing. There was no way to access individual Chapters to go to exact sections of the movie. It ran just like a VHS tape. To return to a spot, you must actually put the DVD on rewind. Further the DVD has a bad flaw. It stops suddenly after about 90 minutes. Since there are no Chapters, it's not possible to simply jump to the next Chapter. After much trial and error, we figured out we start the DVD from the beginning at fast speed until it fast forwarded past the stopped area. I returned the DVD twice for a new copy; all 3 copies have this flaw, so it must have been manufactured that way. The DVD is pricey and has no extras except for Cast bios."
2,I think.....................................................,"Everyone is dead and in hell. The guy behind Winkies is the gatekeeper. It all starts in the 40s. Who in this day and age names their kids ""Betty"" or ""Rita""? Don't try to read into the movie."
2,garbage,"Aside from the obligatory sex scenes, this movie had few redeeming qualities. There was no plot, and the director's probably laughing at all the people who claim to have found one. I've watched this movie twice. The second time was with someone who claimed that they ""got it"". I could see the symbolism, but why go to that much trouble to hide a story?"
2,"Why can't all Lynch movies be like ""Dune""?","This movie is inscrutable. Watts' performance is its high point. See ""The Ring"" for a more tolerable dose of this fine and pretty actress. The sexual encounter in the bed midway through was so predictable and obvious that I could not wait for it to be over. That goes for the whole picture as well. To make matters worse-- when I went to use the chapter search function to review a few of the more bizarre sequences-- I was surprised to find this disc has NO CHAPTER SEARCH. I recommend ""Dune"" instead. While allowing director Lynch to have his usual type of fun being weird, it is more entertaining than this one."
3,OK,"Not great; not awful. Glad I didn't pay to see it in the theater. Frankly, I expected better from Lynch."
1,Not Very Good!!,"I think I watched this movie for approximately 30 minutes before I then turned it off. I really could not get into it. I was lost.I bought the DVD, but decided to rent the movie and watch it first...I'm glad that I did. I returned the un-opened DVD the next day.I know that some people said it was great, but in my opinion it wasn't. If a movie doesn't grab me in the first few scenes or at least in the first 30 minutes, then forget it."
3,"5 Stars for the Film, but the DVD has a Couple of Problems","The film is great. Read the other reviews for testimonials. There were two things which disappointed me about this dvd: 1) there are no chapter stops. Not one. I understand the argument of how the movie should be viewed in its entirety and all, but, practically, it's very annoying. 2) one scene has been censored, resulting in some very obvious blurring. There are, of course, no extras besides the trailer, but I guess that's pretty standard for Lynch. We're just lucky it's on dvd."
5,Among Lynch's best,"I was a bit disappointed when I realized that there was nothing special about the DVD, but I could not make myself give it a 4 star rating because the movie is so good. Make sure your television is set up for a proper picture (ie brightness isn't too high) and enjoy."
4,Different people have different tastes,"I personally like the movie. The acting is good. However, the DVD itself doesn't contain much extras."
4,Great movie,"I love this movie, but there are no chapters (thats why 4 stars). Maybe they are hidden (like some features in Blue Velvet DVD), so if someone find out how to find them, HELP US :o). Without chapters DVD edition doesn't make sence. So good luck with fast forwarding..."
2,Disappointing Second Half,"I really wanted to like this film, but as happens in about half of his films, David Lynch gets too frustrating/confusing for me.On the plus side, the entire film features great cinematography, and the first half of the film builds a storyline that keeps my interest.Sadly, the second half of the film self-destructs in a ball of confusion that makes the ending of 2001: A Space Odyssey seem clear in comparison."
2,Negative,"Let's say one did not know that this movie was supposed to be by a famous highly-respected director. If I had seen this movie at a student film festival or something, it would have struck me as being a very dull, unoriginal story of depressing things in general, but told by someone who was egotistical to the point of disregarding the audience, and so pumped with hallucinogens that they couldn't even keep their characters straight. Yes, the actors change who they play for no obvious reason. Go figure. There are also mini elf-people, a guy dressed in a bigfoot costume (I'm not joking), and a million-hour-long rehearsal of Sole Mio which ends in the singer dying or something. Essentially, the movie is pointless and random, as well as painfully long. If there is a meaning, well, one must ask if a meaning so cryptic it's undecipherable is really a meaning at all."
5,Mind Bender,"This is the first david lynch film I have seen, and I loved it!Watched it once - couldn't stop thinking about it and trying to figure it out, watched it a second time - my own theory began to evolve. Watched it a third time - and am just amazed at the mind of david lynch. I will definetly be watching this and more of his movies again!! The Actors also gave an amazing performance!"
4,A Good Movie to Mess with your Head,This movie is seems normal throughout the beginning scenes. But since the director is David Lynch I knew it would not be for long. Naomi Watts plays Betty a sweet girl from Canada. When she finds Rita played by Laura Elena Harring. They try to find out who Rita really is. A lot of other stuff happens im not going to give anything away. I will tell you this if you understand the ending you are a genius!
4,Definitely not for all tastes,"Typically weird, but exciting and absorbing Lynch film which is definitely one of his finest achievements yet. The ""story"" is roughly about wannabe actress Watts who heads to her aunt's apartment in Hollywood with vague hopes of making it big, only to become twisted in a labyrinth murder mystery with amnesiac Harring. This somehow coincides with the life of over-ambitious filmmaker Theroux who's battling to get control over his big project from mysterious mob group. Only a filmmaker with the passion to explore the unknown like Lynch can effectively interweave unusually complex stories like these and emerge with such a compelling piece of cinema that becomes so intriguingly bizarre that (just like many of his other films) it actually works. Try asking David Lynch what really happened."
1,Deeeeep nonsense!,"I rarely walk out of a movie...I did with this one! It is totally BORING! People can wax philisophically about the deeeeep meanings but it is simply rubbish! Yes, the ladies are pretty and sexy, but you can get that from a whole lot of good movies, why waste your time with nonsense!"
2,What is the point of the sex scenes?,"This is a film that I am almost sorry I watched. It is disjointed and confusing, which by itself would be okay because it does make some sense when you realize it is a dream until the last part of the movie. What is disturbing to me is that this film has unnecessary scenes, which, as far as I am concerned, are pornographic and don't add anything to the movie. In fact they take away from it. They seem to be included for sensationalism and to satisfy some sick fantasy. Otherwise the dream symbolism, the way Lynch has used stiff seemingly bad acting on the part of the characters in the beginning, and the way he has used the lighting and affects makes for an interesting study in the genre of fantasy."
1,does nobody see the emperor wears no clothes?,"Mulholland Drive is the most pretentious, discombobulated, self-indulgent drivel since the last bit of slow-moving, sepia-colored dreck Lynch foisted on a subservient and servile tribe of critics who have been too long in the land of too much sun (for the skin), too much dope (for the mind) and too much hot tub (for the proper and efficient functioning of the nervous system). Those who would sit still for the full length of this (film) manifest the surest signs of an eroded sense of time and tempo and a completely lost sense of dynamics, musical, emotional, and any other, including aesthetic and olfactory."
1,Worst movie ever,"Out of all the movies I have watched, (and I have watched a lot)Mulholland Drive is the most boring, pointless one I have seen. It is so boring, and has no story at all. I couldn't stand having to act in a movie as boring as this. The first hour in a half is just a bunch of people walking aroud. During that first hour in a half, they say about 15 words. Then, the last half hour is the most weirdest thing you've ever seen. And that weirdness has no point, or relation to the story whatsoever.I even whatched it again, too give it a sencond chance or see if I missed any important plot, but still, it was the same boring slow movie. There's no suspense, just people doing normal stuff. Please don't watch this movie, it will be a waste of 2 hours of your life, and you will be dissapointed, and bored. I have never seen anything so boring, not even a Ken Burns documentary. TERRIBLE!"
5,Good movie!,"Mulholland Drive is a great movie, but it may not be for everyone. It is a bit on surrealistic side in that there are mysteries that you as the viewer need to resolve. I'm the type of person who likes this sort of thing. I enjoyed the Lost TV series and the movie Inception. If you are a fan of those two, you'll probably enjoy Mulholland Drive. Another thing that may put some people off is that it is about lesbians. Lovely lesbians, nevertheless. Also, there is a little bit of nudity. The acting is superb, especially by Naomi Watts who tries to make sense of the mysteries surrounding her and her lover. At the same time she has her eyes set for a movie career. Also, there is a great scene where Dolores Del Rio sings Roy Orbison's classic Crying in Spanish. Beautiful version."
3,Bizarre...still considering this one.,Will definitely keep you wondering what the actors and David Lynch were thinking. What is the point of this movie? I'm not even sure what the plot of this movie is.
5,Nice!,"My father has been looking for this movie for quite sometime in stores. I was looking for a Christmas gift for him, and came across this on Amazon. The dvd showed up quickly and without any damages."
1,You will think it is good but as the kids say it 's bad,"What a waste of time. 80% of the movie can be followed, the last 20% is a mess. If you are into weird freak shows with no redemming qualties plus a total lack of realism, this is your movie."
1,"Terrible, disjointed film","David Lynch apparently doesn't care how relevant one scene is to the next, and he spins lots of random, insignificant scenes into what could be a decent story. Some individual scenes could be quite amazing, but they made no sense whatsoever, in a story that was supposed to make sense. David Lynch doesn't explain anything, and I am guessing people see the film as profound and deep since know one can muster any understanding of it whatsoever. (I have talked to three other people about Mulholland, and none had any idea what the plot was...)"
1,What the hec was that?,"Well, I just watched it. What it means is beyond me. Scenes lasted forever and went nowhere. Save yourself 2 1/2 hours and watch paint dry!"
3,A lot of great ideas that go nowhere,"I love the first hour and a half of this movie. David Lynch is true to his form, spinning a story that just draws you in from the very beginning. Which is why the anticlimactic ending is such a dissapointment. I remember seeing this movie in a theater, and when the closing credits rolled, half the audience said in unison ""that's it?"" I have to give it up to the actors though: they really got into their characters and acted quite convincingly. That goes especially for Naomi Watts (Betty/Diane) who manages to play two characters that are diametrically opposite of each other, both with the same gusto. If you are a David Lynch fan, this movie is as David Lynch as you can get. However, if you just like watching movies, Mulholland Drive may be a little (or a lot) frustrating to watch."
4,A mere technical comment,"I won't go into a review of the content of the film; perhaps another time for that.What I will comment on is the absence of chapters in the DVD! A 2 1/2 hour film and no chapters!Here's the kind of problems that creates.I bought a used copy and it was a bit smudged on the shiny side. About an hour and ten minutes into the film, the smudge part is hit and the skipping starts.OK, out comes the DVD, the surface is given a once over with a tissue and back into the player.Now what? Five minutes of fast forwarding is what.A while later, something comes up for me two hours into the film and I have to take it out.Returned later, popped the DVD into the player and now an even longer wait for fast forward to do its magic.Hey David Lynch! Whose dopey idea was it to exclude chapters? Yours, the production companies?Real bad idea."
3,My head hurts . . .,"Ever since Blue Velvet, not to mention Twin Peaks, David Lynch has been famous for the impenetrability of his films. I've seen them all, over the years, and this time Lynch out-Lynches himself. There are some great dreamlike scenes here -- especially the sequence in the Club Silencio -- and some great, eccentric characters, but as a total film, I never did figure out what in the hell was going on. Are Betty and Diane the same person? Or just the same actress? Or is Betty actually Diane's dream-version of herself? Ditto Rita and Camilla? Is Aunt Ruth actually alive or actually dead? Who is the guy who faints dead away in the alley? What's with the locked blue box? And the homeless guy? *sigh* Maybe I've just reached the limits of my patience with abstract film, but this one is too much for me. My wife doesn't like Lynch and wouldn't watch this with me, so maybe I just need someone to discuss it with. Or maybe Lynch has simply, finally, stepped off the edge."
2,to be honest....,"you don't see a reviewer actually admit to being too dumb to understand a movie, but that's what happend in my case with this movie...all i know is that there was a blue box, and all of a sudden no one had the right name anymore! it made sense for about an hour and a half... but then i lost track of what was going on. and i agree with the guy who said people re-watch this for the sex scenes. they were pretty spicy. but not spicy enough for me to bother with this confusing film again.it's along the lines of pi and donnie darko, but those movies actually made sense. i'd recomend those instead."
2,25 Words Or Less,"I learned from Twin Peaks that David Lynch is as much ""B.S."" as ""artist"". ""Usual Suspects""-style twist ending doesn't reward an unpleasant viewing experience.DVD NOTE: Lacks any worthwhile extras, and the entire movie reads as one chapter. If you accidentally chapter skip, be prepared to spend an awful long time searching to find your place again."
2,???,I didn't get it. Anyway what this movie trying to say ??I can't believe I sit and watch this movie about over two hours.What was the plot about ?
3,"No bonus features, and censored nudity","You can't forward to a scene which would be helpful for a movie like this. The insert has 10 ""clues"" to help fans figure out this movies complex layers but they create more questions than they answer.I can't stand that it is a beautiful widescreen print which they censor during the lesbian love scene. No commentary, no documentary, only a trailor and filmography for 4 people in the movie. Blue Velvet is being rereleased with some bonus stuff, perhaps they are planning to do the same for this DVD. Come on David Lynch, give us something besides a ""clue"" to look for coffee cups."
1,Review of 1 STAR for THIS SHABBY DISC - NOT THE MOVIE,"The movie is great and as everyone here agrees - great and David Lynch fun but this disc is a shabby version. On some laptops, the only portion that plays is a short macrovision movie - yea, thanks. I finally discovered that VLC will play this disc correctly so NOTE, it may or may not play on your DVD machine correctly even though it claims to be a DVD.Also note, Universal was too cheap to make chapter marks - there are movies on DVD from the 1920's with chapter marks - none here so if you miss the days of rewinding and fast forwarding like VHS - here ya go ... the resolution is also just a B - probably has something to do with the macrovision interfering with the picture quality.So, great movie but SKIP this disc - wait for a better version if you can."
4,What a tangled web we weave...,"I knew before I watched this film that you either hated it or loved it, thought it confusing or brilliant, therefore I went in watching this with an open mind and... I loved it!""A love story in the city of dreams"" so the tagline goes. Ha Ha. David Lynch does have a sense of humor.I was compelled with the story and Rita and Betty and the Director (Justin Theroux). I wanted to know how all three of these people fit together and then came the blue box and everything shifted. Wow! Then I realized how everything fit together. If you love movies with a little more intelligence in them, I highly recommend MULHOLLAND DRIVE.My one gripe was that I wished a little bit more of the Diane and Camilla story were fleshed out more because I felt that Camilla was a little too cruel to Diane. I wanted to understand why Diane would be involved with such a cold-hearted woman and why Diane would spend the first half of the film... well... I won't give anything away.This one is a keeper."
2,whaaaat?,"I heard from others that I would probably have to watch this film a few times to get it, but I honestly don't think I could go through watching it again. It's just too all over the place for me to keep track of it without going insane. I attempted to sit down and figure out where everything connected once the movie was done, but my mind felt like it had been spun in the washing machine at top speed. The only reason why I am not giving it one star is because I agree with everyones' opinion that it's an extremely intellectual movie, like Memento. Unfortunately, if I'm going to spent the money to see it in the movies or rent it, I want an explanation of what the hell went on."
1,Movie is Awesome DVD is terrible,Don't waste your money on this DVD. It has no interviews and what's realy bad is that there are no chapter or scene breaks. If you want to jump to a specific scene you can't. You have to fast forward. I can't believe they released it this way.
1,Mulholland Drive,"I really don't see what other people see in this movie, I think it is a waste of money and it is ""STINKO"" first class."
1,See what you think.,"I am a huge fan of imagery and surealism. However, this film wore down my patience. There is no way to ever completely understand a Lynch film. The enjoyment in his work comes from mood and intrigue. Mulholland drive did not have nearly enough intrigue to compensate for the lack of logic. Scenes were strung together in a frusterating order. I kept anticipating some funtctional link tying previous scenes together. But as the movie went on, all the audience is treated to is mindless vignettes that only confuse the plot until the only sensible explanation to what you are watching, is that Lynch wrote the script after waking up from a dream. A very tedious dream at that."
4,Still happy,"Once again, a pleasant buying experience buying from Amazon. Although the movie was a bit darker than I expected, it still is a noteworthy addition to my collection."
5,MOVIE OF THE YEAR!,"I'm not a great movie fan anymore. Most of Hollywood's productions don't impress me much these days, but this movie is just fantastic! Without giving too much away, the movie is about two lesbians with a love/hate relationship. I really can't say much more without ruining the story. One helful tip: you must read David Lynch's list of clues before watching the film. It will increase your enjoyment tremendously. This is a movie that you have to unlock. The storyline doesn't present itself in a straight forward manner. There are still some aspects of the movie that I don't understand, but the list of clues helped me to get most of it.It may be a good idea to watch the film more than once to get it. Its unique, I doubt there is anything like it in the world, even among Lynch's other works. Approach it knowing its not going to be what you expect. It [plays]with your mind a little, but that's what makes it so [very] great!"
2,What???,"Well that David Lynch has gone and ticked the whole world off once again!! I swear this man just makes movies to drive his viewers crazy. Don't get me wrong. I swear he his the only director who can film 146 min and leave every single door WIDE open. Take off your thinking goggles,people because you just ain't gonna get it. Sure, watch it 4,5,8 times. It's not gonna work.I was intrigued yet very disappointed of the how the movie went on. I mean it's one thing to watch crappy ending but at least you understand how the movie got to ending. Do you know what I mean? I'm not going to critique this movie. You can read other viewer comments. But as you read on, you will begin to notice that no one can really explain the storyline to you. It's a movie you have to experience on your own. But as I said before, David Lynch is sitting in his $500,000 rocking chair laughing at all us poor souls that are still shaking our heads,thinking""What the hell just happened?"""
2,Great movie. BAD DVD RECORDING.,"The movie is one of the best in 2002 according to the Times Magazine, but the movie was recorded badly because my Toshiba SD-3006 DVD player could not play the entire movie. It stalled in the switch layer change. The recording studio should do a better job for recording two-layer disc movies. Every other DVD movies play fine in my DVD player.Also, this movie does not offer chapter skip. You must fast-forward or rewind where you left off. Since my DVD player stalled while watching Muholland Drive at 1:08:00, I tried to get it played again but there was no solution for me to recover. Therefore, I am unable to watch the entire movie. Not sure if new DVD players do that also.Walter Chan"
1,Beware the DVD version...,"Whether you like the film or not, the DVD is garbage for one simple reason. There are NO chapters or scene selection capabilities! Is this Lynch's ego trying to out-weird himself? I have never bought a DVD without this feature and usually it's a huge reason to opt for the DVD. If you have to stop the feature for some reason, you either have to pause it forever or stop it and then have to start all over. It's idiotic and unbelievably inconsiderate of his fans, like he's thumbing his nose at them after he's got their money. Sorry, but that just makes him a jerk in my book. If you want the film, save some money and do yourself a huge favor. Get the VHS version."
5,more realistic than it seems,"People seem to either LOVE this movie or hate it with a passion. Those who don't like it seem to think that there are countless holes in the plot that are left unfilled. This simply is not true. Every humans views of things are slightly different other humans views. Views become even more twisted over time. Chances are that most of your memories are slightly askew from what the reality was at the time. Betty/Diane came Hollywood expecting it to be everything in her dreams. When she realizes the reality of things she gets torn apart mentally. Thats why she kills her lesbian lover at beginng of the movie(the end chronologically) and it is why here memories of what happened are get so twisted until she shoots herself in the head to kill the demons inside. I can understand someone not liking this movie because of its disturbing nature, but everyone should atleast acknowledge and give credit to director David Lynch because he is certainly smarter than the average movie maker."
4,A David Lynch mind game,"Mulholland Dr. is one film you must see if you're a fan of the works of David Lynch. Through the first 3/4 of the film, you think you're watching a regular movie with a few odd scenes. Then, in the last quarter, you actually reallly have to use your brain to get into the film. If you're watching on auto-pilot, you'll just scratch your head and go ""Huh?"" by the time the credits roll.Interestingly, this DVD has no chapter stops. I suppose it's to make sure you watch the movie in one sitting. This works to a disadvantage, since this is one film where you'd want to go back to particular scenes to look for clues as to what's happening.I think the DVD packaging, which features two different cover designs featuring star Naomi Watts, can actually be taken as a clue as well.Very intense. Very mind boggling. Very David Lynch."
5,Misunderstood,"Why is everyone trying to understand this movie? Think of it as eye candy or a dream, and like all dreams, they rarely make sense. Lynch took creative chances by casting lesser known actors for this project. Given how beautifully they pulled this off, I'm surprised I haven't seen them in other films. Of course, seeing Rebekah del Rio in the theater scene singing the Spanish version of ""Crying"" -- makes it worth every penny!"
2,...,"I don't see why this film has been getting the praise it has. I heard all the hype and said, boy I think I should rent that one. Unfortunately it made absolutely no sense. The film ended and me and a friend looked at each other in disgust. Nothing really happens. I couldn't make out a plot, and I was really hoping they would clear things up in the end, making it a good movie, but no, the ending makes you want to hang yourself with a belt or something. I should have known when I heard that David Lynch directed it. Has anyone seen Dune? I read the whole series and then saw the movie and haven't seen a worse film adaption of a book since Breakfast of Champions with Bruce Willis. All in all, this movie kind of [was bad]. But if you just want to see two chicks get naked and make out, and you don't really mind the total absense of a story or a plot or cohesiveness or relavence of any kind, then by all means..."
1,A triumph for Lynch...An annoyance for the rest of us...,"This movie does exactly what I believe Lynch wanted to do...make an unsolvable puzzle. The movie is filled with too many loose ends for any reasonable interpretation to be the true. Much like some contemporary artists, Lynch is seeking to elicit responses from his audience, rather than convey a message. While such an objective is fine, unfortunately our scholars cannot allow for such a goal. Since they believe everything has a meaning, they will endeavor to find it. Then, they explain the ""great answer"" that they have found to all of us.My personal reaction to the movie is negative. The movie did not seem well-made technically. Most importantly, the movie failed to draw me and didn't elicit much of a response from me."
1,depressing,"I didn't understand it after the first watch but after reading more about it, the movie does make sense. Sure its an interesting exercise in film making. Sure its got some very moving points in it. The problem is the dreamside has people that are actually likable where as reality has none. ..."
1,A Movie Everyone Loves,"i don't know WHY everyone loves this movie. horrible. no plot, all lesbians. horrible. the only thing i liked was the director's reference to the 50s (cuz he loves 'em) and that song she sang and a couple of shots were really great. oh yeah, and when the lady said ""something bit me hard!"" but the rest [WAS BAD]. i was left feeling disturbed and confused. hated it. do not reccommend it. it's a movie that everyone says they like because they don't know what the hell is going on and don't want to admit it."
2,Come on people...,"I'm truly convinced that people that give this train wreck 5 stars want to be thought of as artsy, hip, and cool. A movie shouldn't have to be be watched 20 times or researched on the internet to figure out what the hell it was all about.The people probably can't wait for Vincent Gallo's ""The Brown Bunny"" to come out so they can 'love' that too."
1,A muddled mess ...,"I know a few people who liked Mulholland Drive, and one who loved it. Pretty much universally, when they praise the film they say something like, ""Don't expect a story or a plot ... just enjoy the images and symbolism."" Then the guys add, ""Oh, and the lesbian scenes."" Then the kicker: ""Most people just won't get it."" This, of course, in a vaguely disappointed, vaguely pitying tone.There are plenty of movies out there with imagery and symbolism ... AND a story. I'm actually a damned bright fellow, and if there were anything in Mulholland Drive to ""get,"" I'm very capable of getting.But there's not. Mulholland Drive is a slapped together piece of surrealistic [scenes], disguised as a ""visual poem."" It's about on par with the work of an average second-year film student.But it DOES have lesbian scenes!"
1,Who can esplain it?,"I have yet to find anyone who understood this film. I certainly didn't.David Lynch offers great music background, but too far out for me."
3,Would have gotten five stars if its ending made sense,"I consider myself to be a pretty smart individual, but, I must agree with Patrick, this movie made sense until almost to the end. Then, it went in another direction, I couldnt tell if the main character was having a dream or was it all real for her, well, I did enjoy the two women licking each other. After watching this movie it left me with that puzzled look. lol Even still, it was a good movie, if anyone likes movies like this, I would reccomend, ( running on Karma ) this is a great Cantonese movie about incarnation and the Karma it entails, a better movie by far,(easier to follow)."
1,muhollin junk,i watched this movie twice and still could not figure out the plot the way the kept switching from forard then backwards confusing to watch so i give it one star and thats being nice buyers dont waste yuor time
2,Not worth the work....,"I watched the DVD (from Netflix) last weekend. I figured out that the first 2 hours were a dream, but the last 25minutes failed to tie things up. If you have to go online for a full explanation of a movie, then why bother?? The only part I truly loved was 'Club Silencio'. It was awesome.To those who explained what was really goin on, THANKS. Because I don't have time to watch the movie 3 or 4 times to 'get it'."
3,I absolutely detested it. And absolutely loved it.,"I am a Lynch fan, and expected to enjoy this film. Which I did, I think. See, every twenty minutes of watching I would jump between two extremes - loving the movie, and then hating it. At times I told myself I have to buy this tomorrow (I rented it), and then I'd be wrenched with horrible disgust, I'd want to stop it and break the dvd into bits.As a movie, I don't want to own it. But, usually if a movie invokes a strong emotional response, it's great - right? I don't know - you just have to watch it. It was a good movie because it made me feel so much. It was like a roller coaster (for lack of a better comparison).It picks at your brain. If you want to experience this, watch this movie."
4,David Lynch not for everyone,"David Lynch at times can be a confusing film maker. He can also be a boring film maker. However, in this movie, which I felt to be more confusing then Memento, David Lynch gives a present to the audience. He creates a movie that will cause all those watching to spend the next few days obsessed with the film trying to determine what happened. I came into the movie, knowing that it was going to be confusing, most of the way through the movie, I felt that I had a handle on the film. But, Lynch throws a twist into the movie that causes intelligent movie-goers to scratch their head. With that said, the beginning is a little slow, and the movie does take a little effort to get into, but once you are engulfed, the movie cannot go long enough. A must see to those looking for a movie that requires thought."
1,Stop making sense.,"Very well acted and the first 2/3rds was worth watching. However the entire audience laughed on the way out of the theater over how totally incomprehensible the film was. Was it a dream, there is no way of knowing but who cares. We all have strange dreams sometimes; is that an excuse to make an incoherent movie?"
1,I'd rather jab stakes under my nails.,"than watch this movie a second time. This was by far the most wasted hour of my life! I do not recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys an actual plot!To bo honest, I can't possibly say enough horrible things about this movie!If you enjoy frustration and an acid trip without the help of drugs, this will do it for you.Don't waste your time!"
2,Are we talking about the same movie?,"I'm no stranger to slow pacing or difficult plots, but I have never sat through a movie so excruciatingly boring as this one. Even if there is a twisted and mirrored truth in this movie, it's certainly not worth the 2 and a half hours to figure it out. Save yourself the agony."
1,*yawn*,"Quite possibly one of the most boring films of great potential I've ever seen. I just wanted it to be over. This film could have been so good if they'd been a little less wanky, and a bit more in touch with the characters'. None of the shortfall was due to the cast mind you - stunning performances by them. It's the script that made me want to drive nails through my toenails. I hope this gets remade some time in the future with changes, because it was several yawns short of brilliant."
1,Too cheap to put on scene selection,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap, too CHEAP to put on scene seletion. Don't buy this if you need scene selection get a VHS or a CVD instead.As for the movie I started it twice but never finished it, I'm tossing it instead."
1,No chapter menu? -- PLEASE!,"As a movie, you will either love this or hate it based on how you feel about David Lynch. Personally, I'm a Lynch fan, so I found the movie to be funny, suspenseful, scary, sexy, and thought-provoking.Now, on to the DVD itself. No chapter menu?!? This is completely ridiculous! This type of movie lends itself to re-watching certain scenes to solve the mystery. Sorry, no can do! You'll have to watch the entire movie again or go through a tedious fast-forward search.I'll give the movie four stars, but this lousy DVD gets one!"
3,Weird!,"Left-brained, analytical people should not watch this movie. My head hurt after leaving the theatre trying to figure everything out. Made me laugh the more I thought about the movie afterward. I would like to know where she got her brand of lipstick that stayed on so perfectly (even in the shower) throughout the entire movie."
5,Another gem from the master of the cinematic subconscious,"""Mulholland Drive"", like most of Lynch's work, is not meant to be understood in a rational way. It is a movie of ethereal beauty, one of Lynch's best, in my opinion. This is true Lynchian magic, and if you want to know why he has such a devoted cult following, you should definitely see this movie.In this particular film I think Lynch is trying to provoke us, even enrage us, by openly ridiculing our basically relative and ultimately bogus ideas of 'identity' or 'reality'. The movie opens with a botched murder attempt, and from there spirals into a darkly erotic and dreamlike tale of madness, amnesia, mystery, and troubled beauty. The scene in the theater is maybe one of the most unforgettable and hypnotic scenes I've ever encountered in a movie, and surrealism addicts (like myself) will be engrossed by it from start to finish. A masterpiece."
4,Interesting....,First of all I'd like to thank the other reviewers for explaining this movie.It honestly didn't make a whole lot of sense the first time I watched it.I watched it again after reading some of the spoiler reviews and I liked it a lot better.Brilliant direction.Visuals are gorgeous.Excellent acting.A story that will make very little sense the first time you watch it.It's sort of explained at the end but only a little.It's not a film that will be appreciated by casual movie watchers.I recommend a rental for patient viewers.
4,"Bizarre movie, but a masterpiece","When I first heard about this movie, it didn't convince me to go see it. Then when all the buzz at the oscars started, it made me curious. This movie was very thought-provoking, it made you think beyond the box, it pushes you to differentiate reality from dreams. There's alot of surreal scenes, and scenes that don't make sense, but it makes you draw your own conclusions.There's no right or wrong conclusions. I like this movie because it's edgy, bizarre, unique, and surreal. David Lynch did an excellent job of bringing out the bizarre imagination in all of us."
1,Horrible Movie,"I have never heard of this movie when I picked it up at the video store and I'm sorry I ever picked it up. To be honest, it started out pretty good. Then about half way through, BAM! The whole story goes from a smooth ride to straight in the middle of nowhere.When it was over I asked my self,""What the * did I watch""? I still don't understand it. Stay away from this movie. And if you feel you MUST see it, stop it half way through and use your imagination to think of a better ending."
3,Lost on Mulholland Drive,"Wow.Um...OK...this movie was...umm...wait, let me start over.This movie was...the most...the most...INTERESTING?...movie I have seen so far? Yeah. That's the word. Interesting.I'm still confused. But I liked it. Naomi Watts was excellent! and it was a treat to see Ann Miller!The imagery was stunning to say the least, but I won't be going behind any diners for a long,long time. Watch this film. You won't ever forget it."
3,I am torn.....,"I love Naomi Watts sooooo much that it hurts for me to say anything negative about a movie she is in. But.... here goes.. I wanted sooo to like this movie. In fact, I did like the first half of the movie. It had good suspense, exceptional acting and it kept you glued to the screen.... Then.... it happened....The second part of the movie.... What the hell happened???? I have no idea.. I actually should have known with it being a David Lynch movie and all. I should have known that he would pull this on me, like he does every time in his movies. I guess if you took the two seperate movies within the one movie you would have 2 very good ones. But combined into one, you have one very confusing thing going on. It is worth the watch just to see Naomi doing her thing. Just don't expect too much from it, it will only disappoint you."
1,is everyone insane?,"the only reason to watch this movie is the lesbo action with Laura Harring, she is by far the most beautiful woman I've ever seen and carried the movie for me. Oh, everyone else is pretty good, and the shots are eerie and cool, but the movie itself is just HORRIBLE!! The whole thing is apparently a fantasy of this girl who may or may not have actually had someone killed and gone insane. By the end, you won't know what the hell happened (no one else will either) and you'll feel something greasy on your sphincter. Not only is it boring, but David Lynch's attention to little details throughout is irritating (to say the least). Imagine wasting your valuable ""entertainment time"" watching a blank television and there ya go..Mulholland Dr."
1,Fragments of Cack,"I once read that David Bowie used to construct his song lyrics by wrting random phrases and words on strips of paper and then plucking them out of a proverbial hat and assembling them as they came.Lynch apparently employs a similar approach with his film making, as this admittedly visually appealing mish-mash of symbolism just skitters from one scene to something completely unrelated until the credits roll.The acting is ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL. I have to stress this, as everyone else here comments on Oscar nomination performances, but trust me, the level of acting is comparable to Yankee soap operas (perhaps purposely?) and everyone just ambles about spouting vacuous lines at one another.I've seen some tripe in my time and this is up there with J-Lo's Angel Eyes."
4,Worth every jcpenney,"I personally enjoyed the movie. Rent it and decide for yourself. I will watch it again with a different mindset this time.Hearing the spanish version of ""Crying"" was worth it to me."
1,"Exploitative, Manipulative, Unworthy","I agree, you don't always have to ""get"" a movie, but there should be something intriguing and well done about it. MD has nothing but exploitative lesbian love scenes (obviously for the sake of male viewers), a director able to manipulate the audience into thinking there's some significance behind his audio-visual ramblings, and a movie unworthy of anyone's time, money, or thoughts.I even enjoyed Lost Highway, Blue Velvet, and some other Lynch tales. But he lost out on this one. We laughed through most of it, and then fastforwarded when we couldn't even find this trash funny anymore."
1,This was the worst,"BORING!!!! I gave it one star because there are no negative stars. I really like David Lynch, but this totally lost me. It was boring - I kept waiting for something to happen. I can take it if all the loose ends are not neatly tied up - but when NONE of the loose ends are explained it is just too much. There were too many odd characters just apparently for the sake of having odd characters - they didn't mean anything, add anything, and were never explained. This is certainly NOT Lynch at his best - I loved Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet, especially Wild At Heart, etc. etc. This however, was a huge waste of life.I am thankful that I only rented the DVD and did not pay to see this in the theater."
1,not worth the time,"I ADORE thought provoking hard-edged films(ex. requim for a dream , memento , etc). Anything that will get my curisody to run wild. Laura did quite a good job performance wise.However this film did NOT impress me at all, it was hyped up to be something it wasnt.This simply was not a good movie.My recommendation rent Memento or Donnie Darko instead."
1,Terrible movie and terribly annoying!!!,"I am glad I did not buy this movie! I started watching it with some interest and figured that the array of characters would link together in the end. I was sadly disapointed by this flick.When the characters made a switch after they open the mystery box with the blue key, I wanted to skip back a chapter to catch it again-but wait...the DVD didn't have any scene options so I turned off the movie. I came back to it grudgingly and had to FFWD through the movie.At the end of the movie, I sat wondering what the guy at the diner who had a paranoid fear of some homeless guy living in the alley had anything to do with the story's main plot. What was that???I get that there was a shift from reality to fantasy but I suppose that David Lynch expects most movie viewers to tie up the loose ends in this movie but I was left with too many loose ends to make any sense of it all.Too annoyed to watch it a 2nd time!"
1,total garbage,"David Lynch, give me back the two and a half hours of my life I lost forever by watching this garbage!! Not to mention my...rental fee.Only recommended for those who enjoy overblown pretentious pseudo-intellectual ""films"" that actually make absolutely no sense and are about as fulfilling and entertaining as watching paint dry."
2,"Another Lynch, ""what does it mean?"" films.",I loved the actors in this film-I thought they were awesome. Does anything tie together? Hell no. None of the sequences blend together-and I don't want to have to spend time trying to figure it out. You don't have to have some psychic powers to understand the film. The fact is-it is just thrown together all weird and confusing. I thought there would be some amazing ending. I actually enjoyed sitting and watching it-up until the last quarter of the film when my mind was unable to decipher who was what or who.I don't know-rent it if you like David Lynch I guess-just be prepared for a big question mark.
2,"if there are no other movies left on earth, skip this one.","a lot of people will write rave reviews about how brilliant and psychologically chilling this movie is. how lynch has done it again. david lynch may very well be a genius, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you in all of your everyman glory will understand any of it. there are some very winning performances in the movie (most notably naomi watts and laura harring), and although the acting was good, even the actors couldn't act like they knew what the hell was going on. very lynchian. but as long as david lynch is still alive, there will be at least one person in this world who knows what this film was about...even if he's not telling."
2,"Let's not lynch Lynch, but.......","I was tempted to give only one star to this film, but thepurely visual beauty of the film is impressive and the""lesbian"" scenes are both tasteful and erotic. However,that is sllim fare for this disappointing film. Lynch breaksno new ground, anyone having scene Blue Velvet orTwin Peaks will spot the lynchisms. The narrative isnon existent and who really cares how many hiddenclues (if any) are to be found upon subsequent viewings.(this is no Usual Suspects).The film collapes upon itself, perhaps by design, butleading to my own attention span collapse. And whyis Robert Forster given star billing when we see himso little? Oh well....in short, this is a perhaps typical""aren't I cute"" Lynch effort. and yes even the mostliterate film viewer might be wasting his/her time here."
1,Lynch fans only - I Lost 2hr22 minutes of my time,This film is just plain disappointing. I believe Lynch try tocreate some kind of Art Nouveau cinema but he just does nothave the genius to back it. The film has no conclusionwhatsoever and left me with the feeling of having lost 2h30 hrsFor Lynch fans only.
4,Who cares about the plot.,Too complicated. Watched the movie twice. Still have no clue what the plot is about but who cares since the ladies are sooo hot !!!
2,Mulholand Drive ???????????????????,"The most confusing movie I have seen in my life. I did not get the point of this movie at all. When you rate a movie on here you must give a star amount, I only gave it a 2 because I did not understand it at all. If you like strange movies watch this."
1,"Hello, Chapter Selection?","Loved the movie, but the features (or lack thereof) are the worst that I've seen for any DVD to date. Rent the VHS copy so that you have the ability to skip around, and save the remaining [amount] for something more practical--like an updated (Criterion Collection) release of this DVD."
4,Admirable... but too long for a mind-bender!,"First of all, I admire this movie for having a subtle yet intelligently and creatively done plot. This is a one-of-a-kind movie to see and I would like to recommend this to people who gains pleasure in viewing such weird movies. Don't wonder if after viewing the film for the first time, you'll be in awe and say, ""What's this movie I've just seen?"" I think that's what everyone have in mind after viewing the movie for the first time.Thanks to one reviewer below I was able to fully comprehend what David Lynch was trying to detail in this movie. Just then I realized how fantastic and delusional must be having a mind like David Lynch. I've seen the movie twice now and my second reaction is that viewers may get tired looking for clues for 2 1/2 hours. The only lapse in this movie is that it is too long and sometimes too tiring. If only some scenes were deleted or shortened, this piece could be a masterpiece to play with."
3,"Weird, weird movie!!!","It was hard for me to get into this film, and understand it!! Most of the movie revolves around two women trying to find out where one came from and the owner of a lot of money. They end up falling for each other, and the movie only gets weirder from there. I would deffinately say watch it, if you are in the mood for a different type of movie!"
2,Good Movie; Awful DVD,"I love David Lynch's movies and Mulholand Drive is no exception but when I popped this DVD in my player I noticed something missing: NO CHAPTER SELECT OPTIONS! I never realized how important of a feature that was until this movie. Having already seen Mulholand Drive in the theater, I really wanted to skip around to see some of more...um...Lynchian scenes, but the only way to do it was to FF...annoying! I know that sounds trivial but really, how hard could it have been to include a ""feature"" that is standard in every other DVD out there?!? Craziness. The 2 stars is for the DVD itself, not the movie."
5,Buzzing,"The feeling I felt after walking out of the cinema was something I had never experienced before.I knew little of the film before seeing it and had never seen any of David Lynch's work.Having no preconceptions and an open mind allowed for a cinematic experience that left me buzzing with excitement,confusion and amazement for hours after the final credits rolled.I was so impressed that I returned to the cinema the following afternoon for a repeat viewing and discovered even more about the film.It gets better with every viewing and is therefore an essential purchase."
3,"Fast-paced, erotic, and streamlined; keep's you guessing!","The two main female characters strike quite a pair in this moive. Continually. Aphroditic and erotic, this movie is literally a blast from the past! ."
3,Naomi Watts is Fantastic,"This movie is full of David Lynchisms..dwarfs, dream sequences, kinky sex. For those not into Lynchisms, it is worth it just for the performance of Naomi Watts... Without revealing the plot, she has a number of personality changes. She is convincing and powerful in every mode. Very sexy too."
1,WTF???,PUKE!!! UGH!!! WRETCH!!! VOMIT!!! Worst movie ever! A bunch of deep nonsense. Utterly unwatchable.
1,Terrible. Simply terrible.,Here's my only point of a review on this movie: Can anyone honestly tell me what this film was about?That's all.
1,Unbelievably boring and slow,"It is seldom that I don't finish watching a movie even if I'm not enjoying it. I try to stay with it until the end,and a number of times I have been happy that I did. Mulholland Drive was so slow and boring that it was impossible to stay with it. This movie was everything that is wrong with film making; an incomprehensible plot, characters that you don't care about, actors walking through the role making it painfully clear they're just in the movie for a paycheck.The best words I can use to describe this movie are pretentious babble. Don't waste your time. If you want a solid, well-acted, intelligent film noir, purchase ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" instead."
1,So sad,"I was very excited to finally watch this movie after hearing all the hype, I love these kind of movies. But sadly after watching it twice, I have to say this [was disappointing] ! The first round I didn't quite get the whole story so I actually sat through the whole thing again a second time. Well, I think I got the story all right. Some areas were put together cleverly, the acting wasn't too bad, but the story itself is just terrible. Nothing exciting or original !! For those who compares this with Pulp Fiction or Memento, please don't ! Its nothing like them. The otheres were clever, this is plan stupid."
5,David Lynch's Best Film,"I feel Mulholland Drive is David Lynch's best film. I've seen Blue Velvet and although it is a very good film, this film feels superior. I was more intrigued by this film and Lynch's over indulgence was kept to a minimum in this one. There were less moments there for the sake of being there, even though the end with the old people was vintage Lynch, all the way.This is a hard film to categorize, it's a psychological thriller, at the same time an erotic thriller, and a pyschological drama. It's a bunch of things, as Lynch does well. Plus, there's more than enough Lynch moments to satisfy the fan and enough non Lynch moments to satisfy the non fan. It will take you for a ride and never let go.The only extra is the theatrical trailer, there's not even a chapter search, really makes you watch the film. But I'd rather have a chapter feature to go back and find my favorite moments.Must See."
4,beyond reality,"a lovely and surreal film that explores the areas in between and various incarnations of the void. The deliberate and methodical style of taking the viewer into unknown, but strangely familiar surroundings proves eerie and soothing. One truly loses the self and becomes enveloped by this intense vision.For those who value escapism in all its glories and find visual images so sumptuous you can almost taste them..."
1,The arroganc of hollywood directors,"Why do I get the feeling from Mulholland Drive that I am supposed to like it simply because David Lynch directed it. I have never before seen a film where a director played on his name as much as Mr. Lynch did in this particular movie. To be perfectly honest, I did see the film because I have always enjoyed Mr. Lynch's films in the past but expecting anyone to sit through or enjoy such a piece of unbearable tripe is pushing things a little too far. MD was not only disjointed and poorly acted, it was probably the most boring film I have ever FORCED myself to sit through. The only redeeming feature in the whole show was the disparate group of characters s l o w l y trudging their way through a badly put together piece of David Lynch's folly."
1,A lot of ado about nothing - strictly nothing,"This movie is about......well, it's not about anything. There are a lot of characters, including an amnesiac woman befriending an aspiring actress, and a movie producer that has his hand forced by weird mafiosi to cast a certain woman in his movie, but there is no coherent thread or story, not even the patina of naturalism. This is the most disjointed and pointless movie I've ever seen. It's as if a pitcher with muscular dystrophy threw symbols around until there were enough of them to make a two-hour movie....The first third was somewhat interesting, but the rest is such a meaningless jumble of symbols that it makes you hate film just on principle."
2,Just Average,"This is not a masterpiece, nor is it in any sense horrible.THis movie was a pretty good movie, if you know what to ignore. There are plenty of scenes in this movie that you could take completely out, and it would have no effect at all. Why? Because many of the scenes are thrown in there, for apparently no reason.Yes, I got the point of the movie. But some of the dots do not connect, and a lot of people try to act smart by saying they love this movie. By saying you love a movie with some parts that made no sense, some people might be ""What a smart person, they got it and I didn't."" Well, that's pretty much what it comes down to with Lynch and his fans. I know a lot of what it is symbolism and illusion. But it's just not needed.Some of the stuff that gets thrown into this movie would be like randomly throwing some paint on a finished, very well made portrait. It only hurts it and it would have been better if left out. Which is why this movie only gets 2 stars."
1,thank god i didn't pay for my ticket,"i'm a big movie fan, and i like almost anything. but this was the worst movie i've ever seen. i've never heard a whole movie theater laughing in unison at how bad a movie was before. we got a free sneak preveiw and all left saying ""thank god i didn't pay to see this."" the movie is beyond strange, and beyong borning. for those who saw it their are 2 maybe three scenes i enjoyed and u know which ones those were."
3,I'm not sure we can call this a movie?!,"Mr. Lynch is certainly a talented director, and this film will backup his skills. Yet this film is really just a demonstration of Lynch's directing skills and not really a decent film in its own right...If the script was better than this film would have been an all star, but the story just leaves too many holes. Think about it, if the film was directed in a more conventional way, it wouldn't really get any praises. This is just too artsy, I mean it looks good, but I just don't see any substance backing all the eye candy."
2,highly overrated,"The only virtue that I can say that this movie has is that, unlike most movies, it leaves you wondering what the story is. Therefore, it not just another movie in that respect. In other words, if you think a plot that doesn't make sense makes a good movie, then this movie is for you. I wouldn't rewatch it to understand the story better."
