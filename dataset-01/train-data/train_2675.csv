3,flavor ok-no power,"These taste good-sometimes a little grainy when you get to the Hoodia part. I use these when I am in the mood for something sweet and I am trying to be good. At first, I had one or two a day thinking the the Hoodia would keep me from being hungry, but it had no effect on me. I would order these again though, because they do taste good and I feel like when I have one it is healthier than getting a candy bar. I had no side effects with these. I don't know what the power part was for-mabe just for the name."
1,BUYERS BEWARE!!!!!!,"I bought this product in great anticipation of eating a nice snack that will assist with my appetite and cravings. However, what I got was a pack of 7 NOT 30 lollipops! I have contacted the seller directly as well as via Amazon. There has not been a response to my emails and I have yet to receive the remaining 23 that I am entitled. So I have to say BEWARE!"
2,Not Worth the Money,"Most flavors tasted good, but I didn't see any major changes in appetite. For me not worth the money."
3,"Great for appetite control, but have not lost any weight yet.","I have had these for three weeks. They seem to really curb my hunger and they last a really long time, but so far I have not noticed much of a weight loss. I like most of the flavors but a few of them were awful. I did order two more bags to give them a chance, but this time I ordered from another source so I could pick out the flavors that I wanted...only saw the assortment at Amazon. I am buying them just for the fact that they last so long and they keep me from munching. I should eventually lose weight from that one benefit alone."
5,Some of the most beautiful cars you will ever encounter,"In this context, a woodie is a car partially constructed of wood. While such cars were never a dominant component of the American auto market, they are now a significant section of the auto collection and restoration genre. This book contains brief descriptions of some of the more interesting and beautiful examples of such cars.The photography is superb, and the quality of the subjects has a lot to do with it. These cars are beautiful, the combination of steel and precisely finished wood makes for some of the best looking cars you will ever seen. It is clear that restoring and refinishing these cars is a passion, and from the end product, one can see how that can be the case. If you have any interest in cars with wooden components, then this is a book that you must read."
3,"Bulky, long antenna, 1/2 unit bust on arrival","I've been hitting the slopes quite a bit this season. I've been using my friend's Motorola Talkabout radios (10 mile range, 99/100? privacy codes). I decided to buy myself a pair. This pair of Midlands happen to be on sale so I got them. Upon arrival, 1 radio gets loud yucky beeping noise when receiving transmission, regardless of the channel and subchannel. Will look into warranty info.Usability is just ok. This radio is bulky and its antenna sticks out too much. The unit is rather uncomfortable in my ski jacket.If you are thinking about buying a pair of radios, I'd stick with Motorolas... they are much better designed."
4,Over all good,It is good. Got this for the ear and mic combo. Has been fun to play with.Cons: Range is not the best. The batteries don't last that long.(can't give a time frame) but hey it is good.
2,Midland GXT410VP#,"I had previous experience with the older GXT310 walkie talkies and decided to upgrade to this more powerful set. I have been disappointed. I purchased 2 sets of (2)each and when received one did not work right out of the box. Another quite working within a two week period and even though they are rated at 12 mile range, they dont seem to reach out any further than the older units."
3,Not quite what I wanted,"I was hoping for a pair of radios that could be stored on the chargers until needed. Thus the radios would always have full batteries. Alas, this was not the case. The charger always charges and will destroy the batteries if left on there continually. So instead, I have to charge the batteries and then unhook the base from the wall to use the base to store the radios.They seem to work well otherwise. They are large due to essentially using AA batteries. I will update this in the future with any additional information."
1,[...],I UNDERSTAND THAT THE 12 MILE LISTED RANGE IS ONLY ON CLEAR LINE OF SIGHT... BUT I ONLY GET 1/3 OF A MILE RANGE IN MY HOME SUBURBAN AREA OF LOW HOUSES. ONE THIRD...[...]YOU SHOULD LOOK FOR ANOTHER PRODUCT.
3,good but in the city only have a 1km,me parece buen producto pero en la ciudad solo tiene alcance de mas o menos 1 o 2 km...
4,Very Cool!,"My DH loves the Oogie Boogie from ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" and I have not been able to find him anything to do with Oogie Boogie (aside from the $150 statue we saw in Walt Disney World, which he was not getting). When we got home I googled Oogie Boogie and this popped up. My DH was so happy when he opened it on Christmas. I definitely wouldn't get it as a toy, it really is like a display item. It's a great addition to my decor LOL, but my DH loves it so it stays. Definitely recommend for your Oogie Boogie inthusiast."
5,Great Book,This was a book my daughter in college is using and she is very satisfied with the purchase. She would recommend this to someone else.
5,Stunning,"Having read RW Cotton's other work first, I realized when I read While Angles Dance that this is all a part of an ongoing saga that gives a full account of how two troubled young men have allied their lives together in a desperate search for meaning during an insane period of bloodshed and violence. It is easy to laugh, cry, and at times almost bleed right along with his fictional outlaws. Miller Crowe & Quiet Jack are the most tortured, lonesome, complex and compelling characters to ever come out of a western novel. Angels Dance may well be the most spiritual in-depth western novel ever written"
5,While Angels Dance,Great read!! Ralph Cotton is a master at western fiction. His characters live in your memory long after the book is finished.They become old friends that you can't wait to see again.
5,Two thumbs up!,Best account of The James Gang ever written. Cotton makes you feel like you are riding along with these outlaws. At last somebody is writtiing westerns the way they should be written. Miller Crowe and Quiet Jack remind me of Butch & Sundance only more real
3,"A Good Medley of Dance Trance, but not Great","The selection was good and has representative tracks from various artists. I like the work of Paul Van Dyke and he is represented here. Harmonika by Estelle is my favorite. It is a light piece that builds up from a sequenced synthesizer guitar melody that is looped to become a rhythm. Most of the tracks are relatively mellow, but not as mellow as ""chill out"" would be. Although I liked individual tracks and all of them were at least okay, it did not work for me as a collection. The tone of the tracks is fairly compatible. The tracks flow together better than most I have heard, but it did not feel completely seamless. Some of the tracks still felt like they were still experimental and that possibly more fine tuned versions will appear later on. As experiments, though, they are still interesting."
5,Best TV I have seen yet.,Bought this TV a week ago and it is absolutely amazing. I have a HD DVD player and a blu ray player and have watched a number of different movies. The clarity and sharpness of the TV are amazing. I love this TV. One of the best purchases that I have made in a long time.
4,Looks Great So Far,"Not much to add to most of these reviews. The set was delivered promptly and very professionally by Eagle. The set itself looks fantastic on HD and even better than I expected on standard resolution. As other reviewers have noted, the factory default settings are terrible. I found the AVSForum website to be a very helpful starting place to learn about burn-in issues and suggested pictture settings. The Samsung's on-screen menu is very easy to navigate to make the initial set-up and changing settings a breeze.Overall, I am very happy with the purchase."
2,Service,"After reading the reviews on Amazon and seeing the Samsung model in stores,I decided to buy Samsung.Received my order from Amazon within 7 days.Delivery was great by Eagle.Set was fantastic for one week.Sound went out.It took three weeks to get fixed.One reason was the holidays and another reason that Samsung only had one company under contract in this area.That company never returned calls,and when I called them they said they were didn't know when they could come and that they were very busy.Samsung was pretty good and was concerned enough to call back.They had to get a company from Maryland under contract.They were prompt found the problem and ordered new sound board.Returned within week and fixed problem.All is well.I guess it could happen to anyone.Just trying to write honest review.Yes, I would buy another Samsung product and always from Amazon my favorite place to shop.Al"
2,TV has tuner issues...read on,"Both our Samsung's have tuner issues. When tuning into QAM channels they pick up different channels when changing channels up than when changing channels down. Talked to a Samsung engineer and they attribute it to ""tuner sensitivity"". Funny our cheaper HDTVs don't do this. Had tuners changed, problem still exists. Samsung just keeps cancelling our service orders. Last Samsung products I will ever purchase."
4,samsung tv,overall best tv we had (previous panasonic hd ready died after 3yrs.!?).Good picture out of the box! Actually trying to improve it following recos (from earlier reviews here) - made it much worse!went back to more or less original settings and it's fine.Imagine would be even better if we'd got HD box/chanells from cox .. (?)4 stars since hardly anything deserves 5 ;)a.h.
1,Never delivered,"Never received product after @ 2 weeks of waiting. Apparently Eagle Carrier lost it. However, the Eagle rep said it was Amazons fault. From reading reviews, it appears that this is not the first time Eagle has lost this product. If you order this tv, cross your fingers and hope you have better luck than I did. At this point I will pay more for the same product from a local store."
1,"Quit after 3 yrs, with no picture, and repairs beyond fixing.","Tv was used very little, picture went black, some sound, but repairs were more than a new tv......would never buy again."
1,Good tv right before it completely broke,"After reading all the reviews we bought this tv for $1000 in Aug07. Worked great (except for a few HDMI issues with Time Warner's DVR) - nice picture, okay sound, right up until one day, out of the blue the video just stopped. It's never had any damage - never even been moved. TV Repair said the main board was bad - common problem with these tvs. It was 2 years and 2 months from the date we bought it. Samsung was completely unreasonable - asked them just to cover the parts and we would pay the labor as this is a known problem - no luck.Good tv but very bad reliability. I wouldn't buy one unless you have a 5+ year warranty."
1,"looks cute, but beware","in 3 months, I rode everyday half an hour for work about 4 days a week. I am a 128 pound woman. And the result I got is that I had to replace the rear wheel twice in this short period. So for the second time the wheel bent with the spokes coming out, I decided not to spend another $80 (wheel and replacement fee at the bike store) for this bike, which doesn't have a warranty by the company. So it lasted only 3 months, and I spent much more than the bike is worth. Cute bike, but not worth it."
2,Warning,"Don't rely on the box requirements. I purchased this to play on my Windows XP computer but ""Secrets Can Kill"" and ""Stay Tuned For Danger"" cannot run on this system."
4,Hide & Seek,"I bought this as a birthday present for a friend's 2-year-old son who enjoys Sesame Street. He LOVES it. He uses it to play hide and seek with his parents. He learned that if he stood up in it, he could bring it around the house with him (the nomad!). His mom says it is a great place for him to play and he brings his animals and other friends inside the store. I'm thinking about ordering one for my little boy who will be 2 in January."
4,Hooper's Store is a great kid's gift,This play tent was a big hit with my grandchildren. And it's so portable it can go inside or outside on a moment's notice. I would recommend it for ages 2-6.
3,a comedy of cancer-fighting,"What is it all about? If not being a semi-biography of a later cancer-fighter, this work is just a comedy of a boyish bearded man on a motorbike hanging around Rome and Europe with no sexual commitment/interplay as nice music followed his any motion.Well, perhaps, it will worth more as a semi-doco over a few decades oncoming."
3,did you oil it?,i would realy like the answer for this question from both of the earlier writers. did you use food safe mineral oil on it every day for a week before useing the board for the first time? many companyes recomend this as the bamboo boards do NOT absorb moister like a regular wood board and as a result are suseptable to cracking from moister loss. so i ask DID YOU OIL IT?
1,Poor quality,I was given an Island Bamboo cutting board for a wedding present. It lasted less than a month before 4 separate splits appeared. The splits were both with and against the grain.Beautiful but not useful.
1,Only god Can Judge Me,Was more of a narrative than a movie or play like I thought. Would not recommend to anyone else to purchase.
5,I Love this album!,I heard this while living in England. Thank God for Amazon because it was rather difficult to find it when I got back to Minnesota! I love the variety and Cerys' voice. One of the best albums I've heard in a LONG time.
3,Catatonia is a wonderfully delicious group.,"International Velvet, is breathtaking. It is a great buy for those of us who have ""Love."" She sings about her life and interests in way that is very pleasing to all ears. I usually listen to Marilyn Manson or Crystal Method. I love Catatonia and I know you would too. They aren't anything brand new. They are just good and full of talent. Give'em a try!"
3,"Not as good as ""Way Beyond Blue""","Catatonia's latest CD is a disappointment, but even so it's a pretty good CD. The reason it's a disappointment is that it's uneven compared to the first. A few songs are wonderful; others are forgettable. I think this CD is still worth getting, overall. In particular, ""Mulder and Scully"" and ""Road Rage"" are fine songs. The trend is toward an edgier sound than their last recording. It is definitely recognizable as Catatonia and, as such, it is quite difficult to classify. Cerys Matthews' distinctive, resonant voice (and wonderful Welsh accent) make Catatonia unlike any other band on the planet."
3,So Much Hype For A Mediocre Band,"Forgive me, kids, because you must be kids who are so taken with a band that is nowhere near star level. At least not on this recording, the only one I've listened to. Granted, Cerys packs a wallop, displaying a voice that is custom made for Broadway Theatre or Cabaret. She's the real thing, with so much potential, but, the songs and arrangements leave a lot to be desired. This type of pop sound is so limiting to a talent as big as hers. The band sounds like dozens of others. The songs are absolutely unremarkable with lyrics that don't really mean too much. Johnny Come Lately, may be the exception, but, tell me this song is not reminiscent of the Cocteau Twins. Maybe she's just young and needs to mature a lot more, or, maybe they are just out to make a quick buck like most other rock acts. But this side of the Atlantic (US) doesn't need anymore of this type of Pop music. Come on, Cerys, you've got to take a giant leap into some new territory! You can do it."
5,Brilliant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"It took me ages to get hold of this in England, but the album is absolutely brilliant! (Have I already said that? Fave song?- Game On (Track 2), but the title track's pretty cool as well (even if the record company is incapable at arranging the lyrics!). As I am studying in Wales at the moment, it is great to listen to native talent, even if it does annoy everyone in halls when my stereo's on full blast! When it is finally available outside the UK, this is one album that should be on your shopping list - even if the only song you've heard on it so far is Mulder and Scully."
1,Sound of Muzak,"Gwen Stefani, now that she has struck out on her own from No Doubt, decides to go on her one-woman crusade to revive showtunes. Remember ""Fiddler on the Roof"" references in ""If I were a rich girl""? Well,this time Gwen steals a tune from ""Sound of Music"",brings in gratuitous yodeling, and concocts one of the most annoying pop songs ever.""Wind it up"" is perfect for driving away unwanted solicitors, annoying relatives, and disciplining unruly children. Pair it with ""Rough Guide to Yodel"" and you have a recipe for awfulness!"
3,Disappointing,"The book is not a cook book you can expect to manage succeeding in following through recepies and getting the same result as ment by the autor.Tones of products, some hard to find, tones of steps to each recepie..Better to eat at nobu than try and cook from the book..."
4,Very interesting summary of the physiology of running,"This book really ought to be called ""The Distance Runner"" because its focus is entirely on that topic; sprinting is only discussed when it provides an illuminating contrast to the distance sport. Also, there are an annoying amount of typos and grammatical errors in the book. They don't interfere with information transfer, but they brought me up mentally every time I crossed one and they come across as unprofessional. Those nits aside, this is an excellent discussion of past and current research on the effects of running on the human body and methods to maximize training and race performance. Costill and Trappe discuss the physiology of elite runners vs. the untrained, safe and effective training methods, differences between male and female runners, and the effects on aging on performance. An educational resource for runners at all levels."
2,Item very nice but shippiung with huge surprise !!!,"I was quite happy receiving the item ordered.But I was quite surprised, when I had to pay 17 Euros (about US$ 22), nothing was plan in the order !!!So next time I'll take care may be try to buy out of USA .............Fortunatly, Amazone had good iddea to send back about 6 Euros, it's better than nothing"
3,Catalog master,This is the master for those interested in colling world banknotes.I do think it's time to start replacing black/white illustration with color versions.
2,Another poor attempt,"Well yet another year passes and Krause gives us another inferior catalog. Inaccurate prices, incorrect pictures, notes two and three years old still not in the catlog. Since this is the only real catalog we can use for our hobby it has to do but i think that as hobbyists we need to let Krause know they need to take this book more serious and put a little more time, effort and professionalism into it. I know in years past I as well as many other hobbyists have sent Krause email after email with new pictures, errors in the catalog only to see the next catalog with out the changes. So it seems to me they do not take the us or our hobby very serious. It would be very nice to see another publisher get into the race and perhaps come out with the type of catalog we hobbyists deserve."
2,Arghans,"I was very disappointed by the latest issue of the 'modern issues' catalogue. There are at least two instances of incorrect page-headings, which are confusing, and one group of notes missed out completely - which suggests carelessness in editing the book. However my main disappointment is the number of issues which were new in 2005 or the first half of 2006 which have not been included - which, for a book dated and published in 2007 just is not good enough. If Krause Publications are going to make an annual out of the modern issues catalogue, then they must make the cut-off date for the inclusion of new issues much closer to the publication date. Why could they not put in the front a prominent note saying something like 'including all new issues up to July 2006'?I feel a bit cheated by Krause.Keith Potter"
1,Poor editing,The catalog is edited by George Cuhaj for the last several years. It is full of misleading unreal pricings. The editor has not corrected them since many years although he has been notified many many times by market experts. The catalog is losing its credibility as a refence book due to his very poor editing.
3,No attention to details,Many times in this bood you would look for notes that should have been listed and were not. I foound several right off the bat. I couse I would like to see something everyone dreams of - color photo's.
5,"Any library specializing in collectibles in general or collectible money issues, needs this","The 16th edition of Standard Catalog of World Paper Money provides small black and white images and an authoritative text packed with details on world paper money from 1961-Present. Any paper money collector will easily consider this a 'bible' reference, offering grading standards insights, written descriptions of the issues, and more! Any library specializing in collectibles in general or collectible money issues, needs this!"
3,No Colour (NOT ATTRACTIVE) BUT very complete guide,"the paper money that shown in this book, doesn't have colourand very dull to look at it... BUT it cover a very very complete guide for reader, user, or collector...Not so much recommended,only if there is improving (colour)...then i 100% recommended..."
5,Installation is easier than you might think,"Lee Oskar, one of the better harmonica brands, was the first harp to have replaceable reed plates. Many of the quality harps have almost doubled in price in the last decade so replacing the reed plates when a reed goes out makes sense.The Lee Oskar replacement reed plates come with detailed instructions and if you have the proper screwdriver (a #1 Phillips) the reed plates can be changed pretty quickly. So instead of buying a whole new harmonica when a reed goes bad, you can buy new reed plates and have a harp as good as new for about half the price."
1,don't try it if you don't know what your doing,well got this and tried to change the plates but no new screws in the box. tried to use old screws and didn't work. crap
1,Couldn't make it work,"The self-tapping bolts require a ridiculous amount of pressure to cut through the bottom reed plates. I ended up with sore hands, stripped bolt heads and a harmonica that won't play."
4,I like it!,"I really like this watch. It is attractive and can be worn with just about any outfit, casual or dressy. I was distressed at first when our local jeweler was unable to adjust the band. He said the pins were way to tight and tiny. I was afraid that I would have to send it back to Amazon. So I took it to a watchmaker who was able to accopmplish the task for $20. The only other problem I have with the watch is the clasp is a real nail breaker."
4,SHOWTIME From MGM.,"Chasing Rainbows is a wonderful story of a musical company on tour.Produced by MGM it is unfortunate that the Technicolour musical inserts no longer exist.The restorers have however inserted sub titles to keep us informed of the story.A fantastic cast have been assembled with comedy from Marie Dressler and Poly Moran together with a dry droll Jack Benny. The pace is quick with leads Bessie Love and Charles King taking the leads.The musical specials are wonderful, with catchy tunes and chirpy dance steps from the ensemble.A great and very enjoyable backtage picture from the MGM vaults- Wonderful."
4,grateful,I have several of this book and they help me to create my treatment and objectives for my clients. This new one is direct to the population that I am working now. It was very helpful
5,Just a piece of steel,Good for making structures capable of supporting a few hundred pounds - don't confuse with lighter gauge versions.
2,Seems Radical,"To be perfectly honest i felt like this book asserted some pretty over-generalized claims and failed to use any specific hard evidence to back them up. With a lack of support for such ideas, it was hard to find much of the text believable. I stopped reading pretty early into it because it was just hard to see how this book was even 50% valid. Currently I am researching a thesis on COINTELPRO and its disruption tactics. I understand that much of the FBI's actions can be so invading its hard not to be disillusioned, however I don't believe that justifies pointing every finger we can find at the government without looking at direct facts."
1,Better work is available,"Mr. Glick takes some scandalous events from almost a half a century ago and generalizes liberally (no pun intended). There are numerous anti-establishment groups who have better manuals (Black Bloc, PETA, Greenpeace) on the topic. Individuals who wish to escape monitoring often have an agenda which is not simply counter-culture but likely illegal and harmful to society in general. Brian maintains current information on a number of counter culture websites and his information is terribly out of date. Given the histroy available, there are a number of more relevant sources for the student as well as the radical."
5,Great workbook to go along with the book!,Sandra Brown does it again with a workbook that helps you understand your dating habits and how you choose the people you date.
4,excellent book,Excellent book to help you understand why you keep choosing the same type of unhealthy men and how to watch for the red flags in the future.
5,Awesome!,"We initially purchased one of the 92101 compressors for our service technician to use when doing punch list items for our residential contracting company. The ability to walk into an occupied residence, without the cumbersome larger compressor/ hose/ cords etc. , was the main reason we wanted to try this unit out. The added benefit turned out to be how quiet the unit is when operating. Although it is not a rapid fire machine, it served its purpose well for random pieces of trim or a cabinet detail we needed to apply. We have since purchased three more of the units for our project managers to carry with them in case of a last minute punch list type item or small trim detail that doesn't require a lot of nailing to install. For our applications, the product has performed very well."
5,Worth every cent. STOP!!!! Had to edit original reveiw......,"I am so happy with the Palmgren tankless compressor. STOP!!!!! I had to edit my review for the following reason. Please read on before buying this cheap piece of s**t. I thought this was a good product until I used it a 3rd time. Then it died on me. I handled it with the utmost care and it just stop working. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF C**P! I'm just lucky I was able to finish the bathroom project before it died. DON'T BUY IT!!!!!! I would have removed the star rating, but I couldn't change them. DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!!!!"
2,Problem with batteries,"for me the machine is good,but those batteries discharger by inselfand I need explanation why,and other problem is :I try to find batteries for saleto replace,but is imposible to find.please helpme to find a batt or I has to returned, and if any kind of batteryhas to discharge is better to return.Now This is I beliebed:Those batt your send me was older,why discharge to next day.please answer my question and if you not have answer for this is better to return.Thank youDavid Argueta"
3,Palmgren 92101 HipShot 12-volt Ni-Cad Tankless Cordless Shoulder Strap Compressor,"I suggest you dont shop on amazon after you've been drinking. i bought this with great intentions, but i have still not even taken it out of the box. Looks good though. If you want to buy mine, Contact me!"
4,Good for small projects,"I used this portable compressor this weekend. Quality is good, minimal wieght and you can't beat the price. I used it with my finish nailer as well as to shoot 1 9/16 staples in a arbor that was falling apart. The unit recharged quickly but came on after every shot. I tried 3 shots with the stapler in a row and it worked fine each time. I like this compressor better than the Jac Pac. I returned the Jac pac and got this and i am very happy.This is prefect tool for small jobs around the house."
3,compressor,"Pressureswitch never worked, unit doesn1t cycle. Machine works fine on manual switching. How do I get a press. switch replacement ?"
1,the chuck grabs bits off center a lot...,"I bought this drill to replace my heavily used 10 year old 12V Dewalt that served me very very well. I am dissapointed because this drill slows me down a lot compared to my previous Dewalt. For some reason, this Dewalt has a much greater propensity to grab drill bits off center. I used to juggle bits fast with my old Dewalt while I must slow down and retry often with this new Dewalt. Maybe I just got a lemon. Maybe Dewalt has lost some of their excellence of late."
4,Fine for what it is,We buy these 14.4 volt tools to be used by minimally trained technicians after the jobs are complete. They are inexpensive and reliable. They perform simple tasks just fine.
3,Less than 50 sing along songs,"There are 50 songs on this CD, but maybe about 1/2 are actually sing-along songs (sung at a slower pace). The rest of the songs are at the normal fast pace. I was expecting the entire CD to be sing-along songs. It's okay, but not what I expected. However, for the super low price it's a great CD."
5,Sing along fun for everyone,I heard this so many times I enjoy singing with my daughter. Very fun to sing the old and new songs.
2,boring with little variation,"This cd is not what I expected. every song is sung in the same way. the songs are sung with quiet voices, no inflection or excitement in any of the songs. after a while they all just sound the same. my granddaughter likes it for about one or two songs and then she is done with it."
3,Not my favorite,This CD is okay but not one of my favorites. The singing is a bit annoying after a while.
3,nice gift,I never actually saw this product for myself since I sent it to someone as a gift. But he did say that he liked it.
2,I've Got a Little List,"If you know nothing about G&S before you purchase this book, this book is a good introduction. It will take you about 30 minutes to complete. The graphics and photos are well done. However, if you are a musician and want more than merely an introduction, this is not the book for you."
1,DESCRIPTION IS INCORRECT!!,This is not the Brazillian Cast Recording of Phantom of the Opera (I bought it and found this out at my expense) such an official soundtrack doesnt currently exist!The tracks on this are actually sung in English by people with foreign accents (Brazillian perhaps...)...Don't waste your money!
1,Waste of Money,"I must admit I didn't know much about this dvd when purchasing it as there was no write up on it.If you like live crappy recordings then this would be great for you.If you like the original music video clips then this wont be for you, as I found out.This is just my view only.Jas."
1,IPAQ USER,I found this to be a very disappointing product! A collection of freeware/shareware/trial programs that are available for download at no cost. The only decent programs on the disc were trial versions that will require additional payment to be used beyond a short trial period.
2,Not what it seems,"I purchased 50 power programs for pocket PC ... . I am very glad I did not have to pay for this software, as almost all of the programs are free/share ware available on the internet. There are some nice programs, and if you have a slow internet connection, getting this will save some download time, otherwise search around ... and download the Poctet PC software that appeals to you.A word of warning - it appears as many of the programs will not work on any older PPC (ie, Casiopeia, HP 500 series) besides the Compaq iPAQ."
4,Sublime With Hip Hop,"I live in Long Beach, so I have been treated to seeing bands like Long Beach Dub Allstars and Sublime mature and grow into great groups. But for god's sake! Why can't my wonderful city produce any bands that aren't ska/reggae/rock/punk combos? Bargain Music are not Sublime, they are completely different, but they still fit into the same genre. This is the music Sublime would make if they got a couple of MCs and a regular DJ. There are loads of rap overtones, but the music always resorts back into ska-ish choruses. There is also a very strange bluegrass element to the music, but thankfully it is not a major problem. Overall this disc is alright, and What Do You Do? and Lipliner stand out the most in my mind trackwise. They are still basically just a band following a very small trend that only exists in Long Beach. Also check out Long Beach Dub Allstars."
2,"more like ""rip off music""","seriously, a huge dissapointment. please stop disrespecting the likes of Sublime, Slightly Stoopid, and LBDA by comparing them to this almost unlistenable CD."
4,Havens Grace Of The Sun,All Along The Watchtower is worth the price of admission. I saw him perform this as his opening track in Birmingham and had to find this version of the song. Not as powerful as Hendrix's rendition of the Dylan classic but very strong with a great voice and guitar playing.
4,Good Movie,One of favorite Soap opera actress is in this movie. So I wanted to see her performance so I buy this movie
4,"Well made, good power , a bit finicky","How well you like these will totally depend on what you want to use them for. They have great pulling power once they get a grip. I purchased it for trying to pull out a car door dent. One thing to note on most of the lever action operated suction cups is that they cannot form to irregular surfaces very well. The sides of the cups are not very tall like ones specifically made for dent pulling. I tried this double cup unit on a car windshield and the curvature of the glass pretty much would not allow it to develop suction. I had to use bearing grease to get either of the larger ones I bought to develop suction on a slightly bent panel on the car door that was otherwise very smooth. Once it got a grip, it felt pretty good, but was prone to slide due to the grease. Never got the door dent out due to the slickness of the grease, but couldn't get a seal without it. Probably would be bomber on FLAT glass or tile."
4,Great Value,When I ordered this item I was a little concerned about the quality (you get what you pay for they always say) but when I got it and started to use it I really liked it. Getting the phone in and out was a little difficult at first (tight fitting) but after a week or two it stated to loosen up and works great.I would recommend this item to anyone with a Blackberry who wants to get something better then the included belt clip.
4,Good coverage of the art and business of airbrushing nails,"This book covers all the bases and gives good detail into the techniques, materials, and supplies required in the business of airbrushing nails. Several illustrations help guide you through some of the step-by-step processes. I would recommend this book to anyone who is seriously contemplating running a nail airbrushing business or is a serious hobbyist, even if you already have experience in airbrushing."
3,Overpriced,"My nail technician didn't learn an awful lot from this book, overpriced for what it is in my honest opinion."
5,Better than my finger,"I recently purchased a Kindle Fire but was having some difficulty getting my 66 year-old finger to get it to respond properly. I read about using a stylus on touch-screen devices and decided to give this one a try. It works great! I now have no difficulty making selections or scrolling. I am so glad I found out about it. I especially like the clip (like a pen) and small size that is easy to grasp, like a pen. I clip it to the elastic band on my Kindle Fire case when not in use so it is always ready and easily found."
2,cheaply made,"i have read three books and the top is already worn. i really think it is cheaply made and not worth the money. it turns oages, but that's all its accurate for."
5,excellent product,Received the stylus in 2days in good condition. Started using it immediately for text entry. It worked will's increasing my entry speed greatly. I'm very happy with this product.
5,Works Well,"I recently purchased my first touchscreen tablet, the Kindle Fire HD and love it. However, sometimes the items I wanted to select were so small that I had to enlarge the text to be able to select it, then downsize it back when I was done. So I purchased this stylus and found I could select without having to enlarge the text and it also is great for the kids who tend to get my screen all smudged up. Very nice style at a very nice price."
3,OLD FASHIONED BUT STILL NICE,"It catches your attention because it's based in the classic Oscar Wilde's THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ERNEST. It's not a great musical, has no catchy melodies but still it's nice to hear. It's a product specially appealing to musical collectors and teachers of English Literature who can get a look at the possibilities of Literature classics adapted into musicals."
3,Pro Publisher,"Lots of information and utilities, but difficult to follow. However, it's tough to beat the price for what you get!"
4,Not too bad (if bought used),"I purchased a ""used"" copy for about $9 since v20 is out and is almost $90. I'm not disappointed with it since it does just what I want it to do: Labels, Newsletter, envelopes. Things that were a challenge in Microsoft products like Word, etc. I was very pleased with it, but then I didn't spend a whole lot. I'll get v20 when I can get it for $9 but then maybe the current version at that time will have been improved enough to be worth it."
5,"Finally, a market driven answer to the challenges we face","I'm halfway through Martin's book and it's refreshing to read about technology and the markets in determining our future. The ""T"" Generation gets it, let's hope the rest of us listen."
3,A good rough draft in need of an editor,"Some interesting material here, but poorly, poorly organized. Especially in the second half. Repetitive to a fault. Desperately needs footnotes, or an annotated bibliography. Too much unsubstantiated data. Also naive, especially when it comes to topics such as engineered foods, fruits, vegetables, etc. Scientists aren't going to engineer the tastiest variety. To heck with taste - as we have seen abundant evidence of in such foods so far - if it gets in the way of being easy to pick, having a long shelf life, insect resistance or the profit motive. This book is a good launching pad for further research by more credible sources, on the topics it raises."
5,"Anticipating futures, both amazing and awful.","I came across Martin's book while searching for articles relative to future trends. I can't imagine a more comprehensive review of possibilities in our global future. For anyone who wants to be aware of the awesome possibilities awaiting people in the 21st century as well as the obstacles to getting there, this book is a must read. I've given a copy to my 22 year old son who's majoring in international justice and human rights in college. I see this book as a guide for him and others of his generation in addressing the future. I plan to get more copies to share as a way of influencing those who will inherit the world my generation (baby boomers) have created with all its potential for good and for disaster."
1,Scratch and Sniff,"One of the only enlighting things I found out about this Manga was it has a 'scratch and sniff' cover, which smells like Strawberry Shortcake (which smells so yummy!) but the overall story and art is it's downfall. I read about 20 pages and got bored, so I'm selling it online. There is no depth to the characters and no real engaging plot. There is only some Slash and Shonen Ai parts for fans, but it won't satisfy a Yaoi Fan. I suggest looking out for Cafe Kichijouji."
3,Like watching bread rise,"The artwork in this book is kinda plain and the story doesn't really go much of anywhere. There are three distinct main characters, but you don't really care much about who they are and what they're doing. Hopefully, future volumes will have more ""action"" in every sense of the word."
2,Not Yaoi per say...a Boring tag along...,"Screen tones, some Gay innunedo, and being licensed from Japan do not a yaoi manga make. That being said, it could've come with a chocolate scratch and sniff cover and I still wouldn't have kept it open.If you're a fan of yaoi with some edge, avoid this title. If you're a mild fan of BL [yaoi without the edge], borrow this title, don't buy it, for it hardly qualifies as yaoi."
5,This was a surprise,"While looking thru Pink Martini and Paris Combo music, I came across Paolo Conte. Just to be safe, I got this 'Best of' selection.What a surprise! He is the Italian boogie-woogie man. My children are a little bit embrassed when I try to sing along in our minivan, but I don't care. This 'album' is my favorite of the year."
5,Exceptional,"I first heard about Paolo Conte in the mid 90s, when I heard a live recording of Via Con Me. My friend mentioned that she had to fight with her ex-husband when they were divorcing about who would get the live recordings of Paolo Conte.His work is now easily accessible for all of us to enjoy. It is very difficult for me to categorize his work, not that it needs to be categorized. However, it has elements of blues, jazz, and perhaps some opera and is brilliant. This album is a collection of his best and includes the famous Via Con Me, though I think by no means is Sparring Partner any less significant piece of work."
5,A must for all Jazz and Italian music lovers!,"Paolo Conte's music reminds me a bit of Leonard Cohen and of New Orleans jazz...Italian style. A crowd pleaser to all, Conte's music is perfect for all occasions and moods. Said from a true Italian, if you are insatiable for Italian musica and have yet to hear this guy, then you are missing out!!!"
5,Paolo Conte is unique in any language.,"The obvious comparison is to Tom Waits, but Paolo Conte shares similarities with other iconoclasts like Van Morrison, Nick Cave, and even Captain Beefheart. Once the charming novelty has worn off, what you're left with is a collection of awesome tunes. My two favorites are ""Colleghi trascurati"" and ""Sparring Partner"": eerie and beautiful, and if these were the only two good songs on the CD, I'd still recommend it highly. However, there are other tunes every bit as memorable: ""Elisir,"" ""Dragon"" (with its Thelonious Monk-like solo), ""Ho ballato di tutto,"" ""Via con me,"" and more. This CD is so strong that I'm convinced that even a 20-song compilation can't do Conte justice, and like me you'll probably want to start looking for the individual CDs. (Having said that, I still believe this is the album to start off with.)"
5,great Italian jazz,"I love Paolo Conte's voice and sense of rhythm. I found out about him by watching both movies Mickey Blue Eyes and Mostly Martha and I am hooked. The song Via Via is so compelling that I often listen to it 3 or 4 times in a row. Another plus: the words of the songs are included in the album, so I can follow and learn Italian in the process."
5,"Funny, Sad, Romantic, Silly--Completely Entertaining","A melange of styles, with Conte's grumbly vocals in common. Is he an Italian Tom Waits? A Frank Sinatra wannabe? A man in love with love? A pretender? Or the real thing? Yes. And, it doesn't matter. Enjoy the infectious melodies and lyrics."
4,Best of,Like always Paolo rocks. If you like this kind of music.There are some great tunes on this CD. A must have for every italian contemporary fan.
3,Eh...,"I always get my hopes up with these bubble pack radios but basicaly they're all toys. 5 watts, my elbow! ERP is only 1.515 watts. (GXT400's ERP is 2.004 watts!!!) Range from car to house in neighborhood area is about a mile. I'm sure on unobstructed terrain or over water the range would fair better. NOAA WX is a nice feature. Scan feature is just OK. Honestly, get the GXT400's if your bent on bubble packs. Oh, and get your GMRS license!!"
5,Midwest Life-Stages 36-by-24-by-27-Inch Triple-Door Folding Metal Dog Crate,"I received your cage and it is wonderful!..i was on the phone and i put it together with one hand..very easy to lift up to put together..all you do is lift up the sides!!..it is very nice..it has 3 doors..a front, back and side door so it is very accessable to get your dog..A great deal!!"
2,Hardly an introduction....,"I'm a software developer, and have more than an avocational interest in probability. I wanted to get into the discipline proper and try to learn about probability as if I were a student in college again. This book reads like wading through waist deep bubble gum. I had to read the first couple pages about 10 times before I really understood what was going on. This book may be a good ""Introduction"" if you've already got a degree in math or statistics, but if you want to learn about probability from the ground up, start somewhere else."
5,Very realistic sound of raindrops and some thunder,"I have bought every recording of rain that Amazon.com has had for-sale. This recording by Dr. Thompson is the best and most realistic sound of rain with some distant thunder that I have ever heard.There are no loud, obnoxious bird or cricket sounds as with some other recordings. Dr. Thompson's recording is the steady sound of rain drops and some distant sounding thunder. It is very relaxing to listen."
5,"Students "" I-de-ate""","I teach fifth grade in California. Sometimes it's difficult for them to come back into the classroom after recess and get settled down, ready for the next lesson. I picked up on a term I heard on tv (which they all know about this term)and I use it to my advantage. They love it and look forward to coming in and ""Ideate"" (I - de - ate) When they come back into the classroom I have one of my disk on the player at a low volume and let them just ""Ideate"" for 3-5 minutes. The length of time varies depending on their state of excitement. They can chose where to Ideate. On a table, the floor is popular, just sitting at their desk with their heads-down, etc. Believe me it works. A teacher's blessing."
2,too much rain noise,I love the sound of thunderstorms and that is what I thought I was getting with this cd. When I started the cd I had to turn the volume up really high to get anything and all I got was a lot of rain and then finually some thunderstorm noise in the back ground. Too much rain noise for me.
4,Nice sound,"Great for relaxing to the thunderstorm sound and not having additional distracting music. I'm not crazy for the portion with bird chirping, and the couple of minutes of bee buzzing is a bizarre addition, my opinion.That said, this is my second time purchasing this product. My first CD was scratched during a trip and I missed having it.If this had been made without the addition of the 'birds and the bees', I would've easily given 5 stars."
3,Adhesive Tape Remover,"I ordered this product for home use. The product I really wanted necessitated a huge bulk order. This product does seem to work but is a bit oily. However, it does work and perhaps has other uses other than the one intended."
1,how bad can it [ just bad],"got a 321studio x maker, boy did deliver. an how it delived? let me tell you. help, what help! after about a week just removed it. could not get it to copy a movie, could not get any help from 321 studio. went an got windvd creator 2 platnum at amazon at half the price. down loads from dv recorder [sony] burns moveis to dvd or to vcr"
3,This one's alright.,"This software is essentially the same as DVD Complete that was owned by Dazzle which is no longer in business. The problem with this software is that it does not support widescreen (16:9 ratio) format. It only supports the standard screen (4:3 ratio) format, and that sucks."
1,Waste of money!!!!!,"I bought this product hoping to get a better program than what I was using.It sounded really good but it never stated I couldn't use my usb capture device.What a waste,and support has much to be desired.Save your money."
1,Cleverly written but not true.,"Nicholas Fitzgerald's biography about the founder and musical genius of The Rolling Stones was certainly a page turner but one has to question the truth to his story. Fitzgerald, a Guiness heir, claimed to have been close friends to Brian Jones during height of Stonesmania in the mid 60's, to his accidental drowning, or should I say murder, in July 1969. For a person who was as close to Brian Jones as Fitzgerald claims, one has to wonder why his name is mentioned in no other books written about the star or books about The Rolling Stones. People who were close to Brian Jones and the Stones during this time such as former lovers Marianne Faithfull, Anita Pallenberg and close personal friends have never mentioned or heard of Fitzgerald. The book was cleverly written but not true."
5,Beyond amazing,"I recently saw OWL live in Georgia and they OWNED. Selena's voice is beyond amazing the guitar, the drums, everything is just amazing. ""Damage"" is probably one of the best songs I've ever heard, it has great lyrics AND it's catchy. I suggest picking this CD up pronto!"
2,"Bad gunplay, Stealth and AI","I regret buying this game, the story was so uninspiring and i never cared for Sam Fisher. The AI is bad and when you feel like you were very stealthy they'll see you anyways.I would avoid this game, but for a game that's less than $10 not to bad of a deal."
2,No. Just no.,"The storyline, intrigueing as it might be, is simply overcome by slow and laggy controls, bad camera, poor framerates, the action simply is not smooth.You find yourself missing takedowns because of graphical slowdowns and input lag.The story is tight but the actual technical product sucks.It feels like they made this game for a more powerful machine, and the 360 is struggling to run it.-D"
4,This game is worth the money to me,If you like splintercells 1 through choas theory than you will probably like this game. This game is great but it's very challenging. I recommend that you beat it on the normal setting before trying to beat it on the hard setting. Overall The game was fun but the multiplayer is a joke. If anyone is buying this game for the multiplayer than they should think twice.
4,Great game,So far i love this game. I am a little late in getting it but i am working my way back into the series. Its not much different then the other splinter cell games except for the graphics and that's why i enjoy playing.
5,Splinter-Cell: Double Agent,"This is possibly the best Splinter-Cell out today. It has all of the cool gadgets in the older games and includes really top-notch new ones. The graphics are polished, and the storyline feels better. You actually receive your mission orders in realtime in the mission, not before it!"
4,tough stealth game,this game requires a lot of stealth so for shooting/killing action it is pretty slow. i do like the strategy element of figuring out how to use the shadows and the technical equipment to avoid and distract the enemy. this is not a fast play game but if you have time you will enjoy choking out a lot of bad dudes. enjoy
4,"Same game, but not really","God, I love Ubisoft ... how do they keep doing it?I think what I love most about this version of the game for Xbox 360 is that while you're in the same locations as the Xbox v1.0 version, the game play is completely different ... it's as though Ubisoft created two different games.Can't quite give it 5 stars, though, because some of the game play is a pain (like building the bombs in the second visit to the JBA's headquarters ... much more difficult than it had to be) and the story is OK at best.Still, this latest chapter in the Splinter Cell franchise is a welcome addition.Can't wait for the next chapter, Conviction."
2,Not at all what I expected,"This was a total letdown for me. I got this thinking that I'd get a brand new experience playing a game I already had on a different console, but it was too different. Usually with Splinter Cell games I pick up on the controls and the in-game features pretty easily, but this time I was just overwhelmed. It seems like it's too easy to lose/get blown up/get caught. The only upside was the really nice graphics. However, I'm still stuck on the third level, and it looks like I'll be there for a while."
4,Great Game,"If you've played any game in this series then you know what to expect. What separates this series from other series that did not survive the jump to ""next gen"" is that they get it right. I can't think of anything I would change about the game. If you're expecting Doom or Quake then you bought the wrong game. This game is about stealth and accomplishing your goals with the LEAST amount of collateral damage (in most cases). Sure the ""morale choice"" aspect of the game could have had more of an impact but the fact that it doesn't really does not detract from the experience in my opinon. I would definitely recommend this title."
2,Not like other games,"Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six are some of the best games out there - this game isn't like those at all. I'm not doing a direct comparison, but for those that are looking for more along those lines this isn't it. And even review this game by itself, it wasn't that good/fun."
5,Wow. Life changing.,"After reading this book, my prayer life is forever changed. God used this book to teach me that so many Christians are living by the flesh and trying to be sanctified by works. I strongly reommend this book and others that Bill Thrasher have read."
4,Passionate view of prayer,"I purchased this book for my wife. She has found it to be a tender, compassionate look into one's prayer life."
2,Between light and dark,"This is Falco's last album and that's why I bought it. It's not a bad album, not a sublime one either. My feeling is it's too much ecclectic for that. Falco sits in between his eighties grandeur with songs as 'Shake' and 'Hit Me' (this is Falco at his best imo) and a kind of techno based pop songs like 'Mutter' and der 'Kommissar 2000'. He wants to vision the millennium but comes over old-fashioned certainly in a song as 'Cyberlove'. His ballads or real songs are the better moments on this disc ('Out of the dark', 'Egoist'). 'Naked' his worst. I find it too heterogeneous to be a strong album but Falco always has his moments that makes it worth to buy his records."
4,"A really good disc, nearly perfect...nearly","A disc which contains some great songs like Ootd or Revolution, but also one or two weaker songs (cyberlove), but all in all a really good one...something very special four a country like austria, a land where you get to the top fast and fall down even faster"
5,Absolutely Incredible!,"Before hearing gONNA gET gOT, I wouldn't have said that I liked any form of Hip-Hop or Rap, but this CD really changed my view of how it is done. GGG totally rewrites how things should be done in this amazing album(The right way if you ask me!) With tracks that I could more than identify with (""Florence Ivy"" and ""Won't Give up"") and others that simply made me laugh and marvel at how original this artist is(""Lord's Rhyme""). In this cd GGG really takes you through compelling story after story as the tracks play through. This is one of the VERY FEW CDs that I've actually purchased in an incredibly long time, as I didn't feel like just having the MP3s was enough.This is most definitely worth buying, as it is one of the most played albums on my MP3-player, and is one of the most requested CDs at parties. I love ever moment of it."
4,"Nice, but not sturdy","I can tell that this is going to be a very useful book as I ""plan"" my way through my pregnancy. My main complaint is with the quality of the cover. I'm very disappointed! The cover material is barely more sturdy than the inside pages; this is definitely not going to hold up very well. I toss my planners in my purse and carry them around and take them out and I can tell that this is just not going to last. It's a thinner weight even than cardstock and it's not even laminated. If there's a next edition or a reprint, I would highly suggest using a higher quality paper that will actually work with being carried around for 9 months."
4,Great for the first time parent,"I got this for my third child. I was acutally looking for a pregnancy journal that I could keep by months or weeks, not daily. Most of the journals that I checked out required daily entries which is almost impossible with two little boys. I figured If I get an organizer, I might be able to keep a good record that I can actually keep. Well, this is filled with great informations and plenty of space for interviews to choose Obstetrician, midwife, pediatrician, daycare arrangement; detailed shopping list to prepare for the baby; space for childbirth class notes; checklist for the delivery; and even the essential first week's worth of feeding and diapering record charts. This would've been a great thing if I got it for my first born. But I already know which obstetrician and pediatrician to go to, I already own lots of baby stuff, etc. Even though this is a great book, this didn't meet my need. I should've gotten the 'The Belly Book' by Amy Krouse Rosenthal."
3,Hmmm,This is an okay organizer. It seems a little cold. It's weird to say that about something that should have you warm and fuzzy. When I think of pregnancy thats the sort of feeling I get. I want something warm and cheerful to read. Maybe it's the color that puts me off. It does have some beneficial content for a new mother. The use of blue makes it feel very sterile. Blue is cute on the walls and onsies but for some reason not cool in the book. Then again I tend to love the crisp white or off white pages of books more than colored pages. This will give you lists an little places to put your notes and that sort of stuff. So I suppose it accomplishes it purpose and that is all that should matter to most.
1,"Too much information, for the hyper-organized only","I ""used"" this book for one day...there is simply too much to fill-out that really doesn't make pregnancy/labor/delivery any more helpful. The only thing I might use (if anything at all) is the hospital checklist (but there's probably one in my other books anyway). If you like tracking every minute detail of your pregnancy and delivery in yet another place, then consider this book. Otherwise, buy a real journal instead."
4,Great product,"I am 9 weeks pregnant and I love this book. It has lots of information that I would have never even thought of. I love the layout of the book, and I plan on using it throughout my pregnancy."
4,"Great design, has the essentials","I looked at many pregnancy organizers and journals before deciding on this one. What I wanted most was a calendar that I could start at anytime (nothing too structured), a place to track prenatal visits & questions, a place for class notes, and pertinant lists & charts & timelines. This one fits the bill for the most part, but it was really the fact that it wasn't pink with pictures of ducks & puppies that I bought it. What I would like to see is some pockets to hold all the info sheets I get at my appointments (I only found 2 with this feature) and more space for notes."
5,Perfect,"This planner has been essential in getting my husband and I through our first pregnancy. The fill in calendar, midwife/physicial interview and appointment logs in particular have helped to guide us through steps we'd otherwise have been lost in. And unlike other organizers this isn't filled with the authors opinions or point of view- just the essentials.40+ Weeks looks amazing and is easy to take EVERYWHERE but it's so much more to that. It covers everything essential from conception to birth from choosing a care provider and pediatrician to logging baby's feedings after birth. I'm looking forward to using this throughout the rest of my pregnancy and having it as a momento to look back on.Thanks ladies!"
2,A little disappointed,"If you need help choosing and interviewing doctors, mid-wives, nannies, etc., there are many pages dedicated to helping you do so. However, I felt this did not apply to me personally. Also, there aren't enough blank spaces to take notes, just a few lines. I was expecting more space to take day-to-day notes. I ended up buying another journal after using this for a week."
5,Great planner!,"This is a great pregnancy planner/ journal. This is my first baby and I find the different sections about important questions to ask everyone from your doctor, insurance company, pediatrician, childcare all very helpful for a first time mom. The areas to record info from your doctor visits is great, too. I also like the section about what you absolutely need for your new baby and the ""extras"". Good little planner and I definitely like that the cover is very neutral and mod looking-- not all frilly. I do wish there were pockets on the front and back inside covers, but it's still a great planner!!!"
3,"A good planner, but NOT a Journal","I bought this because I did want something what would provide me with checklists so that I would know what to do and when. However, I guess I also thought there would be places for me to record my own thoughts and feelings about the pregnancy, and there is no space for this. This is definitely more of a planner, providing a calendar and to-do functionality, but NOT the place to journal or really note anything personal about the pregnancy at all."
4,Very useful,"I really liked this organizer. It's small, so it's easy to carry around. Because it is spiral bound, it's easy to hold in one hand and fill out with the other. It gave me a place to keep track of all my doctor appointments, questions for my doctor, daycare referals, items I registered for, shower gifts, insurance information, weight gain, potential baby names, etc. It contains a good checklist of to dos organized by month. It helped me prepare my birth plan and pack my hospital bag. It contains great questions to ask when interviewing pediatricians, day care providers, etc. My only criticism is there's only one form for each type of interview. If you interview more than one pediatrician, OBGYN, midwife, daycare provider, etc, you have to photocopy the pages and fill out the photocopies. They should include 3 copies of each form in the organizer. It also has a place to keep track of diapering and feeding post-birth, although I didn't use that. Overall, a great product."
4,Great gift for mother-to-be,Bought this book for my sister because she's a little bit unorganized. So far she's been raving about the book and how helpful it has been as she is getting ready to have her first baby. I recommend it!
3,This was ok,"This was ok but it was not completely satisfactory. I really liked how it gave lots of good advice in many respects, from finding a pediatrician to recording gifts received from the shower, but I would have liked to have a journal section (I had to pretty much make my own) to record some of my most important pregnancy experiences. Perhaps it was because I had a lot to say, but I was disappointed with that. Also the sections they had for you to record your doctor visits were somewhat limited for me. other than that, it was a really good resource."
2,Not what I expected,"The book review indicates that this ""palnner"" will help you all the way. For new moms who don't know exactly when to do things or what to do. So I bought it with this expectation and in reality I didn't find that much of a guide."
3,Too Detailed,"I found the organiser very good with suggestion and lots of space for interviewing doctors, obstetrician, midwife, care givers and not enough room for the actual 40 weeks calendar to record your personal journey. I realise it is a organser and not a journal however a little extra in this section would of been better."
3,"Decent, not great","I consider myself to be a fairly organized and detail-oriented individual; however, I found this guide to be more overwhelming than helpful. It contains extremely detailed and lengthy interviews to conduct with everyone from your OB to a potential nanny or babysitter. There are lists upon lists of items to register for and/or purchase. It is just more information than I personally need. If you want to control every last detail of your entire pregnancy and birth, I'm sure this organizer will help you feel like you are doing that, but be careful that you don't set yourself up for disappointment. Everything rarely goes exactly as planned and being a little more flexible and a little less organized might be a good thing."
2,Not what I expected,"I am very organized and thought that this book would walk me through what I should be doing when throughout my pregnancy. However, I don't find it all that useful at all. It provides detailed interview questions for doctors and child care options, but other than that, it doesn't really provide a timeline on what an expectant mother should be doing when. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this book."
3,No journal pages,"I like the book. Lots of info and nice layout, only I wish there were blank journal pages to record certain events. Great check list for hospital and baby preparation."
5,"love it, love it, love it.","This is the pregnancy journal I have been waiting for. It's classy, modern and chock full of great check lists and information. Like nothing else I've seen available. Love it, Love it, Love it...and you will too!"
4,Nice to have one place for baby info and tracking,"Not everything is useful (for me) but enough so that I think it's worth the purchase. I like to have a place to keep track of appointments, weight, gifts, etc and this does that nicely."
4,"So far, so good!","This is a wonderful organizer for the newly pregnant woman and, while this is my first pregnancy, it is a useful tool for questions and concerns I didn't even think about.The only issues I have that I hope the publishers change in the future: add more space for writing & random notes. Put MORE pockets in the book. And the binding is TERRIBLE! I went to Kinko's and had it rebound to a more sturdy and reliable binding...this thing was falling apart because I was opening/closing it every day!Other than that, it is just wonderful!"
4,Very Practical,"I was very pleased with this organizer. It's not a lot of fun but its very practical. There is room for a few pictures and a couple of pages about your cravings and reactions, which were fun. Maybe a few too many pages on things like OB, midwife, daycare and nanny interviews. But, if your looking for something that covers all your bases this is a great organizer, it really made me feel....put together and organized!"
3,Almost everything you need...,"Well I just got this book and looked through every page. There is quite a bit of information, checklists, interview forms, etc...For the most part this book will help you get and stay organized for the pregnancy and delivery.If however you are having a c-section, you won't find much information specific to you. For example, I know that having a stool softener is meant to ease any pain post-surgery but it isn't on any list in this book.[...] For the average pregnancy, this book is pretty good, better than the others I previewed before purchasing, but for us c-section moms, you'll need to research a few things and make additions to the packing lists and questions lists."
2,Not very well made,"While I like the idea of the planner, I felt that it wasn't very well made. The cover is flimsy and seems that after nine months could become easily damaged. I also felt like it was difficult to written in because of the akward binding and cover. I also didn't feel like there was enough room in the area to record items that need to be purchased, there wasnt enough room to compare products only to write which products I had decided on.I would not recommend this planner."
2,Not What I Expected,"I am an organizer and I thought this would be a great book. It has a few ideas and links that are helpful, but nothing that is not on the pregnancy websites. It is to organize your information, but there is not enough space to write your information down."
4,Great organizer,"There is a ton of info you can record to organize now and even keep later as a momento. My only complaint: It has one clear page to store things. I wish it had flap pockets on the front and back cover or more than one clear page to store more items if you wish, such as sonogram pictures or other pictures. Otherwise, it is a fantastic organizer/planner!"
4,"Nice to have, but not a necessity","I got this organizer when about 6 weeks pregnant and found it pretty interesting. It's definitely helpful - all the checklists and questionnaires are general and will work for most girls, but I find the space left for answers a little short. Also the calendar part is very limited (you get a little square -less than an inch, per day), so I had to come up with a system of little codes to track my pregnancy symptoms (NS - nausea, HA - headache, etc). It works well this way.On the other hand, the part that allows you to keep track of your prenatal visits is extensive. You get fetal movement charts, diaper charts, very extensive baby needs shopping lists, etc.Overall, it's a cool pregnancy gadget, would make a nice gift for expecting moms."
5,A Must for the Type A,"This is not a journal. I didn't have time to journal during my pregnancy as I was super busy. But this was helpful to keep track of appointments and checklists. It made me feel more prepared and confident. It was also helpful to keep all the notes from child birth class to doctors appointments to thanks yous from the baby shower all in one place. I would not recommend this to people that aren't into planners or lists, but for us Type As, this is a must!"
5,"""And There Was Light"" is abundently superb.","Startling in its intelligence, moral power, and sheer beauty, this text is a treasure for both the seasoned wise and the passionate young. Lusseyran was a man of rare talent and courage; his untimely death in 1971 saw the loss of one of Earth's freest and wisest souls. May our children and our children's children have the privilege of reading his remarkable story."
1,Where was the proofreader?,"I am on page 4 of the Kindle version, and I can't get past the misspellings (""there"" instead of ""their"") and the many typos (missing letters or wrong letters). It promises to be a truly wonderful story, but the errors are so distracting that I am sorry to have purchased this one for my Kindle. I will probably see if I can get it from the library and revise the rating when I do."
2,Well....,"Earlier, when I was really into Zen, I did not like this book. But Buddhism says, that the world is disliiusionment, and disillusionment also applys to Buddhism, especially Western Buddhism. AfterZen descrtibes such an disillusioning, and unfortunately he has a point.Th book should get 4 stars, but I could not reedit that..."
2,For Zen eyes only...,"I found this book self-indulgent, with Van de Wetering butting his head against the same wall (koans?) here as he was in his book of forty years ago (The Empty Mirror) and I had this enlightening thought, ""Perhaps this concept of Zen is a dead end and, in the end, we are left only with ourselves."""
3,A Dissenting Voice In A Chorus Of Praise,"Van de Wetering is a humorous and prolific author, admired by many, and easy to read; and his subject -- a westerner wrestling with Zen and its koans -- is intriguing. Even his eventual disillusionment can be instructive. Some would say his rejection of Zen and of meaning is the highest attainment of Zen; he would probably call this foolishness. Van de Wetering began with a nihilism arising out of World War II trauma and came to Zen looking to have it confirmed. He doesn't acknowledge much his own contributions to his bad experience with Zen, but comes to us with stories of other disillusioned students and of the failings and foibles, scandals and tragedies of Zen masters and other religious leaders, wanting perhaps us to confirm his disenchantment. But for me at least the self-justifying telling of these sad tales eventually undermines the humor, and the book becomes more distasteful than enjoyable or enlightening."
2,opening too small,"I bought these in a size 12 for my husband who wanted a pair of slip-ons and loves his DMs. It was very difficult for him to work his feet into the shoes and it seemed like the opening is just too small. When they were on he said they were very comfortable but still, who wants to sit and struggle with putting their 'slip-ons' on? Within two to four wears, the gusset at the side had started to split open. We ended up sending them back."
2,mediocre,"This keyboard is mediocre. It functioned OK for me, but I had trouble touch typing because all the keys are too similar in size with no spacing to separate the different key groupings. The touch pad scrolling was a bit finicky but maybe that's because I wasn't used to it. Overall the keyboard doesn't have a nice ""feel"". I ended up returning it."
1,$53 Paper weight,"I need a good keyboard touchpad, this inferior product jumps the cursor around opening and closing windows, someone suggested repairing the crimped USB wires inside, I repaired the wires but the problem still exists.It seems Adesso products are too flawed for consumer use.I will never purchase Adesso again and recommend buyers to beware of this company's inferior products.Adesso deserves 0 stars but I had to choose 1"
4,Nice Keyboard,"Overall please with this keyboard, I enjoy the extra touch pad features it comes with (which can also be disabled). Its been in service for almost a year with no problems. The only think I don't like is the physical feel of the unit, it has a very old style and the mouse buttons makes that popping sound when pressed."
1,Terrible keyboard,"I had a version of this same keyboard that I bought in 2007. It worked great for 3 years. The new version is nothing like the original one. Adesso has really decided to go for lower quality. This new keyboard has many problems:1. There is no control key on the right hand side.2. The new chipset used by Adesso does not allow keys on the keyboard to be remapped by Windows. Because of the way they combine information from the touchpad and the keyboard over a single USB interface, they cannot support key remapping. The old keyboard did not have this problem.3. The keys do not push cleanly making typing awkward.4. The product feels cheaply made.5. While using this keyboard, my PC would freeze several times a day. I did not have this problem before using the keyboard, and after I stopped using the keyboard, I did not have this problem."
2,Corruptive touch-tapping cannot be disabled.,"The potentially corruptive touch-tapping feature/bug cannot be disabled. This causes unintentional button clicks and possible data loss.I have contacted Adesso, and they replied that there is no way to disable this behaivior.Touch-tapping is especially harmful when in a browser or word processing program, where a unintentional click can mean accidental deletes or purchases.I recommend against purchase of this device, and recommend to Adesso, that this behaiviour be disabled by default, and only enabled via software/driver."
3,"Just okay keyboard, trackpad too touchy for my use, cheap feel to construction","I purchased this keyboard to help with a limited range of motion and some lack of sensation in fingertips. Because of its small size I thought it would help, however the touchppad was way too sensitive. Typing with the heels of my hands resting left and right of the touchpad, getting my fingers near the touchpad ""set it off"". This might have been a ""learning curve"" issue but was too annoying for me. I still have the keyboard but use it with a mouse instead of using the touchpad now that my range of motion is somewhat better. Maybe it's set up wrong in software... not really a ""plug and play"" touchpad for one who's used to a mouse, and the glidepoint touchpad is much more sensitive than my Dell laptop's trackpad. One plus: it seems to work the same with a Mac and a PC. Might be fast and wonderful if the touchpad use is ever mastered."
2,arrow funtions,Trying to get tech support is a joke . Just purchased and the arow keys dont funtion properly. Can't walk or run in a circle for gameing. Also likes to jumble sentances. Anyone here know how these problems are fixed??
2,"Low quality, erratic operation.","I purchased this keyboard simply to use as a spare when doing quick installations or work on a HTPC. I would say I got a few good months out of it, simply using it here and there (maybe a week at a time).Over time, it began to become very erratic with the mouse moving itself on the screen several inches at a time (without any hands even being on the keyboard!) and even started to randomly right-click constantly.. After a while, it became impossible to even type with the thing..Build quality is also pretty low. The keyboard feels fragile overall and based on the reviews of other people, I can see this is a widespread problem.."
3,Smaller than I expected,"This book was smaller than I expected. A small book with lots of small pictures. Kind of disappointing. Other books on cottages and second homes do the job getter. I have found these are my favorites:* Second Home: Finding Your Place in the Fun. This is comprehensive, large, with great shots of homes in all styles and shots of their settings too. Great to look at but filled with tips on everyting from finding a location to decorating.* The Cabin. Gorgeous, big pictures, lots of variety in the cabins shown. Not a lot in the way of information. But pretty."
3,Mary Emmerling's American Country Cottages,It's a cute book with some nice photographs. A nicer addition to my collection of Mary's books. It would make a nice gift!
5,Pearls of wisdom,"Really, really powerful. I learned that at the end, simplicity is about being courageous and choosing to say no to a heavy workload of urgent stuff and stupidity, so to invest time on what is really important."
1,Am I Reading The Same Book?,I'm wondering if the book that downloaded is the same book these other reviewers read. This book was recommended as part of a simplicity project I've been voluntold (told I volunteered) for at work.I was hoping for some concrete suggestions on how to simplify. Instead there is ALLOT of repetitive material which to me had very little substance. If I bought this at a traditional brick and mortar store I'd be returning it.Save your money and more important your time!!!
4,Simply Amazing!,"Slake's Limbo is an entrancing story about a dull boy known as (Aremis) Slake that must survive in the New York subway. During his perilous journey of hiding in the subway, he finds ways to shelter himself, make money for food, and blend in with the clutter of people.Felice Holman (the author) has quite a way to catch your attention and make the story come out of the pages in this very well written and thrilling historical fiction. I think anyone age nine and up or people who just plainly love survival stories will deeply enjoy this book."
1,Boring,I had to read this in read class in 7th grade. It was just a boring waste of time and didn't even make sense. I didn't even like any of the characters. At least it wasn't very long though.
3,NOT 5TH GRADE READING LEVEL,"I READ THIS BOOK IN MY 8TH GRADE READING CLASS, AND AM SURPRISED THAT IT IS ONLY A 5TH GRADE READING LEVAL THE VOCABULARY IS ADVANCED FOR A 5TH GRADER AND MANY OF THE SCEANS (SLAKES DREAM ABOUT THE BIRD FOR EXAMPLE) ARE NOT VERY CLEAR I DON'T THINK A 10 OR 11 YEAR OLD WOULD UNDERSTAND HOW THE BIRD REPREASENTS FEAR. ALSO FOR KIDS WHO DON'T LIVE IN A BIG CITY AND MAY HAVE NEVER BEEN IN A SUBWAY IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND.I MYSELF ONLY UNDERSTOOD IT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN IN BOSTON SUBWAYS. ON A MORE POSITIVE NOTE THE BOOK IS FILLED WITH CHARACTER AND CONTENT FOR OLDER KIDS WHO WILL UNDERSTAND IT."
2,"I'm very ,very,bored","No, I didn't like the book. It had no action. It was unrealistic. Slake ran away,and nobody looked for him. He never talks, and he has a friend that is a rat?That doesn't make sense. Slake sells newspapers for food, he works really hard. I think that if he went home to his sort of Aunt that he would have a better life."
2,Get a Frappachino Instead,"This book by Felice Holman has no direct plot, besides riding the subway and seling newspapers that is. Because there was no action that caught your eye, it is very easy to put down. Even so, some people may want to relax and pretend to be Slake, riding through the subway. Not very adventurous, but if you're the type, read the book. If not, go get a Frappachino, it's much better for your money."
1,Not a good book. Arrrggh.....,"To me Slakes Limbo didn't appeal to me. What's up with the rat? Where is he at the end of the book? I still don't know the answers to these questions. The book didn't develop any unique taste. The same happenings usually occured everyday. Slake is an interesting person but because you don't really know anything about him. I my mind I think Slake is a tiny boy that sells newspapers to his friend a Cleaning lady and a man with a turban. His best friends a rat and he has a job sweeping at a Diner. What does that tell you about Slake,that he likes rats. Well tell if you figure out why Slake dreams about pigs and birds and his best friend is a subway rat."
1,Absolutly Ghastly,"This book is not well written. Slake's outlook on life is depressing, he has no friends and no life. He lives on the in the subway with no one. He never talks because he is ALWAYS dreaming. This book has little to no plot at all, and it is amazingly boring and badly written. I do not understand how this book got so many good reviews. I was very disappointed. I am not saying this book is sad, it is absolutly deppressing. This book is too hard to believe because it makes me wonder, ""How could any human being live like that?"" This is not an interesting topic to write about. If you want a book with action, go read a different book."
1,AGGGGGG!,"This so called book called book Slakes Limbo, was one of the most terrible book in this world! I was forced to read this ""book"" for school and it was the worst experience in my life! THE MEMORIES!!!!!!!"
1,Bad Idea,"I feel that Slake's Limbo has a bad influence on kids of all ages because of giving the idea of being able to escape to an underground subway to get away from troubles. When books and schools need to give the idea of not running away from problems but solving them. Fifth graders probably won't know that this story is fiction or not true and they will try to escape somewhere and try to survive in the environment by doing some of the things that Slake did. They also probably will get the idea that something can live inside of you and ""peck"" at your ribs. Therefore they could get nightmares or be afraid of something going into their stomachs. I think that the book gives bad ideas to kids. Don't let younger children get ahold of the book."
3,Book Review Slake's Limbo,"Hostile, Spell-bounding and heart pounding! These are the elements of Slake's Limbo, by Felice Holman. This story is about a young man, about 13 years old, running away into the cruel violence of the New York City Subways. No, it has nothing to do with the dance Limbo. Slake tries to pick up some quick cash by selling newspapers to citizens, but a strange man wearing a turban is on to Slake and how he is stealing the newspapers! Now not only does this kid have to survive in a cruel environment, he has to hide his identity from suspicious city folk. This is VERY INTENSE! In conclusion, Slake's Limbo is a suspenseful and fun book."
3,Book Review for Slake's Limbo,House lost... Hiding in a subway...Fearful world. This is what happens in Slake's Limbo By Felice Holman. Slake is a depressed kid in New York City who hates his home life. He runs away and tries to live in a subway. His subway life consists of selling newspapers to very strange people while waiting for their trains. Also sweeping the floor at a small luncheonette. It is an adventurous story that will keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire book. One day Slake goes down to his subway home and sees caution tape around the subway platform that would get him to his home in the wall. The wonders that are running through his mind at this time are never ending. Will he ever get back to his home in the subway or would he have to go back home...Will his life ever be the same.. Find out in this ecsatic book!!!
4,The Best Book Ever!!,"How would you feel if the only place you can live is under a subway? Well slake from the book, ""Slake's Limbo"" had to face being chased and beaten every day, until he found a little hole in the subway tunnel. This book has a powerful look at homelessness and survival. The books main character is Slake. Slake is a puny, skinny, and homeless boy. One day he finds newspapers, people leave on the floor, and a man comes and takes one and hands him some money. This is the start of a newspaper business. The author, Felice Holman, writes this book from two points if view. It is told from Slake's point of view and the train conductor's point of view. I would recomend this book to boy's and girl's ages 9-12. Will Slake and the train conductor ever meet? Will Slake ever survive to meet this man? Find out when you read ""SLAKE'S LIMBO""..."
4,Slake's Limbo is..,"I love books. I read this with my younger sister who is 12. Everytime I pulled out the book she groaned. I happened to like the the book. But, its no the greatest book for younger children. If you are over the age of maybe 14, 16. Then I think you might enjoy this. Sometimes I thought the book was a bit weird. Like the people Slake met didn't have names. I'm sure he knew there names just didn't say oh look its ""Sue"" the cleaning lady. Or ""Michelle"" The waitress. But-- Please read this book. :)"
3,This book is very realistic,"I read the book Slake Limbo. Slake is a young poor boy who lives in the subway. Though he goes to school, no one knows he lives in the subway or that he is very poor. Slake is very young, he is only 13 years old. This story takes place during the school year. His parents abandon him when he is a young baby."
3,Could Be Better,"I don't really like this book because the book is kind of confusing but I like the part when he has the idea of finding something that he could sell and use like one pair of gloves and some newspapers to sell so he could get some money with it instead of begging for money. Yes, other kids in our age should read this book because if they were homeless they should get some idea in the book to help them to live and also people that already are homeless should take some idea from it unless if they can buy one at the book store, too!!! And to help others everyday with the newspaper to sell."
3,This is a book for mature readers to read and discuss.,"I teach reading to 7th and 8th grade students who read below grade level, and I bought this book for them. The book is supposed to be for 9 - 12 year olds, but after reading it I think it can best be appreciated by older, more able readers. As one can tell from reading the Amazon customer comments, many readers in the 9 - 12 age group were confused by the book. The vocabulary is advanced, and the images are sometimes vague and dreamy. I enjoyed the book as an adult, but I think it is probably most appropriate for good readers who are capable of reading ""below the surface."" In addition, the story is set in the subway, and students who aren't familiar with subways, turnstiles, tokens, etc. will have a difficult time visualizing the setting."
3,How I see the symbols in Slake limbo,"Slake's Limbo is...intense, thought provoking, and teaches great lessons. If I may I will now tell you about the many great symbols in Slake's Limbo, and the example to go with them.One great symbol is, when Slake leaves the tunnel in which he once livedin is a symbol of Slake leaving his past life. Yet another great symbol is when Slakegets new glasses this is a symbol of Slake putting ona new personality, seeing the world in a better light.There are also some symbols of hardship. Such aswhen Slake is scared a symbolic bird appears in his heart. When the hole Slake lived in gets buried in cement a subway worker came and helped him to his feet, I think this is a symbol of Slake reaching out for help.This is a great book for kids going through tuff a time because this character goes through bad times but comes out on top, and you are shure to find these symbols in your self.How I see the symbols in Slake's Limbo"
3,andrew slakes limbo,"I think that Slake was a weird kid, because he lived in the subway for 121 days. I think that it would be for 6th graders because you can learn that you should not run away from your fears. It takes a long time to read. I would recommend this book to other kids because, it would teach them that being afraid is a natural feeling and that no matter how bad a situation, you always work them out."
3,If you like weird stuff read this!!!,"I think that Slake's Limbo is a good book. The only down side about it is that it has to many metaphors. Slake's Limbo is a weird book because there is very little that the book tells you about Slake. The only thing you know is that he is an orphan from the age of 13 and lives on his own in the subway Grand Central Station. He is a dreamer. He is aways dreaming and his dreams are freaky. He dreams about birds in his stomach, pigs being chased by nuns, leaves staying on trees al year long, a turban man spinning him in the chair, and other weird stuff. He really never had a friend except for a kid named Joesph. I gave this book three stars. It is Ok."
3,This Is An Ok Book!,"At one point in the book I did not like it, but at the end the book started to heat up and get much better. I learned stuff about Aremis Slake and other things about homeless people. The author ( Felice Holman) has very good imagination. When she starts something she really puts her mind to it. You can find out about what happens if you buy it. I would rate it a 3 because you didn't know what was going to happen next, it was unexpectible. I also gave it a 3 because i was not sure if I like it or didn't like it."
3,An interesting book about a homeless teenager.,"The novel Slake's Limbo by Felice Holman is a good one. It is about a 13-year-old boy and his experience as a homeless person. He is homeless because he ran away from a relative who was caring for him. The story covers everything from Slake finding shelter through him finding a source of income. It even involves Slake trying to find companionship. You could never guess what Slake gets for a companion. The ending might not be satisfactory for readers who like to know exactly what happens to the main character. I did not find that to be a problem. As I see it, the theme of this story is if you are a decent person, someone will care for you. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read about characters who live a hard life."
3,Slake's Limbo: The Underground World,"Aremis Slake was the worthless lump who was harassed, bullied and stepped on (sometimes literally). Until one day a fortuitous chance puts him in a semi-permanent home underground where he stayed 121 days. Felice Holman did a fantastic job in shaping Slake's realistic character and furnishing the book's attention grabbing plot. Slake's Limbo is packed with descriptive language that really make the story come alive for the reader. Slake's is am inspirational tale of a boy who's horribly disastrous life takes a surprising spin leaving him to figure out how to survive in his new surroundings. How will he attain food, water and find ways to live a completely different life: under the subway."
5,Not the best deal in the world for this excellent product,"I believe, if you search, you will find other internet retailers offering a better price than VS does.But, that said, this product is excellent. Lewis Labs Brewers Yeast is the most nutritious yeast I've found. (One of the more expensive KAL nutritional yeast products is very good too).I've actually come to enjoy the taste, and because it's grown directly on beets in a basement in formerly communist Eastern Europe (or some place like that) you know it's definitely not radioactive, which is nice to have in a yeast product."
1,Nasty taste,"This has the nastiest taste ever. I grew up on a large pig farm and the flavor reminds me of the pigs I used to feed. My husband has lost over 375 lbs once weighing almost 600 lbs. he started taking it based on health recommendations for diet. He gags and practically throws up while drinking or eating food it is mixed in. Maybe great for you, but horrible flavor."
2,Couldnt stand the taste,"I couldn't stand the taste, I had brewers yeast before (cant remember the name) I liked it. I gave this away. Wouldn't buy again."
1,wrong clips for KV heavy duty standards & brackets,"No fault of the vendor, Wood Workers Hardware, but some monkey at Amazon had these linked to the KV heavy duty standards which they are not intended for (and will not work with any of the KV heavy duty standards or shelf brackets)."
4,"Great nailer, garbage compressor","The brad nailer is outstanding. The compressor . . . not so much. The batteries quit holding a charge after three months or so. I have had the set for about two years. The nail gun is used almost daily. The compressor sits on the shelf collecting sawdust. I treat my tools like they are sledge hammers, this one has held up for the long haul. It has no leaks, misfires, or damage. I truely love the nailer. I wish I could send the compressor back and get my money back."
3,Not so good in terms of smoothness,"I likes pens and am willing to spend much money and time for a nice pen. Thinking that $20 was still worthy if it's really a nice pen, I ordered this gift for myself.However, when I got this Waterman Hemisphere pen in black, I was very disappointed. Yes, this pen does look nice and feels nice when holding it (it's rather heavy). However, in terms of smoothness, the most important characteristic of a pen, it's NO better (if not worse) than those cheap $1/dozen Bic or Papermate ballpoint stick pens! In this price, I had expected it to perform much better. This reminds me of a review at Bic Roundstick pens, ""Are they still better than those expensive pens?""Therefore, if you want to get a nice looking gift, then this one is not a bad choice; but if you want to get a nice writing pen for yourself, this one definitely is not worthy it."
4,A little light on the math for an econ/ engineer book...,"Great book, but aside from an explanation of their simulation model, I don't recall seeing a single equation (including actual numerical values) used to justify their claims."
1,"Lies, lies and more lies","Here in Brazil, I tried to read this trash-book on an internet site. And this trash-book has the same useless ideas of Margaret Sanger(in 1910 decade), Paul R. Ehrlich or the Club of Rome sometimes with new words, for the same frauds and prejudices.This book has the same answers to the main menaces to mankind: Babies from poor colored/poor woman again!This book again, tells about an inexistent future.There's nothing about Iran's atomic aiatollahs or Bin Laden, in this book.Such as in the books writen by Margaret Sanger, in 1910 and 1920 decades, the most terrible menace to us are, again babies from poor colored/poor woman.After reading some pages, I decided not to continuous to read, this trash-book."
1,What gives?,"So, these guys write this book in 1972 telling us how the sky is falling and it's all going to end in probably 20 years because we're all a bunch of greedy capitalist pigs.So, they're wrong about their predictions and they come back about 30 years later to try to scare people again?Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."
1,Just OK!,I recently bought this 3 cd set but was dissapointed to find out after opening it that every track is copied from a radio or TV show with quality in the low to bad end of the spectrum.
3,sings for lovers only,"The songs are wonderful,but the quality of the recordings can begin to get on your nerves. Their is no information in the booklet. All in all the CDs are fair."
3,Good,"NO-Xplode works for a lot of people, and it worked for me on the first cycle. I took time off like it says and the second cycle doesn't feel the same. I think my body adapted to it, so watch out for that."
1,As effective as drinking water,"Took it as instructed, ZERO effect, not a thing; except giving me a puffy face."
2,"remember, you get what you pay for",for the money this is an ok bow but it is missing a few things. the string is missing a nok set so the arrow tends to slide up the string when drawing the arrow back which I think is kind of dangerous. it is also missing a side kick cable guard which keeps the arrow from striking the other strings when released. if I had to do it over again I would have bought a nice recurve instead
5,this book is wonderful i really like it,this book gave me a lot of information and context clues and i made my self a 208 word essay for school this book is great
4,A very accurate description and explanation of fatherhood,"The author understands the difficulties of being a new father and explains what is happening with the baby, the mother, and the father for each month in the new year. It really helps dispel some fears and helps a new father know that he isn't the only man feeling strange about having a new baby in the house."
4,Hubby liked it!,"My husband refers to this book regularly. It's a must for new Dads. It is written so that it doesn't take a long time to read, which is important for busy parents. You can read each developmental section as your baby gets there. Very useful."
1,not for everyone,"I bought this book for my husband and I had to get rid of it. I ended up getting him ""Be Prepared"" which was much more practical and forgiving. The New Father author has very strong opinions and if this is your first baby and your husband is like mine and believes what he reads from an ""expert"" then this is not the book for you. For example, the author does not think you should use baby wipes for the first few weeks. Some babies have reactions to them, most don't, but the author doesn't say test them...he says don't use them period. My husband was turning into a backseat driver based completely on one person's word. My advice is to find a book that is written in a more suggestive than factual manner."
1,"Terrible, once again","Armin Brott has got to stop before he gives all fathers a bad name. His books continue to show up under the Christmas tree and there is a collective ""ugh!"" from my wife and I when we see the only thing his publisher got right with this guy, the silly covers that I assume lead to 99% of the purchases of this and his other books.This is just a terrible book, but a frighteningly poor author. You should look elsewhere."
4,Great source of information,The book has really good practical information. Even my wife (who has read several books about pregnancy and new born babies) finds useful and easy to follow information in this book. I'm really glad I bought it.
4,A must-have gift for the new daddy,"This will make an excellent gift for any new fathers. It is written by a father for fathers, and is one of the few books of the seemingly millions of parenting books meant especially for dad.It is broken into chapters corresponding with each month of a new baby's first year, and I have found myself going back to my well worn copy each month to re-read the chapter for a particular month. This is a good reference, but is unusually well written for a parenting book. Your dad friends (and the moms) will thank you for this nice gift when they get it, but more importantly, throughout the first year. I assure you they will use this book."
3,a different view,"A somewhat different view of fatherhood with some helpful information. The authors description of what to anticiapte at each month is helpful. However, some of his perspectives are completely unique and alarming to me. Especially disturbing was the asserion that it was normal to be sexually aroused by your child. I truly believe the author has a different perspective and lifestyle than the average father in this country and there are many books that would be more worthwhile and legitimate - by Dr. Brazelton or Penelope Leach. Spend your time and money on these other authors."
4,Great Help,I use this as reference tool more than anything it helps me know what my daughter needs and what to expect from her it is well written and covers a wide variety of topics.
1,sloppy,"Unfortunately, sloppy or nonexistent editingleft a number of typos and even simple conceptualerrors (e.g. confusing 1% with 100 % = 1).In a format like this which relies almost exclusivelyon solved problems the reader's confidence is undermined."
3,A Good Book For The Do-It-Yourselfer,A good book for someone who wants to learn the mathematics and mechanics of the various financial instruments.
1,Do Not Buy X-OOM MOVIE CLONE 3 GOLD,"Does not work as advertised. Customer support just says it is your PC's problem, or that the material is copy protected, which is was not. Major problems converting DVD's to PDA formats such a WMV. Copied DVD's do not work on most home DVD players."
3,Day Sleeper,"The beautiful noise of Day Sleeper has to be heard to be believed. Great bass line, great beats & on top of that: The guitar work is Awesome!Add another star for Someday (sounds timeless)& Wake Me. The songwriting has something going on here. Check out the Irish band Stand if you're into Longwave."
4,"Excellent, original sounds...","It's so nice to hear a band that isn't mining the same old range of influences (Velvet Underground, Clash, Stooges, etc.) as the Strokes, Libertines, Mooney Suzuki and the whole ""new rock revival"" crowd.Instead, Longwave has a really interesting mix of influences, ranging from 80s new wave to Slowdive and My Bloody Valentine-type shoegaze rock. Many of the songs feature some really interesting guitar noise and the singer has a lush, charismatic voice. It's also a refreshing change of pace to hear a singer who sounds optimistic and upbeat, instead of the same old angst ridden drugged out, Lou Reed wannabes infecting the airwaves today.I don't think Longwave sounds much like Interpol, but fans of that band would probably dig ""Strangest Things."" Even better, if you dig the Strafford 4 or are a fan of My Bloody Valentine looking for an alternative to ""Loveless,"" you could do a lot worse than ""Strangest Things."""
3,"Great '78 disc, bad '08 disc",The 1978 disc is a must have for any fan. Great camera work and sound. The 2008 disc could have been great however the video editing which flashes one second clips through the whole concert makes it unbearable to watch. Whoever thinks that this what people want have their head up their behind.
3,"Not the best sound, video, or performance quality","The sound quality of the '78 DVD is fair to bad. The late 70's recording is in a venue reminiscent of American Bandstand. The mix is poor and it lacks the feel of a real live concert, even though there is an audience. The sound and video quality is better on the 2008 DVD but the playing is uninspired and they seem like they are just going through the motions on much of it. Dicky's voice is also very weak. I think this is what 30+ years of smoking cigarettes and abusing drugs will do to you, if you are lucky. I give it three stars because it's a great resource for guitar players trying to learn these songs or this style but I do not recommend it for casual listeners. The studio versions are better in nearly all cases. There are good shots of Dicky's fingers for guitar players trying to copy his style."
5,2 great shows,"truely a great package 2 incredible live shows3 0 years apart, but jessica is definitely showin gno signs of age, but rather subtle hints of maturity, and with dickie having retired from touring this is your best opportunity to catch that beautiful tune performed by this guitar virtuosoany fan of the allman bro's of old will enjoy that characteristic dual leads and 2 drummer band makeup. the 78 show seems to have alivelier audienceand features thr tolar bro's dan and frankie who had actually been members of one of the latterday allman bro's lineups, and went on to tour with the greg allman bandyou'll probably recognize themthe 2008 show features dickie's son duanethe old father-son comboand because each showhas covers of jessica, in memory of elisabeth reed and rambling man, you can truly appreciate how even though dickie has been a great guitarist from alongtime ago, his talent has evolved to even greater heights. i'm sure i will be giving this package as a gift for years to come"
3,"Great Product, but doesn't quite fit motorcycle.","It works and is plenty loud, it just doesn't fit like it claimed it would so that is why it's 3 stars."
4,about time,"i must say i have been a fan of these games from the begining, i have played all of them, however 3,4 and tatics were all disappointing to me. i wanted it to get back to the second game which is my favorite, or so i thought. now i can say about time, this game is the best so far a must play for anyone who like the series"
4,Finally!,"I have been trying to listen to the whisper in my heart for about 5 years now without a lot of success. Finally a book comes along that tells me just how to do it. And it works! Thanks, Stephen for obeying the whisper in your heart and writing this book!"
5,S.M. at full blast,"This is a recording of Secret Machines when they performed at a radio station in LA; it's all live and all good. This was the first full album I had heard from them and I still think it is their best, although I have grown to respect and appreciate the studio albums as well (I bought all of them). To me, this band is the exact thing that a ""post-modern"" rock band should be. Whatever that means.If you are curious about Secret Machines... take the plunge and buy this. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
1,Unhappy Costumer,I never recieved this item in the mail therfor I am disapointed and would like a refund since I have already bought the book elsewhere when I didn't recieve it within the propper time. A month has gone by now since and the book never showed.
2,Made from a lot more than cotton,"This hat has an elastisized polyester headband on the inside. The adjustable ties are polyester. And, the brim, while it is cotton, sandwiches a foam core."
3,EXECUTIVE CHAIR,"I am dissatified,the chair that I ordered was a burgundy chair and they sent me a black chair."
1,Office Chair,The chair cannot be assembled and I've called and emailed the company with no reply. We are very dissatisfied.
4,THE UNDERTONES LIVE AND IN THE RAW,"This is a chance to hear and enjoy The Undertones live on the BBC sounding very raw and rockin'. The very early recordings sound a bit weak (no guitar solos!), but that's just the first few tracks. The band's skill then begans to take quantum leaps and by mid-first disc they are burnin' the house down! Their studio LPs are preferable for new fans. This album is for more hardcore Undertones fans, who will not want to be without it!!!"
5,I know,"I know the song VIVA FOREVER, and I like it. It's a saddening song, but it makes you think. I don't have the single, but I have the SPICE WORLD album, so I know what it sounds like... It sounds like, ""FIVE STARS!"""
4,Love him Live,"If you liked the We Shall Overcome album, you'll love this one. The added songs (American Land, When the Saints Go Marching In, How Can A Poor Man...) are fantastic additions. This is a great American band playing great American songs in...Dublin? A must have for any Springsteen fan."
4,A good time was had by all...,"If you wanted to hear the Seger Sessions live this is the place. Everybody sounds like they are having a good time and the audience is totally involved adding to the energy. While sometimes taking on an old time Gospel feel on songs that truly fit the bill, like ""Jacob's Ladder,"" and ""Eyes on the Prize,"" there's still the sing-along silliness of songs like ""Pay Me My Money Down"" and ""Old Dan Tucker"" to lighten the mood. A few misfires like the unfortunate takes on his own songs ""Atlantic City"" and ""Growin' Up"" which didn't respond well to the style of music found on this tour (Although I did like ""State Trooper"" and the ridiculous ""Blinded by the Light"" found here.) and by sucking the life out of ""When the Saints go Marching In"" he did the song no favor, but the overall effect of this concert is one of jubilation that is captured very well."
5,A Must-Have for Bruce Devotees,"I opted out of seeing Bruce during the Seeger sessions concert tour, but I watched the concert live from Dublin on television and halfway through the show went online to buy this CD. It's fantastic. It opens with a new version of ""Atlantic City"" that had me tapping my toes. Being from New Jersey and a huge fan of A.C. I love this song and it's a great opener. It's got a few oldies done in a new way (""Blinded by the Light"" in particular) but the new stuff is a real treasure find. Bruce is a musical genius and put together an awesome horn section for this tour. It takes a lot to get me tapping the steering wheel and bopping in the car; but this CD is like being at a Bruce concert. My 5 year old granddaugher has added ""get out the way Old Dan Tucker"" to her pre-school repertoire!"
3,don't confuse shouting with singing,"Of all the other reviews I've seen of this concert recording, H. Feifs is the only one who offers any perspective on Springsteen's recent phase. Bruce's voice just isn't suited to most of this material. He flattens out the melodies of the tradional songs by shouting them instead of singing them. And he sounds like he's losing his voice. He never had much range to begin with, but here he has even less than usual. I think the highlights of the concert are when the other singers are featured. The MUSICIANSHIP is good, but overall it sounds like a Pogues imitation. If you already own the ""Seeger Sessions,"" you just don't need this."
3,Springsteen Dublin CD,"Good album - little long on some of the songs - but overall, very enjoyable..."
1,Melancor,I tried the product for 6 months. It did not work. Their customer service department is very bad. They will not return call or e-mails as promised.
1,wasted money,"I used this product religiously for 8 months, as intructed, and it did absolutely nothing for gray hair. Would be interested in seeing some ""honest"" pictures and testimony from anyone for whom this did work. Sorry I wasted my money on their gimmick."
2,Too hard and the horrible smell,"I bought those nipples because I thought they will be less hard than those in silicone, but I was wrong, they were harder and moreover the smell of latex was very strong..."
5,work great,these are just what we needed to hold all of our paper zombie targets in place and for the price how can you pass 'em up
2,Basic vacuum cleaner - no luxury here!,"Even for a basic vacuum cleaner I would expect all tools to fit 'on board' and the electric lead to roll up mechanically, not to have to roll it up by hand and fit underneath. The main suction head may be ok for carpets but not very friendly for hardwood floors since it only has 2 very small & thin strips of that red velvety material, that don't stop the head from scraping the floor. The suction hole in the head is very small, what a waste of space - needless to say it doesn't suck very well! It would also have been very useful to have the extension parts fit into one extendable tube, instead of having 3 separate parts... Well, I guess I've been spoilt with my Miele the last 10 years... Unfortunately we moved from the UK to the USA and had to leave it behind..."
1,Faulty hookup,Never did try the machine since the attachment area for the hose was defective making it impossible to even test run the vacuum.
2,Avoid this,God what a desilusion. Having heard some other albums of dmx krew i decided to buy this.It was an error.Only two song are worthly.
2,Nowhere near Buckley's old suspense standards,"I have been reading Buckley's thrillers for years and even have an autographed copy of ""Brothers No More."" I much preferred the Blackford Oakes series to his latest efforts, and this book is certainly among the worst of the newer stuff. The novel is a plodding bore, and when it doesn't plod, it drags. The legal arguments are arcane and not deeply explored, and I suspect they are of interest only to history and law buffs. The author sets up a barely intriguing love triangle, then abruptly drops it with hardly an explanation. There is neither action nor suspense. I don't know why Buckley wasted his time here; don't waste your money."
2,unimpressive,Yes it will be nice to learn a few things about Nuremberg while following a live personal story. The problem is that this live personal story completely fails to click.
3,"Like a ""dumbed down"" version of a more complete version","Having read articles by Buckley in the past, but no fiction, I was disappointed by this book. It has all the ingredients of a first rate work, but was taken from the oven half done. None of the characters are really developed, and when the book finally gets through the superficial aspects of the main character's life and into the meat and potatoes of his involvement in the Nuremberg trials, the author dishes out enough to really interest the reader in the subject matter, both the non-fiction and fiction aspects of the plot, then stops far short of fully satisfying the reader's appetite for either.Every aspect of the book, even the vocabulary, reads as though the book is a 'simplified' version rewritten for younger readers, or a Reader's Digest condensed version of the original. All in all, a wholly unsatisfying treatment of the subject matter."
2,Come Back BLackford Oakes!,"A fan of Buckley's novels with Blackford Oakes as the CIA agent involved in international crises, I looked forward to this historical novel. I was sorely disappointed.Buckley's main character is flat. The conflict he will face is apparent and obvious early. The ""big twist"" at the end was predictable and meager.Worse, I was never sure if Buckley knew what he wanted to write. A novel about a participant in the trials? A novel with a philosophical debate? An expose on the legal tenets used in the Nuremburg trials? Unfortunately, all of these were touched upon in the book, but none satisfactorily probed or developed in depth. Instead, the book was scattered and disorganized with the reader left to want more in each area.Overall a very disappointing book about a topic that has so much to offer."
5,Stays together just fine!,"I didn't buy this toy for my child because of the review that said it didn't stay together. But, he received it as a gift recently and it snapped together and stays together just fine. He loves playing with it. I wonder if the negative reviews came from people who bought an older model and the toy has since been improved??"
4,Creativity is REQUIRED,"I capitalized ""required"" because the alternative arrangements cannot be made with the pieces in the kit. Of course, the alternatives are just pictures, no instructions; so I got close, but not exact. Regardless, my son loves the set and I have a bit of fun putting it together. And, as other reviewers have written, he has tons of fun demolishing it! Does anyone know if there are add-on pieces for Phantom Island?"
3,"Solid information, but not an enthralling read","What A Producer Does is, well, a bit dry. It's packed with good information, enlightening the reader on the dozens of issues involved in making a film that most of us never even think about. For that, it's worth reading - but not for the writing itself, which is very dry and not all that engaging.The information was sometimes enlightening and eye-opening, and the reading brisk and easy, but it completely lacked depth and did little to touch on the ART of the producer. The book's message can be summed up as follows: ""Hire a bunch of good people and stay out of the way. Oh, and make sure they stay under budget.""Not a bad book by any measure, but it's very textbook-like in nature. If that's what you want, a big thumbs up. Otherwise, grab this only if you spot a good deal."
1,"no, no, no","These eye pads are super saturated. I thought it would add something extra (as far as pampering) to 'face-mask night'. The watery stuff gets in your eyes. So, I rang it out, figuring less product might get better results. After a few minutes the skin around my eyes became very irritated. Itchy, burny, dry, yuck. You want something to cover your eyes with? Slice up a cool cucumber."
3,It doesn't fit my 1997 Toyota Camry LE,"It said that it would fit my Camry, but it does not fit! It's a little too short and one of the ""circles"" is smaller in circumference. It is built well, and looks like it would work great....if it only fit my car."
3,Anchor 8200 Strut Front Right Mount ( Toyota Camry ),Fits right like an original part of the camry and also looks like the original one that i just replaced.Way cheaper than the auto parts store.
5,"High Quality, Very Cute, Perfect for Toddler","This baby doll is absolutely adorable. She is crafted of high quality and very soft for my toddler's arms. She's a Santa Gift, and I'm quite sure my daughter will love her!"
5,Miss Doria doll,This doll is very attractive. it is soft and i think my granddaughter will enjoy her.
1,"pay more, get a better pointer",This is indeed a piece of junk. The batteries don't fit tight in the case and you have to shake it to get it to work. It is not reliable. I teach college courses and constantly had to stop my class to fiddle with this thing. I threw it away. I am going to spend a little more and get a better one. You should too.
2,not reliable - very average,"I have owned at least three of these over the years because our office supply source only has this type. They all work ok but they do not last long. As other have said, the battery cover and case are cheap plastic."
3,"Loaded with information, but just a little disappointing","I recently took my first ""adult"" trip to Las Vegas a few weeks ago and this was one of the books I purchased for my trip. It's loaded with information, but I felt that Mr. Reza concentrated more on scope, than giving us any real depth or accuracy to his entries. Often, I found myself at odds with some of his recommendations and his writing style just reeked of strained, quasi-urbane hipness and attitude. I don't want to be too critical of the book, I certainly have to admire Mr. Reza's ambition for covering so much ground in his travel guide, but I felt that whatever he suggested wasn't also recommended in some of the other cheaper, better travel guides that I had with me on my trip."
2,Not impressive,"I think the only review posted here was a little generous. This book is way to overpriced for the ""places"" they suggest. Really, there's nothing in the book that you can't find elswhere on the web. Another problem, and this really turned me off, is the fact that this writer has such a GUSHY STYLE! I almost felt he went to the various vendors to have THEM write the entries for their stores or cafes. Sure the author covers a lot of ground, but I go for quality, not quantity."
3,"Ignore other reviews, and take a listen","Ignore both the other reviews (including the one that is repeated) as they are an insult to both Carter and Alpert. (Besides, only a moron would compare the music to either a laugh hour show or an Alpert arrangement, ditto someone who thought this playing was sloppy or fumbling).Carter is superb on the piccolo bass, and the arrangements are what he wanted. At its best, this record is a wonderful exposition of a brilliant musician at his finest. At its worse (which isn't bad) it sounds overproduced.If you don't like the arrangements, then check out Carter's Piccolo. Or shut up."
1,Ron....why?,"I love jazz. I hate this album. My heart filled with joy when I bought this album online. Now my heart is filled with sadness. A message to all young bass players: if Ron Carter can produce and sell an album like this, there is hope that maybe someone will record OUR sloppy fumblings and we can be on the cd racks in major stores."
4,Track deficiency,Though we enjoy our GeoTrax system very much. My only complaint is that the track set doesn't have a center rail for the engine to catch. This is present in the Grand Central Station pieces but not in these extensions. Sometimes the train needs an additional push when it doesn't have the center rail to latch onto.
4,The story of a gruesome triple murder,"A true crime book that doesn't forget the victims of this bloody murder and ensures we don't forget them either. I neither agree or disagree about the statements on Jeffrey McDonald's guilt, knowing very little about Fatal Vision, but there are disturbing parallels: allegations of sloppy police work, sneaky prosecutors and a railroad of a trial. What struck me most is that the evidence used against Tim Hennis could just as easily have been used to prosecute John Raupach or Julie Czerniak's boyfriend, and probably would have had the police found either of them first. That such evidence was enough to send one man to Death Row is really scarey, and he was very lucky to get out. I feel the book could have used more photographs, particularly of crime scenes, but the photos of the Eastburn children bring tears to your eyes."
3,"Good Book...Case Reopened,","The book was good, however new DNA tests done over the summer of 2006 connect Hennis to the murders.The Army has charged Hennis and he is awaiting an Article 32 Hearing in April 2007 to see if the case can proceed to trial.An Article 32 hearing is the military version of a civilian Preliminary Hearing, in which a judge or panel will decide if there is enough evidence to go to trial.We shall see how this all unfolds soon.PS. THe military can charge and try someone who was aquitted in a civilian/state court, and it is not considered double jeopardy."
1,Whisnant is a fraud,"The books author is a fraud. He made a career out of supporting this guy- a book and a dopey made for TV movie. Whisnant postured and preached and hung his career coat on the of this guy. He basically made a career of supporting a violent killer (and not the two kids with the cut throats. The problem? 23 years after the fact and they were actually able to test for DNA, and guess what? HE DID IT. His DNA (sperm) was found inside the victim. Pretty hard to dispute that. But this book author is so arrogant, and let's be honest his life was tied into this that he now implies the science was wrong. Not kidding- bad science. Because he couldn't of been wrong all these years- nope the actual science was wrong. Or the police somehow planted the killers DNA inside this women. What a joke this guys is. He should be ashamed. The book itself is a bad piece of fiction."
5,The Handbook of the Broken Hearted,"When Oliverio realizes Ana is the love of his life, he literally levitates to where she's waiting for him. The same way you feel after you watch this movie, you want to levitate.. you want to experiment again the feeling of falling in love. This is the story of a bohemian man who has lost his willing to keep going and is already flirting with suicide when he meets the girl of his dreams: a prostitue convinced she's not worthy of real love and is terrified of her feelings to Oliverio. This is visual poetry, where metaphores become real. Amazing how using such strong language or explicit images, it's still possible to create beautiful poetry. An absolute must see for all those who ever lost faith in love.. as a poet said, it's the 'handbook of the broken hearted'. I guarantee you'll really discover what's on the dark side of your heart."
5,One of the best of Argentine Cinema.,"If you see two foreign films this year, these should be those two:""El Lado Oscuro del Corazon"" and ""Valentin""."
5,El Lado oscuro del Corazon,"Awesome movie...pretty strange, surreal...it shows what love really means, romaticism and other ""philosophic"" way to see it...Very recommendable !!!"
4,"Excellent movie, poor dvd quality","This is an excellent movie. One of the best movies I have ever watched. I think that's quite enough to recomend it to you. If not I can add that the story is marvellous, that makes you think and feel at the same time. The characters are complex and different to what probably you have seen in the movies before, but are much more close to what you are that the Hollywood films. And above all, the film as a whole makes you dream with its poetical and lyrical way of talking about real and everyday life.The one and only but, the quality of the dvd is poor, very poor."
3,"Makes good vacuum, handle a bit cheap",The one I received was in fact a Mityvac. Good sign.It works well (-85 psi) but the plastic handle pivot is rubbing too hard and you can see plastic dust.I've added some teflon grease and it seems to cope better.The tubes has angles due to packaging. They should be a bit stronger but it works.Included items seem good quality. Not tried on long term.
4,plastic housing!,"This product is good, the only thing is I am concerned about the housing being made of plastic. How long will it last? The OEM I bought 20 years ago broke and had to replace it. I just hope I get the same amount of years out of this one. I have used it 10 times so far to diagnose leaking solenoids in the evap system. Has worked great so far! Can't beat it for the price!"
1,JUNK JUNK JUNK!!!!!!!,"This thng is worthless, I read mixed reviews, I have no idea why there are any good ones. Absolutely did not work in any sense of the word."
2,hand vac pump,"This item was delivered on time the description was very accurate it is for brake jobs and is not effective for vac purging wich alot of people are buying it for but I must say I was happy with the product thanks amazon, but if anybody want this for vac purging I dont recommend it get the fjc vac pump"
2,Be careful!,"First off I have bled brakes a many a time with an assortment of bleeders...not that I need to prove anything to Amazon shoppers. This product worked well at first, but as soon as brake fluid got around the fittings it would constantly fail (fall apart). Yes, I know I could have zip tied them or used hose clamps. On the product I recieved, the tubing was kinked very badly for it to fit in the package; which may also caused pinholes in the tubing. I bled four calipers with it and on the fourth, fluid got into the vac somehow and squirted in my face from the vac gauge fitting. Which could be my fault for not thourghly check the fitting. Attempted to clean it out, but it was ruined. Yes, I did read the directions. Next time I will just go all out and buy a quality vac system.If your really careful and this while bleeding brakes this product may last a little longer."
2,Doesn't quite work as designed.,The pump leaks air when pumped and sprays stray oil around the hinges.Can never get the nipples to fit and stay.It does some pumping but far from satisfactory.I've worked on my cars for 23 years and like to believe that I know what I'm doing...Maybe it's just me... I don't know.But this kit just didn't work for me.
5,Yah I own this thing,"Are you looking for a drill for someone? Thinking 10 volt, 12 volt, 14 volt, etc? Well whatever you buy, make sure it's a DEWALT. These things rock. I have this 12 volt thing and it's my everyday drill: wood, metal, whatever. Sure a 10 volt cheapo drill would do the job, but DEWALT drills just function SO WELL plus they make that excellent full-stop noise when you release the trigger. It's like a drill from the future! Plus it's a cool yellow/black color, which is the greatest color combination for all manly electrical products. PS: use drill bits."
1,My son still has not received the Dewalt drill. Please look into it!,I have no review to give until my son receives his birthday gift that is now a month late! I'll be contacting my visa to have the charge reversed if not received within the next few days.
3,Right Drill...Wrong Price,"Amazon's alleged super savings price is only pennies below the price of your local hardware retailer. It's alleged list price of $150 is seldom actually paid for the 12v version of this product. I've used Dewalt now for over a decade and it is my favorite cordless drill (Makita is definitely more durable but far less pleasant to use on the site). I just purchased this very drill kit for $102 with shipping. Do some shopping, you'll beat this Amazon price with little effort."
3,Another Fugitive Falsely Accused,"One of the most commonly used themes that the script writers of THE FUGITIVE liked was the one of a man, other than Richard Kimble, being falsely accused of a crime. During the course of a four year run, this sort of thing routinely happened. In TERROR AT HIGHPOINT, Jamie, a strong but mentally disabled young man, is hired by Buck (well played by Jack Klugman). The other field workers taunt him mercilessly, causing Kimble to take pity on him and offer whatever solace he could. In many episodes Kimble shows his essential goodness of nature by helping those humans and animals who are in need of that help. Buck's wife is attacked but cannot identify the attacker. Naturally, the confused Jamie is blamed, who runs away in fear. Later, Kimble learns that the predator is one of the posse members.This is one of the very ordinary episodes, whose only saving grace is to further bring out Kimble's willingness to help others even at the risk of his own detection."
1,Lee Oskar Reed Plates Key of G,One of the reeds was bent on the lower plate and could not be fixed with the reed maintenance tools I had.So I improvised using an old lower reed plate for the draw notes and the new upper reed plate for the blow notes
2,disappointed,I like the colour and size of these French Onion soup bowls but I was quite disgruntled to learn [after purchasing] that they were made in Thailand.
5,excellent book,This is an excellent book about the lives of the women in the Bible. It goes into detail about Jewish history. It gives insight into why women had the rolls they did and why they were so important in Jesus Christ Life. It is the best book I have read reguarding the historical events of women at that time.
3,Arrived defective,The first piece arrived defective; it did not have the screw holder in the base to hold the smaller handle. I had to go through the hassle of returning it and ordering a new one. The second piece arrived intact.
1,Must Unscrew Top to Put Paper Towels On,"This is a nice solid wood, but it only gets one star from me because you have to unscrew the top piece every single time you want to put a roll of paper towels on. That's such an annoying way to do it and most paper towel holders aren't built that way any more because it's tedious."
4,Encyclopedic and very useful,I find this book with its encyclopedic bend extremely useful on those more difficult or rare cases. This is NOT a replacement for Foucar/Farhi/WHO type books or an atlas. There are very few useful images.....what you get is a much more in depth review of IHC/flow data that can't be found in any other book. There are also great tables.
1,I hope they don't make a 3rd edition,This book is very long and not very interesting to readThere does not seem to be any plot at all and there are too few pictures and they are not in color.
1,Totally Disatisfied!,"I bought a similar model (Eureka 6983A/D) on Amazon and am totally disatisfied with it. The machine came without a model number sticker on it, which I didn't notice until I tried to get service covered under warranty. The vacuum broke brush roll belts from the second time I used it. The repairman told me I would have to clean the brush roll every time I use it to avoid having it melt solid again because the brush roll does not have a shield to protect it from dog hair and other materials one normally vacuums up. Eureka refused to replace the brush roll ($25.95) because I couldn't supply the model number sticker that they didn't put on my particular machine. I will never buy another Eureka vacuum!"
5,Great Service,The seller was fast and accurate. No worries when buying from this store. They are exactly as advertized and exactly what I needed for a restoration product. You will not find these at hardware and big box stores.
4,Almost perfect,"These have some defects. But the metal is perfect 1/10 might not work, but that's like that with screws and supplies. It's called the effect of standard deviation."
4,A Great Day on My Favourite Planet,"Billed as Brian's first song-based album since ""Before and After Science,"" probably no release has been more keenly anticipated in recent years. When you're in the mood for Brian's wordplay, really nothing else scratches the itch.Which also explains why this disc gets only 4 stars. The lyrics here are not up to the standards of his golden quartet of song-albums -- and neither are the songs. They're all built on various studio treatments of one sort or another, many to the voice itself, as if Brian has lost confidence in his silky baritone. Pity.The treatments are intriguing, as one would expect, and as a result the disc sounds fairly novel. But the songs tend toward 'steady-state' start-and-run, without much in the way of rhythmic variation or odd time signatures and are not as immediately listener-friendly as his best work.Still, my disappointment is only worth a star or half-star off a maximum rating, as any new Eno vocal album is an event to be celebrated!"
1,what this album needs,ENo needs a vocal track with Jennifer Lopez. At least one track with JLo would help this album get into the dance charts.
5,Magnificient,"This record is absolutely brilliant. Of course, you can't expect less from Eno. The songs are tremendously beautiful. They are very accesible and you'll probably like them the first time you listen to them, but make no mistake--- the fact that they are accesible doesn't mean that they are conventional. The songs are built amongst the most unusual backing tracks, sounds and songs structures--- vintage Eno. When a song like ""Bone Bomb"", which is not even sung but spoken by a cold female voice, is so moving that it can make you cry, then you know you're listening to the work of a genius."
4,Stick with it,"If you are stuck in the past or only want to give this album a quick listen before passing judgment, then it's not for you. But if you are open to new things and give this album some time I think you'll find a jewel.I was skeptical on my first listening but as I listened more I found much beauty and depth that wasn't at first apparent. The old Eno is here; the poet of the obscure, the thinking musician, but with a new palette. Perhaps at first a jarring one to those of us raised on the 70s Eno. But if you open yourself up to it, you can find the same rewards as in the 70s masterpieces.There are plenty of musicians who are happy to be pale imitations of their former glory. Luckily, Eno isn't one of them."
3,Parts of this are excellent,"I came to Eno back in the late 1970's as an impressionable youth and this is the state I return to while hearing his voice again after so many years.The first track, ""This"", is gorgeous. ""And Then So Clear"" evokes an AI lamenting the loss of its own cold, innocent hubris, celebrating the acquisition of reget, forgiveness and love. Or something. Much of Eno's charm is what he evokes in us, no matter what it has to do with the lyrics.I love hearing Eno's voice. I love it so much that now I am going to go figure out how I can afford to get his 1970's post-Roxy Music, pre-ambient albums again. I last owned them all on vinyl twenty years ago.This album isn't a good place for newcomers to start. Try the 1970's stuff. Get used to Eno's voice, then come back to this and feel the aging Eno drifting through his peaceful laments."
2,"In b&w, static picture, sound could be better","This documentary, in black and white, shows the artists playing, but the scenes are relatively static, the quality of sound could be better, and the picture in not much richer than a slightly animated slide show, unless the objective is to see the artist's technique. Watching this documentary has not much advantage over listening just the music from CD and looking at a photo for non-experts."
4,History Buffs and Take Note,"This will be a pleasantly surprising book for those unfamiliar with the long and, dare I say, glorious history of the oldest daily newspaper in the USA.Founded by Alexander Hamilton, the NYP went on to help shape New York City and even the nation, in substantial, surprising ways (the creation of Central Park, the candidacy of Lincoln, the founding of the NAACP, etc.). Page Six fans will be pleased too -- there are ample servings of dirt, scandal and snort-inducing headlines. In short: an informative, fun read.One small complaint: I would have liked to see 200 years worth of editorial/political cartoons included in the book."
4,Good beginner / intro level book,I am a seasoned WebLogic developer and this book allowed me to get up to speed with Beehive quickly. I was able to get the examples to work - but just had to make sure I use the version of Beehive that this book was written against.
1,This is a beginners guide not a pro guide,"The book basically instructs you on how to install eclipse, pollinate and xmlbeans. Has very shallow coverage of the beehive related technology - java page flows, netui, controls and xmlbeans plus a shallow coverage of annotations. I am frankly surprised as usually Apress books are very good. They should change the name to Beginning Apache Beehive. There is nothing done in this book that can't quickly be gleaned from the beehive.apache.org site. These guys should truly be ashamed of themselves. Where is the code intensity that was promised. I'm glad I got it for 1/2 cover price. Please go look at this book before purchasing you can't always depend on the publisher."
5,"Simple, hands-on book","This is a good book - the chapters are well written, easy to read and have some good content. Overall the examples were easy to follow and very direct.Thisis a must have if you are using Apache Beehive or planning on it."
5,Department 56 Dickens Village Ebenezer Scrooge's House,"Well packaged, arrived in great condition, and when it was expected. Gave my wife this for Christmas and she is very happy with this product."
3,moyen moyen,les détails ne sont pas très bien travaillés - scène animée dans la maison mais on voit au travers des fentres les fils et la mécanique..dommage!* Details are not very good - scene livened up in the house but we see through windows the threads and the mechanics !
5,A very nice addition to Dickens Village,A very nice piece. This was a gift for my son for Christmas. He requested this to add to his collection. He especially liked the animation of the three ghosts spinning around Scrooge in his upstairs bedroom.
3,"Nice, but flawed","It's a beautiful piece to our collection; however, we noticed that one of the ghosts is missing. The second floor has a revolving turntable with Scrooge and ghosts: we have 2 ghosts (not 3) and a bare post where the third ghost should be. We thought it might have gotten dislodged and fallen to the bottom. Then we discovered that the bottom is cemented shut and not only could we not get at a possible loose ghost, but we would not be able to change a burned-out light bulb in the future. Poor design of this model. We are attempting to contact the company for an exchange, since Amazon is out of stock."
3,Dickens Village Ebenezer Scrooge's House,"This is a beautifully rendered building in the classic Dickens village style. I have only one complaint about this item. Because it attempts to portray the visitation of the three ghosts of Christmas Past, Christmas Future, Christmas Present, it does so in a large room on the second floor. The problem is the use of bright white light to provide a sense of the supernatural to the home. This bright white light was offensive to my eyes. With the rest of the entire village lit in a rather subdued amber sort of lighting more in keeping with the lighting of the period, the bright white light simply overwhelmed the entire display with its garishness. While I liked the building itself, I sent the item back because it just didn't look right when displayed with all the other Dickens Village structures."
5,Dickens house,"Very detailed, and the people dancing in the upstairs window was a nice surprise! I also like the slim design since I have many houses and need to fit them all on display!"
4,Get it,"I bought this item before my daughter was born and chose it based on other reviews. For the first two monthes, it was good for a 15 min hands free break while cooking, paying bills etc. She didn't much care about the lights, sounds, or hanging animals. Now, at three monthes old, the seat is quickly becoming worth every penny. She loves practicing her new skills by hitting the hanging animals repeatedly and kicking away at the foot area to make the voice and lights happen. They both really grab her attention and she will play like that for a good 20-30 minutes at a time. The continuous music mode is also good when she is in more of a mellow mood.Overall, a good investment that I would reccommend to others."
1,UNSAFE - Do not leave your alone in this thing,"Although I like LeapFrog products, I have some serious concerns about the safety of the LeapFrog Magic Moments Learning Seat.My son is 6 months old and is not any more or less mobile than other children his age. The poor design of the Learning Seat combines the unfortunate mix that allows the child to lean forward (while properly strapped in), and a resulting forward centre of gravity that allows the chair to tip all the way forward.We have another similar chair made by another company, and our son can't even get close to tipping over in that one although he tries to do the same leaning forward motion. The straps are more secure, at better angles, and the forward supports are far enough forward that it will never be able to tip straight over the way this product does.We were lucky. We happened to be in the room when he did his forward tipover for the first (and last) time, and I caught him about a nano-second before a face-plant.thx,"
4,Wonderful for Even a Newborn,"Most of the reviews I've read talk about older babies, but I received this seat as a present when our son was 2 weeks old. He likes (but not loves) his seat and his neck doesn't hang over at an odd angle. I say not ""loves"" because he still isn't old enough to really focus and play. But for now the vibrations and music calms and entertains him. Discovered that the vibration does automatically shut off (somewhere between 15- 20 minutes?) because he started to fuss when it did. Also, the music selection shuts off after a few minutes. I realize its meant to be interactive, but I think one setting should stay on longer to entertain younger babies who can't make the connection just yet. Although I still adore this seat!"
2,Not a fan,"Another reviewer aptly pointed out this isn't really a bouncer because it doesn't bounce that well. Very true. I also don't like how the foot pad that makes noise doesn't work unless you have the arch thing pushed in, but I don't like that thing because I can't see my child with all the plastic stuff hanging down in front of her face. So without the arch thing in place, the thing doesn't bounce that well AND the foot pad doesn't make any noise. Rather big and cumbersome, too."
2,Very Good Effort,"Easy, descriptive read. Very good effort compared to several others I recently read. However these books from this company seem to be below an acceptable standard when it comes to professionalizm and editing and this very good effort needs a little more of both before I could rate it above a two star effort. Get someone other than those furnished by the pulisher to put a little polish on the editing and this could be a 4 star book easily. Do try again and if you obtain better editing, I'll even buy your next effort."
1,Costly for selfpublishing,"Although the story line was fair, the cost of this self publishing wasn't. When a writer attempts to break into the writing world of Lesbian fiction, they should select to do their very best a presenting a book that would please the readers for the cost involved. This wasn't worth the money spend, nor will I purchase anything else by this author or this desk top flub of a publisher."
1,"Definitely needs work, especially with editing","Being all aroused by the previous reviews I bought this book. That was before someone finally placed a true review for this first attempt by Mar. She needs work with her story line, with the development of the characters and certainly the editing needs a lot of work. Have to give her some credit, this was a nice attempt for a first works, but it falls short for the amount of money it cost."
5,Fantastic,"This is a real adventure, I couldn't put it down. The adventure begins on page one and leads you on a wild trip through the home of the Golden Gate. I love a good rush, this isn't just a few sex scenes with junk to hold it together, this is a real story with a fantastic plot. I can't say enough."
3,Better than most!,"This book was better than most of the self-published fiction out there, and I liked the setting a lot. It's not a matter of getting what you pay for, though, because it's more expensive than the books from publishers who do editing (Bella Books, Naiad, Alyson, Spinsters Ink, Rising Tide and so on). In the case of this book, though, the author was good enough and careful enough that it was worth not just the money, but the investment of time to read it. I haven't been able to say that about some of the self-published books I've read lately!"
4,Essex Green 2nd album,"The 2nd full-length CD from Brooklyn's Essex Green is very good, although their debut Everything Is Green was a little better. I was happy with the packaging and condition of the CD as well."
2,Too little information for the dollar.,"I bought this with the hopes that it would reveal some ""secrets"" about host anemones. It did not. The book basically gave some basic anatomy of host anemones, described the natural environment of them, and talked about diet. Dr. Shimek took the aproach that lighting intensity is of little importance, and if I had not been well informed I might have attempted to keep a bubble tip amemone under Normal Output florescent. Twenty five pages for the price is simply not worth it. This was more like an academic paper than anything."
1,Ridiculous Disinformation and Propaganda Dept.,"OK, kids. We all agree, drugs are bad. But, this issue of Teen Titans was coerced by Ronny Raygun's ""Lying is OK, as long as it gets results!"" campaign. And, he certainly didn't hold back when it came to lying to children.On the very first page, the very first panel, has a fictitous child spewing inanities such as ""I've taken achohol..."" and ""Another friend was doing smoke...""I hope the world has learned, that if you are going to keep kids off drugs, you need to tell them the truth. Because, once they spot even one lie, they never trust you, again."
5,Truth Being Told,"A delightful movie for a number of reasons. The characters are real and from the ""get-go"" I cared about what happened to Rose. Bryan, Darrow and Mencken are extremely well played. The falsehoods and false impressions of the trial we all were subjected to in ""Inherit The Wind"" are corrected. The story line moved quickly with twists and turns, making my afternoon viewing very enjoyable.As a retired home school mom, I strongly recommend that parents show both movies to their teens, (most likely your child will view Inherit the Wind in school) do some research from primary sources on the trial, and discuss with your kids how movies shape the thinking of the culture for better or for worse."
1,DISAPPOINTED,The same junk from a really smart guy.No real NEW ideas on how to invest.just another book to make money .
4,Slow shipping?,"It took the book about three weeks to come, but that could have been media mail, which is outrageously slow."
4,This Book Made Me Rich,"The author wrote before his bestselling books ""Investments For Hairy Bikers"" and ""Adventure Capitalist - Use It Or Lose It"".The author is one of the many hundreds of thousands of the world's most successful investors. Along with Bill Gates they have invested considerable funds into Funds.All in all I rate this book as Five Stars. HurraySigned,Erica Phillips(Retired since I got rich rich rich, thanks to the author)"
2,Good overview. Short on specifics.,"A good overview of commodities but of limited help as to specifics. You will not learn the ""how to"" of commodities."
4,"Rogers, Again a Good Book","Jim Rogers again delivers a good educational read. This book shows how we are entering a long term bull market in commodities and a long term bear market in equities. This is a belief not widely held by Wall Street- which has a vested interest in teaching you to ONLY be involved with equities and to do so ONLY on the long side, both of which are wrong at all times, but that discrepancy will be amplified in the coming decade.Take Rogers’ specific trading suggestions with a big grain of salt, but conceptually he hits the nail right on the head.Professor John W. Kercheval, IIIGeorgetownWashington, DC"
2,Very little info on trading,"After reading Jim Rogers book I understood one thing: he has no intention to teach you anything but his fun retirement life stories.If you like to learn more about trading read Toby Crabel or Linda Rascke, visit Jeff Cooper but don't let millionairs fool you into thinking that they will teach you something you can make money with."
3,buy and hold,Dont expect any trading tips. Jim R. is all about buying value and sitting. He gives his reasons for a major bull move in commodities. Some markets have moved pretty well. He says the trend will continue give or take..
1,Caveat Emptor,"Before anyone else reads this book and decides that the case is strong enough to seek out how to invest in a commodities index fund, do a search on Google for ""investors sue Jim Rogers."" Investors in Rogers' fund (and I am one as well) may have lost an enormous amount of money due to the Refco debacle and Rogers' dealings with the Refco sleazebags. The CEO of Refco is now wearing an ankle bracelet and I don't mean the one for tennis. Just remember that this is the firm Rogers was thinking about selling his index fund to before you continue to laud his genius."
3,Rating Jim Rogers,"As a result of Jim Rogers, I've actually changed a substantial part of my portfolio. However, this is an endorsement of Jim Rogers, and not the book, ""Hot Commodities."" I knew no more after reading the book than I did after hearing and seeing him on TV. The message could have been summed up in about ten pages, not 255."
5,Excellent advice for the beginner,"A study of the history of supply and demand of the commodities is essential reading for nayone wanting to trade. But don't forget the basics that apply to ALL trading, namely CUT YOUR LOSSES! Obviously commodities is more about supply and demand than stocks and bonds, so when the spot price is higher than the futures price, current demand is greater than supply and price will rise. Great book which should be part of every traders library."
4,Compelling Case for Commodities for the next decade,"Consider Hot Commodities a primer on investing in futures.As an investor, I too had considered futures to be too 'risky', that is until I read this book.Jim Rogers makes a very thoughtful and pursuasive case for why, over the coming decade, not investing in commodities would make an 'investor' seem handicapped. His fundamental analysis of the supply and demand of several commodities eg oil, sugar, lead, coffee alone would give the reader the basis for conducting his own research into futures trading.Indeed understanding the fundamentals of commodities could make one a better stock investor since there will always be companies involved in some way, shape or form with the 'things' that are commodities.I would recommend that you read this book if you want a very basic understanding of commodities and then proceed on to deepen your knowledge on this fascinating subject."
3,Option Trading Guru,This book inaccurately suggested that successfully trading commodities is as simple as buying and holding a position. It fails to mention the incredibly deep pockets and resolve that one must have to practice such a strategy.
4,Does not touch on inflation,"I would have easily given this phenomenal book a perfect 5/5 rating, except for one critique. Jim rogers does an outstanding job giving a opinion in a good read and does make alot of sense. I myself invest in commodities and stocks. And because this book was written 6 years ago it still has useful advice for a macro scale of investing. Now for the down side, the author disregards the fact that oil and commodities rose because of inflation, not just supply shortages. Supply and demand does infact dictate prices, but he talks so much of the 1970s without mentioning that America and many other countries went off the gold standard in August of 1971. The prices of everything due to the money printing in the 70's and free floating exchange rates contributed to a large part of the spike in commodities, which it should. It would have been easier for him to dedicate a short chapter to include that important reason for massive price spikes. Otherwise, enjoy."
2,"Dated and superficial, but probably broadly correct","I am not impressed with Rogers. He is too much of a talking head on Bloomberg, CNBC, and the other networks. Personally, I don't like this degree of self promotion. Soros, his former partner, said that he was a good analyst but a poor trader.This book on commodities is fairly general and would have been a three star book some years back. It is about long term investment as opposed to short term trading. Writing in 2012, the book is rather dated and not worth reading."
2,"Book covers the why, but not the How","The title is somewhat misleading. The book doesn't cover any specific strategies on how to take advantage of the coming bull market in commodities. The author does a good job of explaining commodities and the present (next 10 years) case for their appreciation. He also describes commodities markets and contracts/futures but I was disappointed that there was no coverage of how an investor would invest in them using his bull market forecast. As mentioned by other reviewers, most commodities based investments are reasonably complex derivatives.To be fair, this isn't a get rich quick book or a book on how to make short term plays on commodities. This to me was attractive. I bought the book believing commodities, as the author suggests, should be at the very least an important asset class for any portfolio. I'm still looking for a way (other then to invest in the author's own mutual fund which isn't available everywhere) to actually execute such a strategy."
2,Summarized in a few sentences...,"I can summarize this book in three sentences, saving everyone's money.1) China has a lot of people and those people need raw materials (commodities). I feel like the 214 page book would be about 100 pages if he would just make this one statement and move on.2) Commodities go in 17 year cycles and we still have awhile to go.3) Buy commodities because they are another media of investment that have proven to have good returns and diversify a portfolio. (Negative correlation to stock market.)If someone were to try to use this book to trade Futures they would have a very basic knowledge and most likely lose money. There are better books out there."
5,Worth Its Weight In Gold!,"Rogers' ""Hot Commodities"" is awesome! Jim does a fantastic job of laying out both the historical framework as well as capturing the depth and breadth of the importance of adding this asset class to an investment portfolio. Superior research that is well-cited combined with hands-on personal experience make this book a winner, a must-have for your personal investment library. Superb, 5 Stars!"
2,Nothing on how to get into commodities!,"I love Jim Rogers - And save all his online videosHowever, for me, this book was entirely uselessRogers explains why you must be in commodities - But I already knew thatRogers tells you NOTHING to help you to get into commodities!"
3,I like Jim...,"Well, I am a fan of Jim Rogers - tells it as it is, as far as I am concerned. His track record is second to none, and I always watch him on CNBC. This book was reasonably entertaining, but already a little out-dated, so 3 stars. The principles set out in the book still hold true, but there is not too much new if you are already invested in the commodity markets. I felt he could have gone a little deeper into causes and effects regarding weather, season, political upheavals, and other market movements (stocks and bonds are competitors for your cash) on the price movements in various commodities. If anyone knows, it's him. If you read this Jim, please let me know first if you bring out a book covering the aforesaid!"
4,commodities book,"This is the book I have been looking for even though it is not new. It gives direction to an area of investment which, I believe, will impact us greatly in the years ahead and offers much support for me to make my decisions with."
5,Highly Enjoyable,"Having read this book four years after being published, I thought Mr. Rogers had a crystal ball. His insightful forecast of future economics events is amazing. This book is a great read for those with a budding interest in commodities."
3,Not bad - I like the author's other titles better,"It was ok, it read like he was writing for a page count. His other books are much much better than this one. Read it if you want a view of the coming 'bull market' in commodities (maybe it peaked in 2008). I think he means that commodities will have more volatilty now than in past years. Perhaps a move back to volatility of the 1970s and 1980s. If that is the intent then I agree 100%."
3,good introduction but many inadequacies,"i share with one of the reviewers' frustration that the book i bought has no contents page and the page header does not show which chapter u are reading, it seems the book came out in a rush to sell his index fund,nevertheless it is a good introduction to the fundamentals of commodity trading - but one glaring omission is any analysis on silver, one of the most heavily traded, yet least researched commodity, perhaps he assumed that it just dances together with gold, but that's a big mistake, silver is (unlike gold) as much an industrial metal as a precious metal, interested readers could search ""butler research"" to find out"
3,Doesn't really tell you how to invest in commodities,"This book basically discusses economic theory behing what drives commodity prices and spends a lot of time discussing why China will drive the prices of commodities in the future. There is hardly any discussion about investing techniques. I guess the author assumes that you will be hiring a broker. One thing I don't understand is how the author tries to discredit the common belief that commodity trading is risky, yet he doesn't discuss why this is a myth. If this book was titled ""understanding commodities"" instead of ""how anyone can invest profitably"" I would not have a problem with is book. If you are a beginner who wants to do your own trading this book leaves you with a lot of unanswered questions."
1,not original quality?,"I replaced 3 of the 4 mounts on my 1994 Camry with Anchor mounts. The vibration was only slightly better, but I thought I had eliminated the mounts as the problem, so I spent more time and money checking other possiblities. Finally I took it to a auto shop, and they said that you have to use original mounts on this vechile, and sure enough the vibration is gone. The only problem is original mounts cost more than 4 times more. I am disappointed in the time and money lost, but happy that the problem is finally fixed."
3,Picking Up the Pieces After Divorce,"In Elizabeth Berg's novel, Open House, Sam (Samantha) must pick up the pieces of her and her son's life after her husband walked out on her.In the opening chapters, Samantha is full of sorrow and then rage as she charges up her husband's credit card at Tiffany's. As Sam comes to terms with the reality that her husband will not be coming back home, she realizes she has to make ends meet and satsify the mortgage payments. So she decides to open her house to roommates.Through the experiences with her new roommates, Sam finds the person she used to be and like. By opening her home, she was able to open her heart also.This was my first Elizabeth Berg novel and I plan on picking up more by this talented author."
3,Easy read that needs more character development,"I was intrigued by Elizabeth Berg's books and thought I'd check this one out. Like some others, I was completely expecting the bulk of the book to be in her relationships with her boarders, yet got nearly nothing of the kind. I was hoping her to have more meaningful, developed relationships with those people. I was also surprised to see that Sam's miscarriage didn't affect her more deeply; in the next paragraph we were on to some other trivial matter, like buying more Joy perfume (which can go for nearly $800 an ounce) or Tiffany silver.Predictable, yet I enjoyed it for something a little less heavy."
5,Great Book,"This book was interesting and easy to get into. You can really feel what the characters are going through, even you may have a completely different life. This was one of my favorite Oprah books."
5,great for newly divorced,"I thought the book captured the essence of feelings that a woman goes through when going through a divorce. Also gives hope for the future. Good, easy read."
3,Open House,"I have very mixed feelings about this book. I don't know if I liked this book, but I did not dislike it either..if that makes sense. Overall, I thought it was a great theme & realistic about the devastastion divorce leaves behind. I would have liked to know a little more about the marriage to feel her void as well. I also did not like how the passage of time is never address, therefore leaving things a bit inconsistent. IT could have been a much better book, but I like the writing styly & it kept me reading."
3,"Far from her best, but okay","First I read _Range of Motion_, then ""Pull of the Moon_, then _Talk Before Sleep_, and I love Elizabeth Berg. I liked _Durable Goods_ and ""Joy School_ less. _Open House_ is good, especially the middle of the book. I found myself a little lost about who this was at the start, and liked it more when some history and depth was given. I found the end predictable in regard to King. Also, I felt that the pregnancy was completely unnecessary. Also, much of the book just touched the surface of what it is like to get divorced. This tried to pull in too many things (date rape, pregnancy, motherhood, the wish to come back) and that detracted from the real story."
3,Good Book,"This was a pretty good book,you really connect with the main character. It's sometimes funny, sometimes sad, and sometimes leaves you saying "" you go girl!"""
3,i recommend another book ...,"i highly recommend another book - entitled ""JULIA'S MOTHER"" - written by an ER doctor practicing at a children's hospital. SO beautifully written, so poignant .... i couldnt put it down, didnt want it to end .... such a moving account of parents and their children at their most vulnerable, most heroic. Should be an OPRAH pick, too ....."
3,Try another,"Before I read this book I read Berg's ""Until the Real Thing Comes Along."" It is laugh-out-loud funny. Much better than ""Open House."""
3,Quick and Light,I powered through this book but not necessarily because it was a great read... It just happened to be a really fast one and it was enjoyable but could have used a little more depth.
1,Superficial and maddening,"When I was finished with this book I threw it across the room. In real life people going through a divorce do not just happen upon their moving man being a guy with a physics degree from MIT who is a philospher and the obvious love of their life.And of course the ex-husband comes crawling back just when our heroine has moved on to bigger and better things!If this is supposed to be how real people handle divorce or experience their family falling apart, it's just not that easy folks. Ugh!"
2,An Oprah Pick disappointment,"Since reading most of the Oprah Picks and having been impressed with the writing and theme of them, I was anxious to grab and begin this one immediately. However, I was most surprised to find this shallow and immature story! The same theme can be found in a more mature and moving story in Anne Rivers Siddons book Up Island. Open House had depressing and shallow characters--I thought Sam was pathetic!! Her husband, even more, and King has some kind of a huge problem--not the answer to life's mysteries!! This was my first experience with Elizabeth Berg --in all fairness, I should try one of her earlier books. This certainly was not worthy of any kind of recognition!"
5,Berg strikes gold again!,"I LOVE this book, it's probably my favorite of all the Oprah picks. What I especially love is how it tells the story of starting over, and the constant surprises, the little details, the exquisite writing, and that great blend of the comical and the sorrowful. Reminds me of Liz Rosenberg's novel HOME REPAIR, which has many of these same qualities. I don't know that I have ever truly loved any book that didn't make me laugh and cry--this does both. Berg is hit or miss for me, but on OPEN HOUSE it's a hit right out of the ballfield."
3,Starting over and learning a lot,"Loved the humor and the pathos.Loved the hero - an atypical one to be sure.Loved the ending!Well written and true to the issues of starting life over after a major change has been encountered.The new characters added to Samantha's life both enrich it and teach her lessons.Inspiring, funny, and very romantic."
2,Open house,"This is another of those books for me that was very ""middle of the road"". It was not terrible and it was not great. It was a bit slow for my tastes and the characters were very ordinary."
4,A great easy read . . .,"Though the story line was a bit depressing and caused me to analyze my own soon-to-be married life, I quickly became engaged with the book and its characters. While, I have never experienced divorce, I can imagine that the author has captured it accurately.I finished this book in about 2 days and at the end I was waiting for more! I would love a follow-up on King on Sam. All in all, the book is highly recommended"
2,Disappointing,"Though Berg is unquestionably a talented writer, this book was very disappointing in the morals it presented. I had a hard time feeling any sympathy for or emphathy with Samantha. It's difficult to feel sorry for a woman who drinks too much, goes home with a man, willingly gets into bed with him, then tries to call it ""date rape.""Though Berg sometimes hits a chord that resonates ""yes, this is the way women are,"" most of the time I find myself wondering where these women she writes about live. Because it surely isn't in any neighborhood I'm familiar with. The American women I know are much more selfless, moral, and loyal. I'd love to see Berg base a book on such characters. Her talent seems wasted on characters who have no integrity and go through life adrift, without a solid foundation."
4,A Peek at Life Post Divorce,"I have to admit, I was intrigued to read this book solely because of the Oprah show. The books I usually read are about younger women who're going through many of the same daily trials as I am. But this book is a great quick read!! You won't want to put it down! I really wanted to know how things would turn out for the main character, Sam. There are some great passages in the novel that made me giggle. For example when Sam spends $12,000 @ Tiffany's to get back at her ex-husband. Or when she starts taking in boarders to help pay for her mortgage. This is a nice read and most women will relate to Sam's anxieties, whims, and ultimately female empowerment towards the end. I enjoyed this novel and have passed it on to my mom so that she may enjoy it as well. Thanks Oprah!"
3,Fantasy,"I found many insights in this book, but overall what happens to Samantha is what we WISH would happen: she doesn't lose her house or her son. She makes great new friends, becomes empowered, and even meets a great new guy who loves her for who she really is. Her husband even tries to come back! All within, what, six months? Right. Well, in real life pretty much the opposite happens, but that's what makes this a decent working man's fantasy."
4,Touching--a book that divorced women will relate to,"Let me start by saying- I liked this book. Not perfect, but the characters are so warm and so easy to ""get inside of"", they felt like a familiar blanket. It's seldom that we read a frank, day-to-day picture of a divorced woman's struggle with her everyday life after the ""event"" has shocked her. Berg captured this beautifully. The changed relationships with your Mother, your kids,your ex, and of course, yourself. All very poignantly captured in this novel. And, the best part is, the book ends with hope and happiness. Sometimes you just need a read like this. This book spurred me on to read more Berg novels. Her style is simple, direct, and easy- with an uncanny ability to get you into her characters as your friends from the git! Good stuff."
3,Open House,Why did't Berg develop her characters better? I would have loved to know more about the people who came to live in her home. I kept hoping for more and did't get it!
3,Not enough of a story line,"From the very first page, I really felt like I could identify with the character - I have shared some of her insecure thoughts. But as the book went on, events happened too quick. I needed the author to elaborate more on some events. When the book was over, I felt like it was too soon. I needed more of a story line. But I liked the main character's thoughts and one liners - very funny and very realistic!"
3,Seemed to go on and on,"Not much of a story -- liked the first part and the main character, but it just went on and on."
4,A nice light read,"This was a nice book for the beach or for someone who is looking for an interesting light story. The main character was funny and sarcastic coping with the awful realization that her family was being torn apart by her husband moving out. At times a little too quirky, nevertheless it captured my attention and I rooted for the heroine which kept me coming back to see what happens next."
1,This book is a small notch above a Herlequin Romance,"Silly, predictable, the characters are more like caricatures. Oprah must have been drunk when she chose it. Do not recommend."
2,"Easy read, but nothing special...","I am not really sure how this one made Oprah's list. It was very easy to read, had an interesting style, but had no real depth to it at all. If you are looking for a book to pass the weekend, this could work. If you are looking for a read that will stick with you and work the brain, pick something else."
4,Love Elizabeth Berg; but this one was not my favorite,"Elizabeth Berg is my favorite author, and I buy all of her books sight unseen. In Open House she once again displays her remarkable talent of knowing women so well. She is so adept at expressing the thousands of emotions women go through dealing with relationships as a daughter, wife, mother, and friend. I pace myself reading all her books--to make them last. This was slightly disappointing because it was over too soon! Some parts are loaded with detail, and others are brushed over a bit too quickly. I found myself wishing that I could have stayed in Sam's life a little bit longer! Also, I noticed a slight change in her style--it was almost as if her editor advised her to spice it up a bit, because a couple of scenes seemed a bit more graphic than her usual style and almost like they were added in after the fact."
4,A Good Read!,"I'm not sure what I was expecting, but book took a rather typical plot (husband leaves wife, wife has to learn to survive on her own with little/no skills outside the home) and turned it into an extremely interesting story. The main character chooses to open her house to boarders to help pay the mortgage, and must learn to live with different personalities as well as learn to deal with reactions of family and friends to her new situation/decisions. I kept expecting her to ""get together"" with King, but there are some other interesting and unexpected twists along the way that took me totally by surprise! I enjoyed the writing of the author, especially how she puts what the main character is thinking right in line with what is actually said. It really ads human aspects to the writing! I hope to read more books by Berg."
1,Open House--close the door!,"After reading Talk Before Sleep and Durable Goods, I looked forward to reading any other books by Elizabeth Berg. I bought Open House in hardcover as I could hardly wait for her next story. I was so disappointed! How could a woman go to Tiffany's and spend such an incredibly ridiculous amount of money and then turn around and have to advertise for a boarder? It just seemed so weak..And so often the strength of the female characters in Ms. Berg's other books are what makes the stories so appealing. This women fell apart ( granted, all that scenerio was plausible) but when it came to the job market, she seemed so inept. I did like some of her characters; her son was realistically an 11 year old. But this time, Ms. Berg reached a bit too far to make this book a moving experience. Bottom line...I did not like the main character."
2,Bland without character depth,"I must agree with several others reviewers here, who've in my opinion, stated the obvious. This book was too short, too 'narrow' & greatly lacked character depth. I didn't ever feel I *knew* anyone in the story. Actions, not feelings which prompted them, seemed to be the point.I have been through divorce & know its scars. This book seemed to be about a different subject altogether... and I still have no idea what it was. I don't intend to read this author again."
2,Started Out Interesting,"The book started out interesting and you could feel some of what Sam was feeling when she was alone in the house after the divorce and eating Thanksgiving dinner alone. And then King comes along, which even the name makes you envision him as huge. I just couldn't picture her falling in love with a fat guy, no matter how much she was hurt in the past. Her relationship with her son went back and forth so much, him hating her and him actually being nice to her that you just wanted to slap both of them. I would've liked the story better had she stayed by herself. Just another way of telling women that you are nothing without a man.....frankly I'm sick of hearing it."
3,House party,I would recommend this to anybody who loves a good story and wants a book that is impossible to put down.
2,"Sappy, Silly Fantasy of Divorce","This is not a good book; while it has both comedic and dramatic potential, both are squandered so that Elizabeth Berg's Sam can ditch her already abandoned son, invite potentially dangerous renters into her house, and waste time on friends that seem more contrived than an episode of,""Friends"". One more point: a Boston blue-blood such as David would not - in reality - marry a southern woman such as Sam, it's just not possible. If the laws of reality could be bent to allow such a union, could you actually believe that Sam would not know how to buy silver?"
5,A great book to get lost in,"I read this book at a time in my life when I was very overwhelmed and sad and angry. I had read a few other Elizabeth Berg books, but this is my favorite. I think this is because it adds humor into the mix. I laughed out loud and cried at various times while reading it -- occasionally at the same time! My favorite memory of this book is when they had a prowler outside the house and the ... male roommate says ""we need a man around here!"" (They didn't of course -- I think this book is about making your own way AND finding love.) I also loved how King was a very laid back person, yet still very smart and fascinated by learning and doing -- a perfect kind of man, in my estimation. I really enjoyed this book."
1,A dreary woman with a dreary tale,"Open House was one of the most tiresome novels I have read in recent memory. The protagonist has lived a privileged life, and upon the demise of her marriage decides to soothe her pain through the purchase of jewelry and fine china. When her soon to be ex-husband mandates a stricter budget, our heroine decides that she must become independent of this unreasonable ogre. She hasn't worked in her adult life, and takes in boarders and takes on sub-standard jobs to survive. How can we feel sympathy for a woman who whines incessantly and who creates the very problems in which she finds herself?..."
2,"No stabbing of the heart, here...","When I saw this book being discussed on Oprah, I was convinced that I should run to the bookstore and read away. Well, I did. I was disappointed because recently being ""dumped"" myself, I related to some of the issues she touched on, but it seemed to me that she wasn't going for the jugular. My heart was ripped out of me, pureed in a blender and then flushed down the toilet. Somehow, Sam just seemed stronger and a lot better than what was expected. I was looking for tears and they were there, but they just weren't forced out and I thought that this story would do that. Oh well..."
2,Cliche-ridden and predictable - what was Oprah thinking?,"I've enjoyed most of the selections by Oprah's book club ... until I tripped on this one. ""Open House"" was predictable from page 1. The newly divorced woman who feels like her insides have been shredded? The teenage son who misses his Dad? The fat man with a heart of gold? The old lady who drinks tea and gives wise counsel? Although I found all of the characters interesting, none of them was surprising or all that loveable. They were simply fleshed out cliches. The best thing I can say for this book is that I learned some neat passive-aggressive tricks in case my man does me wrong. In which case his boxers are toast."
2,"Nice, but lacking depth.","Great story line. I was unable to put the book down. I wanted to know more & I was hoping there would be more. But it lacked depth and conversation. I was unable to get to ""know"" the characters and who they were. I thought it was a great description of a relationship and what it's like when it's over. But to be honest I couldn't wait for the book to be over. I guess even Oprah's Book Club can pick a loser."
4,Predictable but charming story,"""Open House"" is a fun interesting read about a woman who is going through a major change in her life-divorce. I really enjoyed the character of King and the boarder ""Lavender Blue"", as well as a definitely different Thanksgiving celebration! This book makes us believe that things really can be ok and even better after ending a relationship."
3,A perfect movie for Lifetime Television,"Open House has the makings of a cute tv movie. You have the main character who desperately wants to improve her life after her husband leaves her. Her son has an attitude problem that in my book could be cured with a visit to a good old-fashioned wood shed. But at least the people she rents rooms out to have fun and interestine lives. My favorite tenant was Lydia, the elderly woman who has boyfriend and tells Samantha to ""lighten up"" and move on with her life. Luckily Samantha tries by taking outragous temp jobs and tries to date. I love the scene where she gets a call from Martha Stewart."
1,Shallow and full of cliches,"I have read many of Oprah's book club books, among numerous others, but have usually found most of them to be very interesting, deep, well written, etc. Many I can count as my favorites. This selection was soooooooooo off to me, I have a hard time beleiveing that Oprah actually picked it!! I mean I truly wonder, how could this be??! I feel like sending her a note. Wondering WHY?? The writing is so pedestrian and sophmoric, the characters so shallow and one note, and the whole entire premise is one big horrendous cliche. I was put off immediately after only a few pages. Anyway, I dont recommend this book at all."
2,"pretty shallow, mildly amusing","This story, while it kept my attention, did not get real deep or moving. Most of Oprah's choices really make you think...this one was superficial enough to read quickly, but with no real substance. The main player, Sam, seemed too flighty to be taken seriously (wait until you see how much and what she eats). She pines for her ex-husband for months, then when totally out of the blue he wants to come back to her, she says no. What purpose did her miscarriage serve to the story? I guess I'm not unhappy I read it, but would not care to read it again, nor would I recommend it to a friend."
5,A Gem of a Book,I finished this book in one weekend. It was my first experience reading a book by Elizabeth Berg and it was wonderful. She so accurately described experiences you go through in a divorce but did it with a gentle touch of humour. I was not able to put it down. Would highly recommend this book.
3,A woman picks up the pieces after divorce,"I would have liked to give this 3 1/2 stars rather than 3 or 4 because I didn't feel it was quite worth 4 stars. It was an easy, pleasant read, somewhat predictable, with a bit of quirkiness to keep me reading til the end.I never quite understood why Sam's husband leaves and I feel his character could have been developed more, giving us some insight as to why he left.Next, King appears to be a promising character, with his odd name, large size and easy-going manner. But Ms. Berg takes the path of predictability in developing his character and Sam's relationship with King and I was disappointed at the lost potential.Ms. Berg is very adept at subtly demonstrating the strengthening of Sam's character as well as the underlying turmoil her son experiences as he witnesses his mother's struggle.I did enjoy this because it's a story many can relate to - struggling with the aftermath of separation and divorce."
4,Warms your heart and opens your eyes......,"Samantha is a women who has just had the rug of her life pulled out from under her. Her husband has left and is seeking a divorce. She realizes that although it felt like it had come from ""out of the blue"", it had really been building for a very long time. She attempts to come to terms with what she sees as a major obstacle to happiness in her life and begins to learn about herself, love and true happiness. She learns lessons from her mother, the people she rents rooms in her home too, and some other very interesting characters. Along the way, her choices in how she deals with her failed marriage will both enchant, amuse and horrify you!! Elizabeth Berg creates a story that warms your heart and opens your eyes to life's possibilities."
4,Enjoyable as Always,"Elizabeth Berg is becoming another Ann Tyler in my mind--I love her characters and their attitudes and reactions just as much as I always have Tyler's. She takes unpleasant subjects and makes them bearable and interesting--not to mention humourous in some ways. Am surprised that some readers have criticized the book for being depressing--divorce can never be anything else--regardless of how you deal with it. When I was divorced, I was only 28 with no children and my whole life ahead of me--I never looked back; which isn't to say it wasn't mind shattering. For a middle aged woman with a child, it has to be positively devastating! I think this book showed women how there is something positive in even the most menial job and that nice people, and even love, can come disguised in the plainest brown wrappers."
3,Enjoyable,"This book rang true in many places. I thought it was an easy read and would recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy a good story. I read the other reviews, and while I agree it was full of stereotypes, it still held my interest."
3,The Viscisitudes of Revolving Doors.,"When I read this, Sam is reeling from a divorce after twelve years of marriage and has an eleven-yr-old son to provide for. Open House is a love story about what can blossom between a man and a woman, and within a woman herself. She endures the loneliness of being without a man, then takes in boarders -- none of whom fit exactly. So, as happens, she finds another man only he demands too much.Sam has a mother who wants her married again, instead of helping raise the boy. It is the classic picture of being left in the lurch on your own, only this time you have baggage you can't discard. Divorce is never pretty, but the feeling of love the second time around is worth it and more!"
4,A few hours' good read,"I had read two of Elizabeth Berg's earlier books and enjoyed them. This one is also enjoyable but very light and a very quick read; I finished it off on a Sunday evening in about 3 hours. I am not for sure why Oprah had chosen this book as one of her club selections as opposed to perhaps ""Open Range"" a much more complex but just as enjoyable read.The subject of this book is divorce and its affects on the woman left behind and her son. The main character, Samantha, is well written and generates your sympathy. Her son is also well written having the proper amount of angst exhibited for an 11-year-old without being a caricature. However, there are secondary characters that are not quite as fleshed out as they should be; for example, I could never get a real grasp on either Samantha's mother nor her best friend.I would recommend this book as pleasant rainy day reading but not for any in-depth study."
4,*Entertaining*,"This book was a joy to read. It wasn't taxing on the intellect, but had some great insights. I laughed out loud on numerous occasions. I think the title of the book could have been more alluring, like ""Martha Stuart, Not!"" or something humorous. It could be argued that the secondary characters are a bit stereotypical and the storyline somewhat predictable, but, hey, I was sorry when the novel came to an end. I'd recommend it as a pick-you-up if you're feeling under the weather."
3,"Pretty boring, pretty disapointed!","Elizabeth Berg has been one of my favorite authors for quite sometime. However, I wonder what happened to her? It's not that this book is not enjoyable. I just kept thinking it would get deeper and the story would take off. When I finished...the one thought that came to mind... this could have been a short story in the back of a woman's magazine!I can't say that I would buy her next book. Maybe wait to rent it from the library!"
2,Open House,"In real life, how often does the rich, successful husband want to come back to the worthy wife? In real life, how often does the fat moving guy end up not only losing weight but also -- surprise! -- having a degree in astrophysics from MIT? 'Nuf said."
2,Predictable and Shallow,"This book was a dissapointment. There is no depth to the characters. There is also no description - I didn't even have the slightest idea of what Sam looked like. King was unrealistic - he was so fat that he'd only had one sexual experience. Yet when he lost 40 lbs, he was a dream. That doesn't make sense!The main story line was very predictable and the rest of the story seemed to have no point for being.This was a quick, breezy read, but not worth the time."
4,A light touch on a heavy subject,"""Open House"" is a thoroughly enjoyable and fast read. Fix yourself a cup of tea, recline in a favorite chair, and let Elizabeth Berg entertain you with a lighthearted look at a woman's path to self-discovery.The characters are believable and well rounded. When her husband of many years leaves, Samantha opens her house to borders. All of this new human contact helps to heal her wounds and open her soul to a new look on life. You'll root for Samantha and her son, and you'll love the many colorful people who enter their lives.Don't expect to find any lectures or moralizing about divorce in ""Open House."" This is simply a slice-of-life book that offers hope for those who need to heal."
1,Not the author I've come to know...,"I am a huge fan of Elizabeth Berg's work but, unfortunately, this isn't her best work. I found it easy and full of the easy way out. I could see each path and storyline before it ever ended up happening. It lacked challenge and intrigue. I have come to expect wonderful things from this amazing author but, this one just didn't do it for me. Not worth your time or money. Try her other works. You'll be happy there."
2,What HAPPENED to the author of Talk Before Sleep???,"I have been a fan of Elizabeth Berg, but after her last two books I'm beginning to wonder what happened to the excellent author who explored women's issues through characters who displayed strength and character. Sam is a simpering, needy character. The author's answer to her problems with self worth is to 'give' her another man to make her a happy woman. This was the same solution Ms. Berg gave her female character in Until the Real Thing Comes Along. Please stop, Elizabeth!!! Give your readers more books like Pull of the Moon and Talk Before Sleep, and I'll return to being your very vocal fan."
2,Great idea with no development,Despite the accurate portrayal of the emotions that are experienced during a divorce Ms. Bergs book at best is mediocre. She took the time to develop a few of the characters but it was almost as if she got to a point and decided that she had better finish the book and just slapped a generic ending on it. I was hoping for something a little more realistic to flow with the feelings that she developed in the beginning. It is unfortunate that this book was selected to Oprahs book club.
3,Open House,"I am noticing there are a lot of negative reviews about this book. I liked this book enough. It was enjoyable enough for me to read it in only a few short days and actually look forward to it. I thought the character's ""weaknesses"" were true to form to those experiencing divorce. I also thought her over spending was not as unrealistic as other reviewers. It was a coping mechanism & I think the author was very good at showing how this woman coped whether they were healthy or unhealthy ways. The biggest downfall was the lack of a time frame, therefore making things less genuine. It is hard to understand with all that happens if it is realistic when a time frame was not specified."
4,Shallow and disappointing,"I usually enjoy Berg's stories, but this was far too predictable and too shallow. This topic can be approached with humor (after the fact) or grief, but Open House does neither. I'd borrow it or skip it, but definately save your money for a better ""read""."
2,"i recommend another book ,,,","i highly recommend another book - entitled ""JULIA'S MOTHER"" - written by an ER doctor practicing at a children's hospital. SO very beautifully written, so poignant.... i couldnt put it down, didnt want it to end ....."
2,Nope,"Open house is a book about a woman who tries to keep her failing marriage together, but doesn't succeed.In the meantime she tries to stay afloat while taking care of her son by renting her home out to strangers.I almost liked this book, but there was something keeping me from doing that.The plot of the book seemed interesting but this author just didn't pull it off in my opinion.This was just another book that passed time for me."
3,Not One of Best Oprah Picks,"I think I have read almost all of Oprah's picks, but this one does not stand out from the pack. I have been divorced and I had a really hard time identifying with the main character's actions and reactions. It is just not memorable to me, nor outstanding but merely average. I have noticed that many reviewers rave about this book, but I wonder if the ""Oprah effect"" is not one of the main reasons."
4,Short but nice,"I think the book started off nicely but was sort of predictable at the end. This book deals with Samantha, whose husband divorced her and she had to deal with raising her 11 year-old son and she needed to learn to be independent financially and emotionally.It would be more interesting if the author develops the supporting characters better and the main character, Samantha's relationship with her mother remains ""hostile"". Despite its shortcomings, it is still an interesting book to read."
3,Very sweet book,"I really enjoyed this book. I didn't think it was very ""deep"" but it was enjoyable. It is the perfect vacation book."
3,A time in your life you don't really want to revisit,"There are a lot of women out there for whom the painful experience of divorce is fresh, and for those women, this would probably be a good book. But for those of us who went through it years ago and have moved beyond it, it's a time you don't really want to go back to. For that reason, I never really emotionally connected with the story. Also, am I wrong, or did Sam only start to feel better about herself once she found another man? It would have been better if she had recaptured her self-esteem before she realized her feelings for King. And what really would have been special is if she had fallen in love with King without his losing weight."
2,a little soap opera like,"I enjoyed reading this book yet I have to admit I was a little taken aback by some superficialities that didn't go with the rest of a well written book. Like where it says that King was with a woman only once before! I mean that is not impossible yet instead of helping the reader relate to full dementional characters, the book creates phony ones. Lydia and her boyfriend are also not very realistic characters. Rita the best friend is another phony character. But the very fact that Sam moves thru a difficult time and comes out in a good shape is heartwarming."
2,Not as enlightening as expected,"I thought the book was weak. I read the words, but didn't feel the emotions the book may have intended the reader to feel. It was a good story, but without much depth. An easy read."
4,Open House equals Open Heart,"If you're having difficulties facing new challenges and obstacles that life often throws our way, read this book. It shows you how someone who is complacent must all of a sudden begin to move into who she really is as a person and a mother. Always providing for her child and never scared of a little hard work. The character is everything we want to be or rather should be. She adapts to any situation with poise and ease. Never losing her temper, dignity, or love for life!"
2,I didn't like the main character,"""Open House"" is the second novel I have read of Elizabeth Berg's. I read her first book, Durable Goods, which I liked so much better than this one.The writing was very well done, but the character of Sam was very annoying and acted rather immaturely. I don't identify with her and didn't sympathize with her much at all.Her husband has left her. Her preteen son is distant, and grows even more so.Sam takes in boarders so she can keep her house. She's meeting new people and trying to get in touch with Martha Stewart. One new friend, King - the best character in the whole story - helps open her eyes and heart to more after a heart wrenching marriage ending.Open House is a novel about divorce and how one woman's life changes after. The character of sam seemed so innane at times I wanted to stop reading, but Berg's writing kept me hooked. She is very talented."
4,Definitely worth reading but don't expect much.,"This was a better than average cheesy novel, and I can appreciate that. There wasn't the normal groans at cliched situations. I actually haven't been able to get 'into' a book in awhile - which is amazing for me - and I was pleasantly surprised to see myself getting hooked onto this one.The one problem I had with it was Sam's relationship with King. It was just so obvious. Too cliched. She mourned for I think a week, then this new man comes into her life. If only it could be so easy! I tried to put the King situation aside so I could gather some pick-me-up-after-a-breakup empathy from Sam. I wasn't really able to do it, but at least it's keeping me occupied."
4,"Good, easy read","Open House is one of those books that you can just dive in, forget the clock and read until you've finished it. Berg does a good job of capturing the fear, desperation and exhiliration experienced by Sam, the book's protagonist, after her husband abruptly leaves their 20 year marriage.Wanting to keep her house, Sam begins renting the basement and study to what becomes an ecclectic and endearing cast of characters. I thouroughly enjoyed Lydia, the 80 year old newlywed, and King the sensitive MIT grad who takes odd jobs for a living in order to ""learn everything.""Although I found a few holes, Open House is a delightful read, perfect for a lazy summer day."
3,A GREAT WAY TO SPEND AN AFTERNOON,THIS IS AN ENJOYABLE READ FOR A WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN THROUGH THE TOUGH CHANGES THAT A CRUMBLING MARRIAGE BRINGS. SOME OF THE CHARACTERS AND STORY TWISTS ARE NOT ALWAYS BELIEVABLE BUT THAT'S WHAT FICTION IS I GUESS.I FOUND IT OVERALL A VERY RELAXING READ ON A LAZY SUMMER PATIO. ELIZABETH BERG KNOWS THE CHAOTIC THOUGHTS OF A WOMAN IN TURMOIL AND THE LIGHTER SIDE OF UNCERTAINTY.
3,An easy read,This book was ok... at least I finished it. The one thing that aggravated me was that the main character was blind to her admirer. This book is good if you are looking for a quick mindless read.
2,Take a Pass if you want...anything,"Slow...kept waiting for something to happen and it never did. The end should ahve been in the middle and a whole other ending created. Likable characters keep you reading, but worth a pass. Read with a book club - average rating for 6 people was 2."
1,"[...], flat characters, predictable story line..","I was very unimpressed by this book, how has this woman gotten other things published? The book went way too fast to the predictable ending, the author didn't spend enough time developing the characters, the plot was stupid: Newly divorced woman tried to ""find herself"" and pay off her mortgae by taking in borders. If the author had concentrated more on the boarders, developing the characters more, not using so many dumb stereotypes, like she picked the characters out of sitcom, then maybe...this book would have been worth something."
1,You've Got to Be Kidding --,"A quick skate over the surface of the ending of a marriage. Some good lines and some points recalled from my own marriage and/or relationship dissolutions, but, all in all, a gentle walk in the same park where most of us trod, sorely in need of combat boots and comouflage for protection, over the rocks and fissures of a dying or dead relationship. I'm left feeling Sam got off too easy to be very believeable."
4,Awfully Good,"Wonderfully believable characters, especially King, a jewel of a guy with a positive and upbeat attitude towards life. I found myself laughing out loud during parts of the book. The chapter on Sam's Thanksgiving dinner is both funny and heartbreaking. As always, Ms. Berg's way with words paints pictures in your mind of the characters and settings making you believe they actually exists. I have read everything Ms. Berg has written, twice. This book is not my favorite, (""Talk Before Sleep"" is at the top of my list) but it is awfully good and definitely worth reading."
1,Would give it zero stars if I could,"This book was horrible. I couldn't finish reading it, which is saying a lot because I hate to waste my hard earned money on a book that I can't read. I can't believe this was an Oprah choice. Not that I read books or do anything else because Oprah suggests it. I read another one of her book choices and found it to be an entertaining read. But not this one.The characters in this book seemed shallow. Sam seemed to be more of a ditz than a woman crushed by an estranged husband. The son seemed very immature for his age. Maybe this was just from the way he was written.OK, I can't say much more because I didn't read the whole book. I will say I tried though, it just wasn't worth my time. The only reason I'm writing the review is to advise others to not even waste their time on this poorly written book."
1,give me a break,I'm sorry I wasted the afternoon reading it....was about the worst thing I have ever read in its category. Would have liked to rate it as NO stars but that is not an option. Just happened to read it because it has been sitting here for 4 years since my mom died and I took it
3,Stuffing Anyone?,"I have to actually giggle as I think back to one of the funniest scenes revolving around human behavior I have ever read. The Thanksgiving scene in ""Open House"" is truly unforgettable.Ms. Berg brings to life, Sam, in a most unique witty way. We follow her adventures of lost love, re-gained self-esteem, terrorizing teens as if it is happening to us. In fact, I think that is the whole point of this book--weird stuff happens, deal with it.A fun, psych of a book.Thank you for your interest & comments--CDS"
2,Pathetic is right...,"There have been some real winners on Oprah's list but this one definately wasn't one of them. I agree with a reviewer who said that Sam was pretty pathetic and they were right, 100%.The fact that Sam IS so pathetic leads me to say that when David tries to come back to her and she doesn't take him - well, that's just plain unbelievable considering what we already know about her.And that 'seduction' scene. Awful - I don't know if it was in fact terrible, or if the whole thought of that happening was so horrible to even imagine.I hate to think there are women as simple and limp as her out there. How sad.I give this book 2 stars because I couldn't relate and because I thought the main character was so...so...well, stupid."
3,Just OK,"Expected more from this book than what I got. It's a quick read, and Berg's style is brilliant, but the storyline leaves something to be desired."
1,pathetic,"I do not appreciate this book at all and it is offensive to me that people call this every women's book. Sorry, No. This book did not compensate in writing for what it lacked in character and plot. The main character was so pathetic it made me sick. How sorry does a women have to be that she cannot think of anything to do with herself but eat Godiva chocolates and spend 12,000 at Tiffany's? How unconscience does a women have to be to realize (after a fraction of her life is spent married to this man) that her husband does not love her?? To me this book lacked good writing, which would explain all the name dropping, (Martha Stewart, Godiva, Tiffany's etc.) I am saddened that so many women relate to this poor pathetic women's story."
2,Disappointed,"I, too, am an avid Elizabeth Berg fan, but I agree with scm326 in her review, that this book seems to be written by an entirely different person! It didn't make me care about Sam or her life. The characters never got a chance to develop. Just when things were looking interesting...it was cut off. Like her older ""roommate"" goes off and gets married? Her husband finally wants to come back, but it's too late, and it's over in one sentence....! I was really disappointed and am already hoping for a new book that I can ""gobble up"", like Durable Goods and Joy School!"
4,A Good Discovery Novel,This was an enjoyable story about a woman who discovers herself and life in the face of divorce. Very thought provoking and well written. The writer did an excellent job at making me feel the characters feelings. Enjoyable.
2,OH PLEASE!,I was really into enjoying this book and i must say that the author has a way of conveying PAIN. But despite the fact that her main heroine was to be strong and a role model ... she failed miserably. i read through the entire book awaiting a wonderful ending only to be COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED.
5,The 2nd Best 70's Revival Band So Far,"Forget about Jet, forget the Darkness, forget the Datsuns, forget the D4. You can definitely forget about The Donnas and Sahara Hotnights. The only two bands of this type that matter are the Burning Brides and Silvertide. I spend a lot of time listening to music, in fact I do it for a living (and no I don't work in a record store), and I have not heard a band that sounds this authentic. References to the Black Crowes, Zeppelin, and even Pearl Jam. These guys rock hard and you know they must be doing something right when Clive Davis signs them to his label. Buy the CD or listen to a couple samples on the iTunes store. Unless you are completely hopeless, you will like this band. And if you don't, God help you."
5,In Aww,"When I walked into the rekord Store and saw a 4.00$ cd sitting at the counter i picked up along with the Kyuss Cd i was buying. although American Excess has only three tracks, they are well worth the experiance. I was awwed by silvertides talents. I was also happy to hear some real rock and roll for once. this band is really going some where and out of my fivehundred cds this makes the top 20."
5,THE NEXT ROCK GREATS!,"I would just like to say that these guys totally kick ass and M. Hinkle is a dumbass. No one listen to him. Silvertide's american excess is way better then anything Van Halen has released forever and the three songs on this cd are way better then Van Halen's Three new songs. Also, Nick Perri is a god on the guitar and not a copy cat of Van Halen. Van Halen did rock, when they had David Lee Roth. They are going to be the saviors of rock and roll and their full length album show and tell is awesome to. Go out and buy it right now if you do not have it."
5,"Ideal for children, timeless story.","In this CD The Man Who Planted Trees is effectively narrated by Robert J. Lurtsema and complemented with the beautiful music of the Paul Winter Consort.At approximately 40 minutes in length, this story on CD is great for children, too. Not only will it help to teach them the importance of developing and maintaining a strong environmental ethic, but it will also expose them to quality music featuring the sounds of such instruments as the piano, cello, bass, and Paul Winter on soprano sax. It is an ideal CD to play for children during car trips.--reviewed by N.Glenn Perrett"
4,"fun, historical entertainment","Based on real people and actual events, but with a lot of Safire thrown in. Safire does a great job of capturing the era, both in its speech and, more importantly, in its political divisions. For those who like to complain (often justifiably) about media bias nowadays, it helps to realize that it used to be about 10 times worse.This is a good book, but not great. I was not so much captivated by the personal elements of the story as I was by all the political maneuvering that occurred. Frankly, I couldn't get enough of that part of the story, and the story's premature ending was frustrating, though true to history."
2,I've read biographies more artistic,"I know a lot about history, though I'm no historian. I can say with all honesty I have read actual HISTORY books more interesting than this. This book was mostly facts, with a small amount of description put in. There was no deep character analysis, no beautiful descriptions, and no real theme. It assumes that you'll be so shocked to find out about the naughty things historical figures have been involved in that you don't need and actual good story. In fact, I got more enjoyment from reading Alexander Hamilton, a biography from Ron Chernow, than from reading this.What follows spoils some of the story, so don't read it if you actually plan on buying it.The author also asserts the ridiculous (at least in my opinion) belief that Alexander Hamilton FORGED letters to make it look like he was being blackmailed, and was actually engaging in shady financial dealings with JAmes Reynolds. Though I admit to slight bias (I adore Hamilton), this is a claim is unbelievable."
4,"An intriguing, difficult read","William Safire attemps in his latest tome, ""Scandalmonger"" to bring us to the 'gates' of the founding of our country by illuminating scandals that plagued the Founding Fathers. Ah, to sit back and reminisce about the olden days, and how perfect everything was back then. Balderdash. As Safire points out, early American politics were strife with gossip, rumors, and a media out for blood. It's makes that whole Clinton thing pale in comparison to adulterous behavior, extortion, and other juicy tidbits which shaped our destiny, almost bringing down the Nation as well.Not five stars because of a challenging read, Safire often sprinkles names throughout the story that I found sometimes confusing. For the casual history buff, or the more experienced devotee, ""Scandalmonger"" is sure to please!"
2,Safire is No Novelist,"I usually love this kind of novel, but Scandalmonger offers precious few of the usual novelistic pleasures. There is very little scene-setting, all of the characters seem two-dimensional and generic, and the dialogue is stiff. Here's the work of a man who's done all the research, and has the intelligence to cobble it all together into a plot, but who sorely lacks the ability to bring his material alive as a work of art. My advice: For historical fiction of this type, stick with Gore Vidal (e.g. Burr, 1876, and the truly wonderful Washington DC). Vidal may be a little looser with the facts, but he offers a far more satisfying reading experience."
4,The Private Lives of the Founding Fathers,"Safire's Scandalmonger is an excellently written and well researched novel. I've read many biographies of Washington, Adams, Hamilton, Jefferson and the rest and this historical fiction rates amongst the best books I've read this year. It provides new insights on the founding fathers from the point of view of the early investigative reporter, James Callender. If you think of the founding fathers as icons above reproach, you may find this book a bit disconcerting. However, if you want to know these historical figures as real people, with personal as well as public motivations, this book is a must."
4,So NOW I get it ...,"I thought this book was great, especially since it made my reading list as a ""should"" not a ""want to"". Reading this novel, and keeping track of all the players, with a full understanding of all the political issues of the time made me feel smart. (Trust me, I realize how dumb you think I am now.) This is what the other reviewers are talking about when they describe ""Scandalmonger"" as being what history class should have been like, and when they describe how engrossing they find each episode. Safire engages the reader by providing enough information on each character to bring them alive, and his explanations of the motivations of the characters make them believable. He is also highly successful in revealing the story-behind-the-story, which readers always love. Add ""Scandalmonger"" to your reading list. You won't be disappointed."
5,The best book I've ever read!,My review cannot ever do this book justice. I read it about a year ago and I still find myself reflecting on it. It truly is an astounding book written in beautiful language that captures the reader's imagination and places them in the middle of a fascinating historical scandal. I found myself reading this book for continuous hours not wanting to put it down. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in history or politics (I love both). I can't say enough about this book except this: READ IT!!
3,The drama of the time saves an otherwise slow read,"If you want good historical fiction, read Patrick O'Brian. Safire does not even come close. Scandalmonger is as woodenly written as so many of the history books I had to read in high school. It also repeats facts over and over and over again. One other reviewer also caught Safire's biggest boo-boo, the Hamilton-couldn't-be-President problem. But all is not bad. I give the book three stars (and not less) because the story is so intrinsically fascinating. And the latter half or so picks up considerably, especially in light of the DNA evidence that has linked Jefferson to Sally Hemings. Callender was onto something, it seems! (For an interesting perspective on this problem, readers may want to have a look at Max Byrd's Jefferson.) Anyone interested in the Federal and Jeffersonian periods will be drawn along, albeit slowly, by the new look at possibly THE key moments in our country's history."
2,Sheryl cuss like it aint hot no more...lol,"I think Sheryl is a great comedian. However, this dvd was not that funny. I expected a lot more from her...thats all i got to say.Sista Winnie"
5,So funny!,"Sheryl Underwood is great! She had my friend and I laughing throughout the standup. Only for mature audiences thoughHowever, I bought this directly from Amazon and they were the slowest shippers. All the other products that I bought were shipped and arrived before expected."
5,Great Video!!!,"I love Sheryl, she kept it completely real. I watched this video twice as soon as I got it."
3,My ears are still bleeding,I have one of the most open since humor then most but Sheryl even had me cringing at times. An over excessive amount of profanity is not always good comedy. But I'm still a Sheryl Underwood fan!
2,Very little laughs,"I'm a big Sheryl Underwood fan. However, this DVD is not much to laugh at. Weak humor and more preaching than anything. Is it me or does she have her pocket book on her shoulder the whole time? LOL. Good thing the price was low, I don't feel so bad for my loss."
2,Read something else,"This particular Forgotten Realms book set in the Fighter Series is interesting for only one reason; the protagonist gains the ability into a very odd type of animal. As to the story, in order to save their people Vell the Brown and the rest of his barbarian tribe are commanded by the voice of their totem to seek the Thunderbeasts in the High Forest. Along the way this mission is complicated by Zhentil Keep baddies and Vell has to deal with the odd abiltiy he's acquired.Not a very good FR story and it was hard to sit with a staight face through some of the ridiculous action that takes place. Eventually I just had to put the book down. If you're a Forgotten Realms reader and a fan of the Fighter series Ghostwalker and Bladesinger are both better choices. 2 out of 5 stars."
5,A nail biting suspense novel,"I could'nt put this book down! I immediately got lost in Soderberg's use of imagery and color. He is a beautiful writer that allures the reader right from the start. If you want to learn about Afghanistan's past/present culture, children and the Taliban, this book is for you!"
2,"Good idea, poor presentation.","The author needs to take creative writing classes. The language was stilted, and the dialogue artificial, both deadly sins in my opinion, especially when the subject - kids being trained as terrorists - could have been so compelling. I confess, I could not finish it."
5,awesome,"I have followed them every since they were ""Coming out hard"" they haven't let me down yet! I think they are real poets and have creative minds.Greatly displayed on titled track ""Strong armed robery"". nigga's can't comprehend nor feel you."
3,On Edge,"If you know anything about our amateur and professional skaters, you'll get a kick out of the similarities of the cast of characters in this movie. It was kinda funny except for the some of the language."
5,"Too true, too funny","You don't have to be a figs fan to enjoy this hilarious mockumentary about the world of figure skating. I saw this in its brief appearance in the theatres a couple of years ago, and was completely stoked to see it released on DVD.We watched it with a crowd of figure skating people immediately after Ladies Finals from Worlds in Germany-what a great juxtaposition! The loony in the tutu skating out on the ice during Michelle's warm up, followed by this lulu of a movie. Wendie Malick is perfect as the over involved skating mother-do I know a few like her! And the girl who plays bad girl skater JC Cain needs to be a star-she was wonderful! ""It's hard to be Courtney Love when they want Celine Dion.""There really needs to be a sequel with pairs and dance covered, as well as the whacky world of international competition."
5,WICKEDLY FUNNY!!!!!,I just lucked into seeing this movie. It was slap-your-knee funny and the mockumentary style was perfect. I can't believe I didn't hear about it before. It was delightful.
5,"A Figure Skating ""Waiting for Guffman""","This ""mock documentary"" comedic slap at the often times pretentious world of ""I'll act sweet for the public, but really I'll drive a knife in your back to get ahead"" female U. S. Olympic figure skating is HYSTERICAL! Jason Alexander, Wendi Malick and John Glover may be only out performed by Marissa Winokar."
2,When a good idea goes bad....,"In the style of ""Best in Show"" and ""Waiting for Guffman,"" this movie is a behind the scene look at ladies figure skating. If you can get past the stupid fat jokes and bad writing the only highlight is Scott Hamilton. Mr. Hamilton is actually very funny and the movie would have been much more interesting if it was just a monologue of Scott Hamilton's character."
3,So so,"Just like 'Best in Show' and 'Drop Dead Gorgeous', this is a mockumentory about the competitive world of figure skating. It wasn't a bad movie, but it didn't deliver the goods as well as it could have.While Drop Dead Gorgeous had me laughing on the floor with tears in my eyes, On Edge only brought out a mild chuckle or two. There's the fat girl (she can do a triple! My God she can do a triple!), the girl being pushed too hard by her mother, the 'bad' girl, and a motley crew of skaters each wanting to win the coveted Golden Horn trophey at regionals.Scott Hamilton was hilarious and possibly the high point of the movie. The dude from Seinfeld was OK as the Zamboni driver. All in all, I can give this movie an 'OK' but that's about it."
2,Miss Dottie,"My daughter absolutely LOVES this doll! Since she has curly red hair just like my daughter, she was a big hit!However, Miss Dottie's red hair sheds all over EVERYTHING. My beige carpet in my daughter'r room needs to be vaccumed constantly, and my daughter's tights and blankets need a lint brush roller after every nap.Since my daughter is so fond of Miss Dottie, she is a permanent fixture in our house - we can't send her back. But, the mess is driving my husband and I crazy! The manufacturer should be advised about this problem so that they can correct it in the future."
3,Dropping acid with Grandpa,"I don't really understand MMW's fascination with Scofield. I'm guessing that it has to be their roots of influence in traditional jazz. I wish that they could have chosen Grant Green, but the results would've probably been the same honestly. A trio is something special I think, a heart, lung, and brains, go. Add some other organ to that and I think/feel that you waste something, sort of wait around. That's it, the spontaneity is lessened. Not gone, but definitely slowed down some.I unfortunately need to take back everything that I have just said upon hearing ""Julia"". That is beautiful.I love these guys, and always will, so I guess that if they want to play quartet from time to time, I'll just buy it.But, I'd rather the Trio."
3,A bit out there.......,"I'm a fan of Scofield, I like his brand of funk and rhythm, but this album, or at least some of the tunes, are a bit over-funky. Just my opinion."
3,A respectable production.,"I'm an MMW fan who owns three of their previous albums and have seen them perform live. Although Out Louder is a pleasure to listen to, I was a bit disappointed. I always thought MMW could use a guitar in their line up to spice things up a bit, in fact I thoroughly enjoyed Scofield's ""A Go Go"". I guess I expected Out Louder to build on that album, but I think it fell short. I would have liked to hear more standout guitar work. If your a fan, it's worth adding to your collection, if you're not, check it out anyway. It's MMW after all."
4,Took some getting used to,"MMW and Scofield was suggested to me by a very savvy friend. The music took a couple of listens to sink in, but yes I'm liking them more and more.I skip ""Miles Behind"". It's jam-based and I think it's one of those cases where 'you had to have been there.' Otherwise, the rest is very listenable jazz fusion and worth the time.Rebecca Kyle, May 2009"
4,"Real, Suspense, and Drama","In The Wages of Sin, by Dr. Audrey Forrest Carter, I connected with the characters because they seem real enough to just spring from the pages. I felt as if I were an invisible person in the story going along with them in their lives. From the very first chapter till the last, I was on edge of my seat. It seemed as if every time I tried to find a good place to take a break, something else happened to make me want to keep going. I would definitely recommend this book to someone who loves drama and suspense. It will surely keep them entertained. I sure was."
5,Awesome Read!!!,"""The Wages of Sin"" is an awesome read. The book captured my attention from the inception of the book until the end. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a ""great"" read. My hope, is that the author will write a sequel to this book."
4,"""The Wages of Sin"" Captivates","The dramatic novel, ""The Wages of Sin,"" by Dr. Audrey Forrest-Carter, quells the hunger of all readers who crave a bit of spice in their reads!!!! This compact book is a page-turner with powerful messages of fidelity, love, friendship, and one's commitment to God.I loved the book! It really captured my attention and still won't allow my curiosity to cease!!!! Basically, I am eagerly awaiting the sequal."
4,Great Read,Dr. Forrest-Carter has managed to create charecters that everyone can relate to. From Robert to his wife Regina all in the book have something to hide. If you are looking for a fast paced and great read this is the book for you. Keep a look out for the next book from Dr. Forrest-Carter.
4,Sinful Pleasure to Read,"The plot is based around a whirlwind of trials and tribulations the characters face as seen through the sophisticated, but jilted Laura, who struggles with her past while the future seems just as hopeless. The Wages of Sin offers a story of intrigue and scandal at its best. This sinfully delightful book can be appreciated by any and all readers desiring unadulterated entertainment with its fast-paced story of deception and reality. I would highly recommend this novel by first-time author Audrey Forrest-Carter."
2,The Wages of Sin is Death...,"Author Audrey Forrest Carter penned a book with a very catchy title, ""The Wages of Sin,"" one that grabs the attention of the reader immediately. Through the first person voice of the main character, Laura Bradley-Hutchins, the reader is taken on a short but not very informative journey of Laura's life.Although the storyline is good, Carter never fleshes out the characters, and the read was too fast to get a grasp of a true time line. Carter does not create scenes that give the reader a visual of the setting or character features. However, Carter did an excellent job of displaying the temperament and spirit of her characters.I would recommend this quick read at 137 pages. Overall, I enjoyed ""The Wages of Sin""; and as we are reminded in the the Bible, it is death.Reviewed by Sharel E. Gordon-LoveAPOOO BookClub"
3,The wages of sin burns up the beach!,"""The Wages of Sin"" by Dr. Audrey Forrest-Carter is a drama filled page turner! With believeable characters like Laura Hutchins, and rel life situation we can all relate to, The Wages of Sin is sure to catch you in its web from the very beginning. Its paperback cover and shorter length make it the perfect beach read for the coming summer months. It is sure to make your vacation unforgettable!"
2,If you like sim audit you&#65533;ll love Port Royal,"I was hoping to do a little pirating, but instead found myself muddled in finances. When you can't get through the tutorial without confusion its not good."
1,Silly Intro to Every Other Song!,"I liked all of the actual songs, buuuuutt there is a silly intro to every other song throughout the entire album!! I wouldn't recommend this cd/album. Get one with less songs but without a childrens book story-telling intro to each song.The intro's ruined the album!The intro's ruined the album!The intro's ruined the album!The intro's ruined the album!"
5,Excellent resource for digital crime scene investigations,"I am a computer security instructor by trade, and I constantly make reference to Mr. Vacca's books during ethical hacking, countermeasures, and digital forensics classes.Mr. Vacca has a very unique talent for examining the potential scenarios that a forensic investigator might encounter, each of which are described from a different vantage point and role; in addition, his grasp of regulatory compliance is very helpful to system auditors and penetration testing professionals alike.This book is also very valuable from a policy creation and enforcement standpoint. The author provides many scenarios, both hypothetical and real life, that can be used to formulate and maintain effective security policies for information assurance and related audit tasks."
5,Must read for I/T professionals,"The reporting of economic and cyber crime continues to be problematic and grossly underestimated. The data reported in this excellent book proves that intellectual property theft and security breaches are sky rocketing. Author John Vacca does it again to produce another outstanding technology book on computer forensics. Deep seated in computer security aspects, this book provides complete coverage of this new sector of computer management and administration. The book's organization is structured to thoroughly cover the basics, evidence manipulation, analysis of data, and a particularly fascinating section on information warfare which provides frightening insight into both domestic and global issues which are here today. Mr. Vacca's extensive background in government and commercial security greatly enhances the readabilitly of this book. A must read for all I/T professionals including CIOs, system administrators, security specialists, and business managers."
1,Disappointed by the content,"When I started this book I figured it would be on forensic analysis, data recovery and court presentation. The subject matter, however, tends to be more in tune with scare tactics, information warfare and a review of the author's previous work. The cd of ""forensic software"" doesn't match the content either. Several of the packages on the cd are interesting, useful and even well known, however the book doesn't go into detail regarding their use. In my opinion, I would recommend the book by Heiser and Kruse as a better choice for those looking for a complete book on the subject of computer forensics."
1,Little or nothing for the practitioner or serious student,"Vacca appears to have edited rather than written this, and none too well at that. Some chapters use British spelling and some US, some talk of Pounds Sterling and others Dollars. (For each of the five star reviews, examine that writer's other reviews see if you detect a pattern emerging.)Having said that, the book does present a fairly decent overview of computer forensics for those who want general information about it, and had it been advertised as such I'd have graded it higher. It offers little or nothing, however, to the practitioner or serious student."
1,"Another ""How to..."" disappointment.","Computer Forensics: Computer Crime Scene Investigation (With CD-ROM)by John R. Vacca.This book is a real disappointment. It is pedantic, has low technical content, 90% palaver, and lots of anecdotal stories of little practical use. Amazon should be ashamed of recommending it."
2,????,"this is NOT a hands on tech book. it has a lot of procedure that is important for insuring the intergity of information that is gathered but i was expecting the ""meat"" of the subject."
2,"""pull the plug""",The vacuum's switch does not work. The only way to turn off the machine is by pulling the plug. This is not what I thought I was purchasing when I bought a brand name vacuum.
2,Vacuum review,Good vac but capacity seems small for a commercial unit. Plastic clips that hold cannister in place seem likely to break. Would not have purchased this model if I saw it in person. Relied on other Amazon reviews for information.
2,Looks nothing like the angel pictured...,"The item I received looked nothing like the one in the picture, but it was so close to the day that I needed it I had to use this one. Not pleased--I do not recommend this item."
4,rims only,"mom got me these as a b-day gift. they didn't cost too much but they look fantastic. i love them. the problem was that she ordered rims and got only rims...no spacers, nuts, or valves. good thing Discount Tire has all of that otherwise they'd still be sitting in the boxes and not on my car. they are pretty shiny too."
4,Good Underground CD,This cd is a pretty good collection of underground tracks.My favorite tracks are:-F* What You Heard-Da Summa Remix-Smokin' On Da Dro (The Hook with Pimp C is TIGHT)-Grab Tha Gauge-Lockdown-Jealous Azz B*-Pass That Junt-Make A Stang (Deep Bass)-Sleep-MidstateI recommend this cd to anybody. You can bump this cd real loud with the deep bass. Go pick it up.
4,The Chapter 2 world domination of the underground cd's,"This is a 4 and a half cd. It is not completely underground cd. Some songs are newer. Sleep is one of the best rap songs I have ever heard. I is hauntingly beautiful especially the chorus that woman singing is a surprise. She sounds ghosty. Grab the gage is the second best song. It is hard as hell. Fo da summa rexix is tight so is powder, there ode to blow. Most songs are good I won't name them all. This good cd to pick up if you want to know what 3 6 sounded like when they where the triple 6 mafia. Solid release wish they still sounded like this, but ow well. Also pick up THE KAZE another tight prophet entertainment release. Peace."
2,Needs more consistency,"As far as production is concerned, this is the best of the Triple Six Mafia underground releases, for the sole purpose that some of the tracks (not all of them) are up to par with the rest of the industry. There are three or four that sound like they were recorded in the basement, and they don't fit in at all. However, the album is worth buying just for ""Da Summa (Remix),"" ""Smokin On Da Dro,"" ""Sleep,"" and ""Lock Down."" If you're not a huge Three 6 Mafia fan, save your $."
2,Its stright!,"Well fans of 3-6 mafia, I wouldnt buy this. All of their stuff sounds good except the triple six mafia albums and the underground albums. Stick to the Gansta Boo's and Project Pat's ignore the Koopsta Knicca and the rest of the underground."
2,Good data but Catholic basher,"As a frequent traveler to Mexico over the last 25 years, I enjoyed a lot of the explanations in the book, but found the ever-constant references to the Catholic church as being the root of Mexico's problems more than a bit overdone."
3,useful but biased,A useful review of traditional Mexican cultural concepts marred by an anti-Spanish and anti-clerical bias
1,Equal opportunity loathing,"This book is more than 10 years old -- and perhaps things in Mexico have changed dramatically recently. I'm an expat living in Mexico and I don't find the people here anything like the extraordinarily negative portrayal in this book. I'm also sure many of the Catholic priests and the Spanish people were awful. But I can't believe absolutely every single one of them was from the pit of hell -- as is repeated on what feels like every other page. Here's an example: ""Most Mexicans have a built-in victim mentality which is a product of more than four centuries of physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual abuse."" The author clearly despises both the Mexicans and their oppressors. I felt a little beaten up just reading this book."
2,A LOT of generalizations & repetitive,"As others have said, this book contains many broad generalizations and repeats itself many times. Instead of having one section on gender, machismo, and sex, they had about 25 various similar sections with the same idea: Men want to impregnate as many women as possible (including others' wives) and women should hate sex (or they're sluts). Wow.I tried to learn more about the author (to see their sources and experiences with Mexico), but came up with very little information."
4,Excellent insights...,"Succinct. Each vocabulary word is a core cultural value or traditional feature in Mexico. It is explained and put into context in one or two pages. These are interesting and functional for understanding and getting along in Mexico. The only quibbles are that so many topics end in a pep talk on how to use the information in business negotiation. That pattern got a little old. As everywhere, travel, education, and media have blurred some of these traditional traits somewhat-sometimes-for some people. That said, knowing these concepts will still help tremendously. Learn, anticipate, observe/compare, and adjust."
4,Careful!,"The content if fine, BUT it is identical to""NTC's Dictionary of Mexican Cultural Code Words"";they didn't even bother to change the title page,they just slapped a new paper cover on it. Asinteresting as the book may be, I certainly didn'tneed two copies!"
2,Deceptive Title,"It is a good book - great, in fact.However, the book shares both title and ISBN# (it's the same book!!!!) as: ""NTC's Dictionary of Mexican Cultural Code Words : The Complete Guide to Key Words That Express How the Mexicans Think, Communicate, and Behave"". This was especially frustrating when I purchased both books as a special offer through Amazon.I contacted the publisher and Amazon both, but did not receive a satisfactory answer (ie; they will continue to sell the same book with a different title and cover only). Fortunately, Amazon WILL give you your money back if you return it!"
2,poor random design,"I've had this disc for 10 years. I recently noticed that the Microsoft version of Klondike called Solitaire has a poor random deal generator. I spotted repeating patterns after playing a few dozen games. So I dug out my Ultimate Solitaire by Valusoft and began playing Klondike. Within a few dozen games I again spotted repeating patterns. I am guessing but I think both Microsoft and Valusoft use a random number generator in the operating system and either neither of them know how to increase the randomness or neither company knows how to write its own random number generator. I suspect that all of Valusoft's solitaire games use the same random number generator, thus all of the games suffer from the same lack of random shuffles of the cards. The games are fun but don't expect the shuffles to ""always"" give you a different game. But there are a lot of games and it will take you a long time to try them all.Hue"
5,Catfisherman's dream,"Being a long time Zebco user and fan ,I bought this item a little leary about the rod. But was greatly please when I hit the river with them. Not only did it handle the strong current, it handled this different sized fish with ease . I would recommend this combo for any lake or river fisherman."
1,tackle box missing,I just get the box from fedex.But there are only rod and reel in the box.The tackle box can not be find.But it should be in the box according to the announcement of the website.
3,Decent,"This Rod and Reel combo is a good starter, the rod is good, the reel kinda sucks, if you are an experienced fisherman, you will just get dissapointed, but you can always purchase a good reel and swap it out."
1,not happy at all,i search for saltwater reels and this thing shows up with it... and i bought it and it is for fresh water only!!!!!!!!!!!!! waste of my money
1,zebco combo,"when i got this rod, it felt really sturdy. after using it on ONE light pier fishing trip, the reel broke. When i shake the reel, i can hear a piece of plastic shaking around inside. I took off the reel and bought another one to use with the rod."
2,scratches floors,"I was pleased with the way the Hoover cleaned my floors, except that I had to empty the containers too many times. After using it for 3 or 4 weeks, I realized that it is scratching and scuffing the floors and they look terrible. I hope I can return it because I can no longer use it. Terry Sita"
4,thought there was only one model,i too didn't realize there were diff.models [i researched it on the web] but saw it at brandsmart and thought i was getting a good buy. its not the magic bullet for tile but saves the mopping.who knew there were supposed to be spinning brushes?a little truth in advertising? problem is finding lysol concentrate for machine.is there somehing else to use?
4,Hoover Floormate,I really like this but I wish I'd spent a little more & opted for the rotating brushes & gotten the one w/attachments to get into tight spaces. This doesn't fit around my toilet bowls. Now I've got to get down on my hands & knees to scrub around them. I bought the machine to avoid this but the price was great & it does a really nice job on the tiles & laminate flooring.
3,H2800,"My wife and I have been using is product for over 1yr on Pergo, Hardwood and the ceramic tile in our bathrooms. The stationary brushes work best on the Pergo & Hardwood since the surfaces are completely flat without any deep groves or grain. You will have to go over dried food and scuff marks a couple of times to remove. It leaves some water behind on the tile floor but performance here is still good. The rubber squeegee has worn after a year of weekly use and the water suction has been diminished by at least 60%. The replacement part is $17 and on a six week delivery time. The filter and suction pathway needs to be cleaner consistently to maintain proper removal of the water. At times you may need to stop and restart the machine to regain suction. Throw your mop out! 3 stars for performance and value."
1,U-SCRUB,I WOULD RATE THIS ITEM -0- STAR BUT IT IS NOT AN OPTION.THERE ARE TOO MANY STYLES/MODELS. IT IS VERY CONFUSING. CHECK ITEM SPECIFICS CAREFULLY TO AVOID GETTING THE WRONG STYLE/MODEL.THIS VACUUM HAS STATIONARY BRUSHES. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND PAY THE DIFFERENCE FOR THE MODELS W/ SPIN-SCRUB.
2,Better than mopping,"It's better than mopping. But that's all. It puts down solution and picks it up. Other than that it's just like mopping.My suggestion is, get a better model."
4,One of Mulligan's best albums,"This is a must have album for cool jazz lovers. Smooth, calm, warm tunes of Mulligan are accompanied by the vibraphone virtuoso, Lionel Hampton. Performances of Mulligan and Hampton are great. What you'll hear is a heartwarming music with very well balanced solos of each player. Almost all tracks include trade of eights between saxophone, vibraphone, piano, bass, guitar and drums. Maybe this album won't make your heart beat faster, or drawn you in tears, but you will enjoy it for sure."
5,Learning to Soar,"Forever...forever...Those are Eaglet's thoughts from the time he describes being inside his egg all the way through his soaring flights. What a wonderful story! Beautiful illustrations help the young reader ""see"" how the bird looks inside an egg, how the nest becomes too small for everyone, how the eaglet's feathers fluff up in the wind, and how the world might look from an eagle's view. Stunning!Eaglet describes many of life's lessons. He wishes each comfortable step of his life would stay the same forever. Then he realizes his life needs to change and he finds out the next step is wonderful too. The lessons ring true for everyone and are explained clearly even to a younger reader. This is a book to be read on many different levels and is worth every one of them."
5,At last I found it!,"This whole CD is absolutely wonderful. The Eastern timbred melodies are so hauntingly beautiful that they strike the very core of one's being. ""Love Theme from Spartacus"" is one of my all time favorite Jazz recordings ever, and I was so pleased to find it on this CD after searching for over 20 years in record stores around the world. Everyone should have this CD in their collection, if only to listen to that one song over and over and over and over again!"
4,Good Book for Novice and Intermediate Coaches,"I have played soccer competitively most of my life (38 years) and have made the transition from player to coach. I currently hold a ""National D Level License"" from the US Soccer Federation and coach 13-14 year olds. This is one of the texts that was provided to me during my coaching course. It has been helpful with age appropriate activities. Unlike the previous reviewer who is obviously youthful in his opinions and seems to have a personal problem with the author, I have found this text to be helpful. I figure if the US National Youth System backs the author then he is qualified regardless of his personna or ability to make every player happy."
1,"Never buy a book by Roy Rees, EVER. Why? Keep reading","I'm a player in the Tulsa Thunder, a well known competitive club in the area. I get hands on training and coaching with Roy Rees. I'll make this short and sweet, the man is stupid with soccer tactics. The practices he conducts are dumb.His tactics are stupid.If you are a coach, and lookin for a book on how to coach,do not, I REPEAT, do not buy a coaching book wrote by Roy. This is coming from a players point of view. Because if you coach like Roy, and act like Roy, people will hate you.If you want some examples of how Roy pisses me off, write me an E-mail and I'll tell you I dont care if anyone from the club is reading this either"
4,i just plain like it,I have seen the movies and I really like the music. Especially courageous attack. I would buy it if it becomes available.
5,Far from the tree is excellent,I listen to books due to poor sight. This book kept me interested all the way through. It started a little slow but just kept getting better. I would highly recommend I.
4,The Complete Monterey Pop Festival,"The DVD Disc case said 3 discs, was advertised as a 2 disc set. Disc # 1 had 7 good tunes, Disc # 2 had 4 good tunes, OK for the price if you like Simon & Garfunkel, the Byrds, Jefferson Airplane, The Mammas & The Papas.Overall, OK"
5,YES!,"This is the album to buy if you want GOOD QUALITY Spooky Kids sound! Period. Every song is great. It really shows how Manson evolved in his music...from this to Golden Age of Grotesque, evolved is the only word that fits. I can only complain about the DVD. It claims to have ""raw"" footage, but it is very obvious that the video itself is the only raw part, while the audio is obviously the studio track being dubbed over the video. Forgivable, though, because the songs on the CD are so good. BUY THIS ALBUM"

ThriftDetailsDistributor: BMGRecording Type: StudioRecording Mode: StereoSPAR Code: n/aAlbum NotesLUNCH BOXES & CHOKLIT COWS features unreleased demos that originally appeared as bootlegs in the early nineties.Includes a bonus DVD.The Spooky Kids: Marilyn Manson (vocals); Daisy Berkowitz (guitar); Madonna Wayne Gacy (keyboards); Gidget Gein (bass); Sara Lee Lucas (drums).
3,hm...,"if you were one of the lucky few to get all the songs for free from SMP himself (like i was).. then don't bother to get this. in fact, the songs on this cd are in the same order as disc 1 of the promo! all the songs are identical with almost all of them having the same track length!all that aside, i still love these songs and if you are only a fan of some of the manson stuff, i wouldn't recommend this."
1,CHEESY HOMEMADE DISCS,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! What junk! I don't know how these people get away with selling these homemade bootlegs but this should be against the law. This set doesn't even have a record company or production label. The packaging is some cheap CD jewel case that doesnt even hold the discs in place, and the CDs are labeled with the kind of label you buy to print at home...the quality is worse, it sounds like someone recorded it from the audience. You hear glasses clinking and people talking. There is a bonus DVD that shows video taken by a cell phone (or taken from You Tube)and is such poor quality sound and video that even the worst YouTube video beats it by a mile. Whats really funny is that it is video and audio of MM during the ""lunchbox"" era and the few short interviews on the DVD are from the Golden Age of Grotesque era. There is nothing on these discs that is ""rare"" or ""unseen"" and I have seen all of this on YouTube...a total waste of money!!!!!"
2,Don't Expect Much and You'll Be Happy,"As a fan of Marilyn Manson, since Portrait of an American Family. I expected this album to be be somewhat similar to that earlier work.However, I was unhappily surprized.The lyrics don't flow with the beats. It is not b/c the beats sound horrible though or so strange that the album is unlistenable. I actually liked the beats more than the heavily manufactured sound that Manson has now (But read the last paragraph of this.)Also, you can find better/different sounding versions of these songs (such as ""White Knuckles"")on old bootlegs.Sorry, I wish I could give this album a better review.However, if you consider yourself the most diehard Manson fan ever, you should buy it (I guess). If you are that person - you probably should just buy it; and you'll probably like it, just b/c - no matter how it sounds."
1,No way!,"I love Marilyn Manson but this is a bad recording and most of these songs are lame. No nearly as good as Manson's professional debut ""Portrait Of An American Family"". This album is lame with a capital L. Keep in mind that this album was before Manson got sighned to a major record label."
5,Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids,"Wow... If you are a True... TRUE MANSON FAN... This is a must have... Gidget Gein, RIP man\m/... If you want to see early, and listen to early, Manson... the evolution of himself and band... You NEED this...TLedDaHead"
3,Only for the fans,"Lets say in an unrealistic world you've never heard of Marilyn Manson.You can't think of one song they've done.Then this is not the album to introduce you to the band.I've been listening to Marilyn Manson since '94 and when this was re-released I was all over it.It's definitely an addition to my collection, but isn't something that I would purchase if I weren't a fan and a collector."
3,works with the cleanser,"Since i use a topical gel (prescription) to control acne, my skin gets so dry and flaky and in the morning it used to take me 30 mins just to get the dead skin off my face. Usually this made my skin really irritated. But i had to do it because dead skin leads to breakouts and it looks really strange. This device with the included cleanser removed it super fast and painlessly, however, when I switched to other cleansers it did not seem to work as well. The clairsonic cleanser is hardly natural. It's got alot of things in it that sound too 'chemical facotry' to me. I may actually return it, if i just can't make it remove my dead skin without the cleanser. THis model also only came with a coupon for ONE skin brush, not two as I was told."
5,A no-hype product,"I researched these a few months ago, but was skeptical. When my dermatologist recommended it for my sun damaged skin, I ordered it. I've been using it two times/day for a month and I have to say, the hyper-pigmentation is definitely fading. My pores are smaller and I think the dark circles under my eyes look better. I think another two months will see even more improvement.I use the brush on my eyelids. A side benefit is my dry eye problem, due to lack of oily part of tear fluid, has dramatically improved...go figure. Had I known this I would have ordered it years ago."
3,Be carefeful which product you purchase,"Be careful which Clarisonic product your purchase. Look for the Clarisonic MD, which is the newest/latest model. Some vendors, like Sephora, are still selling the old model (with less features) at the same price. With the MD model, you get three speeds and three brushes.I know this because some friends gave me a $200.00 gift certificate to buy the Clarisonic brush from Sephora. When I attempted to purchase the item from Sephora, in the store and on the Internet, I realized Sephora was only selling the older model. Talk about frustrated B-day gift purpose, this was in February of this year and Sephora still has not updated its stock."
5,"Great for skin, will NOT cure problem area skin","This was recommended to me at a spa, I politely passed. Thought it over for a couple of months and bought it for myself for my b'day. I really like it. Be careful to not ""overbuff"" in some areas or a shine might develop. This is great for the shoulders and back. This is well made, I made sure to buy one with a charger. Being able to use this in the shower is wonderful. I recommend it. It is as loud as my Braun toothbrush. As others have said any cleaser is fine. It does not clear up acne but it certainly allows a healthy glow of skin to be seen. The feeling is nice smooth skin... I think certainly worth it. Just don't expect miracles, simply a well constructed tool to help your skin."
1,It made my skin worse!,"I was very excited to use the Clarisonic Pro to remove my daily makeup. The instructions say that it can be used daily. I used it almost daily for about 5 days (I skipped a few days) but then I noticed that I started to break out all over my face in areas I normally don't have problems with. It actually became quite severe which caused me some distress. Once I realized what had happened, I immediately stopped using it. Would I have to go through a bad phase first to achieve the benefit? I will not know as I have no desire to re-challenge the product. I am very disappointed that it did not work out for me.My husband, on the other hand, uses it quite frequently and hasn't had the break out issues as I have had. He feels as if his face is cleaner. We are fortunate that he can use it. If I had purchased it just for me, it would have been a waste of money."
4,Clarisonic Review,"I have had this item for three months now. I noticed a difference immediately after using it. It thoroughly cleans the skin; leaving it ""squeaky"" clean. My skin feels smooth after each use. I use it on my neck also and experienced the same results. I am very satisfied with this product."
3,Get a Buf Puf instead,"I love my Sonic Care toothbrush (in fact we recommend them at the dental office I work at because we've seen such great results in our patients) so I thought I'd give this a try. The skin care brush is definitely fun to use, but didn't deliver any noticable changes to my 38 year old face. I was so disappointed. A Buf Puf would give you the same results."
1,Be Careful,"Please be careful, my skin broke out from this machine. I had to go to the doctor to handle the acne. I am not a teenager and cannot believe I broke out with acne at my age."
2,"Hmmm, Don't understand the hype? Is it because of Oprah?",I really don't understand what the big deal is about the Skin Care System. I ordered this at the beginning of the year after I couldnt find any Exfoliating pads at any of my local stores. It cleans and feels neat but I dont notice a difference. I recently went to target and again I was reunited with my lovely exfoliating pads. I can tell they work alot better and only cost me $5 a pack. I think everyone jumped on the band wagon because Oprah made it one of her favorite things.
1,Never recieved item,"I would love to coment on this product, but I never recieved it. The delivery estimate was last week, and so I wrote customer service at DERMAdocter, and they said it would come by mid January! Thanks for telling me. I will order somewhere else."
1,hard to communicate with seller,"I haven't received my order, even though my order statue indicate as delivered. It's weird. The USPS person didn't leave a call tag or anything. I've also tried calling USPS with my tracking number, but they couldn't find any record about my order. I've sent several emails about this to the seller, but I never received any response. How can I rate this item when I never recieved my order?"
3,Dangerous Masquerade by Janet Dailey,"Description from the book back cover:Can love be built on deception? LaRaine Evans - spoiled, capricious and used to getting her own way - naturally assumes that her cousin Laurie will satisfy her every selfish whim. So she entreats Laurie to masquerade as herself for the benefit of her fiance's aunt. Meanwhile, LaRaine will be off fulfilling her longlong dream of acting in a movie. Reluctantly, Laurie agrees to the scheme, more out of duty to LaRaine's parents than out of loyalty to her flightly cousin. But neither Laurie nor LaRaine expects Rian Montgomery, the fiance in question, to pay an unexpected visit to his aunt, and to find Laurie playing a dangerous masquerade. And certainly neither one of the cousins anticipates Rian's response to the situation!"
1,not giant,"This toy is not ""Giant"" it is about 11"" long, and it is stretchy and sticky. Also I ordered it because it was orange, and the one I got is purple. None of these things were in the product description."
1,THIS ALBUM IZ FULL OF IT!!!,"DIS ALBUM IZ NOT A ALBUM, IT IZ DA WORSEST TIHS I HAVE EVER HEARD OF!I DONT NO WHERE IN DA HELL THESE IST HEADS CAME FROM!DONT BUY DIS TIHS!!!"
3,I'm glad they offered this product,"I don't have the rechargeable trimmer for which I bought this battery any longer; the battery died after about 6-9 months of use. The first batter in the trimmer lasted about 2-3 years, but each time, the batteries didn't hold their charges very long - perhaps 2-3 weeks at most. I'm glad that Wahl offered this product, but they should consider updating their battery chemistry."
4,Wahl Clipper Battery,"As I found in other reviews, I had noticed the performance of my clipper dropping. I attributed it to age at first. Decided to try a new battery, and am very pleased with the difference. Glad that I purchased a new battery from this vendor. No hassles - quick and easy and my clipper is good again."
1,Wrong battery sent for clipper,"Send me a wrong product as it is 1 cm shorter then the original, so not useful at all.I thought i chose the correct clipper, anyway hv to go buy a new clipper"
5,"Grreat New Product, I highly recommend it for parenting","Your product listing failed to showcase the five key elements of this wonderful Parent Kit which contains: 144 page parent guide book for birth to 12 months old; 32 page toy buying guide; soft-covered baby photo rhyming book complete with 8 fun-filled rhyming cards; 20 track Music CD featuring World & Classical music. All of these fab items inside one package is a great value and an even better single-source resource for parents, grandparents and gift-givers alike.I purchased two parent kits ""Baby Brain Basics Parent Kit: Birth to 12 Months"" for maternity gifts and the expectant mothers to be Loved it!"
5,5 stars,If you can afford these then you are buying the best. try them and see the results for yourself. 1 30 day supply is all you will need to see a major improvement.
3,Not a suitable replacement.....,"I purchased these speakers to replace one door speaker that started to sound bad in my SUV. Needless to say after installing this I was almost ready to re-install my factory one. The speaker looks nice, but the sound is hampered by a rattle that the speaker gives off when any ""real power"" is applied. The sound is quite annoying to me."
1,Sorry I bought it.,"I have to echo a previous review. I don't like to use the self-propelled feature, because it just doesn't feel like it's doing the job. Yet, the switch is on the handle, and I have to hold my thumb on the switch to keep it from engaging, which it always does--annoying.Also, the vacuum does not stay upright. Usually you need to push a pedal to lower from storage to vacuum position. Well, it always falls out of storage position.The suction is okay, but not nearly as good as the Hoover I had previously.Better to spend a little more money on a better vacuum."
2,DONT make my mistake,I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS PURCHASE!!! Suction on this cleaner is extremely poor after just a few minutes of use..Cant turn off brush when using attachments.Plastic latch and other parts break easily..wise to consider another product
1,Money thrown away,This has been the worst vac ever used. It puts out more dirt than it picks up. No power in hose when in use. The filters are always full and difficult to empty. Very expensive annual replacement for the filters and HEPA. So bad I will never purchase another Eureka. I would not give any rating if that was an option.
3,Non sold on bagless,"This is an okay vacuum cleaner, but there are some design flaws. I'm now wary about bagless ones 'cause they are messy and if you don't close them properly dust can leak and spray everywhere. Also when cleaning area rugs with the admustment on high, the cleaner still grabs the edges of rugs and as shredded some. I have to make sure I avoid them and then take out the hose manually in order to clean the edges of the rugs. There must be better designed vacuums for the price."
1,Historic interest only,"This book given a good introduction to historical design methods used for constructing offshore pipelines, while the industry still was new.Modern pipeline designers need to look elsewhere for information on up to data e.g. limit state design."
5,Quincy V.S. Paige: round one,"I started reading FOXTROT to relieve myself of the awful day ofSeptember 11th. I didn't think it would be that funny, but whenI read it, I laughed sooooooo hard I almost couldn't breath!FOXTROT, without question, is one of the 2 funniest comics ofall time! I think CALVIN AND HOBBES and FOXTROT are a tie as thebest strips I've ever read! I own all the books!If you're in the mood for some great laughs, read FOXTROT!"
5,"Thorough, interesting, and well organized","OWL is a complicated language, no doubt about it. It uses layers upon layers upon layers to provide a way to describe ""things"" with all of the complexity that they have in ""real life"". Explaining a system this complicated can be difficult. I know; I do it for a living, myself. But Lee Lacy has managed to break OWL down into small enough pieces that you can begin to see how everything fits together. Kudos for a job well done!"
2,Not a good intro,"I purchased this book hoping to get an understanding of OWL. However,the book is more of a technical manual - describing the syntax andhow different parts of the language fit together. The book doesn'treally give you a sense of why OWL would be useful or provide anygood examples of its use.Perhaps if I were already well versed in OWL this book wouldhave been more useful."
4,Owl's wisdom,"It's a good book, that gives a general overview of semantic web complexities. For people involved it is almost mandatory. As an introduction we would need an user friendly version, with less ""syntactical info"" and more content oriented and application oriented.As a technical concern I would be cautious about a ""layered"" approach to the Semantic Web, instead of a strict layered approach ( remember OSI data communications) I would go to more loosened approach ( remember TCP-IP). But , as a wrap up, it is a very good book. I recommend it."
3,A slight upgrade over the old mattress,"Don't get me wrong...this mattress seems more comfortable to me than my old spring-coil mattress. However, after having slept in a hotel with a Tempurpedic mattress, this one doesn't quite stand up to a comparison. It is much, much cheaper and does offer a pretty comfortable nights sleep. However, it doesn't really sink as much as the ""real deal"" does. It feels more like a very thick foam egg crate...without all the knobs. I don't wake up with AS MANY aches but I occasionally wake up with a stiff back. I had hoped this mattress would be a cheap way of simulating the amazing sleep I had on the really expensive Tempurpedic...not quite, I'm afraid...but a valiant effort.Also, assembling the mattress was a bit strange, but not hard once I got over my fear of ripping the mattress layers accidentally."
5,Awesome!,"Books aren't always going to give people insight or truly cover the scope of their feelings, but no matter what your first inclination towards this book is, it will present some things that may even give you a hint of new insight or a new way of looking at things. What Rogers describes becomes almost a ""mystical"" sensation, one of the few life affirming attitudes that help us rule out logical paradigms and be comfortable with our feelings."
5,GREAT READ!!,I have now read over 100 time travel books and this is one of my favorites. I am on line now looking to see if she wrote anymore.
5,As You Wish (Time Passages),"What's not to love. I love Time Travel books and this book was in great condition, a great price and shipped pronto.Thank you!Nancy"
2,disappointing,I'm sorry to have to disagree with the other reviews. I am an avid reader and enjoy most time travel romances. However I found this book to be boring without much character development.I found it difficult to believe their romance and actually had difficulty finishing the book. I'm sorry to say I won't be looking for this author's name again.
2,Horrible,"What can I say. This book was just horrible. I felt like a child wrote it,I think I read about 25% and could stand no more."
4,A slow read but packed with information.Fascinating.,"I'm usually a pretty fast reader. This book, however was an exception. I found myself fighting to plow ahead in parts and had to re-read many others. Very logically laid out and interesting. Despite it's difficulty, I loved it."
5,Page 273 - more than prophetic,"Acquiring a copy of this book after Sept. 11, 2001 was EXTREMELY difficult, but I got one and read it straight through. Chilling is page 273 and its clairvoyant description of what happened in New York. Even more disturbing is what could happen after.What I like most is that this book is NOT some silly psychic prediction of the future (e.g. the inaccurate and some times completely wrong Nostradamus.) - it just observes trends in history, categorizes them, then postulates what might happen based on this ""loop"" we seem to be in.In the same vein would be Frank Miller's `Give Me Liberty' graphic novel - another vivid portrayal of a ""fourth turning"" scenario.Read `The Fourth Turning' for yourself, if you can find a copy."
2,The Fourth Turning: An American Prophecy,"The Fourth Turning: An American ProphecyI found the book too academic to be of any practical value. Although its thesis is interesting, its application seems forced, even sophomoric. Also, the authors seem to have an overenthusiastic regard for Hillary Clinton. The book is outdated and has less impact than the authors may have wanted. We have been through this ""the sky is falling"" scenario in may other ways, many times before. Its suggestions for surviving the crisis seem like material for fortune cookies or tabloid zodiac advice. Still worth reading-it has some merit, pointing out patterns and interesting ideas.The Fourth Turning: An American Prophecy"
2,Too Boring...,"This book was sent to me by my mother. I have enjoyed books with similar conclusions, namely ""Generation X"" - Douglas Coupland, ""Deflation"" - by Gary Shilling, ""The Great Reckoning"" - Davidson & Rees-Mogg. Most of this book is a hand-wavy rehash of the last 200 years of American History. It cannot hold a candle (and it cannot hold my interest) compared to these other titles. There are no academic references for the historic interpretations that are drawn. Because there are least 300 value judgements made about historic periods of American History, I'd say that this book verges on being ""Intellectual Trash.""For me, the book said that my life would kinda suck, but to take comfort because the next generation after me will have a life that _Really Sucks_. No surprise there. Tell me something that I don't already know !!!"
5,The Fourth Turning is the book of the century,"After reading the Fourth Turning, I've come to realize that I am my own great grandpa.Being born in 1982 makes me part of the ""Hero Generation."" We're supposed to save the world every fourth generation. And by we I mean other people my age.Father Time is into numerology. The number he is obsessed with is four. This represents Orafoura. He is the Fourth Turning. He keeps reappearing throughout history. This is haunting.Ghost, spirit, soul, Orafoura. Four names, four directions to the same thing.Orafoura lies in bed on his stomach, with his left leg crossed over his right leg at the knee to form a ""4."" He does this to get back to nature, and get back to sleep.Orafoura set his alarm clock to go off when the defiant shouts of the heroes pushing against the establishment turns to the grunts of exertion that are released as they pull the economy up and up to greater and greater heights than even those seen before December 2007."
1,fascinating straw dog,"they make bold statements and present theory as fact. very intriguing on the surface, but frankly irritating in the lack of scientific process when examined closely. its the ""prophesy"" of their predictions that we are all interested in, i would imagine, and that was sufficiently vague to satisfy all."
1,Junk History/Science,"What a bunch of simplistic, wordy, and mindless gibberish. This kind of ""Junk History"" contributes nothing to the advancement of mankind's journey. It only serves to feed the simplistic and lazy mind to make overdrawn conclusions and in this case this tome tends to lean to the right on the political spectrum. Never has the nation and the world been in such dire need of rational and sound thinking to guide us through this difficult time.Yet, we are now turing(no pun intended) to this kind of junk thinking, simplistic answers from religious zealots and useless polemics from mindless politicians. If our species is to survive and our enlightened culture to progress, we must reject such simplistic models...the thinking minds among us must do the hard work necessary to discover rational solutions to our most perplexing problems. This book does not contribute to this endeavor."
3,Tedious and suspect,"Could have made his point in half the time & pages, and his premise is inconsistent. Would not recommend it."
4,Interesting Theory,"This book is extremely interesting, and I feel its overall points are valid. Still, I can't help the feeling that the details and examples provided have been shoehorned a bit to fit the theory.It does make sense, for example, that children brought up during a Depression will have a different viewpoint throughout their lives than children born in the euphoric period after the end of a world war. However, labeling World War I a mere ""Unraveling"" as opposed to a ""Crisis"".... that I find somewhat hard to accept. It was certainly a crisis throughout Europe....Still, this a great read and provides much food for thought."
3,"Interesting, worth pondering, but a bit of a reach.","This book had a lot of interesting ideas, ones that you could easily debate with friends. At times though, I felt as though the examples that the authors were using to prove their points could have been interchangeable with anything. I believe that anyone could make just as strong an argument that the opposite is the case if they wanted to."
5,This book breaks history into cycles.,This book breaks history into easy to digest cycles. It then extrapolates social responces to major events for about 50 years into the future based upon common reactions in previous cycles.
5,A new look at why history tends to repeat itself.,"The book puts forth a new idea about how history unfolds. Furthmore, it presents real data to support the novel concept that history is not a series of linear events that randomly happen in time. Rather, history tends to be cyclic with surprising similarities recurring."
1,product smells rancid,Either I got a spoiled bottle or their idea of what a fine blended oil (Chinese Vanilla Jasmine) should smell like old cooking oil...ugh!
4,Pretty good Saucisson,"It is very difficult to find a good Saucisson in the US, being French I am always looking for a good one.This one is a pretty good one, even if it does not taste like the real Rosette de Lyon it is one of the best Saucisson I had on this side of the pond.I would recommend it to everybody looking for a good shot of Saucisson. Overnight delivery in an impressive cooled package was perfectly on time.Definitely a good choice."
3,ok,"Product was ok,not exactly as advertised,just ok.Performance I would rate a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10.As for delivery it absolutely sucked.Wasted $20.00 on express delivery and it actually came later.Don't know how that was possible.Not to happy."
4,Covers everything pretty well,I have to disagree with the review that said this book was for beginners. It's certainly not although no study guide is going to touch what your course book has in regards to information. It is very good at hitting all the main points and explaining them in very easy to understand language. It is definetely more in depth then some of the other guides out there. I used this guide a long side my text and class notes and easily got an A in A+P. PLEASE REMEMBER it's JUST A GUIDE. It's like CLIFF NOTES for a textbook. You won't get EVERYTHING FROM A STUDY GUIDE
3,Unacceptable mistakes,"For such a well-acclaimed book, it is frustrating to see authors' poor understanding of chemistry basics. Contrary to what the authors say, the ionic bond is not weaker than the covalent bond, which is proven by the same authors in the very next sentence after the erroneous statement, where they mention higher melting point of NaCl.Page 26 takes it even further. To say that the ""mole"" is a unit of weight may be excusable for a freshman who does not still have a grasp of chemistry basics, but for two full professors... it is nothing less than an unjustifiable blunder, furthermore aggravated by its confusing power due to being uttered by authority of such a rank."
1,Get the other 3 disc edition instead,"This DVD includes only the live concert. Get the other 3 disc edition instead which includes the same live concert, plus a behind the scenes documentary and other extras PLUS a live audio CD of 7 of the live songs!They (the record company) really blew it by not including the extras with this DVD. Instead, they hadto release 2 different packages, this one and the other edition which costs more. That said, this one is a total waste of money and if you are a Depeche Mode fan at all, you would do well to get the special edition instead. Unless you don't want the extras."
1,Do Not Be Confused Mode Fans,"Please do not fall in the same trap as many,this is the dvd only release format.You should buy the 3 disc set listed under AUDIO which contains the 2 dvd full concert plus extras plus audio cd !It is not much more expensive than this version and is the result of a marketing feux paix"
4,if you are a fan you cant go wrong,"ok first off, be prepared... martin l. gore is getting old, and starting to look it. heart breaking.second thing...well they edited it to look a bit like a music video, at first it fealt too over produced to me, but now i hardly notice.a must buy for DM fans"
5,Great quality,"From the outside to the inside it is a great quality dvd. The package was nice and great and there are very nice pictures from the concert!The music quality is amazing as well as the edition. Although it is a different edition format from the other Depeche dvds it is still good. I felt like they wanted us to feel a new Depeche Mode experience, how the fans felt and how did Depeche feel on stage because there are a lot of closeups and special effects. And the best thing, it has the best of the best from Depeche Mode songs it is like feeling the 80s, 90s, and the 2000 period of the group!!! I totally recommend the dvd!"
2,Consigue La Version Especial De Tres Discos,"A todos los fans de DPM, no compren este DVD, hagan una búsqueda de DPM como Music y compren Touring The Angel Live In Milan como CD, este tiene 3 discos:Disco 1: El Concierto(DVD)Disco 2: Documental(DVD)Disco 3: 8 canciones en vivo(CD)Cuesta un poco mas, pero realmente vale la pena"
3,Really moderate,"I'm a depeche mode fan since '87. And I think this is not their finnest hour that in concerts refferalls. I saw few concerts in US and Mexico City and I think the best was Mexico City. Why do not recorder it in this city when you had the chance like U2, Metallica, etc? Just a thought ! But it is a fan concert if you really like DM."
2,Terrible Recording of a Brilliant Performance,"Devotional and One Night in Paris are beautiful and rich documents of Mode's incredible performances.Touring the Angel, unfortunately, is loaded with headache inducing fast cuts, camera distortion and gimicky effects...truly a lost opportunity.I wouldnt even watch the film, just crank up the volume to hear the great music and avert my eyes from the repulsively manipulated and hacked footage of the concert.Bring Anton back for the Tour of the Universe please! Lose this Blue Leech guy who is responsible for this Touring the Angel DVD.Just my honest opinion, no offense meant to those who enjoyed this DVD."
3,I am so disappointed!!,"After watching One Night In Paris dozens of times because it is just like being there, I was so excited to get the latest concert.What a let down this is in editing!! Why all the special effects???Dave and Martin on stage is all we need...not blurred images, and split screens! The show was staged wonderfully but you can't apreciate it due to all the ""enhancements"".When you can actually ""see"" the concert for what it was there are some grat moments....Dave watch Martin from the side on ""Home""....Dave and Martin in the finally of ""Goodnight Lovers""I am so sad they didn't stick with Anton Corbijn. His work lets DM stand on there own with out added effects.I also never would have pre-order this version if I knew the extended version was comming with bonus material.One Night In Paris is the BEST DM concert on film!!!!!"
1,Subtitles? Yeah right!,"Sadly in this day and age it is hard to find music DVD's that have been fully encrypted with subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing so my heart leapt where on the back on this dvd boxset it clearly states 'Subtitles: English...' so I snapped up a copy which arrived today only to find the subtitles are for the documentary only, where are the subtitles for the concert footage please?. My heart dropped. This package is going straight back to Amazon for a refund - shame on you Splinter Films and Mute Records for misleading information."
5,A Welcome and Essential Title,"This is an excellent book, and one that is, in my opinion, essential because of all the titles ""out there"" that claim to present accurate information about the Northern Path, Asatru, the runes, etc., but really don't, at best, cut it. Sweyn's research, his own take on these and other issues, as well as his careful and thorough research make this an accessible book filled with useful information.In addition to True Helm, Plowright's ""Rune Primer"" is also well worth your time and money. The sheer number of titles that claim to present accurate and applicable information about Asatru make this title a first-stop for anyone just getting into the runes or Asatru. I wish I had found ""The Rune Primer"" much sooner than I did.If you had to compose a Top Five list of books on these topics, it would be an easy call to add True Helm.Again, thank you, Sweyn, for writing this book. I hope it finds its way into many hands."
5,Ace of Hearts,"I was totally impressed with the condition of the DVD, and thoroughly enjoyed watching it. It is an excellent video, and I would like to see more similar videos."
1,Based on a true story?,"What part of this was ""based on a true story""? That there was once a cop with a police dog? What's this movie about? A stupid jerk cop with a genius daughter who is able to figure everything out by looking on Wikipedia. This cop lets his dog be put to sleep for biting a guy's throat before checking the stupid security camera that proved he didn't. And why was there a security camera there anyway? It would have been pointed at nothing. And the dumb doctors can't tell between a self inflicted wound and a dog bite? I don't think I need to go on."
5,Piano Jazz played Fast and Furious,"This is an inspired live performance by Peterson, accompanied by just guitar and bass. The opening ""Wheatland"" is terrific - a bullet-train ride through the Midwest, with Peterson playing lightning-fast runs with perfect precision. Antonio Carlos Jobim's ""Wave"" has a more relaxed theme, but Peterson still provides fireworks aplenty. ""For Count"" is another Peterson composition, which he attacks full-tilt. ""The Good Life"" features a more measured tempo and some quieter moments, letting the guitarist carry some of the load, while ""On a Clear Day"" features a terrific guitar solo. Not the most introspective of recordings, but a prime choice for those who like their piano jazz fast and furious."
2,useless,This book is just a short book with some old black and white pictures. I was simply disappointed as it was of no use to me whatsoever.
4,"A different Trey, but still very good music","I've been around the block many times with all of Trey's material, from the old days with Phish to the new days without. With a lot of Phish shows, Phish albums, Trey albums, and general music listening under my belt (I'm now 30) I have to say that this is a very solid piece of work by Trey. After approximately 10 listens, I can give Bar 17 a stamp of quality. Overall, this is a rather sad and slow album. The production isn't quite as chirpy as Shine. However, the music is really very good. Listen to the strings on tunes such as ""Gloomy Sky"" and ""Bar 17"". How can you not tip your hat to Trey? The man may not play guitar like a 25 year old, but he can still compose a tune that is very much Trey, and very much enjoyable."
2,Very scattered-,"Some over the top bad songs. What is the bike song all about? Syd Barrett was cool, and wrote a weird song about a bike. Trey's song about a bike sucks. There are some great moments on this disc, and as always w/ Trey the musicians on the album are top-notch. The downside is, its almost painful waiting to get to them.I enjoyed most of his first album, and parts of Shine. This is easily his 3rd best solo album... Comparing it to Outside In by Mike Gordon, the album really has no flow. Be nice to see Phish get back together, but I'm afraid it would sound an awful lot like this, and that would be very depressing."
3,Shine plus Phish,"This album could be a new Phish album. And that piss me off. Why they are not toguether anymore? Anyway, in ""Shine"" Trey was really simple but cool. In ""bar 17"" Trey is more complex but more free. It's kind of weird if you listen to it carefully. Trey is trying the things he already knew with Phish and the things he learned in his old solo albums. What I'm saying, ""bar 17"" is ""Shine"" plus any phish album in a blender. The result: something new that sounds like something we already heard. But cool enough to worth to listen. Great album. but I insist , if Trey is going to record more albums like this, he should please think about coming back to Phish. I know he miss it."
4,Vet recommended after my dog kept breaking her leg,After my chi/pom cross dog (who is literally ALL legs) broke her FL shoulder once & the wrist on the same leg twice my vet recommended a supplement because of how fragile my dog's legs were. I started putting a teaspoon in wet food once a day for her. She had no problem eating it & her bones seemed to have healed fairly well & there hasnt been a 4th break thankfully. I still supplement it once in a while & recommend it for people & peoples' animals fairly frequently. Not sure if it made a HUGE difference but I believe it definitely made some. Overall im happy with it & have heard many good things about it.
2,Can't rate product,I only tried it once.I can not rate the product because I only tried it one time.Unable to give an opinion because I only tried it one time.
2,Hard to understand,"I found this book to be a hard read. When I purchased this book, I also had to purchase another one for the same class. The other book I purchased presented the same information in an easier to understand vocabulary. The purpose of this book was to introduce educators to doing their own educational research within their peer review audience. It gave the steps you needed to take to examine different issues that you felt were important in your classroom and school that needed to be researched as ""problems."""
4,A Bit Too Much Rhythm,"This album is an excellent example of traditional latin jazz. And Vince Guaraldi fans should note that this is the only Cal Tjader release (besides ""Jazz at the Blackhawk"") to feature Guaraldi exclusively on piano.That said, the percussion on this recording, while certainly lively and energetic, is a bit heavy-handed. As a result, this album can become rather tedious to listen to all the way through - to say nothing of repeated listens. Tjader & Co. should have varied the tempos a bit to avoid tiring the listener."
4,Perfect for the money that is paid,I recently purchased this item for my girlfriend to wear and she loves it. I would recommend this item to any person who is looking to try something new. fast shipping too!!
5,sexy,The material is soft and the body stocking did fit nicely on my woman. I bought it for this Vday weekend and I definitely enjoyed it on her.
3,Okay Clubs,"My son was pretty excited for these clubs, and he still plays with them occasionally, but he broke at least one of the clubs within a week or so. But i imagine you get what you pay for."
1,Brena,"Still have not received Happy Anniversity Charm after 30 days, and guess what? Today is our Anniversity. Will not do buisness with this company again."
4,Teena is great!,"My favorite song on this CD is ""Love Me Down Easy."" Teena sounds amazing on this song!"
3,Teena Fans,"This CD is just okay. I bought it for one specific song that I have wanted forever, ""Love Me Down Easy"". That song is one of my favorite Teena cuts."
1,not right ones,"I told the company what year my machine was (old, but motor works beautifully). These were for the newer version and did not fit."
3,too long,"These replacement beaters were very well made and looked exactly like our old ones but the center ""stem"" was much too long for our mixer. We had to return them."
3,Didn't Fit,"Ordered these for an old Sears model that was no longer available through the Sears site. They arrived quickly. While the beaters fit into the sockets, the stem was too long making the blades dig into the bowl. We had to send them set back. Now we'll probably have to buy a new mixer for our daughter who dragged her childhood appliance across the country for sentimental baking. Oh well."
1,They didn't fit like they said they would!,I bought them to fit a 1956 Sunbeam and it said that they would fit but they didn't so I had to return them and went and bought a new Kitchen-Aide! Wish it would have fit but the shaft wasn't long enough!
4,Husgow tells us,"Houston, Texas.... There's ...a current of anger and danger that looms over this city. It's Houston that spawned the Fatal Flying Guilloteens....vocalist Mike Modelteen ...sure sounds angry......Yes, this is a punk record. Yes, like many punk records, it is angry in tone. Yes, the songs are short and devoid of guitar solos. But those three chords that make up most punk records never appear on this one. More like a thousand weird ones, a few of which I'm not sure I've ever heard before...24 minutes (10 songs)..(tempo changes)."
3,Bad secondary characters,"This novel reads like a tribute to ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir."" In fact, it makes me want to read that classic again -- but it doesn't live up to it.The lead characters were neat -- Eric was a ghost, but his personality was very solid. It was the secondary characters who spoiled this read. When you have characters named Josh Cunning and Leach Muldavey, you know you're in trouble. Most of the secondary characters are either thoroughly evil, or horribly selish, or all of the above. If they had been more believable, this book would've been a keeper.I gave this book a C at All About Romance."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed to find that half of the study book was already filled in!The study itself is great but I have never had this problem before. When I buy something that says it is in verygood or even just good condition, then it is. I have never had someone send me a filled in book.There were no notes as too the book having writing in it. Many sellers warn you if there is highlightingwriting in the book. This seller did not. It is always such a pain to send it back. Besides I needed it.I was in a time crunch because the first seller I bought from had a problem and could not ship it so Igot a credit and I had to try again and got this garbage. So I had to cover the writing with black marker and now I cannot write my answers in the book I have to use a notepad because I do not have time to get another book.This seller needs to be more conscientious."
5,Wow!,"Nice bright/clear display. The 18"" screen really shows a nice and vivid picture. I'm only using the VGA input right now (my graphics adapter doesn't have DVI...but my next adapter will and I'm now ready for that since this monitor can handle both).Setup was also extremely easy without any troubles."
5,Physical Chemistry,This book is very to the point about the subject of Physical Chemistry as it relates to Mathematics. It provides helpful hints as to how to approach problems. It is a great companion to have in the Physical chemistry course.
4,A best-friend's jelousy leads to the other's death.,The author John Knowles illustrates through the main characters of Phineas and Gene how human beings can be cruel in nature and how they tend to hide the harsh realities of life.
2,A Separate Peace is an over rated book!,I found this book to be rather boring. It was also confusing at times. It didn't have a very good ending because it doesn't tell us what happens to Gene when he goes away to the war. Also I don't understand why Finny had to die and his death wasn't even realistic. Over all I wasn't very impressed by the book.
1,this was so anticlimatic!,"this was one of the worst books i've ever read (almost as bad as watership down). it had no climax and was as nondescriptive as books get. in my humble opinion, dont read the book...read the cliffs notes. this really was a bad book."
2,Um... probably a book you don't want to buy....,"A seperate piece isn't one of those books that can keep you up all night. It does have a few twisted things that make you want to keep reading, but I dont think that teenagers should read this book. It does have a few great themes, but they are really deep and meaningful and not many teens understand them. This book makes you see all teenagers differently and I dont think I've met any one character remotly similar to any of the ones in this book. The emmotions they feel are not only irrational but simply outragous to the point where i became disgusted with my teacher when she implied that all teenagers have this emmotions and reactions. THANK GOD WE DONT! But I would highly recommend the cliff notes to help you better analyse the book."
2,A Separate Peace does not deserve a separate kind of praise,"We had to read 'A Separate Peace' as an English II project. The book started out so slow, that if I wasn't being made to read, I would have abandoned it right away. It is slow, and really has no point. It is also disappointing in the end. I do not suggest this book if you are lookning for and kind of stimulation-intellectual or otherwise."
1,This was a horrible book!,"This book was truly one of the worst books that I have read in my life, and I've read a lot of bad books. I would have stopped reading the book if it hadn't been a school assignment, but I had to read it to pass the test. It is very slow with a high peak when Finny falls from the tree and breaks his leg. The only problem with this is that Finny is the character that everyone loves! I hated this book, and I would strongly recommend that you do not buy it under any condition. As for all of you out there who must read the book for school, buy the cliff notes!"
4,Maybe the author understood,"Well, I think the novel was well written, put there are some keys points left out that would help readers to understand the novel better. For example, ""Why did Gene push Finny out of the tree?"" if even he did it consciously. If he didn't, why dwell on it? This novel is very deep in meaning for the simplistic plot, but all in all, it was worth reading."
1,a very boring and pointless book,first off i think this book is very very boring.the book has some good points but if your thinkin of reading this book for entertainment then you better think twice. if it wasn't for having to read it in school i would have ditched this book when i read the first page. yeah it makes you think but i think that the author was being a little to lazy and jus wrote a bunch of crap that you have to try to fit together. This book is not good at all!
3,"Good effort, poor steering","I should start by saying that I prefer racing simulations to arcade style games. From this perspective, WRC starts out looking good enough - the graphics are excellent, and car physics seem reasonable. However, the steering is overly sensitive. (Yes, even after calibrating the joystick at the PSP system information screen.) If there were a steering sensitivity option, WRC would be just about perfect. Without it, control is difficult and the racing can be frustrating."
2,Great BUT....,"Great graffics, Great visual damage, Good physics, Good sound BUT NO MANUAL TRANSMISSION OPTION!!NO MANUAL TRANSMISSION OPTION!!NO MANUAL TRANSMISSION OPTION!!NO MANUAL TRANSMISSION OPTION!!NO MANUAL TRANSMISSION OPTION!!NO MANUAL TRANSMISSION OPTION!!NO MANUAL TRANSMISSION OPTION!!NO MANUAL TRANSMISSION OPTION!!Enough said, How can we get any joy out of a RALLY game with NO MT option? As soon as reality set in and I was SURE this game had no MT option a knot formed in my stomach, I shut down the PSP, Ejected the game and placed it in it's case. Hopfully I can return it. What a waste! If you think its fun just mashing the gas and ripping up an E-brake for hours on end, go for it. Any true racing enthusiast will say this game feels empty."
5,Goose Creek=Big Fun,"They are indeed the ""Flock that Rocks"". This album is so refreshingly different than anything else you will hear that it is a must have for anyone tired of the same ol same ol. I guess growing up and living just 20 minutes from the Charlie Gearheart Highway (the front man) I may be a little biased, but I think it has universal appeal. I saw the band at a homecoming of sorts at the MAC Arts Center and the show they put on was pure energy. It was like a Dead Head seeing Jerry and the boys playing in SF. That concert has been released on cd as well, and it is on their website. Its all good, get some and enjoy."
4,Excellent saw and easy to use,"This is a perfect saw whether you are doing big or small jobs. It is great for the beginner carpenter as it is not ""scary"" to use.It glides right through and with a perfect edge. Being able to do the angles is great and again very easy to use and adjust.I have used this to completely remodel a home and it is still working like new."
1,Bad saw - excellent service,"The saw handle was broken on arrival. After closer examination of the saw, I discovered it was very cheaply made and a probable safety hazard. The company that carried the saw was very understanding and agreeable when I contacted them. The saw was returned and I received a full refund. This all was done promptly. Excellent people to deal with but a bad quality saw. There were many saws to choose from, but I made a cheap decision when picking the saw and that is what I got - cheap. Lesson learned."
1,Thirty Frames Per Second: The Visionary Art of the Music Video,"Not exactly what I was thinking. The title is misleading, the text is unreadable. The idea is good but who care to see picture of actual video. It would have be nice to have video made of this book. Waste of time try to read it."
2,Surprisingly amateurish--straw men,"I started having serious problems with this book around Chapter 1, when Postrel lays out her ""stasist"" versus ""dynamist"" thesis. I don't disagree with her that the terms ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" are ossified and meaningless, but this book does little to shed light on current political paradigms. Ms. Postrel appears to have started with her conclusion and then picked pop culture phenomenon, political leaders, etc. that fit into her theory, which is just as rigid as the ""stasism"" she claims to reject. She is a facile and, at times, entertaining writer, but this book sets up a static straw man to serve as a counterpoint to her ""dynamists."" The overall effect reads like a cut-and-paste senior thesis. Dynamism, in her somewhat murky view, appears to be warmed-over libertarianism, but don't count on the intelligence or critical thinking of a John Hospers in this volume."
3,Some Good Ideas But,The book is interspersed with some good ideas and examples but is mostly a boring and redundant read.
2,"An amazing compilation, but ""I am like - whoa"" to this book","This is an amazing compilation of the abundant things that individuals and groups can achieve, when given the freedom, of which book itself is an example. Beyond that, I could never agree that the basic conflict determining the future is that between dynamists and stasists. What some dynamists seek to do may be very evil, and others may be labeled as stasists, for example William Bennett, for doing what is arguably very beneficial. Not everything that can be done should be done, and there are abundant proofs of that. The concept of ""nested rules"" makes sense only when pursued within overall boundaries that ethically limit human endeavor. The real conflict in human affairs remains that between good and evil, and this book clouds that fact."
2,Pollyanna to the rescue!,"I am neither and resent the categorical assumptions. This is asinine. There are in fact consequences intended and otherwise to every technology. Information technology is a double edged sword that cuts both ways. If you have not yet read ""Transfer-the end of the beginnng"" by Jerry Furland, get busy and do so. Or not. It's only your future."
2,Very dry and boring,If you need something to put you to sleep read a couple of pages just before bed time.
5,Good book! A different perspective on opponents of change!,"A very interesting perspective by Postrel. She casts aside Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal. Coining a new word, stasists, she shows that opponents to change come in many forms, but that they all stand in the way of real human progress. She suggests that if we embrace change while respecting individual liberty, our future is bright indeed!"
3,"Wasp, where is thy sting?","Postrel, a usually fantastic writer, is so apparently afraid of writing polemically that she has turned in the apposite direction completely, delivering a work all but devoid of any passion or, especially, exuberance. This is absolutely the last talking head book I will ever read; so much time is spend responding to critics that only other talking heads had heard of. I completely agree with Postrel's thesis, which makes the anemia in her prose all the worse."
3,good premise but too long,"As a firm believer in the evolution of society (part of the choir so to speak), I enjoyed this book at first. Unfortunately, as the author went on and on, I just began to wish it would end.Overall, this entire premise would've been better covered in a 8-10 page magazine article. Brevity may be known as the source of wit, but for some of us, brevity is also the source of 5 star book reviews.As a plus, I thought the author did a good job of footnoting her anecdotes."
3,A provovative view of the future!,"Although the book has many interesting and provocative ideas about the forces which are likely to shape the next century, it is informed by a concervative ideology against the government's role in the economy. I believe that the author is wrong to suggest that government planning and managing change results always in stasis. Three, out of many historical examples, refute this thesis: The Manhattan Project's planning and development of nuclear fission produced the atomic bomb before Hitler. The U.S. Interstate Highway project was the result of government central planning that transformed life in America and generated enormous economic growth. Despite the author's dismissal of NASA as sluggish and noncompetitive, the agency has ushered in the space age and a plethora of technological marvels. Nevertheless, this book is worth reading and it will make a significant contribution to the debate about our future."
5,This is a must read to think about the future,Postrel does an amazing job of explaining why the Luddites who fear technology and the Technocrats who claim they can manage it are the enemies of the future. She divides the world into stasists (who include people as diverse as Pat Buchanan and Al Gore) and dynamists. She describes the operating assumptions of both groups and then leads us through a series of discussions including the necessity for games and playful thinking for anyone who wants to think about the future. What is great about this book is both her clarity of style and her stunning insights. Anyone who is interested in either the new economy or the politics of technological development should read this book.
2,Should of just used a screwdriver.,The tip was too thick to pull the clips properly. I basically just used it as a pry bar. A screwdriver would have done the same. 2007 Mazda6
2,Breadman TR444 kneading Paddle,In website it is advertised as a paddle for breadman TR 444 breadmachine. I bought the product and it doesn't fit in the pan. Paid $16.00. When I called the Breadman service center they say that they don't manufacture this paddle anymore. Please if anyone knows a good solution for this post it. There is no point in sending it back to the seller paying for the shipping. I am disappointed.
1,Was not the right piece,The notes said that it would fit my machine and it does not. I was very disappointed as I was looking forward to trying the bread machine.
1,does not fit,"The inner diameter of the rounded part of this paddle, which is what connects it to the bread pan, is too small. It does not fit the TR333 bread pan as advertised. (At least the one shipped to me does not.) As such, it is unusable."
2,if you like to eat teflon,the coating comes off very quickly and does not wash easily. Will work okay if you usually use the dough setting.
2,Did not fit MY TR444,The 20603 paddle arrived promptly. But it absolutely did not fit my Breadman model TR444. I returned it and received a refund of the purchase price. So I wasted $8 for expedited shipping and another $1.50 for return shipping.
4,Breadman paddle,"I love my breadmaker. We received it as a wedding gift in 2000. I use it on average once/week. During Thanksgiving & Christmas that increases significantly - Usually 2x/day.The paddle lasted a good 7+ years...The non-stick coating started to peel off (scary!).Finding this part for the machine was pretty easy.The part # does not match my bread machine part #, but I found a website that told me what Breadmans it would fit.It's working great again!"
4,A good and fair game,"This was a pretty good game for 1997, the controlles were fair, the gameplay itself was fair, I also liked the levels because they were all parts form the movie. Level 1 is your training in the basic D.I.D. Level 2 is where you're going threw the hero Gauntlet. Level 3 is where your in centour forest then fight Nessese. Level 4 is where you're on the big olive. Level 5 is where you battle the Hydra. Level 6 is where you battle Medusa. Level 7 is where you run away from the cyclops. Level 8 is where you battle the Titans. Level 9 is where you go threw the underworld. Level 10 is where you go threw Hades's place. Then level 11 is where you battle Hades. Well, anyway. When you run low on heath get some Herculade which is scatered all over the levels. So anyway. This game was origanal for it's time."
3,Unfortunate changes,"In the original opera, Adams and Goodman walked the fine line pretty well. Goodman, being part of the ""NY Elite"" couldn't help but try to equate the plight of the Palestinians to that of the Jews, which is an absurd apples and oranges comparison, but she definitely held back and because of that, the opera is still enjoyable, even as one wishes for perhaps a bit more history.The film makes no such attempt--quite the opposite--and thus tips over the line, presenting the situations as if they are mirror-images.Technically, the film is competent, and the adaptation of Adams music is superb. But as a political statement--which it is, despite hand-waving about ""presenting both sides""--it is distorted and thus fails."
5,Filming an opera - new art form,"A wonderfully moving and impartial (in spite of what some of the other reviewers have said!) human drama. The film shows how the sorrow of the Palestinians and Israelis flows from generation to generation and always results in personal tragedy. All of the terrorists and hostages are personalized and their fear is made real by superb acting and singing to wonderful music. The artificiality of much opera dissolves in the immediacy of the filming, and the result is very direct and moving.Very valuable on this CD are the extras: a full rerun of the whole opera with the background comments of the director and lead singers, and a talk with the director and John Adams himself, commenting on this new art form. Superb performances by Maltman and Howard."
4,an okay bio,"This is a hastely put together although reasonably adequate biography of Kurt Cobain and the legendary band Nirvana. Some interesting background info on Cobain's childhood and earlier years, and lots of info on his musical life with the band and their rise as recording artists. Easy to read, but not terribly comprehensive. Worth checking out if you're a Nirvana fan or want to read about the tragic life and death of a rock star.David Rehakauthor of ""A Young Girl's Crimes"""
1,The most boring Kurt Cobain book,"This book has no structure... Its so boring. Usually when I read a book about Kurt Cobain I cant put it down, but this one I could... EASILY. Ive tried on many occasions, to read this book and stick with it, but I couldnt. Its almost like a addict who cant quit whatever, they just fail. And I failed to enjoy this book. Its boring, and it only talks about stuff Ive already heard. And it documents when the fans and world heard about Cobain's death. Its a good thing I didnt buy it new, and got it for $2.99 at Half Price books, I couldnt have ever forgiven myself for wasting my money on this. Its even worse than Heavier than Heaven... Read Who killed Kurt Cobain? or Love and Death, by the same genius authors. The truth is in those novels."
2,"well,...","The story behind Kurt Cobain is extremely interesting, and I for one kept wanting to know more as I read. I would not say that the book is very well-written, though. I would definitely recommend something about Cobain for someone looking for an interesting biography, but not necesarily this particular book."
3,Great Book,I couldnt put the book down. It gives great insight to the tormented events of Kurts life..
3,"subject material excellent, but something is missing","when cobain died i searched for answers. i bought the only two books on the subject. while informative, this book lacks something. the michael a. book was a lot better. i dont want to say this, but this book feels like it was published by someone who didnt even know cobain or his music, and was just reporting facts."
3,It is a fair book,"This book displays only the main points of the history of Kurt Cobain and Nirvana. I feel that it was a good book to read, if you have the time, but ""Cobain"" or ""Come As You Are"" would be wiser choices."
3,S'okay,"If you've already read ""Come As You Are,"" skip this book. This book is a rather abridged version and it doesn't reveal anything new. In fact, you feel like the writer copied Azerrad's story word for word. It's not the best book written on Nirvana, but then again, it doesn't try to be. While I applaud the author's honest portrayal of the band, it's hard to ignore how much Azerrad's book is better. On the other hand, if you're ever doing a research paper on Nirvana, this is a nice addition to pad your bibliography"
2,Don't buy this book,"I am a big fan of Nirvana. I have read a great deal of articles about them, seen documentaries and other films on them but I think this book is NOT worth the money. I got this book from a friend who never read it because she wasn't very interested in Kurt Cobain, so she had nothing to say about the book. While this book is only about 160 pages, it's one that takes forever to read because you continually want to put it down. The photographs in the middle of the book are less than what would be expected in a biography. Overall I found only one chapter in this book worth reading. Don't waste your money."
1,it reads like vanity fair.,"this is by far the WORST kurt cobain book i have ever read. the entire thing reads like a tabloid, and anyone who didnt pick up on that fact obviously knows absolutely nothing about nirvana. dave thompson never met kurt cobain, so he didnt have any firsthand experience with the band. he portrays kurt as a total hero, and courtney love as a horrible talent-draining heroin addict. ive also noticed that the only people who seem to have enjoyed this book are the ones who have watched kurt and courtney, believed hank harrison, and proclaimed themselves nirvana experts. if you want a read nirvana book, get come as you are by michael azzerad."
2,Book,"I read this book years ago when it first came out and it has many flaws. There are numerous inaccurate facts such as dates and times and locations. I believe it even said that Aberdeen is a suburb of Seattle, which is totally not true. My parents grew up in Aberdeen and it is a few hours away from Seattle. Aberdeen is in western WA on the coast, while Seattle is up near Puget Sound. I would suggest a different book if you want to read about Kurt Cobain. A good one is the ""Come As You Are"" book or the new one called ""Heavier Than Heaven"" by Charles Cross, which I hope to have in my hands soon."
2,Kurt Cobain was Murdered,"Isnt it amazing, that in this day and age, there are still organizations like the Seattle Police Department, that believe just because someone is an addict, that it doesnt really matter how they died?Kurt was a beautiful and caring artist--even if he was an addict. The people responsible for his MURDER need to be brought to justice.Any book which doesnt relay the horrible inconsistencies surrounding the so-called police investigation of Kurt's death, is either very shoddy; or in league with the murderers.Read the site cobaincase.com, if you want to know the details.And this reviewer has NEVER found conspiracy theories seductive in and of themselves."
2,Eh...... no.,"This CD is not so great. The OAVs were okay, but too rushed, and nothing stood out about them, either. Quite a bit of this CD consists of drama tracks, which is only amusing if you can translate it. The manga artist sings a few of the songs (he sucks), but that's kinda neat. Akino Arai (not Nii, as they're saying) sings a song, but it's not her best work. Same with Mayumi Sudou. But the music box version of the opening theme is very pretty, and Takeshi's BGM is pretty amusing, if not a little, um, tacky? I would recommend this ONLY to either people who are obsessed with Video Girl Ai or for people who just HAVE to own every domestic released anime CD. Otherwise... go spend your money on something worth it."
3,misquote,"postage was much, much higher than predicted in orderingI know that postage to Hawaii can be outrageous, so I am careful of ordering only from companies that ship USPS priority mail (sometimes lised as flat rate). . . BECAUSE . . . . UPS and FedEx will only do overnight which is an exorbitant fee. This company listed as ""flat rate"" but than shipped FedEx, with me paying the difference. An unneccessary and unfair charge."
3,Stone Dust is a good mystery,"A good mystery of homeland. Ben Abbott takes on a moonlighting role into solving the murder of Reg Hopkins and is faced with questioning everyone in his hometown friends, family, and foes.A good mystery that keeps you guessing but does not hold up to the first in the series Hardscape. However, it is a good mystery and I recomend it."
4,Worth starting the series.,The first Ben Abbott book of the series. Worth reading as Scott introduces us to Ben Abbott and his trials and tribulations as he stumbles his way from realator to part time PI. Read them all...you'll like them. Plus...very reasonable on the ebook price! Ain't that nice for a change!
4,the murder rate is climbing,"The little town of Newbury, CT has a murder rate that is climbing with each Ben Abbott novel. Justin Scott does an excellent job with the characters and this second novel in the series is as good as the first. The plot is intricate and does not involve a lot of mayhem. It follows the first novel characters a bit but it is a new story and a new plot. His politics get a tiny bit intrusive at points (he doesn't like Republicans) but, considering this is Connecticut, it is tolerable. An enjoyable murder mystery and well done character development."
5,So Much Better Than Flat Screen Monitors!,"Flat screen monitors may be ""cool"" but their image quality is junk. They look cartoonish like washed-out, fuzzy watercolors in comparison to a good CRT screen.I do professional photography and I need to see images in true color, at high resolution and with maximum dynamic range. I tried several flat screen monitors and returned them all. This CRT screen is perfect!I have had this monitor for a couple of years now and it is still beautiful to use every day!"
1,Is he serious?,"Don't waste your time on this racist, biased trash. Racism still is alive and well although Mr. Rowan seems unaware of the fact that this type of book does nothing but cultivate it.I would have given this review 0 stars although that is not possible."
3,"You're kidding me, right?","While this film is not bad, for a made for TV flick, it is a complete injustice to bill it as a ""Robert Pattinson film:. The story is about Charlie, and her relationship with her mother and grandmother. Daniel Gale is an ancillary character at best. This is nothing short of opportunistic advertising, and marketing making the assumption that the public doesn't know better."
3,cut scenes,"This is a charming movie and the dvd quality is fine, but this version is edited. Cut up scenes and words omitted."
3,Its okay,I bought this movie because of Rob Pattinson being in it. Its kind of an endearing movie where his character gets involved with a girl who is pregnant by another and he gets himself involved with her and her dysfunctional family. It works out in the end.
3,Bad Mother's Handbook,"I'm a definite fan of Rob Pattison, but I think he's a better actor than this film portrays. I can't say I enjoyed the plot of the film but it does show Pattison's versitally. He's much better in the Twilight Saga movies."
5,Great early work of Robert Pattinson,This is a very cute movie and it is a good teen flick but can be enjoyed by all age groups. All characters are well cast in the role's.
2,The Bad Mother's Handbook,"The cover may advertise Rob Pattinson (from the Twilight Saga), but he's hardly in it. The movie is really dull, and at times boring. The movie is just about how Charlie & her mother don't get along and that Charlie's mom is adopted. the movie isn't too good. It's a total Made for TV movie, but this movie isn't really worth watching. It's really short (69mins) and the credits are 30seconds long so yeah. The movie is something you'd see on LifeTime or something. If your a Twilight Fan, then you'll love, if not then just skip it."
4,Catherine Tate In a Sensitive Role?,"I do not think of Catherine Tate as a tender, sensitive actor, but that is what you get in this film. Tate's comedy usually isn't my taste, but this was a sweet surprise and you do get some of her acerbic style.The DVD cover features Robert Pattinson who plays a small role. I read that he doesn't consider himself a comedy actor, but he is very funny and endearing as Daniel.I was actually hadn't considered this DVD until I read some of the other comments. It turned out to be quite enjoyable."
3,"The movie is fine, but the DVD itself could use some work","The movie was marketed after Mr.Pattinson hit it big with the tweens in Twilight and they knew they could make a buck putting this on DVD. I was disappointed to see that while watching a DVD the ""F"" word was actually BLEEPED out. Really? BLEEPED on a DVD? It was only used once in the film, and the ""S"" word is never bleeped on British TV, but I was disappointed in that. I also felt like it was cut up a bit from the original, but it's still likable.The book is far better, but the movie did it justice."
4,Movie/Seller Review,"This movie isn't 'face' time for Robert Pattinson so if that's what your hoping for then you maybe a bit disappointed not that he's not throughout the movie but the focus is actually on the 3 women in the film, mainly Catherine Tate. It's about mother-daughter relationships (all kinds). It's a wonderful film for me because I enjoy the actors presented and I think the film was well shot, and the movie was one that I enjoy. I won't give away the details but I will say it can be a movie that can make you laugh and cry, if you're into it."
2,Disappointing,"If you are into modern blues such as Stevie Ray Vaughn, Eric Clapton or recent B.B. King this album is not for you. The recordings are poorly done and the blues are so old that they sound more like 30's jazz. I realize that this is where blues started but if you enjoy listening to that fast blues guitar or harmonica you will not find it here."
3,This set would be better if all the tracks were labeled correctly,"This set is a pretty good overview of 40s-50s blues (With the exception of the Holliday tracks) and it is worth noting that the following tracks are mislabeled:Disc 1, track 2 should be: Muddy Waters - Stuff You Gotta WatchDisc 1, track 7 soulld be: Muddy Waters - Iodine In My CoffeeDisc 3, track 11 should be: Muddy Waters - Train Fare Home"
5,"Foe Loco, New & Commin Thru","this album is tight. most tracks have tight beatz and mr doctor comez up in every song. if u own mr doctor the odysea, then yall gotta peep this album. therez some artists that you havent heard of but if you down with black market and tight beatz, get this album."
3,Italian 101,"The grammar exercises in the book do not have an answer key, which does not allow for complete learning experience. The CD's are helpful, but do not announce from what page of the textbook the readings are and often I found myself frantically going through pages looking to match the reading in the book with the track on the CD. Not a good study guide for a completely novice Italian learner."
5,Yay!,I love this textbook! I used to study from the older version but this one is even better! I hope they keep improving as they go along. It's nice to have a good Italian textbook out there since it's not that common of a language being studied.
1,BAD BUSINESS PRACTICE,"AD SAID THE BOOK CAME WITH A AUDIO CD. IT ARRIVED WITH OUT THE CD.NOT GOOD BUSINESS PRACTICE.Ciao! (with Audio CD) by Carla Larese Riga, Chiara Maria Dal Martello"
3,CIAO with Audio CD 6th edition,The product was accurately reported however; the 2 CDs that were to have been included were not forwarded. LB Enterprises in a reply stated that these would be forwarded upon receipt of the shipping address. As of this date and time they HAVE NOT been sent despite another request being sent asking for this vendor to make good on its promise. I personally would NEVER deal with this seller again.
1,Ciao!,I ordered the book Ciao! by Carla Larese Riga with the Audio CD and although the book was in good condition it did not include the Audio CD's.
1,Featureless,"The Motofone F3 is about the most featureless phone that I have ever seen from Motorola. It is garbage! Personally, I have owned two of these ""bottom-end"" cellular devices (which I would not even recommend for use by a kindergardener) which I had to return for malfunctioning for no reason at all. There are not only no features which would redeem this piece of junk, there are no accessories (earpieces, cases, NOTHING). I can now see why Motorola is selling it's handheld end off as the best it has had the ability to do for years is update it's aging RAZR Phone."
4,Dependable little bugger,"This phone is intended for a very specific customer - namely one who hates all of the extra junk that is crammed on phones these days. This phone has excellent battery life (I get 5-6 days on a charge), excellent reception, the earpiece and speakerphone are loud and clear, it's Razr thin, and fits very nicely in my pocket.Negatives are that texting (actually, anything to do with reading text, such as names in address book) is rather difficult to do. 6 letters can be displayed on the screen at a time, so you have to scroll quite a bit to read a text. Next, although this phone is supposed to be virtually indestructible, the battery cover comes out just as easily as on most other phones. So don't test this thing by throwing it around.And if you get it, try pulling the battery out while it is on. The screen does some nifty stuff."
4,Great BASIC Phone,"I am a cellphone novice. My only other cellphone was a Nokia go-phone. All to say, I just need a phone to make a call - no other bells or whistles. This phone has good reception and speaker. I have no trouble with the sound quality and have heard no complaints from people that I am talking to. I think that this phone would be frustrating for people that are used to a lot of extras, or who do a lot of texting, but if you just want a good, reliable phone to make a good old-fashioned call, then this one is hard to beat."
1,Bev's Review,THIS PHONE WAS NOT UNLOCKED AS DESCRIBED IN THE AD. I TOOK IT OVERSEAS AND ACTIVATED IT. I BOUGHT A CHIP AND THE PHONE COMPANY TOLD ME THAT THE PHONE WAS NOT UNLOCKED AND THEY DID NOT HAVE THE MANUFACTURER'S CODE TO UNLOCK IT. IT COST ME MONEY TO BUY ANOTHER PHONE. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PR0DUCT TO ANYONE.
5,perfect for startups,"if you ever want to know everything about business planning (beeing a first time entrepreneur), you need this book."
2,A Disappointment,"I took this disc for a spin...a couple of times, and was disappointed each time. Some cds take time to grow on you; I gave this one a chance, but it just fell short. I originally bought this cd because the song cinematographic had me hooked me. But there weren't very many standout songs other than this one. Unfortunately, many of the songs sounded similar. I was hoping for a better effort."
5,E-Trigger,I bought one of these to upgrade a Kingman Spyder Victor 09 from semi to semi/3 ball/auto. Be warned! Full auto + a gravity hopper can cause really bad blowback and ball burst with cheap paint... an issue I never had with the regular trigger (maybe I never shot that fast before or I changed the FPS by accident). When i switched from the cheap paint to the normal stuff (you can find them in any sports authority store) I have not had ANY issues. Just be careful as there are gaps by the charge port/switch/LED so do not get those areas wet.
2,cheap material,After only ten times operating the selector switch the switch broke off. The way the switch is nested within the grip it is not subject to damage and may only be operated with intention. Whenever I did operate the switch I only moved it from off to the semi position where it stayed throughout the match. I was left with no way to operate the Marker without removing the battery. There is no safety for this ETrigger so you MUST turn it off with the switch. I am still trying to either get it replaced or repaired.
4,Excellent except for...,Great product fit my gun but i had to force it on screws dont match up 100 percent so gun looks a bit weird but does the job be careful and dont force it onAny questions just ask-Bee
3,stott pilates - essential bosu,"This DVD is a little slow. Good beginners level. If you're looking for something strenuous, this isn't it, but it is a good introduction to working out on the bosu ball. In the end, my abs got a decent workout, though."
1,Música-Marketing,"Ana Carolina is a good singer and Seu Jorge is a cult culture figure here in Brazil, but this CD is a mistake. Do not spend money on this."
1,WHAT A DISASTER!,"I bought this CD in order of listening to something from Brazil. This is the worst thing I've ever listened in my life. And the bad thing is one information I had from friends of mine in Brazil, Both Ana and Seu Jorge have avoided to say during shows that the song ""É isso ai"" it's just a version (I guess composed by a musician called Damien Rice), as if they were the composers, this is the worst thing one artist could do. They said that ""DURING A TV PROGRAM CALLED ""ALTAS HORAS"", WHILE ANA WAS SINGING THIS SONG, APPEARED BELOW ON TV, THEIR NAMES, AS COMPOSERS. WHAT IS THAT, THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS THING TO DO, SIMPLY DON'T BUY IT, IT'S A DISASTER!IF YOU WANT REALLY GOOD MUSIC FROM BRAZIL DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THESE POOR MUSICIANS, BUY ""TOM JOBIM"" THE GREAT MASTER FROM BRAZIL."
1,Not Fair and Balance,"One sided view only, not fair and balanced. In the eyes of the behoden only. It may have been an outstanding book if he had reported the other side which lead up to this condition. Was it another ""staged"" event. Another ""fake funeral""?"
1,Aid to Arabs,"All the people who complain about massive aid to Israel should consider the trillions of dollars given in aid to Arab nations over the last 40 years. This aid is far greater than the sum of loans (which must be used to buy American equipment) and grants to Israel, none of which have ever been forgiven.Aid to Arab nations has bought us--propaganda, like this film, a classic Islamic incitement to hatred, if ever there was one. Good grief."
1,Hypocracy at its peak,"This film was shot from angles that are deceptive and biased. For those out there who are interested in learning about human rights abuses, I recommend watching the videos smuggled out of North Korea. In these videos you will see real suffering committed against children and the innocent. The entire Palestinian Intifadah has not even cost 1,000 lives while the North KOrean government has led to the death of three million of its own people.Let's put things into perspective, Please!"
5,Changed me,"I will never look at the Mid East conflict the same way again after watching this film. It's something I always wanted and never had, to look inside at the Palestinian's world. And this film gave me that chance. Can't recommend it more highly."
4,Why don't we have more sympathy?,"I was compelled by the young Palestinians who live in a world that revolves around people under 20 years old.The film caught me off guard. It wraps up the Arab/Israeli conflict in a way that no written editorial could. These faces are sincere - young children, really, who are fighting against the force that keeps them penned up in a world with no trees, no beauty from nature.The filming of this movie is eloquent and strong. I believe the interpreters deserve an abundance of credit.Americans all would do well to sit still for this movie and soak it in. I am pleased that we are able to see more than one side to any story. It balances us and makes us durable as a people. Thank you, Amazon, for offering this film."
1,One-Sided Propaganda,"After my daughter saw this documentary in her high school, she came home and asked me why we like Israel so much? She then told me that Israel does lots of bad things like shoot children, uses poison gas against Palestinians, and even puts bombs in boxing gloves for Palestinian children to find to kill them. She got all this from this movie. My husband and I got the movie from her teacher to view and saw for ourselves how biased this movie was. It did not spread hope, only hate. It also graphically shows a little Palestinian boys dead body with half of his body blown apart. It was heart-breaking. All these bad things are supposed to be done and caused by the Jews in Israel. We were very dissapointed in this film and asked the teacher to replace it with the film, Promises, instead. Promises shows young Israeli and Palestinian children growing up and shows each side with more hope toward a future together with peace."
5,still a timely and compelling film,"The material in this documentary was filmed in 2001 -- but it still feels like it could have been made yesterday. Unfortunately, the situation in the Gaza Strip has remained almost exactly the same for three years -- if anything it has just gotten worse.This film is quite strong, original and even brilliant in its portrayal. The narrative of the documentary flows in and out of the life of a 13-year-old newspaper boy in Gaza, making transitions into scenes from other parts of the Gaza Strip: A road blackade that has forced Palestinians onto the beach, an Israeli gas attack on Khan Yunis, house demolitions in the middle of the night, the death of a child and the seeds of young martyrdom. This is the most powerful documentary I have found on this subject, and it's important for anyone who wants to expand their view of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict."
3,Book on CD,"This was my first, and will be my last, book on cd. I'm sure the content is good, from what I heard, but I am not comfortable with an audio version. I'd much prefer a book that I can browse and read at my own pace. I found the background and introductory music to be annoying after a while, and it was difficult to maintain continuity over a period of time. I intend to get the book since I'm sure I would benefit more using that media."
4,Intelligent reading,Salinger and Gross provide an insider's account of the political and managerial pressures on a foreign correspondent. The tension felt by a reporting soloist is wrapped in a very entertaining spy story. The spy story is framework for two famous and seasoned writers (Gross and Salinger) to bring readers an education of what it is like for a correspondent to work on an important international story and to endure the conspiracies of governments and companies to manipulate the ultimate telling of the story. There is little to quibble with in this book if you read it for real story. The writing style is obviously by authors of the highest intelligence.
2,Not enough to hold interest,"There was little to hold my interest in the book, until the end and even then it was easy to put down. I felt the character was forced and the romance was unrealistic.I wouldn't recommend this if you like action packed books or a true suspense novel."
5,"Charlene Hosenfeld, Ph.D.","Dr. McMullin has written a valuable book for individuals who have been, are, or might someday be in therapy -- as well as for those who want to learn on their own to have an emotionally healthy and satisfying life. Through the use of humor, metaphors, examples, exercises, and tips, he teaches the reader to identify their thoughts and beliefs, to examine them, and to change or ""trash"" the ones that are inaccurate and/or harmful to one's mental health. He guides the reader through a structured process of cognitive change in this well-organized and user-friendly book. ""Taking Out Your Mental Trash"" fills a void in the cognitive therapy literature by offering a step-by-step approach to those motivated and interested in making lasting and beneficial changes to their thinking -- and therefore to the whole of their lives. I highly recommend this book to therapists for use with their clients, to clients, and to anyone who wants to learn to think clearly and to feel better."
5,Practical Book - not just a bunch of theory,This book was very helpful. Its step by step approach helped me gently but firmly identify emotional traps and challenge assumptions which were keeping me stuck in a dysfunctional situation. This is a practical book for practical use - not just a bunch of theory. I appreciate that! It was most helpful when I shared the most challenging parts with a trusted friend. He and it helped me consider my situation with clarity so that I could make healthy decisions. I'm sure it would work well with a counselor too. Thanks Dr. McMullin.
2,Clumsy Translation,"What's fascinating about Taking Out Your Trash is its somewhat confusing nature for a self-improvement workbook. In comparison to the author's much more clearly written The New Handbook of Cognitive Therapy Techniques which read clearly and straightforward, the workbank instead seems to lose something in the translation into practical exercises. In comparing the number of workbooks that allow a full expression of ideas and concepts, this workbook seems to be limited in the nature of its lessions to fully explore the concepts and theory developed in the Handbook."
3,Missing the original Stepponwolf,"As a traditionalist who's into the older original sounds of Stepponwolf, it was hard for me to get into this. It took repeated listenings to finally start to appreciate John Kays message. The recording is just to modern for the kind of Stepponwolf I like. John Kays vocals are good but it sounds like he recorded his parts later after all the other parts were recorded first. He's not jamming with the band,instead it sounds as if he is singing over the top of everthing else. Many artist record that way now without the listener noticing it but they did a poor job with this one. There are a few good songs I liked but most I did not care for. The instruments are recorded well. The drums in particular were recorded nicely but he plays to basic in comparison to the original drummer who is excellent. Final thought: If your a John Kay fan Buy it! If your a Stepponwolf the group fan Skip it!"
1,Latest News,"How many times is John going to include {Give me some news I can use} on an album?This is like the fourth or fifth time it appears on different releases...Why is he so fixated on this song???..This album is akin to {At Your Birthday Party} and is one of my least favorite albums in Steppenwolf's catalog.Instead of releasing this,John should have gravitated toward the original sound that made the name!!"
1,strap buckles are weak,the strap buckle broke after 1-2 uses in surf.snorkel usage seemed to be ok.the open toe also contributes to blisters.fin socks recommended.
2,Weak Strap Assembly,"Bought a pair last year for body surfing, and was quite content with them for a while - they made battling breakers a cinch.Then one day, with the ocean a bit stronger than average, the strap on one of them simply broke. It eventually washed ashore, and that's when I noticed that there was a flimsy and thin plastic pin securing the part that wraps around and secures the tins to the ankle. That pin just sheared off from one side.Seems like a bone-headed design defect - considering the stresses those fins are subjected to, you'd think somebody somewhere in R&D; would've figured that something a bit sturdier should be utilized.Only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one (or even less were that possible) is that they were pretty sweet up until the moment they broke.So I guess they're good for swimming pools or calm waters, but don't bank on them in rough seas."
2,Strap breaks easily,"The back strap of these fins, as others have complained, breaks off easily and quickly. Mine broke on the second time using them on my vacation. I managed to rig up a solution so I could wear them for the rest of the vacation, but the broken fin kept coming loose.When they weren't broken, they did seem to work well. I would not suggest them for people with wide feet, however. I purchased a large, and my feet barely fit in comfortably.All in all, i'm pretty disappointed."
2,Not what the pro's use,"I took these fins on a Hawaiian vacation in January. I used them for boogie boarding at Waimea Bay on the North Shore and snorkeling at Hanauma Bay. These fins were a big let down. They were uncomfortable and didn't propel very well. The ankle strap doesn't cinch up fully making it useless. During the second half of the vacation, I used a regular pair of fins and they performed much better. I also found that they stayed on my feet better when wiping out in the big waves.While at Bonzai Pipeline, I also watched some of the really good boogie boarders and it looked like many were wearing regular fins with a couple inches cut off...nothing ""fancy"" like these.Pros:-Adjustable heel strap.-Small size for vacationing-They look cool (by you may look like a tourist when among experienced boogie boarders)Cons:-Very uncomfortable. The plastic around my foot was very tight and stiff. Because of the tight fit, sand would get lodged between my feet and the plastic.-Poor propulsion."
1,These fins gave my wife and I blisters,"We bought Shredder fins at Walmart, because they looked adjustable, the heel strap was comfortable, they come with ankle tethers, and I use a pair of longfins from US Divers for scuba.All that said, there is a huge design flaw with these fins: the drainage hole is too big. The hole is so large that your toes press up against the edge of it, and this creates friction in specific spots when you're kicking and swimming.My wife and I got blisters on both feet in the same spot - on the top inside part of our big toes. Ouch. I would not recommend you use these fins even if they were given to you for free."
1,Worst Decision Ever!1,"They break after two weeks of occasional use and often times leak a red substance while in the water. The worst part was they fell apart at the most inopportune time, when I was three miles off the coast!!!!!!!!!1"
2,Short Fins,"The good news is they are easy to pack & save a lot of space. The bad news is that because they are so short they really don't provide much thrust; it's a trade off. However, if the point is to make it possible to snorkle greater distances then you will come up short."
4,Swim Fins,"I travel to Hawaii quite a bit and was looking for a pair of swim fins that would be easy to pack in a suitcase. They are excellent for that. I have used them for body surfing with a boogie board and for snorkeling. They don't have the power of full size fins and they are a little stiff, but they work well for my purpose."
2,Watch out if you have wide feet,"These are nice fins. I'd have loved them, especially with the fin keeper straps right on the fin. One big problem though, these are made for people with narrow feet and low insteps. I do not have either and had to return the fins. The were too tight on my toes,and bit into the top of my foot badly."
4,Very Nice - but may not fit wide feet.,"Nice fins, they fit my wife perfectly. The large size did not fit very well on myself.These fins do not seem to accommodate wide feet very well. If you have regular feet you will love the fit!Rafael G."
3,Rough edge,"This is a good product that I have purchased for the second time mainly because it is heavier than the other options in the market and they help me strengthen my leg muscles when practicing kick at the swimming pool. The downside is that the top edge causes blisters on my feet until I get used to them, which takes a couple of weeks at least."
4,"Good enough quality, but short/tight","Awesome choice for a size 11 foot, 10 with a thick sock/thin boot, but I wear a loose 12 or tight 13 Rockport, on the narrow side. These are way too tight for a 12/13 if you wear thin neoprene socks, and still a bit painful after a few minutes swimming, both in width of the front of the foot and depth from the straps in the back (at maximum extension even).Too bad they don't make a size 13-15, that's be great for us 12-ers."
3,Comfortable BUT Not For BodyBoarding!!,"I picked these fins up a few months ago out of desperation, took them out to bodyboarding... they are extremely comfortable, I love the open toe design.Sadly they offer very little in the way of power. Didn't really realize this until I bought some ALLY fins. If you are getting these for bodyboarding, DON'T."
3,Sizing is off,"I wear a size 12, so I bought the large which is supposed to fit sizes 11-13. I can barely fit my bare foot in these fins. Booties will NOT be possible. A person who normally wears size 13 would NEVER be able to wear these. I may return them.I just added a star because the tight fit seems to be easing up with use. I also have found that I can use them with neoprene socks (1.5mm)."
5,Fintastic,These fins were everything I expected and more! They fit great and are very comfortable in both the surf and pool. U.S. Divers - always the best!!!
4,Worked for awhile,"Stoked for a new set of fins and Mexico.I had the old style with split fin and while I enjoyed the comfort, I needed more juice to launch ride. Decided to try new design and I was pleased. I could feel the difference in take off on first ride. The fin fits tight, it is narrow as the other reviews have mentioned. I was worried about that and my toes being shredded on outlet end, but once in the water I found I could loosen the straps and the fins held on fine. That is the good.The bad is the security ankle strap slides loose after awhile so you have to give it a pull now and then and one of the pieces that you pull to open to allow the foot strap to loosen fell off in the water. Gone in the deep blue. Grrrrrr so that side of strap is held on by tywraps. Duct tape and tywraps required in travel bag :)update I contacted Amzon about problem and they are sending me a replacement flipper. No further questions. True story!"
1,defective,"Nephew got them; I borrowed & wore in head high surf for body surfing & rip avoidance... I promptly snapped inside left buckle off. NOT broken, just the plastic pins came out of the holes. We returned to store ((1) day old) and he got fins replaced for free & I bought a pair b/c I liked the power in heavier surf.Next day same thing happened to me. I returned & got Makapu's...I liked the leash & they were comfortable & fast. Weak spot however in construction; they will NEVER last b/c of weak link in clip. If you have them in your hand in store, you can pull off that clip w/o too much effort, so imagine in a crucial situation..."
2,Recommended for swimming only,"Originally, I bought these fins for body boarding. After using these fins for my fifth time in less than a month, one of the side buckles broke off while swimming, and are now permanently unusable. If you are buying these for body boarding, then I HIGHLY SUGGEST THAT YOU BUY CHURCHILLS OR ALLYS SWIM FINS. Another thing I noticed is that if you have somewhat wide feet, YOU WILL GET CRAMPS.Pro: Padded ankle strap for comfort, extra ankle support/tether, recommended for swimming only, small enough for travel.Con: Not a great ankle strap mechanism, not for body boarding."
1,not his best,"i would truly give this cd 1 1/2 stars but i can't. i can see where he was trying to go with this one musically, but it's just not happening. There are way better Capone cd's out there. don't waste your time on this one.Comes to a disappointment for me - cuz i own all his cd's, but not this one."
1,deserves to be in my trash bin not my cd shelf,"this cd is garbage...capone has no lyrical talent, no flow, no production, no nothing. He just plain ol sucks, he need to retire and go work 9-5 or somethin thats bout all hes good for."
1,What a SLEEPER!,This book started out with some promise and took a hard left to nowhere. The anacronistic space traveler has been used far too often. There were so many references to earth in the description of the alien world that the whole idea that this took place somewhere other than Washington state is hard to believe. The idea of 'killer mold' is pretty hard to swallow even for the most die-hard Treker. I was about half way through when I cut my loses.
3,"Fun read, well-written, nothing special.","This is a reasonably well-written, reasonably enjoyable Star Trek story. It has nothing to make it stand out from the large number of other stories that would fit that description, however. The plot is pretty standard fare, and is a pretty standard, off-the-shelf plot for a Star Trek story or even just a science fiction story in general. Nor does it blaze new trails in terms of character or background world, or give the reader anything to think about that hasn't been addressed in Star Trek many times before. If you enjoy the genre, you should enjoy it. If you don't, you won't."
3,Much potential; most of it unrealized,"This story starts out with a lot of potential--a 21st century ship discovered with her crew intact. Unfortunately, the focus then shifts to the planet Merope IV where the newfound crew will settle, and to some ""moss creature"" there. A great premise, but then the story goes in the wrong direction..."
2,Not worth it.,"It started out o.k., but The Attack of the Killer Bush? People being ""cradled"" by The Bush? It's just not worth the time and money."
2,Star Trek: Across The Universe (88),"As a fan of Star Trek I must say that this was one of the worst books I've ever read. I really like Star Trek books so that's a real hard statement for me to make. This book was just so dry, I mean I can understand that is might start out that way but this one never got any better. In fact I found that it got down right boring, two stars may even be a little to much to give this one."
2,its O...K....,the leather is bad quality and you can start to feel the wear and tear on the finger tips after about 30 minutes of usage.. works well.. but dont expect it to last forever..
5,Jame Dean - is there anything left to say?,Having known people who worked with James Dean (in early television) I thought I had heard all I could hear about his early career. Val Holley has written a compelling & believable account of Dean's life - this is the best of any of the books on Dean I have read (& I enjoyed having stories I had heard about Dean's early career confirmed). Very good read.
4,Fantasic except for one thing,"The one thing I took issue with in this book is the author's presentation of Jimmy and Pier's relationship.It has been proven time & time again that Jimmy and Pier were the loves of each others lives.They were driven apart by the old-fashioned restraints of her family. I will never understand why so many biographers and Dean fans insist on tearing down the relationship and disputing its meaning.Other than that it is a fascinating, detailed bio."
3,good for playing old games.,"A friend and I teamed up and got a Gamefly subscription and even though I'm paying half the price per month I'm thinking about canceling. I'm primarily an 360 gamer and Gamefly never has any of the games I want to play. Unlike Netflix, where everything is in stock, with Gamefly you're put into a waiting list for a new or popular game. I've had one game in my queue since I joined and the availability has not changed. I don't think I'll ever get it. If you want to go back and play older games that you missed, then GameFly is a good choice. If you're like me and think GameFly is going to have the new games readily available to play on release, you're more than likely going to be disappointed. meh..."
1,Samples are incorrect,"Hi, Amazon. Your samples of ""The Best of Lionel Hampton"" are hilariously incorrect. Listen for yourself - opera! Not bad, but definitely not hip."
1,Item not as pictured.,"The comb pictured is not the comb that was sent to me. I have thick hair and I will not be able to use the comb that was shipped to me, the comb teeth are too close together. The comb pictured has 17 teeth on the detangling side, the comb actually has 32. To make matters worse, the comb is not smooth, it is stiff and has a rough finish, so it gets stuck when combing my hair dry. I will be dontating it to Goodwill."
3,It is just what it is,"Yes, ""Here Comes The Grump"" is a silly, senseless maniacal cartoon of an unending chase but if you were a kid at the time it ran on television it is worth the sentimental value to order it and have a copy to watch every now and then just for the sake of memories."
4,Lots Of Fun,"I have been searching for this cartoon for many, many years. Though sadly the series ended before Princess Dawn could rescue her kingdom from the Grump's spell, I found the DVD collection to be a wonderful way to relive those halcyon days of childhood.Of course, the constant slapstick, especially the Grump's dealings with his allergy-suffering dragon, are what make the series fun.I admit the animation is not the best and they repeat a lot of cells (they must have saved a bundle by running the same scene over and over in different cartoons and just changing the dialogue), but the phantasmagorical characters and locations are great examples of the '60s psychedelic art motifs.And young kids will enjoy the series too."
4,Please bring out on DVD,"This outing from The Stepford Community was great. Barbara Eden was extremely good as the mother who notices that the children are not normal and is very surprised that they have no hang-outs, no weekend parties without parent supervision and no PTA. The ending is suspenseful and exciting more than any of the other have been. The way the children are being switched is different than the other times. In some ways the special effects were head of there time.I just wish is was available on DVD."
2,what happened,I want to know what happened here. You've got two of the coolest comic book characters (outside of Marvel): Batman and Spawn. This should have been great. But it was hampered with a weak story and minimal contact between our two superheros. Even the artwork wasn't that great. Come on guys--you could have done better.
2,Pathetic follow-up to a cool crossover story,"After the events of Batman/Spawn, it seems one of Spawn's enemies has been brought back from the dead and Spawn has strange visions which brings him to Gotham City in search for pieces of the puzzle of his missing life. Batman and Spawn fight yet again but team up as they have been noticing bodies fell and the dead are being brought back to life, they must deal with Croatoan who is an evil monster who works for Satan and has to stop him before Gotham is doomed.Very disappointed and disjointed follow-up to a rad crossover, DC and Image has screwed it up here and not to mention the writing by Chuck Dixon is bad. Spawn was pathetic in this story as was Batman with the artwork being terrible, i wish Todd Mcfarlane who always draws Spawn should have done this comic and should have had Frank Miller continue this sequel but nooo they screwed it up.Not recommended."
1,"Horrible, one of the worst comic books out there","This is a book that should have never come out. If you want to read a Batman story look into his many trade paperbacks and spawn has several too, just do not read this book, you will regret it if you do."
3,Too Hard for a Conure...Too Easy for a Cockatoo,"My poor little conure could not open this toy. Some have opined to me that conures are not the most clever, but she often shocks me with her creativity and resourcefulness. Consequently, I suspect the green levers are just too heavy for her to pull...she only weighs 73g. after all. Then, I gave it to the Goffin's Cockatoo. She likes it, but it is rather simple in her estimation...she opens it in a few seconds. To make it more interesting, I put shreddable toys on the inside. I will have to try this with the African Grey."
3,Looked ok for a bird but not for my sugar gliders,"NOT a good toy for sugar gliders. I can see this crushing a gliders hand,finger, arm etc. This is WAY TOO BIG and WAY TOO HEAVY for a sugar glider! Wish they had specified size/weight prior to my purchase. Now I'm spending 50% of what it cost me just to return it!I do think this would be good for a large bird though!"
2,Eager to find out more,"This was an okay book. I was eager to keep on reading, more so tyring to find the plot and point of the book and its characters."
2,On Her Way...,"The author is on her way, the question is WHEN will she arrive? Hopefully, with diligent work and guidance from someone already making it in the game, her raw talent will be perfected.I loved the sister girl tone the book was written in. It was that appeal that caused me and several other readers I have spoken with to keep reading, rather than tossin' it for kindling in our fireplaces.There are good story lines within the plot, however the tales are spun rather weakly and a few UNrealistic when speaking of a true sistah'!I wish Ms. Sanders well, because, hey she did try!"
2,No-Wire Walker Basket,"I was disappointed with the basket. After assembling the pieces, it did not look like the picture on the website. It is thin plastic pieces that snap together and was hard to assemble for me as I have hand arthritis. I would not have purchased it if I had known about this."
1,"Overpriced, chips easily",Most of Tracy Porters merchandise is over priced and lacking in quality. This piece Chipped right out of the box.
3,Rolfs Fan Card Wallet in black,"The wallet arrived in a timely manner, however, it was still a little too big, I wanted something smaller. The return was credited in a timely manner as well!"
3,Needs better photos,"I'm not actually reviewing the wallets, more stating that it is impossible from these photos to decide whether to buy the wallets or not. I would strongly recommend that amazon get better images."
3,Most of the Cast Bites at Least,"A small cast [Harold Cannon, Michael Kriz , Andrew Lamond, Joe Morrsey and Sharon Young] and a story with an intriguing premise, this movie was released about 1993. The only actor who could act his way out of a paper bag in this film is Michael Kriz. He had a lot of promise. I wonder what became of him?"
1,Beware!!!!!,Don't ever buy from this company! It has been over a month and I haven't heard anything from them. I cancelled this order but have not received confirmation and this order is still outstanding in my Amazon account. I am disgusted !!
2,not as promised,"The title does not reflect the real content of the book. This is, in effect, a detailed description of a successful grant in a low-income school system. It does not provide genuinely useful information about how to keep the arts in 21st century schools."
5,Very effective!!,"I rarely write reviews but i have to admit, these vitamins really do work...I am deployed and therefore was always in a stressful mood, once my friend suggested me to take a dose of them, i actually felt the stress fly away and became much more relaxed in every aspect....I took them since that time and still feel the effects, i did a huge amount of research to find any side effects but it seems that it is safer than anything else so i will continue therefore!!!!"
4,POWERFUL B-VITAMIN BOOST THAT IS EASY TO DIGEST,The combination of capsule and time-release make this vitamin a joy for anyone with a sensitive stomach.
1,Bogus shake charging,"As the reviewer said before, this is not a true shake flashlight. The wires from the coil go nowhere and the metal piece is not even weakly magnetized. It is simply a single LED with two coin cells. When those are discharged the unit has to be taken apart to replace them."
4,Excellent material,This is a very good book for those beginner-intermediate level chess players. I am very happy that I finally obtained it.
3,Expected a little more quality.,"For the price, I would expect a higher quality model. The unit I received had mismounted parts. The breast plate attachment hooks were not secured in the unit so it hangs too low thus not functional. Without this piece in place, the model organs don't stay in. When the model is sitting vertical, the eye that is removable doesn't stay in. Looks like I was shipped a unit that wasn't checked before it left the factory."
1,Actually ended up getting the wrong product shipped!!,I had ordered the Glass Menagerie and got the Dr Fausto or some book like that instead..Long time amazon user and this is the first time this has happened..was too lazy to followup on it but a disappointing experience none theless.
2,Not good for groceries,"I bought this bag to take to the grocery store, but it is not a ""flat bottom"" type bag, so you can only get so much in it. The bags are also smaller than I imagined."
4,nice comforter but looks different in person,The color is a bit darker when you first get it. Its more of a medium-dark brown and green. But its warm and comfortable.
4,Great but too soft,"Some time ago Smash Mouth was about to publish ""Old habits"" where they said they would return to their original rock style, but in the end Summer Girl appeared and I see that this spirit died. However I love this album and specially ""Girl like you"" and ""The crawl"" but with the original sound it would be better."
2,Winter Girl?,"I have awaited this CD with baited breath since it's forthcoming release was announced last January. It was heralded as a return to the Smash Mouth old, circa FYM.As it turns out, the press release was referring to another album the band had completed entitled Old Habits. After replacing their drummer and ditching Interscope as their label, they decided to release Summer Girl instead.This album has 1 very good track (So Insane), 3 decent tracks (The Crawl, Story of My Life, Right Side Wrong Bed) and 7 really crappy tracks.The bottom line is this: If you enjoyed Get the Picture, you might like this one as well. If your looking for the catchy, well written Smash Mouth of old, save your money."
3,Loving and Leaving the Good Life,Good read for those who wonder what their life is about and if they have accomplished anything.
4,Impressing....,"I'm a student of Yonsei University in Seoul, Korea. My major is pol.science. Somehow this book became the textbook of one of my courses, which is 'Politics appeared in Literature'. This book was quite nice and we had discussion after having read this. I guess most of students got impressed by Helan & Scott's whole life."
5,The Proud Predator,"This collection gives a look at the ""King of Beasts"" that is neither melodramatic nor overly romanticized. Lions have captured man's imagination for time immemorial. All the programs are pretty much even-handed, for these animals are predators. Still, there is something about the lion that is by turns admirable, repellant, fascinating, terrifying, and this collection is utterly absorbing.This was actually a gift for someone, and he was delighted with the quality of the trasfers.For someone truly interested in wildlife documentaries, this is a solid collection for the price."
1,Boxset incomplete,"I was supposed to receive four different dvds but I only received three. I did not receive ""the Lions of Gir"" and instead there was two copies of the ""Lions of Etosha"" in the boxset."
2,Too Complicated -- gadgets aren't as much fun as they used to be.,"I am a self admitted ""Gadget Guy"", but I had a hard time with this product. You need an advanced degree in engineering to set this watch up, or be 12 years old (too many functions that you will never use, press the button once for this function, press the button twice for this function, etc. etc, -- You get the point). If you are over 50 years old I would leave this product alone. Plus it is very heavy on your wrist. It is tough getting old, gadgets aren't as much fun as they used to be."
4,"Product great, Seller not so much","I love this watch - it is everything that I wanted, except that it is a bit thicker than I realized. Nevertheless, I am very pleased with it.The seller of the item, however, shipped it too slowly, despite my exacting instructions. However, the watch itself is beautiful and functions exactly as it is represented."
4,Good Modern Noir!,"I read Nothing Personal in about 4 hours on a plane ride home. I never expected to finish it so quickly, but, I couldn't stop turning the pages. Not only is this book very funny it is also deeply disturbing. Jason has a great way with dialect for making this feel like an edgy NY thriller."
1,Good Outline -- When will the book be ready?,"My reading group read Len Riley's outline for his story and we were encouraged by the first chapter that a book would follow. However, we were subjected to blatant name-dropping, superficial character development and an incomplete plot and sub-plots. It seemed as if we were reading the treatment for a movie-of-the-week. The moral of the story is: If the Harlem Renaissance was about Black artists coming into their own, let's not cheapen the history with poor renditions of the ""great"" novel."
2,Just didn't get going for me.,"I must admit I had mixed emotions about reading this book after reading a few of the customer reviews. After having finished it, I still have mixed emotions. I couldn't get into it. Too many plots were brought up and left incomplete or under developed. Overall, the story line reminded me of that loose thread that you can't seem to cut right. The more you pull on it, the more you unravel until eventually you just wished you never tried to trim (read it) in the first place.At best this was the typical country bumpkins go to the big city story. They fall on hard times, etc., etc. Once you've read one like it, you've read them all. Nothing new about this one I'm sorry to report."
4,Great as a lunchbox. Insulation could be better.,"I use this as a lunchbox. I can take three aluminum cans, a gel ice pack, and my lunch, and it all stays cool. It's easy to carry and clean.The insulation could be better... I also have an Igloo Maxcool (soft-sided, with a rigid liner and insulated padding) which insulates much better. This Coleman cooler keeps everything cool for about 5 hours. The larger Igloo keeps them cold about twice as long. But the Coleman is smaller and will last longer, and does keep things adequately cool.Knocked off one point because of the mediocre insulation, but otherwise am quite pleased with this."
3,Not cool.,"Sorry, but this is a purchase I regret. This lunchbox is small and does NOT keep contents cool. Found another lunchbox a size bigger for less money at Walmart. Wish I'd seen it first. I love to order from Amazon, but not this time."
5,Coleman Personal Cooler,This cooler works perfect for when I go to the beach by myself or when I am working out in the yard. Keeps the beverages cold for when I need them most. I am also a Tampa Real Estate Agent and this cooler is perfect to take several bottles of water for my clients and I during showings.
5,It's a cooler,"It's a cooler - it does what it's supposed to do, but was impossible to find in the local stores so I purchased here. Fits our needs nicely, will be buying more soon (not for personal use obviously) :)"
5,Love this cooler have bought them as gifts,This is a perfect little cooler Everyone that I have given one to loves it. The lid is attached so no lost lid
3,little bit smaller than i expect,this product was smaller than i expect.you actually need to see the size in the market before you buy it.only 2 small powerwades or 1 big powerwade fit in it.
1,Dont' buy if you only have a computer CD player,I bought this CD to import to my iPod it doesn't work. I buy lots of books on CD to transfer to the iPod and this is the only one that can't be read on my computer. their packaging had no mention of copy protection or what kind of player the CD works on. I assumed then that it would work anywhere. I was wrong and now it's just gathering dust. Useless.
2,Hold off,"This camera really had all of the potential in the world, but sadly, it hasn't lived up to my expectationsYes, when done under daylight, the pictures are beautiful ---- but the indoor and nighttime performance is what disappoints meThe flash is WAY TOO STRONG, thus overblowing many of the nighttime shotsIn addition, I often set my own aperatures with this camera, but in having a mind of its own, the camera will re-adjust the aperture, right as I take the shotughI love Sony products - but I recommend staying away from this one"
4,Oldie buy goldie. Fantastic image quality.,"This camera was released in 2004 so it's been eclipsed several times over in terms of megapixels and video quality. You know what? As long as you're not using it for video, you wouldn't know it's 8 years old. It's fast to start up, locks focus quickly, and most importantly, produces superb image quality. I'm sure sony's sensor has something to do with it, but I think the secret sauce is mostly in the incredible Carl Zeiss lens. In terms of sharpness this camera rivals my Nikon D80 with 50mm 1.8. It's that sharp. As other people have noted the battery life is terrible. I pack an extra and forget it's a problem. Buy this camera, you won't be disappointed."
3,Except Flash everything is good about this camera !!!,"I own this camera for 3 years now and I found that this camera has some real cool features. Photos are really good. The only problem with the camera is flash. If you ask somebody to take the photos, you have to particularly tell them not to put their fingure on the flash. Orelse, flash does not popup. Also, you cannot take pictures continously on flash because it takes some time for recharge. This is annoying me allot and I'm thinking of buying a Nikon camera because of this damn flash thing."
5,Great Pictures. Easy to learn.,This is my first digital camera. The pictures look fantastic.Right from the box I was taking better pictures than I haveever taken with any camera.WORTH EVERY PENNY !!
5,Excellent little camera,"The camera's not exactly pocket sized, but it is fairly small. It takes great pictures both indoors and outside. The macro is fairly good. Overall I would say that it's a great camera for an enthusiast.I, so far, have no complaints other than the proprietary battery and storage medium."
2,"Werewolf: Good in day, bad at night.","This camera:Good, overall. Functions are good, quite good quality. In daylight, the pictures turn out beautifully. (at night, its a nightmare.)Bad: bulky, Color difficulties, small LCD screen, ""Nightshot"" is a joke (weird black and whitish color texture that looks like youre seeing through night vision googles), too strong a flash."
4,"I Love this camera, but you need to read the small print","Up to yesterday I was not happy with the battery in this camera. I bought it in December of 2003 and by July of 2004 the battery would not take a charge. The second battery (at $70.00) charge up to a week before Christmas and then would not charge either. I read through the reviews yesterday looking for someone with a similar problem and found none. This sent me scratching my head back to the owners manual. What I found was a message in very small print on page 10 about cleaning the DC plug on the charger or your battery won't charge. I did, and they did! I now own two very fully charged batteries. My review yesterday was 4 stars for the camera and the 5th deleated for the bad batteries. I would now like to make my review a very happy 5 stars."
5,The ideal small prosumer digital camera,This is my 5th digital camera. I bought it because my Sony DSC-P9 never fullfill my need for a small camera that could produce profsional quality pictures. This Sony DSC-V1 is all I ever want from a digital camera. It small enough to carry around and the pictures quality it produce is second to none. I love it.
5,Excellent Camera!,"Aloha,This is a fantastic camera. I did months of research and was all set to buy the highly rated Canon G3. Caught wind that the G5 was soon to be released, thus delayed the purchase to see what the G5 offered. The day came, went to dpreview.com to read the G5 review. Stumbled across the Sony DSC-V1 review and knew right away, the Sony was the way to go for me.Why? One central reason. The Sony DSC-V1 takes just as good photographs, yet does it with an auto focus lag and shutter lag that is *twice* as fast as the G3/G5. The DSC-V1 is just like using a film camera, you hit the button, it takes the picture, with almost no lag.The DSC-V1 isn't perfect. Battery life is ho-hum, a second battery is a must. At first it wasn't comfortable in the hand because of the small size, yet I've since gotten used to it and it doesn't bother me anymore.All in all, I'm very very pleased with the Sony DSC-V1. It takes great photos and is plug and play on my PowerMac running 10.2.6.Highly Recommended!"
1,"Hate this camera, buying a new one asap!","So many little annoying things about this camera! Everytime anyone else takes a picture, I have to tell them not to put their finger on the flash which is placed in the worst place possible. Takes really bad indoor pictures. If the object (say kids)is even slightly moving the picture is soooooo blury! The flash takes so much time to recharge the by the time you want to take another picture the moments has come and gone! Thank goodness for photoshop because I am constantly ajusting the color quality, and red eye. It is so bulky compared to most cameras! The battery doesnt last more than 30 minutes. I would give this camera no stars but it wasn't an option! Don't waste your money. Buy a cannon!"
3,OVERRATED,"WAY overrated - Amazon reviews have certainly sold out. Nightshot is a joke - it's a black and white image - better off just using a flash. The aperture only goes down to F2.8, so forget about serious low light color photography with this camera (Cannon C3040 - a four year old camera goes down to F1.8). Like the other reviewer I had dead cells right out of the box (white and purple spots on the image). Day time photos look really great but in any light other then bright sun light the photos will blur. I wish the Carl Zeiss lens was on my old Cannon. Bottom line is this is another Camera crated by marketers and not photographers.Two because in perfect daylight conditions the Carl Zeiss lens really can produce a nice image."
2,Sony missed it on this camera,"I owned this camera for about 3 days. I returned it 2 reasons:1) The pop-up flash is located on the upper left-hand side of the camera where your index finger would normally go to hold the camera. This prevents the flash from popping up; to accomdate you end up holding the camera awkwardly.2) I couldn't find the ""Erase all images"" function. I think sony forget to add it. I couldn't find it in the manual either.I could have lived without the Erase all feature, but I just didn't like the way I had to hold the camera. It always felt like I was getting ready to drop it."
2,Translation does not match the Spanish text,"Overall, reasonably interesting stories for a beginner. The major issue is that the English translation does not match the Spanish text. It is as if two different people wrote the English and Spanish text and never read each other's work. The discrepancies range from different way of saying the same thing to omitting entire words that change the meaning of the sentence. This is not acceptable for what should be a learning tool At best it is confusing and at worse misleading. A number of the words are also not included in the vocabulary in the back of the book.At first I was marking up correcting the English translation in the book, but there was so much to correct that I quit and just let it go. Very annoying."
1,Eli Manning Jersey,"I ordered what I thought was an XL Eli Manning Jersey as a present for Christmas. The ad never stated it was a ""YOUTH"" sized jersey so it was of course too small when I received it. Customer service was friendly and replaced the jersey with the correct size, but I had to pay for packaging to ship it back as well as another $25 or so dollars difference for the larger jersey. I felt like it was false advertising not to include that it was a ""YOUTH"" size in the ad. The one star is for the customer service."
4,A must for die-hard Newbury fans!,"Unfortunately, for the true Newbury fans (from the early 1970's), you might find disappointment in some of the selections and re-creations on this CD. I love Mickey's words and his voice, but I yearn for the release of ANY of his earlier albums (of which I have all). The CD ""Best of Mickey Newbury"" is even better, as it captures his younger years and is more mellow, melodic and smoothy, unlike his ""Nights When I Am Sane"". I will be looking for this 8 CD Collection. I wish I could have the chance and opportunity to just shake his hand and say ""Thank You"" for his music."
5,"Wonderful, absolutely wonderful!!!!","I heard Mickey on the radio on a trip. I thank the radio station who played him. It took persistence, but I finally found this CD. Please tell me there are more out there someplace. I just sit and let the music enter my pores and enjoy."
5,A master poet/coposer/musician/singer - great sensitivity!,"""Nights When I Am Sane"" reflects the consistancy of this man's depth. As a poet/composer and a musician/singer, his skills and his insights into the ""human condition"" eclipse most others. But where has he been? I read a newspaper article a few years ago that characterized him as somewhat of a recluse - said that he was living 'way back in the mountains of Idaho. I wrote to him, asking if he knew of a source where I could purchase his past recordings, but never received an answer. I wish he would record more, and have his past works re-released. I'd like for other music lovers to see (hear) what I mean when I mention him as one of the great ones!"
2,This is a poor representation of Newberry's work!,Curb Records has not even the slightest clue nor access to what represents the best of Mickey Newberry. Look for the (8)CD box set called the Mickey Newberry Collection instead. Hopefully Amazon will have it available at a reasonable price in the near future.
1,Worst of his albums - but wonderful sense of humor about it,"I've been looking for my 2 favorite Newbury lps for a long time now (After All These Years and His Eye is on the Sparrow) - beautiful, serene voice and compositions. Since they weren't available, I got this one a couple years ago. I wrote, ""Simply terrible! Pieces, arrangements, voice and delivery bad."" In my annual search this year, I came across his comments about this lp. What a wonderful sense of humor! How nice to know he doesn't take himself too seriously. Wish he could get somebody to release the two lps above on cd's."
1,This is not Mickey's best,This CD is far down the list of what any fan of Mickey's is looking for. If you would like Mickey's website contact me at: randec@earthlink.net. You're in for a treat!
1,Whatever Happened to Mickey?,"Boy, is this a disappointing CD! Mickey Newbury in the 1970's was one of the most moving and effective folk balladeers of his time. He wrote ""Heaven Help the Child"" ""Sunshine"" and did a tremendous version of ""An American Trilogy."" None of those 70's CDs are available, so I was thrilled when I saw ""Nights When I Am Sane"" released. Boy, what a disappointment! It's a live recording with Mickey and a couple of guitars. Even the brilliant 'Heaven Help the Child"" sounds ineffective. What a shame! Maybe Elektra records should release Mickey's older CDs and people who haven't heard him could hear him at his best. Don't waste your money on this one!"
1,Lost Christmas Gift,"The product I ordered for a Christmas present on 12/08/06 never arrived to the recipient, and I was never informed that it had not been sent. It was only after I received a thank you note from the recipient In January, thanking me for another gift but not mentioning the item in question, that I knew that she had not received the gift. When I inquired of Amazon what had happened to the item, I did not get a reply, but I did see on line that my money for the item was being refunded - no further explanation and no offer to try to send the gift. Not a good experience!"
2,Baring All in Barntrosna,"From behind the shield of his narrative's narrator, Phildy Hackball, Patrick McCabe hazards forth once again to peel away the myths we'd still like to believe about Ireland and about human beings. It's the sort of expose he's done before, masterfully, in the Butcher Boy and again in The Dead School. Unfortunately, for this reader, Mondo Desperado lacks the narrative focus, depth of insight, and most importantly, any shred of sympathy for the human curiosities on display. By telling his tales through an eccentric narrator, McCabe allows his own eccentric voice too much free rein. The lack of discipline is telling: the verbal riffs are not as sharp, the flashes of embarassing insight not so difficult to ignore. Ultimately the humour, black as ever with McCabe, fails to be funny because the pillory is overcrowded. Barntrosna becomes little more than a roadside attraction; the serial of stories a sort of ""Failte Isteach"" in a funhouse mirror. I failed to find the fun though."
5,Excellent coverage of important issues,"This book is the product of an important conference held to debate current legal and ethical issues in art repatriation/restitution. All of the authors are at the forefront of their fields and present clear and readable overviews of the legality of the cases. Both sides are represented (for instance, for and against the repatriation of the Elgin Marbles). An excellent and interesting read; a necessity for people working in this area."
1,Must be run as administrator,"After installing this program and testing it on my account, I tried to run it from my son's more limited account. It doesn't work. After a little investigation, fiddling with permissions, file access, etc., I finally contacted ""technical support"". They said flatly ""The product was meant to run on an administrator account only."" Hopefully your child will not destroy your operating system with a few misguided mouse clicks."
1,Software Flop,I purchased this software to use with my younger kids. It was not at all what it was advertised as. I tried to use the software but not much of it worked like it was supporsed to. It was a waste of my money!
2,too small for mailbox,"My fault, as the size is indicated, but... it's hard to judge without seeing it for yourself. If you want these for putting your address on a mailbox, they're too small."
2,"Ethanol Guide is 24 years old, much content is out of date","This book is far too old to be of much value today. But, because there are so few books on this topic, and because virtually all of the others also are over-priced, ""A Guide to Commercial-Scale Ethanol Production and Financing"" is worth considering for the person who wants a comprehensive library on ethanol.However, the 2002 copyright date is very misleading: This is a reprint of the 1981 edition. This is not a revision or update. It is word-for-word from the 1981 edition and this should be made clear to buyers before they purchase the book.The field of renewable energy is dynamic. Changes in technology alone have made this 24-year-old book virtually obsolete, not to mention dramatic changes in politics and economics that have made major portions of the book seem quaint if not laughable."
1,Norpro Apple Mate is a Lemon,Took it out of the box this morning and went to work on some apples....it lasted until the EIGHTH apple and broke. The prong stripped off and literally fell off. It is a flimsy piece of junk. Shame on Norpro. The clamp mechanism is flimsy and does not secure the body of the peeler well either. I am disgusted.
1,DO NOT BUY,"When the Norpro Apple Mate arrived it was already broken, where the 3 prong fork attaches to the shaft the threads on the shaft were stripped. I had a old apple peeler but one of the forks was broken off so I used the fork on my old one so it wasn't a total loss. I would not recommed this to anyone."
1,"Doesn't work, no support","I attached the boomcube to my pc, the cube did not automatically turn on. when I turned it on manually, it appeared to go into usb mode, but it never had the graphic that it was connected. When my pc noticed the connection it could not find a driver and cannot identify the mp3 player.When I call customer support, I get a recorded message saying nobody is available, when I try to submit a form on their website it does not apply my information. At least it is small so it won't take up a lot of space in my junk drawer."
2,Wimp of honor,"The main character 'Andy' sounds like he is about 11 or 12 years old, while all his friends seem to be teenagers in the high school age range. What gives? Why the difference in age / maturity? I will not be buying any more Net Force books."
4,Great camera!,"Considering I'm one that avoids reading instructions first...I found this camera idea for me. However, I was so impressed with the quality of picture, and easy of auto operation, that I started reading. This camera has a world of features, and offers a lot of fun. I highly recommend it."
1,Dont waste your money,This camera is laughably bad. i had an Olympus and literally wore it out. I was then reluctantly talked into this piece of garbage. The pictures are dark and blurry. As a digital camera enthusiast i truly hate this camera and am out $300 on it.
4,Sony DSCP92 Cyber-shot 5MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom,Sony DSCP92 Cyber-shot 5MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom: Good product that works as advertised. I would recommend to others.
2,Not very clear,"We bought this camera b/c we had thought Sony was a very good product. This camera took awful pictures. They quality was very blurry. We called Sony and they had us on the phone trying to fix it. We were told we would have to hold the camera a certain way (which we tried) and listen for the beep (which we tried) Finally after taking about 15 pictures and having about 3 come out clear, we packed it up and returned it for a cheaper Olympus, that takes great pictures!"
3,small and handy but not as sharp as fuji,I was having 2 options when buying digi cam fujifilm finepix 3800(now 3000) or Sony dscp 92I bought dscp92 becs of high pixel range 5mp against fuji's 3.2mp and small size but after comparing its result with Fuji I m really disappointed. I think Fuji's finepix technology is best for better color quality and sharpness. (6X zoom and 4 battery power is bonus!!) I was lucky I bought it form C'city so I can go back within a month and gat it change or return it!! ;)for those who are high pixel rage maniac(like me)- high pixel doesn't affect ur picture quality if u wanna take normal postcard size prints it will help u to just take big copy and 3.2 range is good enough for around 10X12 inch picture.never buy HP digi cam i bough 1 from Amazon and return it in 2 days becs of poooooooor picture quality(Sony is not so bad)-----UPDATE: actually i returned this and bought another one see all my reviews--------
3,Defect,"We bought this model new at Staples which was our first mistake. We also bought an extended warranty through Staples which was our second mistake. This camera took good pictures until it starting humming after less than a year of use. Turns out there is something wrong with the shutter and the total bill is $375. Staples will not pay to get it fixed even under their extended warranty. They are cutting us a check for the purchase price but will not refund the $50 for the warranty or the $25 deposit I paid to get it fixed. Bottom line, probably a decent camera but never buy a camera or extended warranty at staples."
5,You gotta have this camera,"If you love photography, if you like digital imaging, if you like making fun MPEGs, and if you enjoy shooting high quality pictures, then you gotta have this camera. I have never seen such an easy-to-use camera. Like with most Sony digital cameras, the DSC-P92's user-friendliness and image and lens quality are what it's all about. Having family living all around the world, it is also great fun to make short MPEGs and send them through e-mail."
2,Sticky Lens Cover,My Sony DSCP92 takes great pictures in full light and fair pictures in low light situations. The only problem I have encountered is a sticky lens cover that does not alwys close or open properly. The camera is 2 years old.
4,Great camera & Awesome pictures,"I picked the DSC-P92 because of the quality of the pictures,size of camera & affordability.This things takes awesome pictures.Ease to handle and easy to use.Only drawback is the memory stick they include but no big deal,I purchased the 128 memory stick and will purchase another soon.Once you start taking pictures you don't wanna stop.I have a 35 millimeter but in order to email pictures you have to have them developed and then scanned,with the digital you just shot,load to computer and email,all within a matter of a couple of minutes.Thanks Sony for creating another fine product."
1,"VERY fragile LCD, terrible customer service","My wife bought me this camera for Christmas. After taking a few shots, I dropped the camera in a padded case about four feet to a carpeted floor. The minimal impact caused the LCD display to malfunction. The problem was not covered by either the store's extended service plan or the Sony warranty. Sony wanted more then the cost of the new camera to repair it!! One of their customer service representatives actually told my wife to ""treat the camera like you would a TV!"" Well, I typically don't take my TV skiing, hiking or boating with me! Poor product, poor organization, poor customer service. I will never buy a Sony product again!"
1,crap,"pros: sizecons: double exposuresblurry shotsthe flash works sometimesthe picture takes about 3 seconds to actually be capturedI have a kodak 2mp camera from about 5 yrs ago-and the shutter is much quicker. I use the camera purely for snap shots of my kids-and I cant have a 2 yr old ""hold on"" while I wait for the camera to focus. I was very disapointed in this camera-especially after seeing all the great reviews."
2,Blurry,"I tried out a number of 5 mp digital cameras and this was the worst by far. I couldn't get a decent picture whether it was scenery, portrait or whatever, every picture was blurry. I really thought Sony would have better quality control than this."
2,What ever happened to customer service?,"I used to buy a lot of Sony products but this camera has put an end to that practice. I could go into details of my customer service nightmare with Sony but I think I'll focus on the product itself. The camera produces an average picture but my Kodak DC 200 had better quality and it was less megapixels. The camera started shooting blue hued pictures when taken around dusk. Later, it began doing it all the time. I use Adobe Elements to correct Sony's failures but I am just going to purchace another camera. Close ups were never very crisp either. I would send it into Sony for repair but they jacked their flat rate price up from $117.00 to $171.00. Ridiculous, nobodys inflation rate is that high. To repair it and pay for shipping, I might as well go purchase a new camera."
3,"It's entertaining, but not a faithful retelling of the book","Both my preschooler and I enjoyed the book ""Stellaluna"" and when we came across this MGM produced DVD of the story, we were quite excited to check it out. Upon watching it however, we both realized that this DVD version is very different from the original story with many embellishments and introduction of new characters. Despite that, my 4-year-old daughter enjoyed this movie - the animation in quite well done and the little bat Stellaluna looks adorable. We both didn't much care for the songs in this movie [which come with the options of turning it on or off for sing-along].Conclusion - this adaptation will offend purists with its Hollywood approach to the story [well, the book is relatively short, and this show runs about 41 minutes]. However, if you're ok with a less than faithful adaptation purely for entertainment purposes, this DVD just might fit the bill."
3,Well...,"My kid was psyched to find this DVD, since they read this story at her school all the time. And I think she liked the adaptation okay; it's not much worse than other modern kid's cartoons. The thing to know about this ""Stellaluna"" cartoon is that the music is absolutely AWFUL. Just dreadfully, utterly, completely tacky and bad. If having your kid not hear terrible music, avoid this one. If you don't really care, I guess it's okay. Very sub-Disney, similarly formulaic, but not as good. (Axton)"
5,Think we've watched it a couple dozen times already,My son loves this DVD. He got hooked on the book in preschool and we thought he'd love the movie too. We were right!!! He loves singing along with Stellaluna and also checking out the bonus features. Wonderful story and great quality DVD.
2,"Good book, BAD movie adaptation","Apart from the content directly taken from the book, this movie is confusing, jumbled and misguided. If you just want to plop your kids down in front of some DVD, regardless of the quality of content, then this is the movie for you.I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 because it did, in fact, make my 4 and 6 year olds laugh a couple times and get scared in the scary parts, but I had trouble watching the whole thing because half the time my eyes were rolled so far back into my head (when they weren't sharing disbelieving looks with my wife). The music and voice casting were nice, but the plot was illogical and wandering and the song lyrics unfocused and forced.Just read the book. If you want a magical DVD for kids, get My Neighbor Totoro."
1,Ruins book - uninspired movie,"We love the Stellaluna book and this DVD completely veers from the tone and warmth of the book's story. It was a major disappointment. The movie guts the story, introduces the baby birds as snarky, adds terrible characters (a spider that wants to be a superhero and some tropical birds who want to make Stellaluna into something she's not) and has completely unneccessary ""scary"" parts. I say scary with some qualifications - our kids are sensitive to such things and many of our friend's kids would not find this scary. It also has the owl continually threatening to eat/harm the baby birds and Stellaluna as a subplot. This movie is not worth anyone's time. There are so many movies that are much better."
4,the hangars work pretty well -,"they could extend on the top a little more to ease the connection when you put the screen etc on the hook part.Unfortunately, the Slide-Co Company's delivery is truly sub-par. It took WEEKS to get them and after informing them that I had cancelled the order when I had not received them 2 weeks later, thats when the sent them, even tho they had sent me confirmation that they had sent them weeks before.Its important that people understand that this is a fact. I needed these immediately and if I had known it would take weeks, I would not have ordered them.Lance MichaelisPrime Building Solutions LLC"
5,Candid Chronicles of Southeast Asia,"This book is unique because of its candor and descriptions of the many meaningful and somtimes dangerous experiences of the author during his 12 years in Laos. Interspersed is an understanding of Lao attitudes and culture as well as reasons for some American failures. Howard Lewin's greatest strength and weakness was his unwillingness to accept incompetence, dishonesty and shoddy performances on the part of some Americans. Also described is the work of those Americans and Lao who risked their lives in the face of danger and adversity. This book contains lots of lessons for working in third world cross cultural situations."
3,"Nice book with great photos, but rather biased historically.","A nice little book. Great photos, however, when compared to contemporary commentaries by person's whom actually knew the Empress this book seems a bit biased toward the ""official"" and ""political"" interpretation of Sissi's life, personality and problems. I have kept it for the lovely photos. I prefer to garner a less biased history from a myriad of other sources."
5,An AMAZING Bang for the buck!!!!,"I am 27 years old and recently decided to purchase this set for myself as I used to play with LEGOs when I was a child. For 6.99, you canNOT go wrong!! There are a total of 65 pieces as well as a killer instruction manual that shows you how to build 3 models step-by-step, with pictures that can inspire additional building. The pieces come in it's own ""pod"" that can also be used to create models. I have owned this toy for a week and have already created 5-10 completely different models. It has helped me in my creative writing and music composition immensely. I highly recommend this toy for children as it certainly helps the creative process...or even for adults who need a healthy stress relief!!!"
4,Chances are ...,"Just the kind of book for the circle of literate-minded scholars who discuss rondels and rondeaus. Better chances are you are not one of them, but have a friend or relative behind bars. In the slammer. The joint. Even better chances are you know someone or at least of someone who is. Chances are you know what kind of person is in prison, why and how life is for someone inside. Better chances you have that information from mainstream TV, magazines and novels. This paperback is no easy read, no pleasant distraction. It's tough and edgy and dirty and disturbing. And, most important, it avoids the pitfalls, the cliches, the sensationalism, the big headlines. It sounds real, credible. Chances are it's well worth reading if the subject matter is for you - for whatever reason. And unlike with prisoners, no one will ask you what your reason is, or deny you the right to read it."
5,I laughed a thousand times.,Not at every line-- some of the pieces are a bit arcane. But some are a real scream. Everyone should buy this book for the colophon alone. Bruce McCall is a genius. It's amazing that he can paint too.
3,"Close, but no cigar.","Love The New Yorker Shouts and Mirmurs section, so what better than the book? A few gems in this read, but not as many as its sequel."
4,A collection from the summit of dry wit,"It's difficult to review humor in the first place, since it's so subjective, and it's equally difficult to talk about an anthology -- so this book, with 139 pieces by dozens of contributors, makes me throw my hands up. It's got fine work from all of the people you would expect -- from E.B. White and Dorothy Parker to S.J. Perelman and Robert Benchley, from Woody Allen and James Thurber to Ian Frazier and Calvin Trillin -- divided into a handful of archly-titled categories, like ""The Writing Life"" and ""The Frenzy of Renown."" It's definitely not a book to read straight through, but it is a vital book for anyone interested in the strain of literate, elite humor that The New Yorker embodied in the 20th century."
2,poorly manufactured,"I purchased four of these 3/4 inch mandrels from this seller. On three of the four the rubber drum was bored off center and were unusable. It took the seller over two weeks to acknowledge my complaint, it's been another two weeks and they have made no efforts to resolve this problem. You'd be taking a big risk buying from this seller as it appears they care very little about customer satisfaction."
3,Good Coverage of What Can Be Done With Hypnosis Clinically,"This book is a current classic in the area of scholarly hypnosis. It goes over quite a few different types of cases and demonstrates how hypnosis can be effectively applied to things as varied as eating disorders to smoking cessation, etc. It can get a bit monotonous, but it's a scholarly book, so what can your really expect.My only gripe isn't really this book, but the fact that I don't think it has much legitimate competition out there. Few books on hypnosis really go into good sound research on application in clinical settings. So, by default, the book is a classic. I'd like to see more books out there give it a run for its money."
3,Simple Beginner's Book,"This is a book with very simple conceptualizations of the human experience. It is an excellent book for enthusiastic young students, although it leaves much to be desired for the experienced practitioner."
1,Overpriced nonsense,"The claims about this product are complete nonsense and its price is absurd. There are many 48"" x 6"" ethafoam target mats on the market for less than $200. Only a fool would buy this for over $400."
5,Good purchase,We purchased this for my sister who was graduation nursing school. She really liked it. It seemed like it was well-made and more expensive than what we paid for it.
5,Great purchase at a great price!,"This is a great find! I bought five of these bracelets to give as gifts to some very special nurses in my life and one for myself. I loved them! They are beautiful! I love the blue beads, since blue is my favorite color. Sure the bracelet is not made out of silver, but it is still absolutely beautiful. I realize that some people have bigger wrists, but mine fit perfectly. I didn't even bother to undue the clasp as it slipped right on. I would definitely recommend this bracelet as a little something for that special nurse or new nurse in your life.These are excellent nursing school graduation presents! I am going to buy more for my other coworkers since the price is excellent. The price has gone up a little since I ordered initially but it is still not bad; under $7."
3,okay,"this item is pretty, and the box it comes it is even better with its satin touch and all, but the thing that bugged me the most was, the clasp, it keeped on undoing and falling off most of the time!"
2,Not as described,"The item was not as described, I was very unhappy with it. Although, I did return the item and get a full refund. It felt as though the item was made of cheap plastic beads, none if it was even silver, it was the faux painted on silver beads."
4,nurse bracelet,Purchased for a friend's daughter who is going to nursing school - she loves it! Very nice piece for the price. Comes in a cute blue box with silver ribbon. I would recommend this bracelet.
4,Purchased as a gift,I bought this for a nurse and she loved it. I thought it was a little youngish for an adult but not too bad.
5,Beautiful & Excellent Value,"This is a sweet little bracelet and beautiful! I do beading and the price is better than I could have done making it myself (even if I had the time). We gave this as a Christmas gift to our school nurse and she was overwhelmed by it's beauty and uniqueness. I can't comment on the size (some other reviewers felt it small) our nurse is an average woman, maybe trim - but the bracelet fit her perfect... she was so thrilled by it she asked me to help her put it on right away and she wore it throughout that day. This bracelet also came in a beautiful little gift box that got almost as many compliments as the bracelet itself. I highly recommend this and would buy it again for another nurse! (if I new one)"
3,A little small & cheap-looking,"I like the idea of the bracelet and when on, it is somewhat cute. But, it is cheap looking and doesnt stretch or have any flexibility. It is a little over-priced for the quality if you ask me. It fits me but it wouldn't fix someone larger than me (and im 185!)"
4,"Good info, Some things missing","This book has excellent information on a large number of trails in the Mountain State. The descriptions are detailed and, on the trails I followed, are very accurate. However, little attention is paid to summit data such as elevations, directions for side trips to reach summits, etc. As a person who is interested in ""peak bagging"", I was somewhat disappointed. There are about 173 summits in West Virginia over 4,000 feet and there is almost no reference to this attribute. This book is essential and has a tremendous amount of useful information, but does not go far enough."
3,West Virginia Hiking Trails,"WV Hiking Trails is not the first book by Allen deHart that I have read, and it certainly is not his best. Allen can describe a trail or a patch of forest with the best, there is no argument. This book is no exception. Where WV hiking trails misses the mark is the hasty organizing of the maps section. The trail descriptions do not refer you to the specific map(s) for the trail. This leads you to backtrack through the book searching for the right map for the trail you are reading about. This can be a real problem if using the map to find a trail head. The maps are also too small to use as trail maps or highway maps. My belief that this edition was put together in a rush and the editors didn't spend enough time reviewing the maps section. I suggest you buy his Hiking Guide to the Monongahela National Forest instead."
1,Good if you are a Park ranger,"I find the organization of this book very poor. Monongahela Forest is divided by Ranger Stations. It would be more helpful if it were organized by county or region, rather than technical designations (State forest, County park, etc.). It is not for the casual hiker at all."
4,Mahogony Bliss,"Anyone who loves classic wooden boats - and even anyone who doesn't - will find this photographically stunning book a joy to open. And have trouble putting down once they have.That's how beautiful Duncan's full-color images are, and how easy-going they'll find the text. Its brevity and light touch leave the reader wanting to know more. And see more of Duncan's compelling photographs of boats old and new that almost defy description in their pursuit of aethetic - and mechanical - perfection.It's a perfect gift for any boat lover in need or not. Think Christmas, think birthday, think any empty coffee table. Treat yourself. The very beauty of such hand-crafted masterpieces is an indulgence worth enjoying any time."
1,Item not to be sold....,Item not to be sold -it was a free promotion item. I paid $17 Canadian for it!
4,charming,"I was given a copy of this book years ago and loved it. I loaned it and never saw it again and have missed it ever since. It is charming, inspiring and makes me want to be more appreciative of what is around me always. It would make a perfect gift."
5,music,"had been looking for this song a long time amazon came in handy don,t ever go away.will let other no where to look for music."
3,Mi primer libro de jardinería,"My rating is middle because I did not read this book. However, after receiving it, I realized that it must be a children's book!"
3,Early Dolly TV Show Not Bad/Not Great,"Let's start with the good stuff. First of all it's great to actually see some of her first TV show surface on DVD. And there are some very good performances from Dolly and all of her friends. If you didn't get to see these when they were originally aired and you're a Dolly fan you're in for a treat. Now for the bad part, these are edited musical performances mostly. I think there is maybe one skit from the show actually on the dvds. Basically the format is Dolly's entrance to the show with a song, then she introduces her guest, the guest performs a song, then usually there's a Dolly number then she teams up with the guest for a song then it's Bye Bye. I really would LOVE to have seen this collection actually use the ENTIRE broadcast the way it was originally aired. If you're a Dolly Parton Fanatic like I am, it's definitely worth the money, if you're just a casual fan or a fan of one of her guests you might want to reconsider your purchase."
5,Not Just for Dolly Parton Fans,"I can give this DVD 5 stars even before viewing it because I taped every one of Dolly's 1976-77 shows on my trusty ol' Betamax and played them over and over until that Betamax eventually croaked. In fact, I'd happily pay the asking price for this DVD just for the show that featured Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt. For those who've already heard their soaring harmonies on their two ""Trio"" CD's, you already know you're in for a treat but hearing Dolly, Emmylou and Linda do ""The Sweetest Gift"" is guaranteed to give you goose bumps. The other guests featured on this CD are also fine choices and highlight Dolly's ability to effortlessly slip into any musical style. I've been waiting YEARS for Dolly's 1970's TV show to be released on DVD ... here's hoping this DVD is just the first in a series!"
4,Dolly shines,"I have loved Dolly's 1987 variety show since I was a child. I had never seen this one though (from the 1970's), and as a huge Dolly fan I purchased it as soon as it was available. I found a lot of the musical numbers to be corny and over the top. Dolly always shines though. She's best when she's herself, and when her guests are people that she clicks with. I felt that the standout episodes on this set were the episode with Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt and the episode with Kenny Rogers.That being said, I think this set has something for a lot of people. The guests are an eclectic bunch, but the shows are entertaining. Dolly is adorable, and you can tell that she's on the verge of superstardom while you watch this set. It's just too bad MPI didn't go ahead and release the whole series (since it was just one season)."
5,Charming!,"What a nice surprise. I love to buy concert/video/music DVD's and was on the prowl again for something new. Although I love Dolly, this was a ""What the heck.."" kind of purchase. I'm so glad I bought it. The guests each do several, well chosen, songs with Dolly, and you also get Dolly covering some songs of the times. I would compare the production values to a Welk type show (with less of a supporting cast) but still wonderful and fun to watch."
1,What a Disappointment,"How could Dolly Parton ever go wrong? Seeing is believing. Hokie, no energy, and she gets away with a product like this? You will be disappointed no matter how big a fan you are!"
5,A wonderful book for children!,"We got this book for our daughter when she was three. Now that she is four, she continues to love the stories in this trilogy and asks for them every night before bed. They are wonderfully written and short (a page or two), making them well suited for an evening bedtime story."
5,Tiptoes is a favorite,We love Tiptoes and her friends soooo much. A really NICE choice. Nothing evil or diabolical going on just a nice book for children!
5,We love Tiptoes!,"My four year old daughter loves Tiptoes (and so do I). Charming, magical stories -- we will be buying more Tiptoes books very soon!"
5,Lovely & Sweet,"This book is so lovely and sweet and simple. I have a preschooler and she loves the adventures and sweet lessons of Tiptoes and her friends.Perfect bedtime reading, short vignettes beautifully written."
5,"Yes, this is the same book","Yes, this is the same book published in hardcover as ""Athanasius and the Politics of Asceticism,"" from Oxford. I appreciate changing the title, because some chapters aren't as much about politics."
5,Masterpiece,This book covers most aspects relating to ortopaedic biomechanics. It is a most useful reference to all orthopaedic surgeon and biomechanical researchers. I have no doubt that this book should be in the library of every professions allied to orthopaedic surgery and biomechanics.
3,chock full of information but dry,This book is full of lots of technical information regarding biomechanics. Some sections are quite dry and there are not a lot of clinical examples. The book would be great for those interested into the physics behind biomechanics.
4,Collectors find use for Datigs Books,"Cartridges for Collectors, Volume 1, 2 and 3 is a very detailed and informative book on cartridges for the collector. There is much information in an easy to read format. However, many of the cartridges are experimental Swiss and other one of a kind European Cartridges. There is also plenty of info between the 3 volumes on American Centerfire, rimfire and military cartridges. It is a useful tool for some hard to find cartridges."
5,amazing!,This is one of the best translations of a traditional Tibetan text on emptiness available today.I highly recommend it to anyone who is serious about Tibetan Madhyamaka.
2,free audio downloads are by a computer generated voice,"I have never met a Que book I didn't like...until I bought this one. If you don't need the audio support, by all means get this book. The book is a great, fun introduction to conversational Spanish in an easy to read format. But, if you need the audio support, choose another title. The audio support is not a real person reading the text. It is a synthetic, computer generated voice. It is interesting to listen to but I needed practice in speaking and oral comprehension and a Latin computer voice just can't convey the ebb and flow, the pitch and tone of the language. What a shame. This book would deserve 5 stars if a real person had been hired to perform the audio. I took off 3 stars because the audio clips are promoted page after page throughout the book and nowhere does the author tell us that the audio clips are not an authentic human."
5,This is a great camera,"This a great camera! We purchased it three months ago and have not had one problem. It is easy to use, the cd's are wonderful, and the screen lets you see your pictures clearly."
1,dont by book from here used at usf is $107,They are charging tooo much for the books. By from school or different website before you by. Usf is only charging $107 used. If u want to save money than this is not a good purchase; maybe if u by it full price but if not by it from your school.
4,educational pschology book,"I would have appreciated more description about the book. The book was in good shape. The book looked a little more used then I thought it would be before I bought it. The book came fairly quickly, and I am very pleased with my purchase."
3,It's a Textbook,"This textbook, like so many other education textbooks, is heavy on the theory part and light on the practice part."
2,"Required, of medium quality","This book was required for a course I took. It was of moderate quality. Not the best textbook, not the worst."
2,Got the wrong book,I ordered the right book but I was shipped the wrong one. It was the same title but wrong author. I wasn't sure how to return it so I sent it to the person who sent it to me to see if they could send me the correct book.
2,Seller was innacurate,I purchased this text from an online seller and was very disappointed to find that its condition was greatly misrepresented. The discription was of a book that was virtually pristine in condition with NO marking. Instead I got a book that looks like it was attacked by a three year old with a highlighter. It was my intention to keep this book for my professional library instead I will spend twice the money to replace it.
5,"A great book, even when one's required to buy it","I had to buy this book for one of my university's special education credential classes, but the book's a definite keeper. I find that I learned more about what I need to know to do my job from this one textbook than from all my other textbooks combined. At least that's what it seems like most days!"
3,Length of time was too long,"I am glad that this company sent me the right product because i made another order of the same product with a different company but they sent me the wrong item. Anyways, i just think that it took an extremely long amount of time to arrive."
4,Required,"Had to get this book for a class. This book has great information, but can at times be quite slow and uninteresting to read."
5,emu oil,I bought this for my husband. He had a plantars wart on the bottom of his foot that was removed but became a callus that gave him pain. Emu oil is the first thing that softened it and it is better than it has ever been and he had suffered with it for years.
3,hit or miss,"I recently bought two bottles of the Emu oil for my Dad and a friend of his. They are both seniors and suffer from arthritis and the stiffening of the joints. The verdict is a mixed one. My dad claims there is no difference whereas his buddy is raving about the product claiming his bowling scores have improved due to the increase in flexibility he has. I think this confirms what I have always felt that holistic methods of healing react to the persona of the person as well as the discomfort. But because of the lack of side effects, I have always felt the effort to try alternative methods should always be considered."
5,emu oil,It is an awesome moisturizing oil. I absolutely love it. I recommend it for mature skin and any skin irritation. It is quite soothing.
2,weird texture,"I have been using emu oil for over a year, and decided to try a new brand to compare the difference in quality/texture. I had just finished my bottle of a different brand, and needed more to supplement my skin care while doing a chemical facial peel. When this came in the mail it had a weird chunky texture (it is supposed to be smooth and odor free). There is no funny odor, but I will return this product because of the chunky/gritty consistancy."
5,Emu Oil On Trial,"Hi all, I just finished a one-month trial of emu oil on my 4 year old daughter's eczema (her arm which gets it the worst). I ordered it online, from Longview Farms. It was pricey, $25/4 oz. I can say that it didn't help right away, but after four weeks her arm has almost completely cleared up! I put photos on my blog here if you want to see for yourself:[...]"
2,Little bit of turkey grease oder,It soaks into skin well. But when I put it on my hair I did not like the turkey grease oder. I will continue to combine it with other cosmetic oils and add a pleasant scent.Made in USA!
5,this is the most valuable healing oil in the world!,I suffered third degree burns on my leg from some hot water I was boiling. The pain was undiscribable. My leg looked like hamburger. My husband and I both started to do Reiki on it and he introduced me quickly to Emu oil. I put it on the wound directly 4 times a day and within 2 weeks it was nearly gone and in 4 weeks it was completely gone and NO SCAR!!! All this - without going to the hospital or to my physicain. I think everyone should have this oil in the house at all times. I use it on everything - even my dog - for her dry skin. Its great!!!
1,Bogus book,"Bogus book written by someone who has never seen the Eddie Eagle program. If you see a gun...Stop! Don't touch! Leave the area! Tell an adult! That is the Eddie Eagle message. Over and over again. Books like this are a lie, written to promote a gun control/anti-gun message, and to malign the NRA. Go NRA!!!!"
3,I'm not sure we were ready for this even yet!,"A novel idea. Professor Moriarty's daughter creates the first atomic device using uranium that is mutating rats (hence the Giant Rat of Sumatra) in Sumatra, partially with the blessing of Mycroft (who IS, you may recall, The British Government) and with the unwanted assistance of a disguised Sherlock Holmes. This takes place conveniently during ""the great hiatus"", when Holmes is supposed to be dead. The only problem is that if the uranium ORE was mutating the rats, then Holmes himself would have died of radiation poisoning MINING said ore, much less during the refining process. The best story of the Giant Rat is in""Resurrected Holmes"". I suggest the reader peruse it. The three stars are for originality.Quoth The Raven."
3,Charging problems,This phone is nice and thin and very comfortable. The only problem that I have had with this phone is that the charger and the hands-free use the same slot on the phone. I have had problems with the contact and I have to sometimes put a rubber band around the charger to get it to charge. My sister has the same phone and has had to have hers replaced twice because hers won't charge at all.
3,"Good, but not great","I bought this phone. Works great in the US, but does not work at all with service providers in India. It's a delicate phone and pretty long. I am unable to hold in my trouser pockets."
2,not the best phone in the world,"All my friends use the same service as I do and none of them have the clarity problems that I do with this phone. I break up every other sentence while talking to them .. it gets really annoying to have to repeat yourself everytime.The sound quality kind of sucks. I keep the volume on the highest level and still have to hold my other ear closed and press the phone to my ear to hear most of the time.other than those problems, I like the phone. The camera takes quality pictures, and texting is easy. Ringing volumes are loud enough to hear anywhere, pretty much.If I went back in time and knew what I know about this phone, I would not choose it again."
2,Plum Bad,"I upgraded to this phone about six month ago and have had so many dropped calls. The reception is horrible! Just about every call that is longer than five minutes is dropped. I don't get service in the grocery store, at work, at my boyfriends house or at my mothers house. I don't think that it is the carrier because my previous phone did not have these problems. It is very small and lightweight and the autolock feature is nice. The camera takes clear pictures and the alarm clock has admirable features. The display screen is clear but the buttons are just a little too small for my fingers. I would suggest choosing another phone because having one that does not get service is kind of pointless."
1,Avoid,- Battery lasts for short time- User interface is unintuitive and is not optimized for typically carried out tasks- The phone manages to unlock itself and start calling people! This situation is even worse if you have a bluetooth headset. This is perhaps the worst thing about this device
3,Apocrypha,"This book deals in a challenging and novel way with several non-pentatucal biblical books. Charlesworth lends academic credance to what is often described as speculation, rumour and myth. This is a great book but I deducted one star because of the lack of illustration and one star because the index is pitiful. Otherwise a great read."
4,Family Values,"""Anyone and Everyone"" is a fascinating documentary about families struggling with their children's homosexuality. It shows a range of people- Cherokees, Hindus, Catholics, Jews, Southern Baptists, and Mormons. The families are upfront and honest--even the Indian family which has basically disowned their gay son. The documentary keeps the gay issue from being black&white.; The families are confused--torn between their doctrine and their children. Who-or what-do they love more?""Anyone and Everyone"" is a fast-moving documentary,with plenty of food for thought. Unfortunately,it leaves out Muslims,as well as those who belong to more progressive churches like Unity and Religious Science. The Jewish family shows that even those who have liberal congregations (with a female rabbi) struggle with their children's sexual orientation.""Anyone and Everyone"" is an educating and informative film."
1,Great film but problem dvd,"I love this DVD but there must be something wrong with the latest batch of DVDs because the motion is very jerky and nobody else has complained about it (yet?). I tried playing it on two different computers, my DVD player, and my XBox, so I know it is indeed the DVD. Amazon replaced it after I explained the problem, but they just sent me another bad DVD. So it's actually a disk-maker's problem and Amazon doesn't seem to have a way to deal with a situation like this. I would very much like to share this movie but it's very hard to watch. If I were the publisher of this DVD, I would be very quick to fix a problem like this."
1,Rubuked by Lincoln's own son,"For anyone who 1) would seriously believe that Lincoln's killing was not only a Vatican plot, but because Catholicism is really Satan-controlled ""Baal worship"" designed to trick would-be believers away from belief in Christ and 2)not an anti-Catholic bigot, the claims of ""50 Years in the Church of Rome"" (the source) were thoroughly rebuked - even Lincoln's son (who was a laywer in Chiacgo) proclaimed it garbage."
1,Paranoid anti-Christian ranting,"Jack Chick is an anti-Christian writer. In this volume, he attacks Catholicism. But he just as often attacks ""evangelical"" Christians, who he believes as part of a Vatican-controlled plot to demolish the King James Only-Fundamentalists, the cult group that Chick represents. (The Evangelicals' crowning blasphemy: translating the NIV.)Evangelicals can now stand tall with pride - Baptists, Assemblies of God, Nazarenes and other born-again Christians are now the enemies of the Nativist bigots who want an all-white, Calvinist America. Yippee!"
1,Not worth it,We ordered this item for my son. It was suppose to be new but a refurbished scratched one missing a remote came in the mail. It was also not the model displayed on the web page.
3,Not as expected,"This was a reconditioned dvd player. Advertisement is false when it says new. It plays fine, does not play both through TV and dvd at same tome."
1,Mis-leading to customer,"I purchase this product on line though Amazon. Com, they advertise this product to be NEW, so I could not beat the price they sold it for, we'll when I got the product, it was used, it did not have the remote controller in it, and it did not work. Of course I am sending it back to Tiger Products, they told me that it was used, I think that is false advertizing, people should really check out the company before they buy product from them on line.Ben D. San Diego, Ca"
4,Good toy,"Good toy, my son really enjoyed with animasyon. They are a little small, but my son liked them. They are made of durable plastic."
3,Very cheap,"The animals are cute, but they don't stand up very well at all. Very frustrating for a 3 year old when her animals keep falling over each time she just breathes on them."
2,not worth 9.99,bought for a stocking stuffer... looks like cheep dollar store toys. very disappointed. thought they would be a little bigger or something.
5,Terric little phlate-free animal figurines,"Everybody has animal figurines, but many of them are very cheap so that the features of the animals are not terribly realistic. These are pretty good considering their size and price. The plastic has a sturdy feel and is phlate free.The Wild Toob is the best one to get if you're only going to get one. It has all the land animals in it that are popular in books and such but children might not get to see in real life. Having the animals in 3D really popped them in my kid's memory so she very quickly learned their names at 22 months. We pull out relevant animals when she is watching programs that feature them. We have collected about 9 of the Toobs in total; mostly because I enjoy them so much ;)FYI, some of the animals have their names printed on their bellies if you look really closely."
3,Just okay....,"These animals are even smaller than they look in the picture. My son does enjoy playing with them, but definitely not worth $10.00."
3,Little Small But Cute,"These are smaller than I had anticipated but they're cute. If your child likes playing with and learning about animals, it might be worth it =)"
3,"Good, but Small!!!!","The animals are very small, about size of quarter, some a tad bigger. They could pose a hazard for both small kids and those whom walk around the house without shoes. My girls like them, just wish they were a bit bigger, so just know they are quite small."
2,Full of cliche's,"Although funny every once in a while, full of stories that easily can be beaten by anecdotes in the smokers room, any bar or various internet sites"
3,Confusion,"The book is wonderful as a whole. I like the content andenjoy the book. However the wording is confusing. She writes in circles making me reread what I read before to figure out what is happening. I would not suggest this book to an other high school student. No college student either for that matter. This is the kind of book you read when you have time to sctarch you head and say ""What the...?"" then reread it again. I will read it again and maybe the third time is the charm?"
3,average scent,it's a fresh and sweet fragance but not long lasting is for person that like a ligthy scents..and disapear 1 or 2 hours later.
1,Don't bother.,"If you're a serious student of yoga, this is not the video for you. The models are only marginally familiar with yoga, do not perform the postures well, are crowded together hip by jowl for some reason best explained by the director, and the narration is desultory and unclear at best. If you're leaning more toward the ""hot male"" end of the equation, this is not for you either. The fellows never shed their thongs, and while the three models are not in bad shape, the filming is fuzzy and soft-focus, the lighting dark and indistinct. If it's yoga you want, look elsewhere; ditto for soft-core naked guys."
4,Good Cover,"This is a good cover. I just wasn't expecting it to be this bulky. I'm getting use to it though, it seems like it gives my Zune more protection from dings and from being dropped. I really like the screen protector. A word of warning though, if you have a Zune Dock like I do this cover is too bulky for it to dock and you have to take it off every time you want to use it. The regular USB cable works fine and all the buttons and headphone jacks work. Even though this case is pretty bulky, it has a nice look to it and I would recommend it to people that want some protection for their Zunes."
3,Christmas gift.,There is a very large bubble in the water. I wasn't expecting that but I ordered a similar globe from another vendor and it also had a smaller air bubble. Maybe the manufacturer just doesnt do this well. I am disappointed but think my grandaughter will be satisfied. The price was right.
2,Poor Shipping/communication,The guide was fine however it took six weeks before it arrived. The seller only replied to one of three E-Mails. I would not/will not buy again from this seller.
2,1st time mom,"Somewhat entertaining, quick read, NOT informative. It was more about people sharing briefly their experiences than it was about actual useful tips. It's comforting to read about other parents going through similar challenges but you can read about that for free at one of those online newsletters [...] AND get some real, useful advice from other parents and experts in childcare. Not worth the money to get the book.I won't be keeping this on my shelf for much longer."
5,Cigar smokers dream,This is the knife I have been waiting for. It is the perfect size for every day carrying. And the cigar punch works great. I love having three sizes to choose from. I only wish it had a bottle opener instead of a scissors.Update: had this knife for 3 years now. Still looks like new. It is very difficult to scratch and the red logo is still perfect. Just took a business trip to Canada and the mean TSA lady confiscated my knife. I immediately ordered new one as soon as I got home.
3,"WORKS WELL, Nice to have differant punch sizes. Small problem",The large center punch hole has a thin wall and has cracked after a couple weeks of use. It has a lifetime warranty. I'll have to return it. Besides that I like it.
4,Nice Interpretation,"Jonell is one of those performers who is at her best when captured live. She pours her whole heart and soul into each song. This CD is a beautiful tribute to Townes Van Zandt and has many sparkling moments. I would recommend it to anyone with an ear for good music. The arrangements are excellent and the production top notch. If you ever do get the chance to hear Jonell live don't miss it. You will have a fine time, indeed!"
1,Never again Sony,"Wow, my DSC-P10 just died yesterday. The screen went all fuzzy and so did the pictures. Based on the other messages here, it seems like this camera just wasn't meant to last longer than a few years. Too bad, for me. This wasn't a cheap camera at the time. I'm buying a Canon next."
3,Sony DSCP10 is not for advanced photographers,"The Sony DSCP10 Cybershot 5 MP is a good quality camera but is only suitable for those who are happy with the preset settings that come with the camera. My biggest gripe is that there are no manual override (i.e you cannot change the preset settings), aperture priority or shutter priority which makes the camera virtually useless if you want want more control on how your pictures are taken. If you are happy with simple snapshots, then go for it. But if you want to be a bit more creative, you will be better of with a Canon or Nikon."
2,Very Disappointed,"I owned a P5 before getting this P10 and I am not at all impressed with the quality. The features are great, but I can't seem to get a decent picture out of it. I have tried different settings and while the added pixels provided a better quality, every picture I take is blurry. I've probably taken close to 1000 pictures and I the most important shots come out blurry. I never had this problem with my P5, and this upgrade was not an upgrade at all."
2,nice pictures but broken after 4 months,"Right after the warranty expires, the camera will no longer charge the battery.Of course I can ship the camera to Sony for repair, and ALL I have to pay is labor!I recommend buying another camera or alternatively buy the extended warranty."
2,A bit disappointed,"This was my first digital camera. At first I was so impressed with the whole digital camera thing and all the camera's cool features, BUT, after about 200-300 pictures, I realized that I could practice until blue in the face and I will still get a lot of blurry pictures. I realize you will get some of that but I have 2 friends that have much less expensive cameras that take much clearer pictures. I wouldn't care so much if this camera was $150-200 but I paid over $400. Even when a picture is not blurry, they are somewhat grainy. Pictures look like they came from a disposable camera. I'm so irritated when someone sends me a picture that is far superior in quality than the ones my camera takes,and I know their camera iwas like $200 cheaper. I've adjusted the settings, read the manual a couple of times, I just think this is as good as it gets."
1,Nevery Buy Sony! They Steal Your Credit Balance!,"I want to relate a horror experience from Sony. I tried to buy a camera from Sony's website. The deal never went through, although I gave my credit card details. Amazingly, Sony, in spite of not being able to sell the product, nevertheless reserved the total amount of the deal from my credit card for nearly three weeks! Hours of phone calls could not fix the situation -- Sony only said that my credit card balance would eventually get corrected. Sony could not deliver the product, yet they took my money for three weeks. Because of this, my travel booking got cancelled due to credit card balance being over the limit.Never, never, never buy a Sony! They are crooks! Besides, their products stink, too -- cheap manufacture from China, low quality."
3,Limited Warranty is useless,"I bought this in 10/2003. Love the camera itself. It is my second Sony digital, having used the prior Mavica for thousands of pictures. The lens just stopped working; would not open. Sure, parts are covered for 12 months, but no labor after 90 days. They gave me an estimate at the auth. svc. ctr. of $235 to fix labor. For a tad more, you can buy a new one...but why should I have to!?"
5,best camera for printing big pics,"i upgraded from an olympus 2.1 megapixel camera to the p10 and have never looked back! this is by far a camera that produces quality rich pics with crystal clear detail, vibrant colors and a fairly easy to use operating format. i've printed many 8 1/2 x 11in pics and keep getting the same response from people when i tell them that its from a digital camera and not film. they are totally blown away!!! so am i! this camera not only makes film processing obsolete but it also produces images that give film a run for their money. the battery life is fairly long compared to my old camera and the camera design is very sleek and compact. i dont think i'll be trading this camera for a while. the p10 has been one of my best electronic buys ever!"
2,not good for moving object,shutter speed is not fast enough to capture a moving object. i took a lot picture for my son and just a few are good. and it becomes very slow recently and then finally broken last week.
3,It's... Okay...,"While the pictures the camera takes are of pretty great quality, the biggest problem I have with this camera is that if you move it even just a little while you take a picture, the whole picture is blurry. Not great for candid moments, when you don't have time to hold perfectly still. If you just figure a way to get past this problem, you've got a great camera on your hands."
2,Not for taking photos of baby!,"You have to wait for your camera is ready, but your baby is not going to wait for you. We have been missing the moments. Sometime even I can't wait for it. So don't buy this camera to take photos of your baby. I might have to change to something as fast as my baby is."
2,too slow/broken,"I've had this camera for a few years but used disposables more often. Not good for sudden shots. Takes too long to start up, and the flash takes too long as well. By the time both things are done, the moment is gone or everyones tired of posing.Also, it's never been dropped, wet, left in the sun, set on sand, ect. None of the meny things that could happen to a camera, but it stopped working suddenly. LCD screen is black with lines. Wish I had bought a cannon."
3,Okay fountain but just okay,"AS other reviewers have stated, the solar panel is picky. It HAS to have direct sunlight or no dice. There is no ac adapter so it is a quiet fountain most of the time. That is saying a lot considering I have it on a Western-facing patio in the blazing sun in California. It still only runs a couple hours a day unless I feel like monkeying with the solar panel several times a day."
4,Fun Fountain,"Neat fountain; but,forget solar power in Maine. Well packaged, fast delivery. Really improved by placing in terra cotta colored plastic dish for monster plant pot. Fill dish with white marble chips."
3,Tom S.,"The description on this fountain was deceiving and incorrect --- it DID NOT come with an AC adaptor (as stated in the description) and this was the specific reason I purchased it for my brother. Unfortunately, he did not notify me about the lack of an AC adaptor until recently. I advised him to call the company to supply the adpator, but apparently a different model (same fountain without the AC adaptor) was sent to him then what I had ordered."
3,Missing AC Adapter,"As other reviewers have noted, the fountain arrived without the AC adapter. My patio is shaded from noon 'til dusk, so withoutthis piece, the fountain is useless in the afternoon/evening. I'm giving it a one star since this seems to be an ongoing problem with other customers as well.When I order a product, I expect it to come with all parts that facilitate the advertised functionality. The fountain is advertised as ""Solar and AC power"".I'll update the review if/when the seller addresses this situation.Update: I requested the AC adapter and received it couple of days later. I'll give a 3 star rating.The fountain is fine. I just don't like having to request missing parts."
1,Wrong fitment supplied by Amazon,"I too had problems with fitment. I entered all necessary car info and it said these would fit, however they were too large. I ended up buying the correct ones locally and returning these. I've found that it is a good idea to check fitment of parts purchased on this site with the mfg's website to make sure you are getting the correct parts. Amazon did return the parts for a refund, I applaud them for that."
3,Cheap and works but some are ...,"I decided to replace my rotors rather than resurface them because these were cheap and could be delivered to my door. I ordered two identical rotors however one turned out to be out of spec. When I rotated it it would weave in and out and then bind on the caliper, and yes it was properly torqued down with lug nuts. Anyhow, I had to put the old rotor back on so I could drive while waiting for Amazon to send me a replacemment."
3,wrong fitment,"According to the vehicle information I entered, this rotor was supposed to fit my girl's car. It was obvious when I was installing it that there was no way in hell. Luckily I do own an Integra that these rotors do fit, so the next brake job I have for my car I will at least have new rotors ready. At least the price was good. The vehicle fitment drop down listings need to be fixed to avoid future mix-ups for other customers."
2,Interesting children's book,The book is interesting. It mixes the mythology with fiction. If someone is looking for a light entertaining then this book is for them.
2,Don't bother,"There's very little insight here. Nothing incorrect that I found, but if you are serious about studying the Bible literally any other commentary would be more thorough and interesting to read."
3,Just About All That Is Available,"Not many books are yet available on J2ME. For this reason alone, this text is decent. However, much of the text is simple embellishement of the limited J2ME MIDP documentation available from Sun. The examples are decent but sometimes confusing -- I typed in several and experienced minor problems with a few. My basic issue with the text is the lack of explaination. Code examples are good, but explaination is better and the topics are only modestly explained.Overall, a decent first book on this issue but nothing spectacular."
2,Sloppy in the Details,"An otherwise decent book rendered completly frustrating by lack of attention to deatails. For a seasoned programmer, the most difficult thing about learning a new technology is the environment issues. This book fails to point out that key J2ME zip and jar files need to go into your classpath before the examples work. The reason you buy a book like this is to not have to learn this kind of detail on your own. Unfortunately, this book ignores many such details."
3,Pistons World Champs CD,"This CD was done after the Detroit Pistons won the 2004 NBA Title. Deee-Troit Basketball was the rally cry at games and at the Rallies at Hart Plaza and the Palace. This was an OK CD. It's just the radio version of the song, and the Dance mix and another mix of the song. It has clips of the games, the end of game 5 of the finals, and the rallies inserted in the song."
1,Dangerous pan holder,"This type of pan holder is just what I've been searching for, but unfortunately it doesn't work. As someone else pointed out, it slips round and won't grip. This is really dangerous when trying to strain off boiling liquid from a pan. I nearly lost the contents on me and the floor. My pans have normal, average size handles.I will buy this item again if the company can work out how to make a tighter fit. I wrote to them and got nice reply stating this is how they're made and if I don't like them I should return them to the store for a refund. If enough people write they might do something about it."
1,Not a snug fit; slippery on handle,"I purchased this to use on my beloved Lodge cast iron skillet & grill pan, but it does not fit snugly on the handle of either pan. I did trim the silicone at the opening so it would not be overly long, but it was still a bit wide for the handle; the loose fit made me nervous the couple of times I used it.Great concept, but it didn't work for me. I'll stick to my reliable old school potholders."
5,Reminds me of moonlit nights at The Royal Hawaiian&#65533;,"If you like Steel Guitar/Hawaiian music this is a great CD. Makes one think of being on the lani at The Royal Hawaiian over looking the beach at night, during a full moon. One can almost feel the luscious ocean breezes that brush across one's skin like heavy silk and, one imagines that just faintly, one can detect the scent of plumeria mixed with the salt air."
5,Entertaining,"Authentic Hawaiian Playing. Very soothing and relaxing piece. For private listening or sharing with friends during get-together. Highly recommended, no regret!"
3,"It's an uneven effort, lacks the punch of other work.","Sorry to say that this disk has failed to grow on me, as I had hoped desperately it would. Admittedly, I haven't listened to it for a while because I always play more solid efforts when in an Ely mood. The most disappointing part is I that I don't find any tunes on this disk that typify the lyricisim and pure rockability that are the Ely hallmark. I'll give it another shot, but am hoping that the next effort will be a return to the music that makes this guy one of my top five favorites and, along with Nils Lofgren, one of the most underrated and underappreciated rockers of my generation."
3,Disappointed,"Hey, I am as big an Ely fan as anyone (I have five CDS with his autograph on the cover) but, in this case, I have to spit into the ""Wind"" (excuse the pun). I keep listening to this thing and just can't force myself to like it. To me, it is uneven at best , and I don't want to think about the worst. Joe, I know ""they"" say that when an artist releases a live recording that they are out of creative juices, but since you are the best ""live"" guy around how about a new live CD, throw some of this stuff on it, and I might appreciate it a whole lot more."
4,A must-have for any student of politcal philosophy.,"There are few books from college that remain with me 15 years later. This is one of them. Arendt's writing transcends academia. Not only does her philosophy apply to politics but it can easily be applied to all relationships (worker/employer, parent/child, siblings, black/white, etc),as all relationships involve a power struggle. Her general thesis is that where there is lack of power or where power is slipping away, there is greater potential for violence. Lack of power begets violence. Apply that to the current world scene and you begin to wonder exactly how safe we are. In re-reading it recently, I couldn't help think that this book could just as easily be prescribed for management solutions...right alongside The Art of War."
4,Big Block Battlers Tomy AFX race car set,"I bought this race set for my 5 year old son and 10 year old son. Nostaglic memories with this toy. The toy is certainly more durable and economic when compared to the plastic junk you find at the retailers nowadays. Not to mention, they pay for themselves in savings of battery cost. Pretty durable! Fun! Needs a lot of room! Cars are fast and require dexterity to keep them on the track! With a little practice my boys were doing fine! I think that they are a little over priced, but TOMY's is supposed to be the best, so I paid it! I would buy this product again!!"
3,Gets better as you go,"At first I didn't like the flashing between past and present, and I miss being able to move around an entire village like the 2nd game, but this one still has some cool parts. ONce you learn the tricks each player has (another curveball) it starts to feel more comfortable. However, I didn't like feeling like I had to check the same drawers or hiding places every single time a new player came on the scene, just in case I missed something.I still found myself not caring that much about going back. Just too complicated to get really involved in any character."
3,This fatal frame was okay & that's being nice,not at all what the other two games were! the great thing the series has going for it is that they all have a great replay value.
2,Recycled Video Games,"This game is just awesome. I didn't mind at all that Tecmo copied and pasted at least 50% of the content from the previous two Fatal Frame games. I especially liked how they kept the rooms and the puzzles the same as well. No need to waste time figuring them out as they have the same solution as the previous games - How thoughful of Tecmo designers.I have been disapppointed by a number of games I have bought in the past, but this is a new experience for me. It is the first time I have felt a game development company stole my money."
4,An interesting book but confuses Russia and Soviet Union,"I enjoy reading ""A Short History Of World War II"", it's a good overview with a lot of interesting information for those who want to learn more about the subject in a short time. Yet, I'm quite disappointed that the author continually confuses Russia and the Soviet Union. No doubt that Russia played a major role in the Soviet Union but speaking of World War II Ukraine and Belarus suffered probably the most and fought very hard. The author seems to overlook the fact and keeps on referring to everyone on the Soviet side as Russians, which is simply not true. By the way, it's not ""the"" Ukraine, it's Ukraine, just like France, Slovakia, Poland etc. Ukraine is a nation in its own and has always been. I would expect a historian to know that.But, overall it's a great book and I would definitely reccoend it."
1,"Typical Ugly-American, condescending twrds WWII real heroes.","All references to Charles de Gaulle are demeaning and distort the true impact he had on the turnabout and the final outcome of WW II. True, Churchill provided a home base, but he, let alone the American leadership, didn't devise how to go against the Axis. It is de Gaulle who motivated and led the Free French, without whom the Panzers would have just kept on rolling all the way to Africa. And where were the Americans before 1944, when 20 millions people were getting killed, soldiers and civilians? UNDECIDED IN CONGRESS!. Plus a change, plus c'est la mme chose! This book is but one of the fine examples of prejudice towards the French leadership and the great exaggerations about the U.S. decisive influence in WWII and other periods that are unabashedly fed to the American public in every portrayal of European historical events. And just where do you teach, Prof. Stokesbury?"
5,Jersey Rock like you've never seen it before!,"This album is so hot. If you havent seen this band live you are missing out so get this album now and keep your eyes peeled for tour dates in your area. For those of you that have, you have felt the intensity of what Rye can do and you must have this album if you dont already. I cannot fully express in words the power of Rye Coalition. This Jersey bands rocks harder than any other bands around right now. This record is a testament to that fact. Get this now! Your heart rate craves it!"
4,Jesus Lizard + Led Zeppelin = AWESOME.,"The Rye Coalition have been destined for a major label for a long time -- they are way more deserving of radio play than other ""mainstream indie"" bands like the Hives and the Strokes, and yet until the Summer of 2003 when they signed to DreamWorks, they were largely unappreciated. Only time will tell where their new major-label home will take them.But all that history has nothing to do with the quality of ""On Top"". In short, this album rocks. The homage to classic rock song titles are a little much (""stairway to the free bird on the way to the smokey water""?!), but don't let that get in the way of your enjoyment of the actual songs, which really will shake you all night long. The only disappointment in this album is that the energy that these songs have live -- especially the album-closer ""Honky, Please!"" -- gets a little lost in the studio recordings. The lyrics are meaningless, but you won't care -- you'll be too busy shaking your booty."
5,It has remained,"What can I say about this album that other folks haven't said already? This has to be one of the best albums I've had the pleasure of listening to in a long while. I purchased this bad boy when it first hit the shelfs and not a day has gone by that I haven't listened to it at least once. It is truly a stellar album which merits multiple listens. There isn't one bad cut on the album itself and rocks you harder than most other bands out today. I'd have to say that the final three cuts on the 2nd side of the LP are a perfect trio. There hasn't been an album that closes with such passion, force and gusto like this in a long time. ""Honey, Please"" is a perfect example of what the group is able to pull off. I can listen to that song over and over again (and I have!) For those of your who are fans of bombastic yet intelligent and tasteful rock n' roll, this album and band alike is quintessential."
2,whatever happened to the rye??,"I remember seeing these guys in 96' or 97' and being blown away they were truly the next big thing (o.k. how about the next thing). Anyway back in the days of ""White Jesus"", ""Baby"", ect. they truly had something original. I remember seeing the beginning of the downfall of this band as they became obsessed with the Zep (no shame in that, but don't rework your band to be like the Zep, for god sakes there&#65533;s already a Zep). Any way this album is an unsuccessful fusion of 60's and 70's Stones, Zep and CCR riffs mixed w/ some gang of four and wire and I dunno, it just don't work. I personally think they should change their name so to not confuse this with the past genius of the rye coalition."
2,He saw duh what?,"Like everyone has already said, this is Jesus Lizard meets AC/DC. You like it or you don't and I don't. If I can hear the styles the band is lifting than obviously so can you. In other words, go buy some Jesus Lizard or some AC/DC and be done with it. Yes, Ralph or whatever the singer's name is in this band did get cuffed in the mouth by David Yow and deservedly so. Steve Albini needs to back off when he says the Jesus Lizard ""sold out"" when they went to a major and quit trying to fake people out. Producing Steve, yes producing not ""recording"" albums by Chevelle, Page and Plant, that Aussie teenage grunge band whatever their name is and especially these guys is very underground of you to do Mr. Steve. 2 stars for ""trying"" to rock since they are ""better"" than The Strokes, Jet, or White Stripes but really how hard can that be?"
4,Juturna Still Owns This...But Good Nonetheless,"This CD contains the greatest Circa song I've ever heard, ""Living Together"". Absolutely gorgeous tune.This album really has a few standout tracks but some of them seem kind of repetitive (Tracks 2 and 3 especially).Juturna was definitely a more solid album all the way through. I would not put this CD off nonetheless, it has some really solid tunes and Kicking Your Crosses Down has one of the prettiest hooks ever."
3,"Not Juturna, but nothing too special either.","This was a good album instrumentally, but too many of the songs actually sounded like one or another. There were no outstanding songs to say, ""Kicking Your Crosses Down"" was one that sounded different from the cd. Ultimately, not excited about this album, one that won't be on repeat."
5,Its So Awesome!,Circa Survive is so awesome..there just so talented..they do so much experimentation with there music there so talented and Anthony green's voice is the icing on the cake..his voice is so awesome and soothing..if your looking for something Great Fresh and new..look no further..Circa Survive is what you need..its gonna blow your mind.
3,"Good idea, but, bad design","If you're on the go, whether on a bus, train, plane, or you're always in a different coffee shop with sturdy metal rods, and you worry about your iProduct security, then this will work just fine to protect it. The metal string is very thin, however, and could probably be cut with a good set of wire cutters, but, honestly, what common theif carries those around in his back pocket anyways? Maybe he/she has a pair of scissors, but, I tried that, and, that wasn't easy. Hopefully, by the time you notice them trying to cut through the wire, you'll have them punched in the face. Anyways...Recommended for people who need on-the-go security for the iProducts.NOT recommended for people who are at home most of the time and would probably need their dock port for something more useful, like battery charging."
4,Perfect Blend,"There's an irreplaceable feeling attached to reading Kafka directly. Furthermore, Kafka himself probably would have hated the idea of images being made of his stories. That being said, I can't think of any better artist than Crumb to illustrate that over-used term ""Kafkaesque.""This book is a great introduction - as titled - and a perfect blend in at least two ways: 1) The juxtaposition of Kafka's life and work presents the depth of his stories as well as some of the possible inspirations from his real life - like the role his overbearing father played in his creation of authoritative characters. And 2) as already mentioned, the at-times-terrifying-but-always-amusing art of Robert Crumb with the similarly dark-comedic styling of Kafka himself. (Kafka is said to have been inclined to laugh when reading his own work)This is the only book of this introductory series I've read so far, but I would take this as an indication of a set of worthwhile books."
4,Great,"The ""Introducing..."" series is quite uneven: there are some great books in it, but also some very dull ones. In general, books about authors are good, since they can combine the life of the writers with part of their stories. I love the one about Proust and the one about Camus; those about Joyce and Tolkien weren't so good on the other hand. The one about Kafka is one of the best, and this is due in no small part to the drawings of author Robert Crumb, who was able to bring to life (sorry about the cliche) Kafka's perverted imagination (yes, perverted is the right word) as probably few other artists would. Strongly recommended."
4,Interesting collaboration.,"This is a good introduction to Kafka, and should be useful for students who haven't read him before. The drawings, of course, are great, and the coverage of his work is more complete than you would get by just reading one or two stories. Of course it's no substitute for the real work, and so shouldn't be treated as a version of Spark Notes."
5,Excellent product!,It really works! I have more mental clarity and can focus longer. This is my second bottle and will buy it again.
2,Can Elevate BP and Cause Insomnia,"First of all, I love Doctor's Best brand. I am working on a weightloss program and chose this product for that reason but for improved cardiac function as well.I found that taking it after 12 Noon caused an inability to sleep at night even with melatonin/tryptophan/5-htp. I didn't figure out the cause for 2 days, so I was a zombie for 3 days.It also seems to raise my BP which is a known side effect for this supplement.Another website recommended using only half a capsule which I am doing today. Today on half a capsule, I am feeling sleepy, kind of out of it with a shortness of breath thing as well. This website suggested half a cap 3 times a week which was my plan, but we'll see.I wanted to alert anyone with BP issues or insomnia about my experience. This supplement may be great for some people, but some like me may find that it speeds up metabolism a bit too much for them."
2,Did not work for me,For what I needed I was hoping it would of done the trick.My health issue not so much.I do not blame the vitamin just did not work for me.
3,FAST DELIVERY,"Bought it due to other positives involving Aspergers elsewhere on the net.For me does NOT seem effective, HOWEVER Amazon had the best price for it.I gave it a shot for this ONE specific reason but after a month no difference at all.Would give it 1 star as for effectiveness, 5 stars for price and delivery--averaging 3 stars.FOR other issues may work."
1,doesnt work,"i have been taking this product and it doesnt work at all, dont waste your money.every day i took this product with no results."
4,A look at all the Children,"Peavy fills in some historical blanks while she presents the reader with the American migration westward. The missing stories she brings to us are those of the children. And not just children on the move. Frontier Children shows us images and glimpses into the lives of those children who were already there when settlers came.The book is rich with photographs of children in their time. The pictures and stories show us the diversity that was distinct in our young country at a pivotal moment of our transition into what we have become as a nation. The extensive collection of photographs in Frontier Children includes images of Mexican, Chinese, African American children as well as Native American children. That alone makes this book an unusual look at our history."
3,Not Exactly What I Expected,"Raven is a great artist and has a wonderful voice. I expected her album to have an R&B/Hip-Hop/Pop flow after hearing the first single ""Backflip"". I was so excited after purchasing the cd and rushed home and unwrapped it, popped it in, and started jamming to the first track ""Mystify"" which reminds me of a Scott Storch track with it's Arabian/Indian flow. Sort of like the pop version of Beyoncé's ""Baby Boy"". The album held steady until it hit ""Set Me Free"" which is an ok song, but not my type of song. It went downhill, then reached ""Alice"" which is a good song with a great messsage. After that, went downhill until it reached ""Bump"" which is a great Hip-Hop type track. After that, the album faded away. Raven could have did better, but I guess she had to keep her Disney Channel pop flaver. Great album with it's flaws. Raven has the voice, she needs the beats."
1,OMG this is so stupid,"Raven really thinks she is so cool and good.But truth is she can't sing.grazing in the grass is the worst excuse for a song ever.Unless you are like 4 or 7 you proubaly agree with me.I just want to save you from wasting your money thats the only reason i am even bothering with this.I don't want to see you wasting your money.trust me, i know.Use your money on Hilary Duff or Slipknot."
2,?????,"To the dude who said that Hilary Duff is prettier than anyone else in the world, have you ever looked at Gwen Stefani, Kate Piersion, or Cindy Wilson? Those ladies are far more prettier."
1,Cotton Candy Music,"I applaud Raven's Hustle with doing TV,Film&Now Music but Musically thus far she ain't that much of a threat. She has a aight Voice at best&that ain't gonna cut it. the Material is ok in spots but not a single song is a knockout.not quite Her time as a Musician, but in time who knows maybe a ""control"" awaits her who knows?"
1,Do not buy this!,"First of all raven's t.v show was stupid, not to mention childish, i thought that her C.D had to be better (I WAS SO WRONG). Raven cannot sing which doesn't help considering the production is WEAK. 'Grazing in the grass' is the worst song i have heard this year, it sounds like a nursery rhyme!!!!!!! The person who wrote that song should be in jail. This is pop music for little kids. Go to towerrecords.com and hear the album for yourself and i bet you will feel the same way i do."
1,Never Ever Criticize Hilary,"Some people here have said bad things about Hilary Duff. This is wrong.Hilary Duff is a very pretty girl, the prettiest ever, and that's all that matters in this world. You cannot criticize her unless you are prettier, which simply is not possible."
1,Ok No,Well let me just say Raven was BEAUTIFUL until she let herself go. I am 11 and have NEVER been a fan of RAVEN but I will just say when she has backup like in The Cheetah Girls movies she can be a VERY PROMISING singer and Actress. Good Luck RAVEN.
4,Awesome!,"Her singing is pretty unique and this is a pretty good album. In my oppion I think the stand out tracks are "" Mystify"", "" What is love?"", "" Grazing in the grass"", and "" Typical"" also which do not appear here but I like, the songs she sang "" Supernatural"" and "" Superstition"" and true to your heart which I've only heared in a music video. Worth owning overall!"
2,Sucky singer,Yeah Raven may be a great actress but she better stick to acting. The only good song is 'Backflip'Raven=good actress
4,Good!!,When i heard that raven was making an album i was really excited because i think she is a good actress.then when i heard it i was really amazed because she has such a good voice.its a really good album.if your into the hip-hop kind of stuff then you should get this album
3,This Is Definetely Her Time,"I didn't realize that Raven Simone was coming out with an album till I was switching channels and saw BET ""Access Granted"" on making her video. I purchased her album and it is a decent album, but I assumed it would have been an R&B/Hip-Hop album, which is somewhat far from it. ""Mystify"" is a great song as well as ""Bump"". I caught a few other songs that are worth a listen. It seems though as if she is straining her voice to hit power notes as from artists as Beyonce and Alicia Keys, but she fits the hits and voice as Christina Milian. If those who haven't decided on whether or not to purchase her album, wait till the third single on radio to decide if you still want to or not."
4,This Is Her Time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I happened to be walking in the store and saw this cd.I didn't even know her album had came out yet.So i bought it.This disc is good.Better than i expected.Some of the songs dont fit her voice and are a bit weak.Her voice needs some more distinction and soul and she would be one of the best.STANDOUT TRACKS:Mystify (could hav ehad better vocals and blew this one away..but a good song)Backflip (first single good job ..nice feel to it)What Is Love?(BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM..vocally she shines)Set Me Free, Grazing In The Grass, and Whats Real? all good songs and she has alot of talent...This Is My Time (the last song on the album and she really proves to us she has what it takes to make it....GOOD JOB)OVERALL GRADE 87/100 = B"
5,Love it!,"Raven is an over-all great person. If she isn't, atleast she pretends to be one, unlike *some* pop stars *coughBRITNEYcough*. Man, I really need to get this cold checked out! :p Anyway, I got this album, and for the first month or so, I didn't touch it. Alas, it was vacation time, and all my other CDs were somewhere over the rainbow. And, ABRACADABRA! I remembered that I owned this. I forced myself to give every last song a test drive before bashing the thing to kingdom come. Turns out, I love it! It's quite insperational and the songs are great. Get it!P.S. Listen to ""Alice"" (#9) while on the swingset late at night, things happen. Trust me..."
