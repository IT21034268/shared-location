3,Not crazy about the cocoa flavor,I loved Tums smoothies while I was pregnant but the cocoa flavor wasn't great. The best one I liked was the mint flavor but it was hard to find for some reason.
5,Yummy tums,"I cannot find this flavor at any store, I think it's the best. Plus if you haven't had a smoothie tum stop what you're doing and go buy some!!!"
1,Tastes good but not worth this price,"I prefer these to the other flavours, but it is not worth $20 for one package. You can find these elsewhere for less than $5."
2,Disgusting,"I love chocolate, so I thought the flavor of these sounded great. Other reviewers say they tasted great. So I purchased them. Um....GROSS! They are totally disgusting tasting. I want to gag when I eat them. I gave them two stars because they do the job they are intended to do. But I'm sticking with the fruity flavored TUMS. I just couldn't ""stomach"" these."
5,Cocoa and Creme are the best!,"Cocoa and Creme tums are the best flavor! I am having difficulty finding them in stores, so I ordered through Amazon. If you haven't tried them, order some."
1,A shallow book for a shallow walk,"How can I compare pablum and meat? When I was first given this book back in the '60s, I was a marginal Christian who wasn't interested in knowing how the Savior wanted me to live, so this book was perfect for where I was at the time. Now I've put away childish things and gotten serious about my relationship with the Father, so I seek Him in His word."
3,book review,the complete job interview handbook i intend to present my comments in point forms and i present these ideas as a university lecturer in sri lanka. this book is very usefull both job seekers and hrm/personal managers in companies as follow as a handbook. the authers presentation of his innovative factors which related to interviwing is very attractive and it's very easy to geting understand.
1,limp flaccid rubber knobs,"I bought a black Grook hook. It's a nice clean design in theory, but it is USELESS unless you have very light tools. If you hang anything heavy on the rubber knobs (such as a mop, or rake), they no longer stand erect and proud, and pull the rings down too. The rubber needs some kind of rod inside it to stiffen it."
4,Same book Different Launguage,I liked the Book. It was practicly the same In german as it was in english. the only problem Is That germans dont have all the words we do so it lost some Of its Fabulous Detail That we know J.K writes with. Its a good book but read it in english first.
5,Great stuff.,"I picked this up at random a few weeks ago; seeing as I really like Homogenic and was really curious about how Bjork sounded live. Wow. I had no idea how awesome this CD would be. Pretty much every Bjork song I went crazy over on the albums is here in its full glory; ""5 Years"" has never sounded so powerful, nor has ""You've Been Flirting Again/Isobel."" Plus, there's some cool stuff that isn't on any of her studio albums, such as ""I Go Humble,"" ""So Broken,"" and the violin intro. Trust me, if you can only get one Bjork album, make it this one. Even if you're already a pretty big fan, you'll find something to like about this. I'm really impressed with the whole ""live"" series, just judging from this CD. Who knows; maybe I'll check out Post and Vespertine live too. Bjork rules for releasing not one, but four live albums."
1,Unreliable and poor support from Roxio,"I bought this close to six months ago, and I still can't reliably burn data or music CD-R or CD-RW. Roxio's tech support sometimes neglects to respond to queries, and their repertoire seems to consist of 1) blame the drive (i.e., have the consumer get a new one if it is still in warranty) and 2) blame the OS (i.e., the drivers are part of Mac OS X, not Toast, so the problem must lie there). Neither of these are acceptable without some diagnostic information."
1,Spin Doctor let-down,"I bought Toast Titanium so I could record LP records and cassette tapes to CD. Spin Doctor has turned out to be an extremely poor application.It will not allow me to turn down the recording volume enough to prevent distortion. The application crashes constantly while I'm setting up beginnings and endpoints of the digitized music. Roxio support told me to delete a file which did not help. With Mac OSX 10.2.3 you can not listen to the music as you digitize it. Roxio support says this is due to Mac going to OSX and that they have no plans to fix it. There is no ""help"" icon. If information is not addressed in the hard copy instructions you are out of luck. This appears to be a quick and dirty application for OS9 that doesn't function well with OSX 10.2.* or later. Spin Doctor was the entire reason that I bought Toast and frankly iTunes (V3) is easier to use than toast when it comes to organizing and using music."
5,A lot for the money,"I am very impressed with all this software has to offer. It is also very easy to use.I am transferring all my old records, cassetes, and open reel tapes using the Spin Doctor program.It provides me with filters to clean up noise as well as enhancing filters that make great sound improvementsto my old analogue stuff.It also is very easy to burn CD's and make cool labels for them. I got a good price from Amazon and a rebate which makes it an even better deal but if you pay full price it is still a bargain.Some of the software included I haven't used yet so I won't comment."
3,wrong product descrption!,"not sure about this page as the product description is for the 5 dvd set ""PINKY VIOLENCE"" and not for the film offered, so i'm guessing that is the reason for the crazy price...just in case anyone's confused out there & amazon should fix it..."
1,Treal Tv #2 Horrible!!!,"Being a Big Fan of Mac Dre, I belive, wait... I know that this is false advertisement! Why have Mac Dre on the cover when he is barely in the dvd??? All you see are a bunch of no name younsters bein stupid doin the same hyphy dance as in treal tv#1. For a dvd that has been highly anticipated by Mac dre fans, And pushed back over a year, this is what we get. They are draggin dre's name through the dirt and taking away loyal fans hard earned money. And why are they still re-releasing the same dre songs over and over again. Sounds like a Jt the bigga figga stunt that was pulled between the 1997-2003 era."
3,Get the 1st Treal,"This vid is worth lookin' at and its not like Dre aint on there bc/ they do the Hana mutha f#c*in Lou Lou thing, but right there are a lot of segways and clips that just aint Thizzle Washington. It lacks the excitement and real energy of the first Treal as hosted by: Mac Dre. In addition, I was a little shocked at the portion of the video depicting some pretty harsh street fights with kids and girls going at it in a way that was a pretty sick and not so funny, unlike when adults throw the dawgs. Look at 'Treal Volume 2' if you follow the Bay and Thizz pretty tight but it aint Mac Dre's feature."
4,Zagat Survey Does The Job,"The Zagat survey is a fairly comprehensive restaurant guide to Los Angeles. It is also pretty accurate in terms of price and food quality. I've been to a few of the restaurants in the survey and the review was pretty much right on. Plus, there are plenty of restaurants in here to satisfy any craving.On the downside, the book doesn't list restaurants by area, only alphabetically. You have to scan the whole book to find the ones in your area. Also, there are a lot of unrated restaurants. I would rather see ratings for those, even if the sample size was low, with a qualifier that the sample size was low. Finally, there are some real gems out there that are missing from the survey. The survey includes a few chain restaurants, which it would be better served replacing with some of the mom and pop shops that you can eat good at."
5,Required Reading for Customer Service Providers/Professional,"What a great book! A practical and quick read that should be mandatory for everyone that works in the customer service arena. The sections are divided in such a way that you can immediately put in place the ideas presented. A perfect book for anyone working with Customers, CEO's, a gift for your boss or the Customer Service Consultant. It's a ""must read and pass-on"" book."
5,A TIMELESS CLASSIC!,"Landlubber or sailor, this one will have you up on your feet and singing along! ""Away You Santy"" has to be the benchmark recording of sea shanties and sea songs! This, the trio's first CD, contains honest, straight-forward, non-pretentious, accoustic renditions of sea songs, shanties, and tunes. It is an enthusiastic and lively collection performed with vocals, squeezebox, banjo, guitar, and pennywhistle, creating an authentic maritime sound that one can easily imagine hearing on board a creaky old wooden ship. I've had a copy since it was first released on cassette back in 1982 before it was remastered and released by Delta/LaserLight) and have never grown tired of it - I highly recommend this out-of-print and rare musical gem!"
1,Don't buy this!!!,"This is absolute crap!I bought this and some buttons wouldn't work at all, and the ones that did the feel was cheap and terrible.I took it back and paid [...] bucks more for the genuine MS item - high quality and works 100%"
1,Better off paying the exra $5 for a good one,"As other reviewers have said, there are no instructions in the package or on the website of the manufacturer. My console does not respond to the remote at all."
5,Garage and Workshop Gear Guide,"Very comprehensive as to what is needed in a garage workshop. It covers the essentials of preparing the garage (floor coating, lighting, heating, cooling, wiring, workbenches, storage, etc). It then covers various areas of tools - what they do and what is necessary and some advanced tools.Both the beginning user who wants a simple workshop and the more advanced mechanic setting up a more comprehensive workshop are well served by this book.From the recommendations in this book and my specific requirements, I made a spreadsheet with all the items I needed. I then used this to do a Google search, go up on Amazon, Sears, and other sites to search for specific tools and prices. The result is acquiring higher quality tools at the best price available."
3,recommend for a novice,"Book's reputation was a ""must have"". Book was laid out nicely. Designed for a novice. It didn't offer much to an experienced mechanic."
1,thedude,"When musicians take on a different style, one can only hope it's for the better. This album is the reason why Chris Poland gave up on metal..it's really bad. Try this solo cd ""Chasing The Sun"" and the OHM material....much better !!"
1,disasterous,"Being an Anthropology major and have read many anthropological books. This is by far the worst book I have ever had to read. Rappaport rambles on and on in a meaningless train of thought, then three paragraphs later changes his mind on what he was thinking. After reading this book from front to back cover, I will never pick up a Rappaport book again. I would have learned more by watching Sesame Street than this book"
5,Much more than I expected,"I purchased this iron to satisfy and replace my desire for the laura star garment system iron that I had seen a couple of months ago; that particular system was extremely awesome however the price tag was extremely high nearing the $1,000 mark. So to help me overcome my desire for such a system I thought I would purchase the Rowenta since I had heard it was a great iron. I purchased the Rowenta DX6900. I was not expecting to be pleased in comparison to the above mentioned system. I was amazed. It did a great job on my clothes. I would recommend this iron. It pressed my clothes effortlessly and I am pleased with my purchase. And I saved a lot of money compared to the other one. I may however purchase the Rowenta Ironing Board as it appears to aid in the desired finished product. D. Smith"
2,Don't bother....,Ordered this over Amazon and it stopped working properly after a month. The iron shuts off promptly after heating up to adequate temperature. Neither Amazon or the manufacturer would stand behind their product after 30 days. Be careful and use it alot before 30 days is up!
2,short Life,This product developed a faulty power cord after only a year. The auto off function is directly linked to the position of the power cord and the thing would only stay on if the cord was untwisted and swiveled in a certain position. After about a year and a half the iron stopped turning on altogether.If it had lasted longer the iron would have been great. It is heavy with a stainless steel face that stayed relatively crud free.
1,Rowenta Duo - LEAKS all of the time,"this iron has leaked from day one. It leaks when I am pressing, It leaks when I set it on the heel. I have contacted the manufacturer, but all I got was some ""canned"" response. The suggestion was of no help. For a ""highly rated"" product with a price tag to match, this iron has finally hit the trash can after 2 1/2 years. My replacement???? A Black and Decker for $39. It has not leaked once. So price is not always a good indicator of quality......Thanks,"
2,Doesn't live up to Rowenta reputation.,"I know that this model has probably been discontinued, but the remarks I have may be relevant for Rowenta irons in general. I purchased my Rowenta DX6900 about 18 months ago at Tuesday Morning for $50. I have taken very good care to make sure it doesn't fall and get damaged. It has not met my expectations for dependability. I have used tap water or spring water consistently. (Does Tuesday Morning sell items that have been sent back to manufactures with defects, i.e. seconds?)It is leaking from the bottom while in the standing position. Vast quantities -- about half of the volume -- have poured onto my ironing board. The steam is inconsistent, too. Looking on the internet, I learned from a man who makes small appliance repairs that it is a seal that is not affixed properly.I truly thought that buying a brand with a good reputation would result in complete satisfaction with the product, but this is not so in this case."
2,Durability,After 1 year power started to work on and off depending on position of the wire. Impossible to open iron and check the problem. After 1 day of work I managed to do it. Power cable was broken inside. In German iron for this price -totally unacceptable.
2,Didn't live up to the reputation,I bought the Rowenta brand because of the great reviews and the reputation that it was the best brand of irons. I will never own another Rowenta iron because I have had 2 of them and neither lasted more than 1-1/2 years. First they started leaking and then it just died. Switched to Black & Decker and the performance is better than I had with the Rowenta. Hopefully its longevity will be better as well.
2,Lucked out,"Owning a Rowenta that faied within the first year I went the nearest Target and asked for the black Rowenta 6900 man's iron, only to find that it and model D2030 were not in stock as they described.Not ready to leave I saw a Black and Decker digital advantage model. I could have bought either of the other displayed Rowenta's but I choose the B/D model w/o a box. It was a 75% off close out.Returning home I logged on to Con. Rep. site to find that this model wasa best buy. Plenty of steam at a good price. It also shuts off the steam with setting less than 4 .......1-acryllic 7.- linen.All this for $14.95 drive out!Berne AbriolaWest Columbia, Tx"
1,Not this time Wayne,"I admire everything about Wayne Gretzky and everything he has done. But i also think Andrew did a poor job reflecting how much wayne gretzky has really accomplished. He is not just a great player , he is a great person. The book lacked certain detail and as the other reviewer said. It probably is only meant for a 3rd grade level =)"
4,"One of many, but definitely a great one","There are a lot of books about Wayne Gretzky. This is a good one with a lot of nice pictures. All the highlights are included, but if you're a Gretzky fan you won't be surprised by any real new items."
3,Live recordings of his Greatest Hits,"This collection is priced right, but you might be better off spending a little extra money buying his one of his other ""Greatest Hits"" CD's such as the 2 CD Razor & Tie compilation or ""The Very Best of Glen Campbell"" on Capitol Records unless you are already a fan. This is a live recording and not a compilation. Many of his best songs are on here but many of them are in medley form, but this does exhibit Glen doing what he loves best, and this is a good album at that."
5,HBK From The Vault DVD,"For the first time ever, Shawn Michaels talks about the matches that helped define his illustrious career and set the standard for others to follow. Seven of the matches that made him the ""Showstopper"" are presented in their entirety in this one-of-a- kind compilation:- AWA Tag Team Championship- Intercontinental Championship Ladder Match vs. Razor Ramon at WrestleMania X- Iron Man Match vs. Bret Hart at WrestleMania XII- No-Holds-Barred Match vs. Big Daddy Cool Diesel- WWE Championship Match vs. Mankind- Hell in a Cell vs. Undertaker- Shawn`s comeback Non-Sanctioned Match vs. Triple H at SummerSlam 2002DVD Extras:Three hours of bonus footage, including promos, interviews, a photo gallery and alternate commentary by Shawn Michaels and Kevin Nash on their now-classic No-Holds-Barred Match.As you can see this is a great chance to see some of HBK's greatest matches, matches that truly show why Shawn Michaels is one of the best wrestlers of all time."
3,3 stars ?,"I'am disapointed in this dvd,i was expecting more of the rockers and d-x and most of the matches are already on other wwe dvd's.very disapointing!"
5,HBK-THE SHOW STOPPER- THE MAIN EVENT!!,"FINALLY, THE GREATEST WRESTLER OF ALL TIME HAS A DVD AVAILABLE.AFTER ALL THE OTHER TRASH THE WWE HAS RELEASED, FINALLY AN ITEM THAT IS WORTH THE MONEY!SHAWN MICHAELS' BEST MATCHES ARE INCLUDED HERE, WITH A BUNCH OF EXTRA FEATURES ALSO.SHAWN MICHAELS IS STILL- THE SHOWSTOPPER- STILL THE MAIN EVENT-STILL THE HEARTBREAK KID- STILL THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS - ANDNOT TO MENTION,THE GREATEST WRESTLER OF ALL TIME!!REMEMBER, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE AND DON'T HUNT WHAT YOU CAN'T KILL!!TIMES CHANGE AND WRESTLING MAY CHANGE, BUT THE HEART AND SOUL OF THE WRESTLING BUSINESS WILL ALWAYS EXIST AS LONG AS IT REMEMBERS THE NAME SHAWN MICHAELS!!!THIS IS A DVD THAT WILL BRING A SMILE TO THE FACE OF ANY HBK FAN, SO CHECK IT OUT!!!"
1,The First Real Shawn Michaels Best Of Package,"First off, HBK is the one and only true icon in the history of wrestling, period. He is the only wrestler to back his back in a ring(1998 Royal Rumble) and return 4 years later. And this DVD is the best ""best of Shawn Michaels"" ever. This DVD has all his best know matches. i strongly recommend this to any HBK fan. You are not a true HBK unless you have this. And in closing i will say this DVD is the best release by the WWE yet."
3,hbk and the Barber Shop...?,"I recently bought the hbk dvd, and from what I just read before making this, I agree some of the matches in hbk's career should have been included. I do have a problem with the dvd set I have, and I'm not sure if anyboy else has, but there is a link titled - ""The Barber shop"" or something like that on disc 1, and I can't seem to view that segment. Other than that, there are several matches, I'm sure they should have been included.Until later..."
2,stop repeating the same matches on the wwe dvds!!!!!!!!!,"my problem is the fact that shawn v. mankind and shawn v. taker is already on other dvds. they should put his raw match with owen hart, tag match with shawn/austin v. owen/bulldog, or his match with jarret for the ic title instead."
3,Disapointing,"Even if the matches on the DVD are great and complete, I was really disapointed to find no more than 7 matches on a 2-discs DVD set. When you think WWE could manage to put more than 30 matches on Hulk Hogan's DVD (most incomplete, granted) they could have put at the very least 15 matches on this one. After all, HBK had so many great bouts. For exemple, where is the match against Jarrett when he won the IC belt ? That was a real classic. He also had a great match with Flair back in 1992 who belongs, and how many great tag-team matches with the Brainbusters and the Hart Foundation ??? What about his RAW match against Jannetty who was PWI match of the year at the time? At least the opening AWA match was really a nice touch.All in all, a good DVD who could have been great."
3,Spits On The Legacy Of Unarguably One Of The Top 3 Wrestlers Of All Time !!!!,"Doesnt Nearly Contain Enough Matches From The Early Days of Shawn Michaels 1988 Thru 1995. When He Was In The ""Rockers"" And Had His Illustrious Reign as Intercontinental Champion. Not Bad To Have The Material Surrounding WM 12 Match, But This DVD Relied Way Too Much On That Instead Of Having It There As A Bonus. Overall Shawn Michaels Boyhood Dream Is The Best Bet For Your Money, Which Concentrates Entirely On His Reign As World Champion... Although It Doesnt Come Near Presenting Shawn Michaels Career In The WWE It Accomplishes Its Goal Of Covering His Career When He Had The World Heavyweight Gold. However This DVD DOES NOT Do A Good Job Of Accomplishing Its Goal Of Covering Shawn Michaels Career!!"
3,"the ""Reasonable"" life?","I read this book during the Vietnam war while I was stationed aboard the USS America. Amazingly it was in the ship's tiny library. Reading it fed into my wish fulfillment state of mind at the time. Finding a copy in a garage sale recently, I reread it and my first thought was the naivete of the author...but I may just have become a bit cynical over the years. It is an interesting read however."
2,Knowledge of disease is primitive,"The instruction on how and why to juice vegetables and the properties of the various juices seems thorough, but the author's discussion on the cause of disease is archaic to the point of being humorous. For instance, Malaria is said to be caused by ""...excessive retention of morbid matter in the body while in an atmosphere of foul or unwholsome air..."" That belief came from the late 1800's before it was discovered that Malaria was caused by a protozoan transmitted by mosquitoes. Menopause is ""the penalty women pay for half a lifetime of eating destructive foods..."", and Syphilis thrives in ""waste matter that results from eating starch and meat products, and pasteurized milk."" This book first appeared in 1936, it may have been reprinted, but it has not been revised. Take it with a grain of salt."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,What a disappointment! This book doesn't provide any real recipes for juices. The information it has about certain vegetable juices or benefits can be found for free on the internet or in most juicing books that have far greater value than this. This is outdated and mostly useless.
3,Old book but very valuable,"I purchased this book for the first time back in the 70s. Started juicing then and after the book wore out, I replaced it again and again. It is one of the earliest and more valuable books on healing naturally through using live foods such as raw veggies and fruits in juice form which is assimilated by the body instantly. After nearly 40 years of juicing I still access this book to refresh my memory on specific juice applications."
5,A CLASSIC!!,Anyone who is interested in juicing for a better life needs this book. N.W. Walker is a pioneer in juicing and KNOWS what he is talking about. It has many recipes for specific problems. I wouldn't be without it and I've juiced for years.
4,Excellent,"Before most in this band became Spooky Tooth, they were the V.I.Ps, a straightline British R&B; band.And straight R&B; is what you get with this collection. The playing is great, and Mike Harrison had a growl like few other belters in England. Unlike the Yardbirds, the V.I.Ps did not change as R&B; was coopted by psychadelia in hard rock, so the music here does not evolve.For that, you have to listen to Spooky Tooth, but for what this is, it is great."
5,Helpful Product for Celiacs,"After reading the reviews posted, I felt it necessary to post a review as well. This product is helpful when cross contamination or accidental glutening occurs. It is by no means a substitute for a gluten free lifestyle for those diagnosed with celiac disease. It helps alleviate symptoms caused by gluten for those who suffer. For my husband, it helps alleviate symptoms when he has ingested gluten accidentally, however there is NO guarantee that it is preventing damage to your small intesting and the host of side effects you can have from uncontrolled celiac disease. Use this product, but carefully!"
1,Don't Do It!,"I bought this product for my GF. She has violent reactions to gluten. She took the product as per intructions and we had pizza. At first it appeared successful,no vomiting, no pain or any other symptoms. The next day however things changed dramatically. She ended up with Pneumonia like symptoms for three days and her joints hurt for a week. I feel horrible for putting her through this but maybe I can help someone else. Don't risk it."
1,I wouldn't order from this company...,"I never received this product. I ordered it from VitaminLife via Amazon, Amazon charged me for it but I never received any information from the company. Amazon gave me an expected delivery date, but the VitaminLife never contacted me. When the delivery dates passed I contacted Amazon, they told me to contact VitaminLife, which I did. I never heard from them. Amazon ended up giving me a refund without me having to pursue it further. I assumed that VitaminLife contacted Amazon and told them to refund it, I wouldn't know since they never contacted me. Amazon was great about it though. I have since purchased something called Gluten Digest from a local Supplement store. It works great and allows me to enjoy gluten products."
5,Mandatory,Mandatory viewing unless you want 20 years of frustration chasing instruction that tells you to do things that are exact opposite of each other. Spin the hips/don't spin.Hardy has saved us from that torment.The books are good as well but a picture is worth a thousand words make the DVD's mandatory. Hardy is Golf Digests #8th best teacher in America and he gets $750.00 an hour for a reason.
5,Midsomer Murders: Set 15,We have enjoyed these new (to USA) cases just as much as the very first cases. We have watched the 60 plus we now have on DVD several times. This is our favorite DVD set. Our only complaint is the excessive time it takes to get the shows out on DVD in the USA after they are produced and shown in the UK.
4,Only three episodes!,"I have all the sets but I'm disappointed that there are only 3 episodes in this set. It is padded out with a 4th disc containing a documentary about Midsomer. It's a nice little documentary, but no substitute for what should have been a 4th episode instead. All three episodes are very good, as usual. I hope set 16 will contain the usual 4 episodes though!"
2,Wrong DVD included and omitted,"I received two ""Blood Weddings"" and no ""Shot at Dawn"". I previously complained about this but have received no response. I am still waiting for a correction."
2,reruns,I really love the series but this set had shows from earlier set in it and I already had them so I already watched them. I was very disappointed. Set 15 was actually a waste of time and money. I was happy with set 14.
4,Terrific but...,"The only reason that I did not give this set a five-star rating is that one of the episodes in it is not an episode, but a ten-year retrospective. While I quite enjoyed the review, I felt that they should have given us four actual episodes and included the retrospective as a fifth bonus disc. That having been said, the episodes that they do include are the usual outstanding fare."
1,Very Disappointing,"We own all sets before 15 & this set is NOT the quality as produced in the past. No mystery, no intrique, just a bunch of idiotic characters & no story line. To make it short, the last man in the wheel chair did it(Shot at Dawn), soooooooo obvious. I can see why John Nettles is leaving. With stories like this (very low class) & surrounded by bad writers, I would leave too. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,Behind the Scenes,"I ordered 3 sets, 14,15, and 16 and found that in set 15, I only had 3 stories, the 4th CD was about the actors,(which I already know) and behind the scenes. It would have been nice to know in advance about series 15, not enough detail in the description. For me, it was a wasted DVD. I haven't opened set 16, but I hope to find 4 complete stories - I have also advance ordered series 17, so I hope the same is so - 4 mystery cases.Linda Holroyd"
5,Murder Mystery,From season one to season fifteen this series keeps on going. My family and I thoroughly enjoy these programs. Well worth the watch!
4,Awesome Praise and Worship Album,"I would highly recommend this album to anyone. Judy is a spectacular praise and worship leader. For those of you who may not be familiar with the name you can surely remember her voice as the praise and worship leader from the Saints in Praise collection (West Angeles Church of God in Christ -- Bishop Charles E. Blake). Each song is anointed and will uplift, inspire and motivate you. Yet they are simple melodies that are easy to learn and will ring in your ear over and over again. You will often find yourself singing a tune from this album as you're getting ready in the morning, working, driving, etc.If you haven't purchased this album yet -- do it!! You will not be disappointed."
5,A True Blessing To God's Heart!,"If you want to hear praise and worship that will move you to praise God, with all that you've got, I would highly recommend that you buy this CD - enter into a time of consecrated praise and worship. This lady has been dubbed the ""The First Lady of Praise & Worship"", and now I know why. If the title song, Send Judah First, doesn't cause your spirit to want to praise God, I don't know what will! Sis. Judith definitely ""praises with understanding"". I was also blessed to be at the latest live recording for her upcoming CD/Video. Towards the end of the evening, she was down on her knees, shoes off, still praising the Lord. Talk about being an anointed vessel, fit for the Master's use!"
5,A Live Praise and Worship Experience that YOU can join!!!,"Oh boy....how can I start???When I first got this CD, the only song I would listen to was ""Like The Dew"". Now almost 3-4 months later, the Lord's prescence on the CD got to me, and now you can find me flipping to favorite songs (""Behind the Veil"", ""Everybody Dancin'"", We Honor You're name""), or just letting the whole CD play through. If you really want to access the prescence of God, and have him come into your home, into your car, or wherever you are, GET THIS CD. It will Bless you in tremendous ways. Thanx to you, and God Bless you Mrs. Christie-McAllister, and keep on singing for God! YOUR SONGS OF PRAISE AND ENCOURAGEMENT ARE BEING HEARD, AND TAKEN TO HEART"
5,Judith is awesome.,This lady is my favorite praise and worship artist.She is doing something that no other artist is doing today.She moves before a performance and takes you right into the presence of the Lord.Buy everything she has produced!
5,BZE...COGIC,This album is a must have. Relaxing and soothing music....I played out this album I have many favorite tracks..One of my favorites is Selah..you need to buy it..trust me Insipirational Gospel Music
5,SO UPLIFTING!!!,"I bought this CD after hearing the testimony of one of my friends and after reading the reviews here on Amazon.com. All of the reviews were right: this is a wonderful Praise & Worship album!!! I listen to this when I wanna get my ""dance on"" (try 'Oh Give Thanks' or 'Send Judah First'), and when I just want to get closer to the Lord (e.g. 'A Worshipper's Prayer'). I plan to buy the video next so I can SEE what went on during this worship experience. Do not hesistate to purchase this record!!!"
5,A Real Worship Experience,"SEND JUDAH FIRST is a powerful collection of songs that focuses the listener on who God is. The stylish and tasteful songs with great instrumentation and singing gives each song its own unique flavor. These songs will change your perspective of worship. Excellent, powerful and life changing!!!!!! I also recommend her lastest album RAISE THE PRAISE!!!!"
1,disappointed,I'm disappointed because i still have not rec'd my cd. this is the first time this has happened to me. IDK what happened to my order.
5,OUR FAVORITE SAUCE,"I am so happy Amazon now sells this sauce. If you try it, you will never go back. There is such a complex, rich chipotle-infused flavor! We love it on ribs, hamburgers, and french fries. We have many open bottles of other rejected BBQ sauces but keep buying more Big Acres Hot and Spicy."
5,The fish is God......,"I havn't read this book since I was six but that is beyond the point! It is the best book of all time! Every person between the age of 2 and 7 should read this. It is an awsome book, Seuss is brilliant!"
5,An Old Standby,"I can't count the times that I have read this old standby to my children. They are grown now, but never seemed to get enough of it when they were little. It is simple, yet mesmerizing. Dr. Seuss sure got it right when he created this classic. It is a must read, and I will read it many more times to my grandchildren and great-grandchildren."
4,The Cat In the Hat,The Cat In the Hat is a fiction story that rhymes about two kids who can't go out and play because its to wet outside. During the story their gets house gets destroyed by 10 little cats in hats called things. He lets them in one by one to help clean up the house but ends up destroying it even more. The main characters are wasThe Cat In the Hat which has really tall hat and has a bowtie around his neck. Sally who is a young girl with short hair with a bow in it and a young boy but they don't tell his name. The setting is a house and it is daylight. The author tells the story in 1st person point of view. I think this book whould be even better if it wasn't so long.
3,The Cat in the Hat - Review,This book is great for young children learning to read. The words in it aren't very hard and it has some childish humor. The rhyming that Dr. Seuss incorperates into his books is very catchy.
3,The Beggining Beginner Book,"The Cat in the Hat shows the bored children how to have fun in the house on a rainy day.The fish is naturaly worried about this intruder(and fish are afraid of cats anyway)but the Cat also shows the children a very important lesson-after the fun is done,we should always clean up.I heard it was hard for Seuss to write this because he had to stick to words that already existed and refrain from making up words,as he usualy did.He might think of neat names for things,but he had to stick with Thing One and Thing Two.Beginner Books-which all children can learn to read through-have been written ever since by Seuss and other authors."
2,Frightening book for children,"The Cat in the Hat is quite a disturbing book considering how young its audience is. This giant mutant cat shows up at the house while mom is out and proceeds to touch and play with everything while the kids look on in terror. They try to get this strange intruder to leave without success, and the cat proceeds to release two ""things"" which tear around the house, destroying everything. Sure, the cat cleans up everything in the end, but if you or I did this, we'd be lucky to be arrested and not shot on sight. I would expect children to have nightmares from this story."
1,Not the classic I remember!,This is NOT the movie I thought it was going to be. The person from amazon that wrote a review was WAY off. If you are looking for the classic Cat in the Hat that was animated with fun music this NOT it. I bought it after reading the Amazon review and was very disappointed. It's someone reading the book..same pics from the book. If I could return this movie I would. My 3 yr old has watched it more that once that's why it gets 1 star.
2,Soft cover????,"I somehow missed that this book is soft cover and not the standard hardcover like all the other Dr. Seuss books. I didn't feel that the audio CD was worth it to have a software version of the book, so I returned it. I thought the book would get destroyed easily and would not stand the test of time like those I had as a kid that were passed down to me from my siblings. I haven't ordered the hard cover version yet, but from now on I will always make sure the description says hard cover."
3,The Cat in the Hat,"In this book two little kids are stuck inside the house all day because it is raining out and they cant go out and play. Their mother is gone for the day. As they are sitting in the house staring out the window something walks in the door, it was the Cat in the Hat! He asks the kids why they are sitting there and doing nothing, he says that he has a fun game to play. The Cat in the Hat makes a big mess with Thing 1 and Thing 2.The lesson that the book teaches is that u always need to clean up after yourself and u wont get in trouble with your parents, and not getting in trouble is a very good thing.The age level for this book is 6-11 because this book is a little more advanced. I would recommend this book to kids that like rhyming books because this book does a very good job of keeping the rhyming going."
5,I want this cat for a friend!,"Have you ever had a cat visit your house and make a BIG mess while your mother was gone? Well, the kids in this book have! I don't need a cat to make MY room all messy, it is messy enough already!"
4,Good book for children,"I read this book to my children and they enjoyed it. It is not the best book I have read to my children, but a good one. They found the pictures very entertaining and funny. I would recommend this book to others to read to their children. I enjoyed it myself also."
1,This is horrible,"A classic book, this movie is a disaster. By the way, I dont remember the book talking about dirt hos."
1,DREADFUL!,"Unless you look back fondly on shows like Clutch Cargo, or if there is absolutely *NO* chance you will ever actually read the book to your child(ren), then --by all means-- avoid this absolutely dreadful video book.Not animated in any sense of the word. It's hard to find even one nice thing to say about it...impossible, in fact.Do yourself a favor: save the money, buy a copy of the book, and read it to your kids...they'll appreciate it more."
1,Where is the music?,"This is not the same ""Cat in the Hat"" classic - there are NO songs, just a terrible reading of the book, a bunch of still pictures and a whiny fish to boot! (I much prefer Mr. Krinklebaum from the original) The reviewer rating above must assume that this is the classic original. The only reason it even gets one star is that my three year old found it midldy entertaining - only because we have read the book so many times! She did not, however, jump and dance like she does to the other - ..."
1,Read the fine print . . .,"Not what we were expecting . . . my husband apparently didn't read the review when ordering this DVD. It is not the musical version most are familiar with, but rather a static, voice-over of the book. I don't see the point to such a product . . . it basically is doing what a parent should do, which is read the book! Spend your money on the hardcover book rather than this DVD, or wait for the muscial version to be released in Oct."
1,Timeless Classic for Young Children,"My parents read this book to me. Now, I read it to my four year old son.He loves it. The repetition and rhymes enthrall young children. If you purchase this title, be prepared to read it over and over again to your little ones."
1,El Gato Cabizbajo,"Deservedly out of print. The spanish translation does not do justice to the story, being a literal word-by-word translation that destroys the rhythmic, poetic character of Seuss's classic. Likely to make a child think English is fun, lively language and Spanish a dull, pedantic one."
1,Wrong Version,"!STOP!There is a 99% chance that this ""video"" is NOT what you think it is. Misleading in its packaging and borrowing glowing user reviews from the hardcover book, this is actually a sad substitute (read ""rip-off"") for the 1971/72 classic. This one is not animated in the way most people think of animated films. Instead, it shows static graphics from the book art ""moving"" around on the screen as if you had cut them out and were sliding them around with your hands. I was super-eager to purchase this for my 2-year old (and myself), but was sadly disappointed at the change in format. They need to make a clearer distinction between this and the original animated classic.If you are looking for that great, original, animated, musical version from childhood, you most likely wantDr. Seuss: The Cat in the Hat[DVD] orDr. Seuss - The Cat in the Hat (Original Television Episode) [VHS] instead."
5,The Cat in My Hat,"The Cat in the hat was a great book. Its funny and creative, capturing the image of Dr Seuss. Whenever it starts raining, I think of the cat in the hat out in the rain. It inspires me to keep reading in my future. I hope it's an inspiration to everyone as much as it was to me!""It is the greatest book I have ever read!"" says Chester Snapdragonmcfistacups, 12""jdklfjdk kjhd""(cool book!) says lkdfjakdjf jdfk age 12"
5,A must have on your bookshelf!,"I grew up with Dr Suess books so I couldn't wait to share them with my own children. The books are illustrated simply, the text is easy to read and creatively laid out and the silly rhymes make me and my children laugh.What I've noticed from reading them Dr Suess books (they are 1 and 2.5 years) that it has really helped my 2.5 year old with increasing her vocabularly, saying words properly and recognising sounds that a letter or group of letters make. A wonderful series of books to read aloud to your children."
4,The Cat or a menace?,"I really like this children's book because its not too short and not too long. Also, it would be good for kids because it rhyhmes through out the whole book. I think this book relates to kids and how they just always want to try and have fun and sometimes get into a little mischief while they are doing it. I like how the ending just kind of leaves you hanging to make up your own."
5,Who doesn't Love Suess,Classic! I bought this for my Grandkids and they look at me like I am crazy when I read it to them. i had fun times with my kids and The Cat in the Hat and it looks like I will have fun with my Grandkids and The Cat in the Hat.....
5,"My daughter is only 21 months old, and this seems to be her favorite book","This story is not only fun to read, my daughter loves it. I have a stack of children's books, and she most often chooses this one first. The art is cool, so that might have something to do with it. My daughter points at the various objects, and has fun naming them. This book has been a winner since day one."
2,chills you to the bone,"I confess I was deeply disturbed by Seuss's parable, which pits the soul-crushing wickedness of a Satanic character (""Cat"") against the unspoiled innocence and naivety of two suburban children.Things come to a head when ""Cat"" seems on the point of morally subverting the universe itself, in a series of feats so nihilistic that the children are reduced to little more than blubbering idiots.True, ""Cat,"" in a whimsy, stays his paw at the end. But I can't help wondering if the children were so harrowed by the experience that they were ever after unable to return to the bright world above."
1,Psychological Damage.,"Dr Seuss was an evil genius, bent on traumatising children.As a child, his books used to terrify me. Particularly The Cat in the Hat, as well as the sinister Thing duo.Unless you're children are aficionados of Stephen King, I urge you to avoid this title."
3,Poor quality,"I am not particularly happy with the audio quality of this CD. There is a lot of noise that should not be there. The original recording was done in 1969 and it should have a lot less noise than there is.The stereo separation is extreme, which was often done in those days but could probably have been fixed in the remastering process; the organ and drums are hard right, the guitar and bass hard left. This varies a bit between tracks but is most prominent on Time is Tight; some tracks have instruments center but the bass and drums are always hard panned. Combined with the noise this makes it hard to listen to with headphones."
4,Good Thing,"I liked this product. I got it for my birthday. It was only 10 dollars, so I thought I got my money's worth. I will tell you this, IT IS NOT A WIRELESS PHONE. It looks like it on the cover, but you plug it into a phone jack."
1,Wastse of money,I bought this thing a month ago. Now the ear buds are broke so I can't use the phone.Above all that the alarm clock doesn't work because the stupid organizer's sound died out and the batteries weren't dead.I paid like $20 for this thing.This product is a total ripoff.
2,Great Scares for the whole family,"Although it's admittedly a b/c horror flick it was adequately creepy and had the rare and pleasantly surprising feature of no extremely foul language or overly suggestive adult situations. The whole family can watch this one without getting offended.Careful though, the little ones won't want to turn out the lights for a month! ;-)"
5,Fear of the Dark,"What a surprise. I love a good scary movie!! This one was a sensational spooker. Far better than I ever expected. Do not miss it, if you like horror shows. I've seen a whole lot of scarry shows and very few are any good at all, but this movie will keep you glued to the screen. It has some really cool music to go with it,too. I searched all over for its theme, but I never found it. If you miss this show, you'll miss out on a great movie. I've never seen one quite like it."
2,Nice Horror,"This movie was made in 2002, if you watch the extra behind the scenes stuff Rachel Skarsten mentions she filmed her pilot for Birds of Prey earlier in the year which was done in 2002.Nice little horror movie, somewhat creepy but no gore or sex or slasher blood. Just good suspense of the old kind.I rented this because of Rachel Skarsten, it's one of the few movies she has done and was impressed with her character. Liked how she calmed the boy down and was supportive instead of condemming."
1,WARNING!,"This movie is for 9 year-olds.Little brother sees monsters no one else sees. Big brother tells him he's crazy.This goes on for 50 excruciating minutes. BORING.And the ""monsters"" are lame.Nothing ever really happens.The end."
1,NOT a good show,Super Slow. Not much action. but at least they paid tribute to the Evil Dead. NO gore. No Boobs. Just kids running around the house.
1,Awful,"This movie just ripped off darkness falls and it even failed at doing that. It's really about helping friends, not turning your back like a punk!"
3,FLAWFUL & SILLY BUT VERY SCARY AT TIMES !,"The monsters in this film & a couple of really creepy artistic scenes are what saves this one from being a hollow story horror flop. they also could have done without the silly special efx! Other than that when all is said & done the spooky jolts, tingles & visuals this movie gives you makes it all worth it in the end."
4,It IS a rip-off...but not of Darkness Falls...,"First of all, I know Amazon says this came out in 2002, but I looked at the dates on the movie itself, and its a movie from 2004. Whoops, Amazon!Second, the movie that this mainly copies is Wes Craven's 'THEY' which was also copied by, you guessed it, 'Darkness Falls'(I won't even go into how awful that movie was).I'm not the person to get scared by most movies, and this one was no exception. However, the acting was decent, the plot was pretty good, and there are a few well done suspense scenes, as well as one helluva jump moment that gave even my boyfriend and me a jump.So, my advice is, rent it first. If you find it at a decent sale, buy it!"
2,children might like it,really saw no point in this movie.Not scary-not entertaining.The acting was good but the movie went nowhere.For what it had to present it was too long.
3,Fear of the Dark,"The acting is a little off,long, and it doesn't go along as fast I would like, but it's a fun scary film to watch and a logical idea for a movie,who wasn't afraid of the dark or hasn't been or still might be? I enjoyed it especially towards the end."
3,"Decent, nothing more, or less.","Not a bad film. 3 star worthy I feel, which to me basically means a movie is solid, worth watching once, but by no means is it a film that has significant power.However, to me, It's just not in my wiring to be someone who would go ""half-way"" with a project. In other words, if my goal is to make a ""scary"" movie, than by god all stops will be pulled in this attempt to make just that. A scary movie.This movie, however, basically goes ""half-way"". If the goal was to make a ""kid-friendly"" horror movie, than I suppose mission accomplished. Not near ""dark"" enough or raw for my liking. Very hollywood-ish, and too ""clean, pure and kiddy"" for my taste. But....It's a decent film with some value. It's just dark enough to warrant adults a bit of entertainment, but do NOT expect anything other than what I have stated if you are an adult who truly seeks out genuinely good ""scary"" movies."
2,Took too long to get anywhere,"I watched this cause the reviews saying it was like ""Darkness Falls"" which, to this day, still creeps me out lol So I thought ""Why not?"" Not even close! Took a HOUR IN to see anything really scary. Honestly I kept waiting for them to say the kid is crazy. The 12 year old was annoying and wasn't very good. The older brother's girlfriend was pointless. One thing that popped into my head was ""This kid is lucky he has rich parents cause if he had middle class or lower he'd be screwed if it was real!"" I mean I'm glad the boy has such caring parents and older brother, but in the end, a waste of 1hr30mins. Oh well."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"This movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Darkness Falls was a much better movie then this and Darkness Falls was horrible too! this movie went nowhere and the actual monsters in the movie was maybe shown...twice for a total of 47 seconds. Very bad movie that wasn't scary or well thought out. Yea, little ones will be scared of this movie but then again littles ones get scared at the sight of lmost anything and this movie is far worse that almost EVERYTHING!!"
1,BOOOORING!,"I must have missed where they labeled this movie a kids' movie. If you want a clean, gore-free horror movie for kids, this is your choice. I kept waiting ... and waiting ... and waaaaaaiting for something, anything to happen. Nope. I finally fast forwarded through and around 1:15 a few apparitions/monsters started making an appearance. Otherwise, the entire thing is a couple of kids wandering around a darkened house at night. If you're an adult and must watch this, I suggest you do the same. Fast forward to the last ten minutes of the movie and save your time. Calling this movie lame is being kind."
3,ehh,"There is a power outage and this kid has a severe fear of the dark, his brother (who is babysitting during the outage) starts getting scared of the dark, his brother's girlfriend gets scared of the dark too, some very cheesy patches of darkness and ghosts chase them around, they turn on the flood lights and they all live happily ever after. The end. Wasn't very scary. I would reccomend it for a younger audience looking for a scare though. ;-)"
4,Creepy Fun,"I just sat through ""Night of Komodo"", ""Python"" and ""Savage Island"", all direct to video horror, all lousy beyond definition, and so I figured what the hell?.....might as well pop in ""Fear of the Dark"", I mean if i could make it through ""Savage Island"" everything else will be Macbeth by comparison. ""Fear of the Dark"" starts off pretty well, with a kid retrieving a lost baseball in a dark basement, and just sort of carries you along on a cool little thrill ride where things really do go bump in the night. The young actors really do a good job, and the movie does a pretty decent job of building suspense in several parts. If you liked ""Clownhouse"", then you should enjoy ""Fear of the Dark"" as well. No gore, no nudity and very little profanity also makes ""Fear of the Dark"" a kid-friendly horror film (if there is such a thing in our politically correct world anymore??) and would be perfect for your teen's next slumber party."
2,"Has some moments, but ..","This is most definitely an ""under 10 Dollar"" film. I had not seen the film, and bought the disc based on the cover and a quick look at the cover blurb, cost was just under 20 dollars ... not worth it.There are some quite good scares at points, but thats about it. Definitely a kiddie horror, say a 3 year old, sort of film. If you get spooked by R L Stine, then you are beyond this film.Some rather good editing at the final moments brings some neat scares; but, like the first in the SCARECROW films ( where the Actor playing the Scarecrow actually made his own mask) this is a film that should be avoided if you have any other options AT ALL.AVOID."
3,simple horror/suspense flick,"This movie wasn't bad...Felt more like watching a modern-day halloween episode made for an after school special...It was a clever film, taking the idea of being afraid of the dark and making a simple, suspense film....more suspence than horror, though there were a few creatures in it that popped up...The acting was ok...Surely not a gorefest, but the movie has you thinking back to those times when you were a kid and thought things bumped in the night, lived in your closest and under your bed...PG-13? it could've been PG=nothing graphic found in this movie at all (to tell you the truth, seen more graphic stuff on prime time tv, lately)..."
3,Incomplete,The author does a good job covering the general history of the Jews (Ashkenazi) in New Mexico who came after the opening of the Santa Fe trail and mostly after the arrival of the Americans and the Mexican-American War. The book is woefully outdated concerning the Spanish Jews of New Mexico (extremely out dated chapter 1). This book is in serious need of an update and expansion. (really deserves about 3 1/2 stars)
1,this is false advertising,I ordered this item I did not receive the case and the card dose not work on the wii ferther more the text describing it says its made by Nintendo which it is not. (notice how they conveniently show the cards back side to not show the sticker?) the wii can only use cards of 2 gig or less which they don't tell you in the owners manual you have to look it up on the INTERNET
2,Not enough info,"This DVD is a recording of one of Mad Money's episodes. The ""Back to Basics"" title should be taken seriously, as this is too basic for anyone who has watched more than a couple of episodes already. If you really want to know how Mad Money works, get the book ""Jim Cramer's Mad Money; Watch TV, Get Rich"". It's got way more useful information in it than the short TV show ""Mad Money with Jim Cramer - Back to Basics"", and will reward your time spent with it."
1,Does not play,I purchased this CD and have tried it on two different DVD players as well as my computer DVD player and it does not work!!! Mine also looked like a copy. Don't waste your money!
3,Of historic value,"In the mid 1990ies when beading became popular, there were few books around. At the time this was one of two books by this famous author and bead historian.Now a new beading book comes out every day practically. So the contents of this book are not the latest rage. Imagine a book without lots of Japanese seed bead projects!It is more about historic, ethnic beads, large beads, handmade uneven beads, and classics. This book would appeal more to collectors, and bead historians than new beaders who are into Austrian crystals, and 3D seed beading projects that are very popular now.A practical set of suggestions for combining bead colors is on page 119 ""Designing with Colour in Bead Jewellery"" section. (Yes, the author is British and uses British spellings.) I found this helpful as a beginning beader."
4,Solid and accurate saw for a professional woodworker,"Carpenters as well as homeowners who care about quality tools will appreciate this saw for it's power and accuracy. I find this table saw easy to transport from truck to jobsite yet it's fullsize enough to handle every task needed. Table adjustments are easy and accurate. Some details could use improvement such as a storage bracket to attach saw cord for transport, an adjustable leg on the stand for uneven ground, and the black fence sometimes forbids good sight that the stock is flush to fence at all times. Comparing all portable saws on the market, Porter Cable to me is the best no frills or gimmicks, rugged, jobsite to jobsite saw available."
4,Rod that tightens fence has broken twice in 10Mons of use.,"I use this saw every day on the job.Very portable easy set up and stable.Has good power, rpms a little slow but still does a good job. Fence is smooth,extention works good.The only problam is the rod that tightens the fence is to small. Broke it twice in 10 mons.@ about 20$ a piece to fix."
4,old faithful,"6 years of hard use and still going strong! Literally miles of wood pushed though this machine.I've been a finish carpenter for almost 15 years and as co-workers have come and gone i've had the opportunity to use every portable table saw on the market. All have parts designed to fail with use (how else can they get you to buy the next model), but the Achilles heel seems to be fence systems. The fence on this is well made and adjusts to perfection easily. The action of the fence is still smooth due to its simple design. If the saw takes a hit adjustment screws allow you to compensate. Motor is well powered and brake still working.Only reason I didn't rate this five stars is because of some plastic parts that have caused me some issues (plastic gear that adjusts bevel wore out and was replaced. Saw is heavy but this also keeps it relatively stable. Damn shame PC sold itself out and stopped making this and many of its other older fine machines."
4,Great saw,Purchase this saw to replace an old Sears table saw that died after 20 years... LOVE the saw... the only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 stars was related to the base... could be better...
4,Great for spot welds,I do a lot of spot welding on sheet metal fabrication. These Flap Disc work great. They they remove the flash from the spot weld and leave a nice surface good enough for powder coating.
5,Great music!,We listen to the CD on our way to school in the morning. The girls (ages 10 and 7) absolutely love. AWESOME CD!
4,"older version, but matches what I had.","Fast service and no problems with product. This is an older version, Wireless-B, but I wanted to match it with one on another computer I already had been using. It was a cinch to set up and works fine."
2,forth,Worked well upon receipt. Became a 5 minute temporary wireless start-up connection when IE ver 7 was downloaded. After that practically useless; tried every method of wireless software option. Never got to file or printer sharing. Regards Jim
3,Ugh.,"Works fine with my Win98SE comp, the total install took about 5 minutes.. The WEP stuff is a little messed up, you cant define 4 different WEP keys, they all change back to the same one if you try.Don't even try to use this with any operating system other then windows.. there are no drivers for this version. Find the v2.6 adapter, not v2.8. I've tried OS's ranging from FreeBSD to Slackware.. and have yet to get anything working with this."
2,DOA,"Linksys USB Wireless adaptor looks nice... but that's about it. Was dead right out of the box. After installing software and connecting, power LED lights up, but computer doesn't even detect the wireless adaptor. I tried the adaptor on 2 other computers to make sure that it was the Linksys adaptor that was at fault. By the way, I'm an IT professional and I have experience with wireless equipment so I know what I'm doing. I've had problems with Linksys equipment in the past. When it works, its great... Linksys has made too many defective equipment for me to recommend this to other people. Not including this adaptor, I've also had problems with 2 Linksys Wireless Access Point/Router(BEF11S4) and 1 linksys wireless access point(WAP11). Netgear equipment in my experience seems to be a lot more reliable with similar prices.note: I have determined that the USB cable that came with the wireless adaptor as at fault. It seems they shipped a whole batch of wireless adaptors with defective USB cables."
2,very unstable,"I suggest that if you can, buy a pc or pci card. This usb adapter is very unstable. I have to restart my windows xp computer atleast twice a day. The only advantage to this is that you can put it in the spot with the best signal, whereas in a pc or pci card it is stuck inside your computer and you cant move it very easily."
3,Don't trust techies at Lynksys!,"This works fine with our PC. Unfortunately, I ordered after consulting with the tech dept at Lynksys. I gave them all of the specifics on our 2 PCs AND 2 MACS, and was assured that this was the item. Well, almost [price]later, after a call to them, it turns out that they don't have drivers for any Mac OS.So Caveat Emptor!"
3,Not Vista compatible,This product works great under Win XP but won't allow a normal Restart or Shutdown under Vista. Great value if you have XP and don't need network speed above 11 Mbps
1,"Very often, the connection is lost.","The installation was fairly simple, after being gone through the experience of the installation (and trouble shooting) of the main router(befw11s4).However, my remote PC was only about 20 feet and a drywall away from the main router, the connection has been very unstable. The wireness communication between the remote PC and the main router only works, in average, one out of five times.I heard that the newer version (ver. 2.5) works better. I am going to replace mine with the new version (specially with the newly-attached antena) and see if it improves the wireless network performance.I do not recommend the older version that does not come with the attached antena."
3,"Everything's ok, but the range is very poor","I used this in a home setup between 2 PCs, in conjunction with the etherfast wireless access point BEFW11S4 and the above mentioned network adapter. The range was much worse than I expected. If there is a standard brick wall blocking both appliances, the signal strength could fall by almost a quarter to a half! If that is the case, I don't know how the signal could pass through one floor."
1,It simply didn't work.,"I use a Linksys wireless router, which works perfectly with my notebook's wireless PCMCIA card (made by Linksys). I naturally expected to have no problem with the wireless USB adapter ... but no luck at all! The configuration routine for the USB hub doesn't duplicate the capability of the configuration routine for the hub --- I couldn't input a security phrase and generate a 64-bit WEP ""key"" to match the one programmed into the hub. When I disabled WEP on both the hub and the USB adapter, or manually duplicated the key, there was still no joy."
3,NOT for TiVo,"I bought this adapter for a series 2 TiVo, but it is version 4 which does not work with TiVo. Here's a link to the TiVo website for a list of adapters. http://customersupport.tivo.com/knowbase/root/public/tv2006.htm?#wirelessI'm giving it 3 stars because I hooked it up to an older computer running XP sp2, and it was easy to configure, but kept dropping the link. It was only a couple of rooms away from the router and had an excellent signal strength. There could be reasons for this problem which are not related to this adapter, but I have not had this trouble with a different adapter in my laptop in any room of the house. You may not have any trouble with this adapter for your PC, but do not buy it for TiVo."
3,Working Fine,It took a few customer service calls before it started working on my Win 98 system. It is working fine now.
2,Works fine but not the WEP under XP,"It took me 5 minutes to set up the unit on my XP Pro machine. Everything worked fine if WEP was not considered. However, security is a big thing these days - at least to me.After spending almost 4 hours - resetting my SMC router, network settings, etc. It simply would not work with WEP enabled.The unit itself is good. But if you want WEP on XP, you might want to try something else. That's what I am going to do."
3,outdated,"This adapter only supports up to 64bit WEP, and the USB interface means convenience but your computer will also slow down when there's heavy traffic. You can pickup a wireless-G adapter (PCI is better) for about the same price."
4,Overall pretty good,"I have bought two of these - one for my sister and one for myself. The USB adapter had troubles from the very first day I installed it on my sister's computer. It drops the connection every few minutes and has a lot of trouble finding networks. I got it to work well for a few months, but it's been a big fart the last few months again. The one I installed on my own computer works like a charm. I never drops out and gets very strong signals. The speeds are just as fast as if it were wired. I even play FPS games using it and the pings are great. From my experiences, the USB adapter is fairly good, but has given me some headaches.FYI. The router at my place and my sister's place is the exact same (Netgear MR814), so that's not the problem."
2,"not working on XP, 2000, 98SE","i tried to install this USB wireless adapter, but i could not make it. i exactly followed the instruction, and also tried installation on many different machines (Compaq ""new"" presario w/ windows XP, eMachines celeron old one-win98, and Intel-MB w/P4-win2000pro i assembled). After following all steps in the instruction, i plugged in the USB cable, but no machine acknowleged this device. But this device is cute, so use it as a toy. I recommend d-Link USB adapter(it works fine.)"
2,Wrong Cable,I received my shippment today but when i opened the package all three of the network Adapter v4 have the wrong cable. The cable that came with it is a USB with the same end points. It should have came with the usb with is slightly oval not square. Please send me an email regarding this.
5,Love it,I love these items I bought 2 of them and if I had to buy another it will be from Amazon.com. Because they were cheaper than any other place that I went.ThanksLove the item
1,It didn't work.,I spent over an hour with the Linksys tech support in India(during two calls) and they couldn't get the adapter to work. They said that the drivers were bad and that they would send me new drivers on a CD. They never sent them.
3,At least it doesn't work with my Dlink router,"It can't get the correct IP from my Dlink wireless router-DI 614+.(I also have 2 other wireless adapters which work very well)While the monitor software always said it had been connected to the router,but it was not the truth.I have to reboot my computer for many times to make the connection correctly,although once it starts to work everything looks good.After past 3 days' configuration,I found the problem can't be solved,so I decide to return it."
4,Not exactly what I needed... Does not work with TiVo!,"Due to the fact this device has a different chipset, it won't work withTiVo... TiVo's website is partly to blame as well, not indicating theprecise ""version"" of the device: thus, I had to return it and buy anotherone.My seller was more than accomadating in the return/refund however."
4,Just got my linksys set up,"Just received this Linksys wireless USB from 3BTech yesterday. Brand new in retail box. It took me total 3 minutes to set it up with my D-link router. Performed better than the 11a/b/g build-in card came with my Toshiba laptop. I checked after I see other guys' review, it is a version 4, but I do not have a tivo either, big deal. One thing to mention, handsup for 3B. they responded my question quickly and it only took two days for me to receive the package. I dont shop amazon often, but I am difinitely coming back for it."
1,TiVo - No Go!,Don't buy this if your are a TiVo Series 2 owner. Older versions of this adapter worked with TiVo but not the version 4.0 which you'll get from Amazon. You'll now be forced to order the WUSB12 which is $20 more expensive.
3,This is a good product..........but,"I ordered the WUSB11 to connect a TIVO system to my internet. I was sent version 4 of the WUSB11, which isn't compatible with any TIVO service number. How about telling us what version of these products you're selling?"
1,Warning: do not buy this product for Windows XP,"Many reviewers have commented on the ease of use of this product. This may be true for OS's which are not Windows XP. I have spent 3+ hours on the phone over two days with Linksys tech support trying to get this thing working and at the end of it the best answer they could give me was ""reinstall windows"". Some of the problems I have had include failure to install drivers, failure of the wireless to work properly unless the router is set to perpetually broadcast the SSID, and the fact that it just plain stopped working at one point.During the tech support process the tech had me install it on my W2K machine and it worked fine there and the setup was fairly easy...so maybe it's an OK choice if you don't have XP."
1,BEWARE -- v4 not compatible with TIVO!,"Amazon is now shipping WUSB11 v4, not currently compatible with TIVO series 2! Huge bummer. There is no way to order a v2.6 or v2.8 and know for sure what you are getting. This is nothing against this product -- just another problem with Tivo and their support. They may eventually support this unit, but for now the Tivo doesn't recognize the adapter."
1,"If only ""Zero Stars"" was an option","LinkSys's Quality Control has gone to hell in both firmware and hardware. Customer support is abysmal at bestEven LinkSys tech support encourages users to strongly consider using the 2.5 Version of this Hardware (which has an external antenna). The XP driver is highly problematic.Suffice it to say, I will NOT recommend another LinkSys product to clients, colleagues, or friends...Bill Machrone of PC Magazine and ExtremeTech.com has also written about some problems with LinkSys products ...A LinkSys tech support person actually told me that articles and reviews by users will make no difference, because they keep getting editorial awards from publications.I assume they won't mind this review then..Keith"
1,TIVO WARNING,"WARNING - Even though this product is listed by Amazon as a ""customers who purchased ... also purchased"" item - THIS DOES NOT WORK WITH TIVO!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!! LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE!!!"
1,Agony.,"I finally installed the linksys wireless system; the router plus the wireless USB adapter. I have spent upwards of four hours with support personnel, who were unfailingly courteous and anxious to be helpful. The problems are multiple: despite assurances to the contrary there are issues in configuring the system to work with Windows 98 first edition. The signal is weak, despite the fact that the router is only 10' vertically and 20' laterally from the receiving computer. I now have intermittent access to the internet at speeds that are slower than dial up. The whole enterprise has been a black hole for my time and endlessly frustrating. You may well be more fortunate, but if you buy it and it does not function with little effort, cut your losses and return it immediately."
3,Works great until you use the phone!!,"This product works great for me until I pick up my new 2.4 Ghz phone and it kills every one of these Linksys wireless adpaters in the house (I had 3), I can use any of the 900Mhz phones with no problem BUT if you have or plan to get 2.4Ghz wireless products you better stay away from this. I finally gave up and wired my house and solved the problem, its a great product otherwise"
2,"Unsigned, non-working XP drivers","First of all, there are at least two (2) devices, very different in appearance, that are BOTH called WUSB11. I have, apparently, the one without the fold-out antenna pictured above.The Windows ME drivers for this product caused blue-screen errors on my Vaio PCG-FX210 until I finally removed them. The Windows XP driver doesn't appear to work at all (it recognizes the unit, but won't see any networks.) The XP driver is also unsigned, and the installation instructions tell the hapless user to simply ignore the unsigned driver warnings from XP. Since they've had plenty of time to have the driver qualified by Microsoft, my guess is they just haven't gone to the trouble to make it reliable enough to pass Logo testing.For what it's worth, I've relegated this thing to use on an older machine running Windows 98, and it seems stable enough in that configuration.Maybe the ""other"" WUSB11 and its drivers are more stable.Scott"
2,Unresolved problems with Win98,"This unit is so good in so many ways, I really wanted to give it a positive review. In general, I have been very satisfied with other Linksys products. Unfortunately, the driver refuses to load properly after a reboot (a frequent occurance on Win98). The only fix I found was to unplug and then plug-in the USB cable after every reboot or stand-by. I very tedious process! Tech support simply told be to repeatedly re-install the software, which never worked. Naturally, by the time I finally concluded there was no way to fix the problem, It was past the point where I could simply return it.However, once the driver is running, It seems to work fine."
4,Great Product but does not work for Tivo,I bought this for my Tivo because it was listed as an accessoryfor a Tivo series 2 that I bought. Better check the Tivo website for supported wireless adapters if your going to use this for Tivo.http://customersupport.tivo.com/knowbase/root/public/tv2006.htm?
1,Horrible! Don't buy!,"Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage!!! I've had so many problems with this things it's ridiculous! Despite calling customer service three times, this this just doesn't work properly. It constantly finds ""new networks"" around my neighborhood and kicks me offline each time. I'm throwing mine away and buying from a different company! My friend has the same problem with his. Also, the User Manual is completely useless!!! Stay away from Linksys"
2,Almost worked with xp,"I had it going for about 36 hours. Unfortunately when I returned after 4 hours, it was unable to send. Yet I was able to ping my computer using both a computer on the same network, and even using my cell phone. But not even my firewall was able to detect any outbound activity. So I returned it.Some other problems I found was xp seemed to lose the card, and using detect new hardware would not even detect it. I ended up having to uninstall and reinstall. There are just way too many issues that were similiar to when I tried version 2.6 with 98."
1,Drops connection too often,This just doesn't work that well. The connection drops every 15-30 minutes.
2,Works with some versions of windows....otherwise: forget it,"It is a great system and works well with *most* version of windows. It does NOT work with Windows XP Pro. Their service number is almost impossible to find. When we did call, they knew about the problem with it not working with Windows XP pro but could do nothing to help us.It also didn't work well with my husbands computer...it kept cutting out. Luckily we have the Linksys Router where we can have both wired and wireless connections. Only one of our three computer uses this adapter. The one thats on it works great with no problems...but the other two computers won't work with it. And the people at the company could not or would not help us, even after we dumped [$$$]into their products to get the wiresless system in our household."
3,"very good reception, but has severe lag problem!","I own this adaptor for 2 years, it's version 2.6 (the cable has same style plug both sides)I use xp, driver install is easy, just follow the special instruction for xp usersit has EXCELLENT reception, 20-30 meters more distance than other pc card adpatorsbut it has SEVERE problem, that it disconnect and re-connect every several minutes under ""low"" reception, makes bad lagging, espcially when listening streaming radio and watching streaming video, this is very annoyingother that, the antenna is so fragile, luckily the reception don't change when in recessed position (probably because of its plastic finish)if you're planning to get it for xp, get MS MN710USB instead, the reception is not as good as this, but no lag problem"
3,DO NOT USE FOR ONLINE GAMING WITH WinXP,"The configuration utilities that ship with Linksys wireless products will not install/run properly on WinXP, Linksys requires you to use the WinXP Wireless Zero Configuration (WZC) service. One feature of WZC is that once every minute it will drop the current signal in search of a better one, resulting in constant, annoying interruptions to your online play. Thus, if you try to use Linksys wireless products for online gaming, prepare to be VERY annoyed. Otherwise, the product seems to work fine for normal web browsing."
1,I can't get it to work to save my life...,"I would have giving it no stars if all possible. I spent my money with the hopes that it would make my life easier, no. I can't get it to install at all. i tried installing it a computer with windows xp, got the new drivers and all. Nope. I tried it on a computer with windows millenium, nope. easy install is a joke. I tried to install it ever way i could think of, I tried forcing the drivers and all, but on both systems it just comes up as an unknown usb device and won't even install period, much less me having any comment on speed or reliability.... get something else from linksys or maybe another company all together."
1,Non Compatible,I should have read the reviews before purchasing it. Why would someone sell the item as a package when the package is not compatible? I guess I now have a paper weight that is black and blue. How about thinking before selling!
3,good but not great,I like Linksys a lot but I'm a little dissappointed in the USB card adapted. I run my laptop that has built in wireless side by side with my desktop that doesn't. I get 54mbps on my laptop but only 11mbps with my desktop.
1,Difficult to set up,I have had a very frustrating and difficult time setting up this adaptor.Still does not work. Many emails to Linksys. They told me to start all over setting up my router .... when I have time I will try it again.The price was right ... but it needs to set up easily!
1,"Bad, very bad, very very bad","In three months, have had four Linksys routers, and three adapters due to faulty equipment. It took hours on the phone with abrasive, sarcastic tech support to figure this out. And, to add insult to injury, it's a toll call to get authorization to send this crap back. Stay away from Linksys."
1,V2.6 is the worst,"I've been using the WUSB11 v2.5 for over a year now on an XP box with outstanding results. After recently building a second machine, I purchased a v2.6 only to have horrible results. It turns out the v2.6 is a diffent design and diffent chipset with muuch less capability. While the v2.5 runs at 11Mbs from 40ft away, the v2.6 won't make a reliable connection at 15ft. Linksys finally got it going, after being on the phone for over an hour, by limiting it to 2Mbs max. I tried a second one on two other machines (including my orignial XP box) with the same [bad]performance. If you can find a v2.5 around grab it, you won't be sorry. But stay away from the new v2.6."
1,You get what you pay for....,"This little, cheap device would always drop the connection. You get what you paid for. I went ahead and spent more on a D-Link G with a power booster. Connection is now rock solid"
2,hangs Windows 2000,"Great product for intermittent use, like if you fire up your computer and browse the web, answer email.But if you want a constant long term connection, forget it. After about 100 mb transferred, it hangs your system. I've reproduced this bug, and a normal NIC card gives me no problems. So you are always rebooting every day if you are serving. I even updated the drivers too!There are a couple of other reviewers who have experienced this too.But if you do need it for short-term stuff, it's great!"
5,Works good easy to install good range,"My kids needed to update thier computers and I was tired of unhooking thier computer and bringin them into my office to hook them up to my high speed connect all the time so I got these and I got a wireless router. These made it so much easier to run a network in my house, I was dreading running CAT-5 throug the house, plus, I inadverdantly hooked into the local wireless provider which was almost 1/2 mile away. worked very good."
1,Won't connect TiVo to an 802.11b/g router,"After 2 days of reconfiguring my network (Linksys 802.11B/G router) in every way imaginable & getting no connection from the TiVo with this adapter, I searched the messageboards and discovered this adapter is ""tempermental"" with a combined 802.11b/g router. The TiVo site recomends it, but no one mentioned router compatibility...get the WUSB12 model - worked like a charm in 3 minutes."
3,Great product - except with WinXP,"Ok, it has been 6 months since I last posted this review and I am sorry to report that there has been no improvement! I recently bought the Belkin Wireless adapter and all my problems have disappeared.I bought the BEFW11S4 with two WUSB11 adapters and installation was easy and everything works well on both my Windows 2000 and WinXP machines until I try to play network games. The Windows 2000 machine still works like a dream, but WinXP keeps losing the connection. I have spent weeks talking to linksys support, but they would not admit that there is a problem or even look into it. Their last communication to me was: ""Don't play online games with a wireless network""!If you are not running WinXP (at least, if you are running Windows 2000 :-)), I would recommend this highly. Hopefully linksys can fix their WinXP driver in the near future, but I would steer clear of it until then."
5,Easy as 1-2-3!,"This thing is a godsend. Boys and girls, do not fret, just get it. I live in NYC and I have a friend who lives 3 floors above my apartment. Needless to say, the connection is flawless almost 24/7. I even pickup signals from places 1-2 blocks away at an average signal(Don't forget to use Encryption unless you don't mind people ""stealing"" your bandwidth). If you live in an apartment building and want to share a connection with a friend, or if you have an in-home network, JUST DO IT! You won't regret it, and as for XP problems, none yet. This thing is tiny, efficient and effective. AWESOME!"
1,Not Compatible with TIVO,Beware - version 4 is not compatible with TIVO. I didn't bother to read the reviews before I ordered so now have a paperweight. Several others have pointed out that this item will not work with TIVO
1,XP and this Linksys USB just don't get along,"After struggling with the installation setup for a day and waiting for the Technical support, I finally went on the Linksys support website via my wired LAN connection. The Knowledge database indicated that this device has some technical issues with XP and requires ""try and error"". I have another XP at home with D-Link PCI wireless adapter and it is working just fine. So I decided to not spend more time to troubleshoot this one anymore and return the adapter instead."
1,WARNING to TIVO users,"Despite TIVO's recommendation of this wireless adapter, they don't support version 2.8 (which is apparently the latest version -- and the one that was delivered from Amazon). The TIVO software won't recognize it for whatever reason.The one I ordered previously (version 2.6) works great."
4,WUSB11 v2.8 DOES work with TiVo,"Folks, I got a new WUSB11 v2.8 for Christmas, and I had read all of the reviews concerning the limitations of v2.8. Needless to say, I was really bummed that I was not going to be able to get TiVo on-line. However, all you need to do is logon to your account at tivo.com, tell them that you have a WUSB11 v2.8, and they will push you an update to the TiVo software. It took a couple of days, but after they pushed the new software, I was up and running. No more phone cords, and now I have the Home Media option as well.As for only 4 stars, I'm having a heck of a time getting one of these up and running on an old Win98 machine that I have. I've followed the directions with no luck..."
1,Doesn't work,"Bought it for my son's computer (home for the winter break from college), simply didn't work. Linksys support had nothing to offer, turned out to be defective. Returned it, bought a Netgear USB adapter, plugged it in, and had him online in minutes."
4,works great but needs lockout,"This item works great but it connects any signal it receives, even from the neighbors to the computer. If you unplug your cable modem at bedtime the kids can still run their computers off the neighbors signal. By using the neighbors signal they can also ignore your wireless router that has buit in parental web filtering. This device needs a password protected feature to restrict access to signals other than your own."
1,Support-free hardware that doesn't work,"Bought one of these to add to a relatively complex home network - SMC Barricade router, Linksys wireless router to extend range into other parts of the house, three SMC USB wireless adapters, and a laptop with wireless built in. The Linksys device doesn't work on any machine or OS in the house, failing in unique ways with each one. Three emails to support produced no responses, not even a robot ""we got your email."" Over a half hour on hold when I called...and then disconnected. It looks cool, but don't buy it unless looks are, absolutely, everything. Support matters."
1,not compatable with tivo series 2,this item isnt compatable if you are looking for it to work with a tivo dvr series 2. I am not the only person who has had this problem.
1,Won't work on XBOX 360,"Despite the reviews found here, this device does not work with Xbox 360. I spent an hour on the phone with the Linksys Tech service people to finally find out that this is not compatible with Xbox 360."
2,Stay away from it!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Well, bought it connected it to thee machine. Have linksys router too. Thee DHCP just wouldnt catch on...Have been trying for thee paast 6 months for thee DHCP to work doesnt work So I am now working on static ips.The tech support is as good as non existant. The max knowledge they do have is if you have pluged in the the aadaaptor right.The neeeetowrk adapor software that comes doesnt eeven show the signaal strength in grpahical representation..I will never ever buy a linksys product.. Will next time buy from netgear they seem to be the best. The only reason I boughtt the linksys was because it had cisco on it.In the end stay away from IT!!!!!!!!!"
1,does not work,"Simply does not work. maybe i could have figured it out, but spending 2 hours with it was enough. I run XP and that may be the problem. support was useless. don't buy if you have XP and not a lot of time."
3,This is a reciever not a transmitter!,"This was most likely an error due to not knowing what it was I needed.I had a laptop with a wireless card, and I needed to broadcast the signal to it from my desktop so I could be connected.Turns out I was mistaken -- this is NOT what I needed.However, Amazon made the return process VERY easy and convenient and I will shop again someday when the need arises."
1,3B Tech has terrible customer service,"Do not buy anything from 3B Tech. They will not accept returns for any reason.Use Newegg or Tiger Direct.I am now stuck with an item I cannot use, or re-sell."
1,Don't buy this for Windows Vista,"This device was presented as Vista compatible. As per Linksys it will not work on Vista 64 Bit and unless it is the correct version, it will not work on any Vista product"
4,"Simple, works as its supposed to.","This little gem is simple, plug-and-play, and just works. Don't bother to install the software that came with it, if you know anything about configuring wireless networks you don't need it. The software doesn't make it any easier if you are a novice, so again, don't bother with it.Signal strength is very good, I've got the router upstairs at the other end of the house (about 50-60 feet away). You might have to have the antenna in the up position for max signal however. I've got it permanently set up for my HTPC (no room inside the computer for a PC-card network adapter)."
1,"Worthless drivers, worthless support.","Have 6 of these (all v4), not a single one installed on post sp2 windows xp without tweaking. Their support? Dear god, completely useless.Why is it so hard to release a product with working drivers? Really...Just because there is a workaround, that doesn't excuse Linksys for releasing a shoddy product.Drivers on the website were an older version than what came on the CD. Go Linksys!"
3,Has some problems,"I recently purchased linksys wireless router, linksys cable modem and this USB wireless adapter.While the setup was easy , I had problems from day one .Every day I was on phone with linksys tech support , but they were not able to identify the problem.Finally exchanged the adapter for a new one.Its working better than the first one..but still has some problems.Sometimes the adapter is not able to automatically establish a link to the wireless router.I my case the wireless router and the adaper are just 5 feet apart and just one wall inbetween .Linksys tech support has admitted to have similar problem with the adapter.They suspect its XP compatibility issue."
1,Linksys wusb11,BUYER BEWARE>>>>>This is such a junk. Do not waste yout money on this item. This did not work. Of all the items I have ever purchased on AMAZON this is the absolute worst
4,Great wireless connection,"I had no idea what I was looking for, as I'm new to the PC. I asked the buyer a few questions, which he answered for me and I've had it now for almost 2 years, and it is working great!"
2,"Very flakey device, works...sometimes.","Let me start by saying that I have the version 2.2 of this device, so hopefully the later versions fixed some serious problems.This device works, some of the time. I used it about 30 feet from a Linksys WAP11 device, and it gave me 100% signal strength. Throughout the day, that signal strength would jump radically from 100% to 10% to 0% to 50%. It is extremely flakey, and very very frustrating.I replaced it with a Linksys WET11 device which has a bigger antenna, and so far has worked like a charm 100% of the time. I am in love with the WET11. It's one-time configuration can be daunting to the layman, but once configured, you can connect it to any ethernet equipped device, and not need any other drivers.Do not get the WUSB11 if you can afford the WET11."
3,Not reliable under Win98SE,"I've been running my old Win98SE machine with this for a couple of months, and am about to give up on it. The hardware works great, but the driver software causes Win98SE to crash either within minutes or within a few hours . I methodically tried using five different earlier versions of the WUSB11 drivers from Linksys, but they were even less functional than the current version 4.0 software.The machine in question here is a Dell Pentium-3, 500 MHz, 128 MB RAM desktop."
1,Was not new,It was not in a box as I expected a new product to be. No supporting printed material at all.It did not work. I need to return it.
4,version 4 has the WPA security,Purchased 2 of them and found them to compatible in Win XP. Also version 4 of this adapter supports WPA security which is the strongest encryption than WEP. Linksys tech support doesn't even know about this info. check the wpa certification on wi-fi.org.
5,Works well with TIVO,I bought a series 2 40 GB TIVO recently. I had no phone lines near my TV. My computer is upstairs and had a wireless router from lynksys to connect to another computer at the other end of the house. So I bought this adapter and hooked it up to my TIVO. I set the SSID and password. It started working right away with a good connection (75%). I set up the TIVO desktop on the computer and published by photos and MP3s. I could then view my photos and listen to my MP3s downstairs. It worked great. 5/5 rating.
1,Wusb11 Version 4 not compatable with W98 4.10,Even though the Spec's posted by Amazon states it works with Windown 98 be aware that Linksys Ver. 4 will only work with Windows 98SE and above (Per Linksys Tech Support).Linksys Ver. 2.6 and earler work with Windows 98 1st edition (4.10)and above.Amazon is only shipping WUSB11's with Version 4.0This device also will not work with Tivo series 2.
5,TIVO network,"I bought this adapter to create a wireless TIVO network. After plugging the adapter to the back of the series 2 Tivo recorder and downloading the desktop, I had an instant wireless network. It was set up in minutes and has operated flawlessly."
3,"it works, but isn't the best for all scenarios","this device works as advertised, you can use it where you would expect to. we use ours on our tivo (series 2, 80 hour device). works great there. setup was painless.sometimes we see some packet loss or some lag, and that's where the complaints start. this device works well for loss tolerant situations, but i wouldn't dare put my PC or my laptop on it. the signal quality isn't what you need, and you'll drop more packets (and hence lose speed and waste time) than you care to.so, for something like a tivo, this is great. for something like your home PC or laptop, keep shopping."
2,"When it works it's great, but frustrating when it's down","This adapter is the most frustrating piece of hardware I've ever come across! Beware when using with WinXP....very touchy! Sometimes it works perfectly. Other times it won't connect to the Internet even though it is receiving a perfect signal from the router, which is also Linksys. My Netgear card that I use in my laptop has always worked fine and was cheaper than this lightweight piece of plastic. I would recommend passing on this unless you don't mind spending hours browsing the Linksys website trying to solve your XP compatibility issues. Ack!"
3,"Works great, but not with xp","The range on this is awesome!! At my neighbors house, the link quality and signal strength is in the upper 90% range. I installed this adapter on my computer running windows xp, after much work, I got it to work. The next day, it quit working. It wouldn't get an ip address. I called linksys and had spent hours on technical support, but ti no avail. They recomended that I return it and get another one because it was defective. I tried that and it still didn't work. I installed it on my win me system and it worked immediately. I then tried it on my win xp laptop, but it didn't work. So beware, you may run into complications when installing on a win xp machine. I am very pleased with my other linksys products, just not this one."
2,"A case of the slows, asks non-techie?","I bought a WUSB11 ver. 2.4 used on eBay. This was for a new HP Pavilion a550E (with 64-bit CPU)desktop, running Windows XP Home edition. The pre-existing set-up was: a wireless ISP offering"
4,This product works for me,I have this USB adapter connected to a D-Link AirPlus 614+ AP. It works fine for me.
4,"Works real well, with a couple of oddities...","I got two of these, and a Linksys wireless access point (to go along with the Linksys cable modem and the Linksys router/switch). On a laptop running Windows ME, it installed perfectly just as advertised. On a desktop system running Windows 98SE, it had some installation glitches although after uninstalling and reinstalling four times it did work -- and once it worked, it works great. I suspect there was a conflict with some other software, although nothing told me so and only a little trial and error finally fixed it. Through several walls and a floor/ceiling, I'm getting 100% signal strength, 97% link quality, and 11 Mbps."
2,Causes hardware crashed on High end XP system,"I recently bought a new high end PC system and installed the Linksys WUSB11 wireless adapter.Occassionally my system would freeze completely mostly when I loaded it with intensive disk tasks like combining defragmenting with copying data. At first I suspected outdated drivers and the like, but after almost two weeks of updating, trying and testing I figured out that the system crashes only when the Linksys is attached to the USB port. When I disconnect it my PC becomes 100% stable. I believe these crashes are more frequent when the signal available to the Linksys is in the medium to low range (i.e. when it tries to establish or re-establish connections).Ever since I removed the Linksys WUSB11 my system has been stable as a rock. So I'd advise people to look at other vendors' solutions like Netgear.The silver lining: Linksys got me to update every single driver for every single part of my PC, thank you Linksys."
1,DOA Also,"Just received my USB adapter and it is dead straight out of the box on March 15th. Also tried it on 3 PC's and I am also an IT network administrator. No luck with Windows ME, XP Home and XP Pro. It is a shame as I have several other Linksys products and they all work great...."
2,"Not XP compatible, buyer beware!","I grudgingly use Linksys Instant Wireless series products for my wireless b/g network. This adapter worked fine on my Dell Inspiron laptop running Me, but that was not the computer I purchased it for. The whole point of a USB adapter is to be able to easily move from one machine to another. With different operating systems and this adapter, that is impossible. And Linksys' ""tech support,"" don't even get me started on that nightmare..."
1,"Linksys has a good reputation, but it didn't work","I purchased this adaptor and the Linksys PC card to set up a peer-to-peer network between a notebook and a desktop. After several days I gave up. I was never able to make the connection. Technical support would only tell me if I had the configuration set up properly, but stopped short of helping make a network connection. Following the suggestion from some of the other reviews I read, I returned the PC card for a Netgear card and tried to make the connection with the Linksys USB adaptor. Still, no success. I ended up returning both Linksys devises and purchased like Netgear hardware. The connection was made almost immediately and I have been happy with the network since."
1,Don't Buy WUSB11 version 2.6,"I received my my wireless USB network adapter, Linksys WUSB11 ver. 2.6, from Amazon.com a week ago and spent many hours to get it working.1. The adapter comes with a USB cable, which has a ""To USB Adapter"" label at one end of the cable. After installed the adapter software, I connected that end to the wireless adapter and the other end to my computer. The adapter's Power LED lighted up, but my computer cannot detect the new device. Before I gave up this defect product, I reversed the cable connection to make my computer to recognize it.2. Encryption WEP with 64 bits does not work. Under this encryption scheme, DHCP gets wrong IP configuration. I had to use either no encryption or 128-bit encryption.3. Software installation is straightforward and easy. The graphical user interface looks nice though. That worths one star.4. I have spent enough time with this Linksys product which should be classified as a defect. I will not buy any Linksys product again."
4,WUSB11 Excellent performance and easy install on WIN7,"The WUSB11 installed easily on Windows 7 and the performance is excellent. Throughput is just about as fast as being directly connected to my cable modem (Earthlink/Time Warner). I use it on a remote desktop machine. The external USB configuration allows me to set the device atop the computer (unlike PCI card versions that obscure the antenna) allowing excellent reception.This unit is a bit long in the tooth for 2010; it only offers WEP (wired equivalent privacy [don't believe it]) security which is a problem. WEP is easily penetrated so if you care about security, I'd recommend you look for a newer device that supports WPA such as the WUSB54G. The newer unit's price is generally comparable. I just ordered my WUSB54G so I can transition my network to WPA; but I'll enjoy the WUSB11 until it arrives."
4,"no problems here, but...","I had to set this up work with one Windows 98 PC via wire, and a Windows XP Laptop, via wireless card.It all worked probably within 20 minutes, and my laptop gets very good reception clear across the house.4 stars though because the manual/setup guide is very sparse and so any problems and you pretty much need to try different things until it all works, or struggle through technical support calls."
3,Wonderful,This is a wonderful tool in connecting all of your computers without having to worry about cords. It is lightweight and with the wall-mount you can put it anywhere you want. I love it!
2,Not ready for XP,"I have 4 computers networked and only the Mac with an airportcard will work with the WAP, very disappointed with the linksysadapters ability to work with the XP operating system. I show nosignal at all to the adapter card, yet the Mac works fine with the WAP. I finally wired two up directly and will probably have to spend more money to purchase a pci card. The instructions wereof no help, the website drivers and filmware didn't work, the phone call to the helpline was a long call without a solution. Iam not down on Linksys their router and WAP are working great, but they can't seem to make XP wireless at least with this adapter. I only hope that the PCI card works. Next time I will read the reviews before I purchase."
5,"Strong, easy to tear, holds well",This does everything that I want gaff tape to do. Best of all it rarely leaves a residue and if it does it's easy enough to use tape to work off.
5,the warriors of cumorah,"Okay guys you are in for a thrill. Chris has done it again! I give it five stars. Chris takes a little girl, gives her some ""magic powers"" and wham you have a novel. The book is not just about a little girl its about surviving in a strange and unknown world I have to admit that it does have a bit of romance, not too much to where the book is mushy gushy or any thing. In the book you are never one one subject for more than one chapter which keeps you on your toes and something is always around the corner ready to jump out and suprise you!"
5,The tradition continues,"Can't go wrong with Heimerdinger. My 9-year old loved it, and having read all the books in the series up to Warriors of Cumorah, is eager to get the next. He got Warriors for Christmas so I'm thinking he'll get the next one on his birthday."
4,"Tough Read, but Enjoyed it.","I read this book because a friend of mine was a ""shirt tail"" relation to the Principal in the book. If you like 1st Person accounts of WW II by the guys/gals who lived it, you'll like this. It's a tough read for a person who isn't a big time reader but it's a fast read. I enjoyed it and thought it was worth the time."
3,Cassette? Really?,"I love everything about this, and use it in school every year. Can't find a machine to play a cassette on anymore. How about an updated version, New Press? Thanks."
4,I give it 4 stars,"Nek is definetly one of Italy's most promising talents. His voice sounds like Sting's, but his music is not jazzy. On the contrary, it's very pop, lots of guitar, and real romantic. I bought the album in italian because I wanted to hear the real thing. If you want to buy this CD you will not be dissapointed. Keep up Nek, we love you."
4,Laid back music with a nice feel to it,"You need to understand that you are not listening to Booker T. & the MGs. No Booker T. Jones, no Steve Cropper on the album. This brings a different feel to the recording but nevertheless a nice one. One track, ""Breezy,"" should have been the title - it sums up the album perfectly. None of the songs made me jump up and take notice (like ""Green Onions,"" ""Hang 'Em High,"" or ""Time Is Tight"") but when the CD is over, I'm still glad I listened to it."
1,Back in the package it goes!,Would definately NOT recommend this product! The clip accessory would not go on. Very awkward fit.
2,$54 per set of replacement fabric blades!,"Do not buy, they look nice hanging in our tiki hut, and work well, but the fabric blades deteriorate quickly, 2 1/2 years old and the loops on the back of the blades are breaking, they cost $54.00 per set from Hunter as per a support email. Hunter has a 1-800 number but I've never been able to speak to a person in 20+ tries, music combined with the insanely annoying woman's voice every 10 seconds is suicide inducing. I'm in que with Hunter right now, current time on phone is 25min. 35 min. 40 min, it's getting difficult now, must hang on. Yea, 43 min and got an answer, unfortunately the blades are not available for purchase, Hunter did offer to send me one new fan that I could take the blades off of for replacements, but I declined since it would only be a short term fix until the other blades broke. Best bet is to steer clear of these."
3,Too hard to install,While it looks cool this fan is extremely heavy and tricky to install so it requires 2 people. My husband and I (who have both successfully installed fans before) both felt that there were serious design flaws that made it unnecessarily difficult to get it onto the ceiling and attached properly. I won't even go into the fact that now that we have it up it doesn't work so we're going to have to take it all down and try to figure out what's wrong (we added a remote so that may be it). That however will have to wait a few weeks until my husband calms down.
2,Not a white bladed ceiling fan,"The ceiling fan came super fast but the blades were not white like I thought they would be. Instead they are a very ivory/ cream color, and they are not cotton like fabric, more like the fabric that is used to make wind breaker jackets. The shipping to send it back was very easy though."
3,Hunter Sanibel Exterior ceiling fan,"Although I like the style of this fan and bought four for our outside porches/lanai's I am very disappointed in the pull chains which after 6 months have seriously corroded. I am going to try to replace the chains with stainless steel jack chain, but feel Hunter should have provided them with more durable metal pull chains for the exterior. I do live right near the ocean, but they are hung in porches which are totally covered and the chain has really corroded terribly.Be ware!"
3,dissapointed,"I give this 3 stars because it does seem to operate well.However....the fabric blades are NOT white and not canvas. They look like old yellowed windbreaker material. Also, It puts out a horrible amount of light. I hired someone to install this fan during the day time and did not go upstairs to look at it until it was dark outside. If I had seen it earlier and the installer had not taken my old fan and the box the Hunter came in....I would have shipped this puppy back ASAP. Now I'm stuck. And bummed."
5,Great lakeside fan,"Well constructed, durable, quiet. Only goes one direction. Takes about 45 min to assemble & hang. I haven't seen this in stores. It is unique in design and works well."
2,Difficult to Install--Poorly Designed Light Kit,"The fan, particularly the light kit, is difficult to install. Now that it is installed (five months ago) the housing holding the globe/shade just fell off of the fan the first hot day of summer. In examining the light kit, it is obvious to me that it is was not designed/built for outdoor use because it does not provide adequate strength and play for expansion/contraction. I am surprised since it is an outdoor fan with a wet rating. Furthermore, good luck with even finding out how to order a replacement globe from Hunter.The fan looks great, but don't count on it lasting or being easy to fix if you have a problem."
4,Really pretty/ broken part twice,"My husband hated putting these up (we ordered two). He says they were the most difficult fans he's ever mounted. One of the fans came with a broken globe, so we called the manufacturer and the immediatly sent a new one. The second one came and didn't fit. So, we are waiting for number three. I really like the aesthetics of the fan. We have them outside on our covered patio."
5,Great product! Great price!,"This product arrived quickly, as described, and at a price nearly $100 less than retail stores. I couldn't be more pleased."
3,Black Chest of drawers,"Came quickly. Easy to put together. But corners are sharp, so be careful where you place it. You wouldn't want anybody getting jabbed as they walk by. Drawers are shallow and lightweight. Drawer pulls are plastic. One is already broken and I've only had it a month or so. But handles can be easily replaced. I'd give it a 3 and a half out of 5 stars if you're looking for a contemporary piece with simple straight lines."
5,Rod McKuen fans,"If one is already a Rod McKuen fan, one does not need any introduction to the kind of productions he creates: music integrated with ""poetry.""I won't pretend that Rod McKuen is a great poet. But he does capture a certain kind of sentiment in a moving sort of way--even if more polished wordsmiths might do it differently.I guess I'd have to say that I frankly found this, my first-time exposure to an entire album of Rod McKuen's work, capable to stirring more than a superficial thought about a number of issues. ""The Art of Catching Trains"" was among the best on the album. The only way to really know whether you like Rod McKuen is to listen to several of the works a couple of times. I'd recommend trying it at least once."
2,Lagioule Steak Knives,"If you are in the market for top of the line Lagioule these are not the knives for you. They are not the serrated edge steak knives that you find. Lagioule makes several TIERS of knives that they put on the market, I thought I had found a good deal. Only to find that the blade was flimsy and the edge was plain (that of a table knife). If you are looking for a steal and don't care much about the quality of the knife, this is a good price. Otherwise I am much happier to just spend $500 dollars on what I am looking for. I will note that I appreciate the 'Wine Enthusiasts' for an easy and hassle-free return, and although I did not check the whole website I am sure that they have quality items in their inventory."
5,Great Introduction to Orthomolecular Medicine,"This is great book for any one interested in learning about orthomolecular medicine and vitamin therapy. Not only is Dr. Andrew Saul very educated and experienced in this area, he also cites other highly educated and experienced doctors and published studies. If you or a loved one are sick, you should buy this book. None of the ""treatments"" suggested in this book are expensive or dangerous. I've already benefited greatly from the vitamin C and Niacin recommendations."
3,mediocre orthomolecular medicine,"I read numerous books on this subject, and I find lots of (o so humorous) suggestions in this book contradicted by other sources. Dr. Saul seems to have a view of orthomolecular medicine that I do not always agree with, also because he presents it as a unbiased view.For instance, research has shown that sublingual b12 (methylcobalamine) is very well absorbed. The results are as good as injections twice a week. Dr. Saul thinks you should crush the tablets, make a paste of it and put it in your nose to absorb.Also it's very incomplete.I would rather recommend books like: Prousky: naturopathic clinical nutritionHoffer & Saul: orthomolecular medicine for everyone.Hoffer & Prousky: naturopathic nutrition."
3,not much is said,"their are a few good points, but its mostly vit. c which linus pauling has already covered. Not much in the way of any new revelations or experiments"
5,Heal thyself,"Good book. I bought a few copies to give as gifts & I'll probably buy a few more. Free yourself from the yoke of ignorance and slavery, which is perpetuated by the pharmaceutical industry via western medicine in the usa and other places.This book can be a good place to start along the path to self education regarding your wellbeing. Don't leave your health care in the hands of people who only make money when you're sick."
5,A valuable resource!!,"I would like to recommend this book highly! My wife and I both work in the ""healthcare"" system. She in hospice, myself in sleep and respiratory care. The current system is a nightmare. I don't know how else to put it! It is going to get much worse, unless the majority of folks take some responsibility for their own health. The value of nutritional therapy has been demonstrated for decades; however, unless the medical system can make a ton of money off of it, they will fight it forever.The current attitude of living self-destructively, then saying to the docs, ""now make me well"", is a total trainwreck."
4,AWESOME LIFECHANGING BOOK!!,This is an amazing book.. well worth the money and has changed my life!! i feel better and am no longer on so many medications.. wish i had seen the movie FOODMATTERS sooner so that i would have heard about this book sooner as well..
4,satisfied,"The book arrived in about five days, I was very satisfied with it. I have no complaints. Service was great and fast."
5,deep pockets!,"I have NEVER found sheets that really fit my very thick mattress, not only do these fit-the are beautiful and very soft. I haven't washed them yet but I am ordering more anyway!"
5,Love Susan,This is the tape I had years ago and it is a great workout. It fits in with any fitness level. Susan has a lot of energy.
4,simple matt,I bought two of these as mats for inside mine and my daughter's tents while camping. Nothing fancy here but for the price I got what I expected. Just a rubber mat with some simple channels to hold any materials or liquid that might drop onto it.
3,Color isn't quite what you think...another shirt another day,"I bought this shirt (in blue) for a friend partially because I thought the color was really nice. When it arrived though, it wasn't quite as bright as it was on my computer screen. Its nothing terribly special, but I was kinda disappointed about the color. My friend loved it, and it looks nice on her."
2,unexpected subject matter.,It's a well made film but the gay subject matter may be offensive to non politically correct viewers. Pass this one up.
1,Bad!,I will never ever get another book reviewed or republished by a library. I didn't even finish! It was that bad!
3,Interesting,"Perhaps the child I ordered it for was a little young (2 1/2), but he was not as interested as I was."
4,Don in Tucson,"This 19"" widescreen monitor works well for me. It was easy to set up, the LCD color is good, and the price was acceptable.The built in speaker is poor, but I use external speakers anyway.So, no complaints at this point."
5,Every song is nice,"So often we buy a CD because one or two of the songs capture us, but then find that we play the CD less and less because other songs on the CD don't appeal to us. This has not been the case with this CD. Every song is pleasant to listen to, and overall the CD is a relaxing dip into the world of folk."
2,HP stinks,"I have had nothing but problems with this tower. Tech support is garbage. After wrestling with the preinstalled OS I finaly blew the drive and installed Windows XP (non media) addition. At present time the PC has no sound the eitheret port that came with the PC does not work. I instaled an after market PCI eithernet card and can at least surf the net. i will never buy another HP tower. I have wasted hours with thier coutomer ""service"". Another company that bases tech support somewhere in asia. Steer clear of HP. Build your own tower or go with Dell or gateway."
4,Adequate for my needs,"This is only my second computer, as it's replacing my 9 year old one. I was happy with Windows 98SE, but so many things won't run on it now. This one had the features I was looking for, and the price was right. There was a lot of unnecessary software preinstalled. I checked some of them out, and one or two won't open, like Snapfish. And I have gotten several ""error""messages, then the program closes. I don't know if that is HP or Windows fault.But it is pretty fast, and I like the easy access ports. I didn't have any trouble hooking up my other hardware or software. I still want to install my other DVD drive though. Hope it's not too difficult. Yes, a floppy would be nice, so would a XP disk."
1,Hp Pavilion a1610n,I bought this computer just before Vista -- didn't get the Vista update...Had problems with it crashing -- I liked the media center --- However after SP3 came out it crashed my computer big time--- HP came out with a fix that has to be put on before downloading.a1610n had an AMD processor and SP3 will mess it up ---My Samsung hard drive is totally destroyed and I will get a new computer without an AMD processor due to SP3
2,Very disappointed and dissatisfied,"I've owned my Pavillion a1610n Media Center edition for about 2 years now, but have only actively used it for about 1 year total. In that time I've had to do a destructive reformat 3 times. Then after installing Windows Service Pack 3 it completely stopped working. Somehow the entire OS on the secondary drive was deleted so I was unable to reformat my hard drive. I paid HP to send me OS disks. The drive would not read the disks. Called HP again, they were suppose to send me new OS disks...it's been almost 2 months and I still haven't gotten them. I'm pretty upset with the whole thing. Now I wonder if I should just buy a new hard drive instead of a whole new system."
1,I fell for the HIPE! (Usually don't....),"Disappointing product. Thought it could perform on tough issues: Shower soap scum , tough dirty grout. This product is for basic easy tasks that I have done with the ole ""elbow grease"". Looks like I will be returning to that method....hehe. Machine is awkward to handle. It does ""shoot out"" LOOSE dirt in hard to reach areas, but that dirt better not be ""tough"" dirt :-)). I do not recommend wasting your money on this. I do not know of any alternative product. Sorry."
1,vapor over steam,I ran into a lady on the Net who tried all the different vapor steamers. She paid a lot less than $500 and she's pretty happy. Maybe this will help you. (...)
2,too bad...........,"What a nice selection of songs! and excerpts from the 3 big piano/orchestral works. And lyrics and verses included! And then the whole thing is ruined because the chord changes are over-simplified, or just wrong. Too bad."
5,Great seat,We got our seat after our son outgrew his infant seat at about 5 months. We love our seat. We heard several people complain about it pinching legs. However if you adjust it the right way it doesn't pinch at all. We would recommend this seat to anyone.
4,Good seat but,"I have this seat for my daughter. In all, its a good seat, make sure its installed correctly, take it down to your local police station. At 1, this seat looked too big for my daughter (22lbs). We had a EB carrier type at that age. At her current 30 lbs, its a perfect fit, and I feel that she's safe.While the longevity of use is nice, safety is more important of course. This carseat is only rated to 40lbs for a 5 pt harness. I offer you this video for you to decide if at 40lbs you want to change to a belt booster: http://youtube.com/watch?v=azgBhZfcqaQ It also offers an alternative seat that IS rated to 80 lbs for harness. Nascar racers use a harness for the safety it provides."
5,Diffrent from U.S. Release,"This release is diffrent from the U.S. release in that the censors here decided to black out the private parts on Ian's painting, with the U.K. version, you get the full unrestricted ""as it were"" painting..."
2,Works but I really can't recommend,"I purchased this player and have used it now for several months. The player & software work but based on my experience I really can't recommend purchasing this unit. My reasons are that 1) the battery life seems very limited and the player stops working usually after about 2-hours of play. I constantly have to change the batteries and the old ones still have life and work fine in my Walkman. 2) the player's software seems to be problematic and will lock-up on many MP3's that play perfectly fine on my computer. Sometimes the player will just stop for no apparent reason. 3) finally, the menus are a little difficult (bass & treble) to operate when exercising and the skip forward and backwards features to not seem to operate effectively."
2,Not for sports use,"This is a good product if you don't plan to use it for running. I have found that it seems to have a very bad battery connection and will 'cut out' while I'm running. What makes that especially annoying is that then the unit has to go through the 'power-up' process all over again (takes 15-20 seconds) and you're back at the first song. Of course you can fast forward to the song you were listening to, but this seems to create even more strain on the battery and sometimes the unit cuts out again. I find that the unit only operates properly during the first 1-2 hours on a new battery. From there on out, even though it might say that you have 5 hours left on your battery, you will have problems.If it weren't for this problem it would be a good unit!"
2,Poor Quality Player and Bad Customer Support,"I purchased the player as a gift needless to say after about a month of use the machine stopped working. MP3's would play for a short while and just freeze the machine. The switch would not power down the machine and I would have to remove the batteries in order to reset it.I have had nothing but several weeks of emails with customer support and have finally received a replacement. Only trouble is this replacement does not work at all. It does not even switch on.For those of you who may doubt the bad reviews here, I suggest you also look at ...the Better Business Bureau for some insightful customer frustrations"
4,Good player but does have some problems,"Overall I think this Rio 600 is worth the money. It is reliable, holds a lot of music, sounds great and doesn't skip. I primarily use it for working-out and running. I do like it because it's small enough to wear comfortably so I take it pretty much everywhere. However the headphones are not that great so I bought some Sony sport water resistant ones that sound much better. I also have the problem where it sometimes either won't turn on or it does but freezes and the only way to fix it is to take the battery off and reconnect it. That is a minor inconvienience but I also would rather not have to do it. But as I said, I DO feel is is worth the money and you will enjoy your favorite downloadable songs."
1,player worked for about a year,"I had the rio 600 for under a year. I found that it constantlyfreezes up when running. For a product that claims not ""skip""I found this to be much worse since the backpack would have tobe removed to unfreeze it (on/off switch frozen also). WOULDNOT RECOMMEND THIS PLAYER. Its in the trash now."
4,Rio 600 64 MB Works Great with Audible,"...I had previously had the Rio 300. This is a very nice product and works well with the audible.com audio. I actually look forward to my 1 hour commute thanks to both of these. The battery life is great, downloading material is fast. I highly recommend... the rio 600 64 MB..."
3,I really like this player but...,"The Rio 600 is a very capable player but the included headphones and software bite. I use ""Music Match Jukebox"" as the software for the Rio 600. With MMJB you can use leveling and even apply DFX effects to the tracks before you download them to the player. Like any audio equipment the quality of the output depends heavily on speaker quality. I listen to the Rio through a pair of Sony MDR-V600s and the sound Kicks."
1,Nothing but problems,"This is the second 600 I have had, and now this one is kaput and I'm shopping for a new one, I don't want to deal with it anymore. LIke many others said, it won't turn on and you have to take the backpack off, my backlight works very randomly, when you turn the volume up or down it freezes and you have to disconnect the backpack, now it won't even play, you push play and it just restarts the device! Two thumbs down!"
1,POOR QUALITY,I normally don't feel the need to blast any company but I've had (and returned) 3 of the Rio products. I had the 800 - worked for 10 minutes. I tried a demo model of the 600 32mb - never turned on. And now I'ved tried the 600 64mb - the unit turns on but doesn't play. The play button functions like the skip button. This company has a BIG QUALITY PROBLEM and their site is almost useless. Avoid Avoid Avoid.
4,Good to take running,"This MP3 player is pretty easy to use and easy to set up. You don't have to be a computer nerd to use it. The design is stylish, and it comes with a belt clip.I've found this MP3 player is quite nice to have while running or exercising. Unlike CD players, it will not skip - so you don't have to hold the thing like a goon the whole time you're running.The downside is the memory. 64 meg. can only hold so many songs, and of course, the higher the quality the more memory each song takes up. It can hold somewhere between a half hour and an hour's worth of songs. This isn't a problem if you're using it to take with you while you're jogging, but it's not the sort of thing you want on a 5 hour plane ride.Erasing and adding tracks to the MP3 player doesn't take too long (maybe 10 minutes), but it is a pain if you change the playlist everytime you want to go to the gym.All in all, this is a neat toy. I'm pretty happy with it."
2,Not a solid product,"I purchased by Rio600 after my Rio500 inexplicably quit working altogether. I would have used another brand, but I primarily use the MP3 player to listen to books from audible.com and there are a limited number of compatible brands. The Rio600 seems really flimsy, the buttons don't work consistently and the battery gage shows full and then jumps to empty within 2 minutes. In addition, the unit emits noise through the output that makes it very difficult for me to use with my SoundFeeder (which is a device that broadcasts the output onto FM radio, so that I can listen in my car without having a cassette input). I would avoid SONICBlue products if possible."
2,It is not worth buying don't waist your time.,It looks cool but it's not. It does not hold enough music for me.It was a waist of my time. I would not recommend this product to anyone. So if you are looking for a Mp3 player this is not the one. Keep searching.
1,"If you like shoddy craftsmanship, then purchase this player","I bought my Rio 600 online at Tigerdirect (I've had great experiences with them) and I have regretted it since the end of the first 3 months of ownership.I bought the 32MB version with the extra 32MB backpack upgrade... it worked for about three months, and then it simply stopped working. It would not turn on, or display anything on the screen. After several e-mails to rio's customer support, I finally convinced them that my player really was broken, and that it was not a firmware problem. They finally sent me a replacement, which lasted about three months and is now broken again, exact same problem. I will not buy an mp3 player or anything else from Rio or its affiliates. I got this as a deal for about $70; at least that's all I paid. You get what you pay for, so save up for an iPod."
4,it's pretty good,"for the reviewer who wrote ""This is an excellent player! (if your one of the lucky 10% who actually gets one that works). Even if your one of the lucky 10%, I'll give you three months before it dies on you..That's what mine did."" - I wouldn't trust this grammatically incorrect review. I've had my mp3 player for over a year and it works perfectly fine. And if I, along with all the others who have reviewed the product, got it to work for much longer than 3 months, obviously it was the user's use of the product that caused its downfall.The only complaint I have about the product is that the battery indicator is inaccurate. It will be at 60% and then a second later, will just be dead. So be sure to have an extra battery with you when you get under 75%.I am not sure about the validity of the mp3 draining the battery even when it's off, but I find my battery lasts pretty long even if it's been off for awhile"
3,Not enough memory!,"If you need an mp3 player and have a small budget this product is great for you. Hovewer I have some complaints: My main complaint is its low memory. I expected 2 hours(written on the box), but I only got a little over an hour. The battery is also a problem. This device eats up batteries. It's supposed to last around 11 hours but only lasts around 5. The headphones [stink]! But most headphones which come with devices aren't that great eather. It's small size and light weight is great. It also has some nifty features."
2,"Nice, but not worth it","the rio 600 is a sharp player. the sound qualty is great, the features are great. but it isn't worth it unless you have a small collection of audio. it just can't hold that much. 64 mb can hold max 25 good length mp3's. and if you want to upgrade sonic blue is the only palce to buy new memory. instead of removable memory cards, they sell backpacks specially for the rio, and the biggest memory card they sell is 128 mb. the controls are also very difficult to work. they are small and you tend to hit the wrong button. if you are looking for a small mp3 player with good sound, it is nice but i don't think it is worth it."
4,battery hog,"this player is really nice, it has a cool look, good design and awesome lcd. The EQ is one of my favorite fucntions, and the playlist editing is a must for all mp3 players. Everything is nice with it, except that it EATS BATTERIES LIKE IT IS DRACULA SUCKING OUT THE BATTERY JUICE AS IT PLAYS. ITS LIKE A HUNGRY HOG THAT INHALES ITS FOOD, ONLY ITS A BATTERY HOG AND INHALES THE BATTERIES. It says it has 6 hours of battery life left, and it all of a sudden says it has 2 minutes left and i have to replace batteries. I have had this for a month and i have used about 16 batteries already, its gone from lasting for 20 minutes(3 times) to 11 hours, but 11 hours only once or twice. On average, about 4-5 hours is what you will get from 1 battery. If this was a 2 battery unit, i wouldnt touch this, but one battery will do. Once or twice the power has shut off at a random time, but otherwise, this was a great deal."
2,The bare minimum,"I got the RIO for Christmas, while I was really hoping for a Techno Yepp. The RIO works. That's about it, though. The firmware is poorly designed. You have to go through four steps, just to see what time it is. The interface (buttons) are also poor; they feel cheap and are hard to use through the soft clip-on case. Finally, it looks like there's a lot of wasted space in the design. The player could be a little smaller, packed tighter, and feel a little less cheap.That being said, I haven't had any technical problems with my RIO. By tweaking the frequency of the playback, you can squeeze three hours of good quality music on 64 megs. That being said, I would jump at the opportunity to use something with software that was more intuitive."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,I received this MP3 player for x-mas and from the start it had problems. First it would shut down uneeplainable and more recently the battery life has decreased to a pathetic level. I am at Amazon right now to buy an Intel MP3 player.... Do yourself a favor and dont buy the Rio
3,"Have an expert computer person by your side, you'll need it","We purchased the Rio 600, and after more than 8 hours of trying to process and install all the programing info, it's been fun and easy. The initial time to program was a HEADACHE, and I'm not sure if I would atempt the process again. It's very easy to install CD's, but we are still working on downloading from MP3.com for music.Might want an advanced computer person by your side to do the initial installing of the program info. It's tough!!!"
1,"looks like 5 stars, performs like 1","This is an excellent player! (if your one of the lucky 10% who actually gets one that works). Even if your one of the lucky 10%, I'll give you three months before it dies on you..That's what mine did. Waste of money,Waste of time unpackaging it. Amazing how such a crappy product can come in such a good quality package."
2,Don't!,"My Rio 600 power switch fell out! The case isso poorly designed that squeezing it in my hand causes the topseam to open. Mine was in my backpack and must have gottensqueezed so the switch fell out. So either I send it back(and take my chances of getting who knows what in return) oruse a toothpick to turn it on and off.Otherwise (!), it's a good MP3 player."
1,"Poor Design, Awkward interface.","The RIO 500 was excellent. When in ceased working I sent it to the folks for repair. SEVERAL MONTHS LATER!!! I gave up and asked for a replacement. The Rio 600 came shortly.The memory is non-standard. If you want more, Rio is the only place.The battery compartment is difficult to get to.The interface could be better.Hmmm On the plus sideIt is Audible Ready. It has (as far as I can tell) unlimited bookmarks."
3,Great beginning player,"I started learning all about .mp3's a couple months ago(Thanks Napster). I immediately got a writable cd burner and then moved onto pc based .mp3 player and just learned how to convert .mp3 files into Windows Media Player(cut's the filesize in half!!!) So my obvious next choice was to buy a portable .mp3 player. I didn't know anything about them so I decided to buy the basic unit before I wanted to drop $300 on one of the really good ones. The guy at BestBuy recommended the Rio600 because it's pretty basic, yet upgradable firmware and memory pack (up to 340mb pack). So far I'm really happy with it and recommend it if you're looking for you're first mp3 player.Last, back to mp3-to wma conversion.. I could only load 6 6mb .mp3's into the Rio600 w/32mb. I converted my .mp3's to .wma (Microsoft Windows Media Player format) and I was able to load those 6 files + 5 more! Convert your files to WMA! You WON'T regret it!"
1,Don't buy it,"I've now gone through two of these devices. I experienced the same problems others have described on both units. Specifically, the battery does not hold its charge even when it is not being used. Also, the unit does not always turn on even when it is charged. What's even worse is customer service. I sent them an email and they respond by directing me to send my email to another site. Why didn't they just forward it themselves? Either way, they never responded. Bottom line...the unit doesn't deliver what it promises and customer support is non-existent."
1,Poor Quality Control,"I am the IT manager for a large company so I am fairly technically adept. I received a RIO 600 MP3 player for Father's Day this year. I installed the software, which was not user friendly at all. I then installed the battery and noticed how paper-thin the plastic parts of the player were. When I plugged the player into the USB cable to download songs, there was a loud ""pop"" and smoke came out of it. I returned it to the store and bought a Creative Labs Nomad II C and love it. It is built well, the software is very easy to use, the controls are intuitive. The Nomad is a great little machine."
5,Still around?,"This was my first MP3 player. Worked well for the time I had it, and it was top of the line when I bought it. I thought it was a quality product for the price."
2,Takes 3 pictures,"Fun, FUN book, EXCEPT... there are two places to put a picture, the front cover and the back cover. Because the front cover has a hole for the face of the picture and the other side of the front cover takes a full size body picture, it takes THREE pictures to use this book.Otherwise I loved this book! I like it for the age of at least 2 or older, because the dresses in this book are drawn as if the child is not a baby, but perhaps a toddlar to young child age. CUTE!"
2,Item is named incorrectly,"A Dish 1000 PLUS looks at orbital locations 110, 119, and 118.7. This image is NOT of a Dish 1000 PLUS, neither is the description of a Dish 1000 PLUS. But the title reads ""Dish 1000+"". Just a heads up. I would call this dish a straight Dish 1000. Not a 1000.2 or a 1000.4 mind you. If they took off the ""+"" from the title, all would be well."
4,Top rate voice - mediocre material,"Signing Mable John to Stax records from Motown ought to have given Stax producers some sort of an idea about the direction that she needed to go to have massive hits.Unfortunately, as these tracks amply prove, they never got to grips with giving her the right material to fulfil her potential.By far and away the best track is ""Stay out of the kitchen"". ""That's what my love can do"" is passable, but apart from those, producers and writers seem to have struggled to move her away from a series of 'little girl done wrong' tracks.Her voice is never less than good,sometimes excellent, but with Shirley Brown and Jean Knight seemingly getting the best of what house writers had to offer, it's little wonder that she decided going back on the road with Ray Charles was a more productive line of work. The version of ""Need your love so bad"" is a poignant reminder of the heritage of her brother"
3,"Nice, too bad it didn't fit","The quality is great and the brand is one that I have purchased before. The problem is that there are no options here to select year or model of vehicle. ""Chevrolet Truck"" covers a lot of different sizes and shapes. When I received the box, it says ""Pickup (metal dash)"". Knowing that information may help you decide if this will fit your truck. It didn't fit mine, so I had to send it back."
5,Good product,I bought them as a gift for my husband and he really likes them. They are a little stiff and need to be broken in but other than that they are nice.
4,Gorgeous Loafers,The color and wash of these are so much nicer looking than regular brown loafers you'd find somewhere else.The person I bought them for needed to exchange them for half a size down than his usual.
4,Good Shoe,"This is a good shoe, but not an excellent one. I purchased it 3 months ago and it's holding well. It's very comfortable."
2,Wears out too fast.,"Bought these shoes because I liked the look and needed a new pair of ""driving"" shoes after my last pair wore out after about 2 years of use. I've had these for about 3 months and they are already falling apart. The rubber on the sole is falling apart, and the leather at the toe is peeling off. I would not recommend these as everyday business casual shoes."
1,Fake Steve Maddens from China,"I have 2 of the exact same pairs of shoes purchased from Macy's and the pair that I received from Amazon were not only missing insoles and the Steve Madden name anywhere on the shoes, but were fake plastic replicas from China. Completely unacceptable and now have to go through the pain of returning them."
1,Garbage shoe,"I have had these shoes for less than three months, and I only have worn them about 20 times in very light wear (to the store, around the house and such). Both shoes are already losing their seams and falling apart. The covering on the leather was so thin it is showing through, and looks like they are three years old, not three months. My wife had ordered these before we read the other reviews, but we decided to give them a try anyway. I wish we hadn't. What a hassle! We are having to return them, and I would never buy another shoe from this maker again. They are garbage. I would have been better off buying some shoe at my local dollar store."
2,"Looks great, but doesnt last long","Bought a pair of these about 5 months ago. Actually bought two; one brown, one black. I wear the brown a lot more and they go with everything, but after about 2 months the bottoms wear out and fall apart. The bottoms now have holes in them. They shoes were great for a while, now they are going in the trash and will be buying from a different brand."
2,non lasting shoe,"The shoe is very handsome. I can tell a lot went into the design except for doing it's job, i.e. protecting your feet. The shoe has no support and after a few months of normal wear a hole developed in my left toe on the outer leather. Not much longer did the irreplaceable thin leather foot-bed wear down to the rubber sole. If your intention is for the ""sole"" purpose of taking the Maserati out for a spin, then the shoe fits. If you plan on throwing the frisby around to impress the ladies with you mad skills, I suggest you do it barefooted."
1,Bad Buy!,Very bad quality. The thread on side of shoe started tearing off on 1st day. Returned it immediately. Highly discourage any potential buyers.
2,Leather really rough,Normally 8 or 8.5 fits my feet. But the leather of this shoes is too rough. I first ordered 8.5 and I return it to replace by 9. Even the size 9 is like a blade in my feet. When walking I feel scratching my feet but it looks very good. Make sure you order one bigger that your size.
5,Great shoes,The shoes are very sleek and comfortable. I wore them during a date night with my wife and it completed the look. I'd recommend these shoes to all Steve Madden fans!
2,Spend the extra money for a shoe that last longer,"Great looking shoe, but the material at the tip of the shoe is synthetic and the sole is stitched to it. The walking motion of the sole directly contacts the tip and rubs a hole straight through it, exposing the end of your foot. I cant believe these are still on the market. Huge disappointment. Spend the money for something of higher quality because these are extremely cheap made. Not worth $25 in my mind. Madden lost a customer for life here!"
2,Don't get them wet!,"These are certainly handsome shoes though there are all kinds of construction issues. Also, don't get them wet or wear them in winter weather or you will be throwing them out within a week, guarantee. I'm not sure what they're made out of, but they end up smelling unholy terrible afterwards. If none of this is enough of a deterrent, I would wear wear these shoes seldom and in dry, warm weather."
1,poor craftsmanship,the stitching at the top of the shoe came apart the first time worn. didn't wear until summer so the return period expired. very disappointed.
1,Stitching coming off after four months,"I generally like the shoe. It looks good and is comfortable. However, it is poorly made. The stitching is coming off after four months."
5,Loafers,These shoes are so nice! Exactly as described! I bought these as a birthday present for my dad. I was very excited when I found these shoes so cheap!
5,Comfortable and stylish,"Shoe is high quality, well made and very comfortable- I wear it everyday. Received many compliments from others. Highly recommended."
4,Fun on the run,"The PSP is one of the best systems for the gamer on the go, and sports titles that you can easily pick up and put down are, in my opinion, a good time. Hot Shots was one of the first titles to come out for the PSP, and while it's age is showing and Tiger Woods golf is more in depth, Hot Shots is great if you just like a simple, yet fun, game of golf."
3,if your a man don't buy unless its for kids.,"I was interested in psp a golf game being a gamer in all. I started playing it and wow its shockingly way to childish for adults. I really don't give a hoot about unlocking new items like glasses,hair and jewelry. I wanted to play a consistent fun golf game,but It was more of a fashion show at toys r us. The game play was decent at times and other times just plain annoying with hard to read breaks on the green, winds awful to judge and worst of all you have to play the same course over and over and over. I feel kids would have a terrible time learning the ins and outs. You eventually get decent unlockable clubs and balls but id rather just play a adult game like tiger woods ect."
4,"Works great, expensive to install","I put this water heater into my guest house, where I generally have 2-6 people most weekends, to replace a traditional 40-gallon tank. It's working great. My only warning to potential buyers is that it cost me $750 to have it installed."
1,Unit is unreliable. Customer support is terrible.,"Have had ongoing problems with Bosch tankless. Replaced several parts at a cost totaling over half the original unit's cost, but still functions unreliably. Customer support is terrible - over 40 minute wait for service, representatives are rude and poorly trained. Highly recommend looking at one of the other manufacturers of tankless water heaters!"
1,bad customer service,"the unit itself failed within first 2 weeks, it was installed last Nov. and i am still trying to solve the heater problem, called tech supports, they don't take the responsbility, and make up all kind of reasons accuse it is owner's fault for wrong installations.i am want to solve this water heater problems and call them, but they don't even return my calls.this is ridiculous that such a big company has this bad service.people who are considering buying tankless water heater, watch out for their services. they don't cover labor, and 10-15% of parts."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS WATER HEATER,"If you live in a place that experiences temperatures below 32 degrees, DO NOT BUY THIS hot water heater. They will freeze and the company will not stand behind their product. [...]"
3,Tarantinoesque fun,"I have not seen the blu-ray version but the movie is fun. If you enjoy Tarantino's and Rodriguez's films, you will probably enjoy this. I would love to see a sequel with a higher budget."
2,Too Little Light,"This is about the 5th book light I have bought. Others were either not bright enough, bulky, or broke after limited use. When I first used this light it was bright and fully illuminated both pages of a paperback book. That quickly changed and now I have to constantly move it over the pages in order to get enough light. If the battery life were better I would give it a strong recommendation as a travel light. As is, the two CR2450 batteries cost somewhere around $1 each so I would only consider this a backup device. Since I use it a lot at home rather then travel I also prefer an ac adapter to save on battery costs and to insure consistent output."
1,NINE MISSING PIECES,"What do you rate a puzzle that has NINE missing pieces. My son got one as a present, and the three puzzles are designed to go together, so we ordered the other two from Toy Master. When we told the Toy Master people about the missing pieces, they kept telling us to contact the manufacturer, which we did, but got no response until a week after we had mailed them back to Toy Master. We got a full refund, but we are still out the $11.57 it cost us to ship them back. Not the excellent experience I usually have with Amazon."
5,Masterful and incredibly original,"This album is primarily comprised of highly original works for an unaccompanied bass. I was at first a bit skeptical about how a solo bass could carry an audience for an entire album, but I am no longer. The pieces are best described as ""other-worldly"" beautiful. The artist melds Jazz with New-age to create a soundscape that reminds me a lot of what Brian Eno, a pioneer in electronic music, was trying to accomplish. But, unlike Eno who had banks of synthesizers to work with, Moore does this with a single Bass! Masterful and incredibly original."
3,"Good taste, annoying packaging--3.5*","I'm torn between a 3 & a 4 star. The taste is good--without the overpowering saltiness of some soups. But, the silly blue lid is just too difficult to get off. I did manage not to spill any soup--you need to be careful as the cup is quite full. The noodles are wheat so not great for gluten allergies. It also contains MSG which I'd prefer to avoid. I did like the size--many microwave soups are quite small. Yes, it's a bit more expensive, but it's Progresso. It has a nice amount of chicken too but not very heavy on vitamins (except A). I think your satisfaction with this product depends on how you weigh taste vs. packaging."
3,"Watery soup, poor packaging, bad value for money","This chicken and noodle soup is much worse than Campbells. Progresso's is watery, with tiny pieces of chicken. I was very dissapointed. Packaging is poorly designed, soup spills all over. Taste was mediocre. Price paid too high! Not impressed, better buy regular cans of soup and take them to work in regular plastic containers."
2,dried cherries,I was disappointed because these cherries are so dry there are tough. I buy a mixture from qvc that is so moist therefore I am disappointed in these cherries/
1,This book is AWFUL,"This book is utterly AWFUL when it comes to comparing it with other academic histories. I would not recommend it to anyone, except as one of the worst histories written, EVER."
4,This would be way better if Shane addictions didn't get in the way,"When you hear all Pogues albums in a row you can tell something is happening to Shane Macgowan. On ""Red Roses For Me"" he sounds sharp intense and clear. When you get all of the way to ""Hell's Ditch"" he sounds muttled confused worn out and his voice has more of a gutteral sound. What's so bad you can hear it progressively get worse in each album and it starts getting very noticeable on the ""Peace and Love"" CD. This is a better album than ""Peace and Love"" but the vocals are harder to listen to. It is sad all of that talent got stifled by his addictions, I guess this is selfish since if he wasn't so talented I wouldn't care."
1,Sonicare not helpful in product support,"It is extremely difficult if not impossible to determine what brush heads to order for your Sonicare toothbrush. The official Sonicare site isn't much help; they don't even have very good pictures of their products. I ordered these brush heads, but who knows if they will work. Also, the Sonicare toothbrush that my son uses has a faulty seal where the brush head meets the base, so that gunk builds up in the crevices inside. Looks like the same gunk that happens on the special brush head holder."
2,Will this fit my brush?,"The rating for the over all sonicare brush I would give is a 5, but why make it so hard to match replacement heads to the unit you have? My brush says: ""PHILIPS Sonicare"" and then, etched into the bottom, ""061009 HX9500"". With Philips changing their models every year, you would think that Philips, or even amazon would list all compatable models with their replacement heads, but they don't. Why? Do they hope we'll give up and buy a whole new unit? So who does list this info? The only people who really care about selling small amounts of items at a time:eBay sellers!Doesn't matter what you're looking for, Google your model number, what you're trying to replace, with ""ebay"", and then click on the first eBay link on the list."
3,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"AFTER READING ""CLAY"" I WAITED EXPECTANTLY FOR THIS BOOK. UNFORTUNATELY IT HAS A HUNKY HERO, A SPUNKY LIKEABLE FEMALE LEADAND A VERY POOR PLOT/STORY LINE. THE 3 LITTLE KIDS AND CUTE DIALOGUE WAS DELIGHTFUL BUT THIS WAS JUST AN OLD ""HARLEQUIN"" TYPEREAD."
1,"Unexpected, seeing it's Progresso","I ordered more than one case of the Progresso Italian Wedding Soup. Silly, I know . . . but I was buying ""Progresso"", and the illustration implied a nicely chunky product -- full of pasta, meatballs, spinach and other veggies in a flavorful broth. Unfortunately, that turned out to not be the case. The soup was watery. Watery! And bland! And worst of all, the microwave cup contained that looked like what I would expect from one of those anonymous generic soups you can spot in a Wannabe WallyWorld discount grocery store, not in a container from a brand touting itself as so much richer/better than Campbell's, et al. Now, I gotta figure out a way to liven up those two cases of tasteless, very sparsely populated ""Italian Wedding Soup"". Maybe I'll throw in some ""good ole"" mild Sam's Club Salsa. Yeah, that's the ticket. Definitely won't buy another can of Progresso Italian Wedding Soup, much less a case of the stuff."
1,"""My man Benhated wanna holla at you""","After seeing this CD in the radio station I occasionally DJ at each week I saw this CD and burst into laughter. I thought his name was PRECIOUS! I then put the CD in my pocket and walked out with it and played it in my car. The first minute of the song is so intelligent. I mean it perfectly portrays the way it must feel sometimes to be a young female growing up in the urban society of today. She clearly has a hard time and tells them (in a way) ""Leave me alone"". This is priceless! The actual song is lame and unoriginal. I'd rather hear ""Animal Boy"" by this lame band on mp3.com than this song. Heck, I'd rather see a Jamaican reggae, goth, country-emo band named ""SkazzlyMutilatinPooPoos"" than this song."

1,"Review of ""Cottonwood Summer""","I ordered this book, ""Cottonwood Summer,"" upon the recommendation of my sister who claimed that it contained descriptions of growing up in a small town much like the one in which we grew up. After receiving the book and reading the first two chapters, I lost interest immediately. The author's description of life in a small town is boring, unexciting and long-winded. I have decided to read just a few chapters at a time in hopes that the story becomes more interesting ""down the road."" But at this point, I would have to say that I have never been more underwhelmed in my life.Cottonwood Summer"
3,good but not good enough,"This book is really about the author's view of how mathematicians think and live in the current day. There are oodles of little tidbits of ""weird mathematicians"". You get some idea of what the RH is about, but it's not _really_ the point of the book. Unfortunately, the focus on De Branges overcorrects the math establishment's treatment of him, which, though unfortunate, is partly justified (he announced yet another proof today or yesterday - which may be correct this time). Not recommended overall, but definitely gives a slice of life from the sciences that acknowledges both human failings and sublime thoughts."
5,Crisp introduction for the layman,"Before I comment on the content of the book I just want to say that the design of the jacket is simply brilliant! The book itself is very entertaining, captivating, and interesting. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the Riemann Hypothesis. It not only gives you some of the key ideas that are out there in the mathematics community for attacking the problem but it also gives you an account of the major players in this field. It tells you why mathematicians love working on problems against all odds. The book relates their excitement, frustrations, creativity, dedication, and mental stamina in a way that it feels as if it's you instead of Sabbagh who is interviewing the mathematicians. Simply put, it's a fun book!!"
1,Buy Prime Obsession Instead!!,"In this tome about one of the most celebrated conjectures in Mathematics today, there are actually more words attributed to some person not fathoming why the multiplication of two negative numbers yields a positive number than there are to Andrew Wiles and Fermat's Last Theorem. The author spends far too much time on basic concepts while ignoring the major aspects of the Riemann Hypothesis theory. If I wanted basic concepts, I would have read other books. Consequently, this book turns out to be a real disappointment. I returned my copy back to Amazon and instead ordered Prime Obsession. You will learn a lot more from Prime Obsession!"
1,Forget it !!,"This book is only for those with no math background who have an interest in the Riemann Hypothesis. I would imagine this to be a small group. Unfortunately, those from this group will be in a nearly similar state after having read the book."
2,Where's the Beef?,Nice to have a book to read on the mathematical history and personalities hooked on the search. Way too soft on what the search is for and actual progress in any direction. Has an appendix with some current effort at a proof but without any surrounding discussion it's hardly worth the effort.
2,"Approachable, but Lost my Trust","As a math hobbyist, I've been very eager to learn more about the Riemann Hypothesis. I ordered this book a couple weks ago, and fell ill this week -- so I had some time to spend reading.I didn't get very far before I found a rather glaring error. On page eighteen, the author explains one method for showing that there's no largest prime number. He asserts that:(2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 + 1) / 7is equal to2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 + (1/7)which is not correct. The left-hand term actually evaluates to2 * 3 * 5 * 11 * 13 * 17 + (1/7).Maybe I'll revise my review after I read more; perhaps the book really does deserve my trust. But after an early blunder like this in a simple topic, maybe I won't read any further.Less astute readers might not have caught this and later become confused. Maybe, in the deeper topics, I won't be able to proof the text and become confused or disillusioned by other errors."
1,junk,this is junk not as pictured crappy design do not buy!! stamped crap bent on me within a few hundred miles! welds cracked! absolute junk!
5,great lamp,"very happy with the appearance, the ease at which it was put together, and the amount of light it gives off. perfect addition to the livingroom."
3,"Electronic Curling Iron, 3/4 Inch Barrel",This does just fine not real fancy gets the job done as they say Really like the ceramic ones better just a personal preference
3,"Appealing, but small","This is basically a winter hat that extends to cover the ears.It's tight on me, so I won't wear it, but someone with a 6 1/2'' head would be able to fit into it."
4,A story of true troll love,"A great story about true love. Is true love a good dowry, or caring about someone? Typically great illustration from Tomie De Paola."
4,Dottie Rambo-What a lady!,"I just recently purchased the Legacy of Buck and Dottie Rambo at a Dottie concert. She stated that Buck Rambo wrote this book own his own without any input from her. I can believe it. Anyone that has ever heard Ms. Dottie sing, knows that the Spirit of God just flows from her in every song. Whether it be one that she wrote or just one that sings from another writer. He gives her some credit but not enough. A person can only believe that it is through her belief and faith in God that keeps her going through all of her health problems. Anytime you need an uplifting experience just read the book and pay attention to Dottie's unending never wavering faith in GOD."
3,Well this IS the most psychedelic trade...,"...and it remained my least favorite one, neck to neck with Kissing mr. Quimper story. It is , basically, telepathic interogation of battered and bruised King Mob and Invisibles to the rescue. Since I didn't like it so much, well, get it only if you wanna see it through the end."
3,A Bit Dated,"Don't let the 1990 date fool you; this book was originally published in 1963, and the 1990 reprint made only minor updates to two pages of supply source listings. While the basic concepts in the book are pretty much timeless (book stitching, basic cover creation, etc.), the ""creative"" portion of the book -- suggested artwork techniques for book covers -- is distinctly '60s. This covers about 1/3rd of the book's contents. If you are interested in the ""creativity"" side of book cover art, I would suggest looking for a newer book on bookbinding. Better yet, leave the cover plain, buy Print Shop, and whip up a dust jacket for the artwork ;-)"

4,A very interesting read,"This was the first Hemingway novel I ever read. Like one of the other reviewers, I don't pretend to understand and analyze all of Hemingway's symbolism, but with the help of Cliffs Notes and SparkNotes (online at www.sparknotes.com), I discovered how masterful Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms is. This is not difficult reading, but it is beautifully worded and the descriptions of places and events are spellbinding. This is one of the better high school required books I have read. If anyone wants to get into the classics, A Farewell to Arms is a good place to start."
3,"Confusing, but interesting.","Though Ernest Hemingway does a fine job of coordinating events for the reader, it is difficult to follow the conversations between characters. At time surreal, some of the conversations plasticize the character, and some are just completely incomprehensible. Did people really ever talk that way to each other? I found the book mediocre for the most part, and I was able to follow along and keep up with the story, but couldn't get too excited about it. The ending, however, almost managed to pull the entire story together. It was a fabulous ending, not predictable at all until the last chapter or so. ""Tenente's"" ability to deal with everything so casually does seem a bit fantastic, but the ending saves this character from a life of dullness. Overall, the book did not leave me wanting to read any more of Mr. Hemingway's work. I would only recommend it during a reading slump, or when there is nothing else available."
5,Farewell to Arms,"I like Hemingway because his stories are realistic. Life doesn't have many happy endings, but it has moments of great passion, romance and happiness along the way. This book is kind of like that. His short sentences and terse writing style cut right to the core of your emotions and help you feel all this book has to offer. A brilliant place to start your appreciation of one of histories greatest writers.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
2,You're kidding right?,"I am a high school student, and I just read ""A Farewell To Arms"" for my Honors English class. When I first heard about Hemingway, I thought he was supposed to be great. This book was very boring and slow. I thought the characters could have been better. The ending was tragic at the end. Plus, the end leaves you hanging and doesn't tell you what happens to Frederick. The two stars I gave him was because, it was a novel and I could never write one. I was very disappointed"
1,well then,"SPOILER ALERT: you tell me i'm gonna read a story about a drunk american soldier (who for some reason fights w/ the italian army) who shoots a guy in the back, knocks up a british nurse, who goes AWOL and ends up losing his preg girl AND the kid - and 99 out of 100 people will say ""no thanks"". tell them its hemingway, all of a sudden it's a ""classic"". EXACTLY what happened to me - this was terrible, and you know what, some times 80 year old works that were great when written just don't hold up, put this one in that category. pass."
2,"Did I hear someone say ... ""Run-on sentences"" ???","I bought this book because I read somewhere that it's considered a ""great American novel"". While I haven't completed it ... I have to say I'm a bit indifferent about it. It's OK. So, I'd give it the label ""OK American novel"". My review is greatly influenced by Hemingway's annoying use of paragraph-long, run-on sentences. In many cases, they don't even make sense. By the time a get to the end of these sentences, I've lost track of what he's talking about. It almost made me give up on the book during the first chapter."
1,Why are the famous ones always bad?,"Hemingway is supposed to be one of the greatest authors of the 21st century, right? I read A Farewell to Arms this summer, and I thought it had to be one of the worst books I've ever read, and that's saying quite a bit. His brief descriptions and simple dialogue bored me. And his description of love! It wasn't love, it was sex. Clearly written from an immoral man's perspective, it was impossible for me to relate to the characters. And the ending, well, it was just stupid. There was no lesson to be learned, no happy ending, nothing that makes a great book great. The entire focus of the book was one man's unrelenting self-pity that eventually cost him everything he held dear."
1,Wow - that was bad,"I heard Hemingway is great so I read this book. In reality what I found out was that Hemingway was depressed. This book is nothing more than the tale of an alcoholic who's disease leads himself and others to destruction. The only amazing fact is that the war doesn't't get him first. In reality, it seemed the war had little affect on him. It was his own selfishness that did him in."
1,Yuck!,"Hemingway should have stuck to journalism. his novels read like depressing grocery lists. Why did the chicken cross the road? According to Hemingway ""To die. In the rain."" Yuck!"
3,"An interesting story, but poorly written","A Farewell to Arms is the story of an affair between an American enlisted as an ambulance driver in the Italian Army and a British military nurse during World War I. This book has an interesting story line, and charachters you can't help but like. Unfortunately, however, this book is just not very well written. It is extremely choppy, and even contains blatant gramatical mistakes, Hemingway apparently never learned about subject-verb agreement. This book is very interesting, but would be much more enjoyable if it was written more smoothly."
3,Boring!,"Boring, boring. The heroine was a card board cutout, no real persoanlity and impossible to connect with. The book does convey the horror and utter pointlessness of war though!"
3,Not what I expected.....,"Hemingway's book is not what I expected. I didn't like his writing style, I didn't develop a strong attachment to the characters, his book definitely lacked fluency, and there was only a modicum of interpersonal conviction among the characters. The only real saving grace for this novel was its semi-realistic qualities concerning the nature of war and the normative tragedies of life itself. To save time, I'd recommend renting the movie instead......"
2,Disappointing for the Most Part,"An incredible story with some moving imagery, particularly of the retreat. Descriptions of the chaos, despair and the ebbing belief of the troops are particularly compelling. The dialogue was the problem, boring in the extreme and so unrealistic (unless conversation was really that different then)- It could have been amazing, but in the end it was a relief to finish the last page!"
3,Not Bad,It wasn't too bad for a book I had to read for school but it lacked the reality of All Quiet on the Western Front and Henry didn't seem to accomplish anything through the story.
2,conveys love like a paper cut-out,I can not understand how this has made it to so many top book lists. It was like reading catch 22 without the catch. I had the constant urge to skim the pages and be confident that I would not miss out on any important dialogue that would not be repeated again on another page or not be repeated on another page again. The love story conveyed love as well as a paper cut out conveys the moon.
1,SMELLY SOCKS,"I'd rather read tea leaves than ever read this book again. It's like smelly socks, sweat, and beer-stained undershirts: men stuff. A pre-schooler could entertain and enlighten me more than this goof Hemingway. Bitter men will enjoy it. All that misogyny is right up their alley; and as an added bonus, Hemingway rarely uses big, complex words or sentences, the easier for troglodytes to understand him."
1,Worst Book Ever,"This is probably the worst book I've ever read. It's completely boring, and the main character is a complete alcoholic pig. Like the theme that war is not glamorous, this book is definitely not glamorous. ~A. Brown"
2,whiny,"I thought this was a pretty good read till I got to the part where the guy suffers the double amputation.I mean, sure, that's a major blow and all, but did the narrator really have to spend the next 200 pages whining about his fate and reminiscing about the usefulness of his now-lost limbs?It would have been much better had he adopted a more hopeful note--perhaps centering his despair on the various kinds of prosthetic devices that were the obsession of so many of the ""Lost Generation"" writers.As it is, this book is just one long nostalgic memoir about the guy's missing and unrecoverable arms: most of it consists of him lovingly describing how he would use them to lift, swing, pull, etc., but now, tragically, must use his feet for these tasks.Such bizarre self-pity might have been okay for a few pages, but for 200? Honestly!"
4,One of Hemingway great books,"This is probably the most realistic book I've read so far. Hemingway's style is very simplistic and here he digs into the trenches of war, the people who figght it, and the reality of life.The dialogue between the American soldier who is fighting in the Italian army and the British nurse on the Italian front is borderline silly but I guess this is Hemingway's best portrayel of life and love.A great book and I highly recommend it."
3,A Soap Opera,"I re-read this recently. I don't know why. I guess a friend of mind is into Hemingway. Here's what I found: this seminal work of the American 20th century fiction reads like a chick flick or soap opera, especially the rather embarrasingly overwrought last chapter."
3,Disappointing,"Maybe I would have enjoyed A Farewell to Arms more if I hadn't had such high expectations. This is Hemingway afterall. But I couldn't believe the dialogue. At first I thought it was awkward because Hemingway was literally translating Italian phrases into English (which was easy for me to notice having studied Italian for several years). But it eventually became apparent that this was not always the case. The characters' speech seemed fake throughout the novel, thus making the characters hard to believe.If you're like me and sad endings ruin a book for you, don't read A Farewell to Arms. The romantic sections when Frederic and Catherine were together were wonderful. But the tragic ending lead me to want to create a different one for myself. Then there were the chapters describing the war which seemed to drag on at times. I found myself continuing to read just to get to the parts where Frederic and Catherine reunite.It had it's moments, but I don't think it was consistently great."
3,wartime romance,"I'm a tough sell on the romances and the historical aspect of this story didn't really win me over either, though it was my first and (so far) only Hemingway, maybe it was just that this story has been reworked so often? (oh and i saw the movie adaptation, ech, also not so highly recommended)."
4,A Classic,A Farewell to Arms was an amazing story during a terrible war. The hidden love affair between Lt. Henry and Cathrine culminated with tramatic results such as the War itself. This is a story that can not be left half finished. This is one of the great books of Ernest Hemmingway that can not be forgotten.
3,"Love, war . . . and tragedy.","A Farewell to Arms has a sad air about it that is difficult to miss. Surely, this is not a book of triumph, or happiness, or joy. It's the melancholic yarn of a certain Captain Henry (though narrator of the story, a very quiet man) and Patricia Barkley, a nurse.Their romance seems to be altered by the war taking place. Captain Henry, an American lieutenant on the Italian front, has to choose between his lover or the inevitable war - much like something from a Richard Lovelace poem.A Farewell to Arms is not the best book there is, and it's not an edge-of-your-seat page-turner, but it is a wonderful and sad story that tells of the power that war has over a man's life, and the mercilessness of that war itself."
2,Big Disappointment,A Farwell to Arms was the first book I read from Ernest Hemingway. It seemed like a book written for a male mind. The whole book was about love and war. It was hard for me to understand because it was dull and too easy to read. I thought Hemingway chose a horrible way to end the book. After all of the love that was built up between Frederick and Catherine I thought the end was a huge disappointment.
2,Two stars is being nice,"I read this book in eighth grade. It's been a couple years since then, but every time I'm looking for an example of a book with terrible dialogue, I pull out ""A Farewell To Arms"". I was actually beginning to become interested in Ernest Hemingway, but reading this book totally put me in direct opposition to him. First of all, the story is weak. Some books with weak story lines have outstanding character developement and a profound moral truth hidden in them - suffice it to say that this book has neither. All I can say is please stay away from this book... you'll glean nothing of value from it."
2,"Overall, this book lacks a source of intrigue.","This book, while portraying realistic portions of World War I, seems more of an attempt to boost the author's ego than to entertain. The way he (the author) has the nurse systematically slobbering over the wounded soldier is nauseating, at times to the point where it is more rewarding to skip the entire section. The only interesting parts that I found in this book were the battle scenes, too bad there were only one or two of them"
5,"Excellent, need I say more",This is the best book that I have ever read. Hemingway is a brilliant author who is able to touch the lives of many with his words. I found the characters to be excellent and the descriptions of the places excellent. I foubnd myself lost in this book.
3,Could have been better,"I found A Farewell to Arms very difficult to read all the way through. I thought this book was rather slow and jumped from thing to thing all the time. Although I did like the ending, the rest of the book just didn't seem worth it. I think it would have been better if it wasn't spread out over so many pages. If it would have been condensed then it might have gone faster. I know Hemingway is supposed to be a great author and everything but I don't think I could read another one of his novels because this one just wasn't very interesting from the very beginning. I could tell in the first couple pages that it wasn't going to keep my attention. Maybe I'll read it again in a couple years and see what I think of it then!"
4,Hemingway's beautiful love story,"I have been re-reading Hemingway. I had read this book so many years ago I did not remember it at all. It was a sad, beautiful love story. I'm glad I read it again."
3,Just Wait it out,"For those who are starting to read this book, do not be so quick to put it down. After the first 20 some chapters the book starts to get interesting. Ernest Hemingway's story is good but not exactly classic. His potrayal of the war description is good too but not excellent. Catherine and Frederick's relationship on the other hand is very confusing. At times it seemed like she loves Frederick, and at other times it seems like she doesn't want people to know that they are together. Overall the book was not that bad, although I do not recommend it, I give it three stars."
2,not what expected,"I'm a Spanish language speaker, but I decided to buy some books in their original language (english), and A farewell to arms was one of these. I found the story not much involved with the world war 1, neither presented to me as a great love story, since the love that arises is quite infantil. The rest of the characters appear in a too second plane, without further involvement. I think the worst part of the novel is definitively the dialogues between the couple: they seem to be the conversation of two 15 year old kids, who the only thing they can say to each other is the nicest and sweetest things ever; all they say to each other is ""you are awfully nice to me"" and stuff like that, and that, at least to me, lacks of interest to the reader. The story could have been much better, much more delightful, if this aspect had been more polished. The best is the end, and the inner thoughts of Henry, though is not the end we would have wanted to read."
2,Dissapointed,"This book, quite simply, was very bland. For one thing, it is too easy to dislike the protagonist (why should I like him?). I agree that the sentence structure and grammar is, at times, quite bizzare. Can anyone tell me why Hemingway always, always uses a contraction? I paid very close attention to the entire book and I found only one time where he did not use it (probably a mistake on his part). The story easily disinterested me, but there are some segments within the book that have some action, and can provide for some relief. Bottom line -- I hate the main character, story [was bad](granted, at times it is a little interesting) , sentences bad."
2,"Sorry, hated it","Hadn't read any Hemingway for 30 years. I remember his writing as to-the-point and without unnecessary embellishments - a style I like. I was really surprised by Farewell To Arms. I found the main characters unlikeable and the dialogue between them excruciatingly twee. Some of his literary devices seem clunky - e.g. the lengthy sentences at the beginning with many, many clauses linked by 'and.... and .... and'. The narrative got going with the retreat - finally some substance. Otherwise, the war was a picturesque backdrop to an endless succession of meals and drinks. A very disappointing read."
4,Kind of depressing,"This novel was far more interesting than I had expected it to be. Hemigway's personal problems were all over the place. The main theme of this book, as gloomy as it is, is that misery is part of the human condition, and that war is just one form of this. He purposely makes the end so depressing to illustrate that the tragic death of a love is even worse than the horror of war. Highly recommended, especially if you've been very concerned with the war right now."
2,"Not the worst, certainly not the best.","The story itself wasn't too bad, not exactly origional, but I've read worse. I found the characters to be rather flat, there was little development throughout the book. The dialogue, however, is the worst I have ever read. In fairly long conversations, the same thing is said ten times and the conversation as a whole never says anything new, or interesting. Not a terrible read, but I wouldn't recomend it, or ever read it again."
5,a true piece of literature,"I am only a freshman in highschool, and I know I don't get everything (or at least not as much as most) other, better educated individuals do. I do know that this is a great book. It is a love story and a war story wrapped together. Catherine Barkley(a British nurse)and Frederick Henry (an American ambulance driver in the Italian army)are a beautiful picure of love within war time. The lovers go through much to have a simple, peaceful life. They do accomplish this for a time. However, like other Hemingway novels the ending isn't ""happy"". Even though, I can't imagine it ending any other way. If you will take my advice, read this book. It is a wonderful experience."
4,This is A Masterpiece of Literature,"I'm a 8th grade sudent who is studying at International School Bangkok. This was my first time that I picked up the Hemigway story, ""A Farewell to Arms"". It was challenging for me to read it because I've studied English for only 2years. A Farewell to Arms is Anti-War literature, a masterpiece that is write with a themes about the vanity of war. It also shows us the essence of Hemingway literature. But I didn't really like the way that the author created the maincharacter as a hero, and there was too much dialogue, but the affectionate love of the story between Henry and his girl friend gave me warm and sad emotions."
4,It's a good one!,"If you like the Hemingway writing style, this is a great book. I enjoyed the story setting and resolution. Hemingway also has the ability to let you believe you are close friends with every story character. Highly recommended!"
3,Heart-rending finish but For Whom the Bell Tolls is better,"Farewell has such a tragic ending I sobbed, not cried with tears but just sobbed as if I had lost something irrevocably. The last third of the book is quite powerful, but I certainly thought For Whom the Bell Tolls was a better book. The comments here about thinly developed characters certainly strike me as valid, and I wonder if Hemingway meant to do it deliberately (why?). Sometimes Hemingway juxtaposes images of love and innocence with images of the cold and hard cruelty of life all in one paragraph. This can be enlightening and depressing at the same time. Again, though, the delivery in For Whom the Bell Tolls was smoother and less heavy-handed."
5,hemingway is the best ever,i feel sorry for all you people who thought that this book was bad. this is one of the best books ever written. anything written by hemingway is going to be an excellent book. if you like hemingway there's no way that you won't like this. it's classic hemingway and it is a great love story. it's one of the saddest books that i have ever read.
4,The More The Merrier,"As I read the first chapter I didn't imagine myself finishing the book. The repetitive descriptions were uninteresting. However, the more I read the book, the more I found myself enjoying Hemingway's work. I got caught up in finding the outcome of Frederick's love affair and the war. As always when reading a book you learn to look at certain thing at a different perspective."
1,Farewell...to this Book!!,"I also read this because I have heard a great deal about Hemingway. I have previously read The Old Man and the Sea, and really enjoyed that. But this book was torture.Someone else mentioned the dialogue, and they're right. It is the worst dialogue I have EVER read. I dare you to find people who talk like that! I know the book was written in the 50's or so, but there's no way people have ever spoken like this. Maybe the characters all had shell shock...And the whole love affair seemed strange. The girl hardly knew the central character, and was talking about love on the first date, all the while the guy didn't seem to care about her. I found myself hoping they would break up, just to move on. But, they don't. So, I skipped half the book and read the end. I suggest the same.Anyway, if you are looking to read Hemingway, I can only advise you to skip this book. Life is short, read a good one."
1,one horrible novel,"This has to be one of the worst books ever written. I don't understand the mystique surrounding Hemingway. There is no character development, the dialogue is juvenile and stilted and there is very little plot. I'll never get the time I spent reading this novel back; so do yourself a favor, and spend the couple of days it would take you to read this to read something worthy of your time."
1,Very bad.,"Bad reading; the descriptions are okay, but the characters stink. The heroine doesn't seem lovable and great, she's crazy and stupid. It's bad. The drawing on the cover is as good as it gets"
2,Boring,This pellmelled story was not only dissapointing but highly sad. My brain could not take the boredom come on Hemingway this story made you go down the drain. I highly recommend that you take a nice sedative before engaging in this book. Otherwise it will reak havoc on your brain. The story ws dumb the relationship between Henry and Caroline pointless. I do not recommend this story to anyone.
2,"Dull, dated Hemingway","Poor Ernest! Rather than retaining his modernist importance, his ""unadorned with a vengeance"" style and macho persona have fallen the way of parody and this, his ""best"" novel, clearly shows why. As with so many stylistic extremists, one finds oneself focusing on the writing and not on the written (the former bizarre, the latter dull and unconvincing). And his adoring women, ""hot"" for the hero, remind me of an old Mae West movie where the men, for no better reason than they were written that way, are constantly praising the invisible charms of our heroine. Time has moved on; so should we."
1,The WORST book of all TIME!,"I was actually looking forward to reading this but from page one I couldn't keep my eyes open. The characters had all the personality of wood chips! Infact, it would be more interesting to sit and watch the dog poop in my back yard petrify! I have never read such a boring book in all my life. It was EXTEREMLY hard to finish. It actually took me 1 month! And if I had to hear GOD'S name in vain one more time I would have burned the book, but it wasn't mine so UNFORTUNATLY I couldn't! Well, I'll will give it some credit..........the front cover is BEAUTIFUL."
1,Can we say 'Tripe?',"Horrible! I'm prejudiced against Hemingway anyway (for which the US may hate me for) but this book was filled with ridiculous characters and sexist themes. Hemingway just doesn't impress me--his short, superficial sentences seem to impress people in a world of silly television sitcoms, and that says a lot in itself. But I have read books of his that I liked better than this one. The romance is simply mush disguised by Hemingway's manly style and by including at least one different alcoholic beverage on each page."
2,Plodding,"Note that my evaluation of this book is that of a reader--not an English professor, or a lit/crit grad student, or historian. I am sure the book has many merits from those perspectives, where it fits in as far as the canon of American Lit., war books, etc. However, as a novel to be picked up and read for enjoyment, it must rank as one of the most boring and stilted I have come across. It goes nowhere. Nothing much happens for pages at a time. The dialogue is uninteresting, and the characters are surprisingly predictable and one dimensional."
4,Farewell to Arms,The book was delivered within a week. The condition of the book was good and the packing was adequate.
2,Farewell To Arms,"As I continue to read books that I probably should have read in HS I am constantly surprised by how much I dislike them and am convinced that the people who make these selections have no idea what it is like to be an average American male student. There is a reason why 15-18 y.o. boys generally dislike English courses in HS and I am of the opinion that it is because the people who think these selections are brilliant enter the field of education and continue the cycle of selecting books that have little or no appeal to the average male.Farewell to Arms is a dreary, monotonous, diary of inane conversations that only serve to introduce Frederic's tale of woe. The only interesting part is his escape from the police on the bridge and then their escape to Switzerland. It was a wonderful inducement to a good night's sleep for quite some time since I only read a few pages each night before falling soundly asleep."
2,"Dated, mundane, and journalistic.","Considering myself reasonably well-read, but never having delved into Hemingway, I picked up ""A Farewell to Arms."" I was disappointed. As a 20th Century novel, it pales beside the works of Evelyn Waugh, Mikhail Bulgakov, Somerset Maugham and even John Barth. ""A Farewell to Arms"" has not withstood the test of time. It is shallow, dated, predictable and characters are not well-formed. For a much better novel on the World War I era, try Ford Madox Ford's ""Parade's End."""
3,No Masterpiece to Me,"I read this book because everyone has heard of Hemingway and I decided to finally read a book by him, and it sucked, or I picked the wrong book. The novel is split into ""books"" and I only liked the last two. The female character of Catherine was--to me--annoying and unbelieveable, which might be a reason for my dislike of the novel. This book was ""Alright,"" which means ""Not Good."" I don't know if I'd recommend it to anyone."
3,That's Life,"Hemingway once again takes a plot that most writers would fail dismally at and manages to keep you intrigued to the end. The last 7 pages you think all is going well but he still has a surprise ending waiting for you. It's an anti-war novel to be sure, but that doesnt necessarily mean Hemingway is a pacifist. I was able to get through this book quickly and that says something for the smooth writing style of one of the greatest...Ernest Hemingway. For Whom The Bell Tolls is the best I've read of Hemingway, and I've read four altogether, the other two being Sun Also Rises and Old Man & The Sea."
4,A farewll to Arms,Ordered these books for a teenagers summer reading project. This was the only place that I could find all the ones she needed. Inexpensive and fast deliver.
4,A Farewell To Arms,Very interesting novel. The author participated in WWI and it is possible that some of the descriptions are factual.The outcome.....Please read it.
5,Very thought provoking and deep book.,"A Farewell To Arms has so much symbolism and learning experiences for every age. I am fifteen and it's my favorite book. I was expecting some stupid war love story, but there is so much more to it than that. The best book ever!"
4,A tragic story of war and its effect on young people.,"I do not understand Hemingway's genius. I agree he can tell a story masterfully with an economical use of words. (He probably could have written Conrad's 'The Heart of Darkness' in 500 words or less). But his characters seem so unemotional and he overuses certain words. How many times did he use the word darling? I liked ' Farewell' much better than ' The Sun Also Rises', which I despised. Frederick and Katherine were likable charcters thrown into situations that they could not control. I have not given up on Heminghway and I plan to read some of his later works."
4,Touching story,"This was the first time I read a book by hemingway, and I loved it. Don't mistake me...this wasn't an easy read. Hemingway has a style that isn't that easy to adapt to. He uses very simple words and phrases, and is a master at using dialogue. But no matter how you try to argue, a good book is a good book.This book tells the story of an ambulance driver, Lieutenant Henry, and his love affair with the nurse, Catherine, while being involved with World War One. They suffer many bumps in the road, and we are also shown the bad side of war, and how it is pointless.This is a wonderful novel. I will definitely try Hemingway again, but only after a little break. Yes he wrote well, but it's not easy reading."
2,"It has its moments, but generally disappointing","I'm 14, and I had to read this for school. It was the first book by Hemingway I'd read...and probably will be the last, at least until I'm forced to read another.I thought this book was dull in the extreme. It was full of huge passages of irrelevant small talk and pointless details. I also found the main characters, particularly Catherine, the female heroine, unconvincing as well as unlikeable.Although I didn't really enjoy this book, I respect it, and I realise that others might find Hemingway's style easier and more enjoyable to read than I did. Just don't expect it to be one of those unputdownable passionate war novels which you remember for the rest of your life."
1,A Farewell to Arms,"This has got to be one of the WORST books I've ever read. A number of us in our book club wondered how this book is considered a classic. The writing is terrible (For example the dialogue is not clear when the characters are having a conversation - you lose track of who's saying what. Also, some sentences are a half page long.) Hemmingway must have been high while writing this book."
1,ick,"I'm sorry but someone actually said the CATHERINE was what women want to be like. May I starve in Somalia first. (Actually, that's hyperbole. I would rather be a stupid peice of cardboard with no taste in men than die. But only just.) This book has a grand total of two things to recommend it. One, it is required to get an A. That's a reason right there. Two, it has a vocabulary a third grader could understand, thus getting the torture over with quicker."
5,Beautiful book.,"Did anyone else notice that the idiot named ""gnossie"" didn't read the book? What a moron."
2,Is plot not trendy?,"Let's see: Minimalist sentence structure, narrative, character development, and plot (especially plot). This novel reminds me of those rooms with one chair (wooden) and one window (no curtains) which we're supposed to appreciate. Less is more and all that. Is it, really? I had wanted to rent the movie, but am afraid it will be one of those long dark-scened things where characters talk (""meaningfully"") on and on and on."
1,Very disappointed,"Finished last night and found his writing style almost terrible with constantly repeated phrases, long run-on paragraphs, very slow moving - then little bursts of activity - then more long, slow repeated lines over and over again. Finally, the ending was just horrible. Both what happens, and the abrupt way he truncates the story. It was not worth the time it took to read."
2,A Farewell to Arms,"This was the first Hemingway book I've read...or I should say tried to read. I thought it was tedious, self-indulgent and boring. I always finish reading books, but I just couldn't bring myself to finish this one."
2,Not very enjoyable,"This is my second Hemingway book I've read after ""The Sun also Rises"". I had seen where this was a highly regarded novel, and a ""Classic."" I must say I beg to differ. This one was mildly better, but still not very enjoyable. It takes place during WW I and follows the life of an ambulance driver (which Hemingway actually was). The book picks up in the second half when the main character flees the army, but the ending was so depressing, I don't think I'll be reading any more Hemingway any time soon."
5,"A nice, steady read","This story is not too terribly difficult to write about because the reason it is so good lies in a couple of very subtle things. One of the most interesting things I found with the story is how relentlessly I wanted to understand more about the two main characters. This seemed to be planned from the beginning and as the closing chapters Hemingway has us rooting for their success. I fail to say more about the plot because there are about 5 or 6 total scenes in which the book takes place and I do not want to spoil anything.If you like Hemingway, you should certainly read this. If you are coming to this book for the first time and you're wondering whether to read it or some other Hemingway, I would recommend it highly. Either way you will get a good sense of what Hemingway writes through this, and some of my skeptical friends say that once you've read one, you've read them all."
1,Hemingway rode on the coat tails of F. Scott Fitzgerald.,"None of Hemingway's work including A Farewell To Arms should be touted as ""Classic"". Hemingway caught a ride on the coat tails of F. Scott Fitzgerald and without him as a predecessor Hemingway's body of work would have died the timely death it deserved. A Farewell To Arms is yet another example of Hemingway's inability to forward narrative in an interesting manner or to develop characters that anybody could care a whit about"
2,Megan's Review,"A Farwell to Arms, by Ernest Hemingway was overall not a book I would encourage others to read. In my opinion, if your interested in war novels, then yes I could give it a chance. But for my own interest, i'm not into war novels. Fredrick Henry was the protagonist of the novel; he was a ambulance driver for the Italian Army. You see many sides of Fredrick, but not enough for me to get into his head and relate to him. Fredrick meets a nurse Catherine whom he falls head over heals with her seduction, and loves instantly. The reader follows Fredrick's decisions as in leaving the war, his friends, and everything he was involved with behind for Catherine. Catherine and Fredrick go through many obstacles together, and find themselves moving to Switzerland until they got arrested by the police, but got away. Months pass, Catherine has her baby, but a tragic ending happens to Fredrick Henry. It seems like the same old novel about two star struck lovers who in the end can't be together."
4,great read..,"it was a page turner for me. if you enjoy works about ""wartime"" love and bravery this book is recommended. simple to read, and has a great love story. ending made me cry"
3,Typical Modernism . . . Typical Hemingway,"Ok, I am not the biggest Hemingway fan, but even I cannot deny the power of this book. It is honest and sensitive, while at the same time depressing and dark. There seems to be no hope at all in the lives of the two main characters, and this lack of hope leads us to expect the ending. The review on the back of the book says that this is the best novel to come out of WWI. I suppose it fits in that category--mirroring the modernist mentality of isolation and disconnection. It's not hard to read and you really can't put it down once you begin so be prepared."
2,Why is this a classic?,"I enjoy ""the classics"" and have read most of Hemingways works. This isn't up to par of the others and I would skip it. I had to force myself to read it."
2,overrated,"I'm consistently amazed at how revered Hemingway is, and at his status in American Literature. I've read three of his books and have never cared about a single character. In this novel especially, I find the dialogue wooden and tedious, often extending to lines of blunt interchanges with no hint at the way words are expressed or received. I don't expect a character to be handed to me neatly analysed and labelled on a plate, but some key focal points from which the reader can form an interpretation are essential in creating a relationship with that character. I find the central characters in this novel impossible to visualise.There are many more subtle and dramatic war/ anti-war novels, and countless better love stories.I just don't get it!"
3,"My first with Hemingway, maybe my last","Okay, I don't mean to be critical of Hemingway's writings. I mean I can hardly call myself an expert since I've only read A Farewell to Arms. And to tell the truth it's all I desire to read. The only reason I picked it up was because it was on my high school summer reading list. I know he's well known for his writing, but I found it rather asinine. I'm sorry, but his short, choppy writing style just didn't work with me. Maybe I like it when books go into deep detail and take awhile to say one thing, or maybe it's just that I haven't let Hemingway grow on me yet. The only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 is because I thought he did a wonderful job at portraying a love story during the brink of war. So if you must read this book, read it for the story line and not the author."
4,Excellent read,"Very good book. The Italians are drinking on every other page, which I found funny and the ending was classic."
3,This was a gift,"This was a gift for someone who collects Hemingway....guess what? He had this....but passed it on to a friend, and I assume it is appreciated by anyone interested."
5,Great,Love this edition of my favorite book. I love seeing the writing process and it's a great addition to my library of books from this era.
5,Amazing Book,It is an amazing book about an American soldier in the Italian army in WWI and he falls in love with an English nurse. I would recommend the book to anyone and everyone! Classic literature and Hemingway is truly a genius.
3,Romantic prose,"This was a very nice war-time romance, but not what I expected. The story, while always downplayed, is quite gripping at times. It's always interesting to track adventures across Europe in an unusual setting. Hemingway employs his famous journalistic style again. I get rather sick of Hemingway's ""strong characters."" I have never met people like these, I guess he has. Something just didn't click. I guess you have to be a Hemingway fan. Obviously, don't look for a story with a point. This is another documentation of a nit of human experience. Take it for what it's worth."
2,"The textbook was great, the print was pathetic","The quality of this book as a resource for physics is impeccable.However, the print is often unreadable with letters merged and blurry. The book is crooked, there is a 15ish degree slant on the top cut. The paper is as cheap as it gets. Had I known the pathetic low quality of this print, I wouldn't have even considered spending 50 dollars on this book."
1,"It is a great book, but substandard quality on paper ....","Yes, yes, yes...this is a great physics book. BUT, for top dollar, for a paper back you should expect top quality. This version falls short. My copy was freshly delivered with some machine created folds pressed in pages through out the book. Also the book seems to be bound using paper with the grain going in the wrong direction resulting in a very ""rumpled"" looking new book. The book looks as though it were created on a copying machine. The content is great - the book is poor. Try the hard copy edition - don't waste your money on this poor quality paper back edition."
2,Not Useful for Learning,"Way overrated. L&L lacks motivation and empiricism. Justifications behind their derivations are often specious. If you know the subject, it's a nice perspective. Otherwise, it's useless. Two stars, instead of zero, for their oustanding elegance. Based on previous raves, have read now V.1 and V.2 of their course of physics. Doubt that i will waste time on other volumes."
1,Low print quality,"First let me tell you that the content of this book is excellent. The low rate I'm giving is only for the low print quality of the particular edition I bought from amazon. The book is not cheap and I expected a nice printing, but it's not the case, many figures are blurry, the text doesn't look sharp and in general it looks like an scanned copy of the original edition."
3,A beautiful woman with cheap (but baught expensively!) clothing,"A masterpiece of classical mechanics!I strongly suggest using it as a supplement for your mechanics course.A brief but really complete presentation of the subject that must be studied carefully and read many times.Really beautiful !However 45$ is a RIDICULOUS price for this book!It's about 170 pages and the quality of printing is not that good.This book should not cost more than 25$, really. Amazon should reduce it's price or people will realized that photocopying it would produce a book with better (!!) quality and 1/3 of the price."
1,Don't buy the Kindle Edition,"Amazon, you should be ashamed! This is a wonderful, elegant book, it's the text for my 2012 fall course on graduate classical mechanics, and probably for many such courses worldwide. Most students could really use a Kindle edition--but this one's horrible! Practically illegible, the equations in particular. The beauty has been ruined. For $42, you can surely do better. I'd planned on getting the whole Landau Lifshitz series on Kindle, but not until you get your act together. Please, please fix this -- notice this book is fifty years old and still the best. It will be for a long time to come, so it's well worth redoing."
5,classic,"Brief, concise, elegant and to the point. One of a handful of physics books that I have kept many years after graduating from college. Highly recommend it."
2,can't understand the actors!,"I've heard good things about this movie, and decided to buy it. The only problem is that I can't really understand the actors. Their accent or something. I didn't know the movie was made in Scotland, but also thought I would understand the actors. I should have bought ""Together"" instead."
4,genuine,"having read the reviews here i can concur with those that question whether such a gritty film had to be made. But i do so perhaps for different reasons - i come from the town in question (Greenock) and can assure you it DOES reflect life as it can be in a town rife with unemployment and populated by many who dont have a clue what tomorrow will bring. Dark it is. Gritty too. But dont question its reality - if you want escapism dont watch it, but as a portrayal of life in many parts of the UK it hits the mark - and with a fair amount of humour too."
3,To clear up a few misconceptions...,"...the audience IS relatively quiet throughout the performance; they do NOT applaud too early at the ends of acts and, when they do, it is polite, muffled applause.The recorded sound is extraordinary for a live performance. The orchestra is clearly in focus; the voices benefit from the good stage acoustic of the Kirov Theatre, with just enough reverberance to make the voices ring naturally.My problem is with the music. It's mediocre at best. All of these type of Russian operas sound alike to me; they just go on and on and on interminably, very little change or variation, and in the case of Rimsky, lack of inspiration was often a factor. If you like Russian opera and/or ""Kitezh,"" however, I am sure that this recording will please you. Gorchakova's voice is absolutely gorgeous, and the rest of the cast is fine if not on the exalted level of individual singers of the past."
4,loved it,The music and performance were truly wonderful. No libretto to follow the 3 hours work but will play again soon
5,Just Cookin',"This book begins in a very poor district of a city in England during the Industrial Revolution. The division between classes is very notorious. I have to admit that I found myself struggling for the first 100 pages or so, but then afterwards I was hooked. I am not to unveil the main trama but this is the story of a man that fights his way up the slums (with some help) and at this point the author provides us with many surprises, up until the end of the book. Things that had been building up in the 100 previous pages finally start falling together in a carefully laid out fashion, and a very romantic way. The feelings are intense."
3,Good Fun With Shorter Running Time,"I have the original VHS release of this title. It was a lot of fun and always made me laugh. Then I bought this DVD release, which I later found out is mysteriously missing seven minutes worth of footage. Some of my favorite scenes are cut. Now I'll have to go back and buy the previous DVD release. Why they can't release it completely the second time around is beyond me. But what's here is great, so you might want to buy it anyway."
1,"Cut up good sketches, disappointing & missing sketches","I was looking forward to this DVD.Man, a let down.In all of the Best of SNL DVD's they always leave out fan favorites.A favorite bit of mine ""Super Fans"" we ONLY got the famous Michael bit and a cut up sketch.The Chris Farley Show. 3 cut up ones including the famous Paul McCartney one.Other famous sketches/characters 1 full sketch and then cut up ones. Matt Foley Motivational Speaker one complete sketch & then cut up ones.Showing him falling & his physical bitsJust a big disappointmentWHERE IS THE FAMOUS, I LOVE PARTRIDGE FAMILY SKETCH?"
2,loved it,This DVD was great and included all of my favorite sketches with Chris Farley.It has almost been a decade since he has been gone and I still miss him.
5,Long Live Chris Farley,"This video stands true to its name. Thanks to Chris Farley's incredible talent, this is my favorite SNL DVD. Granted, Chris Farley was one of the funniest comiedians ever to appear on SNL. From motivational speaker Matt Foley, to commentator Bennet Brower, this DVD induces one hard laugh after another. So, I reccomend you by this DVD RIGHT NOW. You will laugh until you wet yourself."
2,Ok,It starts very funny then gets kind of repetitive and a bit boring. Cool interview with Paul McCartney. I gave it 2 stars because if I had to do it again I wouldn't buy it.
4,New batteries work very well,"These new batteries replaced my old ones that just quit holding a charge. The price on Amazon was WAY lower than at the big box stores here in town. They work great, but if I were to do it again, I may have just purchased another tool that comes with a couple of batteries. The batteries work great, but when the sales are going, the cost difference to just get a new tool is not very significant."
5,Intermittent use for over 5 years,"I just ordered replacement batteries for the set I've had at least 5 years. They get typical 'honey-do' use by a typical weekend repair and project guy. (drill, circular saw, recip saw, flashlight) I just used them for a bathroom tear out and remodel which seemed to kill them both, but at least they limped across the finish line for me. I think you can recycle the old ones at Home Depot."
2,"dewalt 18v sytem is too much hype, not enough performance","I purchased a dewalt 18v combo pack( hammer drill ,circ saw , recip saw and flashlight) .My biggest complaint is with the batteries.Out of 5 batteries, only 1 still works. I just ordered 2 more because without batteries the tools are useless, so what do you do. I should throw the whole set in the trash and start over with a different brand, but that's a lot of $$$$.The recip saw variable speed doesn't work ,it runs only about half speed . The drill that came with the set burned up so I bought another one since I had the set and I do like the drill.With cordless tool sets you are sorta stuck with the brand you buy , unless you start over."
2,misleading seller,I purchased this with the ad stating it was factory sealed. it did not come that way. Batteries do work fine. it is just the seller mislead.
1,Ashamed of Dewalt XRP batteries,"I was really proud to buy Dewalt's kit with drill, sawzall and light kit with two new XRP batteries that came with them 6 years ago. One of them lasted to about ten charge cycles and yes I did charge them right using the instructions provided for proper battery charging and discharging. The other one died before twenty charges.So I got these two and I'll be darned if these XRP's didn't die out on me within a few months. I took one of them to a battery store but the cost was too high to replace the sub c cells in it and the lady there told me that two were fried and that it is a common fault with these type of batteries.I'm going to sell my Dewalt stuff and get some other brand that comes with decent batteries. For the price of these batteries it is easier to lug around a corded tool anyway. It is too much to pay Dewalt for batteries that last so short."
1,SECOND ONE DOES NOT WORK,THIS IS THE SECOND DEWALT FLASHLIGHT THAT WORKED ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME HEATED UP AND THEN STOPPED WORKING I WAS AWAY FOR A WHILE AND DID NOT HAVE THE CHANCE TO REPORT THIS WOULD LOVE TO GET ANOTHER ONE TO REPLACE IT BUT NOT SURE IF THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG THE BATCH OF THEM THAT ARE BEING SENT
2,18-Volt XRP 2-Battery- Do Not last!!,The tools are good but the batteries do not last. I have purchased 5 batteries and they are all dead. The last two did not run 2hrs in the last 12 months. Very disappointed in dewalt quality.
1,Charger?,Who posted pictures of the battery charger on the page that is for the batteries only. It makes it look like these batteries come with a charger.Now I have to returns these and get the battery that comes with a charger.
1,"constuction tools user,the world lithion bttery technology,please replacing nicad style heavy",please.advertising lithion battery to compatble new technology.cause nicad battery go out (completely death after year).i'm waiting for new lithion battery same insertion typical same model !!!!
1,junk Batterys,"I ordered the 18 volt XRP battery's because they were cheaper then anywhere else, but these battery's are worse then the 4yr old battery's I have, these battery's, both of them will not hold a charge for very long, they only charge for 5-7 min max, I have several 18v XRP battery's that I charge in the same charger cradle,and last for quite some time, but not the new ones, they only last for about 15 min working max, all I can say is it must be the nicad battery's inside the plastic housing that are junk, as the outside plastic of the battery looks new!!! not very happy to say the least, ""buyer beware"""
2,Not thrilled with this product,"I don't know what it is with DeWalt but their batteries are very lackluster. I have a charger with tuneup mode and even so, come about a year later they don't hold a charge. I don't feel good about these things being so ""disposable"" so to speak so I changed cordless brands and ditched all my dewalt 18v cordless for mostly hitachi. Some things, after years of use I decided were just never going to be that great in a cordless version so I am back to using corded saws for many apps. This battery was very disappointing and for the cost of it, i couldn't in good conscience recommend this battery to anyone."
1,Poor service life,My experience with these 18 volt DeWalt 18 volt batteries has been poor to say the least.Spent close to $300.00 for the original drill and battery set and the original batteries stroked out in a very short period of time. just long enough for the battery warranty to have expired.The battery charger worked just fine and was not the fault of the charger. I have had a Skill battery power drill with the original batteries that lasted close to 6 years and cost a fraction of the Dewalt setup. The cost of replacement batteries is outrageous in my opinion. So here is the choice you get faced with either spend another $100 bucks on new batteries or chunk the drill and go to another brand.DeWalt is a big name brand but the quality of the product i bought was very poor.I am sure there are thousands of very satisfied customers out there at a heavy price tag but I am sure there are those of who feel they have gotten their shorts burned off.
1,Short life batteries,I bought a DeWalt kit 4 months ago from Lowe's and the batteries are gone already. One died completely and Lowe's would not replace it and I had to call DeWalt. The other battery does not last long either. I will be looking at Milwaukee for my next set of battery operated tools.
4,Needed replacment batteries.,"I have had my present Dewalt 18V. driver/drill for 11 years. These are the second set of replacements I have gotten from Amazon (last set 6/2005)My 18v. equiptment gets moderate use and the batteries are charged every couple of weeks, so I consider $105 for these to be a good buy."
3,De Walt Battery,This battery didn't quit meet my Husbands standards for the DeWalt name. Didn't hold a charge like the other batteries he has used. He rated this as a 2 1/2 star item.
2,Short life,These batteries have a very short life. I have several that have not lasted even one year. I don't even use them most weeks. They also are bad about going dead over night or in a couple of days when just sitting in their case.
3,Dissappointed,"The ad was too good to be true, longer run time. I have four eighteen volt drills, two saws and flash lights, and a countless number of batteries. I'm always charging batteries and the new ones I bought don't last any longer then the others. I did need new batteries anyway but the hype about them lasting longer is bull."
4,Good batteries,"Love the batteries. DeWalt stays consistent. The only thing, as soon as I got them, a friend brought over his 18v Lithium ion batteries. They are just as powerful if not a little more, smaller and lighter battery. If I were to make the purchase over, I would have bought the lithium ion version. But, not disappointed with these batteries. They have worked well in my dewalt products."
5,They Work!!,They fit and they work. My old batteries are 12 years old and were starting to slow down. I was a bit concerned they wouldn't work in my XR2 tools but they do. The only bad thing was the packaging. It doesnt post what the number is on the plastic to know if my recycling center will take it. My center only recycles #1 and # 2 plastic. I can take the old batteries to Lowes to recycle them free.
3,Dewalt dc0096-2,"The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is that I think that the batteries should last longer.;;....You will kill them if you run them in the summer til they are hot to the touch then try and charge them right away.....Or, as in my case, you use and charge them in the cold. They also don't like getting wet. Boat owners have told me they only last a year on the salt water. Last winter I left my two batteries in my unheated garage with one of them plugged in all winter. The one that was plugged in never worked again and the other one only had about half of its capacity left. This was not Dewalts fault........I'm happy to get two new batteries for. The Dewalt tool system works very well. The weak link is, of course, the batteries. Mine lasted three years but it was my fault they needed to be replaced.------I have a number of friends who have never had a problem, some who use them every day, and others who use them once in a while. The killer of these batteries is temperature."
5,dewalt battery,The battery's were brand new in the origional blister pack as were advertised. They are a perfect addition to a drill pack. Very satisfied!
3,Batteries,The price of the batteries I thought to be A good deal until I found Homedepo had the drill and the batteries same price
4,DEWALT DC9096-2 18-Volt XRP 2.4 Amp Hour NiCad Pod-Style Battery (...,"Good price vs Home Depot. I could not pass up when I saw this. I did purchase a XRP cordless, XRP does suck up more power from the battery. Now I have 4 battery for jobs I do."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,UNFORTUNALY RECIEVING THIS ITEM WAS AN ISSUE BUT A YEAR LATER THEY ARE STILL RUNNING STRONG .. AND MY HUSBAND USES THEM NONSTOP IN THE CONSTRUCTION BUISNESS
2,be aware of the dates on these batteries,"these bateries are working fine, however the date on the batteries is 2008 this could make for a big problem with dewalt when you try to get them to honor there 3 year manufacture guarantee?????"
2,dewalt 18 volt xrp battery short life for the price we pay,"dear sirs I find it incredible the price we have to pay forthese 18 volt xrp batterys we use these in our every day workas marine tradesmen, the useable life span is extremely shorteven when properly maintained even when being depleted by useand then properly recharged with the DeWalt charger.I have owned my dewalt drill for three years and have beenmost happy with its performance it is both powerful andrelyable unfortunately as a mechanic of some fifty yearsthe battery performance sucks!"
2,dont bother,i bought a pair of these to add to my tally of 3 original batteries and the full charge only lasts HALF the time of the original set which came with my tools! the pair of XRP i bought were made in MEXICO not sure if that has something to do with it...
5,"Just as advertised, great batteries","I really like the XRP batteries. Last longer than my Ryobi ones by a long margin. Nice to get a pair of these for $75, too."
3,Battery review,"My first XRP batteries lasted for several years. The replacement batteries I have purchased last less than a year. I am not using them any less frequently, nor am I over-using them or drawing them down any more than ever before. There seems to be something about these batteries that has changed since Dewalt has come out with the Lithium technology as a replacement. If there were a good value combination of charger and Li batteries I would have tried that route, but I did not have the >$200 to drop on the conversion.All that said, I still love my Dewalt 18V tools."
3,DEWALT DC9096-2 18-Volt XRP 2.4 Amp Hour NiCad Pod-Style Battery,Very good product but battery life is only about 20-30 minutes of hard use. The 2 package set is needed.
5,dewalt replacement batteries,I was very pleased with the replacement batteries for my Dewalt 18 volt drill. They were the exact replacement batteries. The cost was half the price of Lowe's and Batteries plus.
1,two batteries for $110 is a ripoff,"I have enjoyed the various dewalt tools for the last 3 years, but when the time came to replace my old batteries I was shocked at the price. I think a company like dewalt should have more pride than to gouge their customers like this. Wouldn't it make more sense to satisfy the customers you already have than to drive them away with your blatant overcharging, then turn around and spend your profits on advertising to lure new customers?I will buy a new set of tools, including the batteries for slightly more than just the dewalt batteries alone. And I will avoid dewalt products in the future. This type of behavior is socially irresponsible in this day and age."
2,These are older batteries the newest are better,"This battery for standard performance is not worth it, they break if they drop and then your out $50. Alot of the time you can get a new drill with battery and charger for almost the same cost of 2 batteries"
2,Battery,I had planned to make a move to the lithiom ion 18 volt battery. The added cost and having to by a charger made me look up reviews on the new battery. The reviews changed my mind and I stayed with the old style batteries. The NiCad is heavy but thats all that I've ever used.
4,Dewalt 18 Volt 2 Battery Combo Pack,"I needed to replace the two original 18 volt batteries that came with my Dewalt 18 volt drill/driver as the batteries would no longer hold a charge. The DC9096 18 volt batteries look like the replacement but my drill was not listed as compatible with the DC9096, however, the probably was high they would be compatible so I ordered them. The new batteries work fine. Although they still represent the old battery technology. Neither Dewalt or Amazon offer a way to recycle/properly dispose of the old batteries."
3,Be careful with De Walt Batteries,"I have about twenty 18 volt tools &eleven; 18 volt batteries,half were dead in about a year! For about a year the batteries were great. here was never an issue with the tools.When I called De Walt for help I got a run round. The ""Customer Service"" was a joke. They either didn't care or thought I was trying to pull something. ""You have a receipt how do we know that is the battery covered? The date on the battery is too old."" The date the battery was made is on the battery post. Thus your battery could be 6 months old or more when you buy it. Some were dead when I opened the box.Be careful. If the battery dies fron use/non use you could damage the battery. This is stated on the MFG. Site/cust problems.I am buying more because of my tools. Recommend corded tools & look at less expensive brands if you are not a pro."
1,Short Life and Way too Expensive,"This is worse than replacing ink-jet printer cartridges !!! (could be debated)My second pair of 18 volt XRP batteries quit working, and they are not quite two years old!They have not been abused and have been properly maintained and charged. I even use Dewalt's reconditioning charger on them every so often.Dewalt ! ....these batteries should cost at least 60% less considering their longevity!Now, do I spend another $120 on two batteries that have 18 months of productive use ... or Buy the Hitachi Pro 18v Lithium Cordless drill, w/2 1.5ah batteries for only $159 ...hmmmmm"
5,Great,Love always having a charged battery. Being in the middle of a project and running it of attend power is so frustrating!
5,Dewalt XRP 18 Volt batteries,"We were already using this tool in our Electrical and Air Conditioning business in Tyler TX. This item was purchased to rig out a new truck. These work great, batteries last and interchangable with our other tools, lots of power, We use these tools daily. Highly Recommended, Russell"
5,MORE POWER,"The new DeWalt XRP DC9096 batteries have a longer run time then the original DC9099 and use the same charger! Great price at Amazon and I also get points with my Amazon Chase Visa, when Amazon is the seller!"
4,Good Value,"These batteries are a good value. They are indeed heavier than the new Li-Ion but they are also about half the price. In addition, since I have the Ni-Cad tools these fit perfectly in my tools where the new Lithium batteries don't. I had both Li and Ni-Cad in my cart and went with these. I am pleaed that I did."
5,dewalt batteries,This product came exactly as represented by amazon and arrived much sooner than i could ever imagined. kudos to amazon.com for amazing service
1,Beware Tool King - DC9096-2 batteries not as described,"Tool King orders for Dewalt's DC9096-2 18V batteries WILL NOT arrive as advertised on Amazon in original clam-shell package. Tool King claims these are bought in bulk from Dewalt, and if they were refurbished they would have an ""R"" stamped on the side or bottom - which they do not. Are they new or refurb? I have no idea. What I do know is that they are not the Dewalt DC9096-2 item as described, but rather two (2) loose DC9096 batteries. Buyer Beware."
4,the tools last longer than the batteries....,"which is true, I think - I'm on my 3rd set of replacements now, works out at about every 2 years for as long as I've had my tools - they get a lot of useage.One tip of advice, keep these batteries warm - I mistakenly left my last set out in the garage over winter (in NJ, so it's not too bad) and they both died a death - I put them away charged, came back a couple of months later, they were flat, and I was unable to recharge either of them. Now I keep them in the basement, they last whilst not in constant use.I've had to replace the trigger on my hammer drill / driver and the brushes once. At least the dewalt website allows you to buy any spares to replace yourself...Interesting how the single battery costs $85, yet you can buy this two pack for $98... does this mean that Dewalt can really sell a battery pack for $13....? think about it."
5,Grear Batteries,I needed replacement batteries for my dewalt tools. I received two batteries for what I could buy them in the local retail store for one.
5,great price,This is the best price I have seen for these batteries.I was very pleased and they have performed without a problem.
1,Rock Sales has no regard your customers.,Rocks Sales sells cheap and damaged Dewalt batteries and do not respond when confronted about it. $200.00 down the drain!
4,Fit well,Only used them a couple of times so far but they fit my tools well and recharge as I thought they would.
3,Dewalt NiCad Battery,"This is my third set of Dewalt Batteries. These batteries don't last long in warmer climates. Thus through trial and error I have finally learned from the previous 2 sets to keep them not stored in my garage but indoors in a cool spot. My doing this, one can extend the over-all life of the batteries 2 to 3 times longer, at least this has been my experience. When the batteries are fully charged they have a lot of power. I truly hope this helps others."
4,Big Mistake Purchasing from this Seller!,"Delivery date was almost a month from date of purchase and product was still late (my credit card was charged when purchased). After multiple requests for a tracking #, the seller responded. However, the tracking # wasn't activated for almost 2 weeks after his response. During this time, I asked him to cancel my order and refund my $$. I did not receive a response, but several days later the product FINALLY shipped. When the product arrived, it was wrapped in a plastic bag, rolling around in a box with absolutely no packing material or padding. This was by far the worst service I have EVER received from an Amazon seller. I would caution anyone else from buying from this person.I rated the item a 4, but only because it seems to be in good working order. However, I would have rated the service a 0."
5,Good tool brand.,I bought these batteries for my husband for Christmas. He loves Dewalt tools and was pretty happy when he opened them as a couple other batteries won't hold a charge for long.
3,"Replacement Batteries, no frills",Replacement batteries at a decent price. Not much else to say. They work. Wish they laster longer and didn't require as much maintenance. Lighter would also be better.
2,Not a SALE Price,"You can buy this two pack of Batteries in the factory sealed package for $99.00 at Lowes Everyday, not on Sale."
5,Great reading for little kids!,"While the publisher says this book is for 9-12 year olds, my 5- and 6-year olds love it! The stories are short - most can be read in a few minutes. They are written in a very exciting, but simple style that grips the attention. It's a hard book to put down. Stories discuss such great Americans as Washington, Franklin, Fulton, Kit Carson, Audubon, Goodyear, and more. I can't recommend this book enough for young readers. It's also suitable for those who are learning to read and want to read something interesting."
1,THIS EDITION DOES NOT HAVE ILLUSTRATIONS,"The paperback (yellow) edition does not have pictures, rather it has placeholders for the images (as if there were an error in typesetting.)The text content, however, is fantastic for children.GET THE HARDCOVER, (RED) EDITION - IT HAS THE CORRECT ILLUSTRATIONS."
3,"IT WAS TOLERABLE, BUT IT'S KINDA SILLY","THIS QUICKLY MADE MOVIE, WHICH WAS INTENDED TO CASH IN ON THE HOT TV SERIES, IS SOMETIMES UNEVEN. THE CAPED CRUSADER [ADAM WEST] AND THE BOY WONDER [BURT WARD] BATTLE THE JOKER, THE RIDDLER, THE PENGUIN, AND THE CATWOMAN. LET ME JUST SAY THIS; THE MOVIE WAS OK, BUT THIS MOVIE AND THE TV SHOW WAS SERIOUSLY MAKING BATMAN LOOK LIKE A JOKE. ANYWAY, LIKE THE TV SHOW, IT'S MUCH FUNNIER THAN IT IS SERIOUS. BUT, IT SHOULD PLEASE THE FANS OF THE TV SHOW."
4,"Good sober, but better in other states of consciousness","Watch it stoned, it will not disappoint, OR it will disappoint so much that you will be impresseed.Also I've never seen such lazy script-writing in all my years of yore."
3,"Holy Bat Crap, Batman!","Man... what can I say? This is like watching a comic book from the 60's. Its so cheesy that I felt myself becoming stupider watching it. Adam Wests dramatically over acts, however the villians are pretty good. So take everything you know from the Frank Miller Batman and trash it. This is the cheesey-out of shape-one liner Bats that for some reason... I seem to enjoy watching."
4,Fun movie,I'm not a batman fanatic but I got this video for my 4.5 year old son. He certainly enjoys it! Even my husband and I get a kick out the movie:) I would certainly recommend this product.
4,A great DVD.,"It's a hilarious movie and the DVD hits just right. I always loved this movie. The old TV show was always fun to watch. With over 250 guest stars throughout it they always brought in great actors to play thew villains, and they make stellar performances in this film.The sound is great the color (as Burt Ward will tell you himself in the commentary) is magnificent. And speaking of the commentary, I was so excited to see that this DVD included commentary by Adam West and Burt Ward. What they have to say is interesting and funny. If you liked the film you'll love this DVD. It doesn't have that many special features, but the ones it does have makes it worth your while."
4,Batman-the movie,"Holy mouldy Batman!!! What an absolute treat. The commentary with Adam and Burt is loads of fun. The colors are right out of a comic book and the script is right off TV. During the first season my assignment for American Government class in high school was to watch this TV series each week, so I saw them all-except the movie. It's a nastalgic look back into innocent campy escapism from an era that brought us Man From U.N.C.L.E. and I Spy and of course Get Smart. I consider this a one-of-a-kind movie which can never be matched. I consider this a must have for a well rounded DVD collection."
5,FOX DOES RIGHT BY THE BAT!,"A stunning transfer and extras package by Fox that shames the shoddy barebones treatment Warner has given the film franchise. This was clearly put together by people with great affection for the source material, and it was an absolute masterstroke to sign West and Ward up for a commentary track! Given the excellence of this disc, this film and its tv equivalent may finally get their due as the brilliant satire its creators intended."
5,Batman! Batman! Batman!: My first childhood hero.,"This is probably the best batman movie for all true Batfans. The original characters played by Adam West and Burt Ward are at their finest. This movie shows you why after 35 years, Adam and Burt still are viewed as the only Batman and Robin."
5,FANTASTIC!! -- But where are the DVDs of the TV series!!????,PLEASE RELEASE ALL THE TV EPISODES ON DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Adam West is still the best !!,"Adam West will always be Batman to me.I know the show was campy,but it was supposed to be.If you are looking for a good time and reminiscing about years gone by buy this movie.I saw it when it was released in theaters.I was 15 at the time.The villians are all the best Cesar Romero,Frank Gorshin,Burgess Meredith and Lee Meriwether.I did wish Julie Newmar had played Catwoman.What a goddess !!The picture quality is great on widesceen T.V.The bonus features are nice too.You can't beat the price.GO FOR IT !!"
4,POW!!! ZAP!!! CLANG!!!,"Great flick! The action scenes are fantastic! The scene where the shark attacked Batman was absolutely terrifying. The shark looked totally realistic! I thought it was going to bite Batman's leg off. POW!!!There's also a scene in which Batman has to avoid a huge bomb. BOP!!! Batman narrowly avoided certain death. It was really scary. If you have young kids, you might want to keep them away from this movie - this movie will give them nightmares for years.. KABOOM!!!The producers spared no expense in creating this movie. This is definitely one of the most realistic action movies ever. Watch it.BLAMMO!!!"
1,on line download from Amazan would not work,I don't know if this movie is any good because I could never get it to download online via Amazon.. Multiple browsers and attempts were tried... it started to download or connect and then went nowhere... no good directions from Amazon's tool on how to correct it (load a plug in ? different browser?) were offered that solved the access issue.
4,Batman Movie,"Very happy with vendor and prompt service. Movie not quite as good as TV shows. Seemed to drag with less action scenes and lacking the classic splats, pows and other effects in original series. Overall satisfied."
3,Batman on tv series,This movie remind me my childhood when all of us wanted to be heroes. This is to be kept as a reliquia.
4,A ton of cheese...,"What I loved about this movie and the TV show was that Adam West, Burt Ward, and the rest of the cast played it completely straight. It's so campy and over the top, but they were never self conscious about what they were doing. They weren't being ""ironic"" or detached. That's one of the main reasons why the show worked so well. Of course, the dialogue and situations here have to be seen and heard to be believed (my favorite is the dolphin who sacrifices his life, so that Batman and Robin may live). A ton of cheese, but really good cheese."
3,Infinate Lameness!,"This has to be one of, if not, the lamest thing I've ever seen in my life. I really feel sorry for Bob Kane when I see this rendition of Batman. I can't even go into all the cheap outs...the lame so-called special effects, the totally fake fighting scenes, the rediculous over-acting of all the actors...so why did I give it three stars? Well...that's why! It's hilarious! In it's utter propostarity, this film made me totally crack up. So, if you want to see a REAL Batman movie, see Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. But if you're just in for some cheap laughs and a good time, check this out."
1,"Holy Crap,Batman! This movie sucks!","I'm not even sure where to begin about this god-awful nightmare of a movie.All I can really say is that,that is a TOTAL disgrace to Batman's name and character.Since when does Batman fight crime in the daytime? Kinda defeats the whole purpose of being the ""dark knight"" doesn't it? And Boy Wonder Robin is just a high school nerd in tights.Complete Camp Crap...just like the 60's show.Any TRUE Batman fan would hate this as much as I do."
1,Ha ha! It's funny!,"This film was the dumbest thing since alien pops with cheese, but I loved it! ""Wham! Bap! Zang!"" were constantly being showed in combat scenes. Batman Forever was the best because it was seriouse (see my review on it), but this film (although stupid) is downright funny! Ha ha! This movie does not (or so it seems) even make an attempt to be serious. See it anyway and laugh you pants off!"
1,bat-bore,"Oh dear,my mates will hate me for saying this but I had a really hard time sitting through this.I loved it when I was a kid but seeing it now I just found it way too tedious,boring and far too long.For die-hard fans only."
3,It's okay,"This movie wasn't that great. It is pretty stupid how they find out that the Joker, the Penguin, the Riddler, and Catwoman are teamed up to turn the world leaders into dust. Robin needs some new lines. ""Holy Halloween."" What the f***. In every sentence pretty much for him has the word holy. I don't see why in every sentence he doesn't say holy s***. Anyway the movie wasn't that great."
4,A CLASSIC PIECE OF HOKINESS,"I like everything Batman, except for the sequels that followed the 1989 movie, and this is one of the best incarnations. Though it looks cheesy by todays standards, that's really what they were shooting for back in 1966. I loved the bonus features and especially the commentary by Adam West and Burt Ward who let the viewers know that they also were'nt taking this seriously. My favorite is when Batman and Robin are trying to separate the dehydrated dust and are wearing doctors masks and aprons and Adam West says ""look at these two idiots."" Also if the execs at Fox are reading these reviews, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE ON HANDS AND KNEES, release the show on DVD!!!"
3,Great movie but get on Dvd,Well I love this movie...but i bought this blu ray thinking it would be a much better version then the Dvd one i own but it is the same version the only difference is the extra's.. Which im more about the movie but the extra's are cool.. But if you just want the movie and could careless about the extra's just get the Dvd the is no pic difference I saw
4,Greatest Movie of all time,Batman The Movie. The only movie that comes close to this version of Batman is Batman and Robin. Though this version is much better done and leaves out the bickering between the two main characters. Amazing picture & sound quality.
4,Classic!,For the diehard tv series fanatic! If you enjoyed the tv series you will like this! Much different than the modern theatre version!
5,Adam West's Batman is the best Batman!,This movie is hysterical. The scene with Batman and the shark is worth the price of this DVD. It's also always good fun when several of Batman's Super Villains are together and working as a team like they do in this movie.
5,This Is Batman!,I gave 5 stars to this movie because this is the Batman I loved watching as a kid and I knew it would be safe for my 4 year old Grandson to watch. He is starting to get into the super heroes now and loves Batman. He wanted to watch The Dark Knight and was so sad we said he couldn't. So this made our little man happy again! :-)
4,Awesome!....and hilarious,"Ha! This movie is great! We can watch it with our 3.5 yr old! Batman & Robin at their finest & quirkiest:)! Very age appropriate and fun for all of us to watch. Highly recommended ""family movie""!"
5,Riddle Me This!,"For a segment of the Baby Boomers, Batman is Adam West, Robin is Burt Ward and comic book fun reigns supreme. Then, a ""Dark Knight"" would be spelled a bit differently and mean cloud cover at midnight.This 1966 movie features four villains - The Joker (Cesar Romero), The Penguin (Burgess Meredith), The Riddler (Frank Gorshin), The Catwoman (Lee Meriwether) - who combine forces as The United Underworld, with the goal of turning the nine United World Security Council members into multicolored crystals. It is up to the Caped Crusader and the Boy Wonder to save the world from this fearsome foursome.Originally planned as the pilot film for the TV series, the movie was produced between the show's first and second seasons. The movie is a fun romp of 105 minutes - there are several bonus features included - and clearly shows that The Joker isn't alone in saying, ""A joke a day, keeps the glum away!"""
3,Is this worth a double dip?,"Features NOT listed. The original is anamorphic ws & hsd some nice features. It'd be nice if Amazon would tell us what is on this ""Special Edition"". I don't know whether to keep my 2001 released dvd or buy the new one & without information you really can't make a proper decision."
2,I'd forgotten how bad it is,"Like many things from childhood, there's a sheen to them that can only exist in memory. A childhood home will look smaller, a favorite food won't taste as good, and The Batman movie will be revealed to be a horribly campy Bat-disaster.Having enjoyed the Batman series as a child, I was surprised to return to it as an adult and find it jarringly bad. Even nostalgia didn't allow me to watch the entire thing."
3,This Ain't your Grand Sons Batman,I remember seeing this as a kid and it was nostalgic to see it again. Very corny would be a good way to put it. I would recommend it for children under seven or for adults over fifty that want to remember when.
4,"Nostalgic fun Tv, release more !","This was fun as a kid and still good now with a few drinks.If Twentieth Century Fox released all the episodes it would be great, we get to see all the crazy villains, also The GREEN HORNET & KATO vs. Batty and Robby on DVD!? BRUCE LEE makes a cameo . Nostalgic fun"
3,USELESS DOUBLE DIP! SAME DISC NEW BOX,If you love all things BATMAN then you'll enjoy this childish adventure. If you already own the previous DVD you do not need to buy this...there is nothing new to offer. It is a reissue in a new box...all the content is the same...down to the transfer!
1,SAME AS THE 2001 RELEASE,Well I purchased this 2008 version and have learned it is identical to the 2001 release. All the interviews are from the last release. The only difference is the packaging ! All the interviews mention the 35th anniversary of Batman the series but we are now at a 42 year anniversary. Its a great movie with wonderful extras but it would have been nice of Fox to add a little something extra since they re-released this disc. If you own the 2001 edition as I do you will be disapointed spending more money for a package with a red bat. Well I guess that is one way for Fox to ride the coat tails of Warner Bros pending the new Dark Knight movie.Do not waste your money on this edition if you have the 2001 edition !!!!
5,Classic Movie - highly recommend,This is an awesome movie. My 13 year daughter and I have been watching the series on cable recently and its been a real blessing sharing it together and the movie was just as good if not better. The newer movies are too dark and predictable. These older movies are so much more fun to watch with the family and the slapstick and the actors are awesome.
5,TIMELY AND QUALITY,Very good was sent it a quick and timely matter.I was very satisfied with the quality of the product as well.
5,Fun!,"This movie, starring Adam West and Burt Ward as Batman and Robin, kept up with the 1960's campy version of the series it spun off from, and was just plain fun to watch.I purchased this movie for the purpose of reviewing it for Classic Cinema Online, as I'm comparing live action Batman from the 1940's to the present, and am enjoying their many differences. This movie, as cheesy as it is, fits right in - no disappointments here!Of all the Batmans, this one makes for the best family entertainment, being suitable for children of all ages, and I highly recommend it because of how fun it is to watch.I ordered this new and it arrived on the day anticipated in excellent condition."
4,The Classic Batman!!!,"After I saw The Dark Knight, I went back and watched the original classic movie from the 60's! It's a pretty good movie, although you can tell some actors may seem very melodramatic! I love when Batman tries to get rid of the bomb, but people keep showing up. If you are looking for gothic and scary Batman, this isn't for you, if you are looking for cheesy and comedic Batman, you'll love BATMAN: THE MOVIE!p.s. In 1994, when I was age 4, I was Batman for HALLOWEEN, and we have it on tape and I was dressed as Batman and I was watching this movie. My mom said ""It's Batman watching Batman!""p.s.s. Back in October on the final day I filmed my movie, Pumpkin Man, this came on tv, and I watched it!"
5,"BLAMMO, Batman, what a delight!","This is what the DVD format should be used for more frequently! An excellent, clean transfer brings the original movie to life with vivid colors and good sound. All the fun and subtle verbal wit (nothing obvious or vulgar) is here. A nostalgic delight and I'm sure it's a surprising find for the younger set.Let's hope they are working on putting the Batman TV episodes on DVD in the same classy way."
5,"This is Great,",I ordered this for my grandson - who is 4 years old and we both love it....we can watch this over and over and over .. Nocursss words no nudity something we can both watch and enjoy...love it..the sad thing is that this is not my first review the other reviews were about things I perchased and did not like so you did not post the bad reviews...
2,Seems hopelessly dated,"The original ""Star Trek"" seems less dated than this. Great for entertaining kids and on the adult side (aside from the ambiguously gay relationship between Bruce Wayne and ""ward"" turned boytoy Dick Grayson) the Catwoman is adorable, especially in her turn as a faux James Bond-esque Russian hotsty-totsy reporter romancing Bruce Wayne. But my God, Shatner didn't have as many dramatic pauses!And what was up with marking the Bat Ladder ""Bat Ladder""? I realize this was before ""Jaws,"" but if you're going to have a shark attack, don't have it with an obviously fake shark.In the interest of full disclosure I was never fond of the original Batman series."
3,Hilarious.... but not the best,"This is a very controvershal movie. some(like myself)like it, others consider it a mockery to the entire Batman continuity. But those who despise it should read a book that reprints Bat-comics from the 60's. If you do you'll see that those comics sucked big time, so warner bros. had to camp Batman up to create any hype whatsoever.try not to expect a serious, dark Batman in this movie;expect campy, cheesy comedy. I laughed like hell when I saw Batman and Robin apearing at a press conference.Still, this film is to one-dimensional, cheesy and campy to be campared to the later Batman movies. To those of you who think this this is ""the best of Batman"" and that the later Batman movies were too serious.... read a more modern Batman comic see that the Batman mythos has changed."
3,Good for its day.,"This movie is pretty horrible. But I'm a huge Batman fan, and want everything that he's done on video. It worth watching once, but after that, I haven't picked it up again. I gave it 3 stars because it was good in its day. A must for any Batman fan."
4,Batman - The Movie 1966,"Pow ! , Thwack ! , Zwapp ! . Yes this movie are created for kids , but also for adults how been kids ! . When Batman (Adam West 1928-) and Robin (Burt Ward 1945-) Get a tip that Commodore Schmidlapp (Reginald Denny 1891-1967) is in danger abour his yacht , they launch a rescue mission . But the tip is a set-up by four of the most powerful Villains ever , who seek to defeat the dynamic duo once for all ! . Armed with a Dehydrator that can turn humans into dust . This Fearsome Foursome inted to take over the world ! . Can the Caped Crusaders use their high-flying heroism and groovy gadgetry to declaw Catwoman ( Lee Meriwether 1935- ) , Ice the Penguin (Burgess Meredith 1907-1997) , upstage The Joker (Cesar Romero 1907-1994) and stump The Riddler (Frank Gorshin 1933-2005) in time ! . Superb Digital transfer in High Quality"
5,This is how to make a DVD rock!,"How can you beat a DVD that features the commentary of Adam West and Burt Ward? The color is pristine, from the opening 60's title sequence to the end credits. Nelson Riddle does true justice to Neil Hefti's addictive score, and the plot is still beautifully absurd and naive. Leonard Maltin's review proves once again that he wouldn't know comic genius if it hit him in the face with a cream pie.The menus and features on the DVD are true to the series, with BIFF! POW! and ZAP! punctuating every menu choice. Hats off to the DVD programmers of this great product. I hope 20th Century Fox releases BATMAN episode collections of this quality."
4,Just like I Remember,"Introduced the movie to my 8 year old son and his friends to thr ""old"" batman... they loved it. If you like the old batman you will like this."
3,Beware,If you already have The Once Upon Series then DO NOT buy this book. If you don't you will enjoy this book. Nora Roberts' is a fantastic writer and this is a rerelease of her earlier works.
1,Never to Nora,"My mother lent me this book, she thought I'd enjoy. HA! it was the worst load of garbage. If this was her early work she should have left in the box! Is she hard up for cash? The plotlines were all begged, borrowed, and stolen. The characters were square (which means not developed roundly). The sex scenes were overplayed or underplayed depending on how you tumble. Her male voices were lacking. She couldn't even find new names for the characters - had to borrow them from other authors. I have never read any of her other books and now I certainly never will. I'm told she is a very good writer, so shouldn't she have known better than to publish this drivel? My brain/senses need(s) a day of bad television to wash the haunting memories of a bad book away. Even Matlock reruns would be better! I know that sounds harsh, but gosh, this book was really truly horrible!"
3,Started out well enough,"This book started out well but I wasn't enchanted with the ending. Marissa Quinn is a cattlewoman from Montana who flies to Seattle to visit her sister Leslie when she gets a disturbing letter from her. In Seattle she meets David and Diana Woodward, two peculiar people who seem to be hiding something. Alek is warrior from the time of the Druids and the Romans who has been brought forward in time into Marissa's world where he can amazingly speak and understand the language. He knows that he has a limited amount of time in the new world and he may never get back home if he cannot perform the ritual with the Night Orchid. While I enjoy Patricia Simpson's stories about the paranormal and time travel, I was not overjoyed with this particular book. There was a story line, it was just not my kind of story. It was however, well written."
1,Avoid At All Costs!,"We ran out to get this DVD the day it came out! When we got home and put this in for my son, we were horrified to learn that we paid money for a TV episode that we have taped many times over on PBS Kids. It is a nice episode but you can get it for free on TV. There should be a warning on the box that this is from TV show and SEEN BEFORE!"
1,Blank Disc,"I haven't had time to contact the seller of this item, but when I received the DVD it would not play. I think it is blank. I would like to send it back & receive a new one."
1,bad review,"The Dvd that amazon sent me only worked one time and then it broke. I left the country the day after I receieved it and did not have time to send it back. I called and tried to get through to a customer service rep once, but I was put on hold for 10 minutes. I eventually hung up and I am now stuck with a broken dvd. What a waste of money."
4,Here's an inside look at a bygone life by an old cowman that was handy with a rope and a typewriter!,"Lester Reed had a simple, direct way of writing that brings the reader an everyday look at the life of a desert cowman at work around 1900. He masterfully weaves his tales about desert life with stories of family, quirky friends, and hair brained schemes involving desert trips in search of gold mines and ghosts. He did and saw it all. Great cattle empires are built, herds are driven, and travel goes from burros to Model-T's. If you want a very personal, simple look at the real world on the great deserts of far southern California then you will love this book by Lester."
1,HORRIBLE! Pages Ripped out!,"The book was missing pages as various pictures and pages had been ripped out. Usuallly, this vendor gets it right. Unfortunately, this one slipped thru the cracks. Very disappointed with book."
5,"WOW! So much better than ""Dead to the World""","With an exciting array of flashy music videos, almost an hour of great concert and backstage footage, it's a big wonder why this hasn't been put to DVD yet. I just wish that the music videos were chronologically ordered and that it would show ALL of each of the live songs. They cut off too quickly. It's still cool.CIAO,COOKIE MOSES"
5,"Ooooooh, wow","In a world full of sugary pop princesses and arrogant tryhards, One artist rises above them all. Antichrist Superstar aka Omega aka The Angel with the scabbed wings. Marilyn Manson. All the best film clips are here (Coma White, Man that you fear, Long Hard Road out of Hell, Dope Hat) Plus some very funny appearances in the backstage sequences (See Twiggy and the fake gun, Or Manson throwing stuff at John5) Its probably highly advisable not to watch this with your parents (or siblings) around. But this is totally amazing. dont miss it."
4,Great video on endangered species - for young adults +,"This is quite an entertaining and educational video - the reviewer above is quite correct in saying that some parts are difficult to watch, but they are not arbitrarily thrown it. Viewers are confronted with images which illustrate the many ways in which species face eradication due to poachers and hunters. It underscores the need for the conservation efforts such as those of the San Diego Zoo, whose work is highlighted here. Whoopi is fun, but the video is not ""funny"" - and it is definately NOT for young impressionable viewers. Great for middle school and up."
1,In the Wid: Baby animals with Whoopi Goldberg at the San Die,"I purchased this video because my young grandchildren wanted a video on baby animals at the zoo. I was horrified when my 6 yr. old granddaughter was watching it (I wasn't paying close attention) and said that a part was so sad. I rewound it, and much to my horror, they showed the killing of baby chimps in some third world country. this was not exactly what I had in mind!!!"
5,Hilarious and educational at once,"John Cleese expertly blends his trademark dry sarcasm with traditional documentary narration. I caught this as a rerun on my local PBS station in the middle of the night and found myself laughing out loud at his many unexpected comments. One scene where he calls the lemurs, ""You bastards!"" just slayed me."
5,Highly enjoyable and fascinating,"An excellent documentary! Robin Williams brings a special warmth and antic humor to this beautifully filmed show about one of nature's most interesting animals, the dolphin. If you love the sea and it's animals, this program should not be overlooked. Just observing Williams' wonderful relationship with the subject matter makes this video one to view over and over again."
4,Revealing portrait of Mongolia,"I don't know why the other reviewers keep talking about orangutans. This is a DVD about Julia Roberts visiting good horse riders in Mongolia. The same show can be seen onthis Nature DVD. This episode with Julia Roberts is a fascinating portrait of life of Mongolian nomads. The whole point of having Julia Roberts in Mongolia is that while she is a ""star,"" she isn't any better acclimated to life there than any other American. So we get to see Mongolia through her eyes as we would probably experience it ourselves. I think it's likely that, because the Mongolian horses are only semi-domesticated, Roberts wasn't as fascile with them as expected. That's okay. If you have any interest in Mongolia, this a great DVD to own."
4,"Lemurs with John Cleese, can life get better?!",I had been looking for this movie for a while and I was really glad when I found it on the seller's page. If you love nature documentaries and John Cleese then what's not to love about this?? It's reaalllly funny.
5,Excellcent- Very well done. Funny but honest spokes person.,"Goldie Hawn was excellent in this presentation of the elephants of India. What expirence to see these magnificent creature. They need more programs like this on TV, to make people aware of the help they need from being extinct. Something needs to be done to these poachers. I wish I could afford to go on a trip like that to help save the elephants or any wild animal like that. If you ever need any help sending out any kind of literature, you can count on me for help. It is a great cause. The animails can't save themselves from us, only we can."
4,Hilarious and Educational,"I first saw this video during a Primate class in college. Not only does John Cleese love the lemurs he travels so far to see, he also explains details about the various breeds. His comedy shines through as well. I recently attended his lecture at Trinity University, and he stated that this was his favorite project."
4,Cleese in top form,"In this ""In the Wild"" episode, John Cleese ventures to Madagascar to check up on five captive-raised lemurs that were released back into the forest. Along the way, he peppers his explanations and commentary with typical one-liners, just what you'd expect from the Monty Python alum. Anyone who likes Mr. Cleese's style will not be disappointed. Besides the entertainment value, you will learn a thing or two about lemurs, too!Four stars. Highly enjoyable!"
3,Bad Quality?,"I have been a fan of Jorma, Jack, and group for decades. This is my first copy of Burgers, but certainly not the only Tuna in my collection. I am very disappointed in the quality of the CD. The effect is muddy, hard to pick out the clean picking of Jorma. At times Jack's bass totally overpowers in volume, but it is not his usual clean picking. The volume changes moment to moment. I don't think I have ever experienced this level of crappy quality on a non bootleg cd. Have others experienced issue on this, or other CDs? BTW, this is my first review for Amazon."
4,Yet another great album....,"The only reason I rated this a ""4"" is that I personally prefer some of their other efforts a little bit more than this one. That said, ""Burgers"" is truly a great album that any rock/blues fan will enjoy...."
4,Hot Tuna's Finest!,"'Burgers' was the first Tuna album I bought in 1972. For me it was an earthshaking album, mostly because of the excellent picking of Jorma, the superb bass playing of Jack and the 'violin extraordinaire' of Papa John. And let's not forget the beautiful songs! Songs like 'Sea Child', 'Water Song' and the extraordinary rendition of the song '99 Year Blues', which was composed and recorded by Julius Daniels in 1927!Thirty years later I still think 'Burgers' is an outstanding album!"
2,Surprisingly Unfunny...,"I heard great things about Barbershop 2. The first is alright, but this movie starts nowhere and goes nowhere.The only good character is really Cedric, and they show alot of him through flashbacks(just like Memento). As for the others, they aren't anything special. I didn't laugh at any of the commercials and this movie didn't make me laugh once. The only real saving grace is that they did not choose annoying actors for the lead rolls.I would call this movie a cash-in, but that's not what this is. This movie is simply not well done, and isn't funny."
3,The sequel didn't have the bite of the original.,The original had much more edge to it. The characters in part 2 seemed to be holding back. I enjoyed the banter in the female salon much more than the male barbershop. The movie should have exploited a truism - that most men prefer a spartan barbershop to a salon anyday. It's the last place on earth where they can feel like men. NAPPY CUTZ didn't have a chance!
4,Funny movie,This movie is really funny. The actors did a great job. A lot of scenes in this movie are really funny. Good date movie.
2,Very Average,"This movie is nothing special, Barbershop 1 was way better. Don't get me wrong i mean u can easily sit through it. I guess it is pretty stupid to do a sequel on a hairdressing salon. Throughout the movie ice cube is like oh no another salon has opened (nappy cutz in which gina (queen latifah) works. The movie has like 2 funny moments in it. Sequels should be left to people who do interesting horror films (I know what u did last summer, scream (1,2+3)... The point is don't buy this DVD, just rent it."
2,MORE OF THE SAME,"Nothing special about this movie. Maybe this is the cutting room material removed from the floor during Barbershop 1. The new high-tech spa style barbershop storyline wasn't that great. I was more interested in old man Eddie's flashbacks and a woman from his past. When Eddie finally ran into the mystery woman after 30 or 40 yrs later at the subway/train/loop, the directors didn't take the story any further. Maybe the writers and directors will make Barbershop 3...I hope not. Please don't buy this, rent it."
4,Good,"The first one was better and more funnier. If you like African-American comedy, you will like this movieI would recommend this product. I have already bought 3."
5,Barbershop 2: Back in Business (Special Edition),I love BarberShop so I decided to by the sequel. Not as funny as the first but still a great movie.
4,barbershop 2,this movie was a great movie. but it isn't nothing like the first one. but this movie has alot of hot girls.
1,what acting,Why am I going to waste my time listening to these loudmouths. I can go to any clinic to hear it. The only good actor in the movie was Tom Cruise.
3,Southside repeats itself,"I have lived on the Chicago southside, so it is fun to see the streets and the people portrayed. But why did they have to rerun the plot of the first one? It's basically the same choice: Do I sell out and take the money or do I stick with the neighborhood. Guess which decision he makes.It does has some funny moments, but they are mixed in with several plot lines that don't really relate to the movie - a love-hate romance with two of the younger barbers, Cedric the Entertainer reminiscing about his past (We never did find out why his girl left) and the white guy barber's pompous attitude.Overall, I finished watching that movie and thought. Hm. I really could have found something better to do for 2 hours."
4,Barbershop back in business...,Barbershop 2 is a great movie but not quite as funny as the first. This movie is quite a bit more serious. This one showcases Calvin's personal life and delves into his past. And his fathers relationship with Cedric's role. One such thing is you find out how Cedric got hired and you find out he had a love! You also see how competition gets in the way of the Barbershop. This show introduced us to Queen and her upcoming role in The Beautyshop.Over-all this movie is good because it held its ground compared to most sequels. I also like the fact that it is still clean movie. I recommend seeing this movie if you liked the first one.
3,Funnier than the first,"No surprises here storywise but likable just the same. Most of the fun is provided by Cedric the Entertainer. Let's face it. He's crazy. This movie provides a look at the past and how Eddy (Cedric) came to work at the shop and the love of his life. Frankly, I can do without the secondary story. I also get no thrill from Queen Latifah's role in the beauty shop next door. Her role only serves to promote the upcoming movie, Beauty Shop. Still, this is a pleasant enough film to watch when you're in the mood. For those who are starved for black comedy entertainment, here it is."
3,MILDLY AMUSING SOCIAL BARBS LACK THE EDGY MAGIC OF THE FIRST,"As sequels usually go, it's not exactly brave in the tack it takes, but does maintain a general rhythm.The theme itself summarizes the quality of the entire film. A competing company run by suits is opening a clip-shop across the street with bikini-clad damsels doing the hair cutting. Hmm.Cedric the owner is clearly the focal point here but he slurs his lines pretty badly, or it was perhaps the accent, that I had a tough time keeping up with all the supposed humor. What I did understand had little to do with the politically charged wit in the first film, and more to do with ad hominem takes on celebrities.Well paced but hackneyed, just doesn't have the riotous antics as its prequel. Perhaps a decent rental to have as a backdrop for an evening with friends."
2,Ugh,First barbershop was terrific. This one lacks everything the first one had. It seems as though all they did was take every famous black actor and throw them together in a movie along with a crappy script and b movie quality storyline. Dont waste your time unless youre that big a fan of Ice cube or Cedric.
5,funny and more funny,"if you looking for a lot of laughter, get this movie it's funny as hell. and also have alot of top actors and comedians."
5,*CUBE* Does It Again For The 2nd Time Around,"I love this movie. It had a great story line. The acting was great.I like the fact that it used, the very same cast members from Part 1.Also if you are aware of, what really happens in a barber shop then you can relate to this movie. It's really FUNNY!!!!"
1,Really Awful,"The 2 previous reviewers must live in a parallel universe to me. Now I must admit that I had to give up reading half way through the book, I just couldn't take it anymore. I am a huge sci fi fan and read a large number of books every year, and it is fairly rare for me not to be able to finish a book. It started out boring on page 1, and went down hill from there. If it wasn't for the little story blurb on Amazon I probably wouldn't even know what was going on at all in the story. Maybe it got better in the second half, but even the Supreme Court would consider it cruel and inhuman punishment to make someone read it to get there. I really can't give you an intellectual analysis of the book, because I have no idea where it began of where it was going."
5,the start of something special.,"I cannot believe i'm writting about this cartoon series specially since i tend to review music, but some things are worth the effort so here it goes. The spongebob series was pretty cool right from the 1st episodes in '99 up until 2005. The series remained pretty entertaining right up until the producers decided to change spongebob's voice a bit with an almost twisted gay version which coincidentally, stirred up some controversy of whether the producers were attempting to bring spongebob out of the closet. Quite frankly, such matters don't concern me at all. But i'd say that spongebob was special only from '99 to '05. After that, the cartoon lost its luster and creative roots."

4,I never saw this coming,"If you didn't know how popular Spongebob is than this is definite proof. The first ever Nick Toon to receive a complete Season 1 DVD release. This is almost unheard of in the world of 12 minute shorts made for children the age 5 and over. Unlike all the other Nick Toons Spongebob has hit a chord that hasn't been struck since the likes of Ren and Stimpy have graced our television sets. Its a shame we all bought the past releases thinking ""well this is as good as it gets."" I never saw this coming I am both shocked and happily surprised. Sure I feel ripped off, but I'm glad I can get all the episodes now. Those ten per episode discs were boggling my mind with no end as to how would I own them all?Just release all three seasons within a reasonable time span and one day I will completely forgive them for misleading us with the single disc releases. Can't wait for the movie.All hail the magic conch!! blurlwowhwowoww!!!"
3,Complete? I think not.....,"I purchased this DVD collection because of my love of Spongebob. This collection is only the first season so there are episodes on the individual releases that are not on this one. However, this collection is not 'complete'. The pilot episode 'Help Wanted' was left out. The pilot episode shows where spongebob gets ready to apply for his job at the Krusty Krab. Then has to prove himself, as the great fry cook he is, by preparing krabby patties for a mass of customers. I'm not sure how you could call it complete w/out it. The missing episode was the only disappointing factor of this set. I am a huge fan of Spongebob as are my kids!!"
5,Spongebob is the best!,Every since this hit tv show came out on Nickelodeon in 1999 I have been asking myself for more spongebob. I finally get it with the first season of spongebob. I am fifteen and I love spongebob. I watch it on TV all the time. I will never get tired of it. If you want a good quality show buy Spongebob Squarepants: The Complete First Season. I hope for Season 2 and 3 will come out pretty soon!
5,Sponge-boy-me-bob,I'm trying to get every season as this is my favorite cartoon.It's great to see the original episodes again.
3,ok,"It was ok. If you collect spongebob dvds then you should get this. It has 16 episodes that have not been on recent dvds. The lines are thicker,the episodes don't look as good as newer episodes,and the plots are'nt as well thought as they are on the newer episodes.This box set contains 3 discs.It has 40 episodes and over 90 minutes of special fetures.If you collect spongebob dvds like I do,you should get this dvd. It has some pretty good episodes.This dvd is ok,even though the newer episodes are better."
1,Readily absorbed,"You can use a sponge to wipe up a mess, andwhat a mess a sponge can become. Some utterlyfilthy sponges expel their filth on unsuspectingchildren and parents.Speaking of parents, where are the parentsof Spongeboob Loosepants and Patlick? They seemfar too young to be living on their own. Perhapstheir burning desire for each other didn't sittoo well with their unaccepting parents. I'm simplyspeculating... maybe their folks just threw inthe sponge.WARNING: Spongeboob used in conjunction with WaltDisney films may produce nearly irreversiblepsychological damage.Pirates love booty."
5,AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME!!! I have been waiting and waiting and waiting for somthing like this to come out and finaly FINALY it did. The first season (my personal fav.) is absolutly great!I cant wait to get this and i will as soon as it comes out. To see whats on the Dvd look at other ppls reviews. AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME. Clunk *falls down dead*
3,it's just missing something.....,"spongebob is great, but if this is the complete season 1, then why is Help Wanted left out?"
4,Warning!,"Beware! This DVD set is very good... if we don't consider the fact that it doesn't have the ""Help Wanted!"" episode. I actually was disappointed by that, because if you are told that this is the COMPLETE 1st Season, then you expect all the Season 1 episodes to be here, especially the first one. However, you can find this episode in the Complete 3rd Season DVD set. So, no worries."
4,"Good, But 2nd and 3rd Seasons Will Be Better","So here we have Spongebob, the greatest cartoon since Looney Toons putting out it's first season box set. Now I don't own this product, but I can rate it based on episodes. Spongebobs first season was it's worst season. It wasn't bad. It produced classics such as 'Opposite Day', 'Musclebob Buffpants', and 'Hall Moniter'. This goes to show you how good this show is, if classics like this came from the show at it's worst years. However, there are indeed more bad episodes from season 1 than any other season. Like 'The Chaperone', which was the worst Spongebob ever. Also, 'Reef Blowers', which was just a short film.and many of the very early first seasons weren't very good. I'd suggest you wait ofr the 2nd and 3rd seasons, which were both better than the 1st season, to come out, still, I am impressed overall by the episode llineup and recommend it."
4,Not exactly the entire first season.,"Being a Spongebob fanatic I was excited about the season one release. I rated it 4 out 5 stars, because it seems that they have left out one episode. ""Help wanted"" is no where to be found on the dvd's. It's not even listed on the back. Maybe they will come out with the ""Absolutely Complete Spongebob Squarepants Season 1 DvD"". After all they did release all those other compilations first. If anyone finds the missing episode as an easter egg please post here"
1,Oh Tartar Sauce!,"Where is Help Wanted? How can this be the ""complete"" first season without this episode? The Spongebob fan in our house is really disappointed."
4,What gives?,"Has anyone noticed besides me that 1 episode is missing from the set? At least on my DVDs, ""Help Wanted"" was omitted. Why?"
3,I like it but theres 1 flaw 2 it all,I got this about 2 years ago when i watched it i noticed on amazon.com they listed 'neptunes spatula' & 'help wanted' but mine didnt have those 2 & those were some of my favs whats the matter with some things that people buy???? & why me!?!?!?!?!?!?!!!!!?????
5,Great! First Season a classic.,"Come and join Spongebob and Pals as the live the underwater life in this amazing first season of Spongebob Squarepants. Enjoy great episodes like the Reef Blower, and a favorite of mine: ""Ripped Pants"" Soon you'll be screaming ""I'M READY, I'M READY"" like your favorite cartoon character."
4,help wanted,"I rented Disc 1 of this set from Netflix and it had the pilot episode ""Help Wanted"" on it. Then strangely I bought the set, and it's not on there. I wonder why this is? Maybe after making a few dvd's they got into a squabble on royalties with the Tiny Tim camp for the use of his song. Anyways, be aware that 'Help Wanted' is not on newer versions of this set."
5,spongetized,the best dvd ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but the only episode that it doesnt include is HELP WANTED but its still the best its around 8hours of entertainment
1,Ripped pants? No. I think we're RIPPED OFF!!,"What a waste of money. Why, nick, why? Okay, so, first you advertise all the spongebob dvds with 8 episodes, then you reduce the number to 6 episodes per dvd, then you start putting episodes already on dvds on new ones then you bring out this. You @$$ holes. I think people should sue Nickelodeon for not getting the proper WRITTEN PERMISSION to use the song in Help Wanted. Oh, yes its on at least once every month. Doesn't this mean that nickelodeon has broken the law? I'm no lawyer, but, Nick, i tell you, breaking the law has bad consequences."
5,Sticky rice bamboo hat & spittoon,"This item is everything that I was hoping it would be. I need a little more practice in perfecting my rice making technique, though. All in all, it is what I was hoping for and expecting. I would recommend these items to anyone interested in this item."
3,Enjoyable but needed more developed characters.,"Stumbled upon this gem because of the film adaptation with Felicity Jones. I always try to read the book before seeing the film so I hunted down a copy. It is surprisingly difficult to get ahold of this but it was worth it. An enjoyable fluffy story, fun to read on a rainy day or on the beach. The characters a whimsical treat. More character development should have been done, though.If you can acquire a copy, do so. However, make sure you go in knowing that they're sparse characters and with that mindset, the novella is a real pleasure."
1,Total waste of time,"Not one person (except, perhaps the groom) in this book has any redeeming qualities.""Heroine"" is a self-involved, insipid child.""Hero"" is worse.This book was a total waste of time. Had it been longer, I would have stopped reading all together."
3,Helpful but incomplete,"Christie Cozad Neuger has written a book that is very helpful in understanding women that come from oppressed environments. The book seems to be written as if all women are oppressed and do not have voice. I do not believe that this is so, and found the recurring opinion of how oppresed women are to be a bit tedious. It does explain some of the details of what narrative therapy is, but it is lacking in case studies to explain how to acutally apply narrative therapy. This book is very helpful in assiting one to offer care to oppressed women, but the narrative therapy portion will have to be supplemented by other readings."
2,Looks awesome but not functional in water. :(,"This aquarium decor is really beautiful and looks great but, after only 2 weeks in our aquarium, it started to flake & chip! The bubbles flow through the middle of the columns & looks awesome. I am very unhappy with it considering how much I really liked it when I first added it to my tank. Unfortunately, it is not functional in the water with the paint rubbing off & chipping. When I pushed on the white chipped sections, the material under the paint is soft and easy to scrape off with your nails. I think it is plaster! I was afraid that it could have hurt my fish."
5,NIce,"The measurements they give are a little off, its about 13'' in height and its 10"" in diameter. Great addition to a tank, make sure your tank is big enough, at least 40 gal."
4,Looking at The Moon,Great book for identifing craters on the Moon. Very LARGE SIZE book. Much to large for normal book shelves in the home. I recommend this book for the information available.
5,Stunning Pictures,"I liked it. It has stunning photos. I am not an amateur astronomer and I have not compared this book to any others in this category. I used it as bathroom reading, because I could read one page at a time. I was looking for a good place for a small hotel. I like Theophilus, because it is a deep crater near the equator."
5,An essential guide to New England,"If you are going to take a tour of New England this is a must have book. It includes great ideas for touring around Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Connecticut. If you are only going to Boston you are probably better off buying the cheaper Boston guide but any tour of New England needs this book. The pictures are great and as always the division by region is a great way to see things. Whether you are touring the whole thing or just a few states this book is an excellent start."
3,New England Travel,"I bought this book for a New England Cruise. The entire book was too much for the four cities that we visited, but would have been good if we'd been traveling by car. Unfortunately, New England is fairly large to be covered in one book. Boston is covered well, but compared to the book that I already had on Boston it didn't have all the details that I would have wanted for more than a one-to-two day visit. Descriptions of the cities were pretty good, but places to stay and places to eat were very lacking."
1,"A shallow, erroneous reading by a fundamentalist","Lewis' interpretation of Satan makes absolutely no sense to anyone who knows the poem - until, that is, you realize that Lewis really believes in the devil and can't stomach the idea of a book that makes him into a hero."
5,Introduction to Milton's epic poem,"This book was a pleasure to read both before and after reading PARADISE LOST. In fact, one can make a nice trilogy out of PREFACE TO PARADISE LOST, PARADISE LOST, and Lewis's PERELANDRA. Lewis's PREFACE should interest both the general reader and the specialist. Lewis gives a roadmap for working through Milton's epic poem, discussing what an epic is and why Milton chose it, for example, or why Milton used a certain style for writing; he also comments on Milton's theology, medieval hierarchy, and a number of other pertinent subjects with which the reader will probably not be overly familiar. The writing is clear, the discussion lucid and enlightening, and the subjects are interesting. This is certainly worth purchasing."
5,All of Midsomers Murders,"I have been a great fan of Midsomer Murders, and with all of its cast. The cast are just great even the ones who are no longer on the show. I miss Gavin (character ) but those that have replaced him are just as great. Joyce and Cully (mother and daughter) are excellent. And Tom (DCI)I wish he really wait to retire at least wait until he becomes a grandfather. We will be waiting, I can sit down with my grandchildren and watch the show without telling them to leave the room or fast forwarding to keep them from hearing foul language. I have purchase every DVD and have no complaint.I can continue to watch you all until I am 66 or more."
2,Not the best of Midsomer,"I can understand why this isn't the most popular season of Midsomer Murders (Season 16). Dont get me wrong, I am a huge fan of Midsomer Murders, but Season 16 was just not up to par with earlier or later episodes. I don't know if they were just goofy scripts, or if John Nettles was looking forward to retiring from the series, but the stories didnt seem that interesting and the interaction between Banaby and Jones was uncomfortable and somehow felt out of place. The next two series are much better and I am looking forward to Season 19 when it is released in February."
2,midsomer murders - set 16,"I have enjoyed the Midsomer Murders series through tv and now DVD's since the series began.. I have never had anything to say that wasn't full of praise. Acting superb and plots ingenious. Set 16, however, was a disappointment. The plots were quite wild, the scripts ridiculous, The acting crew was stilted - maybe they weren't happy with the scripts they had to deal with. And the chases - I am critical of American tv because they rely on chases to fill up time. I find them quite boring and sincerely hope that British tv will not follow in the footsteps of the US productions."
2,My last Midsomer Murders Purchase,"Oh my! Contrived plots and, in some cases, just plain bad acting. We are so disappointed in this set. We will continue to enjoy the first 15 sets but won't be adding to our collection."
1,Skip this set.,"I think a film school dropout directed and edited these shows... ""Midsomer Life"" for me, is unwatchable... the camera doesn't stay on the subject for more than a second or two... before flashing to another subject... I would think this kind of editing would be very expensive... cut here... cut there... cut cut cut.Sad because, I really loved this series."
4,Good price No pockets,I was thinking it of using it for my tennis. Unfortunately there was no clue saying it dint have pockets. Anyways its a good shorts for great price.
3,It's a guy thing these shiny shorts,"$8.90 was a Friday Sale price which makes it ""better"" than the much nicer adidas shorts that are $20. Assembled in The Dominican Republic from U.S. components."
5,Roomy,My boyfriend says that these are his favorite shorts. Nice and roomy with some breathing room.
1,Poor review,"Poor review...see UPCI.org for better info. The oneness view , according to Jesus in Mark 12:29, is a legitimate Jewish belief that God is simply the One and only God!"
5,Thanks Terry R Nye and others,i received this product and it contained easy to follow instructions. I assume the clarity of the instructions were due to the terrific and constructive criticism found among these reviews. Even a fumble fingered aging dolt like me had the revolver up and running in a matter of minutes. In the right light I can now mow down the broadsides of barns with relentless precision. A decided improvement over the original sights as has been attested to by better reviewers and better shots than me. Thanks Guys!
5,GP100 HiViz Front Sight,"I've been firing the Ruger GP100 with the factory provided front sights for over 15 years. As both a gunsmith and firearms instructor I must admit that the HiViz front sight insert makes a world of difference. The fiber optic lights up like search beacon and your eyes are automatically drawn exactly where they should be; to the front sight! You pick up the sights quicker, you pick up the target quicker, and consequently your rounds are down range faster and more accurately, as long as you do your part behind the gun. Al the light bars work well, but I chose the red fiber optic on mine. Installation was under 10 seconds and unless you use your gun as substitute for a hammer they should last various lifetimes. They work, they're easy to install, and they are inexpensive; What's not to like?"
5,Target Aquired,"Like night and day between the original factory front sight on my Ruger GP-100 and the HiViz. Worth every cent. Installation was no problem, 2 minutes max. Even with twilight light levels it can still be seen, far better than factory sight. Don't hesitate."
5,Fit perfectly,"This was an excellent value and fit my GP100 revolver perfectly. Very easy to install and to change colored tubes. It really shows up well, much better to sight in than original black sight. Recommend it."
5,Great Visibility,I put this on a RugerGP100 and it is great. Also comes with additional color fiber optics to replace depending on your shooting light condition. Some colors work better than others in different lighting conditions. You won't be disappointed.
3,Much Blood,"Not enough story. This was a very cheap ripe off of Alien. It was goofy, with a decent looking monster. Actually it kinda looked like a big uncut penis. W/ teeth! Alot of blood and dumb blondes made this a true classic in B movie heaven. With a supposedly twist ending, could have had a sequel. But I don't think it did."
3,"little suspence, good effects.","Like ""The fly"" and ""aliens"", the special FX in this are exellent.their is obviously alot of time and Creativity put into the FX.But, the script, and the actinng, on the other hand, are not that good, witch make it feel a bit fun to watch. If you have an hour or so to kill, give this one a try, or, rent one of the other bigger budget movies that managed to do it with more money and alot more intrest. Worth a look, i guess.............."
2,Its red not purple and the pants are included.,"This costume looks nothing like the picture. The vest is red not purple, my son was devestated. The bat embleishment at the neck is not there, but as an upside, the pants are included. I would have to say, this is a poorly put together costume and Im pretty disappionted in it. I ordered another vampire costume for my older son that was cheaper and is wayyy nicer, and it was supposed to be red. Now I have a cheap red costume and a very nice one... not going to go over well with the kids. Not Happy with this purchase at all."
2,Not as shown,"The vest is RED not purple as pictured. My son loves purple and that is the reason I picked this vampire costume over others that are better quality. The rest is ok, and not best quality but for the low cost, what would you expect. Still, the item should be what appears in the picture."
1,Black ink cartridges for Epson printer,"These cartridges were advertised to work on Epson Stylus CX5400, but do not work in my printer. I am returning package."
2,Doesn't Work with my Printer,The ink cartridges I received are not compatible with my printer even though the product description states that it is compatible with an Epson Sylus 82.
1,Missing a solid basis of appreciation for truth,"I really WANTED to like this book. Being aware of the sacramental nature of our life in Christ is something I've spent a lot of time thinking about. Unfortunately, this book feels ""off"", slightly tainted with an overemphasis on story and a lack of appreciation for solid truth. Yes, the story of Jesus matters, and people's individual stories matter...but they don't matter more than or at the expense of the truth of the creeds. Both are necessary, and unfortunately the Vogels seem to have forgotten that."
5,"Excellent, and I want more.","This is a great CD. Does anyone know the name of the new thing I saw on BET? It was a piece where the guys were bouncing basketballs like Stomp, along with Afrika Bambaata, and I didn't catch the title. I just want more of this great stuff."
5,Images of a by-gone era,"I stumbled across this book almost 10 years ago and it was like reliving an old dream. Incredible! This book will take you on a ride through the 5 boroughs of NYC and the graffiti that embraced her during the 70's and 80's. This ""bible"" of sorts has helped preserve images that are no longer in existence."
5,BRONX GRAFFITI WRITERS UNITED AGAIN !!!,"Wow, this book just took me back to my days in the Bronx and the 2 line.All the greats are in this one..Doing those T and B's and hitting the yards, and dodging the DT's Now those were the great days of the BRONX.Long liveMIKE170..TAV 1..ALE..AJAX..SUPER SEX..BLADE..COMET..FUZZ..POPEYE..MIKE 170...."
5,Truly Awesome.,"This book is truly awesome. I read it from cover to cover the night i got it. I have been looking for something like this for a long time, and will keep it forever."
4,awesome,this dvd was great i loved it forgot how bad autum was and ben what a jerk if he was working at a restrurant i went to i would walk out
4,"For fans, but not the best season","The right person wins but getting there is torture. This crew had very few stand outs. Ben gets my vote for most annoying contestant ever, what surprised me was how few people commented on his whiney egotism throughout. I guess he made a good foil for the person who eventually won."
3,Great ride but ultimately disappointing.,"Halfway through this season I found myself thinking that none of the competitors were anywhere near Gordon Ramsey Executive Chef caliber. One guy seemed close, but I honestly wondered, ""How is Ramsay going to deal with this?"". Well, the winner just seemed to come out of nowhere and exhibited nothing more than really solid line-cooking skills. Not surprisingly, the winner ended up not getting the gig after all. After watching the finale, I went back to episode one to review the 'signature dish' challenge. The winner's dish was a pathetic, misguided, clumsy mess. How does one go from that, to the stellar winning dishes that come out later? I expect a little bit of 'fakeness', but man, this season really bummed me out."
5,Its great!,"I would recommend this site for any dvd season purchase. They find what you need, and it arrives exactly when promised."
3,"Good, but not the best","The album is good, but not the best offering by The Pogues. For a first time buyer, go for the earlier albums. The Pogues produced this album after the lead singer (who wrote most of the music) was kicked out of the band for being a stinking drunk. The music on this album doesn't have the variety of previous albums."
2,The worst of the best.,"If I had never heard the Pogues prior to this release, this might rate a 3 or a 4, but the songs lack the power and unique vision of the '84-'90 releases. These songs are enjoyable, expertly performed, and melodic. You won't be disappointed...that is unless you've heard the Pogues' previous work."
3,Is this the Hoppy I knew?,"Rather than feel as though I was reading a novel, this felt more like I was reading three or four short stories -- episodes in the life of a young Hopalong Cassidy. This is NOT the Hoppy of TV serialized form -- and that's all right, too, as long as it wasn't your expectation that it would be (but I thought I'd find someone like Mr. Boyd in there somewhere)."
1,I was bored,did not finish the book .that said there isn't much more to write about it .I won't be reading any more of Mulford's books
2,Ok but a bit slow,"Several assorted stories of the West with characters pretty well developed, but for me some of the extended dialog and character development, well for me it diluted the action a bit too mcy. I kept reading, faster and less relaxed hoping to get to more action for all the development that was going on, but it just missed the mark for me. I would not say don't read it, but I would say you might need to be more patient then I am."
5,Couldn't put it down,A good read. Truly enjoyed and hard to put down.I believe I read it in two nights. And it's free on Kindle!!
4,Good Western,I have read most of Louis L'Amore's books and he would reference this author and these books in some of his novels. I gave them a try and found them to be a good read with good story lines. I would recommend these books to other western fans!!
4,A Cowboy's good read!,"Pretty good. Good insight to life of the past. How a working Cowboy has evlolved in this country.Some good, some corruption at times."
1,"Boring, with a generous portion of Oaken-cheese","I should have known better. Plain and simple, the tracks on this CD are either very boring and/or very cheesy. (with the exception of Ogenki Clinic's ""First Light"" - and he makes you wait til the end of the first CD to hear it!) Max Graham's own ""Tell You"" is the cheesiest thing I've heard since Perfecto's ""Bullet In a Gun"" - which is PRECISELY where I stopped listening to Paul Oakenfold! Go buy Sander Kleinenberg's ""Nu Breed"" or Hooj's ""New Progressive Era"". Those CD'S are way cool and dairy free! And by the way, Max Graham, this is exactly why some DJ's are starting to play ""too deep""."
1,Horrible - I wasted my money,I went on a spree a couple of weeks ago - buying a couple dozen trance/progressive CDs. This was the worst of the lot. Max is another boring Oakenfold/Sasha wannabe; not a speck of interest here. I remember just missing his set a a big outdoor party near Toronto about a year ago - thank GOD! Enough already.
2,I hate trance,"It takes a REALLY good DJ like John Digweed to make Trance listenable. From what I've heard about Max Graham, I'd have thought he could do better than this. Two CDs of pure boring trance drivel. The tracklist grabbed me because he rounds out disc 2 with Underworld's unbelievable ""Kittens."" However, it embarrassingly crushes the tracks on either side of it (and everything else in the set). You'd be better off just getting UW's Beaucoup Fish, which contains the exact same version of ""Kittens"" in all its glory, without crappy tracks blended into it. If you are looking for superb progressive trance, go get Digweed's Global Underground Los Angeles. Both discs are the BOMB. Seriously."
3,Smooth But Uninspiring,"Not to diminsh the quality of this set in any way, I found this outing by Max Grahm to be smooth but entirely uninspiring. The measures go long on technique - indeed the mixing is probably the most flawless of transitions anywhere - but Transport 4 never really builds, and never really dives. Then again, I'm more Dyke/Pearce/System F Gatecrasher style, so I found Transport 4 far too mellow for my preference. This is safe mixing without risk."
5,A rare album worth its praise.,I have yet to find another release that captures the soul and spirit that is trance like Transport 4. Max Graham is somehow able to take tracks from all parts of the trance world and arrange them as if they were meant to be one. The production is seamless and the effect truly spiritual. A definite must buy release. Highly recommended.
3,"Max is an Artist, But Bring on the Beat Man!!","Wow, this stuff is deep!! This also brings up a problem. If you are into the Deep, Dark, Heavy ""House"", then more power to ya'. But if you want uplifting, fast, hard sounds and beats, this isn't for you. I have a hard time with the beginning and end of this 2 disc set. It takes Max f.o.r.e.v.e.r to take off and use those great beats I've heard from him!! Then he keeps the beat pretty steady for about 2 tracks, then lets it fall into that Deep, Dark stuff again! I wouldn't have even given this CD 3 stars, but hey, it's Max Graham!"
1,Very generic and forgettable,"As someone who listens primarily to electronica and thinks Max Graham has produced some excellent remixes/tracks, I thought I would love this album. Unfortunately I would characterize most selections as boring, uncreative, and forgettable. Sure there are a few neat tracks, like the slickly produced and slightly sinister remix of Conjure One's Redemption, but there is not enough material here for one CD, let alone two.This album is not recommended unless you desire some background music that does not draw your attention."
4,ultimate nighttime summer driving music.,"nothing else to say but just pop it in, move up the bass and treble, and find yourself a nice stretch of blacktop that runs along the water. trust me. don't forget, best tracks are TELL YOU from Disc 1, and CONJURE ONE - REDEMPTION (Max Graham Dead Sea Mix) from Disc 2. Buy it, add Hybrid and Underworld to that, and you can't go wrong!"
5,"This mix is TIMELESS, DEEP, and full of ENERGY","If you like deep groovy slamming house and trance that's impeccably mixed, get this CD please! I own hundreds of electronic music mixes and this is easily one of my TOP 10 favorites. The track selection is just outstanding, and even years later I'm impressed by the production quality of each and every track. Well done Max."
4,perhaps pay no mind...,"to reviews written about a true progressive house cd by people who profess their love for ""eurotrance"" and dj tiesto.^^^^^^both discs of transport are superb, with disc one being the standout for me. excellently programmed,as was mentioned in a review above, with clearly audible highs and lows, with the hilite of the disc being the excellent blackwatch mix of strange world. disc 2 is a little more representative of a live set in a club,and as such,is more banging. flawless mixing,as on the 1st disc, but,IMHO, the 1st disc is more of a finely tuned journey."
5,Powerful low-cost web site tool,"Wow! I have been using the trial version of Namo WebEditor 5.5 for about a week, and I am astounded by the amount of functionality this program has, including code-cleanup, CSS, layers, PHP/JSP/ASP database access, and a vector graphics editor to name some of the more interesting features. The only big feature missing is templates. Almost as good as Dreamweaver & Fireworks together. This is an excellent low-cost solution to web development (even for someone like myself who usually likes to do it by hand). If you need an inexpensive web creation tool, download the trial version of this software. I think you'll be very pleased."
5,Money Saving Info,"If you're interested in NAMO WebEditor 5.5, consider that Namo is offering a free upgrade to WebEditor 5.5 to those that have purchased 5.0. The upgrade comes in the form of a downloadable patch available on the Namo web page. Go to: www.namo.com/products/webeditor/Save some money. I suggest buying 5.0 and upgrading, since it is a little cheaper than buying 5.5 outright."
1,Bad Customer Service,"Aside from the fact that this program is full of bugs (for example, you create a page, then view it in preview and it comes out all scrambled up), Namo's customer service is non-existent. They have an alleged registered user's forum on their site, but the software won't allow you to type in a question--and when I tried *on several occasions* to point this out and to get my questions answered from Namo customer service and technical support, I got no response. Nothing.Don't waste your money. Find another product."
1,Pure & Total JUNK!,"This program is waste!! I created my website with this, and it took me almost 3 months because this program wouldn't work properly..(At all!), and would blow me out of it if I just tried to save something. Nothing worked! If I needed to just publish an edited page to my website, supposedly, you can just select to publish the edited pages. Well, when I tried doing that, it blew me out of the program. So, I tried to psychronize the pages. Well, when I tried doing that, it blew me out of the program again. So, I had to publish the entire thing all over again, just to get one page updated. At 99%, it blew me out again, and of course no changes were made on the site!! Total junk, total joke, TOTAL WASTE OF TIME & MONEY!!"
2,You get what you pay for.,"In short, you get what you pay for. Although inexpensive, webEditor isn't quite the deal it is made out to be. It is neither intuitive nor consistent with the usability of other publishing applications like Front Page, Publisher, or GoLive. While I didn't use all its features, it does appear quite powerful. But for more basic page designs, it is excessively time consuming to use. I highly recommend downloading the trial version to use before purchasing. It helped me decide not to buy it."
3,"Considering that this is Too Short, I thought this was a sub-par ""Greatest Hits""","There should have been more hits... I mean this is Short Dawg!! About 40% of the songs were Hot To Me! But, you be the judge! Definitely worth $3.00, nothing over $5, including shipping..."
2,Somethins wrong must not be real Too Short songs !!!,"Yes this CD has some hits but it does not even begin to caputure whats really real about Too Short. He is the man and I know his greatest hits/808's are not found here. Quit playin!!! you are misleading young listeners forealdoe!! If you want to know about Too Short get at least the first six CD's they are straight ""old school gangster ride"" you'll love them. Too Short is rap!!!"
3,could have been better,"its a ok cd, has some good songs but not all. its not the too short we have come to know and listen too."
5,Beautiful illustrations,"My three year old son is an entranced with this book as I am. The illustrations are beautiful and the story really attracts the attention of young children. I think any child, whether or not they have a pet cat, would be really intrigued with this book."
2,"this is not the ""I Am"" documentary from the Oprah Show","Oprah did a piece on Tom Shadyac's I Am which I was immediately interested in. I purchased this DVD thinking it was one in the same, but it clearly was not. This I Am was poorly scripted, poorly acted and, frankly not particularly relatable. I do applaud the effort to begin a dialog regarding this topic and hope it gets people thinking about their lives."
2,"Looks like an A movie, but the plot is obvious","The quality of the film is good. It looks like you would expect a movie to look like these days. The plot however was fairly obvious; it's likened to the plot line of the movie ""Crash"" where people are related based on a series of events both past and present. The movie started out by relating to events that was 1 year earlier so It's understandable that the main protagonist was reflecting. However as the other characters started reflecting also (i.e. within the reflection of the main protagonist) it was very hard to keep track of what was present day and what was in the past, and past past. Character development was terrible, and some of the acting seemed unnatural. I should have lowered my expectations before looking at the film, however so this review is most likely biased. Perhaps watching too many secular films has sullied my option."
2,NOT MY KIND OF MOVIE....,"I RENTED THIS MOVIE FROM ""RENT-24 HR ON DEMAND"" AND WAS READY TO SHUT IT OFF WITHIN A FEW MINUTES BUT I WATCHED ABOUT 45 MINS OF IT (TO GIVE IT A SECOND CHANCE). I found this movie way too preachy to be a ""storytelling"" venture. The script seemed WEEKLY-TV-series type drama. There is little for the audience to interpret; the interpretation has already been done and the purpose and point of the movie is already known and outlined. I thought the acting was soap-opera like the script.I did not enjoy this movie at all.And, I didn't like the too-dark download and the bad audio.I will approach Amazon for a refund.--MO"
3,An Ok movie,"I thought it was actually pretty good. It might have been better if it was downsized a bit and had some more action sequences, but it was thought provoking. I might show it to the church."
2,I got the wrong film,I also made the same mistake. I typed in the search for Tom Shadyac's film and I thought this was it. I hate returning things so I watched it. Oh well.
2,Read & Re-read before ordering items !,"I also mistakingly ordered this dvd thinking I was ordering the documentary ""I AM"" from the Oprah show. Sadly, this dvd is a repeat of the ""fear-based"" message of Christian dvd's.....far removed from the essence of spirituality & love in Tom Shadyac's message of enlightenment."
1,Mistaken Identity!,"Terrible! This movie is not the same ""I Am"" as the one that was produced by Tom Shadyac (as seen on Oprah). The one by Shadyac is not yet available everywhere. Amazon will notify you when it becomes available, if you sign up for the alert notification."
1,Not what I thought it was....,"Thought I was ordering Tom Shadyac's version of I Am. Searched it and was taken to a page that apepared to be what I wanted. It wasn't. Many others have done the same thing. This may have been a good movie, I don't know. I returned it becuase I ordered the wrong thing. I think I ordered the wrong thing, in part, to how these were presented on the website."
1,Bad Deal,Too bad I didnt pay better attention to what I was buying.Guess I will next time. Thought this was the one Oprah hadon her show. Cant really give it any stars/guess I had to. Didnt even watchit when I realized it wasnt the movie I wanted.
5,A wonderful book that creates its own amnesia!,"I love this book, and am on my 3rd time reading it. I pick it up whenever I get too stressed out and need an ""amnesia experiment"" of my own. The imagary in this book is fantastic! By the time I'm done reading one page I feel de-stressed. Van Arsdale takes me with her on her literary journey to that little island near Canada. I feel as if I'm there. If you ever need a book that will help take you away from it all, this is the one! I can't wait to read her next book!"
3,This is not gluten free,I bought this thinking the oats in it was gluten free since it said it was only to get very sick and had to go to the hospital only to have the doctors tell me that gluten free oats is not safe for celiacs like me since it still has gluten in it.
4,Great Product,"These fiber smart capsules are really effective and work as advertised. The price is right too, much cheaper than I can purchase locally. I would not hesitate to purchase them again when I run out of my current supply."
1,more like fiberLESS,"I got this product to take along with my total body cleanse because it's made by the same company, and I had heard it is good to get more fiber, especially when detoxing, so as to help absorb the toxins. When I got home, however, after taking fiberSMART for a few days I was looking more closely at the Supplement Facts on the back of the bottle. Truth is this product only contains 1g of fiber per 4 capsules. So even if you take the 12 capsules per day, you're only actually getting 3g of fiber. WTF!? Just eat a slice of bread and you'll get more."
2,Wish I had know just how little fiber is in this product,There are .25g of fiber in one pill and the recommended dose is 4 to 8 pills a day. That is a lot of pills and it only adds up to a whopping 2g of fiber. I took these 8 pills a day for two weeks with no benefit. It was only then I examined the ingredients more carefully. .25g per pill?! Preposterous. This product did not help me to go or to become more regular and at $14 I am more than annoyed that the description did not include the amount of fiber that is actually in the product. If I had read the fiber content on the bottle when it arrived I would have just sent it back. Silly me. I skipped right over it to the other ingredients. If you eat a piece of flax bread and a cup of yogurt every day you will pretty much have achieved what this product does.
5,Charms for the Easy Life,"I am ordering the DVD today. I have the book, and have read it over and over and over, since 1999. It is charming, and wonderful, and even better than reading it, is listening to Kaye Gibbons read it on audio tape. I have worn my tape out listening to it so many times. Kaye's voice makes the characters come alive, and her North Carolinian accent is simply beautiful. If you haven't read the book, get it today! You will fall in love with these 3 women, and Kaye Gibbons style of story-telling!"
4,A beautiful film,"This is a beautiful film about strong people and strong women living their lives how they so choose. This film made me laugh and it made me cry. Watching people enjoy the simple but beautiful pleasures of life is refreshing. These characters never seem too busy to miss the beauty of the world. Whenever I get caught up in life and start to think it is too difficult to stand, films like this make me realize how to make lemons into lemonade. This is a beautiful film that promotes the feminine spirit, love, and the desire to follow one's heart in order to become truly happy in ones life. However, this film goes beyond simple mind candy to waste the afternoon with. It left me inspired about the wonders of life."
3,Not what I was looking for,"If you are into listening to the music and some devotions here and there, than you might like this. I was looking for the audio version of the conferences they hold with their hilarious stories. They always seem to link everything back to God with their stories and I like that. I'm not saying this isn't good, but just not what I was looking for."
4,well I'm sure that they gave it their all,"There ain't much to say it's just the same ol' finntroll blending death metal with hummpa, which sounds like music you would hear in a kid's Disney movie. One problem is that it's short, just under half an hour. Another thing is that the vocalist got on my nerves on some of the songs because his voiced sounded like it was a little worn out. You can hear clear vocals on some parts to some songs just like on Jaktens Tid. There are 2 instrumental pieces using the keyboard and some of the songs kinda have a medievel feel to them. The booklette comes with lyrics and english translations which are hard to read at times because of the background on the page. Overall this is a good finntroll cd and a must have for any fan, no matter the price."
2,Next to useless if you actually want to learn to use VTK,"If you're looking for a book to learn to use VTK, this is practically useless. The language is explained only incidentally, and in very little detail. the book mostly concentrates on computer graphics theory (which is done much better in other books) and visualisation, which it treats fairly well."
1,Hands Off,"This is clearly one of the worst books I've ever seen. I do admit there's lots of detail in there on visualization techniques etc. However, buying a book named ""The Visualization Toolkit"" I expect information about exactly this. Instead, what you get with this book is in-depth coverage of how the marching cubes algorithm works for example. Now let me ask you: Does that information help you using the toolkit? Definitely not. Consequently, if you want a practical guide to using VTK, do NOT consider this one."
3,pretty good,"Unfortunately, I was unable to see all but the last 15 minutes of this video. With what I did see, I saw a great comparison in the compassion for the wrong doers that Prospero had. I think that was excellent. I wish that I could have seen it all though, because by the reaction of my class, it was a pretty good movie."
3,The same or not the same,"As I watched the 1999 version of The Tempest, I found that it was more easy to understand than Shakespeare's play. That reason is because we don't live in that era. This movie is for sure down to earth and more relatable to modern day. The movie did base its story on the play and took the same ideas portrayed by Shakespeare. It was then turned into something that even children could interpret. I feel that the movie did not do the original version justice in the themes brought up. By ""watering it down"", the director took out the full meanings of the play and didn't let the audience's imagination create what Shakespeare may have intended. Overall this film showed good morals but was not as good of quality as a Hollywood film would be. Although, there were some good special effects, in the long run this film will probably be outdone by a future interpretation of the play. But until then, it will help explain what Shakespeare might have written if he were here in the future."
2,Shakespeare wasn't made for T.V.,"I liked this movie,and I agree Miranda is a hottie. I don't feel that this movie did justice to Shakespeare. I mean you take a play written by the greatest writter in history and turn into a made for T.V. movie? Come on, whose Idea was this? I did like the special effects. I wonder what Shakespeare would have done if he were alive today."
3,My Review,I thought that the movie overall was okay. I didn't like how they used slaves in it. I wish they would have encorporated more of what Shakespeare had said in the movie. I thought that the movie left out a lot of parts from the play that I would have liked to see. I thought the movie was much easier to understand and it would have been good to have watched it before I read the play. I feel that most movies based on a book never portray all that is in the book.
1,The Tempest is Trash,The movie The Tempest with Peter Fonda completely failed to display the quality and meaning of Shakespeare's play. The whole mystical feel of Shakespeare's play was lost. The setting of the story made no sense. The actors were terrible and the civil war did not fit in. All in all I wouldn't ever recomend this movie to anyone. To put anyone through that torture is cruel and unusually punishment. If you want a good and meaningfull story read Shakespeare's play.
3,The Tempest,"I thought that this movie was great! Although I do believe that the acting could have been alittle better. It was kind of dry in a way but it kept my interest. I really liked the way it was produced. It was really neat to see it down in the south like it was during the civil war. Even though the actors are not ""big"" actors they did a swell job expressing the play in a dramatized way. I believe that this movie should be seen by anybody who enjoys Shakesphere and is interested in a well put together movie of adventure and magic.Marshal Krause"
5,Vivid and visualized live in 1994,"This live CD's inner-sleeve shows some photos of Solomon Burke and his big band which consists of more than ten. He sings with a mike and a tulip in his hands. Not so large a stage is stuffed by his rhythm and horn section and background girls. Crammed people in this house of blues are heated up and sweated up. And the sound in this CD ""show"" you such vivid scenes. I've never seen his performance before, but I can ""see"" it thanks to this visualizing sound."
2,A BIG Disappointment!,"Always loved Solomon Burke, but was very surprised at how poor this album is. Save your money and pick up some of his studio work."
3,Solomon Burke Live,"This CD presents Solomon in his best form - live, and on stage. But the track Candy Rap is an embarrassment, for him, a foolish audience member, and this listener."
4,Another great offering from Spencer,"This is another book by Lavyrle Spencer that does not disappoint. Each book of hers that I've read has an interesting group of characters, and each book has it's own characters, location and story, so you don't have to worry about reading them in sequence.There's a wonderful life lesson in each book. If you like romances for grown-ups, you cannot go wrong with one of Spencer's."
2,NOT EVEN CLOSE TO A 4-5 STAR!,"I don't always review books I read unless they are really good or I don't think they live up to their other reviews. The latter is the case w/ this book. To be quite honest, I just never really cared about these characters. Actually, I'm still trying to force myself to finish it. The story line was just okay too. I don't know what made anyone give this more than a 3 star at the most. I have read two other books by her, Morning Glory and The Endearment. They were both very good. This was just okay. I almost gave it a one star, but I didn't exactly hate it either. I just didn't like it very much. Personally, I wouldn't waste your money or time on this one."
3,"At first, slow going","I had a hard time getting into this book. It was slow going. There were chapters that were of no interest to me at all. But I kept reading and am glad that I did. In the end, I liked both characters and how their story ended."
5,Honky Kicks ***!,"A friend of mine picked this album up and had me listen and I was knocked out! I don't know if any of you remember the Butthole Surfers but this is the bass player's new band. That is where the similarities end! This is southern-style, good old fashioned, beer drinkin' rock! If you like Ted Nugent, Thin Lizzy, Kiss, Beer, Roadsaw, or Novadose you'll have to pick this one up! The name of the first song on the record is ""Don't Shoot Baby I Love You"" need I write more?"
3,House of good tires by Honky,"I actually saw these guys after getting this album. I saw them at a small venue in SF, California. The have a great sound, with attitude and raw talent. They are from Texas so they have a southern feel to it, but to me they are just a good ol Rock n Roll band! Good cd and fun lyrics!"
4,"Great movie, but what the heck was Beth thinking???","As you might have guessed, I rented this movie solely for the chance to see young Colin Farrell, he is in his early 20's when this Irish, made for TV 3 and 1/2 hour miniseries was made, and he plays a young lad of 19 who falls in love with a woman who because of an unexpected pregnancy is sent to marry a 40 year old widower at the age of 19. This movie has almost all aspects of both the good and bad of life, love, hate, rape, hope, murder, tragic accidents, everything. It's well worth seeing for all the performances, not just Colin Farre's, although he did do an excellent job."
4,nostalgia,"I grew up in the age of this movie when, becoming pregnant at such a young school girl age was not acceptable.The story as I recall was very true to life for, anyone could identify with this troubled girl. Today it wouldn't be a big deal for a young girl to be pregnant and abandoned. Years ago, that was not the case.Although, this movie is dark and very brogish { it takes place in the hills of Ireland} I thoroughly enjoyed each and every part. No famous stars except {Colin Farrel} but it doesn't matter, the story is that compelling."
5,Fabulous Movie to see,This movie is one of the best. It is set in Ireland in earlier times and the story covers all aspects of life in those early days. The story is good from start to finish and the acting is great. I highly recommend it.
4,Sad story yet a good movie,"I have watched this movie twice and found it to be one which can make you want to cry and be heartsick for all concerned. The young lady has found herself in a position to where she has to make the best out of what is to say ""sad"". She loved an actor, got pregnant, married an older man, fell for a younger man, and then the story becomes sadder, then turns out for the best, depending on how you think of the other man. You will become hopeful for the young lady that she finds rebirth in romance with someone who can give her true love. She has a good heart, yet is misled in some ways. It's a true to life situation for the Irish countryside. I enjoyed the movie, yet wanted her to be able to spread her wings and live life with the man she finds to be her love mate. It's a different story and one you will think about. You will be glad you watched the entire story from beginning to end. A 4 star movie"
4,Good drama serie,Although English is not my native language (and certainly not Irish) I could follow most of the conversations within the movie. One thing that should be mentioned is that the box contains so called 'region 0' DVD's.I've been on holiday on Beara recently and therefore the movie had some extra dimension for me.
2,Not as good as it could be!,"This is a nice story with lots of dramatic scenery but it is full of inconsistencies that really ruin the movie. The main character's hair is short, then in scenes that happen a day or two later it is very long, then the next day it is short again. When one person gets buried in the graveyard, it is located downhill by the water. When another person gets buried in the same graveyard, it is up on top of a hill. It is very hard to concentrate on the plot, characters, etc. when this is happening all the time. But two stars for being a good story and having nice scenary."
3,Exotic sounds,"Some adroit and tasteful programming give this CD a gothic resonance to lend credence to the title and the artwork. Unfortunately, it takes the first five six tracks to get the hearth heated up - by track six we've gone from the purely erotic to the exotic, with a interesting mid-tempo ""Tighten It Up"" (with a small sample from James Brown's ""Papa Don't Take No Mess""?), a good track. ""You Don't Exist"" is melodically reminiscent of the Drifters' ""On Broadway"", lyrically it belongs to today. ""Try To Take Your Time"" is Top-40 material, as is ""Pretty Freak"", the first tune heard in which Leah opens up vocally. ""Fake"" is worth revisiting once in a while. The closer is a much different aural experience - a non-electronic keyboard supports a well-mixed, up-front vocal."
5,A plea to save our remaining ancient forests,"Rick Bass bares his deepest feelings about the forest where he lives in northwest Montana. This book is a collection of personal essays, some are straight forward pleas for the reader to take action, that show how important it is to to save the remaining ancient forests, not only in Montana, but anywhere. Other essays describe his experiences with the local people, wildlife, and the forest. Collectively, they all help us to understand the importance of saving our forests from the destructiveness of poor logging practices. Rick's passion for the forest comes through loud and clear. After reading the book, you'll be moved to write your congressperson"
3,Don't Hack the Yaak,"Rick Bass has written a plea that is at times elegant and at other times shrill. The best writing in the book are the stories of long-time valley residents (both human and animal) trying to exist in a habitat that is shrinking in the hands of indifferent government and corporate stewards. Every 30-40 pages there is the ripe whiff of the holier-than-thou that usually occurs when a gifted writer transplants himself to the West and somehow comes to believe he is the only one who can truly interpret its significance. But this is possibly a quibble based on the prejudices in my head as a longtime Wyoming rancher. In any case, it's good to know that each member of the Congressional delegation received a copy of this book, although it's doubtful that Conrad Burns or Craig Thomas ever cracked the thing."
4,A delightful story....,"""Castaways in Lilliput"" is one of those enchanting, delightful imaginary books and features 3 young children, who find themselves stranded in Lilliput, which was, to them, only a fairy tale before. Naturally, they all want to go home (although Peggy is, of course, delighted by the tiny houses filled with furniture); but they find themselves in quite a pickle as they grope around among the miniscule cities and desperately try to convince the Lilliputians that they are not wicked and violent giants.Quite an entertaining story; I didn't like it quite as much as some of Henry Winterfeld's other books, but worth the time indeed. I wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars, as 4 seems to be a bit underrated. Highly recommended for kids!"
5,An old charmer that will be remembered forever,"I recently got my hands on an old copy of this well-loved book. My 9 year old daughter was as enchanted as I was with this story of three kids who are castaways in a raft and find themselves on Lilliput. I was very vague on the details but I did remember how charmed I was when the Lilliputians brought food to the children: Tanker trucks with milk, wagons of tiny loaves of bread, teeny-weeny little cheese balls. I also remember how cool it was to picture the kids riding on the train. This book has held up well over the years, it did not seem dated at all. Definitely a must read!"
4,A good to buy book!!,"I found this book very interesting, and providing helpfull information for the average finch keeper. I have been raising and breeding exclusively gouldians for about 13 years now, so I find the genetics section in this book (though not VERY elaborate) of primordial importance. I also liked the vivid description of the nuptial dance, the sound and chirps etc... as well as the pictures. So, if to say, on a scale of ten, 1 being a very silly book and 10 an extensive genetical analyisis and nutritional guide for expert breeders, I give this book a well-earned 7."
4,A Good Place To Begin,"This book is one of a series of pet books which do actually tell you most of what you need to know if you want to keep the pets concerned.For once, I did things the right way round and bought the book BEFORE the birds, and as a result I have learned a number of tips which I hope will make my keeping of these beautiful birds more successful.The photos are excellent but I query whether the average finch keeper would need quite so much detail on finch genetics - and am left amazed that breeders seem to be going to such lengths to breed all colour out of a finch whose chief attraction, to me at any rate, is its bright plumage!"
1,Absolute junk,Began tripping my GFI within 1 week of use. Do not buy. Unfortunately I got what I paid for and it was a waste of money
3,Submersible or not Submersible?,The listing and packaging say this heater is submersible. The instructions clearly show it not submersed and stat it can only be used in the vertical position. I purchased this as a cheap back up for my tank / inexpensive way to heat the water I use for changes. It has been submerged on occasion but I haven't left it that way for more than a few seconds due to not knowing if it is truly submersible or not.Would have given it 5 stars if it clearly listed submersible or not.I really like the temperature setting dial which clearly shows the set temperature.Holds the temperature well.
1,"Liked it, until it died 3 months after purchase","Originally, I gave this heater a positive review but I must revise that, considering the unit went dead about 3-4 months after purchase. Not happy to have to replace it this quickly. I purchased the 100-Watt version.Additionally, the temperature gauge was never really accurate while it was working.My replacement will not be an Elite. After this experience, I doubt i'd purchase anything again from this brand."
2,Exploded,Used it and it essentially exploded in my turtles tank. I'm not sure why it exploded as it was submersed in the water.
3,its ok,"It does its job which is heating the aquarium but does not heat to the tempeture it's set on. I set mines to 79 degrees (f) and I use more then one temperure reader and both reads 85.1. To me thata big difference and I had this only for a month, I think thats why a couple of my toddler fish past out of the blue. My tank is an ok size it's only a 29 gallon, maybe for this heater you neen a bigger tank size (idk). So be careful on this heater if your tank is not that big. I suggest to buy this if you have an aquarium bigger then mine, it might work out better for you."
2,Lack of heat,Doesn't heat up to well. I have plenty with this wattage but this one does not put out much heat
5,A OK!,"Works like a charm, the price was right. I did not wait long for my order to arrive. Having this submersible heater is great because i don't have to worry much about moving the heater when i do water changes, with the levels lowering and rising."
1,I was turned off because it wouldn't turn off!,"I have owned a lot of aquarium heaters and they all seem to fail or just not regulate very well. I guess I should have known this would not be a good one based on the price as it was much lower than other ones. However, in the past it seemed like price did not equal quality. I have paid a lot for a heater just to have them die after only a few weeks of use. Well, this one failed right out of the box. No matter how much I adjusted the temperature it would not turn off. I have seen this type of failure before but not right out of the box. I should have returned it right away but got lazy and never got around to it. Well, it is winter again and I still need a heater. Not sure which product I should try next. Definitely not this brand.Tom"
4,Best version of him,"Mas Amedda was always one of the more interesting aliens in the prequels. This figure gets pretty high marks. The only thing I would like to see in a future update is a soft goods outer cloak. The hard plastic works well enough but limits articulation. Also, the soft goods would probably just look even more regal."
5,Adorable!,"Barney is a classic and what is not to love about him! He is friendly, polite, and always happy! This video is no different and of course my boys love to watch Barney and his other friendly dinosaurs dance and sing around. This episodes are simple yet they are full of positive messages including being active outside, wearing sunscreen, and finding shapes in the clouds. I love this video pushes spending time outside safely but in a fun manner, as I know how tempting it is to sit inside and let the kids watch TV in the air conditioning! Barney teaches his viewers to use their imagination and most importantly have fun!"
4,Well it's Barney...,My son really loves Barney and this video was no exception. Barney and his friends teach lessons and keep my son engaged during the show.
2,just ok,"my daughter has a few barney dvd's and this one is not her favorite one, she watched one's. She likes to participate (singing and dancing with barney) and this dvd do not have enough of singing and dancing. maybe for older kids is good but not for 2 year old."
3,Nice but nothing new,"Nice interesting , picture quality is max of course the story same story we heard how ever 3d makes it interesting to watch"
3,Not the most fascinating or in depth thing ever filmed,"The documentary is decent, but as with most things made for IMAX, needlessly boring in parts. Is it necessary to devote 10% of the film to filming people in a lab not doing to much to explain the concept of DNA? There are not many if 3D ""wowser"" effects which is a shame considering the location and the opportunity. One bonus, the director of Egyptian Antiquities, AKA,the camera hog, appearances are kept to a minimum which is a rare thing in any film on Egypt."
2,3D Could Have Been A Lot Better,"Mummies: Secrets of the Pharaohs was the first 3D feature I bought to test out my new Acer 3D monitor, and let me tell ya...The 3D was TERRIBLE. I was expecting some nice pop-out effects, but in the forty-or-so minutes of this documentary, there was only one: a lizard that randomly comes out at you during one segment.I'm sorry, but when I see 3D, I expect to see some really nice, cool-looking effects. I know that depth is a key element to 3D, but this video had too much inward depth and not enough OUTWARD depth. It works both ways!From now on, my official 3D Blu-ray review ratings will consist of 1 star maximum for content and 4 starts for 3D quality (1 being very poor, 2: fair, 3: good, 4: excellent). Mummies gets the star for content, but a very poor rating for 3D. Hence. TWO STARS overall."
3,"Interesting, but could be better","- very good quality images, but no to much 3D effects- interesting history, but very shot an superficial- no subtitles"
5,Secrets of the Pharaohs (Blu-ray 3D),This is a great Blu-ray 3D. The 3D shows good depth and color. It is interesting and educational.I would recommend it to anyone that has an interested in ancient Egypt and the mummies.
4,Pretty visuals and good 3D,"I'm a fan of Egyptian history and when I saw that there was a documentary in 3D I had to give it a try. I'm glad I did, the 3D is pretty good, there were times where the hieroglyphics looked like they were floating off the walls of the tombs. Most of the movie was like that but there were some areas where it looked a bit odd with perspective. Over all there was a good amount of things I learned from this movie and having it in 3D made it more interesting. My only complaint is that it was a bit short, should have been another15-20 minutes more.If you like Egyptian history and want to see some good 3D you should like this disc."
1,what 3d?,i saw only a 3d during the beginning part then nothing more. the content is less than i expected. its not yout typical national geographic or discovery channel thing.
1,Not a good option for 3d,"The 3d is not good at all! No subtitles. Also the documentary is not interesting at all, I watched the whole thing just beacuse Ive payed already for it (and I saw it on 2d) . Defenitely not a good option."
4,Mummies,I have alway been interested in Mummies. Since I can not travel seeing the movie was the next best thing. I didn't give it 5 stars because the 3D wasn't that great.
4,Good but not her best,"This set of short stories is similar in tone and setting to Doerr's two novels, Stones for Ibarra and Consider This, Senora. I think you're better off to read either of the novels so that you get a full feel of Doerr's beautiful writing. This collection of short stories feels like a lot of snippets that she didn't know where to fit into her novels."
3,"A Typical Story, Typically Told","The immigrant experience in America is well-trodden ground and unfortuntely Gish Jen's Typical American doesn't really add much to this well-established body of literature. Her writing style is good, the story she tells is moderately compelling (if frequently unrealistic) and on, and on, and on. There's nothing wrong with Typical American, but that's hardly a good reason to pick it up and read it. If you're interested in the American immigrant experience, I recommend Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides or Call it Sleep by Henry Roth. If Chinese family life is your interest, Wild Swans by Jung Chang or Life and Death in Shanghai by Nien Chang are far more worthy of your investment of time."
3,"Unlikeable protagonist, but it works for the story","My dislike for Ralph, the main character of this novel, marred my reading experience. I also found it too predictable when he fell under the spell of a huckster: everyone could see it would be a disaster except him.However, Ralph's temper and bad choices empahsized how his family was more or less stuck with him, because they were isolated as immigrants in the U.S. I also appreciated the period detail from the 1950s and 1960s, and the subplot about Ralph's sister Theresa.For a more nuanced, likeable story set thirty years later, I prefer Ha Jin's novel A Free Life. (Be warned, however, that one is also hundreds of pages longer.) Typical American is a decently written, engaging-enough book."
3,Good for an Evening's Enjoyment,This is definitely a book worth a read. Gish Jen takes us into the life of an immigrant and the world of wants versus needs. I would have liked there to have been more character introspection-- after all actions are very well but the soul of a book are the motives that drive characters and how they feel about their lives and decisions. On the whole I enjoyed this book- especially the arts where business scams were carried out. Although literay the writing style is easy to read. Much of the short sentence prose adds to the fragmentary nature of the characters.
4,Typical American,"Typical American is a roller-coaster ride of events. You get trapped, wondering what is going to happen next. Broken friendships, love affairs, divorce,and many other things. The freestyle form of writing by Gish Jen keeps you guessing through the whole story."
3,"Not great, but good nonetheless","I read this book. I didnt LOVE it, but I didnt hate it.It starts off very funny, but tries to hard to offer moral life lessons. It should pick a side (humor or life lessons)and stick to it."
3,hmmmm.,the first couple of chapter was interesting. but it got boring after a while. just normal immigrant story.
5,Hot!,"Bought these for my wife. They are not great to walk in, she tells me, but she looks fantastic in them.Do yourself a favor and treat that special lady in your life to these classic shoes.; )"
2,Pretty bad,"I'm always looking for a good haunted house/ghost flick, and I have to say I haven't seen a good new one in years. Instead of something new, here we have a movie that borrows aspects and ideas from a bunch of other haunted house/horror flicks and combines them into one... making this very unoriginal and very dull. Watch The Shining, Poltergeist, The Changeling, Amityville Horror, and others instead of watching this rip off flick."
3,Haunted House,"7 days to live , is a Haunted House horror - thriller movie made straight to dvd . About a couple who moves to a haunted house after their son died . 3 stars not bad at all ."
5,WONDERFUL INSIGHTS,I have seen this book on countless discount tables. I finally bought it and read it. This is not a tell all for lesbian nuns who reveal their sexual escapades while cloistered in a convent. This is a collection of stories told by ex nuns about their short stay in convents all across America. It is their story. Their life. Each of these women left for various reasons and all are now fullfilled in their life on the outside as out lesbians. There is nothing cheekie about this book. It is well written and well told. I am glad I finally picked it up and actually read it.
5,cloistered love,"In this book we encounter the biographies and personal photos of numerous nuns or ex-nuns who have ""come out"" as lesbians. they talk about how they came into convent life, how they discovered their sexuality, and how that altered their religious life. Very fascinating study.David Rehakauthor of ""A Young Girl's Crimes"""
3,A Very Sad Story,"""Lesbian Nuns"" is not intended as an entertainment piece and is unlikely to interest the casual reader. Those interested in psychology and/or sociology will find the stories of these women's lives interesting and, perhaps, troubling.The book leaves an almost overwhelming impression of youthful idealism shattered and betrayed."
5,HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE THE 14TH CENTURY,"THIS BOOK IS ANOTHER MANDATORY READING FOR ANYONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN THE EXCHANGE OF CULTURES OF THE INDIGENOUS OF TURTLE ISLAND AND THE AFRICAN, WHICH HAS BEEN GOING ON BEFORE THAT THUG COLUMBUS CAME OVER HERE."
3,"CD ""Christmas with Glen Campbell"" Not same as LP!","I purchase the LP many, many years ago and have just about played it out. When I found it on CD I was so greatful. When I received the CD it had most of the songs from the LP, but not all of them. I was so disappointed! I would really love to find the original LP done properly on a CD. The music is wonderful, and should not be fooled with!!!"
5,THE BEST DVD FOR MY BABY,"MY BABY IS 20 MONTHS OLD AND SHE LOVES JANE AND THE DRAGON, WE PLAY THIS DVD BEFORE SHE GOES TO BED AND IN THE MORNING IS THE FIRST THING SHE WANTS TO DO.2 THUMBS UP!"
4,A Sound of Thunder and Other Stories,A great novel by Bradbury. Sorry I didn't read this when I was younger. A must read for any Bradbury fan.
3,"Look great, go great with cute outfits, just don't walk","These shoes are cute and match outfits very well, but I think that they forgot about comfort. If you plan on walking around for awhile, these are not the sneakers to do it in."
5,You have to read this!,"You're Hired by Lorne Epstein is a terrific compilation of the actual to do's for not just being prepared for an interview but how to get that important interview. I especially liked `creating right livelihood' that section is appropriate for any one today that is under or not employed, even college student searching for a career choice. This is a book on how to play the game in the real world when preparing for an interview. You're Hired is a quick read and will definitely help you get the job that fits your life style. If you are a college student, unemployed and looking for work or have work and want to get a new position, you have to read this book!"
3,Good Book,"This is a good book if you are just looking for general information on interviewing tips, I did expect it to be a lot longer than it was however."
5,Excellent Album,"This is truly a great album and money will spent. I've been a fan since their first album and these guys keep getting better and better. The unique style, harmonies, and touch of hip-hop was awesome!!!! Looking forward to PART IV!!!!!!!!"
3,Not as good as the previous CD,"Although ""It's over now"" is my favorite song,the rest of the songs just don't live up to this song.""Missing You"" is o.k.,but I thought that the rest of the CD sounds kind of average.Not what I am used to with 112."
3,Ruffneck 112?,"This velvet voiced R&B quartet from the ATL skillfully makes Bad Boy hiphop dance tunes that will earn modest radio play much like the current G Dep joint and Faith's latest Cd, but the strength is in the slow tunes, like Missing You. I recommend this to fans of the club and the hotel."
4,A Nice Surprise,I have always loved 112's music so when I heard their fist single It's Over Now I was patiently awaiting the album. I am sooo lovin the fact that they are letting other memebers sing on this cd because there voices are tight to death. Missing You and Player are my all time favorites. The beat on Peaches & Cream speak for it's self you don't really have to know what there singing about. Although we ALL know what there singing about. LOL. I hope they continue in this direction for future albums.
3,3.5 Stars actually,I have been listening to this all day and it is pretty good. The first three songs are all great. The ballad's are...OK. Player is probably the best one. The track with twista is incredible. 112 like to have the interludes but they don't work as well on this album as they have in the past. Overall this album keeps me wanting more and should definitly get them some new fans. Peace
4,"""This is what we're looking for...""","I thought this was a better attempt than ""Room 112"", but the first album, ""112"", I believe is still their best album. I liked how they tried to write most of the songs and have Daron, one of the members, do most of the production.Songs that I enjoy the most are ""Missing You"", ""Player"", ""Smile"", ""Sweet Love"", ""Do What You Gotta Do"", ""I Think"", ""StilL In Love"". 112 has definitely not lost their soulfulness. This album also has some fun club songs like ""Dance With Me"" and ""Peaches & Cream"" which are a good switchup if you don't want to listen to only ballads and mushy love songs. However, I think that ""Missing You"" and ""Player"" stand out the most, vocally. Check those two out, I've never heard 112 hit the notes that way and I loove it. If you're tired of hearing Slim singing lead all the time and wonder if the other members have talent, don't sleep on this album because all the members have a lead part on this album!"
3,"112 ""Part III""","The hopeless romantic balladeers of 112 have returned with an album packed with hits. ""Peaches and Cream"" the smash single is clearly on of the albums strong points along with the other two singles ""It's Over Now"" and ""Dance With Me"". Daron Jones emerges as the leader of the group do to his production skills on this LP. Other highlights include the lovely ballad ""Missing You"" and another player anthem ""Don't Hate Me"" (feat. Twista). If 112 continues to make albums like this they should emerge into one of R & B's top groups."
4,It's About Time,Any 112 fan should be proud of their latest output. The best songs are the first three tracks.The first single 'Dance With Me' will blow your mind. This track is simply hypnotizing. I could not and still cannot get past the other tracks without hitting repeat again and again.'It's Over Now' a wonderful up-tempo ballad which features many of the members harmonizing together.'Peaches and Cream' is a sexual standout. If you've seen the video then you know what I mean.I am very pleased the rest of 112 (along with Slim) got a chance to shine...it's about time.
4,The gentlemen of R&B are back!,"112 is a really talented group. They wrote and produced most of the songs on the cd. They have a lot of nice songs such as ""It's Over Now"", and ""Do What You Gotta Do"". A lot of up tempo songs, a few ballads. My favorite on here is ""I Think"". The beginning of the chorus is: I think that you're a beautiful woman, and I think think that you deserve a good man. That was all I needed to be hooked. The song is very pretty. I like their second cd better, but this one is still pretty nice, too."
4,It's good but just like most of the other R&B albums..,"The biggest singles ""It's Over Now"" and ""Peaches & Cream"" are well rated judging by popularity. There are some weak tracks or as I call it, ""un-needed tracks"". The slow songs' melody and lyrics are very good such as, ""Sweet Love"", ""Smile"", ""Caught up"" and ""Do What You Gotta Do"". 112's latest album proves that the group is still one of the very best of the rhythem and blues industry."
4,112 does it again,"112 is one of those groups that consistently put great albums, and Part III their third release is no exception. They have proven that it is possible to make a smooth public transition from boys to men."
4,Helluva Comeback,"As I said before, 112's sophomore album ""Room 112"" showed room for growth and improvement, and they did just that in this CD. A lot of dance hits and slow hits, this album is clearly a junior replica of their debut self-titled album."
3,wanted more upbeat,"i heard dance with me and peaches & cream and fell in love with those 2 songs, but when i got the cd, i was kind of disappointed that more of the other songs didn't have the get up and dance feel to them. nothing wrong with the slow songs, i was just looking for a more bouncy cd."
4,A Review,"I have never been a big fan of R&B. However, after listening to this album, I fell in love with 112. The album is a refreshing drink in the fountain of boredom that is R&B. The guys produce and write an album that can be listened to from track one to the very end. This album, with its mature topics, can definetly attract some new fans to the R&B genre."
3,3 1/2 Stars for III,"I'm not a 112 fan, but I do like several tracks on this CD. The singles released so far, ""It's Over Now"", ""Dance With Me"", and ""Peaches & Cream"" are all very catch up-tempo tunes. I really liked 112's singing on ""It's Over Now"". This is my favorite song on the CD, probably because it sampled an old hip-hop song by Grandmaster Flash and Melle Mel -- ""White Lines (Don't Do it)"" -- A very good use of a sample from a classic hip hop song, so I'll give the producer of ""It's Over Now"" credit.I also liked the the mid-tempo song, ""Caught Up"", and the slow song ""Missing You"". All in all, a solid CD."
3,same old,"another r&b group, nothing interesting here, if you like to hear songs about oral sex, and other freaky topics this cd is for you."
1,"Please, god, not more of this...","I'll be frank. I'm a professional club DJ, I have 2000 or so CD's. I listen to everything in the world except country in my spare time, and I have to say, If you're looking for hip-hop/new soul/R & B, skip past this CD.This group is slick, like an overly produced and sound engineered product. They produce hooky spineless pop, not R & B. They're no more R & B then J. Lo is Latin music. Look elsewhere, like to Erykah Badu, Angie Stone, Amel Larrieux, and The Roots, to name a few."
2,112 No Energy,After listening to the 112 pt 3 album i must say i have not heard such a boring cd in a while. there are about 4 good songs and the rest are just a waste of space and time...
5,Beautiful Briefcase,"This is a beautiful, durable, quality item. I recommend this briefcase to anyone. For those wondering if it will fit a 17"" macbook pro, YES! My 17"" macbook pro fits perfectly with plenty of space for the power cable and other documents. It fits the equivalent of up to 3 17"" MacBooks with room to spare."
5,Great Movie,I love this movie. It has so much heart in it. I laughed I cried and I hoped for the best. This movie was great for me because it has a little bit of everything in it. I have to say it is more of a chick movie then a guy one so be aware. Otherwise highly recommend.
1,Less than half the book!,"Be careful! There is nothing in the product description that would alert you to the fact that if you order this ""custom core edition"" you only get the first 17 chapters."
5,Awesome Business,Really fast delivery. About 2 days. Good communication between the buyer and seller. Brand new book for the fraction of the cost. Thanks
2,Obtuse and too often scanty,"The primary feature of Askeland's text is in the speed with which its sections can be read. Unfortunately, this is due to the lack of necessary detail. Difficult concepts are often glossed over, while simpler topics receive undue attention. The example problems don't seem as relevant as they might be, and certainly bear more strongly on the author's skills than on the student's.I may be unfairly comparing this book with Callister's ""Materials Science and Engineering,"" but given the choice of either as a reference source, I would hesitate to choose Askeland. If you are stuck with the Askeland text for a course, but really need to understand material behavior, then invest in the Callister book as a backup - it will greatly enhance your understanding."
2,Difficult to Understand,"The text starts with an introduction to crystal structures that is needlessly complicated and do not give the student any sort of explanation as to how crystal structures relate to the topics dicussed later in the text. The questions at the end of each chapter are considerably more difficult than the sample problems in the chapter, making it very tough to learn from if the student is trying to learn solely from the book. Orange highlights are hard to read."
2,Still searching for answers,"This text is written in a reasonably straight forward style that simplifies understanding some of the concepts explained. I especially enjoyed the chapters on solidification strengthening and polymers.I did have a difficult time finding specific subjects using the index. Compared to the volume of subject matter the index is very small, with typically only 1 referenced page per item. There are several subjects that are explained several different ways, but to find each explanation requires searching through the chapters. this make the book less useful for reading desired material.In general this is an acceptable text book and would be useful for introductory materials classes."
1,Painful Read - Poor Presentation,The material is presented as if you already have a strong chemical background. What information is there stops short of explaining it in any type of useful manner. It certainly is not practical information. I purchased it as a Supplier Quality Engineer of Gray Iron Castings and walked away with little that I could use in the REAL world. Metallurgists that I work with confirmed this. The professor of the college course in Material Science discontinued using this book because his student were walking away with very little and he was only referring to this $180 book sporadically as to not confuse the students. Save your money.
2,Indications of Poor Quality,"Inside Front Cover: The characteristic exponent of ten for the speed of light, c, should be +8 or 8 and not -8. For the Fe-C phase diagram the labels of 'steel'and 'cast iron' on the %carbon-x-axis are reversed in position from what they should be. Polymer Chapter: 'PET' usually stands for poly-ethylene-terephthalate and not poly-ester although the first is maybe a type of the second. This might be a matter of different diciplines but 'PAN' here is said to mean poly-acrylic-nitrile while in the environmental field it means peroxy-acetyl-nitrate."
2,A Disappointment,"My 5 year old son loves to watch the Blue's Clues TV show, and we have the Blue's Clues Treasure Hunt movie. But the computer game leaves a lot to be desired. When you first start the game, Steve does a lot of talking - so much so that my son asked, ""Is all we get to do is watch?"". Finally we get started, but there is still too much waiting in the game - waiting for Steve to talk, or catch up. Also, when you are doing the activities, you don't know how long you have to do them to earn the clue. Finally you quit the activity in frustration, and there's the clue waiting for you. After this happened a couple of times, we realized we can do the activity as long (or as short) as you want, and still get the clue.We enjoyed playing going on the treasure hunt, but at times we shut down the game because we were frustrated and didn't want to wait any more."
4,nice,"Nice to see S&D finally givn the dvd release. I guess my review would be a bit biased as the part of the Stranded POW helt bent on revenge was played by my childhood Tae Kwon Do instructor Park Jong Soo. I remember a big poster for this movie hanging at the Dojo. Anyhow, worth the price for that movie itself. cheers"
1,This is not very good,"Queenan is obviously a smart guy but doesn't get very far here. The best parts are when he's shooting fish in a barrel (Kenny G, John Tesh, Cats..but honestly who needs to be told this is bad). However, his take on pop music is completely clueless. The Billy Joel section is typical. An entire chapter goes by of listing songs that he thinks are bad... and not a shred of rhyme or reason. He seems to be entirely concentrating on the lyrics and ignoring the fact that in popular songs the music is what matters. The reason Billy Joel, Elton John and ABBA are popular is that they have written lots of catchy memorable melodies. If there's something wrong with that Queenan hasn't revealed it here."
1,Witless,"I cannot imagine spending an evening with this man. I'm reminded of a roommate I once had who, after arriving home, complained about the traffic for 30 minutes EVERY SINGLE DAY. I sympathize, but please, if you're going to talk about it, give me something interesting. A few points in the book attempt to understand WHY something is bad, but he usually resorts to hyperbolic language that chastizes without providing any insight into the means of the failure. There are better social critics out there. Save yourself for authors like David Sedaris--""Santaland Diaries"" in Holidays on Ice is funny and inventive."
2,"Oh no, it can't be","Dear me, I am as much a snob as the next one, but really, this book left me cold. What let me down was that Queenan spent more time telling me X, Y, and Z sucked without ever really exploring why, and what about our culture encourages such suckiness. After a while it became so repetitive (this sucks, that sucks, etc.) and completely lacking in insight."
2,Goes for the easy targets,"Joe Queenan's latest title is a disappointment. I expected insightful and humorous commentary, (even if I did know in advance that Queenan was attacking obvious targets such as _Cats_, _The Celestine Prophesy_ , _The Bridges of Madison County_, and, yes, Red Lobster restaurants). The cultural criticism in this book never rises above the level of ""it sucks."" Oddly, the only even mildly amusing display of wit in the book is in the index's off-the-wall entries."
2,"Great premise;repetitive, mean spirited and loses steam fast","Queenan starts off with a good premise by exploring American kitsch. However, in a land overflowing with material for his book, Queenan is guilty of being repetitive and mean spirited in his attacks. The 2nd half of the book meanders and loses steam rapidly. I couldn't wait to put it down. Queenan's talents lie in the short columns and bits he does on Imus. For someone who grew up in Philadelphia and North Philadelphia at that, he displays an amazing amount of snobbery and elitism. Get off your high horse, Joe! You write for People magazine, the bible of kitsch! This is an account of a writer who has significant problems dealing with his past. And finally, what is with the attack on Billy Joel; did you two get into a bar fight or did he steal your parking spot as well in the Hamptons?"
1,"Step off your high horse, your Majesty","Just because the man's last name contains a royal title does not give him the right to berate American society. If he doesn't like America and all it stands for, he should jump into the Doloren time machine back to 19th century Europe. ""Joe Queenan's America"" does not belong to him alone. America is a free country, and we're all entitled to our pop cultures--good or bad. The right to choose between the Opera or Chris Farley movies is our choice! Do NOT buy this book. His Royal Highness doesn't deserve the royalties."
1,Completely un-funny.,"Queenan takes a look at contemporary America circa 1999 and makes belabored, uninsightful, derisive remarks about what he sees and he laughs at his own wit, expecting you to laugh along. I would if it was funny.If you've ever read any of his articles you pretty much know the tone here. That's his whole schtick.Anyway, if you are interested in knowing that Joe Queenan thought Cats sucked or are in the mood for a 3rd rate Dave Barry wannabe (w/o the laughs) this is the book for you."
3,Elitist yet entertaining,"Joe Queenan is an obvious snob, but his book portrays him as a loveable snob. He obviously has an elitist view about most of his subjects, but when he deals with Branson, MO, I can't help but laugh. Having heard from people who have been there, Queenan hits it on the mark -- washed-up acts play to the blue-haired crowd and perform their ""hits"" up front, fearful that that the majority of the audience might be dead before the second act!!! Queenan is also on the mark regarding ""Cats"" on Broadway. I have spent a long time wondering WHY people would pay to see this show and now, thanks to Queenan, I know -- it's the publicity!!! You're an out-of-towner and have no idea what you're doing in the Big Apple so you go see ""Cats."" When all is said and done ""Cats"" will be the longest-running show on Broadway, but it won't have nearly the impact ""A Chorus Line"" had because it doesn't have the HEART of that show."
5,A smashing indictment of our most beloved pop cultures.,"Queenan's ""Red Lobster ..."" is unique because of the manner with which he quantifies trash. Just when I'd begun to think I was OK, he speared one of my sacred bovines.No longer is it acceptable to just be bad -- Joe teaches us that we must really work at it. He deserves a case of Boone's Farm and the collected recordings of Zamfir for this literate, engrossing exploration into the depths of our dumbed-down existance."
2,Umm...,"Well, I bought his book with some high hopes (I hate Jerry Lewis as well...), and I would agree that his trashing of that Western literature juggernaut, V.C. Andrews and her classic canon, ""Flowers in the Attic"" is the apex of the ""HA HA's"" that this book will deliver, but over all, I was dissapointed. Too much, far too much complaining, and not enough ""HA HA's."" I need more ""HA HA's,"" Mr. Queenan. You need more reviews of ""Flowers in the Attic"" and less of ""Cats sucks."" And I do not mean for those comments to be taken literialy; just use them as a spring board... And by the way, Red Lobster sucks."
3,Funny but disappointing,"Joe Queenan's earlier book, ""If you're talking to me. . ."" was hilarious, and though his latest book contains the occasional good belly laugh, for the most part I found it disappointing. The main problem is that he spends too much time saying that things suck, but only infrequently delves into why. When he does, as in his summary of the book ""Flowers in the Attic"", he is a genius comic writer, but most of the time he just describes things as sucking, which gets a little old after awhile."
3,"Funny, but lacking in depth","This book was really funny, but who is this author to claim to be an elitist anyway??? The guy is a writer for TV Guide! That is like a hamburger flipper at Burger King claiming to be a gourmet chef!"
1,"Snipe snipe snipe, tripe tripe tripe","I've never actually thrown a book away before. Not until this one. I took it to the doctor's office to read while waiting, and after my appointment I had to pull over and find a Dumpster because I didn't even want the thing in the car. My personal beef: Queenan includes all horror fiction in his definition of ""trash"" without appearing to have read any of it very carefully. I read a lot of horror fiction (and sometimes write it), and I'll be the first to admit that a lot of it is idiotic crap -- but I don't believe that Peter Straub, Dan Simmons, and Clive Barker deserve to be mindlessly included in that definition. In his attempt to show how smart and above-it-all he is, Queenan comes off looking stupider than the stuff he means to skewer."
1,Waste of time and paper,"Joe Queenan tries so hard to be ""cute""...too hard. This is the raving of an author who seems to hate everything particularly American..I found myself asking the question, so, Joe, why not try living somewhere else? This is a pseudo-intellectuals vain attempt at humor, and it is destined to end up on the bargain table at 3.98.. Still too expensive.....a complete bore from a complete bore"
1,Skip it,"A thouroughly repellent book. Queenan repeatedly makes it clear that his beef is not in fact with ""Cats"" or Danielle Steele or Kenny G, but with the people who enjoy them. The pseudo-hip notion that lack of sophistication is a good excuse for contempt ought to be buried with the decade that gave it birth. As for Queenan, these latter-day Menckens ought to pay a little more attention to how the master ended his days. You can't douse everybody in sight with hatred without splattering yourself too. Lighten up, Joe."
1,A major disappointment.,"Joe Queenan, a truly funny man (be it in print or ranting to Imas about Barbara Streisand,etc.), has attenpted to clone ""If You're Talking To Me Your Career Must Be In Trouble."" That previous endeaver was fast paced, outrageous, and a true ""one nighter."" This, on the other hand is a reach.. with each bash an attempt at one-upping himself in his assessment of his previous target. With laughs few and far between, getting through a chapter a night is a chore.Maybe for a comedy fix I'll just reread ""Brain Droppings."""
4,Just Desserts to the Cosmically Deserving,"This book is not elitist. Brother Queenan speaks the simple truth. We all should know by now that, in a perfect world, Michael Bolton, Kenny G and Yanni (not to mention the esteemed Mr. Tesh) should, at present, form the nucleus of a truly mediocre lounge band playing weeknights at a Ramada Inn in Des Moines. Unfortunately, as those gushing reviews of The Horse Wisperer on this very site indicate, many in the American public are unwilling to recognize the fact that their pop-subculture predilections do not rank in the same cosmos with true art. Pardon me for saying so, but Queenan ought to be issued the Congressional Medal of Honor for not showing the common, overly egalitarian tendency to spare the delicate feelings of a few misguided Celestine Prophets. The stuff is miserably bad. You can read or listen to it. You can even like it. But you are forbade from calling it other than what it is: drivel. God Bless Joe Queenan for saying so. Ahmen."
2,Too negative with no redeeming laughter,I loved his premise of the book but 99% of the book is about things that suck and after 99 pages you get his point and with 1 laugh in the book it's not worth taking the clever journey with Mr. Queenan. So instead of reading this book listen to Billy Joel!!!!
4,good but short of pictures taken in Korea,It is interesting that Mrs. L visited to Korea and met Empereor Gojong in 1905.But there is only one picture taken at the time of her visit to Korea in 1905. I think she had more pictures taken in Korea.It'll be great that the pictures are open to public.
1,the end.,"This will probably be my final word on this CD. First of all, let me clarify some points. The honourable critic from Madison, on the 22nd of March mentioned the Oscars. Obviously the honourable critic of Pittsburgh should get an eye check for not seeing that. Now, as for me being an amatuer...well, ""ha!"". Look at the arguments in the review from Pittsburgh: that the Scatman is good because he helped people. I'm sure he did, but if that is the only reason why you should buy his CD then my point has been proven. The music is so bad he needs another reason to sell. Because the music is nothing. No meaning. Nothing special. Not innovative. I could go on. The fact that he's famous because of life achievements shows how commercial the music industry has become. There is no room for genuine talent. It is sad. The only thing the Scat man inspires me to do is to shoot myself when I think about what people like him have done to music."
4,An excellent epitaph,"I was in Japan when I heard of the death from cancer of Scatman John (Larkin). Sad news, as I felt he was about to be a big star.I hope he was pleased with the finished album, as ""Scatman's World"" is very intoxicating, full of scat and very tuneful. The two singles, ""Scatman"" and ""Scatman's World"", are brilliant, but ""Quiet Desperation"", ""Song Of Scotland"", ""Time"" and ""Only You"", to name four, are just as good.A mix of disco and jazz-influences, it's really pleasing to the ears and just a whole lot of fun.Good one Scat!"
5,excellent cd!,"the other reviews are all bs. they obviously haven't read about the scatman and his stuttering problems. just for that, he should recieve an oscar. he has failed so many times, but won't ever give up. as if that wasen't enough, his cd is also awesome"
4,A great CD with variance and great all round fun,"Scatman's World is a great CD including the hits ""Scatman's world"" and ""Scatman"" along with it are some nice tunes like ""Only You"" and a seemingly sprite-comercial-like ""popstar"" I used it as one of our school's homecomming dances and the whole school loved it. So if you like beat this a great CD."
5,Hehehehe...I love it!,"... this is a great cd. it's so cheerful and full of happiness. the rythm is great and it always puts me in a good mood when i listen to it...just by his music you can tell that Scatman John is nice man with only good intentions. rest in piece, John. and buy this cd, world. it's terrific"
4,What's not to like?,"I remember hearing the Scatman song when this album came out and paying no attention to it. It was cute and catchy, but I soon forgot about it. Well, here I am 10+ years later writing a review. I got the album recently, and I'm sorry I didn't get it sooner. This is pop music in the best sense of the word. The whole album is catchy, upbeat, and fun to listen to. I get the feeling the whole scat/dance beat combination was probably expected to yield only a novelty hit when Scatman John first recorded, but to his credit his talents proved appealing and the man sold millions worldwide. The album comes in at 48 minutes or so, and you'll enjoy listening to every single one."
5,Stunning instrumental album,"Cannot agree with previous poster, this is a very, very fine album, voted second best of 06 on ProgArchives. Great compositions and musicianship."
2,"Undoubtedly, PFM's worst!","As a fan of PFM from the beginning (I even own the much loathed ""PFM? PFM!""), this album rates even below that in my book. The only redeeming quality is that Patrick Djivas (bass player) gets to shine more on this CD than on previous ones. That's it. Very disappointing. 2 stars only due to allegiance."
1,Scientific Inaccuracies fill this book,"This is THE perfect book for those that hate SUV's, dispise Republicans, love political correctness, and don't care about accuracy. If inaccuracies and blatant science nonsense offend you, this book will offend you."
4,Earth systems logical thoght processes.,"The ideas exposed in this book may not be shared by all astrobiologists/scientists however I find its Earth systems approach highly valuable, taking the reader through the thinking process behind most current astrobiological hypothesis on the evolution of a habitable planet. Thus it is not the conclusions it reaches which I personally find of the highest value but its underlying logical thought process and the manner in which the author approaches as well the non specialized reader by ways of powerful analogies. Ihrenes 2006."
5,Very good read,"Some parts of this book repeat several times (could have been edited better), but it is an eye opening book. The latest theories are represented here in a very logical progression. Very enjoyable and educational read."
2,Mind Numbing,"While a potentially interesting topic, the authors bored me. The consistantly repeat themselves. I don't know how many times I was told we know the furture because our authors have studied the past! The science was burdened with pseudo-short stories of past and future Earths which often turned out to be directly related to our authors. I felt the actual scientific content here presented could have been presented in a quarter of the pages much more clearly. After reading it in two nights I am left with a feeling of a mind numbed through repeated mental bludgeoning."
1,Oversimplified to appeal to a Peg Bundy.,I was disappointed. They sometimes oversimplify to the point of being wrong. They butcher the C02 cycle to explain why plants will go extinct...I couldn't finish it. Save your money.I donated my copy to the library and suggested they put it in the childrens section. You will get more out of renewing your Scientific American subscription.
2,sticker problem,"This cane came yesterday and overall it's just o.k. Quite light weight to the point of being a bit flimsy. But the problem I had was that I ordered the bronze, paying an extra $10, and found that 6 inches of the front of the cane is covered with a big white sticker. By the time this was removed and the sticky stuff gone, the cane underneath was dark and splotchy looking. Not a good thing when they advertise colors. In calling the company I learned that the sticker was not to be removed, it ""identified"" the cane. And that they ""aren't responsible for what pictures Amazon posts in their sales"". Just a little warning if you thought you wanted a color - get one that blends with the huge sticker."
5,Very good product at a best price,"This Duro-Med Quad Cane is excellent. I bought it for my mother-in-law and she is very happy with its light weight and stability. It is very strong too. And for $25.07, it is a great deal."
2,cheap and it shows,"Okay, I got this for my dad to be safer than his regular cane. This is made of cheap metal (it just has that thinner than average cheapie look). It adjusts easily, but the locking screw to hold it once adjusted sticks out a bit (you don't see it in the photo but it's enough to catch on things). The bottom plate with the four little legs is a cheap looking piece of metal and it's not evenly spaced....the rectangle is ""off"" so it looks funky. The price was right but I'll likely return and spend a bit more to get a more solid appearing cane. I bought this in black so can't report on the other colors."
2,May be dangerous for wobblies,"Our experience is that people who are rather unsteady (wobbly), like my wife and I, may tend to trip over the base of this cane. For them a walker or rollator would be much safer. Also, the feet on this cane do not sit evenly on the floor, which doesn't inspire confidence, although it probably doesn't contribute to the tripping issue. We could not recommend this cane for wobblies, like us, and have had to give it a low rating."
5,Ordered for my Aunt,"I ORDERED THIS FOR MY AUNT AT HER REQUEST. I LIKED THE PRICE. NICE QUALITY CANE FOR THE PRICE. I WORK IN A NURSING HOME AND SEE THESE EVERYDAY, WAS IMPRESSED WITH QUALITY, PRICE AND FAST TURN AROUND SERVICE."
1,unusable,I got this for my mom. It's completely unusable because the quad base is horrifically uneven. I do not recommend this to anyone unless you want them to fall.
1,Duro=Med Cane,"This cane is GREAT. The price, quality and service excellent. It is reliab le for my 83 years, and very attractive too. It arrived within three days.Joyce"
3,Quad Cane,"This is an okay product for the price but it is wobbly. I have tried to learn to set it in such a way that all 4 legs land at the same time but I gave up. Also the legs are not equidistant from the center so when walking with it in my left hand, I had to turn the handle backwards to avoid tripping over it."
4,cane that will not fall down,The cane arrived in pristine condition. It was fully assembled. All that was necessary was to open the box. This cane is adjustable. It is not necessary to stoop down to hold onto the cane.
4,Grandma's Happy,"I bought this for my grandma who is 83 yrs old. She's been complaining of losing strength in her legs. She started using a cane two years ago but during winters, I'm afraid it wasn't stable enough.So far, she is happy with it. She says she keeps it next to the sofa because it helps her get up.Grandma says it was very easy to put together and really appreciated that I thought of her safety. I got her the bronze and she likes it more the standard black or silver."
5,Good value,"Fast shipping, good value for this product. The cane is sturdy and it doesn't have to be hooked to a table or stood in a corner. It stands up by itself. As usual, a great purchase through Amazon."
2,Reading Rhetorically,"It is pretty good. Im not a fan of the class, so I don't really like doing the work."
3,I'm so torn on this issue,"The bad thing about this cd is that it's too short, a little over half an hour and there aren't that many songs. There are only 4 songs with lyrics and some other tracks with instruments but there are too many tracks with noises or using the keyboard. That wouldn't have been a problem if they had more songs or just instrumentals using various instruments, naturally. The good thing is the the few songs that they do have are good and they make you want to get up and do a silly folk dance. The lyrics aren't growled out like they usually are on their other cd's. While listening to this cd you'll get the feeling that you're in the forest because of the occasional animal sounds.Overall this is a good cd it just needed more songs. So if you want to listen to a somewhatly cooled down finntroll then get this cd. If you can try to buy this somewhere else because 30 bucks is way too much for any cd."
1,"Very boring, expected this to be so much better","Title basically says it all. I liked Jaktens Tid, Midhattens, Trollhammaren and Nattfodd alot. Alot of reviews I've read about this sounded good. I might be the only one but I found this boring. But I do give it credit on being unique. I don't recommend this but I can see why alot liked it."
3,"The first, not the best","This was not as good an album as I had remembered from the days of vinyl, but the recording is faithful to the original. It has a very dated sound, and sounds very much like an album from a band which has not yet found itself. That said, this disc is not without its moments, and no Nektar fan really wants to be without it. In terms of production and writing, though, it is fairly two-dimensional. I still enjoy it very much."
4,JOURNEY TO THE CENTRE OF THE EYE - NEKTAR,"This is a very good album.If you like ""Back to the Future"",you will probably like this.Very progressive.One or my favorites by Nektar including ""Back to theFuture"" & ""Down to Earth"",even though ""Down to Earth"" has a harder,more rock edge to it.This is more progressive.BIRDMAN"
1,Awful,"This book is laughable and will only be appreciated by the most far out political correctness wackos, i.e, the type who refer to a ""manhole"" as a ""personhole""."
4,Great bluesy album from the Ace of Bass!!,"Ya know it's a shame to see so little reviews for the work of Lee Rocker and (and The Stray Cats too for that matter). All of The Cats are solid musicians who had much much more to say musically than just Rock This Town and Stray Cat Strut.Lee Rocker proves again and again that he is the best upright bass player in the game. This particular album is a strong hard mix of both rockabilly and blues and even has some horns thrown in for a full, rich and rockin' sound. Great stuff!! Lee has managed to surround himself with top notch musicians who are obviously as passionate about their musical roots as he is.You can't go wrong with ANY of Lee's albums and this is a great variation which incorporates a strong blues sound with his normal rockabilly style for a very satisfying listen. Catch him in concert if you can!!"
2,Even my 6 year old was bored..,"After we watched this I came back to Amazon to see what kind of reviews it got. I was surprised that it received 5 stars out of 5. Now I realize there is not a lot out there in terms of Jewish Holiday movies/videos. So I really really wanted to like this. But I honestly didn't, and my 6 year old daughter was rather unimpressed as well. The puppets were ok, but the story was ""meh"", and the songs were repetitive and boring. My daughter was making fun of the video as we watched it together.Look, for $3.99, I would recommend you check it out and make your own opinion. Apparently I am in the minority here because 5 other reviewers rated it 5 stars. If my daughter liked it I would probably have given it at least 4 stars, but if this video couldn't even entertain a 6 year old, 2 stars is the max I would give it."
4,Super melodic and rhythmic music.,"As in most cases Mike Mainieri's group Steps Ahead delivers top notch musicianship, presenting the innovative and almost timeless instrumentals, containing lots of rhythmic layers.Thomas Lynghus, musician, Denmark"
5,"Smooth, Sophisticated, International","Some tracks on this CD such as ""Festival"" and ""Stick Jam"" connected instantly with my jazzy spirit. Steps Ahead is a smooth and sophisticated melting pot of various international jazz talents.grandmarquis@mail.com"
3,Lost dimension without Brecker,"Had high hopes for this CD, but was disappointed. Steps Ahead took a big step down from the pinnacle of inventive, cutting edge jazz when Michael Brecker left. The band was such a creative mix. Now it's missing a main ingredient: Imagine trying to make gumbo without a roux. Spend your money instead on ""Magnetic"" or ""Live In Tokyo 1986"" by Steps Ahead when they truly were miles ahead."
2,Pleasant but light,"An enjoyable and entertaining read for the uninitiated. However a little too heavy on the cliches, and absent of real substance for the serious T'ai Chi student to get much from."
4,laws of life,I had been practicing tai-chi and chi-lel for more than a year almost everyday when I started reading this book. It is a very simple yet effective story reflecting our everyday life. It reminds us not to forget the simple but very important laws of life.
1,Stupid one click purchase!,"This album was accidentally purchased because of ""one click"" when I was switching between two other applications...$9.49 wasn't worth complaining to Amazon about. However, $9.49 is worth complaining about the utter garbage called ""music"" from this download.Stay away unless you have no taste in music."
4,Understanding the Gallery Biz,"The most valuable information--by far--in this book comes in the form of frankness. Dorrell gives hard $$ numbers and percentages regarding sales, commissions, and other dealings. This, undoubtedly, will be eye-opening for some. I really enjoyed seeing this stuff in black-and-white. Yes, we hear numbers here and there, but it's still nice to see it in print and straight from someone in the business. His sections on statements and bios I found to be very weak. And some things (like ""newsletters"") seem to be an afterthought. But that's not what this book is for. It will 1) prove you're not alone in living the artist's life and 2) give you enormous respect for gallerists and the hardships that some of them endure for their art and their artists. It's a very easy read and you'll appreciate the candor of this Midwestern gallery dealer."
1,Not worth it,I found the author to be self-serving in his writing. Nobody REALLY wants to hear about his boozing and depression. What little advice he offers is common sense for which you need not buy this book.
5,Frank and insightful,"I thought this overview of the art scene to be very readable and, after ten years as a landscape painter, rang true from a business perspective. I enjoyed the author's philosophizing best but there are some practical tips as well. People who are accustomed to the political correctness and posturing of academia and the avant guard are going to find this book a little too frank for their tastes. Dorrell writes to the point and has a midwesterner's impatience for inauthenticity which will rub some the wrong way. I found the honesty refreshing.This book isn't really a how-to. It is more a biography of one man's navigation through the treacherous waters of the fine art business. I found it so fascinating I read it in two days."
4,Newsletter Maven,"Having bought excellent training CDs from Lynda.com in the past, I was happy to see that the company expanded into book publishing with the InDesign CS2 book by Brian Wood.The book itself is very well written and thoughtfully organized, but another huge advantage is the inclusion of training videos and PDFs that go a long way in helping users get grounded in InDesign CS2.This book represents an excellent value. The inclusion of exercise files based on actual projects is a far superior way to learn the program than some of the basic, generic instruction found in ""Visual Quickstart"" books, although those books are reasonably priced and do convey a lot of information. I've bought and value those books.But Brian Wood's book is the state-of-the-art in InDesign instruction, a fitting companion to a phenomenal page design program. If you want to learn InDesign at a reasonable price, this is the only way to go."
5,InDesign CS2 Hands-On-Training,This book is absolutely the best resource if you've never used InDesign. I spent 6 weeks in a course in which we were told to do things but never why or the alternatives. I wish I hadn't spent the time or the money of the course as the first 100 pages got my head wrapped around basic concepts the course was supposed to do. I should have realized when I was initially confused and not getting answers to turn to a product from lynda.com as the books and training are superior to anything on the market.
2,Could have been more enjoyable,"I bought this novel based on only the reputation of the author and past novels he has written. I did not know this was one of a series. I was lost during the first third of the book trying to fathom out reasons for the actions and fears of the characters. No mention of a prior book anywhere. Lots of questions go unanswered at the end of a chapter then show up later as a flashback or a narrative as to what had happened. I may have enjoyed the book more if I had read the first of the series. I'm not really a science fiction type although some parts were plausable. I found the ending to be irritating, with unresolved questions. I doubt if I will by the next in the series if one come out."
2,I feel cheated!,"...we join this X-Files in progress, and finish because there is nothing else on...Yes, I was another who purchased this book after reading the cover, where there is no mention of it being a sequel. It took reading up to the 176th page until I felt the actual story of the book started, and the summary of the last book was over. Goddard's writing style is also a little annoying, the book reads like a history text of events that are taking place in the present.I gave the book two stars because it had at least enough in it to enable me to finish the thing."
1,What a waste,This was by far the worst book I have ever read. I can hardly believe a publisher actually thought it was worthy to publish. The plot is ludicrous and loosely strung along. I only finished this book simply because I had to see if the ending was as innane as the rest of the book. It was.
5,Brilliant!,"Length:: 2:47 MinsDear Capo-tuner, Where have you been all my life?I saw a picture of one of these in a music magazine, and nearly ran to buy one.As a lifetime guitar player and online guitar instructor, I heartily recommend this to my guitar students, and anyone who plays guitar.It functions really well, both as a tuner, and as a capo. One less thing to lose track of!Tuning is made super-easy by the fact that the screen goes from red to green when the note is correct. Bright, easy to see.And as a capo, it has the added benefit of helping me quickly make sure my strings are still in good tune, even with the capo on up the neck.And the price is right.Whoever designed this little beauty, bravo!Lisa McCormick, Online Guitar InstructorIntellitouch CT1 Capo Tuner"
1,Looked good at first,Unit stopped respondeing after about 3 weeks. Replacement batteries did not work. Very disappointed as i hoped this would make key changing quick and easy.
5,PF awesome,"Just what you need if you're Perhaps Feeling TEKnichal work with some jars. Are perfect for any application you throw at them. Airtight, strong, nice clear glass. I will be buying more."
3,Poor packaging!,"I'm aware ordering glass online and having it shipped is pretty dangerous. But when I opened the box there was only bubble packaging on the top of the jars, nothing on the bottom. Picking the jars up out of the box I could just hear all the glass rolling around. Not the smartest move on the packaging department. I did have enough good jars for what I needed, but very disappointed for getting what I actually paid for."
4,huh.....,"When i received my package and opened it, i found that one of the jars was shattered! only one though. This is most likely ups's fault. there were peanuts and paper inside with the jars and a fragile sticker on the outside. Overall these are some damn good jars, just wish they didnt break in the shipping process. Also the lids seemed kinda cheap"
1,RIP OFF!,You can find these for around $7 at your local grocery store. Sometimes turning to Prime for everything you need can come back to bite you.....I wasted $24 on 3 cases of jars from Amazon since I did not price check locally first. So much for frugal canning.
5,Love My LIttle Jars,"I purchased these to make little apple pies in, and they worked perfectly. You can fill them with your crust and pie filling and freeze them until ready to use, then, you just pop the lid off and bake them. Delicious little apple pies (or whatever pie you want to put in them.)"
4,Good for what I needed to make jarpies,"Ordered this size which I could not find in stores locally. Wanted to make pies-in-a-jar for Christmas Eve dessert. While the recipe preparation seemed to take me hours, the jars worked well. I like the concept and have more recipes to try. I kept the packing flat they came in...easy to store that way in a single box in the garage. If I tire of their original use, there's always good uses for glass jars...or easy to resell."
5,Great for Christmas Gifts,Jars were just the right size for my individual fruit pie crisps and great for the freezer. I'm giving them for Christmas gifts this year.
5,Sam Shepard's best,"I love this play! Sam Shepard is a brilliant playwright and has done it once again.Lie of the Mind is relatable with a beautiful storyline and solid characters.Hard to find at booksellers, order it here and save some time and money."
2,Not up to par....,"As a theatre major and a huge fan of Sam Shepard's body of works, I was excited to read ""Lie...."" The play has gained popularity recently, especially in academic theatre circles. The characters, however rich, never seem to truely develop. The plot is stalled from the first scene -- the whole piece seems to be nothing but one loud, emotional outburst after another. If you want to be exposed to the greatness of Shepard, stick with ""Buried Child"" or ""Fool for Love"" -- even ""Curse of the Starving Class"" shines far above this work."
1,Review #2,"I'm writing this second review because my first one did not get published. Imagine that--censorship and I think the worst word I used was ""sucked"".I'm going to say it again: this CD is a complete waste of time and money. There is not one cut here that is deserving of any replay, let alone a single play. You would think with two songs having ""interesting"" titles, there might be something redeemable, but, alas, no.So, here's my final thought: This CD should come with a warning label of ""CAUTION: MAY CAUSE DROWSINESS OR EXTREME BOREDOM. This CD has cooties."
3,Stick with Wolfe's earlier adventures,"Just finished this book and my overall reaction was ... yawn. All the elements are there -- Archie, Fritz, Wolfe, beer, orchids, etc. But this is one of the later books in the series and there's a certain ennui evident. The mystery seemed over plotted, the characters under developed, and any genuine charm was missing. Of course even subpar Nero Wolfe is entertaining, so I'm not sorry I read it. I just enjoyed the earlier books so much more, and seeing the series go downhill is depressing."
2,"Even for Stout, a rotten puzzle","Perfectly agreeable novel, until the denouement; the reader is not privy to information necessary to solve the case, and the solution relies on Wolfe's assorted henchmen and colleagues accomplishing a bit of routine work better than the police would. Perfectly ridiculous."
2,Why Did She Write It?,"Stout creates a female character here who writes a poem. She is moved to write it because she has killed a squirrel and is mourning its loss. Her turn of phrase is ""If Death Ever Slept...""This supposes, of course, that death never sleeps. The conceptual buzz much informs this book. As detective fiction goes, it is leisurely and ruminative, so I give it only the two stars you see. However, I enjoyed its characterizations of the relationships in ""the family."" Archie's insecurities and professional jealousy are never better described than they are here, and the other extended family members are given a good airing.But why did she write it? If it was because she felt bad about the squirrel and wants to share, she almost succeeds. There is too little satisfaction at the conclusion of this one; its tone of futility and moral loss rival the way the reader feels at the end of ""Fer-de-Lance."""
4,Interesting study of gambling and greed,"Not a great film, but if you are interested in greed, money and gambling then this is the film for you. The premise is What would you do if you found a wallet with a winning 6 million dollar lottery ticket in it? Keep it? What if you had already tried to call the tickets owner before you found out it was the winner? The directing is good and most of the acting of the main characters is acceptable. Jones's performance is noteworthy. The dialog is good in places, but at other times grossly overdone. In addition, some of the minor characters detract from the film by overacting. Critics have accused it of having too many twists and plot manipulations, but much of the film takes place as a poker game. In poker you never know what the other guys cards are until the end."
1,Definitely not recommended.,"I'm afraid that the reviewers who didn't like this movie understood it all too well. At times it promises real drama and tension, but never delivers. There are too many character twists with no basis. And the ending really does make the viewer feel cheated. This is a really poor attempt at making a movie."
5,Wonderful Film by Jeff Probst,"Wonderul film by first time director Jeff Probst. Matthew Lillard shines again, and Ryan Reynolds is funny and effective as well. It really is a fun popcorn film on a Friday or Saturday night."
3,Pretty good actually.,"Jeff Probst first movie is actually pretty good. It's not an Oscar winner by far, but it's really pretty good. Probst wrote and directed it. It's about a group of friends and their weekly poker game. I liked this movie and recommend it. There's an A list cast also. It's probably not their best acting jobs, but the sory is what makes the movie."
4,is or isent this the game i want,"This is a vary fun and hard game to play.IF YOU KNOW HOW TO PLAY IT!!! dont play this game unless you are a GREAT gamer and know what to do because you are just a good gamer and know your video games or have the book to go along with it. man, i would still be at the first leavel clueless if i dident have the gide for it."
3,your all stupid,"Alright, the guys name is supposed top be stupid, but I geuss some stupid 11 year olds brain can compute that. Ok, it ain't the best game in the world, bu the game is meant to be dumb. Dumb as in humnerous. This game really puts the mind to work, if you think the entire game is about talking to people your just stupid, you are probably failing math, and you don't even try to figure out what it's about before you critisize."
1,THE WORST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!,This is by far the worst game ever! I rented it thinking it was going to be a pirate fighting action game but I was wrong! You don't even get to move around. All you get to do is choose what action you want to do and most of the time it doesn't even work. What ever you do don't buy or rent this game. SAVE YOUR MONEY!
3,Could have been much better.,"The game isn't bad, it's just the same as the other 3. I didn't expect it to be groundbreaking. But some change, some advancment in the concept of the adventure game genre would have been nice. But in the end there really wasn't. It follows the same format, the same ideas and just didn't strike me as being very new. Especially after all the hype Lucas arts pumped before it's release. All said and done it is still enjoyable."
2,Just wasnt my cup of tea.,"I think if you have the patience to figure out senseless puzzles, then this is for you.. but i really dont see the point of a game that you MUST, and believe me you MUST, but the guide to get through. A yawner for me."
3,Very disappointed !!!,"The Game doesn't worth enough to belong to Play Station 2, to much loading scene, lack of action.I'm also owned Starwars starfighter that's made me feel the same. Wonder how the press gave them a very high rate. I never buy any game from Lucas Arts no more."
1,boo!,"this game just is'nt the same. it gets very boring SOON, and the puzzles and controls can get frusterating.i don't recomend it"
1,TEEEEEERRRRRRRRIIIIIIIBBBBBBBLLLLLLLEEEEEEE!!!!,"I'm the kid who wrote the ""this is boooorrrriiinnnggg"" article on this dumb game, allow me to be more specific on my thoughts on monkey island. When I got the PS2 I decided to rent a game. So I went to Video[store] and saw Monkey Island. The cover said ""pirates, Adventure, and monkeys!"" Under that I read ""We need more games like this"" I thought ""cool"" and rented it. When I got home I started to play, it when I started the game I saw that the character's name was Guybrush Thweepwood... I found myself tied up and didn't know what to do. When I figured it out I found myself trying to stop this guy from destroying my house. I walked around and went to this ""Scumm Bar building"" and talked to people. Now I looove Rpg's so I liked talking to people but I had to ask questions? BOORINNNG! I couldn't get ""grog"" so he got Kudu jerky pretzels[yuck]! Let me put it this way, this game is 100% [bad], but I DO have a pro on it, the graphics are nice."
4,Escape From Monkey Island,"This game just didn't live up to the other 3 previous games. The graphics were great, but the puzzles were complicated and incredably illogical. I often found myself asking, what is the point? The dialogue was good, but sometimes kind of repetitive. They had somewhat of a good idea for a plot, but it went awry. I'm glad I only rented this game and didn't waste too much money."
5,Rich Rossini,"There are only two interpreters of Rossini you should have, and this is one of them (at least in digital). Abbado knows what he's doing, and Berganza is as sweet a soprano as you'll find. Love the ensemble, pitter-pat singing as well. Can't go wrong here."
4,Good tool,"This is definitely a handy item. I have only recently had hand problems, so it is tough to adjust, but after months of fumbles, strains, and sprains of my fingers and hands trying to do what I used to do, I gave up and bought this. It makes it so easy now to open many items with ease. I wish it came with a belt loop holder to keep it on me all the time. In the past I would have made myself one, but can't do that anymore.This item was so great I have bought one for friends and family members who also have the same problems I do."
5,Read this!,So interesting and makes complete sense to me. Why isn't the medical industry teaching such basic ways to take care of your self? Money! They want cancer patients.So book is not long and reads very easy. I plan on passing it around my family
5,Fear Cancer NO MORE!,This is a quick and easy informative read. Its obvious we can ALL avoid a cancer diagnosis by living a life this book describes! I recommend this book to any and all.
1,Three DVDs Blank,"As others stated, the first DVD is fine, the next three all blank. Very disappointing and unprofessional, if not downright cheating."
4,Ummm...Decent,"Pros:- Light- Allows you to acquire iron sights on your 10/22 while having a scope mounted- Medium-High mounting allows for scopes with a wide frontCons:- I'm not a fan of each ring having 4 screws to hold the scope. It's probably more stable/lighter that way versus 1 thick piece with only 2 screws, but I didn't like having to place 8 screws to just mount the scope- As you can see in the picture, one of the screw holes can only be accessed by feeding your screwdriver through the hole in the upper section, thus limiting how robust of a screwdriver you can use on that screw. This, I'm fairly confident, lead to a subpar mounting job and my rings eventually came loose and the scope started wobbling. Had to go out and buy a new screwdriver and some blue locktite to do the job rightNot as sexy/flexible as mounting a picatinny rail with weaver rings, but it is lighter and you can acquire iron sights through them."
5,good as it gets for over/undersights,"good as it gets for over/undersights. I got these for my 10/22 and they were better than I expected. Slapped a scope on the top, zeroed in and she's ready. I would definitely order them again if I need more of them in the future."
4,"Not the prettiest, but works","All I wanted was a good fit for my scope on my 10-22 that also allows me to use the iron sights. These work perfectly. Installation took longer than necessary because you really need to find a long and extremely narrow screwdriver to tighten one of the screws on each ring due to the design. Other than that, it works, holds my scope tight and allows me to use the iron sights."
5,Just like having Robocop it self,"Just perfect; highly detailed, it's just like having Robocop it self in your room. It's heavy and compact; more than a toy, it's a piece of art in which you can feel the effort that manufacturers invested on it.To say the truth, I felt a little disappointed when I first turned it on to get it talking, because it started to talk like a parrot out of control. Then I realized that it talks when it detects movement in front of it.That's a great quality that will let any adult enjoy this toy like my whole family and grown friends do now; just as if they were kids again.Thank you Neca."
5,Issac Hayes,"Live at the Sahara Tahoe by Isaac Hayes is one of Mr. Hayes's better outings, the only problem for me is the songs are way too short, great disk, I miss him and his music a lot."
4,Isaac Hayes lLive......WOW!,"He sounds good live as well as in the studio. one thing...i wish he did more of his material.overall, a great set. :)"
4,HEAVY DUTY MONSTER ROCK!,"Unpretentious,Heavy,Full of cool riffs.Yes,Grand Magus does it again.As good as the self- titled Grand Magus.100% better than any so called new rock bands.Shades of Black Sabbath,yes,but these cats have theyre own style.Im glad theres still bands who havent forgotten what it means to rock.Buy this CD.Thanks for your consideration.Stomp"
5,Thanks!,"I am actually the author/artist of this book. I have illustrated over eighty books but this is my favourite one, probably because I enjoyed working on it so much. I went to my sister's farm in Zimbabwe with another story in mind, but tossed it aside and did this one in a heightened moment of inspiration, much to the concern of my editor in New York. I want to thank the private Amazon reviewers for their enthusiasm. It is is still selling well, although was initially received without much fanfare from the editorial reviewers when it came out eleven years ago. Time Magazine chose it as one of their ten favourite children's books of the 1994."
4,Almost perfect,"This little sink looks fantastic and was very easy to install. It has a subtle warm/soft feel to it (compared to a metal or ceramic sink) that you may or may not like.The only downside is that water doesn't drain out of it quite like it does from a metal or ceramic sink (higher surface tension with the acrylic I suppose?), so you can end up with some small puddles in the bottom of the sink. If your water has a high mineral content and these puddles are left to evaporate, you may end up with visible deposits left in the bottom of the sink. If you use the sink often (or just wipe it out occasionally) then it shouldn't be an issue."
4,Awesome Star Wars,Got this for my grandson who is really into Star Wars of all types big time...he was thrilled that I was able to find this Droid for him. He's collecting all the Droids of different sizes and types. This was a great buy.
2,"OK, except for one HUGE flaw","At a first glance, this is a good mouse just because it's wireless and optical. It's comfortable, and the scroll wheel is just smooth enough. Unfortunately, it has one big problem which forced me to return the mouse and exchange it for the far super Logitech MX700 mouse. The problem is this: the mouse falls asleep if you leave it alone for a minute or so, and then you have to move it quite a bit before it wakes up. So, whenever you want to move the mouse after leaving it alone for a bit, it just doesn't respond for several seconds. This is incredibly annoying. So I wouldn't recommend this one."
2,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING,My daughter loves Miley Cyrus so we ordered this DVD. She couldn't wait until she got it in the mail.She did not like it at all and never watched it again. She usually watches Miley Cyrus dvd's over and overand over again.
1,Bootleg,"The audio was so bad it was static over level 3. The rest was copies of other sources of interviews of Miley, from filming a TV. The only new material was asking kids what they thought of Miley. This was not even at a concert. If you like wasting money, buy this."
3,Chicago Metallic 4-Piece Toaster Oven Set,Love this product except that the muffin tin won't fit into my toaster oven. It's just too long. My friend got the same product and her's does not fit either.
3,Muffin Pan Too Large,I got this set primarily for the muffin pan but it is too large for my Black & Decker under cabinet toaster oven. The pans are a nice quality. I was disappointed but the muffin pan can still be used I just won't save on electricity when using it.
4,Just OK,"Pans match price paid in quality....They definatly fit in the smallest of toaster ovens. Cake pan is folded at corners so expect it might rust sooner than other two. Like that it has a roasting rack....perfect for small meatloaf or 2 medium chicken breast etc. Muffin pan surprised me a bit, quality seems better than cake pan----heavier than other two. Cookie sheet fits two slices of bread, nothing more. Over all I'm happy with purchase."
1,cake pan rusted before 1st use,"The packing says it is dishwasher safe, but the cake pan was rusted in the corners after the first washing before I ever used it. If you call Chicago Metallic for the 25 year warranty you will have to pay to ship it to them and IF they determine it's defective, they will mail you a new one (which would probably rust too). Will be trying to return this to the store - hopefully they will take it back."
1,rusted,"The construction of the roast pan is ridiculous. Picture folding paper into a roast pan, (think origami)that is what they did but with a sheet of metal instead of paper. Food and whatnot can get into the folds. I washed it anyway, thought I would try it, and it started to rust. I returned it."
4,good,"So far so good. My toaster oven only came with one shallow pan. This helps out quite a bit. I don't think I've used my oven since. When it's just one person, the toaster oven is the way to go."
3,"Decent set, but...","Muffin pan is too big. Even tried it in our older, bigger toaster oven & a friends even bigger one...the flared sides make it not fit. Disappointed, that's why there's are 3 stars, as I use the muffin tin for so much more than muffins. The nonstick is great & holding up to a daily batch of parmesan cheese crisps after 2 weeks, so that's a win."
2,Cookie pan warps at low temperature,"I was optimistic when I received these pans, as they seemed well made and the materials were quite sturdy. The size of the pans was great. They would fit perfectly in my toaster oven. However, the first time I used the cookie sheet at 325F, the pan warped. I did not expect this, as the pan feels quite thick and has a weight to it. Also the wire rack that can be used in either the cookie sheet or the cake pan rocks when placed in either pan. I have not used the other two pans (muffin tin and cake pan as of yet, so I can't comment on how they react to heat."
3,"Nice set but does not fit Panasonic NB-G110P Flash Xpress Toaster Oven, Silver",This set came up as a recommended purchase of the Panasonic NB-G110P Flash Xpress Toaster Oven but the cupcake pan does not fit inside the above oven the other two pans do fit. It probably should not come up with that oven. Other than that it looks like a nice pan set. Just know if you but it with the above listed oven the cup cake pan will not fit in it. If it did fit I would have been a 4 star at least..
3,not sure if I like it yet,"I bought these to go in my toaster oven. However, I have not used them yet. But the cupcake pan to not fit. I was a little disappointed about that. If the ends was flat instead of round they probably would have fit."
5,Can't beat 'em!,"When they say non-stick, they mean non-stick. Easy clean up, even baking, just the right size. Haven't been disappointed during the many times we've used them."
4,Exactly what I was looking for,"The pans are exactly what I was looking for, just wish they were bigger for my large size toaster oven."
4,Nice sturdy set..,"This set is as nice as the many postive reviews have stated it is. I love the non-stick finish and have had no problems with it (but I do handwash these peices -- this takes no time, it is very easy to clean). I have a convection toaster oven that fits a 12"" pizza. The reason I have given this product four stars is that the cookie sheet slightly bows dependinging on how long I have it in the oven -- this doesn't happen every time I use it. The muffin pan is great and fits perfectly. If I could change anything about this set I would make the cookie sheet a little larger -- the pan that came with my oven is 9.5 x 10.5 where as this pan is much smaller. Over all a great set for the money."
4,"Nice pans, but sizes slightly different than listed","I just received this set, so I don't know how they'll do over time, but the pans seem like they're pretty high quality. However, the actual sizes are slightly different than the ones listed in the description:Cookie pan: 10 1/4"" x 7 1/4"" (rim), 9"" x 5 1/2"" (baking surface)Cake/roast pan: 10"" x 6 7/8"" (rim), 9 1/8"" x 6"" (bottom of pan), 1 3/4"" (height)Muffin pan: 11 1/2"" x 7 1/4"" x 1 1/4""Sadly, because of the unnecessary curved lips on the end, the muffin pan is slightly too long for my toaster oven, which is why I took off one star. :("
3,made well,nice coating.. well made.. if i had to change anything. it would be the broiler..should be made with slits instead of the grill to keep the splash from contacting the heating coils and possibly starting a fire. could not find one this size. so is the best ive come accross.
5,Chicago Metallic Non-Stick 4-Piece Toaster Oven Set,"These small pans are really heavy, well made, and a correct size for most counter-top toaster ovens.They distribute the heat well, and are terrific for small meals, breads, and baked deserts. Most of my(large) standard kitchen speciality baking pans are great, but I wouldn't mind if they were this easy to use.These little ""guys"" are considerably nicer than I expected, ... and they arrived very soon after they were ordered."
3,Disappointed,"After the great reviews, I was excited to try these. Unfortunately, for me, they aren't any better than the less expensive pans. The first time I used the baking sheet, it warped when it became hot in the oven (and then flattened back as it cooled). Good baking sheets will not do this. I have not tried the other two pans, but am longer in a hurry to try them out."
4,Great Pans,These pans are great for my toaster oven with the exception of the cupcake pan which did not fit in my regular sized toaster oveb. I had one soaking for a day and it did not rust in the least bit. I would highly reccomend these pans if you have the right sized toaster oven for them.
5,Ideal accessory for our new Cuisinart TOB-40 Custom Classic Toaster Oven Broiler!,This is a must with any toaster oven! Easy to use. Easy to clean. easy to store! I would definitely recommend!
4,great but...,The Chicago metallic non-stick 4-piece toaster oven set are good and sturdy but the muffin pan didn't fit in my toaster oven. The other items fit great. I guess the muffin pan goes out in the yard sale. I'll keep looking for right size muffin pan for my toaster oven.
3,Wouldn't buy again,"They sort of do what they are supposed to, but they don't last. After using them only 6 months they are already beyond cleaning. And I only use them in a very limited way, never above 375 degrees. Dishwasher safe and 25 year warranty labeling led me to expect more. These are still in once piece true, but I've never even put them in a dishwasher and already their is discoloration and what I can only describe as a film on them that I can't wash off. And the corners on the grill pan (the one 2 inches deep) are impossible to clean out. I have to wonder what people are cooking on these that makes them like them so much. I'm mostly reheating pizza slices or baking chicken or veggies in a little olive oil. I bought some non-stick pans with only a 1 year warranty, and they seem to be washing completely clean just fine, so not sure what is wrong with these pans."
2,You get what you pay for.,"While these pans are a perfect size for use with a toaster/convection oven, they rust. Let me say that again. Here, in the 21st century, these baking pans rust. Just like cookware did in the 19th c. I will confess that I don't have a dishwasher so I allow the pans to air dry. This was probably a mistake. In my defense, no other piece of cookware that I own rusts...at all. Now the pans all have unclean-able rust stains throughout. They're still useable, you just have to get used to the brown spots that won't go away. Personally I think buying a little more up-market product would be worth consideration."
4,very good but muffin tin does not fit in my oven,"I'm not sorry I bought this, but the muffin pan is too big for my toaster oven. So that was very disappointing. so if you can do with the roaster and small broiler pan this is great. don't know why they had to oval shape the muffin tin."
2,Waste of money,"I bought the pan set for the Panasonic Flash Xpress Toaster Oven. First of all, the muffin pan does not fit in the oven even though Amazon put it together. Also, the flat pan barely fit in the oven. The pan warped and I threw it away. I think I still have the cake pan."
2,Cookie sheet begins to warp after minimal use,"I am sad to say that I am very disappointed with this item. So far I have only used the cookie pan, but I've used it about two dozen times over the course of about 2 months (mostly to make baked bacon, which is awesome by the way). It was great because it was so easy to clean, I was really happy with it. Now it's suddenly warping when exposed to heat in the oven, even at low temperatures (250-300 degrees). Opposite corners of the sheet start to curl towards each other, rendering it unusable.I'm not going to return the product yet because it's possible the other items won't behave this way, and I'm looking forward to making muffins. But I'm really disappointed in the cookie sheet."
5,Good Decision ...,"I am really thrilled w/ this purchase..Perfect sizes, great quality. So happy that i can use these not only in the toaster oven, but in my reg. ovens. I wanted to order an additional muffin tin, But the one you can oder individually, is Not the same as the one in the set..Would highly recommend this set though."
4,Nice set of pans,These are nice pans for the money. I purchased them to go with the toaster oven I puchased for my parents. I used to be able to find these sets in the stores. Now all I could find were single pans to be purchased individually which made them more expensive. I can always find what I need on Amazon.
4,This is heavy duty but not high quality,I am torn on this one. It will grab hold of a pipe and do the job well. It is just that it seems like it was made in 1925 and repackaged to sell today. It seems like it is made out of cast iron. It was different than what I expected.
3,A nice Christmas story,"Long ago I watched this and loved it. I was very young and I guess times changed and the movie now is nice, but a bit corny too. It is a lovely story, but in todays world it would need a lot of polish and better writting. Timothy Bottoms was not as good as you would want him to be. Marie Osmond was surprisingly wonderful. If only she would go back to acting. It makes you wonder what she'd be like today. She was very young making this movie and very good at it."
4,When I fall in love....,"When I fall in love, I want it to be with the same passion that Beth and Rudy share. To love someone so much that you would give up your most prized possession, that is love. They make you truly believe that money doesn't buy happiness. Love does. How can you watch this movie and not have a hanky ready. I have loved this movie for years and will do so until the day that I die."
5,A Very Great Movie!,This is Lisa!I like this movie .My favorite one in the movie his James Woods.James Woods is great on this movie!
2,Only OK,"Pretty fluffy, slow, and trite story line. The costumes were exquisite and the sets nicely done. I would not recommend the film to my friends, however."
4,Classic Christmas Romance,I saw this film way back when it first aired and loved it. Both leads are perfectly convincing as a charming couple in love.I highly recommnend this to anyone looking for a sweet classic romantic film.
5,Gift of Love,"This is a true classic and a must have for every household, regardless the format you may require. This shows the true meaning of LOVE and SACRIFICE how priorities will give us a cvhance to ""walk the talk""."
4,A Wild and Crazy Guy!,"What a wild and crazy guy! What is really nice about Steve Martin is that he is funny without being vulgar and charms with his enthusiasm. As an artist and a person, he hasn't grown into cocaine or freebasing, but into a person most people would find talented and level headed. He has done the things that many comedians dream to do, stand up, movies, TV and writes books. He is not the greatest comedian who ever lived or among the greatest but might make a big impact by steadly growing as an artist and not crashing and burning into flames. This album is a classic of Stever Martin during his stand-up and Saturday Night Live days. He was there when it was new and great and so was he. He still is very good and reliable."
3,Hit and Miss,"I love some of Steve's movies and decided to give his stand-up a go. Well...it's occasionally funny. The material is a bit dated, too.And maybe it's just this one album, but there are moments of alarm when Steve sounds like he is very much in love with himself; that ""I-am-so-cool-don't-I-sound-cool?"" vibe which is utterly pretentious and self-indulgent.I dunno...give it a shot and listen for yourself. I'll check Steve's other comedy albums 'cause there are promising signs of some great stand-up material, which, I am sorry to say, is thinly scattered here."
2,Does some good pickin' and a grinnin'!,"Steve Martin has become a cultural staple in the comic community. With hysterical films and outlandish Saturday Night Live performances, it would be obvious that Martin would be a great choice to do a comic album. Well, in this film guys opinion, you are going to need to be a big fan of Martin to stomach this album. His humor is offbeat, never quite following a pattern or direction. Instead of actual jokes, he resorts to making noises on the album that I am sure are funny in person, but listening to it just comes off a failure. His ""Cat Handcuffs"" bit is humorous, but the rest becomes obvious that somebody was looking to cash in on Martin's popularity. I would have loved to see Steve Martin in concert during his younger days, I am sure that he would make me laugh my socks off, but it just doesn't translate well to day's style. I am sorry Steve, but I liked your other album better.Grade: ** out of *****"
2,"Not so hot... sorry to all fans, but this sounds tired","My apologies to all those who respect and like Steve Martin - please do not take it personally. To me, there are some stand artists who are good, and there are some who have reached the status of Holy Cows. You cannot touch them without invoking an avalanche of ""NOT HELPFUL"" button-clicks (watch this space folks!). To me, in this Hall of Tired and Not So Funny Humor there is Monty Python, Robin Williams and yes - Steve Martin.I do not think Steve Martin is even a good actor. He is as one-dimensional in his on-screen act as he is in his stand-up performances. Some of the jokes might have been funny 25 years ago, today they are just sad. Incidentally, he shares the same sad charcteristic with Robin Williams: for the poor quality of writing they compensate with a ""charged"" performance.Give me something else, please - because not all good things get better with time. Some things might have been so-so, but now they have positively gone sour."
5,A WILD AND CRAZY CD!!!!,"This is one of the best, no the VERY BEST Steve Martin work from my point of view. I recently gotten ahold of A Wild and Crazy Guy CD and it brought back some very veeeerrrry funny memories from when it first came out in 1978. I was very young and to this day, I still hear King Tut rolling in my head. I can't go anywhere without hearing this on my headset and not laugh myself silly walking down the street to which people may think I'm crazy. This is a good CD to have if you favor people other than Eddie Murphy, George Carlin, or Richard Pryor among others."
3,Rare Xmas Treasure,"""WHAT DO THE LONELY DO AT XMAS"" is an R&B holiday classic. That hard-to-find track is worth the price of the CD. Why it's not included in an of the Emotions ""BEST OF ..."" collections is beyond me! The song has that aching, tender appeal of the old-school girl-groups like the Supremes and the Marvellettes."
3,What Do The Lonely Do At Christmas,"I have finally found it. I have searched high and low for years for this one song. It it well worth the price of the CD. Now I can hear it all year round, as opposed to the holiday season only."
1,Just too perfect,"Wow i could not believe how perfect the main female character was in this story. She could clean to perfection, cook exceptionally well, decorate homes and offices, didnt need much sleep, could perform vet tech. help during surgery (without training no less), and was a marvel with all animals. I must admit that Saint Laura is... well I just have no words for this character.STAY AWAY unless you want to be bored to absolute tears."
4,Insightful book...,This is the first book I have read from this author and now I want to read the whole series! I thought this book was very insightful into the life of someone was has had brain damage and the troubles they face everyday. The storyline was very believeable and I really enjoyed the characters. It's nice to have a storyline where the main characters don't immediately jump into bed. I really liked this book and hope you read it and enjoy it too!
5,My Review 3,"Love all books of the Coulter Family. Love how Ms. Anderson creates her characters and inter twines them with people disability issues, that's life and it happens and we all deserve love. Thanks so much!"
3,Not what it used to be,"I just recently bought a few cans of Progresso Minestrone soup and I have to say it is nothing like what I remember it being like years ago. I used to love eating this soup and used to fight over it with my siblings. It used to taste homemade and now it tastes like it came from a can. I'm not really happy with it at all.. I don't know why they had to change it, but I miss the original taste of Progresso's minestrone."
4,Good easy meals - with veggies,"A little on the high sodium side but good quick meals with veggies and good stuff in them. Ordered the Minestrone, Lentil and Veggie"
4,Hearty and flavorful,Nicely seasoned. I eat this for lunch at work and find it quite satisfying. I get a 6-pack once a month via Subscribe and Save.
3,"Tasty, but...","I like this soup, BUT I think for my preference the broth is a little thick and salty. The penne was few and far between and the filler was mainly beans. BUT it was alright anyway."
4,One of their best veggie soups,"I like soup because it's easy, pretty healthy and filling. I'm a vegetarian and this is my favorite veggie flavor of theirs. Lots of the soups that seem vegetarian have chicken broth so my choices are limited but I like this one a lot. The only problem is, why is a cup listed here as 110 calories? On the 2 serving cans I buy at the store it says 100 calories per serving. I'm confused. Regardless, it's not fantastic but I dont know who's expecting it to be. For a canned soup with no meat it tastes good."
5,Great encouragement for Mommies,"I have enjoyed reading through this after the birth of all my babies. The first few months are difficult with the new changes, but reading from other mommies who have been there is very encouraging. Most important of all, letting the Scripture that is all throughout the book be an encouragement as God is our very present help."
1,Buyer beware! This is the worst.,"There is nothing good about this movie except for the title. Bad acting excuse me, atrocious acting. Terrible special effects. And the main problem, at 3 hours, it's way too long.I had to force myself to watch it to the end. At least ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" is bad funny. This movie is just pathetic. I gave it 1 star simply becasue Amazon does not have a no star or a minus start. If you want to watch it then RENT IT. Please don't waste your money."
1,H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds,"Has got be one of the worst films I have ever seen! Poorly acted, Strange lighting and some of the worst special effects I think I have ever seen. I've seen better on Playstation 1 intros and thats no exaggeration. Strongly reccomend not to buy this film. Wish I hadn't but entirely my mistake for not reading all the other reviews stating how bad it really was. You have been warned!!"
1,waste of time,"i don't know what they were thinking in this movie. i couldn't believe how low budget this one was. they shouldn't have even tried. i was laughing so hard at the computer animation that i truely believe this should have been a comedy. this litterally looks like one of those movies you used to see on mystery science theatre all except for the opening t*tty scene. that was probably the highlight of the flick. after that just was as the ""actors"" attempt a crapfest right from the beginning. this shouldn't even be considered a b movie. try c or d movie. i am glad blockbuster has unlimited rentals or i would be p*ssed about getting this one.i tell you this much, if this movie is faithful to the book, then i am gonna forget about reading the book."
2,this is movie worse than horse M3$#@ure,"Oh My, Read my other review please. I just can't keep going on and on about how this movie SUCKS ASS!!!.[...]The joke is on anybody who really wants to watch 3hrs of war of the the worlds. If you want great War Of the Worlds movies see the the one from 1953 or see Steven Spielbergs version! Please don't waist your money on this pile!!!!!!!!!!!11IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"I love bad movies, and had to return this one.","There are B movies you can watch and laugh with, and then there are movies like this. My DVD collection is FILLED with bad movies (Including my most recent purchase, with the actor playing Gimli on a cruise ship stalked by... the Chupacabra!!!). I LOVE bad movies. This movie is so bad Mike, Joel and the bots would beg for back to back Manos Hands of Fate instead.This movie is LONG (heck the only thing that gets me through most bad movies is that they're 90 minutes or less!), special effects WORSE than any straight to video movie I've seen recently, and acting worse than your average pornographic film. There is nothing redeeming about this film. It was only a $8 and some change at my local store... and I returned it. If a movie about a Chupacabra on a cruise ship is still in my collection and this isn't, it must tell you something =o)"
4,You will probably enjoy this movie.,"Thinking of WAR OF THE WORLDS?You will probably enjoy this movie if:* You have ever wondered what Dorothy would have done if Martians came down from space and ate Aunty Em.* You like David Lynch movies.* You never missed a Farscape episode, but don't tell anyone.* You like women in lace and young cuties with curls.* You appreciate a good sense of humor as well as dramatic teary-eyed scenes."
4,Arrogance gets you in the end.,"Set in the original book time of the eighteen hundreds, this is a Victorian story of arrogance and contented indifference and how these traits lead to disaster. The lead guy is humbled and broken and returns to his family forever changed and atoning in the face of God's plan and ultimate defeat of the Martians. An excellent family movie."
3,Follows the book pretty closely but............,"This version of War of the Worlds follows the original book fairly closely. The special effects are good in some parts and terrible in others. The acting for the most part is not bad. As stated by so many others the blue screen shots are extremely bad in some parts. I bought this movie at Walmart for $8 which is the equivelent to one ticket to the movies so hey, what do you have to lose. $8 I say. Renting it would be a viable option too. One interesting point is the moustache that the main character has. It looks pretty well pasted on and the guy goes through weeks of hell evading the aliens and never even has a five o'clock shadow by the end of the movie. I guess he brought along a straight razor and some shaving cream so he would look good for the ending. LOL I also agree with the Thunder Child assesment: It looks like a toy boat in a bath tub. Oh well....."
3,You got it coming Hines!!!,"Personally I don't have anything against Martians.But if they ever see this we are in BIG trouble, yep if they ever land the soul purpose will be to hunt you down mate.To be honest yes the acting is bad (one of the actress's expression wouldn't change even if you hit it with a sledge hammer) and use of cgi just got way out hand.It's labour of love, with loads of enthusiasm and some talent.The old saying comes to mind ""Bad films aren't made, they just happen"".All hail the new Ed Wood.Better luck next time!!!!"
2,Flawed but Watchable,"This version of War of the Worlds is obviously done on a budget. The cast act against a bluescreen backdrop, which can be a little diconcerting at times. It also seems to me that the spoken words tend to go out of synchronisation with the picture at certain stages. Having said all that it does hold true to the book and is not a bad film, certainly watchable for a rainy Sunday afternoon. Don't expect an Epic or quality acting, but if you want simply be entertained then this film is just fine."
4,This was a breathtaking movie.,This was a breathtaking movie.Favorite scenes:The astronomer Ogilvy discovers the meteorite at the pit.The first Artilleryman battle with the martian fighting machines on Horsell Common.The battle at Shepperton.The meteorite smashes into a house.All the scenes in the collapsed kitchen.The Narrator offers himself to a martian fighting machine.A handler machine stumbles into a house exploding it.
4,I'm happy with this one.,"First few times I saw this movie I thought some scenes could be cut shorter. I still feel this way, but due to my son's interest in this movie we have seen it several times. This movie seems to be more fun to watch each time I view it, and Anthony Piana is an extraordinary actor.The martians and the fighting machines are fascinating, and there are no other movies that cover them like this one. All the victorian settings and manners are extremely well done."
3,Nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be.,"I've just watched this movie, having read all the bad press about it. Sure, it's never gonna trouble the Spielberg version in anyway, yes some of the acting is questionalble, some of the effects are laughable. However...It's only a movie,And a damn enjoyable one at that.Keep an open mind and you'll spend the best part of 3 hours watching HG Wells story faithfully coming to life before your very eyes. My whole family had a great time watching this film and found it just as (if not more) entertaining than the Spielberg or Asylum versions.I even enjoyed the score.The only bad points were:-The editing.The Thunderchild sequence (fair dues...this was abysmal).Dead London (they forgot the London bit).Buy this movie, it deserves a place on your shelf."
4,My opinion.,directing - a strength - 9acting - solid - 9costumes - fitting - 10art direction - pretty good - 8special effects - hit and miss - 8soundtrack - great - 10editing - 9I think I really liked the movie for telling the complete story of War of the Worlds. Some of my favorite parts of the book made it in the movie and I really liked that. I think the movie is a good movie to see.
4,Had a great time.,"My bro and I had a great time watching this movie. It ain't Shakespeare but it's fun for a night and totally under priced.Best parts: too many to list. Worth the price for the whole bit at the pit with the giant meteor. Next best, the Martians striding all over the place, picking up people, throwing people--awesome!--spider machines, blowing away everyone, the main writer dude beating the sh*t out of the curate.Low parts: it's really a miniseries calling itself a movie. It's more like two movies. It's obviously cornball cgi at times, specially on the road with the elfinstones.Total sum: the good outways the quirky four sure.Check it out."
3,Good movie.,"This is probably the most quirky movie out there this year. You have to see it to see if you love it or not. I loved it to the tune of 4 stars.The acting is superb, all the characters are very likeable and there is plenty of destruction. The dialogue from Wells' book is terrific. Many lines are instantly memorable. They jump out at you. Can you imagine this movie could actually inspire people to actually read the book War of the Worlds?The setback is the budget. Obviously they struggled to make this movie. It's HUGE and almost three hours long with special effects everywhere. The CGI falls short here and there. Know its there and ignore it. The story is the best.Buy this movie and buckle up for a bumpy but enjoyable ride."
3,"Good yes, but not for me.","Though I was disappointed that this film did not contain nudity and adult themes as described, I enjoyed it very much. It was more like Ang Lee's Sense & Sensibility which was also very good. Just not what I was looking for. But for English drama it was good."
2,"Right century, wrong quality","its a treat to see this H.G. Wells classic presented as it was meant: 19th century England fighting Martians. However, the jerkiness of the DVD transfer (missing frames, poor frame rate...whatever) makes it unwatchable. A pity as the design of the martians and their huge walkers was very creative in this version. Let's hope its re-released on a higher quality pressing."
1,Don't bother,"This production is so amateurish I thought it may have been made by 1st year students!Don't waste your money, this film is bl*&dy; awful!You have been warned."
1,I gave 1 star because I couldnt give any less.,"This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. Terrible acting, too long, special effects that were far from special or effective, just terrible. I have bought and viewed many movies but this is the first time that I have been motivated to write a review. I find it hard to beleive that anyone would release this movie as anything other than a joke. If I could have given no stars I would have."
1,Very Disappointing,"Decided to get this film as an alternative to the latest blockbuster. This film is true to the original book, and set in the same time period. Unfortunately that is where the similarity ends, as this is so badly made it makes you cringe. Firstly the acting is terrible, and it is all to apparent the none of the actors are english. Their accents are reminiscent of Dick Van Dyke in Mary popppins. The CGI special effects are laughable, and the film has this annoying orange hue throughout.I dodnt finish watching the film, and quite frankly it was a waste of good money. My advise is dont bother."
1,Like gay porn with all the sex taken out,"This really looks like Tim Hines decided to make a gay porno version of H.G. Wells book but at the last minute took all the sex out in the mistaken belief he'd made a proper movie. It bears a passing resemblance to the novel, but it's full of weird gay undertones. The hero looks like Freddie Mercury and spends much of the second half with his shirt off holding down a `nice' looking young priest from behind. If that's your idea of suitable family entertainment, fine, but be warned that this is not exactly the `straight' adaptation the box promises. Even if you're fine with the gay content, bear in mind this boasts porno level acting, direction and storytelling - in other words non-existant - with the worst movie effects ever."
1,Amazing they have the nerve to sell this,This film is so bad you cannot believe that anyone would release it. It doesn't even look started let alone finished. The film seems to be a raw assembly with no real editing. The special effects are all unfinished. The photography is terrible. The acting is much worse. Even the moustaches are fake and falling off. And there is a very odd gay vibe through the whole film that I doubt was in the novel. If Spielberg did not have a film coming out this year there is no way any sane person would ever put this out. But obviously the people of this film have no more shame than they have talent.
1,The Gift That Says...,"The one gift to give when you want to tell someone ""I hate you"". Really, this was just such a poorly done waste of time. Just terrible! I only paid $10.00 for it, and I STILL feel like I got ripped off. Shot on video (and it looks it) with student-grade special CGI effects, this film is the ""Plan 9 From Outerspace"" of our time...no wait, I take that back. ""Plan 9"" is too good a film in comparison to insult by grouping it in with this piece of rubbish. I spent half the time fast forwarding through the horrible acting and the main character running around the back woods as he constantly tripped and fell in panic. Seriously, I had my DVD player set on x16 and the scenes still lasted like 10 minutes each!! Do yourself a favor and pass on this one. I'd rather be hit by a heat ray then have to sit through this one again."
3,Kick in the pants fun.,"This is just a good ol' kick in the pants fun Martians invade Earth story. Good fighting, good hand combat in the dust, sexy women, love story and handsome shirtless hunk for your girl. The downside is it's long and you'll have to empty the fuel tank in the middle. Word to the wise, do it early so you don't break the flow of the flick. Upside is it's just dang cool and creepy, with great cannon fire and martian annihilation."
1,One-Hundred-Eighty Minutes...wasted,Keep a good book or a stack of old magazines handy while watching this movie.
1,Why waste words? It's the pits!,"If you want to waste three hours of your life on this excretia, just beware that -1. It's not a proper movie. It's shot on a clockwork webcam2. It's not even funny3. It only has the boring bits from the book4. It goes on forever5. You can get the same effect by watching flies buzzing around roadkillThis is like someone who aspires to be as good as Ed Wood but isn't even that good. Boring to the max!"
1,Bakshi as Hines mentor?,"Ummmmm--so why did all the previous reviews for this product disappear? Perhaps Pendragon complained about the overwhelmingly negative reviews.I bought this movie at Wal-Mart; as a professional-quality movie it is a disaster. The cinematography borders on the bizarre (veering from night to day and back again in the same action sequence--very reminiscent of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space""). The CGI is the quality of that found on an early 90s video game; the acting is distinctly amateur and the script atrocious. This movie reminded me of Ralph Bakshi's ""Lord of the Rings' cartoon of the 1980s--it has the same unfinished, hastily-edited look.I gave this 2 stars in the review that seems to have been removed from Amazon. On further reflection, I think that 1 is warranted."
2,Ouch!!!,"Oh, I am not saying this DVD is bad, but it is worse than that awful Van Gogh VHS my sister-in-law got me for Christmas at the dollar store because it was on sale. That is not to say there were no good moments.The repititious screen saver like animation was mildly amusing as was the stilted dialogue. The screen saver stuff reminded me of ""Mary Poppins""...if ""Mary Poppins"" were blowing up... And, what about that Anglican priest? Was he comedy relief,or what? What I am saying is that someone owes me 180 minutes of my life back. I am not kidding. What really hurts the production is that had it been made a bit more badly it could have become a cult video destined to be sold for decades."
4,This is a good movie,I can't say as much as others abouth this movie. But I Liked it alot and I think others should see it.
1,"I saw it! MY EYES! OH, GOD, MY EYES!","Can a low budget feature be both astonishingly bad and hilariously pompous? The answer is yes, and the proof is this movie and the hype leading up to its release. If you want a film that can illustrate all the things you shouldn't do when making a movie (sort of a negative Filmmaking 101 course), then by all means, buy this movie. Just be sure to have your DVD player fumigated afterwards.By the way, I give this film a one-star rating since Amazon doesn't allow negative numbers."
4,H. G. WELLS' THE WAR OF THE WORLDS LIKES AND DISLIKES,What I liked:The black & white scenes of actual Victorian England at the beginning.The spooky observatory.the metorite falling with explosions.The love scenes between the narrator and his wife.the people turning into skeletons by the Martian heat ray.The battle with the Martians at Horsell Common.The heat rey blowing up everything around the narrator and his wife.The Martian tripod crashing into the church.The tripod falling into the water.The cylander hitting the house.Everything about the curate.Everything about Miss Elphinstone. ( She is soooooo cute).The Martian hadling machines.The Martian tripods.London being attacked.Big Ben blown up.The girl getting stepped on.The girl who committed suicide.The ending._____What I didn't like:Some of the pacing.Some of the special effects were rough.The refugees infront of bluescreens.Bluescreened London.The Thunderchild battle.All in all a good movie.
1,It is absolutely terrible,"I have never written a review for any Amazon product, but this movie alone inspired my frist attempt. There's not much that can be said that hasn't already been. The acting is terrible, the special effects are some of the worst ever seen by human eyes, and the movie as a whole is completely the most boring thing I have ever witnessed. The color filters of the film change between almost every seen and the fake mustache of the main character is hillarious. I didn't even finish watching the movie because I thought I might suffer an extensive ammount of brain damage. As previously stated in other reviews, its seems this movie was rushed and released to make a quick buck by confusing buyers with the Spielberg version or something to that effect. In fact, I bought this DVD on accident myself.All in all: I wanted to cut my eyes out with a rusty knife and set myself on fire because of this film (ie lump of feces)."
1,THIS FILM IS SO BAD YOUR EYEBALLS WILL BLEED,"I'm here to tell EVERYONE that all the 'Very Good!' 'Terrific!' 'Excellent!' 'I really liked this movie!!!' reviews you see here ARE PLANTED BY THE FILM COMPANY'S PRESS PEOPLE!! THE FILM IS DREADFUL. PERIOD. ANY GOOD REVIEWS WERE DONE BY PRESS FLACKS WHO ARE PAID FOR WHAT THEY WRITE. DO NOT - REPEAT - DO NOT BELIEVE ANY GOOD REVIEWS HERE - THOSE ARE THE FAKED ONES. Read all the other reviews and you'll know who is telling the truth and WHO IS A PRESS FAKE! If I had my way, I'd kick each and every one of these Moronic, Cretinous Bastards in the balls. They are paid whores. By the studio that cannot even do a decent job of production. I have seen college films by sophmore students that show more talent that this mess did."
3,A new old version of WAR OF THE WORLDS,This is a new version of WAR OF THE WORLDS. New because this movie just came out. Old because it takes place in the late 1800's when the book was written.The movie takes you on a bizarre and moving journey interweaving between a writer and his brother. The movie is slow sometimes and sometimes shocking. But all in all it was worth seeing.
1,A great shame,"This film IS a faithful dramatisation of the book, for which, as a fan I am grateful.Unfortunately it is also an example of what cannot be achieved without sufficient funding. The acting is unconvincing and the special effects, CGI work is very poorly produced. It reminds me of live action films of the fifties interspersed with Hanna Barbera cartoons, which is a pity.It just doesn't work, and even if one is a fan of the story, I would not recommend buying this film, which is a great shame."
1,Wow!,"If you are looking for one of the worst versions of ""The War of the Worlds"", you have come to the right place. This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire existence. Don't waste your money on this one. Timothy Hines has been in the movie business for 20 years? I think it's time he starts thinking of a different career."
2,If you love bad Sci-Fi movies . . .,You're gonna love this.This thing would have made H.G.Wells give up writing. The cheap effects and editing are bad enough. But a full 1/3 of the film is someone running through the woods or down the lane. The CGI tripods almost move in a stop action animation manner. Much of the special effects look like they were done for a Playstation or X-Box and the color of the film looks like an early cheap porn flick. It almost looks like the same special effects crew that did the Doctor Who television shows. The dialog is horrible. Even the main character's mustache looks fake & cheesy. AND THIS SUCKER IS 3 HOURS LONG!!!!If you are deep into Sci-fi stay away from this. But if you love really bad movie making. This movie ranks with Vampire Men from the Lost Planet for the worse Sci-Fi movie ever made. Elvira would love this thing and it cries out for Mystery Theator 3000.Watch it if you get the chance.
4,Purely Entertaining Film,"We went out and bought H.G. WELLS expecting to see a comicly bad film. We'd been hearing so-so reviews here and a lot of over-the-top slamming of the film. How funny that it turns out to be good and has style.Purely entertaining film, insanely respectful of the source material with fun visual effects and bright three-dimensional performances."
3,Good enough to put on you list.,"War of the Worlds is brimming with energy, cleverness and craft. But it remains more an abstract exercise than an all-engulfing experience."
4,Enjoyable musical movie.,"The movie is enjoyable in that the feeling of calm-before-the-storm is created so well. That made the subsequent outpouring of Martian fire power more appreciable. It also created a rhythmic, musical feeling to the whole piece. Like a grand music video."
4,Entertaining in many ways,"HG Wells The War of the Worlds is an inspired and hugely satisfying meeting of movie and novel. Not only more faithful, complex and better cast than all previous War of the Worlds, it has an essential ingredient: heart and great storylines."
4,THE WAR OF THE WORLDS in it's original setting and time.,This version of THE WAR OF THE WORLDS is set in the original 1800's time and place like the book. I loved this movie. Very different from the Spielberg version. Check it out.
1,Don't bother!,"I've been waiting for this ""true to the book"" version for over a year. I was shocked to find it had gone right to DVD without a theater release...until I watched the DVD I bought! ""Theater group"" acting and CGI that was worse than a cartoon ruins this effort. In fact, effort is the right word...it TOOK an effort to sit through this to the end! A big disappointment."
1,one word sums this up rubbish,this has to be one of the worst films ive ever seen. Ive seen student films with better CG than this. the main characters mustachelooks as if its a bit of paper that has been stuck on. and the acting is awfull. avoid at all costs.
