4,Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,"I had to watch this twice before I really loved it! I have watched it several times since! Riviting, well written!"
3,"Good acting, but movie not so great","The acting is fine, but the movie itself is boring and not great. Since, it's a true story, it might be great for documentary, but not movie itself."
3,read the book instead,"The only thing this pale, thin movie has going for it is Kevin Spacey as Jim Wiliams and Lady Chablis playing ""herself"". All the rest is merely weak imitation. Scenes that weren't in the book are included and scenes that were in the book are left out to the detriment of the movie. Savanah's incredible beauty is not filmed the way it should've been. A lot of the movie has a movie set feel to it.John Cussack is badly miscast and Alison Eastwood's presence was a mistake. I was so frustrated by the whole thing I decided to read the book again."
3,Good movie - great book!,"I was invited to see the movie when it was in the theatre. It was quite good. When it came out on audio tape, I got the tape to listen to while on a trip outwest. When the paperback finally came out, I read it - the book is wonderfully rich. The movie didn't do too bad of matching the book. Finally the video is available, and it will be in my library shortly."
1,A Great Book Shot To Hell,"This movie was an enormous disappointment.All the fun taken out of the book's deliberate ambiguity about the hero's sexuality. Lame love story introduced, Clint's daughter given a new character, and singing?I am John Cusack's biggest fan, and I love Kevin Spacey, but they are sooooo very underused.Read the book again -- you'll begrudge the 2 hours you spend watching this mess."
2,Not something for your kids.,"As usual there are the lovely Demi illustrations, but not much thought and effort was put into planning the text (once again!). This book is much too wordy, and used language too complicated and boring to connect with children. I do believe the audience for the book was supposed to be children, but I find this book cumbersome, and I may never really read it very often to my kids. You are better off with a children's bible."
4,Jesus,"Even though it was described in the description, I was not expecting the book to be as warped as it was. Does not lay flat and is really not usable."
3,"Please fix the song samples, all I hear are jazz instrumentals.","Please ignore the 3-star rating. I have to assign something. I am unable to hear the real songs. Clicking on any of the links only gets me some very ordinary live jazz instrumentals. This recording ACTUALLY comes from the Savoy Cafe in Boston, according to the announcer, who butts in on track 10, which should be the Grass Roots.ALL the samples are clearly wrong. Please fix them, Amazon. Thanks."
1,fell apart shortly after purchasing,"Our sweeper gradually fell apart over the first few months of using it. It was shabbily constructed. When I asked for a refund, they informed me that I had to mail in the defective sweeper with a check for $12.99, and they would repair or replace it."
4,Review,Awesome! Beautifully bound and good quality reproductions. Love Yoshimoto Nara and this is an affordable way to have some of his art.
1,Magnifying glass required to read date,"This is a beautiful watch for an excellent price but don't be fooled by the image on screen if you expect to use it to tell the date. I bought it specifically because I have been looking for this style tank watch with a date feature. However, it takes extremely bright light and a very good pair of glasses to read the date even when it is a single digit. When it is in double digits it is quite impossible. I have used a Seiko diving watch daily for the past 30 years and it has provided good service. I am, unfortunately, returning this tank watch immediately."
4,Neat classy watch with no clutter,"Clear dial and quiet, pleasant color scheme makes this a real nice watch. The date window is a trifle small - could be a bit bigger that would accentuate the rectangular dial - hence the 4 stars."
3,Not bad for a PCI video card,This is as good a PCI card as you will ever need. The PCI bus is so slow that there is hardly a reason to get this card this fast. However if you have a AGP slot in your computer you should *not* buy this card. You could spend less money on a much faster AGP card.
1,Not what I thought,The processor doesn't have cooler on the heatsink. It gets very very hot and smells like it's burning. The real card is diferent from the one printed on the box.
1,Not worth is,"Waste of money. The headphone out was not even a second input so i couldnt cue up tracks. Half the knobs are useless, and the outputs are so random!"
2,Bad Quality,"After reading the reviews, most were good, some were bad. I experienced everything in the bad reviews right out of the box. The background noise was disgusting, the drivers changed nothing, and believe it or not, the interface actually CHANGED the pitch I was singing! I don't understand technology too well, that much I'll admit. But after using this product, I'll go back to borrowing my uncle's M-Audio interface. This interface really, really sucked. I would not recommend it."
3,ermmmm.....,"Speedy Delivery from seller. Happy with the product, but...This comes with included software, and I have had many issues with the software, I have spent 45mins at a time on the phone to the software company, sending email too, asking questions, and receiving guidance in the installment/ registering process, it has been a hassle and it took me a month to get my small studio up and running and to be happy with the final product (my recording). The Steinberg company were very helpful, their staff are great, but I can't see why it has to be such a long process to register and get codes just to use this, if I had my chance again, I would find a better less complicated set-up. Recommended to pros, and those who know their stuff, NOT recommended to new-b's!"
1,"Lots of audio artifacts on playback, very high noise floor","on the plus side it was only $50, on the down side it sounds worse than the onboard RealTek audio on my motherboard. I'm really not sure what the target market for this device is; it fails on audio fidelity and it has inconsistent artifacts on playback. The very high noise floor on balanced outputs is also completely unacceptable."
2,High expectations,"I use a Macbook OS X 10.6.8, I have a shure SM58, and I bought this interface intending to use it with garageband.Overall, this isn't a horrible interface, however I would not suggest it for recording vocals. The gain is super low, and when raised high this squeaky sound comes out of the monitors, which I wouldn't have minded if it hadn't come up in the recordings. I attempted to plug in an electric guitar, and it came up in that recording as well. The sound prevents it from sounding like a clean, crisp, professional recording. I ended up returning it, and will shell out the extra dollars on a higher quality brand."
2,not good,"This product was defective when i got it, it respond quickly enough and the worst part is that it doesn't have phantom power aint that some BULL!!!!!!!!!!"
1,To many errors,The software that comes with this is not suitable for recording! Internally it has to many errors that occur within the program itself.
1,Arrived broken.,"I tried this because my E-MU Tracker finally went out. I didn't have much money, so I tried this one because of the price. I had heard they were pretty cheap in cost and build. The price was right, but it arrived in non-working condition. I order delicate things from Amazon all the time, and this is the first item that came defective. Maybe they are cheaply made? I don't know, but the one thing that did bother me is that when in use, I can't adjust my volume via my keyboard. I have to adjust the volume on the unit..no big deal I guess. I ended up with the M-Audio MobilePre, and it seems to be the same way. Maybe they're all like that now.. I guess i'll get used to it."
3,Not a bad little box and there's plenty of bang for the buck. Don't buy if you have a 64 bit OS though.,"This is a nice little recording box and it is powered by the usb cable so you don't need to 'plug it in'. Only problem was I could not get it to work because the one thing I am not used to thinking about when I buy hardware now is that I have a computer with Windows 7 64 bit. The more research I did, reading forums and searching Lexicon's web site, the more I was convinced there would not be a 64 bit driver forthcoming any time soon. I decided to return the Lexicon and buy a Yamaha Audiogram 6. I gave the Lexicon Alpha 3 stars because I wanted to like it but just wasn't able to use it with my computer.BUY: if you have Windows XP or Vista 32 bit.DON'T BUY: if you have Windows Vista 64 bit or Windows 7 64 bit.LESSON: If you have a 64 bit system always remember to check for 64 bit drivers before you buy any kind of hardware."
2,"Not Compatible With Windows 7, or ANY Windows 64-bit OS.","Sadly Lexicon seems to have decided that no one actually needs 64-bit support, and Windows 7 support is still nowhere in sight. This is across their entire line of products. If you have a new computer with the latest OS, then the Lexicon line of products is NOT for you. They just flat out will NOT work. If you have an old XP machine lying around that you don't plan on upgrading, then the Lexicon line of recording studio hardware has a lot of bang for the buck. Just don't purchase their products with the thought of upgrading...I'm now trying to find a similar product that supports 64-bit Windows 7.I gave this product 2-Stars because it still works great under old OS's, but I cannot give it any more Stars due to Lexicon's attitude towards 64-bit OS's, and they lackidasical approach to Windows 7 compatibility."
3,Its alright...,You get what you pay for. I wasn't expecting perfect quality because of the price and that's exactly what I got. It receives a lot of loud feed back during playback and while recording.
1,"PhotoCo, Inc. seems to be out of busienss.",You are taking huge risk by buying products from the company since you cannot expect any customer service anymore.
4,A must for the PhotoShare 7,"The PhotoShare 7 is such a great item! But, really, you need the battery to make it truly portable. When the battery runs down, simply plug the PhotoShare 7 unit into the wall and the battery will recharge while installed."
2,ill-fitting battery,"This battery is such a bad fit for the battery port of the photoviewer. The cover bulges out slightly once I was able to fit it in and connect the terminals which I think was poorly designed. Overall, not user-friendly and poorly designed."
2,Very difficult fit - due to incorrect installation instructions!,"Once installed per the directions, I found it almost impossible to reinstall the plastic battery cover. Worse, when I finally did so (with the battery's plastic cover plate bulging ominously) it caused the screen to power off. As other reviewers have noted, this appears to be a very poor physical design although the battery per se seems to work well enough. The solution however is easy - contrary to the paper directions that come with the battery, insert the battery such that the paper label on the battery is facing INWARDS (facing the innards of the machine). The photo on the battery directions shows that the paper label should be facing outwards toward the installer - this is INCORRECT! When oriented correctly, the battery fits smoothly into place and the plastic cover can be easily installed.Include me in the long list of people who think it was a rip-off that this battery was not included in the original product."
3,"Great Battery, difficult to install/remove","I found that this battery works well, it holds a charge and does all that a rechargable battery should do. I also found that getting it into the player was difficult and I felt that I might break wires in the process. I tried to remove the battery once and I almost did break the wires that connect it to the player. This is the only fault I found in the construction of this device, though it is really more about how the player connects to it..."
2,Photoshare battery,"I was shocked that the expensive Photoshare Album (PL7) I had purchased neither came with a battery nor the memory card. The battery (PSLB7) isn't available just anywhere either. I 'Googled' the battery part number (even that wasn't provided in the Photoshare instruction manual) and Amazon.com was the top search result. The price was lower than any other link, which was nice. The battery just does fit and it wasn't easy getting the cover to latch. The device works well on the battery but it doesn't seem to keep a charge for very long. The Photoshare was a gift for my wife to show off pictures of our twin grandsons and the battery doesn't last long enough for her to show her friends at church before going dead. There is absolutely no way a larger battery could fit. Tip: carry the charger/adapter and if an outlet is available--use it! Amazon.com provided quick shipping and made the purchase smooth and easy. The device has problems of its own but not the fault of Amazon.com."
2,Low Charge Retainment,"I bought this because it is hard to find this 7-pin battery, but I would not buy from this seller again.When received, this appeared to have been opened and re wrapped since it wasn't wrapped in original wrapping as shown in the picture. It did not hold a charge more than a couple hours, even though it was charged for several hours prior. I suspect it was probably USED, NOT NEW as shown in the Ad which is why the charge did not last. I charged it several times and finally gave up trying to use it because it would not hold the charge."
3,Not for me,"This works but since I am cooking for one person I find that my one or two egg omelet is just not large enough to fill the container and I come out with a scimpy looking product. However, it might work fine for those of you that use three or more eggs. I have found that the microwave just seems to make eggs that are rubbery. This is the fault of microwaving, not the produce."
5,Simple solution at a great price,"After morning exercise workouts on campus, my daughter and I need a quick breakfast that we can make with just a microwave. I was a little skeptical about whether this would work. I use non-stick spray, egg whites and fresh spinach or other ingredients and in a minute and a half we have a fresh, tasty, healthful breakfast, Clean-up is very easy (I think that might be because I use the spray) and our omelet comes out nice and fluffy. the best part is that we get to control the ingredients."
5,Great Omelet Maker,I purchased this for our grandsons to make easy and quick breakfast omelets for a warm meal before heading out the door for school. Simple instructions and easy use for kids 9 and older. The kids love it and like having a safe and easy way to fix their own breakfast and really enjoy cooking for themselves.
4,Omletter maker,This one was purchased one year back and it is still working as expected. I really loved this product and regularly uses to make hygienic and fresh omelettes in my micro ovev
5,It works great,"This little omelet maker works exactly like the ads claim. I bought it for around $5.00 and it is worth every penny I paid. I normally don't like to eat eggs, but since receiving this item approx. 2-3 weeks ago I have made Ham and Cheese omelets probably about 10 times and they come out great. No runny-whites."
5,Great for college!,"This makes really fluffy omelets! I used 2 eggs and a little milk, and followed the including timing instructions...I did turn the microwave power down though so it wouldn't overcook. It was really easy to clean and I didn't have to use any cooking spray while cooking."
2,May as well make an omelet in the frying pan,"The time it takes to make a microwave omelet took almost as long as making an omelet in the frying pan. I prefer cooking over the stove to microwave cooking any day. The taste just isn't the same. So, it's not worth the minute or two you may save making it in the microwave to me."
5,Microwavable Omelet Maker Review,Great product. Just as i remembered and does the job of a regular skillet but way less time.. Great product.
2,Find it's equal at Dollar General,I have followed the directions to the letter and have not been able to make an omelet that does not stick to the device. I know the wattage of my microwave so that's not the issue. I can get the same results from the dollar store product.
4,Pretty good omelets,"If you are looking for a convenient way to make a pretty good omelet in the morning, this thing is perfect. It won't make the greatest omelet you've ever tasted, but it's very solid especially for the amount of work required (next to none). Great for lazy people who want to cook breakfast while in the shower."
3,I prefer the taste of an omelet fryed with butter...,...to the taste that I got with this unit. Not ony the taste but also the consistency is more palatable.
5,Easy schmeezy,I am a big dork when it comes to making omelets the traditional way. This product makes it easy and fast. Love it!
3,Not equivalent to stove top omlet,"The main reason i bought this was in the hopes that it will eliminate the heat-cook-wash cycle of the pans for making omelet. While this does reduce the effort of cleaning, the omelets do not come out as well as on a regular pan. The omelet is rubbery. I have tried all different time combinations and different quantities of ingredients, still they are not so good.They are great if you are really in a hurry and can settle for a rubbery omelet.Cleaning is really easy though"
3,Still tastes like microwave eggs,Bought this after reading the many positive reviews.There is no mistaking a microwave omelet from a pan made omlet. Reminds me of the omelets served on airplanes (remember those days?).On the plus side omelets are very quickly cooked and cleanup is EZ.
3,No Skillet to Clean,This is a pretty good omlet maker although I find it a little bit difficult to get the eggs completely done without having to put it back in the microwave for more cooking several times. Clean-up is a breeze and it's nice not to have to wash a skillet.
3,An okay omelet maker,"I like the maker because it is easy to clean after use unlike when you use a regular ceramic type bowl. However, the edges of the omelet are drier and the middle doesn't get quite cooked all the way. I have a 1200 watt microwave so maybe it's a little too powerful causing uneven cooking."
5,Worth every penny,"This is my favorite kitchen ""gadget"" by far. I can easily mix up 3 eggs in a mixer, pour the egg into each side of the omelet maker and cook it for 1.5 minute. When that part is done I put a slice of cheese on each side (while it's still open) then I microwave it again for about 30 seconds.I take it out of the microwave and shut the omelet maker - cheese stays in the middle and there's no spilling. I can either eat my omelet out of the omelet maker or slide it (it really is that non-stick!) straight into a plate.It's very non-stick. I wish more things were like this. Super easy cleanup, even when the cheese spills over.Purchased a few months ago and it's still in great shape, we use it at least 5 times a week.Well worth the money!"
2,"Worth a shot for the price, but you may be disappointed","The price is right for this, so by all means check it out for yourself... you really have nothing to lose.But in my opinion, I didn't love it. The cooking times included in the instructions came nowhere close to cooking the eggs in my microwave. Also, when you get to the stage where you fold the thing closed, pretty much every single time for me the eggs just stuck to both sides and had to be scraped out when finished.And lastly, and most importantly, the eggs just didn't taste very good from this thing. Rubbery, tough, just not good.But again, a lot of people seem to like this thing, so maybe it was just my microwave and/or my preparation skills. Try it for yourself."
2,Dissappointing,"Sadly, I found this messy and without instructions for use.I gave it away. and would not recommend it to anyone."
1,I threw it away!,"This pan might be ok if you are desperate to cook some eggs and all you had was a microwave and no stove. (Like maybe a college student living in a dorm.) Otherwise, don't waste your time. The omelets taste nothing like what you make on the stove. I threw mine away because I didn't want it taking up room in my cabinet."
2,OK-,"This worked OK, but not the best. I agree with previous reviews... a pan on the stove works better and is probably just as fast, if not, faster."
3,Vile contraption,"I had one of these I purchased from a big-name retailer back in '03, as I recall. I was really excited to see this marvellous contraption on the shelf and then in my shopping cart. After using it, however, it never really got clean, even in the dishwasher. But I like omelettes, so 3 stars."
1,Great for a rubber omelet!,"No matter what or how I tried to cook it - adjusting power levels, allowing it to set just shy of being done, etc., the omelet turned out rubbery. It's up on a shelf and will probably stay there. So much easier just to get out the ol' frying pan and it tastes so much better prepared that way. And it's quicker too!"
5,great product,It works great and it is big enough for a good sized omelet. I would recommend this as a gift. It is very easy to clean up.
5,Couldn't be better!,I love this omelet maker! It is so convenient and makes a great microwave omelet. I would highly recommend it.
3,nonny,"I mainly purchased this because I use EggBeaters and egg whites, not something you fry! Ugh, just trying to be healthy. Cooks very unevenly. Outside cooks first middle is soupy. I find if I stir it mid cook it works out better. I hate to say it's just okay, but with a little experimenting I think it will work. I used to use an on the stove omlette maker which was much easier."
5,Works For Me,"Crack one egg into a small 1-2 cup container, add 1 tablespoon of water, whip with a stick-type immersion blender, hand-stir in amendments, pour into one side of omelet maker, secure lid, and nuke for 99 seconds. Hasn't exploded so far, and makes very nice ""puffy"" omelets."
3,Doesn't quite turn out like the picture,"I have been eating omelets in the morning and figured this would be an easier way to make them instead of messing up the kitchen making them in the pan. I followed the directions as specified in the packaging; however, I wasn't too impressed. It doesn't seem to evenly cook the egg; the middle turns out fine, but the outer edges had a rubbery taste to them. I tried it with 2 eggs, ham bits, cooked sausage, bell peppers, and cheese. I will probably stick to cooking them in the pan or just scramble all of the ingredients together. It was worth a shot for the price."
4,AbdulQadir al-Jilani not included?,"I haven't ordered this book yet but look forward to reading it eventually -- it looks like a well-organized description of key figures in the Islamic tradition. However, after viewing the index and table of contents, I cannot find any inclusion of Sheikh AbdulQadir al-Jilani, considered by many to be ""Sultan al-Awliya"" and an irreplaceable figure in Islamic history. I cannot for the life of me understand why he is not included in this text."
5,Writing? Reading? Book Serves Both.,"This excellent novel is also a how-to book that manages to be funny and heart-wrenching, sarcastic and sweet and playful but not offensive all in one. A clever parody that never belabors readers like other, ordinary how-to write books, this is a gem that meets your entertainment and your craft needs."
5,Easy to Love,"This book makes you laugh out loud, and feel strongly for and with the characters. A great book to take with you to the park and enjoy on a blanket in the grass."
5,"A delightful, inspirational cure for writer's block","Plenty of spiritual guides have been written on the subject of the I Ching; but none with the specialized focus of Sarah Jane Sloane's The I Ching For Writers: Finding The Page Inside You, which tells how to apply I Ching concepts to writer's block and inspirational paths. Each of the I Ching's sixty-four hexagrams is interpreted by Sloane from years of study of over fifty translations, and synthesized into comments pertaining to writer's struggles with words. The I Ching For Writers: Finding The Page Inside You evolves into a delightful, inspirational cure for writer's block under Sloane's careful applications and analysis."
5,eco friendly,I would suggest this product to anyone that wants to reduce water usage at the hose with little out of pocket.
5,"Great songs, destined to be stars!","One of the few CD's that gives you a lot of good songs, not just 1 hit and a lot of fill ins. For the first album, you can tell they se\pent a lot of time on the studio to make it right. Lyric is a new group that will be big someday."
5,Unmatched Price/Quality,I've been using this product for over 5 years now. 0.5 mm lead is thin and keeps a nice point when writing and when I hold the pencil it feels like a precision instrument. This Pentel has a black barrel with brushed and satin aluminum finish and nice grooves on the barrel for a superb feel. The fact that folks are writing reviews for a $10 pencil should communicate more than the words here.
2,Missing book,"My order was very quick getting to me, but it was missing a key part of it. The ""kit"" I received was one book. It was missing the student book. I was very disappointed when I had to purchase a separate student book."
1,False Advertising,"This is NOT a kit.This was the ONE Teacher's Manual and nothing else. The kit is includes the Teachers Manual, the Student Workbook, and music cd. Unfortunately, Amazon was unable to do anything to make the situation right by just sending the Student Workbook and cd. So my only recourse was to return the product and buy from someone else. Waste of time, and money - cost way too much stress."
1,Yuck!,"My wife and I gave it about 30 minutes and decided to give up on this stinker. This movie had all the professional qualities of something a group of amateurs would produce with rented equipment in a garage. Acting, dialogue, video production all stunk. The story line had potential but the overall poor quality of every other aspect of this film made trying to watch it a total waste of time. Very bad."
1,Looking for a new microwave,I would not recommend this microwave to anyone. It lasted about five months and then gave up the ghost.
3,Ok microwave,Can't say anything special about this product. It does seem to run a little slow for a 1250 watt oven though.
4,Quick Shipment,The item was shipped quickly and arrived in good working condition. The only issue I have with the transaction is that it was to be sent anonymously but my name was put on the package to that person.
4,Panasonic NN-H765WF Microwave Oven from Amazon,"My husband and I are happy that we bought this product.Indeed, the noise is quiet. The price is also reasonable.However, even if we pay more, I wish it was not made by China under a Japanese name brand.Too many Chinese products deter me to buy anything in general. In the U.S., we need our own production, ""MADE IN THE USA""."
4,adequate,The oven is a great size and has nice features. I am disappointed in the operation of the opening button. It is sticking and I am afraid it is going to break at any time.
4,Panasonic NN-H765WF Microwave,"I haven't used this to it's full extent, but so far, I'm very happy with it. The only glitch is that the door sticks when I push the open button, so it takes two hands to open it - making that inconvenient. Overall, I'm pleased with it."
2,Died after 30 months,Great while it worked - 30 months is just too short of a time before a failure (DOA).
1,failed after 7 days,After 7 days of light use the turntable on Panasonic Inverter microwave oven failed to turn. Re-seated glass plate several times - no help. Nothing in manual about this problem. Did read the negative reviews before ordering but was hoping to get a good one. Fortunately amazon.com has an excellent returns policy. They are sending UPS to our house to pick it up.
5,Excellent Oven -- measure your space!,"This is a great microwave oven. Cooks fast, cooks through, I figured the review that says it is HUGE was exaggerating BUT it is bigger than the 10+ year old oven I replaced -- It takes the entire depth of the counter/cabinet that it sits on-- But so far it is 5-stars."
1,total failure,"I ordered this microwave in November and it failed to heat on January 2nd. I've ordered a replacement, so we'll see if the new one lasts a little longer."
5,Great microwave!,"I love this microwave! As other reviewers have stated, it's big. Check the specs though - that's what they're for. This microwave has the perfect amount of presets. I can't count how many times I have used the Sensor Reheat feature. I haven't cooked anything in this yet, it's not something I ever do really. But it has settings for cooking different things like oatmeal or potatoes. The digital display is big enough to read from across the kitchen. It's not loud to me, but I can only compare it to the last 8-year old microwave that finally gave in. I'm very pleased with the speed that it heats food up. Overall a great buy for a great price."
4,Meets expectations,"I chose this microwave because it was the size I wanted and available where I live when I wanted it at the price I expected for this type of microwave. Unlike my previous microwave, it does not have dedicated buttons for my most common uses, but the buttons I press most often are real buttons instead of membrane keys. It works as it should."
2,Not built to last,Worked great for 4 years then it caught on fire and blew up. It was scary. The microwave was well taken care of and I never put anything that wasn't supposed to go into a microwave in there so it should have lasted. I would have given it one star but when it was working it did work well.
1,Junk.....H97 error code after 120 uses,"I bought this microwave for a vacation home in April 2009. It was used maybe 120 uses since we were at the vacation house only 8 weeks a year. This week (July 2010) it just started flashing H97 error code, which means bad generator. Warranty covers the magnetron tube, but not the labor. Which means I paid $1.40 every time I pressed start. Panasonic makes such garbage, I should have known better."
5,one of the best microwave ovens out there,We bought this to replace an over the stove unit and decided to stay with using it. best counter top unit out there.
4,Good Enough,"High wattage, but NO auto cook button, very surprised with that. Good basic MW, it suits me fine. I'll adjust to the lack of conveinence of those auto 1-6 min buttons...smile. Arrived earlier than promised, no breakage."
4,Panasonic Microwave 1.6 Cu ft,"I received the microwave very quickly and all I had to do was open the box and plug it in. So far, it has worked great. The buttons are a little different than our last Panasonic but his is also a smaller version. I have thawed steaks, made au gratin potatoes, popcorn, steamed veggies, and everything turned out just fine:)"
5,It's a winner!,"We had a combination range hood/microwave for over two decades. Then I found I needed a countertop microwave as arthritis limited my reaching up and removing the dishes from the oven. Naturally, we checked Amazon to read the reviews on various models and we chose this Panasonic. It arrived promptly, in perfect condition, and we have truly enjoyed using it. The power level button is especially quick and easy to use. The biggest selling point was the inverter feature whereby the oven cooks constantly at the power level desired, not by cooking that alternates full power with no power at all. We definitely recommend this product and we couldn't be more pleased with our purchase."
2,"Good, But Bad","The microwave function is great. Unfortunately, after living with this for two months, I wish i hadn't bought it.The designers did a horrible job on the glass tray. It is exceptionally difficult to line-up the floating support ring and the tiny center notches (it's a two-step process). You might say: ""So what, how often do you have to do that"". Well, not only every time you clean it, but the engineering is so bad that the glass tray slips off with ease. After you go through this manhandling 8-10 times a week, you'll say : ""I wish I had bought a different microwave""!"
1,Never could open the door,"I really looked forward to getting this microwave, I have used Panaonic both at home, and in a research lab, all to good use and they are good products.This one however arrived, and I could not even once from the very start, get the door open. The latch was totally disconnected from anything. Ran a few seconds just to .. well at least SEE inside, and noticed the electrical right panel was loose, a hazard.Amazon very good about taking back, or easy so far this side of pickup tomorrow.This is a shame, as I do know that Panasonic can make a very good MW's. But, this design in particular is so precarious, that I did not opt for a replacement but a refund."
4,Panasonic NN-H765WF Full-Size 1.6 cu. ft. 1250 watt microwarve,"I purchased this one because it had to fit a specific spot above my oven. The size was the key for the purchase because it fits many of my big and wide dishes on the rotating tray that was included. I have a full size microwave bacon tray that measures something like a 8 1/2 by 11, and it fits the rotation tray just right. I get perfect bacon everytime. I mainly use it for warming up things and it works perfectly. I liked the color white too because it doesn't show the dust on it as bad as black and white gives the kitchen a cleaner and brigher look.If I have one complaint, I would have the wattage increased. If you need something very tall, this is not the microwave for you."
2,Serious WIFI interference,"Functionally, the product seems fine. The user-interface is easy to use and the reliability, so far, has been good. Cooking is a bit slower, but more even, than my previous GE microwave oven.But WIFI interference is a major issue with this oven. Our WIFI network is unusable on the lower floor of the house when the oven is on. In this day and age, with so many dependencies on WIFI, I don't understand why manufacturers can't shield their appliances appropriately. Our old GE microwave did not have a problem with WIFI, so I never envisioned this could be so problematic."
2,Died at just under 2 years.,"This just stopped working today after just under two years of moderate use. I've never had a microwave that died. They always just got passed along as we moved or our needs changed. It worked very well while we had it, but it certainly should last longer than two years. I would consider it another one, but most buggy things die within 30 days. This lasted long enough to prove it wasn't a bug, but likely just not built for the long haul."
4,Works Very Well,"This is our second Panasonic Microwave oven. I did look at other brands but in the end I went back to Panasonic after the first one died after five years. I figured that was a fair enough length of service for the price. And I have other Panasonic brands ( plasma TV, digital camera, etc) that have performed well. Had this for two months now and we still like the Sensor Cook and Re-heat feature. I can't give it a 5-Star yet based on the fact that the first one broke after 5 years. I'm sure, for the price, there is another brand out there that will perform far beyond 5 years."
5,Excellent Full Sized Microwave,"We are very pleased with this Microwave. The larger turntable is especially handy for heating more than one dinner or entree. The Sensor Reheat function is the best feature of the microwave, and works perfectly to heat food to the right temperature for us. We have had no problems either using or learning to use this nice microwave. It was shipped quickly and was well packed. 5 Stars all around on this purchase."
4,Great value for the price,"I purchased this Panasonic to replace a slightly larger Sharp that served me well for about a dozen years. The Panasonic is not quite as powerful, but hardly worth mentioning. I particularly like the sensor cook and the reheating function... both seem to excel at what they are supposed to do!"
2,Loved it Hated it,"I have had two of these. If you can afford one every couple years, then this one is great, if you would at least 3 to 5 years from a fairly high ticket item like this then keep looking. I did love the dern thing."
5,Love It!!,I didn't really know how bad my old microwave was getting till the first time I used this one! This lean mean microwaving machine is awesome!
1,"i am low tech,so i have been unable to make it cook so far.","how do you make this thing cook? so far i tell it to cook for so many minutes and it just functions as an expensive time,lol."
2,Glass tray broke and I cannot find replacement,I LOVED it but the glass tray broke about 6 weeks after i got it. It cracked while in use not by any abuse. I cannot find a replacement. Help me find one please and I'll bring my stars up!
2,You like BIG?,It was my fault: I didn't really focus in on the dimensions. On your kitchen counter it looks big enough to pull your '57 Chevy into in order to get that perfect baked on enamel paint job. (just kidding... I doubt if there's any Chevy part that a microvave oven would like.)Amaazon was nice enough to let me return this behemoth and get a much smaller unit.
1,lasted a year,"Bought this initially because of space limitations in our cabinets. Worked fine while it lasted, which was right at one year. Then it quit completely. Chinese made, thank you very much. Now, I am faced with purchasing another one due to the same cabinet spacing limitations, or hunting around to find another brand with the same dimensions"
4,Good Microwave- great price,"It's not as powerful as I had hoped, but it's basic and cheap and gets the job done. There's no ""one-button"" cook functionality so that's a bummer, but the defroster is great, just as all the reviews say."
3,plastic parts weak,Have had this for 2 years. The seal on the door leaks moisture to the inside of the glass front. The button to push to open the door sticks and doesn't alway open the door. It cooks great and like the other features. just need to make the moving parts more durable
4,Panasonic NN-H765WF Genius 1.6 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave,"It is fast, not too complicated regular microeave that works cosmetically in a white environment.It replaced a 56 lb convection microwave so at 32 lb seems light dutySomething a simple as the turntable has cut my attention to the products being heated in half.Would recommend same."
3,Sufficient,Microwave is okay. It is fairly big... It is most certainly powerful. It just seems a little cheap? Maybe it's just me but I am used to over the counter units and have had some nice ones.
2,Lasted 1 year and 5 months,"It was a really excellent product before dead, easy to use, generous space and fast cooking. Really hope it could last longer."
1,DANGEROUS!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS MICROWAVE!!!! After, owning it for 4o days, the Metal Interior Framing Panel started sparking and turning black. Manufacturer Warranty is a Joke! Called Panasonic and spoke with a Supervisor who told me that all he could do was give me a reference number and wait for Engineering to call me back. I am a persistent person and when I asked to be transferred to that Department directly he put me on hold...after an hour no one picked up! Glad to see this is how they handle a Consumer Safety Issue. Oh, did I mention my child was standing within a foot of it when it started sparking. Please, Please, Please Do not Purchase this. It NEEDS to be Recalled!"
3,"Great for the price, but a few significant flaws","We've had this for just over a year now and for the most part we've been really happy with it.It did take a little getting used to popping microwave popcorn in it, but nowhere near as bad as I'd feared after reading some of the reviews. I don't even use the popcorn button on it. I stick a 3.5oz bag in it, set it for 2:30 on high, and it comes out perfect.Cooks very even, sensor reheat is awesome, sleek and attractive appearance.BUT, there are a few fatal flaws:- The button to open the door doesn't work right half the time during the past few months and is getting worse. The noise doesn't bother me, but having to press it in really hard two times to get the door open is annoying.- It's a bit short inside - forget cooking overly tall items.- It's more of a pain to clean (inside) because of the sleek dimensionsGreat deal for the price, great features, but a few compromises."
4,Children love it!,This CD is packed with all the familiar songs that we have grown to love. What makes it different from the rest is that there are children themselves singing the songs. I teach dance classes for children and my little ones (3 and 4 yr. old) love this CD. I would recommend this one for the younger children that enjoy music and want to sing along.
4,Toddler Rock,My 2 year old daughter loves this CD. The songs are fun and easy to dance to. The nursery rhymes are familiar and my daughter enjoys reciting the lyrics and hearing them over and over and over again. This is definitely a great alternative to television and makes playtime much more fun! Your kids will love it.
5,We LOVE this CD!!,"We love this CD!! My daughter is 17 mos and she now dances to most of the songs and tries to sing along (it's more like mumble & hum :-) ). She loves Itsy Bitsy Spider and unfortunatly wants to listen to it over & over. It does get on my nerves after the 5th time or so, but SO WHAT! This CD has helped to distract my daughter out of a meltdown more than a few times which in my eyes makes it well worth it."
2,Annoying!! (For parents at least),"Wow, the reviewer who said parents would be annoyed were RIGHT on the button. This is only the third time I've *had* to listen to this CD and I'm already ready to chuck it into the trash. It's Ok when the kids are just singing as themselves, but in way too many of the songs the kids are faking English accents (why?)-- very annoying when it's not your own kid. :)"
3,It grew on me and now im loving it !!!!,"After all I tought ""why cant density meet happines?"" this guys are so Californian and they love sabbath, if we put togheter the happines in their voices but also distortion on guitars and bass and also in this release Mr. Bjork on drums a good thing can occur but I didnt saw that at first so now I apologize and I say "" I loooooove this guys""PS Now im actually thinking about getting ""Godzillas eating dust"" we all change right ?HM"
4,"good beginning, dense ending","Starts really good, but by the middle begins to turn too slow, neverending jams are cool for a while, but not all the way...California Crossing is still my favorite."
3,Can't get past the sound,"Like the previous reviewer, I'm a great admirer of the Great Conductors of the 20th Century series. The few I've bought (Stokowski, Markevitch, Mitropoulos) have been exceptional: startlingly good sound and stellar performances.Unfortunately, I found this installment to be an exception. I'm fairly tolerant of variable sound, since many of my CDs are of older performances recorded live. The sound here, especially when you consider it's mainly from the 1950s, is barely up to 1927 quality; it's severely constricted and easily overloaded. For me, it took away whatever pleasure I might have derived from the performance itself.Still, if you remain undeterred by that caveat, then do plunk down your change -- these two-CD sets are very inexpensive."
5,Beyond Wealth,"A ""good quick read"", that looks not only at the financial aspects of retirement, but the personal issues as well. Goes beyond the usual mentality of a total focus on wealth accumulation and asks important questions of the reader in terms of what do you want to do with your money when you finally do retire? Most retirees ultimately find that one can only fish or play so much golf, and for a time may find themselves questioning whether retirement is everything they thought it would be. This book teaches the reader to look, not just at finances, but at the total picture, and to develop a ""Life Goals"" system in order to help achieve a smooth financial and personal transition to a fulfilling retirement experience."
5,The follow up to Rebel Without A Crew,"If you've read ""Rebel Without a crew""then you'll love this book. If you havent then you'll find this an amazing tale of an inspirational director and how he makes movies amid the hype and frustrations of Hollywood.Our hero, used to making films single handedly, now has to put up with a Hollywood crew. Its amazing reading and inspiration to all would be film makers.For those who have read Rebel Without A Crew, you'll love this book!"
5,Swans' glorious last breath,"Though nothing can fully recreate the surreal power of a live swans concert, and those who were fortunate enough to witness such majick would likely be disapointed by any attempt to do so, ""Swans Are Dead"" is a beautiful album, and well worth any price. The first (white) disc, an archive of the 95-96 tour, features live versions of their newer work, mostly from the last studio album ""Soundtracks for the Blind"". Though an excellent disc, I could not feel its full effect due to anticipation for the second (black) disc and the much talked about final song ""Feel Happiness"", Michael Gira's emotional tribute to his ""child"" whom he devoted fifteen years of his life to. The album's only weak moment, in my opinion, is a stuffy rendition ""Blood on Your Hands"" in which the listener may believe Jarboe has as cold. Nevertheless, I cannot stress enough how essential the music of swans is. Buy this album and any other you may come across."
2,One More Nail in the Coffin,"I'm trying to forgive Michael Gira and Jarboe for dragging the death of their ""main"" band out like the demise of the monster in a cheesy horror film, and it's getting pretty difficult. It isn't that I don't appreciate the incredibly diverse body of work that they left behind, and the live shows that I have attended were near-religious experiences, it's just that those experience haven't tended to translate all that well in recordings. Jaboe isn't all that scary when she isn't hanging out over the front of the stage screaming like a more muscular Diamanda Galas, and Gira's leadership of the the whole churning mess comes out sounding more like a Walkman recording of a Pigface show. This pair has always been a trifle arrogant in the sheer volume that they have thrown at their fans, and this is a prime example."
3,So and so....,"NEVERMORE knows how to deliver, but this album is just remote control for them. Anyway, it's a band that has its own sound."
3,Good...but not excellent,"This is Nevermore's 2nd best album behind ""Politics of Ecstacy"" It is better than ""Dreaming Neon Black"" because it has a harder edge, and more than one or two good songs. Still, they seem to be losing their creative edge because they basically sound like all other heavy thrash bands on this recording. Gone is their unique sound exibited on ""Politics of Ecstacy"" and especially ""Dreaming..."" Also, Tim Calvert is no longer with them on this recording, and I really miss the two guitar lineup which was so awesome on their earlier efforts. Warrel Dane continues to put his guts into every song, and he is without a doubt the greatest vocalist in metal today....I hope that their next release will provide a little more originality, and a little bit less of the generic thrash that is played on this recording...Still, they are miles above any other band out there..."
4,????,"alright.I was expecting a little bit better, i guess i am gonna stop buying CD's and start buying just songs:)"
1,Do not be fooled by all these 5 star reviews!,"Warning! Warning! Warning! Do not be fooled. Comparisons to Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Metallica's ...and Justice for All ect. is totally disingenuous! If you are an 80's metal fan you will not like this! This IS nu-metal crap...they sound like a cross between a crappy version of Queensryche, a crappy version of Iced Earth and the real version of Korn! The lyrics are horrible, the songs uninspired. I was fooled by the previous reviewers and made the mistake of throwing money away on this garbage, don't make the same mistake if you are a true 80's metaler..STAY METAL!"
5,Heavy,"this is one down-tuned riff fest mania, the different producer they used one here (A.Sneap - StuckMojo, etc..) has certainly given them the heaviest production that i have heard in a very long time, and i listen to Suffocation and others like that, this is right up there in terms of guitar sound. Other than that there are some beautiful melodic moments on here, Dane's voice is the hilite as always, always a pleasure to hear its variety. Van bashes on the drums like never before, the bass is thunderous, but most importantly the guitars are so heavy that Korn's sound seems like AM Radio material."
4,Thrash/Power at it's best!,"Thrashy guitars backed up by great clean vocals. Not high and whiny, it's possible to make that style of vocals without using that breathy, feminine voice your average power metal band might use, Warrel Dane does some WICKED stuff on this album, high yet wth a lot of lung power behind them. And don't forget the awesome thrash guitar playing mixed that drives the absolutely insane, thundering ""Inside Four Walls"" track. ""Narcosynthesis"", ""Engines of Hate"" and especially the second riff from the title track drive the listener to the brink of insanity. Some of these riffs are unreal. I might say I expected great things from Nevermore if they hadn't already produced exactly what I wante to hear."
4,Best effort yet!,"Nevermore can be a little on the mellow side some times. But this album - the majority of the songs are a marriage of some tantalizing power riffs and, as always, great vocals. Definitely their best release so far."
1,one of the worst games ever,"Very awkward player movement mechanics. Environments could have been worse, but still a pretty boring. Nothing about this game displays any imagination by the game developers. I got it for 4.99 and I still feel it wasn't worth the money.It's seriously one of the lamest games I've ever played. If you want a good shooter game, try anything else. If you use the first Star Wars Battlefront as a guide for the player movement, I would say it's not even half as good. If SWBF2 was a 10 and SWBF1 was a 5, this paintball game is a 2."
1,Do not waste your money!,"I purchased this book with the intention of using it as a study aid for the NCC boards for my NNP examination. The positives consist of obtaining practice with test questions. There are many questions, however not at the level I would expect on the NCC exam. Although the answers are provided, there are no rationales. I think this would be more beneficial with rationales, and would be a great practice study companion. However,this is not the case.I would not recommend this study book."
1,Outdated and too advanced,"This book provides many tests and questions but found the information to be outdated, especially with NRP practices, and above the level many could understand."
2,I very reluctantly recommend this terrible CD....,"This isn't jazz, and it isn't swing. It's not original, and it's very weak imitation. The female singer does a very poor Billie imitation that no one familiar with her work could tolerate. This CD imitates great musicians like Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong; SNZ are mediocre musicians at best. Compare it to the real thing - the original is more fun to dance to and sing along with, and the talent is amazing.... That said, it's not too painful to put in the CD player when you're not paying close attention. And SNZ deserve credit for repopularizing music outside the mainstream and may perform an invaluable service by introducing a new generation to this type of music, even if in a diluted form - if you know and love jazz and swing, you'll be sorely disappointed; if you haven't been exposed, this can serve as an introduction."
1,"Worth hearing once, but not worth buying...","I rented this CD from the library and thought it was not bad. However, if I had to compare it to Royal Crown Revue or Big Bad Voodoo Daddies, I would have to say it's a laugh..."
1,"Oh please,","Listen, this isn't real swing. Maybe you people had better listen to the real thing before you say how great this is. Listen to the classics, the people who made swing/big band what it is! Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, Gene Krupa, Artie Shaw, and all the others. They would turn in their graves if they saw this poor excuse for swing. You people judge this as swing when you haven't heard anything to judge it against. Listen to the real, bring back the classic sound of swing and not this...whatever it is!"
4,They're not like CPD so get over it already!,"Oh, for crying out loud: They're not supposed to be like Cherry Poppin' Daddies. Apples and oranges, people. Related, but not the same genres. Compare them to Hot Club of Cowtown, maybe, but not CPD.I like the original 1920's-1940's stuff better, but that's a matter of personal taste and not a judgment call. SNZ aren't supposed to be carbon-copies of that era so it doesn't really matter that they aren't purely swing or purely jazz or purely any given decade. They're fun. They do what they do, well. Lighten up and dance!"
4,Got My Own Thing Now,"What makes this fine LP for me is Katherine Whalen's voice. The way she hops into a falsetto at the bridge on ""Put A Lid On It"" gets me going every time, and the same voice has the same effect on me when I hear ""Prince Nez."" She just kills on ""Blue Angel."" She's priceless.And this band swings, in that swingin' pre-Swing way. ""Hell,"" which became a surpise MTV fave, is the most modern-sounding thing here, so don't be expecting an insight into youth culture.A lot of this sounds like 4 a.m. in the French quarter. The kind of music you'd want to listen to on a night on the town with Tom Waits."
5,Historic CD introduced a whole new generation to jazz,"What can I say about the Zippers that hasn't been said? When I first heard ""Hot"" I got the CD and spoke to my father in law about the old big band songs. I know several other people have done the same.The Zippers is music you can listen to with your kids, your father in law, anyone who likes good rhythm and talented music.Is ""Hot"" worth buying enhanced? I think so. I can put it in the changer next to the old version and there are some subtle differences."
5,Swingin'!,"With all the swing bands out now like Brian Setzer Orchestra, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Cherry Poppin' Daddies, etc., I still think the Squirrel Nut Zippers are the best modern swing band. With the little public recognition they get, their music is the closest to the good ol' swing. Both ""HOT"" and ""PERENNIAL FAVORITES"" by SNZ are wonderful, and a great listen for anyone who likes swing."
5,Good God A-Mighty!,"Transport yourself and your happy feet to some bygone era that never existed. Snappy speakeasy-jazz tunes lit up with fiery vocals. The Squirrel Nut Zippers deliver some kinda funky calypso slidey-trombone thang wearing ostrich feathers and spats. Whatcha gonna do? You'll dance, oh yes, you will! This one wins my coveted ""Best Album To Clean House By"" for 1997."
3,A Bit of Something Different,Listen to this for a bit of something different. Everyone needs this sort in their listening collection. Listen and enjoy.
5,HOT CD - I still did not receive it,"Dear Sir / Madam,I have not received this CD yet. I was on business trip and i think i was a little bit late to pick up the package at the post office. I was told that the package was sent back to the sender.Plase help, I would like to have this CD,Elfide Sentuerk Keller"
2,"Spirited, but...","Yes, it's fun but....if you care about perfect pitch it's painful. It's not like the clips I heard before purchasing."
5,Do you Know What It Means To Miss New Orleans?,"Once upon a time I was so in Royal Crown Revue and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy that I could not listen to Squirrel Nut Zippers. This is their second album. And it sounds great. Blue Angel is a beautiful ballad, Got My Own Thing Now one of the best fast songs, Katharine Whalen is a great singer, sometimes she sounds like Billie Holiday. This is absolutely not Gangster Bop or Jump Blues it's more swinging jazz or dixieland! Dirttty!Now they are one of my favourite bands."
4,"great tunes, strange singing","The singing on this album is a bit...special.Katherine Whalen attempts to do a Billie Holliday impression. Sometimes it works, in a way, if you listen to it with an open mind. Nobody in the band can actually ""sing"" in any conventional sense. On one hand that detracts from the music, but on the other hand, it adds to their quirkiness.However, there's more to this album than quirkiness, namely some insanely catchy hot jazz/dixieland tunes.Only the songs ""Twighlight"" and ""Flight of the Passing Fancy"" are nothing special.You've certainly heard their radio hit ""Hell"" (In the afterlife). Almost every song on this album is actually MORE catchy than that."
4,1930's and 1940's Jazz Style Revival,"This album I had to get my hands on after I heard the single ""Hell"". I just loved the raw unbridaled energy and enthusiasm of this song. The background vocals on the chorus brought me back to Cab Calloway and the old big bands when the band members would sing responses to the lead vocalist. The musicianship is not polished and sterile but rather raw and energetic. I reserve 5 stars for Cab Calloway and the original masters of the style, but this is an excellent and very listenable album and a nice mix of upbeat music and wilting ballads. The vocals on the album are shared between a female and male singer. This album reminds me also of Django Reinhardt and Leon Redbone. I recommend ""Hot"" to anyone with an appreciation of old jazz and just plan good music."
5,Dixieland jazz and speak-easy swing,"Being a fan of Royal Crown Review and the Cherry Poppin Daddies I was drawn in by the psuedo-swing sounds of the single ""Hell"". This album is not a swing album though. The best way to describe this album is more like 20s and 30s style dixieland jazz and pre-swing. This is the kind of music you would expect to hear in a speak-easy during prohabition. Their music has a very unique and fresh sound and is just a lot of fun to listen to. The music ranges from upbeat jazzy numbers such as ""Got my own thing now"" and ""Hell"" to sultry slow jazz numbers such as ""It aint you"" and ""Blue angle"". All the other songs fall somewhere in between. This is one very unique collections of songs that won't grow old anytime soon."
4,Retro-dixieland jazz and torch.,"First, let me get this off my chest. Squirrel Nut Zippers does not sound like Cherry Poppin' Daddies. The only similarity is that they both play retro music. This isn't either good nor bad, just different. Cherry Poppin' Daddies play retro-30's Big Band while Squirrel Nut Zippers play retro-20's Dixieland/Flapper music. Both are good.Squirrel Nut Zippers certainly seem to have a lot of fun on this CD and I had a lot of fun listening. I especially like the baritone sax, the banjo, and the baritone ukelele (not instruments you hear a lot in today's popular music.) The female lead singer, Katharine Whalen, has a voice that sounds right out of a Betty Boop cartoon - unique and oh so cool. I'd love to hear her sing some more torch songs. I'm anxious for the next album."
1,I enjoy S.N.Z. but...,"I thoroughly enjoy Squirrel Nut Zippers, but the download I received from Amazon was buggy. The download contained starts and stops and restarts within each track. Tried downloading from the cloud too and it was the same. I contacted Amazon and they never made any real attempt to make it right. I have purchased a lot of media through Amazon in the past, but this was my last."
5,Squirrel Nut Zippers rock,"Their ""jazz"" rocks!They're not exactly 20-40's revival, but they sound a little bit like that. They're clearly not rock, but they rock! They're more jazz than rock, but have a really unique sound. ""Hot"" was the first CD of their's that I bought, and I absolutely love it. The title is correct.It's hard to categorize them, except to say that they make great jazzy music. Not stogy, not retro, not antique, but totally modern with a style that is influenced by the jazz of the 20's. An opposite of elevator music."
4,Wails!,"Appropriately titled, 'Hot' wails from beginning to end. In fact, prior to seeing SNZ live I would certainly have rated this one 5 stars. However, the recording is so tame compared to their live performances I had to back down to 4.By all means, see them live if you can."
1,Look elsewhere,I agree with the earlier comment regarding this text which points out its confusing explanations and lack of examples. Even in the case of someone looking to review calculus this text is not at all useful and a very expensive waste of money.
1,Horrid,"The book is a disaster. I had to suffer with it for 2 semesters. None of the other students in my Calc I and Calc II courses got anything from it either, as far as I can tell. I had to scramble and seek information from other calc books in order to understand what differentiation and integration was all about. The text in no way prepares one for the exercises. There's no connection between the text and the exercises. In the exercises there appear some inane, open-ended questions that seem to be trying to make some unfathomable point. This is not a book anyone can learn from. I would strongly advise any student who must use this book as their course textbook to CHANGE COLLEGES. There are many great calculus books out there, on all levels. For those who prefer a 'calculus reform' approach, I would recommend Calculus Lite, by Frank Morgan. For the more traditional approach, I got a lot out of Anton's classic."
2,Not a good foundation for beginning calculus students.,"This book does not provide a good foundation for beginning calculus students. It lacks emphasis on explanation & provides one with unclear examples, leaving the student out in the dark. The book itself even states 'we focused on a smaller number of key concepts, emphasizing depth of understanding, rather than breadth of coverage.' (preface, p.iii)"
4,Suitable for Social Science Students Rather Than Math Majors,"This is, in some sense, an excellent textbook on calculus. I highly recommend this book to the non-math majors. For the math majors, I will suggest not to use it. The books I recommend for students majoring in mathematics are Marsden's three-volume calculus, Spivak's Calculus, and Apostol's two-volume classics. The last one is for the advanced level."
1,"extremely frustrating, with glimpses of brilliance","I think, from reading the other customer reviews of this book, that this must be one that you either love, or hate. Put me in the latter category. There was great potential in this book - Alison Rose is clearly a good writer, she has brushed up against many other good writers and interesting people, and led an unconventional life. But. Arrgggh! She tells us only the faintest of details, skips around in time so it is difficult to piece together what happened when, and gives us no context for her actions or her memories. She has had a devastating effect on others - men and women - in her life (judging from what she tells us, anyway). But there's no real indication of WHY she was able to captivate so many interesting, intelligent and prominent people."
2,"Come on, Alison, snap out of it !","I choose this book because I saw that Alison Rose has been a contributor to the ""New Yorker"" magazine, and thought this might be a stimulating, inspirational book for other aspiring writers. Instead, it is the sad story of someone with apparently many capabilities and talents who has spent her life hanging on to others (mostly men) for her identity. There are no photographs of Rose (except for, presumably, the one on the dust cover) or anyone else who has been in her life, which is frustrating. Instead, she spends quite a bit of time telling us how incredibly attractive (and talented) she is by quoting what others have said about her. It is also rather appalling that a woman who is now 60 years old continues to refer to herself as a ""girl""."
5,"Very nice picture, great player","After two years of using an Apex DVD, watching a movie on this baby is great. The picture is 10 times better, and the audio is sweet.Another big plus (for me) is that it is very thin and doesn't take up too much space."
1,Read the Fine Print,I admit that I did not read the fine print on this item. I thought that I would be receiving the 4 pair of glasses in the colors in the picture and that is why I purchased it as I wanted the pink ones and blue ones. I received my purchase today and it is a yellow pair....VERY DISSAPOINTING!!! Now I have only a couple of weeks to find the glasses I thought I was getting to wear to a Hippie Party. I am always happy with my purchases on Amazon...this is my first flub....DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT.
5,Better than the Shunning,I recently finished her series on the Shunning and I found this one to be even better. Her ability to write seemingly in 1st person while technically still being in 3rd person is amazing. Her skill enables you to get into the mind of the character while still 'hearing' the narrator. The only thing that drives me nuts is that she tends to write slow for the first 3/4 of the book and then crams in all this action towards the end of the book. I love her story lines which are filled with mystery and secrets.I lived in an Amish community and can say from experience that what she writes about the Amish is very accurate. I look forward to reading her other books!
5,couldn't get enough of these characters,"I hate fiction but picked this book (the covenant) up because I am interested in the Amish and enjoy visiting Lancaster, PA which is only 1 hour away from where I live. Well, I was totally hooked...bought all 5 in the series...passed them on to all my family and friends that like to read...each and everyone of us LOVED these books and are finding it hard to find anything that compares in holding our interest as much.Do yourself a favor and buy all 5!! Beware: you will stay up late reading these!!"
5,It's Back in Print,"""Tales of Mithgar"" is back in print, and is rereleased as a companion piece to ""Red Slippers: More Tales of Mithgar."" I wrote the original ""Tales"" way back when ... and the main reason for doing so was so that I could explore more of the nature of Warrows in their natural surroundings of the Boskydells. I will naturally give this collection of stories a five star rating. :) I do hope you enjoy them. But the main reason for posting this review is to let you know that ""Tales of Mithgar"" is back in print. Best regards, Dennis L. McKiernan HTTP://www.mithgar.com"
4,Some Good Stories,"I liked this book the best stories were the one that is about Baron Stoke and the one where the older man and the young boy had to gurad that outpost that story was very touching and it really opens your eyes to the horrors of war. There is also a suprisingly good story about life and fishing and a king sized trout,I am an avid fisherman so I quite enjoyed that story. If you are a McKiernan fan I reccommend this book."
4,Great,"For anyone that has not read many of McKiernan's books based on Mithgar, this is the book to buy. You will get the flavor of what it is like to be in Mithgar and if you love it you'll know you should read more of his novels. If you're already accustomed to the world of Mithgar, there are at least 2 wonderful stories in here that you should read."
5,Good collection,"What were you expecting. It says right up front that it is collection of tales. There was no real 'plot'. It is a group of story tellers telling stories. Some tell good stories, some aren't quiet as adept. I would recommend it to any one. I've read every book D.M. has written and will continue to do so."
4,A fun read,I needed something to read in short spurts and this was perfect! It filled the time nicely and I was able to engage with one short story at a time & get to a believable end that made the read satisfying without seeming to end in the middle. I like the filling of detail in some of the area of the overarching Mithgarian tale.
5,One of the best guides to phpMyAdmin,"Although this book doesn't contain even one snippet of PHP code, it's still really useful to any PHP programmer, especially if you're just starting out. It's likely that you'll use phpMyAdmin during development, and it's important to know about all the (hidden) features, so you can save time and work as efficient as possible.Initially, I had some worries that this book might be mainly targeted towards beginners, but this is not the case at all, and it's more of a complete guide to phpMyAdmin than just a beginner's book. This book is targeted towards everyone, and even the most advanced programmers will learn a thing or two from this book, especially about PMA's own unique features.If you're looking for a good phpMyAdmin book, or still don't feel really comfortable with phpMyAdmin, I can definitely recommend this book. This is one of the best guides to phpMyAdmin, and the author has done a terrific job!"
4,"Great, helpful book!","I had quite a few questions that no amount of Googling would answer....this book answered them all!Clear pictures, troubleshooting. A must to include with any MySQL development..go Linux!"
3,It got the job done.,"It wasn't the easiest read, but it will give you all the information you need to handle phpmyadmin. I am not a programing guru, so I needed something I could handle and understand. This did the job. I bought the book used and though it was a previous edition, it provided me with everything I needed."
1,Horrible experience,"Wednesday, November 21, 2012 - 11:30 AMI ordered a class C cover for a Winnebago Mini F24, which is 24 feet long. Every thing went well until half an hour ago when I opened up the shipped box and tied to cover the RV.Low and behold they sent me something for a class A. It's Hughes at least 12' too long, and naturally way too big for my small rig. Also the cover unpacking and installation instructions do not match the way this cover is boxed and shipped (do not listen to them it does not come ready to ""roll out"".) It was inside out. Thus I had to roll it back up, carry it down the ladder, and then unwrap it on ground level. Turn is right side out then fold/roll up as if to store then carry it back up the RV ladder. When on top of the RV I rolled it out I was astonished at the volume of material. When I finally realized that it is just way too big to be for my rig.Signed,Not a happy customer and more than a little upset."
1,Absolutely regret ordering,"Product might have been OK when it was new. I got a package that had been opened and re-taped, was missing the rope ties and instructions that were supposed to be in the box, and it looked like the box had been cut to remove the UPC symbols. I might expect that from a third party vendor but this shipped from Amazon. Totally unsatisfactory. I was already out at my RV and rain was on the way so I kept it - otherwise I would have returned it."
4,Good value for price,"We use three of these headsets in an office environment with Panasonic cordless phones. The incoming volume is adequate but the outgoing volume is marginal, even with the microphone selector switch at maximum. Occasionally, we are asked to ""speak up"" so they can hear us better. No incoming volume adjustment on the headset. The headset is comfortable and overall, I am satisfied with the value for an economy-priced headset. If we need more volume we'll have to spend more money."
4,Unique and crazy at the same time...,"I am getting sick of the average, typical music that is so popular today... This album is very differant than the commercial music out there... and it's only five dollars...that is why I bought it and the fact that I like Hive... but after listening to the whole album I take it everywhere"
4,Best in Class,"I have an almost exactly opposite experience with Freud as that mentioned in the above review. I am on my second FT2000 and have always received great customer service the few times I needed service. I just sent it to Freud USA and they fixed it within a week, only charging me once for a repair. It's a great router: quiet and powerful with easy to reach controls. As a professional woodworker, I recommend it without reservation."
3,Great if not for the collet,"I have loved using my Freud router for many years now, but on occasion when I have to use a 1/4"" bit, I have been frustrated by the reducing insert. If Freud had gone with a separate 1/4"" collet or at least put a rim around the 1/4"" insert to prevent it from falling too deep into the 1/2"" collet, I would probably be giving this 4 or 5 stars. But because the router is nothing without a good collet, 3 is the best I can do, even though this thing has tons of power and is smooth starting and running. It PLOWS through hard wood with gusto...when the collet reducer isn't stuck in it.If you were to only use 1/2"" bits, or you bought the separate 1/4"" collet, I would fully recommend this router."
1,made in Spain......customer service?????,"I bought this router new from a local retailer for about 2x what amazon is now selling it for. When I first used it the router was great, couldnt be happier. About 6 months of owning it I opened up the case and plugged it in....nothing....checked all the power, the switch etc.. and nothing... I called the service center to find out how to either fix it or have them repair it for me. The repair was to send it about 800 miles away at my cost, wait for 6-8 weeks as they repair it then pay for them to send it back to me.So here I am with a large paper weight...But hey...it looks cool on my workbench!? ok...not really1 star for being a great router to start with, only one star due to poor customer no-service"
2,not so good,first of all this book isnt in a brand new condition as .i have seen used books cheaper and in better condition then this.
5,Great Power pop and very hard to find!,This release was from 1982 and is reminiscent of the time. Simple straight forward production with great songwriting. Pick it up if you can. It will take you back to the early 80's before MTV and the (image is it...mantra).Recommended!
4,Great First Year Calendar,I really like this canendar because it has a space for a picture every month as well as a space for your baby's foot prints! How cute! I find it convienient because I can jot down baby's firsts on the calendar rather than finding the baby book and trying to remember what happened what day. I also like that you can customize it to start on any month. I do wish it was spiral bound instead of staples.
1,Dissappoint,I'm really disappointed. This perfume is not original. Do not return the product because I'm in another country.Llevo años usando este perfume y lo que recibi no es jamas la fragancia original. Si pudiera devolverlo lo haria.
5,I love this fragance.,"I like so much this fragance, smell so good and make me feel clean, sexy and pretty. The package was fine, and the product was new, so i was not worry about the quality of the item i received. This is the first time i buy fragances online, so i like the experience. I received the fragance 7 days after i ordered, but that was because i decided to try the basic s&h.; The size is not big but not too small, is perfect for me.I recomend this fragance."
4,fragancia,amazon me entrego el producto muy rapido pero como es un envio internacional aun no me ha llegado.
5,You must get this book,This is the best radiology review book I have seen. Easy to read and comprehensive with helpful diagrams and charts. No radiology resident should be without this book.
1,New edition coming out,"This is a good book for reviews, esp. if you hate those dense radiology textbooks. Everything is in outline format, with cartoonish illustrations. The 3rd edition is coming out at end of November 2002."
3,Distrubing,"This music is distrubing...I was terribly bothered by it and really couldn't bear to listen to it. Does that say enough? I don't have a problem with music of discord or contention such as Radiohead of Nine Inch Nails, but this is truly depressing black hole music the likes of which I hope never to hear again. I can understand how someone could appreciate what Swans do with their music, but listening to it's simply not good for my health (mental or physical). As a person from a reformed background (calvinist), I was taught to find redeeming value in almost anything. I failed to do so with Swans.Cheers :)"
2,can cause reaction,"My outpatient clinic used these wipes on my skin around my PICC line entrance wound and my skin broke out in blisters almost immediately, causing my wound to bleed. Two days later they tried to use them again with same results. Searching the Convatec websites was absolutely no use as they do not list the active ingredients anywhere - other sites gave the base of alcohol but nothing else. Very irresponsible for a medical supplies manufacturer not to give all ingredients especially when suggested uses for open wounds!! I would want to know list of ingredients prior to use~!!"
4,For Illiostomy users,"This is a very good product as a protective barrier and helps adheres the Ostomy bag to the skin and you are able to keep on for up to seven days. Convatec makes, I think, the best the best products and I have used many different ones. Allkare protective wipes are easy to use and are priced reasonable."
5,super sticky and saves the skin with a good Barrier,"AlKare, is used to make a layer between your skin and sticky dressing going on it. Like medical tape, bandaids, Tagaderms, VAC drape. AlKare becomes sticky like contact glue that holds your dressing down even better than the sticky on the dressing. This is so when you pull it off, you pull against the AlKare sticky, not your skin. Helps protect the skin."
4,Kats block heater,years ago i sold Kats brand block heaters for HD trucks. i am hooking this one up to a pex water line that is inside my 20'x24' insulated basement floor. it does a great job heating and the pump inside of the heater works well. Tony-western Nebraska
1,"total chinese junk. subpar, poor quality and they don't care.","JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK. these things barely last 4 months of being used mildly, we have a timer to turn on the power at 4:30am and my wife leaves at 5:30. that's ONE HOUR A DAY and they burn out within 6 months. buy a real heater from a non outsourced manufacturer like HOTSTART. and buy a unit like the one i have that is the TPS051GT8. it works awesome and unlike the throw away unit on this page you can buy a new thermostat when and IF it burns out. they ARE more expensive, buy try to warranty a junk KATS unit, you'll spend the same amount on a cheapy after buying 3 of them.( the kats units use WAY more power too) (GOOD LUCK CHUM !!) i have 2 kats units in my garage WITH reciepts. and they both blew at 4 and 7 months. CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP. buy a hotstart."
1,JUNK. buy a different brand,"I bought this for my duramax powered pickup, rather than replace the block heater. I found a spot to install it exactly according to the directions. I plugged it in once to verify that it worked and heated up the coolant. Did not use it again until a year later and it doesn't work at all....On farm tractors these things still work after 20+ years of abuse, exposed and this one doesn't work when it was only used once. If I could rate it less than 1 star I would...get what you pay for, or in this case you get less than what you pay for...."
1,"Kat's 13080 tank heater has failed, how do I get warranty?","Bought from Amazon.com, LLC 9/30/10 received 10/9/10 installed on port engine in my 36' Cruiser twin Volvo TAMD41A Diesels 11/2/10. Only run heaters for 30 minutes prior to start up a couple of times a month during winter for engine run up. More often during boating season April to October. This one was a replacement for a 12 year old heater that had no name on it so I don't know who made it. The new one failed during summer about August/2011, the power source is working correctly. How do i get a warranty replacement? The other 12 year old heater has failed as well. I need to replace it but will not buy Kat's unless they warrant the one I bought last year.Vancouver BCRobin"
1,Misleading Product Features,"It says ""No need to have the axle removed"" on the Product Features of these Boot but there was simple no way I could stretch these boots using a cone.I ended up causing these boots to tear apart as I had used too much force on it!It definitely requires the axle removed for proper installation.What a disappointment & waste of my time !"
4,FDR SPEECHES,Great book for any admirer or anyone wanting to read or study great work from a great President
5,"Gorgeously photographed, one-of-a-kind book!","This is the first book that captures the unique culture of Thrace through extensive photographs of ancient treasures from museums throughout Bulgaria. I am happy to see that all photographs are accompanied with captions providing a wealth of information about the objects as well as info in which museums they can be seen. The preface details the history, culture, and religion of Thrace, and it's filled with fascinating facts. It gives you deeper understanding of the political and cultural complexity of the ancient world and the relationships among Thracians, Greeks, Phoenicians, Romans, etc. There is a timetable at the end that conviniently displays the various periods in the development of Thrace parallel to famous world events.Needless to say, the book is a must for everybody interested in ancient history. It also makes a great coffee table book, unique and fascinating like Thrace itself."
4,F-16 Documentry and Thunderbirds,It a good video. But not the most enteraining. The show is interesting and even good quality of stock footage. Makes ideal for people interested in Military Aviation or Aircraft.
3,Silly but fun,Gotta love the crazy Angry Beavers. Bought as a stocking stuffer for my husband. Good for an hour of mindless laughs.
2,Experienced Short Life,"I purchased the Toshiba DVD SD-3900 player and within 20 hours of play, the sound started fading then the picture went blank. I reset the unit by unplugging it and plugging it back again. Unfortunately, the unit was unable to play another DVD movie stating disc error. I tried the same DVD movie in other DVD players I have and the movie played just fine. My new Toshiba SD-3900 DVD player ""Ran-Out-Of-Gas-Fast"". I returned the player for a full refund...I'm sure the company makes quality players however, I doubt it if I will purchase another Toshiba DVD player."
2,Broke,"- CD tray motor broke, you have to push the CD tray back in.- DVD player will not recognize DVDs anymore. It just keeps loading and spinning forever. Tried this with many DVDs (burned, foreign, and rented at blockbuster. no scratches)"
4,the humanisation of sex,"i loved this book, i actually read it in a day. i then gave it to my prudish boyfriend to read. it is quite a refreshing read. a lot of the writing might be about sex but i feel that adam is trying to take a humorous slant on the subject. one of the characters has never had an orgasm (which doesn't really bother her - oh yes its the female, suprise suprise!) the other is deeply insecure (the man - no wonder!) and yet they fall head over heels in love."
1,A Dreadful Book,"This is a dreadful book and I begrudged the time that I spent reading it. The author has adopted a precious prose style. He has also attempted to duplicate casual speech in the most annoying way. For instance, ""Le mgo"" for ""Let me go."" The more conventional approach would be ""Lemme go."" And consider this: the male lead referring to his being Jewish pronounces it ""Joosh."" I wouldn't object to attempting to mimic casual speech but it should be phonetically accurate."
1,Pass on this one...,"I got 10 pages into the book and felt guilty for not wanting to finish it, so I read another 10, and yet again another 10. I was really excited to read this book based on other reviews I read.I frequent British authors so I'm no stranger to the writing, humor, etc., but I could not get into the book or the characters and found Thirlwell's writing to be choppy at best.Definitely glad I got it used from Amazon. It's into the ""to be donated to the library"" pile with no guilt!"
5,Hysterical!,"Politics is an unbelievably funny book about how one gets into, and out of, a menage-a-trois and the inevitable problems that occur along the way. The narration gives the book a witty tone that'll keep you laughing all the way through."
1,"Adam Thirlwell, read ""Collected Stories"" by Saul Bellow!!!!","The only redeeming page of this juvenile, shallow, self important nonsense of a book is the mentioning of ""Collected Stories"" by Saul Bellow. This reader sincerely hopes that the author reads this and other Bellow books and realize that Adam Thirlwell talents are in other areas...and NOT IN LITERATURE.Stories of Guillaume Apollinaire, Osip Mandelshtam, Milan Kundera does not add any literary value to Adam Thirlwell book.What propelled Adam Thirlwell to expose his talentless ambition to the reading world? As an Oxford student he should know better."
5,Another stellar performance by one of Pennsylvania's best!,"Few recordings have the ability to keep even the most avid fan entranced from start to finish- Up There, Down Here is one such recording. The Badlees once again show their true love of music and lyrics in a collection of songs that span the range of good ol' Pennsylvania rock with songs such as ""Little Hell"" to soulful reflective pieces such as ""34 Winters."" This album is tight, harmonious, and professional. If you are looking for some a collection of songs that will stay in your head long after you've turned the DC player off, this one is for you. Enjoy- I am!"
5,"This book is Vivid, It is A MUST for any fan of Bob Marley!","Being a huge roots & dancehall fan of almost 7 yrs, this book is essential for any reggae collector of Bob Marley. I first enjoyed the intro by Rita Marley and the rest of the book is great. I must say that it is well-worth the moneyOne love, Jah Schreiber"
4,good,I loved this book. The pictures were very nice to look at. This book tends to focus more on Bob's music career then his personal life though. But otherwise this is a great book for all you Marley fans.
4,OKAY,"Liz Carlyle tells a good yarn and doesn't go for quick resolutions. As Historical Romances go, this isn't bad at all. Not only is the ""hero"" intriguing, but the heroine has some depth to her. I will keep reading, Liz..."
2,A disappointment,"The main characters in this novel were well developed and the plot took some interesting twists, but on the whole I found this to be one of those novels that you skim through rather than read.I found myself skipping over sentences, paragraphs, and even entire pages. There were long drawn out passages of narrative summaries that describing everything and anything in painful detail, and page after page of text without any dialogue or interaction between the characters to give it snap. There was an over abundance of internal dialogue that had the characters talking more to themselves than to each other, and a lot of secondary characters that were hard to keep track of (probably because I was skipping so much).All in all (in my opinion) not a very satisfying read."
5,"Heavy Duty mower belt - size 5/8 by 68 ""","This belt is a heavy duty belt for my riding lawn mower. The belt runs off the engine pulley and the bell housing pulley. It is probably the last belt I will have to buy for very long time. I do recommend this belt for your riding mower. The best way to buy a belt is to know the size of the belt. By knowing the size, you can shop the internet for the best price. I paid a small fraction of what the belt would have cost if I would have gone to a lawn mower shop. To find the size of your belt, you have to know two things, (1) the thickness and (2) the length. The thickness should be obvious. I is going to be either 3/8, 5/8, 1/2. The get the length, simply use a tape measure. You have to remember, you must keep enough tension on the belt for it to work properly. Find the tension adjuster on your lawn mower, and learn how to use it. I had to make a tension adjuster on my mower."
5,Classic 80's cartoon lives again!,"With Transformers, Voltron, and Robotech ruling 80's cartoons with transformable vehicles/robots, M.A.S.K. took a different spin on the theme. These vehicles turned from one form into another. The show kind of combined G.I. Joe and Transformers. The characters all wear masks that have various powers and drive vehicles that changed from one type to another, for example, Condor rides a motorcycle that turns into a mini-helicopter.This set is actually only the first season. The second season changed the format and probably is not what most people will remember watching. All of the M.A.S.K. goodness you want is here. The episodes are complete down to the bumpers and the ending moral lessons. This is a must have for 80's cartoon collectors."
2,This shows for kids,"I have seen this show when I was younger and collected the toys as well. I decided to check out some episodes and realized I don't care for it anymore. This show is for little kids, Scott and T- Bob ruins the series along with huge wipe outs and Nobody gets hurt except for the heroes plus check out episode 12 The Roteks when Matts Thunderhawk crashes and explodes. What are Venom Super Humans Since they're Vehicles explode and not one injury or scratch way too unrealistic.Even GI Joe had people getting killed,There is too many jokes same as the 80s He-Man. I could only watch a few of those since only 5 had Skeletor and the rest were all filler. M.A.S.K. would of been better if Sunbow made it since Dic makes mostly kids shows.If You want to Buy it for a Collection that's Fine But I don't advise watching this series unless your a kid or you have kids."
4,Is not the whole series,"This DVD set is missing the last 10 episodes of the show...but it says ""Complete Series"" that kinda ticked me off, I know the last 10 episodes were a little different from the 1st 65 epidodes, but still the same theme, concept, characters, actors and even some of the same vehicles from the first 65 episodes"
4,"Great, but I wouldn't call it the ""Complete"" Series","This is a great set of a classic 80's cartoon. I haven't watched the special features yet, but the episodes look really good. But I was disappointed to learn that this does not include the episodes that are considered to be from the ""Racing"" Series. Growing up, they were all the same to me and I expected them to all be included in the ""Complete"" Series box set. I thought the marketing in this case was a little disceptive on the part of the company producing this set. Now I'm waiting to buy the ""Racing"" Series if they ever decide to make it."
3,i like it its; a good movie.,"I THINK ITS A GOOD MOVIE BECAUSE ITS A OLD ONE, THOSE DAYS WAS NO SWEARING AND ITS CLEAN TO ."
1,Just plain JUNK!!!,"This machine was DOA (defective on arrival) it gets so HOT after 3 minutes use it shuts off automatically. let me repeatJust plain JUNK!!! it's dangerous!! NO Panasonic for me ever again. Panasonic customer service is the pits too..they just say ""get it fixed""this is what to expect from Panasonic :( ugh!!!"
3,Okay but needs some improvements,"I had bought a different sort of fold-up seat with 5-point restraints in 2007 for my now 6 year-old to use when we travelled. That product is no longer available, and this is all we could find. I have an Outback wagon, 1 kid in a booster and 1 in a convertible seat. I was looking for that extra ""seat"" to have when we need to transport a 3rd kid (in lieu of buying a mini-van!).It does serve that purpose, but my son complained about wearing it in the summer (and on vacation in FL), because it covers his whole chest and is hot. Also, I thought it was overpriced, but it is cheaper than another car (and fits better than any other combination of seats I tried)."
4,Little LA Inside,"I like the Small Overview City Highlight pages, + the foldout small mapswhich fits neatly into a pocket.The removable pencil & compass is neat too..to add to my collection of many City Guides!From L.A. to SanFrancisco, NYC+, to many East-Coast & European Cities.The Synopsis in each Guide really covers an area for visitors.Travelers have limited time,& wish to quickly extract what they'd like to see.Nice to see a Guide before Travel, to assist in checking off main venues."
2,a disappointment,"Very lightweight, though advertised as ""heavy gauge aluminum construction."" Not what I was looking for."
5,Mathematically rigorous but explaining physical significance,This book clearly explains the physical significance of many phenomenon and topics that we come across in this subject. The most striking feature is that it does so from the fundamental linear differential equation and gives us very good insight of the subject and a sense of completeness . Definitely its better than Oppenheim book which deals the subject a bit more mathematical.
4,just nice,"this book is realy nice, i liked because of its clear explanations and the mathematics amount is just right.this subject could get mathematically ugly very easily if the author isn't careful.the illustrations included are also very helpful.i gave this book 4 stars, because is simply didn't reach the 5 stars bar for another book i bought;written by Jack Golten ""understanding signals and systems"" it is rather is an introduction to the subject but it is realy inspiring and should be on the top of all books on this subject, i'm very sorry to write about another book while reviewing lathi's book, my main moral is to benifit students who want to understand the subject by hinting about another Guru Master."
3,Review,The book is exactly what i wanted. Only it was paper back and a bit worn but it gets the job done. Great for Psu's EE 350 and EE 351 classes
2,Too jumpy,"As a student learning about signals and systems I needed a text that would supplement the teacher's lecture and help me learn more in-depth about the topic. This text only skims the surface of every topic, as if to give a brief overview. Also, it talks about certain topics early on, but does not go further into the topic until several chapters later in the book. So several chapters later, you are jumping back and forth trying to reference the illustrations from long ago with the topic being discussed currently. Though several references were made concerning an Appendix, a thorough search of the book failed to produce one. So all of the topics that say ""go to Appendix B for further discussion"", are not covered very much at all. I only opened this book a few times, if at all, during my entire semester. It was not worth what I paid for it."
5,T3,I just recently purchased my t3 and I used it as soon as I got home. Compared to other straigteners that I haved used this one seems to be the least drying to my hair. It didn't take long to heat up and is very light. It didn't snag on my hair and slid down easily. I tried it on my mother inlaw's hair which is a lot curlier than mine and it left it very soft and straight. I have tried out some other brands and I also recommend the Chi Turbo which is also a very good straigtener. Just whatever you do don't buy those cheap ones becuase they are very bad for your hair go with the lower wattage ones.
3,"Not the best, not the worst","I had this flat iron for 4-5 years before I accidentally killed it, so for sheer lifespan it receives credit. Overall it wasn't a bad flat iron, did the job, heated up quickly, and definitely was better on my hair than a regular $30 drugstore straightener. However, if you're looking for a high quality flat iron that will also leave your hair smooth in addition to straight, this ISN'T it. My hair was much more likely to get static or look dry after using this straightener. I've now switched to a Paul Mitchell smoothing iron and it's hands down the best for my hair. This flat iron is not a bad choice, but as long as you're going to spend extra $$$, do yourself a favor and check out the Paul Mitchell tools."
4,One smal problem,"Only problem for this device, we had to order an addtional adapter to convert one male/female connection."
5,Sweet Picture,"I bought this for a bar owner for a Karaoke Moniter set up. However, we needed to split the line 3 ways to 2 LCDs and one projector. In the past I used a Cables to Go y splitter that worked well but the image would lost light. Well this spitter split the image at virtually no image loss whatsoever. At least my eye couldn't tell. one LCD was 38 feet away. I'm thinking about buying one for my self!"
5,Excellent,"This thing is fantastic. I now have excellent video quality on my desktop PC screen as well as on my 42"" TV. Very simple to use...I can't think of a single way to improve it, so I give it 5 stars."
3,"Works well, but doesn't come with a male-to-fem VGA adapter..","After I received the product, I learned that it requires a male-to-female VGA adapter or cable, which doesn't come with it."
3,A High School Physics Teacher,"I used this resource occasionally last year because the text has little in the way of problems involving math. My main complaint is the topics addressed in this workbook are often not explained covered in the text. For example, the workbook topics of static drawings, coefficient of friction, frequency/period, and angular quantities. Consequently, the student often has only the brief workbook section introduction (1/2 page) and a sample problem for reference. In my experience this is insufficent. Yes, my students can sometimes step through the problem, but doing so forces the student outside the realm of conceptual physics which is the whole idea of this course.It seems like this workbook was a too-quick attempt to throw a math resource into the course. The premise is good: the text needs more math so the student can see how math is the language of physics. But the task of introducing new topics should be left to the text."
5,Just staring out? Read this book!,"If you are a new VB programmer, or even new to programming and want to start VB. This is the book for you. It is vey understandable and easy to follow, and is full of examples. The only reason why I gave it a 9, because the CD included inside didn't have the correct picture formats to view the figures in HTML. So I do think it could have been edited one more time, for the CD reason, and for a few mistakes they made, but for being one of the forst on the market, it was great. And I still consider it the best, even though more books like it are out there."
5,"Great for beginning programmer, but not programming...","I thought this book was excellent for those who have some idea of what programming is all about, but for the complete lay-person who wants to jump into programming, this book could be a challenge, but is entirely possible for anyone semi-experienced with computers. Probably the best VB5 book so far. Would be equally as useful in learning VB6 (except the new features of course)."
4,Buy it for the IR dongle,"The only reason I purchased this remote was for the IR dongle. The PS3 is my DVD/Blu Ray player and I wanted to use it with the Harmony 880 remote but was unable to do so because the PS3 has no IR port. But the Blu Wave comes with a USB IR dongle that can receive commands from the Harmony. I taught the Harmony the proper commands from the Blu Wave and can now control the PS3 with the same remote that controls all the other devices in my entertainment center.And if you care about aesthetics, the IR attachment is barely noticeable against the black PS3. It won't distract you at all.As many others have recommended, you cannot control the PS3's power or eject discs with this remote. I don't particularly care about that, but I thought I'd mention it in case you do."
4,Works as advertised,"I bought the PlayStation 3 Blu Wave Remote to be able to control my PS3 using my Harmony 880 remote. It works exactly as advertised. It converts the IR signals and lets you control your PS3 with an IR remote. The Harmony website even had a pre-configured setting for the Blu Wave that made configuration a breeze.The only issue I have with it, is that it seems to take over the ""Player 1"" setting when you first power on the PS3. When I turn it on using either the PS3 power button, or the PS button on the controller, the controller always comes up as ""Player 2"". Turning off the controller and then turning it back on again seems to clear up the problem, though..."
4,"Connect to My Harmony 880, no problem","I bought this so that I can control my PS3 with my Universal Remote Harmony 880. I just set the learned controls for the Playstation (after setting the Playstation game selection in the Harmony setup) and had the remotes transmit to each other each command at a time. Only thing you can't do is on/off...I don't mind since I have to get up and put in the DVD anyway. Some people have had sensitivity problems, but those can be fixed via the troubleshooting process for your universal remote. You have to leave the usb fob attached to the PS3....but I've tossed the remote it came with in a box, never to use again.Hope this helps and good luck."
2,"Just okay, could be better","I don't recommend this remote unless you need the IR receiver so you can use a universal remote such as a Harmony remote. The remote control that comes in this package is very cheap feeling and also does not give you that much control over your PS3.Unless you absolutely need the IR receiver, I recommend theSony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc Remoteinstead. It gives you a PS button as well as additional buttons such as audio/subtitle and eject; all buttons that the Nyko remote does not have. Also with the Sony one, you do not need any usb dongle plugged into the front of the PS3 (which looks sorta of weird)."
2,Very Basic,"This remote is a cheap alternate if you are looking to program a Logitech Harmony or other universal remote. It provides very basic functions (stop,play,pause,etc.). It will not turn the PS3 on and off. If you want full control of your PS3 through your universal remote search for ""ir2bt"". For $55 dollars this device provides total control. All 51 codes from the ""Sony Playstation 3 Blu-ray Disc Remote"". It is a stand alone device that doesn't require the use of any of your usb ports. It took about 3 weeks to get mine but it was worth the wait."
4,The easiest way to use an IR remote with your PS3,"This remote works exactly as it is supposed to and feels like it is of higher quality than it looks.I had trouble integrating it with my Harmony remote but it works with some playing and tweaking.Strange thing is while the IR USB dongle is plugged in my standard PS3 controllers default to the 2nd controller setting every time I turn on the PS3 which is quite annoying, I have been known to unplug the IR dongle on occasion because of this.Overall this is a solid product that performs its duties well and really is the only true IR solution for the PS3 that I have seen on the market."
5,Works Perfect!,"I needed a solution that I could use with my AV system.. Since Sony in their infinite wisdom decided to do something different with their remotes this time, this device works perfectly. I simply plugged the USB device into the PS3, learned the ir codes into my universal remote and now I can control the PS3 movies with my universal remote."
2,This PS3 remote does not turn your PS3 on/off,This is a good remote for hooking up your PS3 to a universal remote control (eg: Logitech Harmony) however it does not provide the ability to turn your PS3 on or off.(This is because the remote's receiver runs off USB and USB requires power first to operate).Therefore you must either leave your PS3 on all the time or manually switch the PS3 on evertime you need to use the PS3 remote.
4,Control Freak?,"Ok, here's the scenario. You have 10 A/V components, each with a dedicated remote. To bring sanity to your family, you pony up and purchase a fancy mega control everything with one remote like a Harmony, Universal, or Pronto.After spending most of a weekend programming that new remote, you discover that you simply can't control your PS3. Why?? Sony opted to control the PS3 with Bluetooth ... NOT IR.In steps the PlayStation 3 Blu Wave Remote. This inexpensive, handy device will allow <almost> full IR control or your PS3 and will consequently allow your fancy remote to control your PS3.Note, we said ""almost."" The current firmware in Sony's PS3 ONLY recognizes Bluetooth ON/OFF commands. Translated, this 3rd party remote, will not allow you to turn your PS3 on ... or off.Works like a champ. This review has used this device on his own PS3 and has deployed this device in a number of customer custom installation jobs."
5,Works Great!,I bought this device for the infrared USB dongle. I can now control my Playstaion 3 using my Logitech Harmony One remote.
3,Comfortable remote. Flawed IR??,"This remote handles great! Buttons are big enough to navigate through. Installation is a breeze.When trying to learn the commands via my Harmony Xbox 360 remote, not all of them work properly. Not sure if i'm doing it right but it was difficult."
1,"Great, but doesn't control the power On/Off","Controls the PS3 great, except that you can not turn the PS3 on/off with this remote. You still need to get up to power on/off. Other than that, it works very well. I have integrated this with a Logitech Harmony 880 remote."
1,No Power Button!!,"Unfortunately I didn't read all of the reviews before I purchased this. I ASSUMED that a remote would come with a power button. If you use a Harmony remote like I do, then you know how great 'Activities' are. Too bad you STILL will have to turn on the PS3 using the controller or the console."
4,Finally! A way to control the PS-3 via programmable remote!,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Okay, it doesn't turn the PS-3 ""ON"" - but that's something that will only happen with an upgrade from Sony and not really a big hassle as it automatically turns itself on when you insert a disc - now we can control our entire home theater system with the Logitech Harmony One remote (this is in their data base so it's very easy to add to your activities) and the missus is one happy camper again. Bought this just for the USB ""dongle"" but it was worth every penny.I'm an ISF-certified video calibrator and just bought one of these for a client to use with the Logitech Harmony One I'm programming for his new home theater setup (Sharp 65"" 1080p LCD HDTV, TiVo Series 3 HD DVR, Sony PlayStation 3, Extron 201 AD HDMI extender, Spatz Barracuda HDMI switcher/scaler)."
4,Good for universal remotes,Works great with harmony 1000 - i only use the infra red receiver and it works with no issues with my harmony remote. A good price and quick delivery too.
4,Lazy man's remote for the PS3,"Now what was Sony thinking when they didn't do an IR remote with the PS3? Rather than go with the standard bluetooth PS3 remote, I went with the Nyko instead. And you know what, it does it's job!Pluses* Easy to install, just pop the USB dongle in* Inexpensive compared to Sony remote* Gives you all necessary blu ray controls in small form factor* Well-designed, looks like the PS3 with black and gray colorsMinuses* May take a couple of button pushes to activate connection* Another gadget on your coffee table!Overall, I'd recommend this Nyko remote, just make sure you understand what you're getting and what you're giving up..."
3,Not bad - but why go backwards in technology?,"Truthfully, this remote does what it says it does, and it isn't a horrible solution to playing movies on the PS3. The ""issue"" is that there is a *much* better solution:Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc Remote. Bluetooth so you don't need to worry about line-of-sight, intuitive for a no-brainer out of the box experience, and designed by Sony specifically for the PS3 so absolutely no issues. Returned the Blu-Wave remote, got the BlueTooth remote, never been happier."
3,Inexpensive and effective IR remote solution for PS3,"I decided to give this a try because it was relatively cheap. Works as advertised and all the controls work very well on the remote itself. Even Logitech Harmony remotes have presets on their database for the device's IR dongle, so yes this a quick and easy way to control the PS3 with your favorite harmony remote. Unfortunately, you cannot turn the PS3 on or off with IR commands because that is the nature of bluetooth so you still have to manually get up and do so."
3,Bought to use with Harmony remote,"If you have a Harmony remote and a PS3, you do have some options. For me, the expensive Harmony add-on wasn't it. The Harmony will recognize this device, but the only downside is there is no 'PS' button. That means once you enter a program, there is no way out of it. I really only use this for watching blu rays, so it's worked out well for me, but if you use other apps (Netflix, Hulu+, Youtube) and enter and exit them often, this may not be for you."
4,"Great product, but no PS button.","IR receiver and remote both work well, are of excellent quality, and are very easy to set up. The only disadvantage is there is no PS button associated with the remote. I understand that a USB dongle needs power to operate, so an on/off option via USB isn't possible, but I'd still like to be able to quit applications, which this product doesn't allow for. So other than not being able to operate power, quit applications, or anything else you'd hit the PS button for, this is a good product."
4,Great little feature,We bought this remote for the usb converter so we could use it with our universal remote. Works like a champ. The only thing you need to know is that it will NOT turn the PS3 on and off... that still has to be manual. Otherwise... works flawlessly
5,Dongle works great,I'm using the included dongle so that I can control my PS3 with my Harmony 880 remote. With just a little bit of tweaking in the Harmony software it works perfectly. I can't say anything about the Blu Wave remote as I haven't even put batteries in it.
2,Not for me,"Unfortunately this did not work for me. The dongle quit working after three days. After that it no longer worked with my Harmony 720 (with which it had worked perfectly for three days after a complicated setup - that's logitech's fault, not nyko's) or the included remote.I probably just got a dud. Happens."
3,Good and Bad. Messes up some games if left in USB,I bought this to Use with my Logitech Harmony 360 Controller.The Learned commands did not work very well and would double and triple hit. After tweaking the timing settings I got it to work.It works well with the Following Downfalls.1) No Power On Feature.2) If left plugged in all the time it will make it so you cannot play some games. I think it is because it becomes Controller 1...This was the case for some PS3 games and also for some PS2 games as well.Other than those 2 annoyances it works good.
4,Good companion for a universal IR remote,I have a Logitech Harmony 555 and wanted that IR receiver to control the PS3 too. This works just fine. The IR receiver even does not look as ugly as I expected when connected to the PS3. Only feature lacking : ability to turn on the PS3... And maybe the PS button too (center of the standard sixaxis controller)
4,Does what i need it to,"i bought this product after reading that it does allow limited control with the harmony. i bought it and it did exactly what i thought it would. it gives you all the basic functions, which is really all i need. i dont like using the sony blu-tooth controller cuz the buttons are too small and do not light up.it did take a little while to get the remote to work exactly how i needed it to but in the end im happy with it being able to let me use my harmony to control the ps3 for watching movies."
4,Works as intended.,"There isn't much to say on this. It is a remote and it acts as a remote just fine.It feels a little cheap (and at this price, it is) but it's not like I hold this thing 24/7 or use it very often. It really only sees use for maybe 2 minutes while a movie is being prepared to watch.Much better purchase than most other alternatives if you ask me, best bang for the buck.I rated the game fun low because this isn't a game."
3,Lack of a power button is a major flaw,"This is a useful product to allow you to use your Logitech Harmony or other IR remote, but the lack of a power button really restricts the overall usefulness.I opened the package, plugged in the IR receiver to the Playstation 3, and taught my Logitech Harmony remote all of the commands in about 5 minutes. It works like a champ. There is no lag in the PS3 receiving the commands, and without the touchiness of the PS3 controller's buttons. However, having no equivalent for the power button is a major flaw. It really takes away from the ability to have an all in one remote solution. Other than that, I'm very satisfied with the item."
3,"If all you want is a piece of fabric in your pocket, it's a deal","Most of the edges were rough, as though these were the seconds of a pricer brand. After a few washes they look fine."
2,Awful,"Good seller/service but these handkerchiefs are poorly made. They are like snowflakes, no 2 alike. All have something wrong after washing. Loose threads (see picture), out of square (see picture), crumpled.They look great out of the package - perfect in fact. That changes after 1 washing - after 2 they weren't any better, worse in some cases.I do not recommend these. Go to Kohls or any place that sells Dockers brand, they are 10x better. Thicker cotton, tighter weave, bigger size. $12 for 9 pure cotton white, $12 for 6 blue plaid (3 royal blue, 3 gray-blue). The plaid ones are a little bigger. Kohls price is Retail - mine were on sale, 30% less.Don't waste your money on these. Mine are going to Good Will or rag bag. Oh, to be fair, a few of these hankies are fine (not frayed, etc) - but the entire package should be that way."
4,Hard to find in stores.,Handkerchiefs are hard to find in many stores. These handkerchiefs look good after going through the washer and dryer and do not require ironing.
4,GOOD QUALITY AND SIZE,ORDERED 2 PKGS FOR MY HUSBAND AND HE IS VERY HAPPY. THEY ARE LARGE AND WASH UP VERY WELL.
4,Great tracks,"Although I love the songs, I cringe at the transitioning. I expected the mixing to be more professional. Overlooking that aspect, Farina's selections are wonderful. I still love the CD enough to give it a good rating."
4,"A smooth flowing DJ mix with spicy, upbeat samples","Though the transitions between the numbers are somewhat cacophonous (two songs playing at once in different keys), the album succeeds in creating a sophisticated and energized feel. The bonus interactive CD that makes the user the DJ is fun, and makes the title worth every penny."
4,A great late-night party mix,"DJ Mark Farina shows off his smoooooth skills on this treat of a CD. Many of the cuts to me sound more ""soul"" than ""jazz"", but this in no way detracts from the jazz vibe. The second bonus disc is a multimedia CD-ROM that works on both Macs and Windows."
2,Not outstanding,"I ran out and got this album after hearing a DJ friend sample track 2 off of it. The album turned out to be homogenous and unimpressive in my opinion. The tracks meld together in an awkward manner and the production is poor enough that I noticed, and I don't know a lot about production."
3,"""Practise make perfect""","I do not know what the story is with this guy DJ MARK FARINA guy but his choice of tracks for this compilation MUSHROOM JAZZ is superb but the mixing suck on this first volume in the series. If you go for any of the following editions you still get the excellent tracks and the mixing have improved considerably. A typical case of ""Practise make perfect""!5 Stars for the selection of tracks and 1 for the mixing only give a total of 3.ALL of the later editions are 5 star masterpieces..."
3,"pretty good, i guess.","for house fans in chicago, mark farina is one of the slamminest, but i still haven't figured out why. the same goes for mush jazz. it's pretty cool, but at times he picks the wackest track that ultimately ruins a good thing. even though i question his track selection sometimes (at clubs and on mixtapes from gramaphone, chicago), he sure does have awesome mixing skills!"
2,Sophomoric mix of awesome tracks,"Get the vinyl of this if you can!!!!! THen you can mix it how you wish. The mixing on this CD is less than desirable. The music gets you in such a groove, but the mixing, or lack there of frustrates thehell out of you. Level adjustments during the playing of tracks totally inexcusable. Mr. Farina, I know you can do better, much better than this. Once again, get the vinyl. More tracks and all in their entirety. The music gets 5 stars, but the mixing got -8 stars."
4,Nice book!,"This polymer clay book is well written and intended for crafters of any age. The autor leaves place to imperfections and fantasy. Even beginners, with a little patience and imagination, can create any of these projects. This book is not as good as others from Maureen Carlson, Sue Heaser or late Robert McKinley, but each artist has his (her) own way of expression and readers will understand that using this book. Good luck everyone!!!"
4,The Cover is a Good Judge of What to Expect,"I was hoping for some cute, pretty and refined characters. But all the characters are much like the cover: Funny looking, cartoon-like characters. The author is talented and the explanations and illustrations are good. Unique and creative comical characters!"
5,Loved this book,"I have many polymer clay books, but when I saw this book, I knew I had to have it. The cover was cute enough, but when I saw the view from inside with the little bird, I was hooked. This book is hard to find, and even on ebay, it was like a gazillion dollars. Loved it. Can't wait to try the projects. Thanks"
4,Near-Perfect Resource,"This is the most complete collection of signs and definitions. If only it was updated more frequently. Users must be careful to read all the descriptions and cross reference with other sources, like on-line dictionaries.All languages change, but ASL changes more rapidly than others. Think of the many images and types of telephones just over the last 10 years. Most phones don't even have cords anymore. Signs reflect the visual change in the world around us. The most modern sign for phone, or many other concepts, may not be listed accurately in this printed dictionary."
1,Can't Recommend This ASL Dictionary,"Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book. More than 60 percent of the signs I got out of it were rejected as wrong or outdated by Deaf persons and ASL teachers and interpreters. it was a big disappointment, because of the cost. Better choice is the ""Handshape Dictionary."""
5,fairly accurate and complete.,"Most of the words I looked up were in this book. It includes religious, sexual, some slang, and many other signs frequently ignored in other books. If an english word has several meanings or if there are several signs for the same word they are in here. If a sign has several meanings, that is noted. The illustrations which are accompanied by directions are also pretty easy to follow. Though the signs sometimes differed to what I've seen commonly used, they were usually accurate. This book is limited by the fact that it only a dictionary and if you want to learn ASL you must learn it through use, a course, or another book.Overall, I highly recommed this book. It is probably the best book of sign language I have seen."
4,A GREAT REFERENCE !,I decided to learn sign language with absolutely no background in the subject. No book could list EVERY sign for EVERY word but this book covers almost every word I was looking for. It would take more than this book alone to get skilled at ASL but this book is an excellent teaching reference. I highly recommed it to anyone who desires to learn sign language. It is more than just talking with your hands. It is a wonderful form of expression.
2,"Many words, but out of date","All Languages change, and Sign Language is no exception. I feel that this book is a little out of date."
2,American Sign Language,"I purchased this dictionary in hopes of it helping me sign songs for church because it is paired with American Sign Language: Hymns for Signing. And I enjoyed the book until I tried to look up words that began with ""E."" The whole ""E"" section of the dictionary is missing--the problems are obvious."
5,Best ASL Book,This is one of the best ASL books I've used. The dictionary gives you great images and descriptions of the actual movements of your hands and facial expressions. This is a must get book for any level.
5,Ten star book,"This is a rarity of a book since it doesn't spend a lot of time telling you stuff you don't need to know, but is what it says. A book about the various means of composting whether you live in an apartment or have an acre for an organic vegetable or flower garden.The illustrations are helpful and easy to follow. And if you think you cant compost or that it will just be to hard, this book will change your mind. It is also an important book in my opinion, because Americans throw away so much useful compost material or grind it down the kitchen garbage disposal. By composting your kitchen and garden wastes you not only produce rich soil but you build up the entire eco system. And with garbage dumps becoming full and new ones harder to find I think that composting of kitchen and garden wastes should be a law."
5,Wonderful film,"This is a magnificent film, based on the novel by Angeles Mastretta. Superb acting and photography. Captures a period of Mexico's history brilliantly and deals with universal themes. A must-see."
4,Satisfied,"The Video was of good quality. the Movie was great. Although, it did not have English subtitles."
4,Version pictured here does not have English Subtitles,"There seems to be a version of this movie around somewhere that has English Subtitles but the one pictured here only has Spanish and Portuguese.Of course the Audio is Espanol.Anyway I've given it the average stars of the other reviews here, to be able to post this info, as I'm sure it would be quite a good movie."
4,Arrancame La Vida,"Much better than I thought it would be! The acting was pretty good. It might be a little too sexy, but it didn't bother me nor my wife. Amazon is our choice."
2,Not the whole book.,"I was disappointed when I received the book. Bernard Devos edited a collection of MT's late writings entitled _Letters from the Earth_, and that's what I expected. What I received was just those essays comprising ""Letters from the Earth"" that comprised a small part of the book. It did not include ""Etiquette at a Funeral"", ""The Awful German Language"", ""Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses"", ""On Repentance"", and a number of other superb essays and stories."
3,Don't confuse this with other editions,"Just be careful: as of this writing, Amazon is mixing together reviews that describe at least two different books. The Greenbook Publications edition, dark green with a small photo of the author on the cover, is 52 pages long and includes ONLY ""Letters from the Earth."" It's marred by typos (though I didn't find as many as other reviewers) and seems overpriced.Many of the reviews attached to this same item clearly refer to a different book which contains both ""Letters from the Earth"" and an assortment of other writings. I'd suggest you look for that edition."
3,Letters from the Earth,some of the words were hard to understand and I had to look up in a dictionary Letters from the Earth
2,Sad,It was a difficult read. The book reflects the pain and bitterness felt by the author at the end of his life.
4,"Hard to find item, easy to find on Amazon!",This book was a gift and we had it sent to another address. No fault of Amazon's but the book delivery is very slow. The recipient assured us it is in fine shape and she is very happy with it. She says it's a very interesting perspective on the topic and is good for anyone trying to expand their knowledge.
5,Way ahead of his time,"As much as I enjoyed his more famous books, it is actually this work that makes him even more genius to me. I was totally taken aback. His opinions on religion and the hypocrosy of it all were almost exactly as mine as I read along. I thought that no one was like that... let alone back then... but indeed he was. To know that such a great man felt the same way as I did regarding the Bible and human behavior brings me great comfort.I only wish he were alive so I could personally thank him."
4,"If you hated church, you'll love this book!","Twain describes for us (through the character of Satan) how boring the Christian heaven is: lots of singing and playing on harps, but no sexual intercourse! Satan, you devil."
3,Gotta Love Mark Twain...,"The first 107 pages of this book are very interesting, but the rest is not. I bought it because I thought the whole book would be Mark Twain's irreverent but so witty take on the Bible, and yes the beginning is exactly that! As long as you are aware of this, you won't be disappointed."
4,"Some wins, some losses.","I first read this book when it was first published as a posthumous surprise. At the time it was just that. Some of the sections would never have been accepted during his lifetime and were still a bit edgy. Now after many years, I think it is a collection of things he wrote for his own pleasure in working out his more unconventional (for the time)opinions but that he never expected to let his public see. I still think it is for the most part brilliant satire but parts of it either weren't funny or were just beyond my comprehension. It's still well worth reading.pat c"
5,great,i loved it and i liked how long it was every one should take the time to read some of Mark Twan's stuff
2,Careless with Content--a Shoddy Product--Don't Buy it,"As a poor grad student, I was drawn to the low price of this book; as cheap as it was, however, I didn't get my money's worth. There were numerous typos throughout the text, and the layout itself (inside and out) is careless and unprofessional. Without any supporting scholarly materials or book history (besides the slight inaccurate and poorly edited blurb on the back), it is a no better than what one might find online.Finally, IT IS INCOMPLETE. The book advertises, on its cover, additional stories that ARE NOT included. Do not spend your money on this book. There are better versions out there. Buy those."
3,Book review,Easy to read book but too simplistic for my tastes. Therefore found it somewhat disappointing. Still enjoy Mark Twain's writing though he is interesting.
5,Great compilation for a great group -Long live Dead Can Dance!,"Dead Can Dance's music has managed to survive after the group's death. In spite of belonging to a different time and century, it still retains the same spirit it had back when we first heard them. This compilation of the best of their work can only be blamed for the same problem that most compilations have: it does not have enough space to house all the great work they recorded. But it allows newcomers into their music to get a feel for their medieval-meets-ethnic approach, and realize what they've been missing. Past that point, there is no resort but going back and getting their entire catalog. Long live Dead Can Dance!"
3,Only if you haven't heard them before...,"This is simply another collection of songs from previous works and if you have not heard this wonderful group before, then dive in by all means. Established fans will know that this is just another marketing ploy to squeeze some more buck$ out. Personally, I would recommend the live ""Toward the Within"" CD as a good overview, if only because the live feel of the sound gives it a greater immediacy."
1,Geometria Sagrada NO DEBERIA SER EL TITULO !!!,"Leyendo la descripcion del editor en la version en ingles (ya que en espaniol no la hay) yo esperaba un libro introductorio donde realmente hubiera un estudio sobre la geometria sagrada, simbolos presentes en algunas tecnicas de curacion como el Reiki, y lo que esto presenta sencillamente es una lista de unas pocas (no llegan a 20) formas geometrias con una MUY leve explicacion de como realizar esa geomtria.... parece mas un libro para dibujantes que realmente para cubrir un tema holistico tan importante... de hecho, no existe un analisis desde el punto de vista holistico.!!!! este libro NO DEBERIA TENER ESE TITULO."
2,Nothing happens,"All excited to read the third installment of the Odd series, as I waded through I kept wondering ""When is something going to happen?"" but it never does. Even the ending is flat and dull. Such a pity. It could have been a fascinating story but, instead, we got page after page of descriptions of bodachs and snow. Not one of Koontz' best."
3,Great Character; Not Too Good a Plot,"I think the quirky Odd Thomas to be the most like-able character in Dean Koontz novels. He's believable & I love the tongue in cheek humor. The story, I found, really bogs down in places. I also thought the plot to be a bit over the top. If not for the humor exuded by Thomas & his Russian ally I think the book would fail. The plot just doesn't cut it. Elvis's history is out of place with Thomas being such a young character as well. Thomas just can't carry the plot in this one"
1,"Brother Odd, mighty boring","Odd Thomas was good. This book was boring. I have read at least 10 books by Dean Koontz. This was the only book I thought of putting down before finishing. After this one, I am not sure about Forever Odd. If I get it, I will give it 50 pages and decide whether to move on or not."
2,Get this man an editor!!!,"I've never been so annoyed while reading a Dean Koontz novel. Odd Thomas is completely unbelievable (we all suspend belief a little bit, but I can't do it THIS much...) and the way the narration goes on and on and on and on is absolutely astounding to me. Any entry level writing course advises to keep it short and simple. Descriptions don't have to be long and wordy to get the point across. The way he continuously over-describes almost everything in the book detracts from the story. Where the heck is his editor??"
3,"I love this series, but!",Not Mr. Koontz's best work. The premise is great but the story falls short. I would still buy his next book though.
3,3.5 Stars... lacking on the plot,"I definitly enjoyed this read. Odd is such a great character and the book sucked me in rght from the beginning. Koontz has a great chartacter here, i just wish the plot of the overall story amongst all his Odd books would have more meaning. I keep wishing for them to mold together into some larger plot but it doesn't appear to be happening. I'd like to understand more of this dark creatures that appear in most every book, where do they come from, what are they? Will there be a bigger picture? I suppose this is my fault for placing my expectaions on the series, but oh well.With that said this was a fun read. I enjoyed the creepiness of this book more so than in the others. However, i thought the ending was a bit tacky but still worth reading.If you are into the Odd series that you know as much as i do that you will need to read this book. They are so hard to put down. Overall, enjoyable read, but still left me wishing for a little more."
3,"Better than ""Forever Odd"" but not as good as ""Odd Thomas""","I may be one of the few who feel this way, but I don't think the sequels are anywhere near as good as the first one. I really didn't care for ""Forever Odd"" at all, and I only felt that ""Brother Odd"" was marginally better. I think that for me, the problem with the sequels is that there isn't enough going on; it's just Odd thinking and moving around. I think that Dean Koontz shines better when he has more secondary characters interacting with the main character, and I say this as a woman who has read every book published by Mr. Koontz, and he is one of my favorite authors.And to anyone who wants to make negative comments about this review I say to you: back off and get a life. The purpose of writing MY review is to give MY opinion of the book and I don't need or want any feedback on my opinion. Write your own review and give your opinion there..."
3,Didnt keep my attention.,I noticed that this one didnt keep my attention like the other ones. I kept putting it down and losing interest. The character Odd is a facinating one. This book however was a little drawn out. Lingered too much on irrelevant things. I enjoyed his other books much better. I was a little disapointed in this one. I still think Koontz is a great story teller and will always be.
1,Please DO something!,I love the premise. I love the characters. I love the writing style. I love the banter and easy good humor. I love the stability of the protagonist. If only there were a story or a plot you could make a good book out of all these. Reading it was like having insomnia and staring at a digital clock that never advances.
3,Koontz is Always a pleasant read,"I have really enjoyed The Odd Thomas series. This one starts out strong and with some great writing, in Koontz style. but at times it drags and fails to keep my interest. With that said I still like reading Koontz and his writing is at times beyond great pulling you in with amazing visual description. I will keep reading the series and look forward to more."
1,Dan Koontz' Brother Odd,"I have read all of Dean Koontz' novels and sorry to say ""Brother Odd"" was, by far, the worst. Although my goal is to read every one of his, it was a struggle getting through this one. Fitting in a multitude of characters by making them religious brothers just made no sense and having them be experts in certain timely things made even less sense. Sorry Dean, but you really didn't do well on this one."
2,Brother UGH,"I would give "" ODD THOMAS"" 4 stars: solid characterization, solid fast paced plot. FOREVER ODD had fewer characters(and they were boring)and a much slower story (there really wasnt much of a story; ODD THOMAS walking around underground...wow). I would give FOREVER ODD 2 stars. BROTHER ODD fares slightly better than the second mainly because the second one was so boring it was easier to improve upon. There are more characters in BROTHER ODD and boy are they eccentric as always.UGH...I know Odd Thomas is special but does EVERYONE have to posses a special talent or a deformity? Boring plot about quantum mechanics mixed in with Dean's favorite subject God. The Odd Thomas story should be put to bed..its over."
2,"Oh my my my, Brother Odd","Well I am a great fan of Dean Koontz. I read almost all of his novels. I loved Odd Thomas, and I thought Forever Odd was good. Lots of action. The storylines follow along possible real-life events that may happen in this world. So when I found out that Dean Koontz wrote a third book I was very excited. I wondered what was going on in Odd's life now. However now that I finished the book, i am a bit disappointed.This is obviously my own opinion but it had too much Science Fiction. Too much Quantum Physics. Too many far-fetched ideas. The dialogue between Odd and the russian lasted too long about things that, for me, were a pain in the rear to follow. I know Odd needs to grow and his stories need to be different from the last to keep interest, but i say keep the story lines in the supernatural/real life arenas and not stray off to these science/physics stories where it's just too unbelievable.My advice, get it from the library."
4,Another compelling Odd,"Another funny yet suspenseful Odd Thomas. I can't wait to read the next one. So well written, Odd seems like someone I'd like to hang out with."
5,Brother Odd,"An outstanding book by Mr Koontz. I read it 3 times faster than I normally read a book, because I didn't or couldn't put it down. A 2006 Large Print edition, with jacket and read only once by me. No bent corners & no markings. Ships USPS Book Rate."
1,Oh brother....,"Odd Thomas was pretty good. Forever Odd was OK. This book bites. Dull, predictable, a ""so what?"" ending, no suspense, no surprise, no reason to turn the page at all.Koontz bloats this book with his religious ranting and simplistic ""oh those darling challenged children,"" and blah-blah blah blah.This is the last Koontz book I will read."
4,good read. Thought provoking,Fast paced fiction that is an easy read that leaves you thinking about all of the moral and spiritual questions that the author sneaks in on you. I am truly enjoying the Odd Thomas books and can't wait for the next to come out.
5,I Liked This One Better Than The Second Book,"I liked this book. The first one was, in my opinion the best of the series, but I really liked this one too. It brought some scientific and theoretical ideas to the table, which I always like. The mood is always so atmospheric and the characters are always out-there and well detailed. The particular ""evil"" that Odd faces is quite interesting. Odd's journey continues well."
3,weakest of the series,"I loved the Odd Thomas series and this one is quite enjoyable, because I like the main character and and the writing style. I love that there is plenty of humor interspersed throughout. But this is the weakest of the 3 in the series. The story goes on a slow build that just falls flat. Like someone else said, they spend so much time fortifying the orphanage against an impending doom, but the horror is only directed at one individual such that all that fortification was not necessary. Koontz can do so much better than that and has done in other novels. Also, the ultimate explanation of how the monsters were created was weak compared to what Koontz is capable of. If you are a Koontz fan or an Odd Thomas fan, definitely don't miss it. But if you are neither, don't read this--read the original ""Odd Thomas"" novel. I hope he continues to write Odd novels and makes them better than this one."
5,An Ode to Odd,"A poem for Odd Thomas, with sincerest apologies to 'real' poets everywhere. :o)Me and you and a dog named Boo in a monasterydeep in the Sierra NevadaWhere winter nips at the windows and fear makesyour heartbeat dance the LambadaIcy fingers run down your spinewhen you spy something withoutThat should not, CANNOT exist, yetis roaming the grounds of this dark redoubtSo you muster your courage and go into battle...as you are designed to do no lessTo protect the innocent with the aid of monksand a plucky abbessBecause you are Odd Thomas--barely a man at twenty-one--But who cares about age when there's work to be done?"
5,Odd Thomas is still charming,"I finished Brother Odd, the third of 7 promised Odd Thomas books :)How to be objective when you are already enchanted by the main character?Odd Thomas still has the personality that has captivated the author and his fans; so that is not a disappointment. The book starts interesting enough to keep you reading; it gets a bit long in the middle where it builds up expectations for the grand finale, therefore it is hard to put it down. The end is as expected, a great ending to a classic Koontz tale; although it has its thumbs ups and downs. I don't want to ruin it for anyone planning on reading it, but you will know what I mean when you are done with it. I am excited to get started on book 4 and recommend this to any Odd Thomas fans."
4,"Wonderful characters, some heavyhanded religiosity","Like everyone else here, I love the character Odd Thomas, and agree that this book is a vast improvement over Forever Odd. As good as the first in the series, Odd Thomas, imo. Odd is just so sweet and funny that it's really an uplifting read.I also enjoyed the other characters here. The plot was pretty good, albeit secondary in quality to the delightful characters.My only complaint? There's quite a bit of what comes across as proselytizing. ""There's no way science can investigate the existence of God""...? That notion is laid on pretty thick, even taking into consideration the monastery setting.Nonetheless, it's quite a bit of fun."
3,Maybe my hopes were too high?,"This book is...decent. Only read this because I read the first and second, and thought I HAD to read this one. If I could do it all over again, I would read the original (Odd Thomas) and just stop there."
3,MONK Y BUSINESS,"The third in Koontz's Odd Thomas series is a mixed blessing. One can see how much Koontz must like his leading character: Odd Thomas is a well-written and likeable guy, whose narrative skills are what keeps the story moving. Koontz uses humor a lot in this series and for the most part, effectively.The problem with this entry is its meandering pace and a storyline that just isn't that intriguing or plausible. The supporting characters of the monks and nuns are well done and the mysterious Russian librarian is a good addition. Overall, though, it's a little too repetitive and not as chilling as it should have been."
1,Oddly lame,"Not worth the paper its printed on. Quantum claptrap already used in dozens of books.Really thin on character development and please, can someone smack Thomas out of his whining?I can't believe I will probably read the next one!! but nothing about dogs! enough of the golden retrievers already... about a Pitt or a Chihuaha?"
2,Brother Odd -,"While the first Odd Thomas will go down as one of my favorite books, Brother Odd left me wary. Humorous at times and thoughtful the book makes promises but never delivers. If you build an army you must fight and the fight has to be explosive. It's like Dean Koontz is writing this stuff on a whim and chickens out at the end. Come on this is Dean Koontz, author of Intensity and Velocity let it rip man....."
2,Disappointing...Had higher hopes for this series,"Brother Odd is the third in the series of Dean Koontz's novel about a paranormal man. Personally I liked the series & character of Christopher Snow better, the man with a rare genetic disorder that leaves him vulnerable to light. Something about living your waking hours in the night in Moonlight Bay--wonderful supporting characters. Have read those 3 novels many times & enjoyed the writing every time. Anyway, I would rate the 1st 2 novels of Odd much higher than Brother Odd...seems like he was stretching both the plot & character of this book...beyond my interest level. Not sure if I'll bother rereading this one. Others may like but it's not up to Koontz's best standard."
1,First and last Koontz book I'll read,"I got the audio version of this from the library, and it's my first exposure to Koontz' writing. It will be my last. I got so bored I stopped listening after about halfway through. The language is way too flowery and overly descriptive, at the expense of developing anything exciting or suspenseful. After all those chapters, all that had really happened was that Brother Odd had a premonition of a disaster at the monastery where he's living, and a monk has gone missing, presumed dead. The book just plods along as if you're going in slow motion, waiting for something interesting to happen. Koontz seems more interested in seeing how many different ways he can describe the ferocity of a blizzard that has been raging throughout the story than actually developing an intriguing plot. I kept telling myself come on, let's get on with it, but one can only take so much torture. Extremely disappointing."
5,Keep Em Coming!,"Brother Odd lived up to and I think exceeded the other Odd Thomas books. It kept me turning the pages and neglecting my work until I could devour it all. The only problem with a wonderful page turner is figuring out what to read after you've zipped to the end. All I can say is keep em coming. As a general rule, books tend to peter out after the second sequel, but the Odd Thomas books just get better and better. I can't wait for the next one."
5,A great continuation of the series.,"This book was even more entertaining than the other 2 in the series. A great combination of mystery, humor, and entertainment. I can hardly wait for the next book in the series."
5,Koontz is back on track,"Koontz introduced the loveable and intriguing character of Odd Thomas in his first book. The follow up book ""Forever Odd"" seemed to step away from what was so well liked about ""Odd Thomas."" I was relieved to see that Koontz brought the character back to life in ""Brother Odd."" I can't wait to read the next book in the series."
3,Huh,"Okay, let's put it out there: the plot is ridiculous, contrived, and quite thin. The supporting characters aren't exactly fully developed ... most of them feel more like sketches than anything else.So why did I give this book three stars? It's the voice. In the hands of any other writer, this book would have fallen apart like my mom's lasagne. But it didn't. I kept reading because I really enjoyed the narrator's dry wit, the clever little descriptions, and the way Koontz can move effortlessly from one thing (say, a little girl in a hospital bed) to another (three men in porkpie hats beating our hero senseless with a 10 pound bratwurst). Several times I had to go back and re-read the pages, thinking, whoa, how did he do that?Koontz reminds me of Stephen King. Talk about polishing a turd, these guys can turn poo into gold.Anyway, it was an entertaining book despite its flaws. I wish I could write like this."
5,Brother Odd by Dean Koontz,I have really enjoyed the continuing saga of Odd Thomas. Brother Odd is a fun book with lots of suspense and adventure. I loved it!
5,Whimsical and fun to read,"This is the third book Koontz has written about Odd, and if you liked the other two, you'll like this one as well. Odd has left the little city where he lived all his life to stay as a guest at an abbey. The abbey, funded by an excentric scientist who abandoned his former life to become a monk, seems a place of peace. But then Odd notices the chilling arrival of bodachs, who hover around the bed of a handicapped child.What the heck are bodoachs? Odd doens't really know, which is part of the fun. In fact, what can you call these books? They're far from the other thrillers Koontz wrote. They really are not quite like any other book I've ever read. Yet his writing is so whimsical and amusing they can't be put down. Where else can you read: "" If we were capable of thinking of everything, we would still be living in Eden, rent-free with all-you-can-eat buffets and infinitely better daytime TV programming""."
3,Not as good as the first but still good,"Ok, so this book is definately not as great as the first but it is still pretty entertaining."
3,Have to agree with...,"I have to agree with DYB's ""... Oh Sigh ..."" review, and others who feel that this latest (third) installment in the 'Odd Thomas' saga just doesn't hold up very well to the original. Although I DO think it was decidedly better than the second (""Forever Odd""). Like the second, it builds to a climax that is a bit sudden... Not disappointing exactly, but it leaves the reader shaking his or her head and thinking ""is that all there is?"" I guess that just sets the hook for the next in the series...As I've said before: Average for Koontz is still a fine read for those of us looking to escape into a world of mystery, supernaturalism and engaging characters (including Dogs!).Keep 'em coming, Dean. :-)"
4,Odd Thomas as sweet as Forrest Gump,"Odd Thomas is living in a monestary. He enjoyes the monks and nuns, and for a while he has peace with a dog named boo and Elvis the the King of Rock and Roll.One day, in the children's quarters he see's those harbringers of doom, the Bodachs.They always signal violence and death,.Sure enough, a monk ends up missing and Odd trips over him,When they find him later, he is changed and demonic.Odd feels the clock is ticking down to finding out who is behind the evil and why did they call it into being?"
2,"Mediocre, I'm sorry to say","One of the problems with Brother Odd is that very little happens until the end. There's a great deal of character-setting and the occasional skirmish with an evil entity. It's a bit like an under-funded off-Broadway play with the same set throughout, trying hard with clever but often meaningless dialogue to make up for its shortcomings. It made me wonder just how long it took the very prolific Mr Koonz to write this book. I'd bet on a few weeks."
2,Likable hero vs. weird monster,"OK. I really enjoyed the first two Odd Thomas books, but this one's just not as good. Odd leave his hometown for a Catholic retreat, and bumps his way around a snowbound weird murder mystery. There's an bony monster sprung from unconvincing quantum theory that slumps around a not too exciting plot. Odd is still a very likable hero and there's some nifty and memorable one liners. Koontz does have a nice turn of phrase here and again, but the lack of excitement in this thriller... lead to my 2 star rating."
3,My 100-word book review,"Brother Odd is the third book in Koontz's series, which started with the excellent Odd Thomas, and it is the weakest yet. There are some good touches (I liked the snowbound monastery and found the monstrous apparitions intriguing) but the novel is let down by a poor plot, has an unsatisfactory resolution and on occasion Koontz's trademark humour gets in the way. There is also some rather heavy-handed moralising, which seems out of character for Odd. A shame really, as the premise underlying these stories is a good one. I hope the fourth book will mark a return to form."
3,Brother Odd,B-Think these CD's are defective. Just the last or second to last paragraph of each chapter was defective.
3,Good not great,"Any Koontz novel is worthing reading. Not his best work. Not even his best Odd Thomas book. Of course ""Odd Thomas"" (the first in series) is pretty hard act to follow. I thought it was better than the second in the series but by no means was it up there with ""Intensity"" (which may be the best/scarriest book ever written). All in all it's a Dean Koontz book so it better than most out there."
1,Boring,Odd Thomas bores me to tears. I had to force myself to finish these books (since I'd bought them) but couldn't get over how all the characters sound just alike. They all have the same sense of humor. I can't get a feel for Odd Thomas at ALL. Half the time he sounds sarcastic. Half the time he's this annoyingly respectful sounding guy. He just never comes to life.There's no cleverness in these Odd Thomas tales.
1,Brother Odd,I love Dean Koontz books and have read all of them but this is the worse. I was very disappointed with this story. I think that Odd Thomas has run his course and Mr. Koontz should move on to other story lines.
2,Way To Odd A Story,This book was a real disappointment. It took all I had to even finish it. Very boring and dull.
3,a bit preachy,"I find that Dean is getting a bit preachy in his old age. In this book, he goes off on a few rants against those who may disagree with religion. And he seems to have a bit of a disdain for science as well.I've found similar social commentary in ""The Taking"" and ""One Door Away from Heaven"""
2,Odd,I did not enjoy this book at all. I continued to read it hoping it would get better but it didn't
2,"Magnesium Great, Wheat not advertised a Real Problem","This product, Source Naturals 100 mg Magnesium, usually trustworthy, is not adequately described by the company selling it to include the fact wheat is a part of the Magnesium pills, even though the bottle states it very clearly. I didn't know until I'd received the bottle.I'm sensitive to wheat gluten, making this a horrible product for me, would've appreciated knowing ahead of time.Shipping costs were unreasonably high, too, and that wasn't clear until just before confirming my order. Having taken so much time, I just rolled my eyes, dreading having to shop some more, and hit ""ok.""Bad desriptions make the company selling this SN product unreliable. Source Naturals continues to be a reliable source of supplements, but, find a company sensitive to the needs of too sensitive people to describe products fully and appropriately."
5,FOR THE PERSON WHO LIKES TO HIT GOLF BALLS,"For the past five or six years I have read the leading golf magazines and numerous books about golf. This is the best instructional material I have read. The concept of the full swing was easy for me to understand and I appreciated the way Rick Smith dispelled many of the myths we've associated with the golf swing.This book is for the person, like me, who likes to hit golf balls. I know I have improved my swing and lifted my confidence level as a result of reading this book.I'm reading it now for the third time.Thank's Rick"
4,very insightful instruction,The book has done a good job of dispelling certain myths about the golf swing. I read every golf book that comes along and think that this book is similiar to the book GOLF IS A WOMAN'S GAME. Both books address myths about the golf swing. A suggestion.. if you liked this book try GOLF IS A WOMAN'S GAME both books are a one two punch
2,Far to complicated for (any) the average golfer,I consider myself a student of the game and have read many thoughts on how to play your best golf. This book (while I am sure fundamentally sound) would take a physics background and a full time golf coach to implement the many ideas presented in this book. I would avoid this book unless you enjoy a good migraine headache.
1,If i could i would give it 1/2 stars,"This movie is the worst Jamaican movie ever. It makes Top Shottas look like Scarface. The ""story"", ""acting"" an ""action scenes"" were all laughable. If your a real fan of Jamaican films save your money or invest it in ""Smile Orange"", ""The Harder They Come"", ""Third World Cop"" or ""Dancehall Queen"" or even ""Top Shotta""."
2,"HAS SOME DECENT ACTING, BUT...","A REGGAE MUSICIAN BEGINS TO DEAL DRUGS FOR A DRUG KINGPIN SO HE COULD GET THE MONEY FOR STUDIO TIME. HAS A DECENT PLOT, BUT MOST OF THE ACTING ISN'T GOOD, AND MOST OF THE CHARACTERS WERE JUST CLICHED CHARCTERS THAT YOU'D USUALLY SEE A JAMAICAN ACTOR PLAY. I DO AGREE THAT THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF THINGS TO LAUGH AT WHEN WATCHING THIS MOVIE. NOT THE WORST OF ITS KIND, BUT, I DON'T THINK ITS REALLY WORTH BUYING."
2,Phony Mafia - Big man never kills,"Very disappointing movie. It look like a low budget Miami Vice episode. Character flaw: The Big Man, i.e., Mafia Boss mames and kills people with his own hands. Oh yeah, it's a movie."
4,Great Compilation,"This comp was (inexpensive) and it had some bands I'd heard of when I bought it. Then I listened to it. The Alkaline Trio songs are catchy and a bit dark, but still poppy. The Get Up Kids had a re-hash of I'm a Loner... which is alright and a weird brand new song, which I don't like. Saves the Day have two darn good songs, one of which is new. The Anniversary, being the best band ever, had the best two songs on the comp, including the epic 8.5 minute closer I Believe that the End of the Reign of Terror is Soon Near. I don't care for the Gotohells or Rocket From the Crypt, two bands that don't fell like they belong because of their more punk rock style. A great buy for any punk/emo fan. rock on."
3,All the decent bands Vagrant stole (expect the Anni.),"Man this actually has some good songs on it, like Saves the Day before they got really really bad, good Alkaline Trio, the last song by the Anniversary and that RFTC song are pleasant to the soul. Yeah this is Vagrant records at thier best, before they went around stealing every hot ""emo"" band in the world. I do like that last Anni. song though!"
1,Worst album ever!,"What the hell is this! This music is HORRIBLE! I mean, I like punk rock, but this is so bad I can't even laugh!"
1,Not 1 micron.,"The item says ""1 MICRON"" in huge yellow letters, under that a in blue smaller print ""2 LAYERS NOMINAL FILTRATION"", then in tiny light grey letters it says ""1st Layer 10 Micron Inner layer 5 Micron"".I am not too upset, they were only 10$."
5,worth spending,this is worth to buy online. your local water store cannot offer these at this price. excellent buy. five stars. I would buy again when I run out of those.
4,Good Buy.,Fair price and correct fit for my application. Filters work well clearing sediment and debris. 4 pack is very convenient.
1,Amazon might send you some other brand,"I buy these filters from Amazon. Sometimes they send me the Purenex item. Sometimes they sent me the FLOW-PRO brand. And then at other times they choose to actually send me the iSpring item. Most of them are lighter than the Culligan brand and seem to break apart easier at times, with the exception of the FLOW-PRO item, also sold under the ''iSpring'' and ''Purenex'' listings on Amazon, which seems to be the best quality.In summary, if Amazon can commit to selling the FLOW-PRO item to you, whether marketed either as ''iSpring'' or ''Purenex'', then I would recommend purchasing that FLOW-PRO item for sure!"
4,Good fit,"Taking a look at the options, this was the least expensive filter. Replacement was easy and the fit was perfect. 4 months later and I have noticed that it has turned brown from what was removed from the water and water pressure seems a bit lower. It seems like regular replacement is required but this is probably the case with most filters of this type.I may purchase these again next time although I am tempted to try another brand for comparison."
2,Smoke and mirrors,"This product arrived ahead of schedule, was packaged professionally and was a ""great price"" but unfortunately it stops there. This product is advertised as a high yield unit and has run dry after 500+ pages (little more than a ream of paper) of printing (text only). I believe the old adage goes, ""you get what you pay for""? I might have gotten more out of an ink jet unit. Don't waist your time."
4,Very Good...Remember it was in a foreign language!,"Truth is, it's a book written in a language where all the English sounds very militant. It was really only militant in thought, and there is a lot of inductive rhetoric. Understood it is one of the first books about the abstention from vices by using virtues, and was originally a thesis for the basis of the monastic orders of the church in the Middle East. It is however a great book, and it will teach you what the vices and virtues are even with some parables."
1,Simple does not equal simplistic,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. It uses fancy, sophisticated-sounding but still meaningless lingo to describe commonsense everyday issues. Why complicate something what can be described in simple terms? The author fails to understand that simple does not equal simplistic."
1,Limited real life applicability of SCRIPT methodology,"I am in total agreement with the opinion of the reader from Chicago, who rated this book 1 star based on its tendency of overcomplicating straightforward issues in everyday decision making. In addition to this observation, I found that the SCRIPT methodology, the main idea of this book, is only appliacabe to a limited number of decisions and not to ALL as the authors suggest."
2,Fuzzy....fuzzy,"i found this book quite fuzzy, although there are excellent books about decision making out there."
1,Save your money,"This Hanlong Tool from Taiwan was a complete waste of money. Contrary to the package information, the blades were NOT preset and would not cut RG-6 properly. The braid was a ragged mess and had to be trimmed manually to avoid long whiskers and shorts to the center conductor. Even adjustment to the proper cutting depth did not stop the wadding up of the braid and the resulting extra work before the connector could be attached. Regular wire strippers or a sharp knife do a better job. Save your time and money and do not buy this product."
2,Too labor intensive,"The book isn't what I had in mind. It was originally published in 1961, and almost all the recipes are from scratch, and I didn't even find a recipe for stuffed cabbage rolls.I don't usually buy books online that I haven't seen in person elsewhere. So the fault is with me, not the book."
4,lego star wars galaxy fight-imperial landing craft,"I think the toy is fairly magnificent. I had much fun building it. It comes with likable features, like an enormous troop compartment, movable wings, a firing missile, a pilot's ""control center"",bombs, and 5 Imperial cronies- 1 pilot and 4 stormtroopers(actually two are sandtroopers). The only problem is that it is so gigantic and awkward that it is somewhat hard to carry.I believe this toy is very educational. It will make you have excellent mental durability, as well as the ability to arrange and create.The overall sturdiness of the piece was good. Except for some minor annoyances(especially in the troop compartment), the piece was fairly durable.My ideology is that this toy is always worth a try. Even though its expensive(49.99!), you should buy it."
5,impieral craft,"the imperial landing craft is very good, the folding wings are pretty hard to assemble. Other than that its a 1 class toy( 5 star!)"
5,lego's are great,"My son loves the older lego sets and they are hard to find,had no problemlocating this one on Amazon.com . It was just the one he wanted for his birthday,he loved it.Lego's are great mind teasers,It's great to watch him build something out of all those pieces.what a great toy."
3,"Difficult, inappropriate for a precocious 6 year old.",I have a six year-old boy who has managed to conquer all of the other lego sets without too much trouble. He hit a wall with this one - specifically the moving gears in the back that move the tail surfaces up and down. We boxed it and set it aside for next year.
1,this Lego set stinks,"This Lego Star Wars set is the worst set I have built. It broke 5 days after I built it. The bottom compartment would not fit on after 2 days, and it split into 3 pieces 3 days after I built it. A flat piece snapped in half, and I finally took the ship apart to use the pieces for other ships.The whole experience really disappointed me for the price I paid. Connor."
3,Awaiting a refund,"I purchased two of these toys, one day apart. I was told there would be a refund which is still forthcoming. You did charge my account for the purchases, immediately. Why does a refund take so long when electronically, it's a few key strokes?"
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Overlong, poorly-acted (accomplished British thespians O'Toole and Rampling excluded) with terrible dubbing of the Italian actors and a low-budget feel, Augustus is not worth watching when the HBO series Rome does so much better with similar material: stay away."
2,Wretched,"I couldn't finish this. It was full of cliche, clumsy exposition and had no real sense of humor. Steer clear of this one."
3,Not bad,"Peter O'Toole is classic as Emperor Augustus Caesar, retelling the tale of his sudden ascendance to the throne and continuing the dream of his uncle Julius in creating a great and civilized Rome. The script was a bit weak at points and some of the acting by the characters seemed forced, but the overall story line is worthy. In the end you sympathize with personal sacrifices as well as the sacrifices of his family Augustus makes to ensure a true and grand Rome could persevere."
2,"Great Neptune, what a mess!","A gratuitous and unclarifying flashback-within-a-flashback chronological scheme. Highly uneven acting, to the point where you wonder whether the director wasn't drunk during most of the shooting. Post-prod dubbing which renders the voices excruciatingly phony. Some pretty faces and some good actors with little to do (extra points to Charlotte Rampling, who comes out unscathed). Compares unfavorably toRome - The Complete First Seasonand of course, sorry to bring it up, but the unsurpassedI, Claudius."
5,"Excellent Muscianship,and Very tight harmonies","I really Wasnt sure if I would like this recording,but after listning to the first four cuts I was hooked.The harmonies of the Crowe Brothers are as good as anyone I have come across.I would rank them right with the Everlys,Stanley brothers and the other brother acts. And the instrumentation is top notch, especially Zane Fairchilds guitar playing,keep a eye on this future,(guitar god)a very great c.d"
1,THE WONG GUY,"WOW...This is one of the worst movies made..and I don't often go that low..but this martial arts movie is so bad, it's hilarious!Writer/producer/actor Leo Wong moves through the movie like a somnambulent ghost, and the action scenes are staged so ridiculously, you wonder how he got anyone to finance this one! Also, Akosua Busia (Color Purple, Mad City) as the cult's Karma gives one of the most hilarious speeches ever trapped on celluloid. At the cult farm, she gives the leader's message, and she is so overwrought and dramatic, it is absolutely sidesplitting. Add Cameron Mitchell as the hooded guru, Troy Donahue as a college student's rich father, and you have the makings for the coup de gras of action films.This one is so bad, you want to sterilize your VCR.Please, unless you really want to laugh a lot, avoid this one!"
5,the best movie ever,This is the best movie I have seen. I no longer own a video and wonder why I cant see this title under DVD!!!
5,French for Beginners,"I agree with Galena: this movie was excellent. I saw it when it was first released in America and fell in love with it, too. It was based on a theater piece that I would dearly love to see, and, since there's no dialogue, I wonder (as I did then) if there could possibly be an American version in there somewhere. I really want the DVD (I've got an all-region player, so PAL isn't a problem), but $50.00? Gee, maybe if I had a job, I'd consider buying it....."
5,A Treat,"I heard a piece from this recording on my Public Radio Station and just had to have it. Of course the CD quality is even better. The clarity of Touvron playing, his technique in other words, and the interpretations are a revelation to me."
3,Fence angles on odd shaped lots will be a problem.,From the online reviews I decided to purchase Landscaping and Deck Designer ver. 7.01. I have to warn you that if you have an odd shaped lot you'll run into a problem with the software. If you have to make fence angles that aren't at 90 degrees perpendicular to each other you may not be able to draw a fence that is exactly shaped like yours. I have an odd shaped lot and when I tried to make the fence angles the same as mine the drawn fences only rotate in 7 1/2 degree increments. This means you either have to make a lot size bigger or smaller than what your actual lot size is. The work around is to draw a lot size bigger than yours then manually draw your actual fence lines. I confirmed with their tech support that the software works that way.
3,Pros & Cons of BHG Landscape & Deck Designer,"All in all This program appears to be the best of what is available for landscaping and deck design. I found it easy to learn and implement except for some roof and elevation problems (which were unable to be resolved adequately). For Californians and many western region locales without gable or hip roofs it can be difficult to design your exact building, but this is the landscape and deck portion and not the entire building program. It does allow you to quickly design most landscape and deck designs possible and the 3D is drawn quickly and the detail is excellent. Trees and plants for many California locales are lacking, but it is possible to use a variety of trees/plants that will give you a good idea of what you are after. I found minor imperfections that were difficult to overcome in elevations but compared to what is available without learning a CAD program this is a bargain for the money paid."
1,Not good for a novice,"I have moderate knowledge of computers, etc. and I found this overly complicated. This is not intended for the novice. However, even if you are not a novice it seems to still be a waste of money. I wish I had not bought it at all. Perhaps it has secrets and treasures I am not aware of...but the directions are complicated and it would be by chance that you would ever discover them. Save your money...this was a waste."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"Do not waste your money! I consider myself pretty computer savvy, but this software is not easy to use. You'd have an easier time just drawing out your ideas by hand."
5,Awesome!,"I purchased this to give to my mom for Mother's Day last year. She's in the process of trying to figure out what to do with her backyard and I figured this would be an ideal tool for her to use in order to get a preview of her backyard. She's fiddled around with it some, but has yet to upload photos of her backyard and really start messing around with it, but I suspect she'll get into it in due time."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this based on the reviews on Amazon but I'm not too pleased with it. Too many things you can't do (make garden paths, show a curved lot). And the things you can do often seem useless like fancy backdrops such as mountains or the ocean.I also thought there would be a lot of templates and things you could just drop into your plan. No - just a couple of flower beds and they aren't flexible in how they can be done.The ""Landscape Design Center"" is just a bunch of text - tips and the like and they're not even very good tips. (And if I wanted to just READ I would have bought a book, not a computer program.)I spent a lot of time working on this but it's just not very good."
3,"Low budget, not enough plant species","An adequate low budget tool.Very few plants that grow in South Florida are in the database and I spent more time whiting out photos from my local nursury and neighbors in Paint to import than designing my landscape. Add-in plant files are expensive. Anything that grows in my yard was only included as little houseplants, which is great if you live in New England and grow your crotons and hibiscus in indoor containers.Not friendly to architecute outside the temperate zones."
1,A total disappointment,"I expected better form BHG. This software is for people who want to play around with a 3D image of their house and deck, fooling around with different styles of chairs, grills and lights. It is not for the serious gardener. The navigation is cumbersome, the plant selection is limited, drawing capabilities are meager. The only good thing about it was that when I called the company for a ""return number"", the customer service person I spoke with was very polite and asked for suggestions for improving future versions of the software."
2,Barely tolerable with poor manual,"This program takes way too much trial and error to figure out how it works. The aerial or helicopter view is very nice. The walk around view doesn't work as far as I can tell. Creating the drawing is too tedious for my taste, requiring me to constantly switch from one window to another. And lots of scrolling through big libraries of objects. I don't know of a better program for amateures, but don't expect this one to be easy to use."
3,Not what I was hoping for,"From the on-line reviews, I decided to purchase this. It is very difficult to use and not as helpful as I was hoping. I live in a very arid climate and prefer to use xeric landscaping. The landscape options were limited for this type of habitat.ALso the plant palatte was pretty ho-hum. Basically, I could have gone to my local home-depot and found the same plant pallette.THe training video went really fast and if you aren't 100% focused, you'll miss alot. I had to try things over and over before I finally figured certain things out.Basically, I could have done the same thing with a piece of paper and a pencil, but it is still fun to play around with.I would recommend this to a professional who needs to show clients visuals, but for your average do-it-yourselfer, it is just too time consuming. I would rather be out playing in the dirt!"
2,only works on standard,"unable to complete 1st 3 projects because prog doesn't like short walls (playhouse), stairs get confused on cantilevered deck, and it's near impossible to put columns in a curved brick wall (even that doesn't allow change in height). For my purposes, a waste of money."
2,Landscaping and Deck Designer,"This product is marginal at best. Keeps crashing system. Display is crude and inconsistent. Impossible to use as a deck designing tool. Plant encyclopedia is a joke. It's a fun toy, but not more than that."
1,Better Homes and Gardens Landscaping and Deck Designer,I agree with Josh. I've never been so frustrated in my life! What a waste of time and money. I tried it over and over thinking maybe I needed just a little more patience. I'm not sure an engineer with CAD experience could run this program let alone a novice. Don't waste your time.
1,terrible,This is the most frustrating program ever. if you want to do land scape design. Your better off with a pad of paper and a pencil. It will take you less time and frustration than this thing will.
3,schecter stiletto fretless five,"I bought this bass because I own a four string fretted and I love it, I had to tweak this bass because the one I purchased the pickups were wired in reverse so I removed them and replaced with bartolini and I love it but if I wasn't into repairs I would have sent it back didn't sound as good as the four string one I have that's identical.It sounds great now"
4,Buzz Bin Music,"This CD has some really good music on it. I liked this one, and Buzz Bin 1. If you have a chance, you should pick up both. You won't be disappointed."
2,Every MTV- Made One Hit Wonder of the 90's!,"The majority of the artists on this album are one hitters: Nada Surf, the Cardigans, Primative Radio Gods, the Flaming Lips, etc. If that's your cup of tea, then buy it, otherwise save your money."
4,"Good Films, Good Book","I love archival books like the ""From Star Wars to Indiana Jones: The Best of the Lucasfilm Archives"" and this is one of my favourites, it's got tons of images from all the Star Wars and Indy movies. The text is somewhat unsubstantial, however the layout and design make up for any flaws. All this and quality you can expect from the best ""Making Of"" guy in the buisness, Mark Cotta Vaz. This makes for perfect coffee table reading for any film buff and a great price too. A great addition to any film fan's bookshelf."
3,Beyonce Bash,"It was okay, if you are a Beyonce fan, then you will love it.... but it's alot of little stuff"
3,Not for Deneuve admirers,"Deneuve is in a subdued role in this film. She's also in a supporting role so the film cover is a bit misleading. The story is not as strong as others that she's chosen.Daniel Auteuil is great as the cop who is entangled in the life of a trouble-making young woman. Extremely sexy in this role, he plays the role of a strong yet conflicted law enforcer well.The film is a bit weak in its flow. It's not the worst film but it's also not extremely good either."
2,Just ok,"This seems to be a typical French movie: not very much substance, but lots of seeming complexity and sexual deviation treated pretentiously. Lesbianism, transvestitism, suicide, talk of loneliness and fate, philosophy, a policeman who lets off a murderer for no explained reason: you got it all here. Don't the French have normal people? The jumps in time through flashbacks and the many closeups of actors contribute to the effect of trying to look more profound that the movie is. The high point of the movie is the Arab-sounding song played when Nabile drives the car."
3,Wandering Pelican,"The author roves over many examples of solitary life, touching all too briefly on variants from the isolated spiritual hermit to the modern eccentric recluse. There is little evidence of in depth study of the life, rather a broadsheet offering glimpses on anyone who seems to have sought to live apart, for whatever reason.If you are searching for a better understanding of what the solitary or silent life is, look elsewhere."
4,Solace for the Soul,"This is a well written exploration of the solitary life. Isabel Colegate uses her novelist's skills to imagine what might lead people to retreat into solitude. Religious ideals, political exile and romantic heartbreak are just few of the reasons she finds in her ambitious biography of famous hermits and hermitages. Despite the sad endings of more than quite a few hermits, the author demonstrates the joy that being alone can bring.Reading this work makes me ask, ""Where's my grotto?"""
4,Fayn Ayamak,"There are four songs on this CD (Fayn Ayamak, Hubbak Qadar, Ya Liyl and one I can't remember the name of). The first three mentioned are very good. Fayn Ayamak and Hubbak Qadar are both sad but great for dancing, and Warda's vocals are beautiful as usual. The third song, the one I can't remember the name of, I do not like so much. It is too westernized for me. Ya Liyl is a live recording, so it's slightly fuzzy, but it doesn't get in the way of the effectiveness of the song. You can also hear clapping, whistling and zaghareet. But it's a great song.The CD is definitely worth the money."
5,Great socks for softball,This socks are great for softball. They look can and are strong enough to withstand the grind of the season. Fast shipping and a great price. i would recommend.
3,"good socks, a little thick for my taste","pretty good socks, they start to fray a bit after repeated washes. i probably won't buy any more since they are pretty thick. if you like that though they're good socks."
2,This slips off and sometimes hurts the ear.,"I practice Brazilian Jiu Jitsu regularly (3 times or more per week) and constantly go up against larger guys. Think 30lbs+ heavier. I was ready to love this headgear but it keeps slipping off and shifts around the longer you roll. Sometimes when my opponent puts pressure against the side of my face the ear guard puts unnecessary pressure against my ear. Or if the ear guard shifts, my ear is partially exposed and there is pressure on my exposed ear. This is unacceptable as it no longer has a function as an ear protector.I have modified the earguard making it super tight, snug, loose and nothing works to make the earguard fit well and not have issues above.Also, I purchased from Cannon Sports which takes too long to ship the product. After a week I contacted them to cancel my order and they just shipped it the next day. How very suspicious. I would not buy this product again and not buy from Cannon Sports again."
4,Decent headgear,I use these for BJJ and they work well at protecting my ears. They seem to slide around a bit when they're sweaty but my ears no longer get sore.
3,"Nice equiptment, comfort an issue",Really like this headgear and the top strap tends not to get pulled over your eyes but...The straps rub uncomfortably on skull during practice and I think my old style were more comfortable in that area. I really do like the ear protection and the more gradual form around that area makes it not as likely to be caught by an arm or hand in competition.
5,Nice fit!,"Thank goodness for new headgear design!!! MUCH better coverage for the ears, easy to adjust....mys on is THRILLED with them! Much more comfortable and he can hear his coach!"
5,Good medium priced headgear,"After getting it finally adjusted, worked just fine. We bought through amazon for the color selection. It's in all the wrestling catalogs."
4,A worthwhile investment,"I purchased these for my Honda V 65 Magna. I have a 7"" round light modification done previously. These headlamps are a little larger than 7"" and I had to cut my trim ring to install.The lighting power is a big improvement over the stock lighting. Over time, the reflectors develop crack and fade thus, reduce the light beams focus. These are very good lights. I was at a convienence store with a riding friend. We pulled up to the store and the reflection of my headlamp compared to his was far better.I'm sold on Hella products, there is good value and the lighting makes me feel safer."
5,Incredible improvement,"These lights are just as described, if not better. The installation was very easy and they fit perfect. I had to cut out the center of the dust boot for the plug to fit properly, a simple modification. Amazing improvement over the stock headlights."
3,Cow-Punk comparable - Jason & Scorchers w/ sense of humour,"I grew up with Dash Rip Rock in Louisiana. I would buy the record just to say thank you for countless great parties, but this is a quality release. I bought it partially because it has a copy of Marsupial, which was one of the first songs that ever received airplay in south LA. As with most bands, the early material usually has more legs as is the case with this release"
2,This book needs a diet!,"Overly wordy, repetitive and lacking in supportive evidence (except that it works for him). I skipped most of the text looking for the ""meat"" of the book. Whoever edited this missed numerous typographical errors and nobody tested the recipes. I found errors and omissions without even stepping foot in the kitchen. Also the recipes aren't exactly enticing. Just thought I'd mention that.It may be a good idea. But it's hard to get past what is lacking in this book (writing ability, for example) to see if it's worth a try."
5,The truth will set you free...,Everytime someone finds the Word of God more enlightening than a man-made doctrine.....Catholics denounce them as negative and hateful. This book shows how enlightening and freeing the Word of God and the truth can and will be. This book was very open and honest. All open-minded people should read it.....if you're a close minded Catholic....don't bother.
5,An intriguing glimpse into the Roman Church,In this book you have the personal written testimony of a number of men who found error within the Church of Rome and decided to leave. This book is an easy read and you will find yourself quickly flipping through the pages to read the accounts of these men whom were earnestly religious upon entering the priesthood but found something to be lacking.It should come as no surprise that these men typically during their own study find issue with Catholic doctrine not lining up with Scripture and that typically gets the ball moving.Read it all in one sitting or break it up as these are all rather short stories. I think many people will find this interesting to see the personal thoughts of those in ministry who struggle and wrestle with the texts.I found it to be a good book and will be going back to it for further reflection
2,"Okay as a reference book, Not worth the money","As a recent convert to Catholicism from the Baptist faith, I found this book shallow at best. Written to catch they eye of those who don't study theology and differences between the faiths in depth, this text has priests sharing how they ""found Jesus"" in the Bible and became Christians and left the Church. What it doesn't tell you is the backround on so many of these priests. Such as Brewer (chapter 3) who decided he wanted to leave the Church when he no longer wanted to remain celibate and desired to get married. If you want a book from Protestants that makes a decent attempt to address the issues read ""The Gospel According to Rome"" by McCarthy. I suggest being balanced though and reading ""The Gospel according to James McCarthy"" (Grotto Press) as well."
1,Priests forever,"I'm sure the contributors to this book would disagree, but, the fact of the matter is, each and every one of them will remain priests forever. The sacrament of Holy Orders puts a supernatural character on a man's soul, so he will remain a priest forever, even if he apostatizes. With that in mind, I would challenge those contributors to this sad volume who are still living to read A PRIEST FOREVER by Fr. Benedict J. Groeschel, the biography of Fr. Eugene Hamilton -- a young man who died three hours after his ordination to the priesthood by special papal dispensation. These men rejected through ignorance, at best, or sin, at worst, a calling Fr. Hamilton so courageously sought to share in. Read A PRIEST FOREVER, gentlemen, *then* try to convince me that to be ""far from Rome"" means to be ""near to God."""
1,Don't waste your money,This is kindergarten reasoning and theology. Just wish I'd have heeded the other reviewer's warnings that Google provided me.
3,What I was looking for,"This book contained the kind of testimonials I was looking for. I have had some questions about certain elements of the Catholic faith and the stories of these former priests certainly addressed those. My one criticism would be that many of the priests were from pre-Vatican II and from other countries...leaving the reader with questions about applicability to modern American ""Romanism""."
4,Unless One Is Born Again,"An excellent testimony and revelation of men (actually, ex-catholic priests) being regenerated by the Holy Spirit to see the Truth. And the Truth have set them free. Jesus said in John 3:3, ""Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."" And Paul in Ephesians 2:8-9 - ""For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast."" Only two things stands out from this book, believing in salvation by grace (only God converts) or believing in salvation by works (that man has the ability to convert themself). In the words of Jesus Christ, ""He who has ears to hear, let him hear!"""
4,The best song!,"I love this song because anyone who feels that life or just their life sucks, has to listen to this song. You'll listen and go ""been there, hated that"". Some parts you can totally relate to. So please pick up a pair headphones or whatever and learn why life's a bitch!"
4,Playmobil+Unicorn=Awesome!,"My daughter loves Playmobil and unicorns so a Playmobil Unicorn that's pink on top of that is the epitome of awesome for her! We love Playmobil for its durability. The mane is interchangeable with other Playmobil unicorns and the horn does not come off no matter how hard it's played with. This unicorn is played with inside, outside, and in the bath. I bought it originally to put on top of her cake for her unicorn-themed birthday and double as a gift. It became one of her favorite toys. She pairs it with another Playmobil unicorn the same size and one that's ""baby unicorn"" size. They became a family."
3,"Great ""lazy day"" reading","I stumbled upon this book while searching for something to bide my time on a flight and was pleasantly suprised. Though the central storyline of the novel was more or less predictable, it was the peripheral action that I enjoyed. The banter between Joe Dolan and his buddy Surfer led me back to my collegiate days and the unforgettable talks about absolutey nothing. The accounts of the action on the rugby pitch would make any participants of the gentleman's game nod their heads with a knowing grin. Obviously I am not a polished reviewer of popular fiction, but I feel that I represent a large number of readers that really enjoy hanging out in the backyard with a good book and a few beers. ""Caveman Politics"" is perfect for that very situation."
2,Trite and slow,"You would think that a little rugby action could tighten the pace of weak rape/race plot,but it didn't. Maybe because there was so little rugby involved. Deep South Rugby is an interesting thing but this author missed all the key points. Where were the songs, where was the terminology, the jokes, the differences between pack and backs. I doubt if Jay Atkinson has ever done more than watch on occasional match. This novel is best avoided."
3,Four good interwar examples of expanding state power,"Memorable. This review is for the first half and intro/concl. Four examples of the expanding cultural power of the state in Japan, primarily interwar with 19th century background. I found the case for state power in prostitution and cafe society an arresting topic. However, the section on cults contains good horror tales of gov. oppression, and the growth of Christian societies and welfare-type activity new to me."
5,Working great!,My camera had used it's last charge on the battery that came with it. This replacement battery seems to be holding a charge better than the original one ever did! I would recommend this battery to a friend.
3,No battery cap,"The battery arrived without a cap to protect the contacts. I don't feel comfortable carrying it without one, so an additional expense to buy one from Greenbatties. Apparently this is the norm for non-OEM batteries, but still a bit of a disappointment.I won't be able to use it until the cap arrives, so I can't really comment on the quality of the battery for now."
4,A good battery at a good price.,There isn't much to say. The blurb says it all.You will need a good knife to get it out of the plastic.
1,the bad lenmar DLOM1for olympus battery,"I got 2 of these on amazon , it is the Bad battery I have got , take first full charge 6 hours , put in olympus e 510 , took 25 photos and "" battery empty "" second charger the same hours and still took 25 photos.To compare with 2 battery I've got before , name CTA , more cheaper , and took 80 Raw photos still work ( just slower to restart ), one time , I forgot take it out pocket b4 and put in laundery with full cycle , when move clother into dryer I found it, take it out , leave a week to dry , after that still working as normal!this time because i want more aliable battery for my important job , Lenmar took me down .of cours it happen no more , just give review to help some one , do not choose this one , CTA for olympus more cheaper and work better"
4,Finally!,"After two failed purchases from Amazon sellers, I opted to get this battery from Amazon directly and I got it promptly.Thanks Amazon"
2,little information in this book,"I was very excited at the first eyedrop in this book.But having read half of it, I asked myself: what did I learn and is it worth to continue the reading.What I learned is the definition of the Fisher information matrix and the eventuality that the laws of physics are woven with the thread of information. But I stopped reading further.I had the bad feeling that the author greatly overstates his case.It was nearly clear for me that all applications of the supposed theory where built on a simple canvas:- rename the two terms of the Lagrangian as 'Fisher information' and 'physical information'- and rename further the least-action-principle as 'EPI' (Extreme Physical Information)Still, I think the subject is interresting and I may myself give it a second chance.Therefore it is a good buy only if you can accept some disappointement and if you hope to go further by yourself."
1,You may want to look at...,"R. F. Streater has a website listing ""Lost Causes in Theoretical Physics."" Physics from Fisher Information is number 7 on the list."
1,Nothing new,"The essence of really great theoretical physics is that it creates new insights and makes novel, experimentally verifiable predictions that take us in new directions, capabilities and understanding.And that is what is missing from Frieden's work, thoroughly reviewed here - it just re-derives well-established standard-physics results from a different angle, but doesn't lead into new pastures - or at least, not yet... So what?Must try harder; 'me too' is simply not good enough."
5,music worthy of a leviathan,"I heard this CD after i saw the movie, my fater was testing me, by putting on the Cd and played it, saying ""guess what this is from"". I finally figured it out, but what i heard what just glorious soundtrack music. This is the kind of powerful, awesome force of music that soundtracks collectors seek. The main theme is gorgeous, and it was played with previews of many other movies, such as war moveis and action ones in theaters.Ive a really big collection from various moveis, and this one of my top favorites. Great job from Rabin."
4,Informative!,"I've had this book for about a month or two and have learned much about my plants. I really like that it gives the heat zones (as well as the hardiness zones) for the plants. Living in the desert it is very helpful to see which plants can survive the summer heat. The back of the book has a list of all the genera as well as its species along with zones, light, sun, height, etc. for quick reference. The one thing I do not like, however, is that all the photos are listed in one section in the back of the book. This makes it a little annoying flipping back and forth to see the pictures."
3,ok,"it's a good book, but not being a gardener I was looking for a section that would guide me what to plant and when showing all the flower options for each season. Now I need to get another book that has all that, hence I rate the book 3*."
4,:0),I loveeeeeeeee this movie so much it never gets old a good watch if your that die hard romantic type.
5,Endearing & Entertaining,This movie was the first I've ever purchased from the Harlequin series and I loved it. The characters and very likeable and the story line is entertaining and romantic. I can't wait to see what other movies from the Harlequin series I can fall in the love with.
2,harlequin romance series - diamond girl,"The movie was entertaining but nothing spectacular. The girl playing the lead was good but the lead male didn't exactly fit my image of a harlequin hero though he wasn't bad as an actor. The movie was suppose to take place in California but was filmed in South Africa which was a poor double for California. if you can get past that, you'll be entertained. Its actually one of the better Harlequin movies I've seen."
3,Let's Face It Folks - Harlequin Romance DVD's Are Not High Art.,"The plot is ludicrious and the dialogue far from stellar, but that is not why one watches this sort of thing, is it?Naturally, beneath her dowdy clothes, glasses and hair in a bun, the young assistant is revealed to be a startling beauty with a figure and face to die for. While the male lead, one of the most impossibly handsome men alive, is naturally (she says with deep sarcasm) too timid to simply ask her out and instead engages in a series of silly machinations to be in her company.All in all a nice distraction for an hour or so, but one who wants to see superb romance onscreen might want to rent Casablanca."
4,The other side of ....Norway,"Paal Sletaunes film was nominated for Oscar in the cathegory of best foreign film. I, among several other Norwegians, thought it better that the movie didn't win: imagine what it would do to our tourism! Norway turns out to be more than the midnight sun, fjords and folklore.The protagonist Roy is everything your mother tought you not to be: he is a laidback, filthy, irresponsible and intruding young man. Not the man you want to deliver your mail! His environment is a side of Oslo that I never have seen, and sincerly hope that I never will be exposed to!The humor is as black as it gets! If you like Lock Stock and Snatch, you might like this very much! You will not find as much violence though!The film to pic if you're bored with the slick, politically correct hollywood crap!I was searching for the DVD...wanting to watch the fim again!"
1,Way below average game,"Serious Sam next encounter must rate as one of the worst first person shooters to appear in recent times. Croteam created quite a reputation with the release of serious Sam 1 and 2, although they seem to have lost their way with serious Sam next encounter. Next encounter simply does not match up to the standards set by the other two games. Maybe it is down to the fact that the whole concept is simply too out of date to match up to the standards set by the other first person shooters out there at the present time."
3,Okay if your type of Game is just killing.,"The game is quite fun for a some while but just gets old. The game's graphics are smooth and great, that's the good part but is just too basic, the ragdoll's (scenes of there defeat, blowing up, flying off, etc.) happens all the time, the zombies blow up and the dinos will fly off in front of you. The story, still can't figure it out. Controls are easy, wouldn't mind if had a sequel on the GameCube. Replay, up to you."
1,Not so great FPS,One word to sum up Serious Sam: Next Encounter and that is AWFUL!If there were to 2 words then the second word would be AVOID!
5,Heads Are Gonna Roll!,"An Awesome CD, The HIPpos are a great ska-punk band, and if you're into more of a pop sound you'll love this cd. I've read tons of complaints about the over sythasizing of this album, but i don't really have a problem with it at all. My favorite songs are Better Watch Your Back, Wasting My Life, Thinking, Something, and Always Something There To Remind Me. If you're not into the whole synthasizing thing try out their first release ""Forget The World""."
5,lust take a listen,"I dare anyone out there, if they have heard ska or not, if they like it or not, to listen to the fist two tracks of this CD and not like it. And thats just the start of a CD filled with great songs, silly and fun lyrics, and just wondeful sounds...take a try!! Its totally worth it."
2,"Bad band, bad CD","Lol. One of my favorite quotes by Jesse Swann (See above review): ""These words mostly sound like they're from the secret diary of a 12-year old boy who is starting to 'feel funny'about girls and wants to relay all the fun little games and inner feelings he has for that certain girl of his dreams to somebody."" I certainly agree with this. This band sucks. It is borderline, crappy ska that no one should purchase. However, it is borderline ska, so I have to give it two stars. One star is reserved for Green Day and rap. If you want to listen to ska, check out Ska Masta Skibz's lists. Those will help you get an idea of what good music is."
2,Dissapointing,"Alright, the reason I didn't give it one star was because I have to much respect for their first album. The synthesizers make it sound horrible. That could be the reason no other ska bands use synthesizers. Wait...maybe thats the reason NO bands use sythesizers but techno bands. Anyways I heard a lot of hype about the Hippos for this album but I should have known that was cause the preppies were saying it. I think the hippos are one of those bands that people want to be good. This is my opinion so dont get all mad at me. Check out their first album, though, cause it's really good."
2,Lame 80s flock of seagulls garbage,"i absolutely loved their first CD, even if the topics were fairly juvenile (high school kid in love, getting a speeding ticket, etc.). i got this one and much of the ska sound from their first CD was replaced by cheesy 80s synthesizers. Is this the same group? Lord, it's awful. And who remakes Always Something There To Remind You? Yuch."
5,great cd.....dont listen to any reviews under 4 stars,"this is a great, solid cd, all the way through....i hate it when you buy a cd and there is only one or two good songs...not with this cd....every song is great, it will keep you interested the whole way through. And you WONT get tired of it after a month, that guy doesnt know what hes talking about. trust me. yeah, maybe they arent as hardcore ska as they used to be, but that doesnt mean they suck...that means that other people that like all kinds of music should like this cd because it is great. if you are smart, or have any taste of music, you will buy this cd. its genious. cant wait to hear more of them."
5,Outstanding,"Heads Are Gonna Roll is one of the best CD's I've bought this year. I highly recommend it, not only that but everyone should catch these guys live. They ROCK even more. Catch them with Goldfinger on tour this October and soon after with The Aquabats later this Fall."
5,A Frigin good cd BiEtCh!,"This cd is extremely good, one of the only ska bands who has a synth and just sounds good but also different than all the other ska bands"
4,Running Wild again!!!,Masters have arrived again with a good material. This CD has no bad track at all. Missing one star just because all bonus tracks are not as much good as original tracks. Overall interesting material that will satisfy your expectation into Power Metal on high seas.
3,a return to form?,"with this particular cd it seem as though running wild has made an effort to regain some of their earlier style and sound. be warned it is not as rabid as their first two releases ,not too bad at all."
3,"Good features, young product","Once it is configured, it runs well. However, I had the config lock a few times, and I tried with both IE and Mozilla. I e-mailed support and got no response. When running, it has a good feature set (you can turn off SSID broadcasts, control access via MAC addresses, multi-key WEP, port filtering, and much more). I wish they used the same antenna connector they use on the normal Gold cards. I think after a firmware update, and with an external antenna, I'd be _really_ happy."
4,Eloise takes on the Cold War,"While ""Eloise"" and ""Eloise in Paris"" are funny and charming enough for adults and children alike, Eloise's visit to Moscow might be a bit puzzling to young children. It is a little darker than the other two, and very much a product of the Cold War (perhaps even a commentary on it). This is perhaps the most existential of the Eloise books."
3,Careful what you teach your children,"Eloise books due to their 1950's context construct notions of gender roles through the use of gendered tourist encounters. For example, the Russian women are constructed as exemplifing a notion of communism in their constant sweeping of snow when it snows all the time - what is the point/goal of the work. Is the cold war context that which we want children to understand the world? Eloise participates in this process too."
4,Historical fun!,"Children will love the comical adventures of everyone's favorite six-year-old in Soviet Moscow.Adults will appreciate the look into American-Soviet relations forty years ago, and Hilary Knight's wonderful drawings of it.Why not five stars? Maybe by this fourth Eloise book, the whimsy is a little predictable by now."
2,where's the bonus tracks?,"Spv usually does an excellent job in reissuing cds. the packaging is usually top notch and they include bonus material. for live in london, the cover art has changed, and not to the better, and there is no bonus tracks. get the repertoire version with original cover art and 2 bonus tracks for 20 minutes of extra material. sound quality is not that different."
4,Amon Duul II - 'Live In London' (Mystic),"Concert took place in late 1972, but the record wasn't released until 1974. 'Live In London' shows the curious modern day fans (like myself) just how Amon Duul II was able to nearly master their sound as well as vibe on a concert stage. This is a very strong performance, I thought.Tunes here are mostly from the 'Yeti' and 'Tanz Der Lemmings' albums. Cuts I was more than impressed with were the grand krautrock gem of an opener ""Archangel Thunderbird"", ""Eye Shaking King"" and ""March of The Seventies"". The two bonus tracks tagged on are good too, the 17-minute ""Bavarian Soap Shop Rock"" and ""Improvisation On Gulp A Sonata"" appear to be remixes of lp cuts. No matter,'Live In London' is still a keeper. A should-have."
4,blow your mind,"Black Sabbath meets the Velvet Underground at a Jefferson Airplane concert. loud distorted guitars and pounding percussion mixed in with the male/female vox and some noisy improv thrown in. the band kicks off the live show with the truly arse-kicking ""Archangels Thunderbird"" from the ""Yeti"" album; which the majority of this setlist is taken from. the set list also contains 3 pieces from ""Tanz der Lemminge."""
3,Signature Housewares Now & Then 8-Ounce Glasses,"These glasses are cute and a nice size, say, for margaritas or even just iced tea. However, they are VERY fragile. Can I complain too much given the price? Not really, but just be careful because they are very thin and easy to shatter."
3,good value for the money,"cheap enough...not sure exactly what you would use these for, not great for wine, too small for water..."
5,A superb soundtrack that rivals The Crow,"This soundtrack is one of the best I've listened to in a long time. I happened upon it because it needed to be programmed for the radio station and I didn't have much to do that night. Right away I knew that it was going to be good; the first song really hooks you, and I don't even like rap that much! The songs by Pure and Guster are in my opinion the best because they lend the soundtrack a heavy-but-not-grim feel. Guster has an album out called Goldfly, and if you like the song on this album, you will LOVE the album. Every song on Hurricane Streets is good on its own; seriously, not a bad one in the bunch."
5,A Brave Book,I quickly read this book from cover-to-cover. As the Southern Baptist Convention has shifted towards Fundamentalism. I was somewhat surprised and very thankful to see such a well written example of someone publicly taking a stand against the powerful leaders of the SBC.Part of Humphrey's success with this book is his respectful attitude toward the present and the past SBC leadership. I believe his respect for the current Fundamentlist leadership best represents a succesful Christ like discussion.This book should be on the reading-list for all Southern Baptists. If I had the resources I would personally buy as many copies of this book as I could to give to Baptist churches.
3,decent debut for best live band ever,"here's dash rip rock's debut. if you've seen them live, you might be disappointed in some of the song recordings. about half of the songs on this cd are still in their playlist, albeit in faster looser versions. they've also re-recorded several of these songs on gold record and the live boild alive, again in better versions. their sound here is not as punkish as it is REM-ish. that said, its the only place to get the great tunes pack your bags, old bridge & just for spite. being dash mach 1, you have to contend with fred ""cowboy mouth"" leblanc fouling up the air with a couple duds and lead on a cover of hank williams i saw the light (better version on gold record sung by best drummer ever seen, kyle melancon). this cd is definitely worth owning, but their are better first purchases."
5,Comprehensive Explanation of Living Your Life Gluten-Free,"Gluten-Free for a Healthy Life is a comprehensive book that explains the gluten-free lifestlye in terms that are both easy to read and understand. The author uses ""experts"" (people already living the gluten-free lifestyle) to give tips, tricks, recipes and advice. It is a useful and informative book for both the newly diagnosed with Celiac Disease as well as seasoned veterans. It's compact size makes it convenient to carry in a handbag when you go shopping.I highly recommend this book!"
5,Awesome book about Awesome women,"I just finished reading SIGHTS by Susanna Vance before I read this. Together, these are my favorite books. Both authors show girls at their strong best. I'm inspired!"
1,stinks,not even alittle bit close to Danzig. You can not even compare.This has to be the worse cd ever. There isn't one good thing to say about it......
5,FANTASTIC!!!! A must have!,"I was so excited to find this cd! I love it so much! I first heard Anthony Warlow's stunning vocals on my concept album of Jekyll and Hyde. This cd would be worth the cost if it only included one of the many songs it delivers. He perfectly performs Broadway classics like Music of the Night and Bring Him Home. I own over 100 cds of Broadway musical soundtracks and Broadway vocalists and this is top 10! Also among my favorites are Linda Eder's ""Broadway: My Way"", Stephanie J Block's ""This Place I Know"" and ""An Evening With Sutton Foster"". Warlow delivers one phenomenal performance after another! A true musical treasure. Buy it NOW!"
3,"Not bad, but not the best","To start off, a lot of the recordings are taken from vinyl. The records used are in titp (OOPS!) tip-top shape so the sound is great. There was no need to make a double CD of this collection because Carrie Lucas didn't have the best albums as a SOLAR artist (but is fine as hell,) in my opinion. I'm more of a Lakeside, Whispers or Midnight Star fan myself, but in all respect, Carrie did work with those artists and did have some cool joints. Some of which is included here, I think there could be a better ""best of"" compilation put together. I wish I could recommend buying a different product, but no one has hit the mark of a ""best of"" with recordings from the studio master tapes. If you can find it, Capital has a ""best of"" out of print, but is some of the best from the master tapes."
4,Not bad for a budget card.,"I put this in a budget system that will be for burning DVD`s and CD`s. I played the FPS game, Freedom Fighters, and had no problems with the game. I will probably buy another soon, to go in another system I`m building"
4,Works BUT,"It works well IF YOU HAVE THE CORRECT POWER SUPPLY! It needs at lease 300 watts or higher to work at all! It did not say that with the tech report! So just to let you know, check you power supply first!"
2,Pretty bad...,"Well first things first. I love Blair Witch copycats and thats exactly what this movie is, sorta. The problem is that only half the movie is shot with the handheld ""found footage"" and inbetween scenes they will have a parts where its shot with a real movie camera and is nolonger the point of view of the filmer. This makes the movie a bit disorienting and also breaks the realisim that those documentary horror movies have going for them... Not to mention the footage quality is horrible and at least there is an excuse for that when you're seeing it from the camera man's point of view. I would say this movie is a cross between The Blair Witch Project and Evil Dead... But nowhere as near entertaining as either of those titles. Worth a rent."
5,Very nice analysis with some new twists,This is a well thought out book. I picked it up cheap for a few of the included charts and graphs and was very nicely surprised by the content.The Friedmans have done a very nice survey of the evolutiionary ptrocess of weapons and weapons systems. The introduction of the concept of weapon senility vs weapon obselescence is very intersting.This one really makes you think.
3,A vision too far,"For a book which purports to see accurately into the future, the Friedmans seem to have been unable to completely grab onto the past. Most unpardonable are technical inaccuracies (like World War II torpedos that go 100 miles per hour) for the premise so often repeated seems to be that technology has begun to feed upon itself, i.e., become ""senile"". Even if that's so, their wholesale indictment of entire proven weapon systems (like Aegis or even gun projectiles, for that matter) ignores both the incremental nature of such developments as well as fiscal constraints that channel them (e.g., ""Star Wars""). While reading about exoskeletons and plasma weapons is entertaining, shooting wars even 10 years from now may not employ much if any of this speculative technology. That being the case, the Friedmans may have tried, then, to go a vision too far."
1,Opinions not facts!,This book is full of opinions and wishful thinking. Friedman doesn't know how to put facts straight. This book is a great lie.
3,The Future is Now?,"This book is about the coming American epoch. This author predicts that the face of war in the 21st Century will be dominated by the United States. His Prediction? The 21st Century is the American Century.The author presents a very complelling and optimistic survey. In one sense it is a traditional approach. Warfare will still be waged in accordance with rules and principles, but, the focus of this book is on technology and how that technology will shape the future of warfare."
3,"Interesting, however...","This book sums up the potential of American power in the next century, such as America's current technological leadership and the headstart we already have in many fields. It makes some interesting points about the computer and it's importance in military. However, it does not take into account the coming internal stresses that America will feel. (Mainly income inequality, and possible transformation into a third-world nation) The book ignores the power of economics in the world, relying on old fasioned military might to get the job done. Because of this, I believe that the book is dead wrong about the future of America."
4,Chicago Live 1979,"As is often the case with later Muddy live recordings there is a fair amount of 'padding' where Muddy isn't actually singing. Also there are a number of staples of his live set here of which there are better versions available. That said, the sound is good, the band are absolutely cookin' (as always) and the take of They Call Me Muddy Waters is worth the price of admission on its own. There's a wonderful laid back version of Kansas City too with Pinetop Perkins sharing the vocals. Recommended."
5,"A little boy's life, death, and remembrance","Superbly enhanced with photography by Simeon Hutner, Life With Sam is the free-verse poetic celebration by Elizabeth Hall Hutner of a little boy's life, death, and remembrance. This blending of heartfulet verses and memorable photographs embrace the life and joy one so young brought to the life of his mother, during his all too brief brief stay with her. Today, I Went Right To His Grave. / I Put Down The Flowers, And Looked / At The Boxwoods Sam's Stepfather / Has Planted On Each Side Of The Stone. / I Held The New Baby In My Arms, / And I Cried As I Read Sam's Name."
3,Back cover review,"The conjuring forth of diabolic and hellish forces is as old as time itself. Black magic and devil worship - with their ancient blood rituals - have literally killed millions of innocent victims. But despite the atrocities of the past, the present is far more frightening, the future terrible to behold. The powers of darkness have returned... the ultimate evil is back on earth."
3,Works as advertised,Works as advertised; a bit clunky to use and guide; not a lot of viability to what you are drilling; I guess that is to be expected when drilling down a hole in the wall
5,Dr. Seuss's first Book for Adults,"I was delighted to find an adult book by Dr. Seuss, and even more pleased to discover it's about brainy women! These pretty naked sisters come in all shapes and sizes and remind us of seven ""horse truths"" as they fulfill an oath and earn the right to wed their ""peeping"" beloveds. This story is fun and light spirited, easy to read with tasteful cartoons. I share it with all my (women) friends. Maybe someday I'll share it with my guy friends, they would like the action/adventure parts, there's only one virtual explosion and a little drinking, not really the stuff of today's popular novels, but, hey, it was originally published in 1939, and there is lots of nudity...."
5,So many wonderful flavors of Honey,"This CD is a surprise, a good surprise. I thought that maybe one or two tracks would be notable but every track is catchy. This is worth a listen; it is not repetative at all."
3,Hanson copy...,"They have a good sound it seems... but what they are is a bad copy of Hanson (I'm sorry to break this to you) Not Hanson's new album (This Time Around) but MON, that's why so many old Hanson fans now like the Moffatts, which is quite sad to me. Kinda like N'Sync is a copy of BSB. I'm not saying that they don't have talent (I've never seen them sing). ""Misery"" appears to be a cool song, but that's all I really care for (all the other ones are too sappy) anyhoo, that's just what I think. Hope I helped."
5,Awesome,"Wow me being a guy, i though hanson(hanson blows big balls by the way. But i love this cd,misery is a good rock song, and so is written all over ur heart, and if u want to get soft and muchy but have that little edge u got i'll be there for you. BSB AND NSYNC BLOW EACH other EACH NIGHT WITH HANSON TAKIN NOTES AND FILMIN.EMAIL ME IF U THIN I AM WRONG"
3,*~Kool CD!!~*,"I just love the song ""Misery"" so I thought I'd check out the rest of their songs...and they all are really cool!! I am planning to try and find this album.Actually I have a bit of a crush on Clint too. But really, this is a great cd it deals with all the emotions of young, new and old love."
3,Shows lots of promise,"I didn't know exactly what to expect when I bought this, not having heard anything more than the video for ""Until You Loved Me"". Being a guitar rock and jangly pop fan I have to say I like the up-tempo 'rockier' songs much better. I hope they leave the 'love ballads' behind and keep going in the direction of the thrashier songs like the last hidden track. From reading about their current influences I am hopeful they'll go that way. I know marketing says they should keep going for the teeny-bopper girl audience, but these guys really seem to have a lot of talent and they'll need to keep progressing in order to have their music taken seriously. They're another in along line of great Canadian bands, the best (IMHO) being 54-40 who are also from Vancouver."
2,I've heard better!,"The Moffatts are not horrible but they come close. I have a tiny bit of respect for them, but not much. They are a total copy of Hanson. They are such followers!"
1,really boring,"man, this cd was so dull it be puttin me to sleep. they're just another lame boy band. sorry. if you like that type of stuff maybe you'll like this cd. all the songs were too much about love. if you want some real music. get godsmack, lo-fidelity all-stars, beastie boys, and slayer"
1,Extremely boring except for 1 song.,"I found this CD very boring. At least, the Moffatts co-wrote a lot of the songs on Chapt.1. This is the only positive thing I can say about them.I only like Fustration, one of the two hidden songs of Chapt.1. I think the other songs are all very annoying and formulaic pop rock songs. Don't buy this CD."
5,i think this rocks,"i was skeptical at first, i'm ashamed to admit, but now i think the moffatts are really talented....i love their song ""misery"" i read somewhere that scott wrote it about a girl he was crazy about after one date at the time.....anyways rock on moffatts!"
5,It was better beyond my vocabulary of words!,"The Moffatts aren't just brothers (yup that's true) their a band to fulfill what they want. They write/perform/sing wonderful music because they want to. They are funloving guys. I like the song Girl of my Dreams, I think it's very dreamy and you can visualize the Moffatts being sweet when you they take you out on a date or something like that. I haven't quite yet heard the bonus tracks yet, but I'll bet their be just like their other songs, the best! Thanks, take care and God Bless!"
5,THE MOFFATTS CD ROX FROM A MOFFATT FAN IN USA,I LOVE HANSON AND WHEN I HEARD THE MOFFATTS CD I WAS LIKE WOW THEY ARE SOO GOOD THEN I GOT THE CD FOR MY BDAY NOW THE MOFFATTS R MY #2 FAV BAND HANSON ALWAYS #1
3,uhhhhhhhhhh,"hmmmm....well I usually don't buy shiz like this but they looked cute. Call me artificial or whatever, I don't care. I was thinking they were gonna be a lot like Hanson, luckily they WEREN'T and needless to say, I was a little blown away. Misery is the bomb and they sound really good. The only thing that bothered me was that EVERY motherf'n song was about love....seems a little pretentious, eh? well the cd was worth the $$$ so i'm happy."
3,"cool,but HANSON ROCKS","I LIKE THE MOFFATTS ,BUT TAY HANSON IS SO DREAMY! SCOTT IS MY FAV OF THE AUSOME MOFFATTS."
2,OK People... not that great!,"Don't get me wrong, I think these guys are very talented but they need work! Maybe get a vocal coach to improve the ""squeaks"". I didn't like this CD much. They need to harmonize better."
5,The best!,"This cd is one of the most diverse albums I have ever heard. They have songs like ""miss you like crazy"" but then there is a totally different song like ""misery"". They are such different songs. I love it. It is my fave cd right now. I just cant stop listening to it.Another thing, they didnt copy hanson. THey have been out in the public way longer then hanson has. They started pop music in 1996, so there is no possible way that they could have heard of hanson, knew they were going to be big and copy them. They started to grow up and listened to different music, they wanted to do the music they listened to and was influenced by. I love hanson to death though, dont get me wrong, itz just that the moffatts are not copying them."
5,the moffats 4 guys with talent,"The moffatts are not new to the canadan music scene, and it shows. On this cd they now what their fans want, songs written by them, played and sung by them. They are a very talented, cute, and sweet group of guys who deserve more credit than they get."
5,I love this cd their new style is so great!,"THe moffatts/ new cd Chapter 1:a new beginning is always in my cd player! I have always loved the moffatts even when they had a more country style but their new style/ to me, is even better, the moffatts are all i have listened to in the past month! They are great performers, too and they deserve every ounce of fame that they get...Thanx!!"
2,The're TOTALLY coping Hanson!!!,"This cd is OK, but all the songs are about love! That's kinda annoying. Plus, they are totally coping Hanson's act because they think it will make them popular because of all the Hanson fans out there. That makes me mad (because I am like the biggest Hanson fan ever- well maybe not ever...) and if that's really why they did that, there's nothing I can do but say it's kind of annoying. This cd is not my favorite, but it isn't all that bad. So if ya want this cd, buy it, but there's other music out there that you might like more."
5,The Moffatts Rock,Hi I would just like to say that this album is wonderful. The four new songs that they have written with Glenn Ballard are excellent. They have done extremely well and have had support from the very beginning from their Mom and Dad. Congratulations for getting this far and good luck for the future.
5,I luv it!!!!!!!!,The Moffatts rock. They are my favorite band. They're all so hot. I love the C.D. Their voice make me melt. I luv them so much!
3,Typical anime. lots of waiting for action,"This dvd, stays somewhat loosely along the comic story of witchblade, but my main complaint is that its full of exposition. The animation and artwork is great, but the story moves along very slowly. Lots of shots of people talking and not much else."
4,Engaging Backstory Overcomes Annoyances,"I'd thought I reviewed this but apparently it went into an amazon black hole.Essentially, I find the overall epic backstory of the witchblade engaging and fresh. I love the idea of a weapon choosing the owner, of the woman being the proper vessel and of the ultimate power being a horror as well as a gift.These big ideas are enough to chew on and frankly, enough to help me get past some of the annoying story elements like the cartoonishly large breasts, the bizarre sexual fetishization scenes when the witchblade takes over and the rather off putting mother/daughter role reversal.It's enough that I'll be back for volume two..."
4,Decent crossover anime,"Witchblade is an American comic book converted to Japanese anime. In most respects the original concept is brought over but the genre conventions remain traditional. Technically, the quality of the animation is very good. The storyline is ok if a tad predictable.Overall, Witchblade is a good, but by no means great, DVD."
4,"Mesmerizing, compelling, a great series.","The premise seems simple enough. Take a single mom, throw in some mutant monsters, an ancient powerful weapon, and a tooth-achingly sweet daughter who is in many ways far more mature than her mother. Add a bit of violence, some well delivered one-liners, and fan-service (oh boy do you get some great fan service here!) and its destined to be great.I am not a great fan of dubbing, most dubs I have seen seem off. The voices don't fit the character or there just seems to be a lack of emotion on the part of the voice actor, but this series is different. Whether its Rihoko's sweet voice, Masane's somewhat childish banter, or Marry's distinctly gravely, almost female impersonator, voice they all seem to gel well in these first 4 episodes. In fact that's the only thing I didn't like about this buy. Volume 1 is only 4 episodes! It leaves you hungry for more so fast, the first four barely scratch the surface of what you can tell will be a great story."
5,Speed Racer-Volume 2.......,"Mostly everyone I know considers Speed Racer to be the 'Godfather' of all Anime. Released here in the 60s, it quickly had people here clamoring for more Japanese cartoons and with good reason. Speed Racer, Volume 2 has Speed racing around the globe in the Mach 5 and continuing his adventures.This season, he goes up against the likes of:Ali Ben Schemer, Cornpone Brotch, Mr. Cumulus, Kim Jugger, and even Racer X.I'll admit, I loved the first season. But, I love this season even more. There a couple of memorable episodes here that are my favorites. I highly recommend this to any anime fan or fan of the Speed Racer movie that recently came out.There's very little in the way of extras but, still, it's well worth getting to see a big craze in American history. America loved its' Speed Racer back in the 70s!!!!"
4,Still an all time favorite!,"For some reason, Speed Racer stands out as one of my all time favorite cartoons from the 70's. Catchy theme music, simple adventurous story lines made it an all time favorite. Very enjoyable to view as an adult!"
5,"here he comes , again and speed looks better than ever","this second set of the speed racer cartoons is a fans dream and the transfers are top notche. i watch these shows with my kids and the love speed as much as i do so i give these transfers a 5. go speed racer, go speed racer go!!!!!!!!!!"
3,For a fan of the Speed Racer anime series,"This is the second volume of episodes released for the original Speed Racer anime series. It contains twelve episodes, and has very little in the way of special features. It's obvious that the company who put this together did it ""on the cheap""; however, fans of the Speed Racer anime series should have this is their collection. Since these releases are the only way to get the episodes on DVD, Speed Racer fans will have to purchase this item in order to have all the episodes."
1,Speed Racer -Episodes 12-23,The DVD I got did not have the light up or music feature as advertised and reviewed. I was very disappointed after already knowing that there was a sub par duplicate copy and expected the orignial as reviewed and advertised. This item should say not as orignally produced
4,5yr old LOVEs it (again and again),My 5 yr old loves playing this game again and again. Can't figure out the password at the end though...
5,Mystery Fun!!!,"This game is so mysteriously fun! I can't wait to finish the whole game. There are a lot of cool monsters to fight, and my favorite character to be is Daphne Blake. There are tons of clues that you have to find, and it's kind of a hard game to play, which is good because games that are too easy are boring. Oh, I almost forgot, you can find cool Scooby-Doo 2 toys at Burger King in their Kids' Club Meals. I hope you enjoy the video game as much as I do. By the way, I'm going to see Scooby-Doo 2 the movie tomorrow after school. Gotta go play the game now - see ya!"
1,wrath of God???,"Hurricanes are not God's wrath.Hurricanes are ""natural"" disasters that take place because we live in a fallen world that WE are responsible for, not God. God didn't make Adam sin in the Garden of Eden, satan did!Stop blaming God!God is not mad at us, He's not even in a bad mood!"
1,No good,I don't know why this book is still in print. The pool section is terrible and the billiard section is worse. Don't waste your money.
2,NOT SO INFORMATIVE,"This video contains very little information for anyone traveling for the first time to Rome, and it is made for people traveling with a big budget. No tips on how to save money."
4,Hard to Find Book - Delivered,I rated this a 4 because i received a hard to find book and it was delivered quickly and it good shape. I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because it probably was not in as good a shape as the description implied.
5,Ordered them by accident... so glad I did!,"I wasn't really paying attention when I ordered these, and thought they were larger targets. However, I took them to the range along with what I had left of my other targets, and proceeded to fall in love with them.I start out the day by putting out a couple of typical splatter targets. The ones I use have 5 bullseyes on them. Then when the ceasefire is called, and I'm done feeling bad about the groups I printed, I just stick these little guys over the shot up ones centers of the targets and dot the stray holes caused by my abysmal marksmanship.If you're a halfway decent shot, and using a rifle, 3"" is all you need."
5,You shoot you see,If you want to see your shot these are for you. I have used these for air gunsand powder burners. If I had to be critical I'd say make them more sticky.
5,Impresson of purchase,"It's very fun.Also,it's very useful.I want to buy more.I will use this item for my good experience."
1,This is getting embarassing!,"Well....another flailing attempt to keep the Empire Brass afloat. Unfortunately, it's painfully clear that she's taking on water; alot of it! Rolf's sound has been deteriorating rapidly since his Grammy-nominated Haydn/Hummel album and now sounds almost like a percussion instrument instead of a trumpet!Bravo to the BU grads....you sound great. It's hard to believe that just 10 years ago, you were all BU students and now you ARE the Empire Brass and Rolf is very obviously simply along for the ride.In my opinion, the last three Empire Brass albums are complete garbage. They compromise not only the integrity of the original Class Brass CD, but the integrity of the Telarc label as a whole.If you're a serious brass music enthusiast, I suggest looking into the London Brass or the Center City Brass Quintet recordings.Pity!"
2,Poor Quality,We got this tape player as one of my 3 year old's birthday gifts. To begin with the sound quality was quite poor. Secondly the microphone had a relativly small button that had to be held down to make the microphone work...which was dificult for our 3 year old. I've heard great reviews about the fisher price tuff stuff tape player from other moms...I believe we will try to exchange this item.
1,Not included,"I am very disappointed in this item. The original Barbie Karaoke machine came with an electrical cord so one did not have to run it only on batteries. It also came with an auxilary cable so it could be attached to another player for taping from CDs. Now I get the newest Karaoke machine with neither of those items for the same price as the original! There is no place on the site to purchase the items which are now ""optional"". A cord to plug it in is optional? What a rip off!"
2,should have gotten an electric pump!,"The pump works, but you do get a workout inflating a 2 person Kayak. I also have lower back problems and more than a few times I had to stop pumping for a short rest. My biggest complaint the PRESSURE GUAGE does not work. The needle don't move. If anyone knows a trick to get the guage to work please let me know."
1,Buyer Beware,"I am a tremendous fan of Ms. Jakeman's Lord Ambrose Mysteries, which are as well plotted as they are well written. This novel, however, is very disturbing. Yes, I had to finish it - but I sincerely regret my curiosity. Ms. Jakeman is such a good writer that the scenes of horror are indelibly printed on my mind. And they are revolting. Was this necessary? I believe a writer with as much talent as she has could have captured her audience in another way. Buyer beware."
4,excellent guidance,"this book was an excellent source of information. i'm relatively new to the massage business and have several pregnant clients. the author explained the do's and don'ts clearly and, believe it or not, in an interesting format!i liked it so much that i've purchased it for a pregnant friend, just so she'll be armed with appropriate information when looking for a massage therapist (she lives in another state from me :-))"
2,Lots of Medical Terminology,"This book was designed as a textbook companion to a continuing education class for massage therapists. Without attending the class, it's not an interesting read. It is written with an unnecessary level of medical terminology, when layman's terms would suffice. I am a massage therapist, and didn't find this book to be very helpful at all. I found a few tips, but in general, bodywork techniques are labeled & then glossed over. ""Massage During Pregnancy"" by Bette Waters is a better educational resource on pregnancy & comfort tips for the pregnant woman. However, I'm still looking for an effective resource manual of massage therapy techniques for the pregnant client."
3,"Good facts, one of many techniques","So, Osborne-Sheets has a lot of good factual information here about what is going on in a pregnant woman's anatomy/physiology as it relates to massage. She is the leader in pre-natal massage information. Her technique, however is not the only way to give pre-natal massage. So, take it with a grain of salt. This might be hard to do, since she clearly believes her technique is the only way to massage a pregnant woman, and every one else is just wrong or endangering their client. Don't believe the hype and take the book for what it is worth, more information to take into consideration."
3,Good Comprehensive Review,"I was reading this book as a pre-req to the certification class I'm taking next week. I do feel prepared going into the class, however, I believe this book should be read with the intent of taking a class with it. It is very thorough regarding all aspects of pregnancy and how massage therapists can better serve their clients, without going out of the scope of our practice. Some aspects seemed just a little outdated (like all of the pictures were taken right out of the 70s) but overall a great book if you are looking to specialize in Pre Natal Massage Therapy."
2,Only comprehensive to practioners'.,Without any previous education in massage therapy I was completely lost.
3,A Step in the Right Direction,"It seems to me that the War in the Mediterranean during World War Two has not been covered in the way it deserves. Granted it was a sideshow but none the less it deserves better than it has gotten so far.This DVD is a step in the right direction. While it is a light weight and should not be considered a magnus opus. It does cover a lot of area no matter how briefly of a lot of Places, Persons,, Events and Battles that deserve mention. I especially like the part on the Role of Malta that it played in the War. Also it did cover the fights in Syria and Eastern Africa that are usally overlooked. For the money its not a bad deal!"
5,Perfect for travel!,"I really loved this toothpowder. I didn't have to worry about having a liquid/gel while traveling. It lasted me the whole 10 weeks we were gone and I would say I used about 1/2 the bottle. Nice taste, though it's something you have to get used to, and left my mouth feeling very fresh."
1,Can't Recommend,"Purchased ""Original Mint"". It may pass through airline inspection, but the taste is awful--bitter and unpleasant."
4,tooth powder airplane,"bought to carryon flights... soon after tsa changed the rules, will keep in reserve in case the carryon rules change again"
1,Item was already opened,The container was open when I received it so I would not use it. It could have been tampered with. Would never buy this type of product again from Amazon.
3,fresh breath,Wanted the lightest weight possible for backpacking. Eco-dent worked well packed in a tiny ziplock bag using the top part of a toothbrush. It worked better than just plain baking soda as it had a mint flavor and better texture.
5,Refreshing Clean Taste,"i love the product. i'll never go back to toothpaste. Great refreshing mint taste and mouth feels ""squeaky-clean"""
4,Girls' Bootie Photo Album,"I had seen this in the store previous to ordering it. This photo album is soft, classic, and beautiful. With two slots for photos per page, it was perfect for the memory book we made for the Mom-to-be."
5,VAMPIRE GAME GEAR,"Vampire Is a PLATFORMER In The Style Of CASTLEVANIA. The LEVELS,ENEMIES,POWERUPS,ETC Are All Early CASTLEVANIA CLONES. But, In a Good Way. It Executes All The Areas VERY WELL! If You Want a DECENT GAME For Your GAME GEAR, This Is ONE OF THE FEW. And a MUST HAVE For CASTLEVANIA FANS!"
4,Touching And Powerful!,"I've been familiar with the Tony Perry 3 for many years now. I purchased their first album and was very pleased with what I heard. I was exstatic when I heard that they were releasing their second album ""On the Innocent side"". It is now a permenent fixture in my cd player. It seems to have the ability to pick up my mood after a long day. The power of this groups music makes you want to sing with them and release all the frustrations of the day. The original lyrics are very touching and home grown. I think anyone who listens to this album will think that the singer is refering to his or her life. I highly recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys the rhythym of life"
5,A hidden gem,"Tony Perry is the best undiscovered act out there--or I should say, undiscovered outside central Pennsylvania. Here in the midstate, he's a fixture in nearly everyone's CD collections. Always high quality, always interesting."
4,Read before you visit Rhodes,"Read before you visit the island . As you stroll the medieval walled city you will find yourself thinking of the last Europeans to defend Christendom this close to Asia. It was the Turk who came here in the two sieges described. The Knights of St. John were deposed during the second siege and were allowed to leave, eventually reestablishing the Hospitallers in Malta. Look for evidence of the blood and carnage of the sieges as you walk this stop on the summer cruise route. Hangings, beheadings, Knights of Christ and Ottoman Turks alike displaying the heads of their enemies on dripping pikes;Could all this have really happened here in this jewel in the blue Aegean? Yes it did and the story of it is written for the history buff and traveler alike in this short entertaining book"
4,Harder than expected!,"The erection was harder than I expected, but once we figured out how it worked I realized that the second time it would be much easier and faster to install.The instructions were not very good, but I think the next time I'll be able to do it by myself.One of the days was windy and the ropes and ties came very handy and stood up really well."
5,Good Product/fast shipping,"I didn't know if this would be any good, since it was such a bargain and with free shipping. It is just what I wanted. I like it a lot and I am delighted with the deal I got. Shipping took three days."
1,Terrible waste of money!,"I received this product from Amazon, used it twice before the frame broke. It was over 30 days, therefore I cannot get a refund from Amazon Marketplace. Horrible waste of money! Even worse policy by Amazon!"
1,"Easy setup, but terrible quality!","Well, I just bought this because one of the reviewers said it was good quality, however, it is not (wondering if they have taken it down and set it back up again yet). Very simple to setup, but I set it up once and after a week, I took it down because of storm was coming. When I went to set it up again (only after one week), I noticed 2 of the metal bars/poles had already broken apart! It is of no use to me now. I'm hoping I can return it because I've only had it for 2 weeks."
4,There needs to be a sequel,"I really enjoyed this book, but it really needs a sequel. It was very easy and enjoyable book to read, but I think everyone must know what happened to Joy and Gabe, and if Christopher ever gets another true love. Could that true love be Joy? Stay tuned to see what happens next."
4,A Lovely Surprise,"Although Wedding Season is witty and smart and has enough laughs to go around, there's a quiet poignancy that sneaks up on you and makes this book worth your attention. The protagonist has constructed this protective edifice of belief around herself, and Cosper orchestrates events so that they keep challenging and prodding Joy's world until a deeper truth is revealed. The book sneaks up on you with a quiet accumulation of telling details which add up to a complicated, humane and real character - just as it does in life! Ignore the naysayers below - I don't know what book they were reading."
3,Standard but entertaining,"I enjoyed this book and took it for what it is - cheesy chic-lit that's been done a hundred times over! It wasn't the best book I've read, nor was it the worst and I will be sharing it with my friends so they can come to their own conclusions. It did keep me interested and I wanted to keep reading it. That said, I would recommend it."
2,A dull & disappointing read...,"This is the first book in a while that I've been less than impressed with. I was glad to finish it so I could move on to something else. It is very obvious that this is the author's first work...at times the working is confusing and because of that, it is often unclear who is speaking. There are WAY TOO MANY characters in the book, many with little or no importance to the bigger story. She provides too much detail, it seems the first half of the book was dedicated to building the plot - too much! Ultimately I was quite bored with this one and am glad to be done with it...I won't even mention the less than impressive ending!!"
2,Boring and Joyless,"This book was pretty boring. Joy, the heroine, was annoying. Her boyfriend, Gabe (as mentioned below) was never really developed into a true character. Many of the minor characters were obnoxious. Joy was way too caught up on her principles to enjoy life. The premise of this book was great. I enjoyed the frantic pace of the weddings coming right on top of each other, but I could not get over Joy (or Joyless as one of the people in the book called her). The only redeeming part of the book were the weddings, and a mildly amusing episode of dress confusion."
2,"A Library Loan, not a Buying Book","I actually borrowed this book because I'd heard about the ending and was interested to see how the author handled it.It's not awful but it could have been SO much better. It's an interesting premise but the heroine's situation (17 weddings in six months) and dilemma are rather contrived and the author went through contortions to get to her chosen ending. The characters (far too many) are mostly stock creations and hard to care about, and Cosper obviously never heard of the maxim ""show, don't tell.""It's a fair first novel but I agree with other reviewers that her editors should have sent it back for a few more revisions. Jane Austen (or even Austen-like), it is not.Bottom line, it's a light read for when you don't want to have to think too much."
2,I'm usually easy to please,"I was excited about reading this book, because I read quite a few articles of praise. However, I didn't see all of the great qualities that some of the critics saw.This is not to say that the book was terrible. But, I am easy to please, and when I finished this book all I could say was, ""what in the heck was that?""There are a lot of characters, and I had a hard time keeping them straight. The main character was a nightmare. First of all, you aren't on her side because she is such a negative skeptic, and secondly she is a stick-in-the-mud.The beginning was hard to get through, the middle a bit easier, and then BAM! You are hit with an ending that makes you want to sign the main character up for intense therapy.I am glad I finished the book, but I have definitely read better chic-lit."
2,Disappointing,"I read this book for a book club. Although it is outside my usual areas of interest, I was ready to be entertained and/or enlightened.I did not really enjoy this book. I found the main character unsympathetic, and there were too many peripheral characters. The plethora of peripheral characters made it hard to keep them all straight and also prevented the author from fully developing them, so they all ended up seeming very two-dimensional.Also, I disliked the ending. I felt that the author lost interest in her book just prior to the last two chapters (as had I) and made a desperate attempt to wrap things up."
1,Couldn't finish reading it!,Don't waste your money on this book. Don't even waste your time picking up a copy at the library. The characters are over the top and the author's writing style is cumbersome. It's one of the few books I couldn't bring myself to finish reading.
1,Agree with most of the reviews,"Like a lot of the posts on here, I agree that this book wasn't great. I read it for a book club and I found the writing and the ending so disappointing. Yes, I think it was good that it was a different twist/ending from what you would usually expect from ""chicklit"", but it just wasn't done in the right way. It didn't leave me happy, sad, nothing. Just kinda blah. Not worth. Wouldn't read it again."
3,I can't give it 5 stars,"Where to begin. I picked this book up, thinking it would be a fluffy Sophie Kinsella-esque read. I was wrong. It did start out slowly, but I grew to like the main character, Joy, and her perfect boyfriend Gabe. Though I liked Joy, however, I found it very difficult to sympathize with her and I cringed as I watched her make bad decision after bad decision. Her last decision was the worst; Gabe was perhaps correct in his summation of Joy...she just wants to be right."
2,The main character is this book's biggest flaw,"The good points of this book -- good writing in places; interesting descriptions of the various weddings; and a really fascinating job that I wish I'd thought of (an anonymous free-lance writing firm called Invisible Inc). Bad points -- WAY too many characters to keep track of; overly-colorful secondary characters that are so exaggerated they're stereotypes; and an annoying, neurotic heroine. This last is what will probably keep me from attempting this book again. It's impossible to enjoy a book when you have so little sympathy for the main character. It should be possible to be against marriage for whatever reasons without judging other people who are not against it and making their lives totally miserable along with your own."
5,Not Chick Lit!! Awesome!,"I enjoyed this book. I found it to be something different than the ""and everyone lives happily ever after"" formula that so many novels stick to these days. (Nor does everyone die of misery at the end. If you want details of the story, read other reviews!) This is in no way ""chick lit,"" at least in my opinion, and if you want a light fluffy vapid read to get ideas for your wedding, don't bother with this. I'm a little tired of the light and happy chick lit genre, and I found this to be a refreshing change. Good writing, Darcy Cosper! I look forward to more!"
2,pretentious,"Darcy Cosper is a thinker not a writer. She gets so caught up in Joy's principles that she neglects the plot. Though she does have some insightful thoughts on the institution of marriage in todays society, she forgets to resolve anything in her book. Joy's stance on marriage is obviously derived from her parents divorce. What happens between Joy and Gabe? More importantly what about Joan? I would have liked to see more of what happened to her and her pathetic excuse for a husband. And Chris? unresolved. When writing a book it is in my opinion that you resolve or at least explain the problems of the characters thoroughly. Obviously Darcy Cosper is more intersted in getting her own opinions across than writing a story. She should be writing for newspapers and magazines. she should not be writing books."
1,Should have been a lot better...,"I am so disappointed by this book. By the time I hit page 15, I felt like I'd read at least 100 pages. It's such a shame, since the plot has the potential to be really really funny. Instead, the book is really really wordy -- so wordy that it almost feels like you're reading a college lit book. Too bad the Shopaholic Lady didn't think of this book first -- I'm sure she would have did a lot better job. Reader beware..."
2,Enough already,"Enough already with the author's and the publisher's blabbering on about the Jane Austen connection. This is not at the level of Jane Austen. I don't think Jane Austen could have stomached observing this world. And Jane Austen was a true talent. There is a fair amount of pretention to the writing, and perhaps too much flattery given to the airhead fluttering about Manhattan with a martini in her hand, pretending to be Deep and Smart. Yes, there is a bit too much effort showing in the writing...especially in terms of the attempts to be Deep and Smart. And Witty. And Philosophical. And just so Clever. Who are these people writing the rave reviews? The author? The agent? The agent's and the author's friends?"
3,17 weddings and a funeral,"So, there isn't technically a funeral in the novel. The funeral, in my opinion, should be held for the plot of this ho-hum novel. The protagonist, Joy Silverman, is not the marrying kind. Despite this fact, she has to endure seventeen weddings of her family and friends. Sounds like the makings for a great social comedy, right? Well, this one falls a bit short.Joy's cynical personality gets annoying at times, and while some of her friends' characters have so much personality, they end up as ridiculous stereotypes for the most part.While this book has a different take on the concept of modern marriage, its lackluster plot was ultimately a disappointment to this avid reader."
4,Wedding Season,"With tight, honest dialogue and a swift pace, Cosper's novel is one to savor. The story's success is a balancing act between true reflection upon the rites of passage of engagement and marriage and sheer hilarity. Joy Silverman is a 21st century Jane Austen character with a bite! Wedding Season is a terrific summertime read."
4,I want to marry this book,"I'm not a fan of chick lit (sorry Bridget Jones), so when TWO friends recommended it, I squirmed - until one gave me a copy. I wound up buying my own. Why? I was completely drawn to the cheekily named ""Joy,"" a truly great darkly-comic character (I'm also a hopeless bitter-romantic, so the notion of attending a flurry of weddings with her rather than a cutely neurotic modern-day Doris Day was a relief). This is a meaningful, insightful, dead-on read, perfect for any season (even summer). I can't wait for the movie - I'm hoping they cast Wynona Ryder, who could get the comeback she needs with Wedding Season!"
1,BORING!!!!,"I was so excited to read this book, and I couldn't even make it past page 30!! It is SO LONG and SO BORING! Half the time you can't even keep up with the characters, let alone who is male and female. The author is way to wordy and jumps around too much. It was a good idea for a book, however, the author just doesn't know how to write. Stay away unless you need a lot of sleep!"
5,This cd swings!,"If anyone knows swing it's Ray Anthony.From Glenn Miller's trumpet section, at age 18, to the present,he,probably better than anyone appreciates the ""new"" popularity of swing. The album features clean phrasing and a great ensemble blend. Every section has all-star players. ""Route 66"", ""Opus One"" and ""Swing-A-Ding-Ding"" are highlights. Vocalists Madeline Vergari and Patrick Tuzzolino are both very good. A nice mix of old and new tunes. Ray's trumpet is as rich as ever. Lead man Rick Baptist heads a dynamite trumpet section. This band is tight! Ray, go ahead and start on Swing Club II."
1,THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE WORST RAY ANTHONY CD EVER........,I have been a Ray fan for many decades but I am very disappinted in this cd. To begin with Ray took the piano out of the rhythm section. Then he tried to put a lot of vocals in. Then he took the melody out of the music. I don't know who advised Ray but they did a terrible job. I have many wonderful cds by Ray that I can still enjoy. These are the ones I will listen to but not this cd.
3,Works well ... Mostly,"I've had this Toshiba DVD VCR combo for well over a year. Everything is still functioning very well. I've found it very easy to setup, use and program.The VCR part is the weakest of the system and after a few months of use it developed a VERY annoying squeak that will drive a person insane while watching or recording any tape. It doesn't always do it though, like when you bring it in for repair (of course). Luckily I use the VCR half very infrequently.I think I paid around $80 for it, so I guess it's not too bad for a less expensive combo unit."
2,Toshiba...or is it?,"The front exterior of this unit is made by Toshiba but the insides are manufactured by LG Electronics, which makes Zenith products.I had to return mine within a week. The DVD player worked fine, and so did the VCR, except for the fact that the timer record function proved unreliable. Sometimes the machine would simply not record when it was supposed to; other times it would not turn off after it was finished recording.Also, the timer recording screen was very tedious to use.Amazon.com makes returns extremely easy, so I did not get stuck with a unit that I might have otherwise been forced to send to a service center and wait who knows how long to get repaired."
2,Problems!,"This combo unit would have received atleast 4 stars if it wern't for a pretty big problem that has already been identified by [another reviewer].The first machine I had would not record from the timer all the time. Hoping it was just a lemon, I returned it but after a few weeks it failed again to record from the timer. Luckily it is under extended guarantee so I hope to return it for a DIFFERENT MODEL."
1,So bad it's funny,"The album comes in around 3200 seconds? Is this guy kidding? This book is so bad it's (almost) funny... I'm a big fan of the 33 1/3 line of books, think the ones on Doolittle and Exile on Main St. are pretty close to Required Reading for Pixies and Stones fans... But... this one, on OK Computer... says way, way too much about the author, and his hyper-intellectual style of ultra-academic analysis... and almost nothing about either Radiohead or OK Computer! The 33 1/3 editors need to throw this one back and try again with somebody who can actually shed a little light on such a widely admired title..."
1,The weakest in the series,This book was like reading stereo instructions on how to listen to music which given a choice I would no sooner do than read instructions on how to laugh.
1,horrid waste of time,"Let me begin by saying that I am a fan of the 33 1/3 series (I have read many and have others at home waiting in the wings to read) and a huge fan of radiohead and this album. Dai Griffiths (the author) writes so impassionately about this album that you feel that deep down he loathes the task that has been appointed to him. in the few times that he has something vaguely interesting to say it has nothing to do with radiohead, ok computer, but instead talks about some differences between vinyl vs. cds.This book is so boring and infuriating that i put it down many times swearing that i would never pick it up again, i finished only because i hate not finishing books (especially when they are so short). don't by this book so that you can continue to appreciate this great series and this great album."
2,"Nice read, but unremarkable","I bought this at the record store maybe a month after I got OK Computer thinking that it would open things up.It didn't. Where 33 1/3's XO brought a new level of depth to the Elliott Smith album of the same name within pages, the entirety of this book passes with only a few, if any, eye opening ideas. There are pages and pages where the write casually describes things that are not only obvious, but can very easily be learned by half-halfheartedly looking on wikipedia.Without a central thesis or thematic arguments, the book never builds beyond a few decent observations (There's literally a line that goes ""In conclusion... OK Computer is a diverse collection of songs..."" Really.); however, any Radiohead novice looking to pick up a few insights might enjoy this as a decidedly light and casual read."
1,An absolute waste...,"If you have any interest in learning about Radiohead's amazing album ""OK Computer"", then I implore you NOT to buy this book. The author, Dai Griffiths, wastes a full 34 pages before even beginning to discuss ""OK Computer"". In the first 34 pages the author covers topics like ""The CD Album"", ""Against The CD Album: the continued presence of the vinyl model"", and ""Genuinely Extended Song Forms"". Once the reader has labored through all the un-needed minutae the author thought was pertinent for the reader to understand the story of how ""OK Computer"" came to be, it's all academic. None of the chapters cover the artistic area of the album's creation or the artist's emotions. Dai Griffiths would be a wonderful writer to hire for the writing of a math or science text book, but for god's sake keep this writer away from the arts"
1,This book sucked,"Wow. I thought because OK Computer was such a good album this book would probably be pretty good. But then I read it. The writing is so stale and unemotional that the author is unable to actually articulate what the album means to anyone. Instead, she uses chords and stupid bpm graphs to talk about the songs and othing about their emotional weight. Plain and simple, This book SUCKED don't waste your money on it. Buy the one on Let it Be by the Replacemnts instead."
4,Correcting Joseph Pierre's Error,I have not read the book though I would like to. However I am writing to notify all readers of these reviews of the DANGEROUS ERROR in Joseph Pierre's review of Persephone's Quest : Entheogens and the Origins of Religion. The mistake Mr. Pierre makes is in identifying the Fly Agaric mushroom as a source of psilocybin. It certainly is not a source of psilocybin and nor has Mr. Wasson claimed that it is. Merely an unfortunate error on Mr. Pierre's part. As he does note - the Fly Agaric mushroom is quite deadly. Psilocybin comes from different mushrooms - notably from the psilocybin and some panaeoulus varieties. READER OF THESE REVIEWS: BE FOREWARNED!!!
4,to clear the air,"If you are interested obtaing knowlege of the fly agaric muchroom, the soma of the anceint vedic culture of Idia, this is a good book to start with. Most of the information given is helpful and is approached from an analytical point of view. but since i'm wrighting this, it i'm going to clear up some of the mistakes made in the other reviews. The fly agaric mushroom is quite toxic. However, if heated and dried proparly the ibotenic acid (the toxic chemical) is changed to muscimol making it non toxic. Also there is no psilocybin contained in this mushroom. check out this book it's a good read"
1,Don't waste your time or money,"Totally useless book...more like a nice travel brochure. Took us more time to order it (and return it) than to read it. If you need/want a book, spend the money and get a Lonely Planet instead."
2,What a rushed release without any consideration,"The Serious Sam for PC and other consoles have great graphics and with familiar type of controls as that of Doom, Quake, etc. This version for GBA has all the opposite qualties as just described. You can tell each pixels apart and it comes at you like a swarm of bees while jerks up and down, making you dizzy. The controls are simply terrible."
1,"Serious sam, serious piece of...","Cons:* Difficult to control* Very, very bad graphics* Aiming is totally flawed* Unfair enemies (the bull-like creature comes to mind)Pros:* Many weapons* Three different levels of difficulty* Seems (I haven't finished it yet) of very long lenght.Still, it is huge dissapointment: after playing in the PC for years, I know that Serious Sam is not a graphics powerhouse or anything like it, but this mess is too insulting to even consider."
2,Elevated price for low quality,"We speak of east-Central Europeans but in Fact, they have strong Central European identity. The book gives examples of nationalism from different parts of Central Europe but fails to expand on the most interesting nationalisms: German and Polish and this is something I am looking for..."
4,Nice,This is a gift for my son and until Christmas I won't know how well it works but I know he loves the show.
5,Absolutely love this show!,"This is such an amazing deal for this box set. All 24 episodes from the first season, on Bluray and DVD, for under $30? Best deal I've seen yet! I'm really into mystery and suspense, as well as the Victorian Age, so this is perfect. I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of any type of anime, you'll be hooked by the end of the first episode!"
5,Awsome Anime!,"I don't really know what I can say about this one. It was fantastic. The characters are all unique and likable. The story line was really good if not a little strange. The animation was crisp and never lacking and the english dub was excellent in my opinion, especially Ciel. One thing I loved about Black Butler was that it somehow blended most of the violence with some comedy. So if you enjoy dark, mysterious, violent comedies you will love this show. I will definitely be purchasing the second season. I would recommend this anime to someone in a heartbeat.-Simply one hell of a reviewer."
4,Awesome .... but flush the hot mangos,This is a solid release from Ian and the boys. However he should have flushed the hot mangos in the final cut. El Nino is an excellent hard rocker and AWOL establishes their prog leanings. Solid musicianship throughout this great CD. A fool made the comment that this band could not handle the Tull's early music in concert. I don't believe this after hearing this cd.
5,High Art,"A must have for all Jethro Tull fans. It is a remarkable thing to hear how uncompromised these men are as artists. Lyrically, musically TULLISH beyond words. My hair stood on end."
5,AWESOME!!! Best Tull album in years! An absolute MUST HAVE,"I've been a die-hard Tull fan since the mid 70s and have every album they've released. J-TULL DOT COM is their best new material in over 10 years. If you're a Tull fan, you MUST have this new album - you will not be disappointed. The lyrical content, depth of sound and Ian's flute playing are reminiscent of much older Tull albums. I've always enjoyed Tull's material from the 70's - there was more of an ""edge"" to the music and lyrics. While more polished than ""Living in the Past"", ""Warchild"" and ""Aqualung"", J-TULL DOT COM really grabs you and takes you for a ride. I found that it really got into my system - much more so that ""Catfish Rising"" or ""Rock Island"".Don't hesitate - GET J-TULL DOT COM!!! It's AWESOME!Also - you MUST see Jethro Tull live if you have the chance!"
5,Superb balance of old Tull elements and newer styles,"As with most of the Tull albums of the last 10 years, the first few times I listen to them I feel deflated and disappointed because the characteristic ""songs from the Wood"" and ""Heavy Horses"" style is fading away. But with time, this recording and many of the recent past come into their own and can be very enjoyable to listen to and expand the Tull experience."
4,Satisfying,"This is definitely a Tull album to rally around and get psyched about.. It grows on you with repeated listenings, doesn't go stale and breaks some new ground. Make sure to hear the hidden track after the last song listed. Tull is really rocking on this tape and I give the boys all the credit in the world for giving us fans yet another album to treasure. I wanted to also say that for some reason I can't find "" A Little Light Music "" from 1992 on Amazon's list, but its a live CD and its a Tull must. Also "" Bursting Out "" from 1978.. as far as Dot Com, its the best since ""Broadsword and The Beast"" of 1982 in my opinion. Out on a limb for some, but I still think it has advantages over Crest of a Knave .. what the heck .. this is a damn good album and we should feel lucky Tull is still Tull we are here to enjoy their true art. I have a feeling we will still have Tull into the new millenium."
4,A new edition of the consistantly changing Tull.,"First time through this, I was shocked at some of the lyrics. Just not what I was expecting...but the more I listen to it, the more I enjoy it. Even ""Hot Mango Flush"" has grown on me. Musically, the masterful Mr. Anderson delivers, as always. I'm glad to see Tull still has the desire to experiment a little, but stay recognizable. A must for Tull fans."
4,damn nice,"Upon repeated listenings, this is a beautifully crafted album .. all we want from Tull !! I really like it . I mean REALLY like it. My only complaint, is that on some of the tracks I think the drummer could have done more. Enough said. I love this album."
4,Crafted and Inspired Ian,"ALl in all a superb play by Ian and Andy Giddings on keyboards .. decent performance by Martin, but lackluster drumming by Doane Perry and perfunctory bass by Jonathan Noyce. I really like this CD a lot, but its really only because of Ian and Andy's work. I can't help but think Ian would do better with another gutarist sometimes.. also, I have to say I used to think Doane Perry was very good but I have to say this is the weakest I have ever heard him play drums. The album is as great as it can be considering the fact I think Ian should consider revamping the band. I know he would never get rid of Martin. But maybe a new drummer would serve Tull well."
2,"Great band, but a weak effort...","Jethro Tull is one of the best bands of all time, but J-Tull Dot Com is their weakest effort since the putrid Under Wraps way back in 1984. As always the instrumental work is strong, but the lyrics in most of the songs are ludicrous. ""Hot Mango Flush"", I believe the first song written by guitarist Martin Barre, is an embarrassment. ""Spiral"", ""AWOL"", and ""Far Alaska"" are decent songs, but if you're looking to get into Tull or if you don't have much of their classic material I recommend Thick as a Brick, Minstrel in the Gallery, Stand Up, or any of their other gems from 1968-1978."
1,Jethro Dull,"I consider myself excessively forgiving when it comes to Jethro Tull. I can usually find things to like in mediocre Tull records like ""Heavy Horses"", ""A"" or ""Catfish Rising"". ""Roots to Branches"", their last effort -- though I get the impression I was one of twenty people who bought it -- was actually pretty good. ""J Tull Dot Com"" is not. I have spun it several times, hoping to find that I was missing something. I wasn't. It's evident that Anderson still has a way with words, although he seems hard put to find anything to write about. His singing is mild. The music is tepid. Uninspired and uninspiring. A pity. Maybe next time."
4,"Jethro Tull Still Are Not ""Too Old To Rock And Roll""!","I have been a ""hard core"" Tull fan since 1975 and have attended their concerts. I was at first skeptical of J-Tull Dot Com, because of the silly album title and cover. Once I played the CD, I realized that Tull still can produce quality music and are not ""too old to rock and roll""! My favorite tracks are Sprial, Dot Com, and A Gift of Roses. I enjoy all of the tracks except Hot Mango Flush and Mango surprise, which are quite annoying, but tend to grow on you after a while. Overall, Dot Com is a great album. Ian Anderson can still write interesting and provocative lyrics and the musicians all do a superb job. I never get tired of listening to the CD and rank Dot Com right up their with Aqualung and Thick As A Brick. Jethro Tull can still put out some great rock-and-roll and I highly recommend this album to any one that enjoys classic/progressive rock."
4,Mike's right,"Mike from Philly is right! Dog Eared Years and Gift of Roses are worth the price alone. Bends Like a Willow is also strong - as a matter of fact the album gets stronger with each song, making the last half stronger than the first. How refreshing when so many of today's artists stack the hits up front, leaving the dregs at the end. Most current albums get worse as you get further in. To compare this to Aqualung of Thick as a Brick is like condemning Arthur Miller because every later play wasn't Death of a Salesman. A strong work by the most endlessly fascinating and under-appreciated (where are you Hall of Fame?) bands ever. The real test is ""do I listen to it?"" And the answer is yes - a lot!"
3,Good but not great,"As a Tull fan since the very beginning, I think I can judge a good Tull album from a bad one. This one's a good one-- not a classic, but not a dud. The second half of the CD is much better than the first half. Musicianship is superb all the way around, but the songs are just not as strong and compelling as those on ""Roots to Branches"" (which, IMHO, was the best Tull album since the 70s!). Still, any Tull is better than no Tull."
1,Ready to die!,"After enduring Hot Mango Flash, and barely comming out of the experience sane, I felt the remainder of my fortitude would help me navigate through the typhoon of scum and floatsom, that comprise the lyrics of this album, but then came Mango Surprise and now I have degenerated into a level of existance far below that of a feral primate!!"
2,Didn't Click,I am a loyal fan of Jethro Tull but I just didn't click with this album. The flute and instrumental arrangements were perfect and delightful as usual but something was missing.
2,"J-Tull Dot.Com--Nothing to ""e-mail"" home about.","I actually like the bonus track best on this album. Ian Anderson IS Jethro Tull, so I don't know how/why he puts out ""solo"" records under his own name instead of just recording as Tull. But it's there after ""A Gift Of Roses"" and it is quite good. ""Spiral"" is the typical opening rock track we have come to expect from Tull, and ""Dot.Com"" has been in my head all day...""I'll be yours, dot.com"" is catchy. The album is reminiscent of ""Roots To Branches."" I just wish Ian played more accoustic guitar on the album. It seems the flute is utilized too much and sounds forced on some tracks. Overall, this album is listenable and not half bad. I would like to see the band rock a bit more though. So, when is Ian's new album coming out...based on the bonus track, I have higher expectations for that one than the Tull release."
5,From a German Fan,I love the music from that band since 1977 and it was worth to wait four years and as usualy you need to listen to the new stuff more than one time... But than you will love it. Ina
1,"Oh Lord, please make the pain stop!","I thought that Hot Mango Flush was by far the worst song they ever wrote, until I heard its degenerate son, Mango Surprise. I agree with Ian Anderson that his dog-eared years are here. He should realize that he has scraped the bottom of his musical barrel, and he is feeding us the rotting dregs. After the experience of buying this album, I will most likely become a recluse, or become feral."
1,Oh no!,"Since 1979 Jethro Tull has produced very little worth listening to (with the exception of Crest of a Knave). When sorting through this bands plethora of works, j-tull.com should be left out."
2,It's been done,"Not much new here, a lot of flute playing and a lot of interesting music. The problem is, is that it's nothing new and therefore is not that interesting. You can pretty much buy any latter day Tull cd and get the same feel. If you like that about the band, then by all means, get this cd. Frankly, I expect more from such a talented band."
5,Best Tull album in 17 years,"As the author of the forthcoming ""Jethro Tull: A Musical Guide"" (with projected foreword by Ian Anderson), I say, ""It's about bloody time!"": a Tull album that harkens back to the band's golden age of the mid- to late-1970s. ""J-Tull Dot Com"" is pure Tull, a masterful blend of Celtic, Eastern Indian and Latin influences with hard rock. The songs ""The Dog Ear Years"" and ""A Gift of Roses,"" which are reminiscent of material on the band's masterpieces ""Songs from the Wood"" and ""Heavy Horses,"" are worth the price alone. After a series of hit-and-miss albums, ""Dot Com"" is most welcome, and new bassist Jonathan Noyce adds a powerful complement to the drumming of Doane Perry , typically ferocious guitar work of Martin Barre, and eclectic keyboard work of Andrew Giddings. Anderson's contributions on various flutes, acoustic guitar and bouzouki round out the sound nicely."
4,Satisfaction guaranteed,"Well, well yet another Tull album. How do they do it, one asks? Having been an ardent Tull supporter from the early days (circa Stand Up), I can honestly say there are few artists from whom I have derived so much listening pleasure over the years. Having declared my allegances, it must be said that Dot com does not stand amongst Tull's finest, but does this matter - I think not. There are some eminently hummable tunes on this album, and Martin Barre's guitar continues to embellish, as always. My overall rating stems from gratitude. Gratitude to Ian and the boys for being motivated to craft together yet another album for our listening pleasure. Thanks Ian."
1,Teeny Tiny and expensive,"This is not a book. This is a very short pamphlet for a lot of money (compare to almost any other of the books on blackjack). It is only 45 pages long, and those pages are only 3 inches by 5 inches ! All the information in the so-called book can be found elsewhere, cheaper, more organized, more detailed, and large enough to hold without tweezers. Don't waste your money..."
5,Inspirational and simple - a great book,"Joe Pelayo has written an inspirational book drawing on his wealth of experience. His basic philosophy is that if you help others, others will help you. Networking can be simple and it can be satisfying. Joe is living proof that it works. I can recommend his book to literally everyone. You will not be sorry to have bought this book."
4,Great country Album,"I bought this Album after listening to ""Trampoline"" and although initially being somewhat dissapointed it has grown on me and is a Brilliant recordIt is alternative Country at it's best and stands up well to the test of time just don't buy it on the strenght of Scar, Trampoline and Fuse his more recent Albums as this is quite different"
3,'Country Joe' Henry?,"Let it be known, I'm crazy about Joe Henry. I can't say enough good things about the way he writes and sings. I can't think of anyone who gets under your skin the way he does and stays there, burning slowly. So, what is it about this album that doesn't affect me the same way that most of his work does? The writing is terrific and his singing doesn't fail. I think it's the music. The band behind him, The Jayhawks, very accomplished and critically acclaimed musicians bring their fiddle/mandolin bluegrass overtones to a singer/songwriter who is not an artist in this medium and it has left me wanting to hear more of what Joe Henry has evolved into since working with T-bone Burnett on Shuffletown and also his later stuff, Trampoline and Fuse. I know there will be those that disagree and think I'm missing something 'essential' in this cd, but, this one's not near the top of my list."
5,Buy It! Now!,"This is the first concert dvd I have purchased, and all I can say is ""wow""! The energy in the concert part made me feel like I was right there at the show. And if that weren't enough, the band lets the cameras follow them everywhere for a behind the scenes look at who Sister Hazel is. I have never laughed so hard at a bunch of fun-loving guys touring the country and sharing their views on everything from truck stops to poop to the best way to pack a suitcase. The concert rocks, the fun rolls, and you would be crazy to pass up this dvd!"
5,ALL are right,"All 4 of the customer reviews, of Vol. 3, are very right. The REAL ""trick"", though, is to try to find the other Volumes of the EMI, total reissue. Sometimes some of the other Volumes are available from classical sellers/auctioneers, such as Lawrence Jones/Polyphony, and others. In any case, this is one of the penultimate collections of the great EMI archives, and unmatchable .. anywhere else."
5,great for touching up silver,"These are great for a quick and easy touch up, without trashing your sink and countertops with a full-blown polishing. Be sure to order enough stuff so shipping is fee. That really makes this a great value."
5,keeps your hands clean as you polish silver,much easier to use than bottle. I get around 6 months of cleaning with these gloves. would reccomend them .
3,Skin Whitener,"Did not whiten my skin to the degree I wanted, but did make it a few shades lighter. Its ok"
2,Doesn't work,"I have used this for eight months and can tell very little improvement in my skin.it should not that take long or longer for a product to work. If you can't make a product thar works,don,t lie about iand quit selling bad products."
5,"Love it, Works Fast!","Age: 19Skin Tone: DarkEthnicity: African American/My mother used this product to get rid of her dark spots and it worked really well. So I began using it three days ago, and I am already seeing a big difference. My skin looks a lot brighter, and a lot more even. I am also noticing that my dark acne marks are fading quite nicely. I would recommend that you do not use any other moisturizer with this product because it is greasy. Use it after you wash your face, and PLEASE (do not wear it outside) the sun will darken your skin's pigment with this product if worn outside. So, use it at night, or just inside your home. PLEASE, wear sunscreen while using this product! If, you do not you might be disappointed with your results. This is not for everyone, but it works very well for me."
3,Mehh,"I bought this almost a year ago and although it works, it has a very horrible odor and its to greasy for me."
3,Still waiting,Im not sure if this is working. ive been using it morning and night for the past few weeks. Im trying to just be patient. I use it for dark marks on my body.
2,Good Price but not effective on age spots & caused blemishes,"I've tried this product repeatedly for several times consistently each time; and each time, the reaction was no reduction in age spots - or whatever they are, I'm in my 50's so a little early for dark age spots - but it never lightened them - and instead started blemishes (yuck on a middle age lady!) Looking for something else now :)"
5,love it,i love this product just start using it and i see a difference already. its in a cute little thing u can carry around in your purse.
2,sucks,Got darker on my face!.. I've been using it for 4weeks and the spots on my cheeks havnt gotten lighter.
3,Haven't seen results,I will have to continue using it since I haven't noticed any results in my skin. I like the fact that it hasn't burnt my skin like other products have.
1,I just did not like the texture!,"I have had this product for some time now. Unfortunately I just cannot use it. The texture makes it difficult to apply and once you apply it to your skin, it leaves a vaseline type feel. I tried using it in the morning but couldn't apply make up or put on clothing right away. I also tried using it at night but woke with gross vaseline like smears on sheets (really nasty). I really wanted this to work but the texture makes it difficult."
1,What a bummer...,"I've been using this whitener everyday since early February and have seen absolutely no positive results. I have compared my before pictures with current pictures and there is literally no change. The only thing I like is that it is very moisturizing, however, the consisteny is like smearing chapstick on your face. Once you scrape it out of the container you will need to cream-it-up by rubbing it in your hand before it is smooth enough to apply. (Not quite sure this is something for those who break-out easily or have acne.) Will be trying something new..."
5,The Best,"I've used this cream for years and it works wonders! I get random bug bites on my legs and if they turn dark after healing, I use this cream and with daily use, its gone. This cream never lets me down."
2,Not sure didn't use all the time,Never really used it honestly!!! I maybe used it a couple of times but not enough to actually see a difference! I know you have to keep up on it so you can see resutls but haven't had the chance lol! But that does not mean it doesn't work!
3,Do not notice much difference,"i had slight skin discoloration which i could get rid off, but overall, this did not help lighten my complexion at all."
4,Something of Myself- Review,Pretty good book with the best facts on Kipling's life I can find so far. Has quite a bit of information on rather obscure parts of his life and his personal life. I found this book very useful in writing a reasearch report on Kipling's life.
3,Quite disappointed,"I'd say my disappointment in this game has more to do with my lack of patience than anything. I just don't think a game should have a several hour learning curve. The training and tutorial modes are good enough to get you up and running but there's no way you could just pick up this game for the first time having little or no experiance with MC racer games and do well.The bikes are okay, the tracks are okay. Graphics are okay.Makes me really miss the Panasonic 3DO. (Age specific joke there)If you really want this game, I mean you REALLY want this game, go for it. But if you're on the fence, just rent it. It's worth a try, but I'll be trading it in."
4,Worth the Money,"This is a great DVD to have! Us North Americans have been waiting for this DVD to come out for a while. It's worth the money, however, the video quality is only DVD5 and is watchable, but pixelates sometimes. It only comes equipped with Dolby Surround (2 Channel, not 5.1). Other than that, the concert is great, and though Lorie lip syncs, she's so visually entertaining you forget about the lip syncing. However, for only a few dollars more I'd reccomend buying the 'Coffret' because it has this live DVD plus two more. A better value, but this is still a great buy overall."
3,Not for the Beginner...,"I bought this for my [...]based on all the great reviews and discovered that it is for intermediate to advanced players. The drill discussions are super short and fast and way too advanced for beginners with little or no instruction or footage on technigues.I was disappointed and am looking for a thorough dvd that discusses and shows the fundamentals. If you start wrong, you finish poorly. Fundamental techniques should be the starting point for beginning soccer players."
5,FOR INTERMEDIATE TO ADVANCED... NOT FOR BEGINNERS.,"In one word ""awesome"". I am the director of an academy. We have players from 5 yrs. to 20 yrs. old, and I suggested this DVD to all of my coaches. Unfortunately, I have bought other soccer DVD from ""famous"" soccer players and just wasted my time and money. But this DVD is full of numerous soccer drills and meaningful insights and not useless talk. I would highly recommend this DVD to coaches for children 8 and up to adults. Many of these drills can be adapted to meet the specific needs of the children or older players. I have taken one skill from the video and modified it into over 10 different skills. Great buy, a must have!!!"
3,Great for new coaches,"Found this DVD to be more for a beginner to intermedite level coach. Drills are common with most soccer video's. If your new to coaching and want a few ideas, it does offer a few good drills. Did not find it benefical with anything unique to develope championship teams."
4,Championship Soccer Drills,We enjoyed watching the dvd with our son who is a novice. It was helpful to us in getting a better understanding of the game. He started with an U9 team who had been together for about 3 years and he missed a lot of the fundamentals which were taught to the others in the earlier years. This helped to bridge the gap for him.
4,One Of The Better Soccer DVDs I've Seen!,I've looked at between 5-7 soccer instructional DVDs and thisranks as one of the top. It flows very well and the drills work.It lacks ever so slightly in technique butdon't let that influence your decision to obtain it.The merits out weigh anything negative.I counted about 52 team drills out of whichour team has tried about 35-40. This program would be anexcellent resource for almost any youth soccer league. School coaches as wellas municipal Parks & Recreation Departments will also benefit.I have no reservation recommending CHAMPIONSHIP SOCCER DRILLS!Soccer Coaching: Schupak's Soccer 6 Pack DVD SetThis popular soccer DVD set by Marty Schupak also includes this title.
5,Fun & Skils For All Soccer Players! A Must Have For Parents!,"This soccer DVD stands alone as far as quality drills, improved skills and fun.The production values are clear with crisp transition from drill to drill.Excellent explanations are given with the narration. Like anything else in life, you will getout of this DVD what you put in. When you play it, have the remote and a legal pad handy.Take notes. List the drills you think are appropriate for your team.Then practice, practice and more practice. This program works.Our practices were more stimulating. Our players got better. Our team had more funMake no mistake, if you want to buy one soccer DVD,CHAMPIONSHIP SOCCER DRILLS is the one to have."
2,Disappointing after his first book,"Not much to say, I love the guy, I love his attitude but he said it all in the first book and this was really disappointing - much ado about nothing. STick to I Feel Great and You Will Too and its good but not this one."
4,Difficult to read the time,"I've only had the watch for a couple months now, but I did notice that the time is difficult to read because the crystal gives off too much of a glare and there is no contrasting colors or shades to make the hands of the dial stand out (the face of the dial is not even luminescent, so forget about seeing it in the dark). I also had to have two of the links taken out for proper fit. But it is a handsome watch that goes with just about everything, and as soon as you put it on you know it's a high quality, well-made watch, which is typical of Seiko watches. And for the extremely discounted price I paid for this watch, I guess I shouldn't complain too much."
2,Genuine Seiko Watch?,"Timely receipt of item shipped fr Luzy's Storage Place, Lexington, KY. Eagerly THOUGH Disappointed when I opened the package. ONLY a Seiko Watch was in a blue box BUT there were NO Instruction Booklet Nor Any Warranty Booklet/Card! All of my many watch purchases, in stores or online, came nicely and completely packaged with mfr instruction booklet, warranty booklet and card - Seiko, Citizen, Tissot, Tag Heuer, Bulova, etc. Now I am not sure if this is Genuine Seiko?"
5,The Promise which Delivers,"Richards has written an outstanding book! He goes into great detail,increidibley interesting, about the origins of those who believe in a secret rapture of Christians. The authors of the best-selling series of books, Left Behind,took many of their ideas from the person of whom Richards writes, Lewis Sperry Chafer. This fascinating book is a must read for anyone who has an interest, passing or intense, in the subject of religion."
1,Don't Buy This Product,"Video Tape recording quality poor and sometimes wouldn't record at all even after cleaning the heads and buying new tapes. Warranty is useless.Remote is poorly designed. Also, you cannot use the numeric keypad to set the time when you want to record.Switched to the Panasonic DVD Recorder with an 80 GB hard drive and will never go back to tape."
3,Sony Should Sit Up and Take Notice,"I returned the SONY DVD/VHS combo: because it does not allow for internal recording from DVD (non-copyrighted) to VHS. I wanted to copy some home made DVD-R to VHS for friends who don't have a DVD player.So I bought this one. Someone complained of the remote control layout: I found it very easy to use.The quality of VHS playback is very good.All functions work well.Now perhaps someone can tell me, why I need to connect with components out (another expensive piece of cable) to obtain progressive scan picture?Overall a sound investment"
5,Through a Chinese Glass Darkly,"Bravo, an impulse purchase of this book was amply rewarded by elegant ghost stories that delighted me no end. This is a book to keep and treasure. At times the pathos is mingled with humor reminding one of the best of Hans Andersen's fairy tales. The supernatural is interwoven with much of the natural world and the symbiotic relations between humans and nature create that ""bardo"" between worlds in which anything can happen. The ""Fisherman's Tale"" is perhaps my favorite in the collection, it is a thoughtful & chilling meditation on life and death. This small collection has sent me on a journey to read all of Mr. Kwan's work."
5,Magical Chinese tales for everyone,"Don't worry if you don't know about China or its history: just sit around the campfire and take a journey through strange ghost stories from another land. Unlike many awkward translations, Michael David Kwan freely retells these stories with a formidably poetic writing style, painting pictures in the mind as vivid as those that fixated him as a child on the street corners of China. Hidden throughout is a wealth of insight into the daily life and values that shaped the culture of Imperial China."
4,"Delightful, not what I expected","At first I was dissappointed that this CD set did not contain the complete score of Die Dreigroschenoper, but the ambiance, the authenticity, and even the mild hiss, gave me the feeling that I was truly back in 1920s Berlin (not that I was ever there!). Many of the songs are repeated once and sometimes twice with different artists, but this too shows the brilliance of the music. Delightful disk! (Of course I'm once again looking for a good complete score...)"
2,Didn't take you far enough to be helpful,"The basis of this book is to help kids WHO CARE ABOUT THEIR GRADES to get organized. The only ""threat"" to kids was ""if you don't do this, you won't get a good grade"". He gave examples of his own children who got very upset at the prospect of a bad grade on a project or paper. The problem at my house was a son who didn't care if he got good grades or not, so this book was no help. After reading several books on this subject, the one I choose to follow was Homework without Tears by Lee Canter. His book told you what to do when they don't care about their grades, ""lost"" or ""forgot"" their homework or claimed all semester that everything was done and you only find out differently when the report card comes with a horrible grade."
4,Covers More than Homework,"This book was extremely helpful in working with my 9-year-old. Rather than just tips and tricks for homework hassles with your kid, this book teaches PARENTS how to better guide their children so - methodically in turn - children magically start accepting their responsibilities, which in the end prepares them for responsible adulthood. The more you hound, the more you ""hover,"" the more you check on them, the more you worry for them, the less they do themselves, which progressively makes them more dependent on you and less on themselves. This theory took me by surprise, as I wanted to be extremely involved with my child's work in school. But I had no idea I was actually hindering her growth and understanding of responsibility and accountability. The book also offers help for parents and children with consistent homework problems, attitudes and resistance. Excellent and easy-to-read."
5,A must have if battling with homework!,This was an easy read and had alot of practical tips on how to stop battling with your child everynight with homework. Would highly recommend to those partent.
4,Homework Hassles,This book has some good ideas for parents of how they can help their child become more responsible for his/her homework. Some information about medications and classroom interventions is outdated but the book has a lot to offer if you keep in mind the date of publication.
5,Good product with good results,Works great and fits great. Should be used in combination with some type of bacteriostatic.
2,Product gets cheaper each year,"I have two Bemis humidifiers that use the 1040 replacement. I believe Essick bought Bemis at some point. The items fits the unit as it is the one sold for the unit. The big issue is the the wick element is ""supposed"" to be glued to the plastic frame.Over the last couple of years (I replace the a couple of times over the winter) the company has used less and less glue and as soon as the wick gets wet it starts to fall out of the frame. I have fixed this by holding it in the frame with rubber bands. It gets the job done but should I be using rubber bands to hold together the product!! Very poor quality.I have e-mailed the company and they never responded.When the units finally die I will be getting a different brand."
2,Menards is cheaper and better quality,"I bought a few pair of these here and noticed the wick is not really adhered properly to the frame. When I used them up I went to Menards and noticed first that Menards sells them for over $5 a pair cheaper. I bought a couple pair and when I got home, noticed that not only are the same wicks from Menards almost half price, but also better quality. The wicks were glued in properly and seem to last much longer than the ones I bought here on Amazon!"
2,Essic Air 1040 Replacement wick.,I was not happy with the performance of thesesfilters. Did not last long and 1 actually came apart after a few months use.
3,Essick Replacement Wicks,Standard part for humidifier. Should be changed every year. I bought a couple of them to ensure I don't miss out in case the company discontinues manufacture.
4,SO FAR SO GOOD,I am not the one using this but my husband and son seem very pleased with it so far. Time will tell on how well the filters work and how economical they turn out to be.
1,Not the book you want for decorating ideas,I ordered this in hopes of finding inspiring pictures for decorating our nursery. The pictures seemed dated. I wouldn't recommend.
5,Baby room ideas.,My daughter loved this book and it will go around to friends & family when they are in need of some ideas or pointers.
4,meditation,"These cards are in a case small enough to set up on my desk so I can look at the inspirational words at a glance many times during the day. They make it easy to bring Mother Teresa's simply stated, profound, and comforting words into a stressful day. They keep me centered and more mindful of others."
4,"Not for me at this time in my life, maybe later...",If something takes assembly every time I use it I am just not going to gravitate to it. I have a 3 and 6 year old so I have to put this up every time I use it for fear that it will get wrapped around someone's neck. My television is not near a doorknob so I had to contort into some really interesting positions the first time I used this thing. I was thinking that maybe I should market my own workout DVD as I did feel better in the end. I think that overall it seems to be of ok quality and I will continue to pull it out to give it a solid go but I don't see it in my regular weekly routine in the future.
3,accelerator broke,"I loved this video/weighted bar pilates workout, until 2 weeks into my working out, the accelerator bar broke. One of the male ends broke off in the female end, and I cannot get it out. Now I cannot do most of the workouts with the bar. I am 5'4"" and 135 pounds, and fairly new to working out. I do not think I have super-human strength that could break the bar unless it is a piece of crap. I may just buck up and buy a new kit, because I really liked the results I was seeing in just 2 weeks."
4,Good Kit,Good kit unfortunately I did not have the results I expected but I still use it as a good workout!
2,Packaging is less than desirable,"My wife ordered the Pilates set and was very excited when it was received. I opened the Amazon shipping box expecting to find the Pilates package. To my dismay everything was loose in the Amazon box, and believe it or not there is some assembly required however no instructions so I was left to my own devices. Personally as a big guy 290 -6'3"" I am afraid to give it a try as the elastic part looks flimsy. However my wife who this was meant for is 5'6"" and 120pds and she seems to have no problem doing the workouts and since she is who these exerises tend to be made for it works great for her. There are two dvds and she has cranked out the routines with very little difficulty."
1,other equipment better,"I purchased this kit from Amazon.I have found it to be the least useful of the Pilates equipment I have. The assembly is totally annoying.I guess the exercises are OK, but I did them only once because of the annoying need to put the parts together.When I checked out the website, it was one those infomercials that have a quality of complete exaggeration and fakery about them. If I had known it was an infomercial type hyped-up product, I would have never ordered it.It's just not for me."
4,Good cross training,"Easy to use and a pretty good workout.I do a lot of cardio and I found these are a great addition to my workout routine. I was expecting the workouts to be really simple, but they can actually give you a real workout! I like these a lot!The kit does have a lot of pieces so you'll have to find a dedicated spot for them, or put them in a box to keep it all together. Some assembly required EVERY TIME you decide to do a different workout because each piece is for a different workout. It can be a little annoying.Also this thing is black and red velvet and looks like it belongs under the bed. I'm just sayin'"
2,Not a happy customer,I ordered this product and set myself on a strict 1400 calorie diet plus did not skip a single workout. In the first week I did lose two pounds but no inches. I'm into my second week and I'm supposed to believe I'll just magically lose the 10 inches. I don't think a product should be able to make these claims if it is not possible.
2,ehh,so shipping time was really great as far as product...when i opened the package it came in there was a huge dent in the top of the polish..almost looked like it was melted by a curling iron...i brushed it off thinking things happen and im not too interested in what the top looks like..but when i went to use it the bottle was SO hard to open and when i finally got it open the polish was suuuper runny..took like 4-5 coats till it was actually white and by the time i got it white it was kinda clumpy and took forever to dry due to how many coats i had to use..dont know if its the sellers fault or just the product itself. im rarely disappointed by OPI so...idk..
3,Re: OPI Hawiian Orchid polish,"The quality of the product in not the issue for me, it was the shade of the color. On my monitor it appears to be slightly more intense. Just too pale for my skin tone."
5,Great polish and great service,"OPI Femme De Cirque - in the Spot-light PinkSold by: BEAUTYLAND4UNail polish was exactly what I wanted. It arrived quickly and in perfect shape. I just read some other reviews about the color, so feel I need to add that the color is exactly what I wanted."
3,secret shimmer,"i looked at several photos of this polish applied to nails before purchasing it online but wasnt able to see that it has a very fine shimmer to it. im not a shimmer fan. i ended up ordering ""in the spot-light pink""...pretty close match without the glitter."
5,Perfect Shade of Pink,I have been searching for the perfect shade of light pink for my nails. This is it. It is not too bold or too pale. It is perfect. I love OPI.
2,OPI: Bubble Bath - BLAND dirty bath water?,"Ok, so there are apparently two shades with the same name:*One is (theoretically) a sheer pale pink that is said to be pretty. Sadly, that's not what this is.*The other is a beige-pink sheer shade, which I thought it would be an ok consolation prize.I was SO wrong. This was unoriginal, blah, milky, sorta-nude. HIGHLY disappointing. There may be folk who like this, but I'm not one of them. Coverage is average for a sheer, prone to streaking. It doesn't chip too quickly.But if you really /must/ have such a meh nude tone? You can get roughly the same color with Sally Hansen's ""Shall We Dance?""[That's in their ""Complete Salon Manicure"" line. Oddly, it's LEAGUES better. I never thought to see it outperform OPI, but it certainly did in this case. Everything from the brush to the coverage to the lasting power. Go figure.]Seriously, ditch Bubble Bath and just buy that instead."
3,Use as a Topcoat,"This nail polish looked different in the picture online that I saw. I thought it would be a nice, shimmery nude color, however, you may as well not even paint your nails. It is basically like putting on a topcoat and that's it. I couldn't even tell my nails were painted. I would definitely only use this as a topcoat. It wasn't even that shiny though. I love OPI, but I would pass on this one and go for something else."
1,Cracks and chips Immediately,"Though the tiny glitter color spectrum is beautiful, the polish itself if horrible. It doesn't matter how I put the polish on (with a base coat/no base coat/ top coat/no top coat, 1 coat of the I Juggle Men color or 5 coats of the color) it Immediately chips the next day. It first spider webs--looks all cracked but is smooth, then shortly after it just starts to flake off on its own. I have tried it several times, several different way since I have receive the product, and without fail, the next day it spider webs and flakes off. I was thoroughly disappointed that I spent almost $8 for a nail polish that does that."
2,"More like a clear polish than a ""cotton candy"" color","Was recommended to me through an Internet site as I was looking for neutral nail polish colors for pale skin. It looked like a light pink and I decided to buy it. Was very disappointed when it came and I tried it on. Even with several layers the color didn't impress me. I've used it as a clear polish to go on top of other polishes and it works well that way, but on its own I am not a fan."
3,Too sheer,I was looking for something sheer and classy. I like the color but its a little too sheer. Need about 3+ coats.
4,"OPI nail polish ""Its a Girl""",The product was great and made a great party favor for a baby shower. I ordered 30 bottles of polish from one company and was very disappointed to receive a $60 shipping and handling fee from the company.
3,Not for warm skin tones,"I bought this because I thought it would be good nail coverage that was neutral in color and also professional. Professional maybe, but neutral it is not. Tickle My France-y might be the best neutral nude from OPI. My undertone is warm, and this color looks so blah on my hands. It looks darker on the nail than it does in the picture."
3,It's okay,"This was a great transaction/seller. Great price and shipped quickly. The color was not what I thought it would be. It comes across much differently on the monitor, pale soft pink. When I received it the color was more of a shiny salmon. Not what I was hoping for but still a good product."
3,good top coat,I thought this would actually be a nail color and instead it was a clear glitter polish. It is good as a shimmer coat to another nail polish. I purchased OPI's So many clowns...so little time with this and it adds a nice shimmer to a neutral polish. If I would have known I would have purchased another color in their Femme De Cirque line.
3,"clear , not as pictured","this in the spotlight pink is pictured a very pink color. but it is a very very sheer barely pink. its more like a clear topcoat. i brushed on 4 coats before it looked a very pale hint of pink shade. i usually dont like to use more than 2 coats because the polish doesnt seem to last as long before it begins to chip up off the edges, the thicker the polish the more easily it peels up or chips,... so i only gave this a 3 star rating. but with the 4 coats it is a nice barely subtle pink, for a casual clean look. just like a shiny topcoat really."
3,OPI nail polish,"I like OPI but this color is just way to sheer for me, I will pass it along to my grand daughter."
5,pretty color,The color of OPI cotton candy is nearly colorless but bright.It's very nature and applicable to a variety of occasions. I always use it in my office but not so publicity
2,OPI Nail varnish - Bubble Bath,"I love OPI Nail polish, a fabulous thick application brush makes putting it on a breeze. I did not however like the color 'Bubble Bath' - compared to OPI's bolder colors the Bubble Bath went on streaky and patchy. I can only find satisfaction when only applying one coat, once I put two coats on it looks bad."
4,What I expected,"I love all OPI nail polish so it's what I was expecting....although I didn't think it would be as think as it is. I would recommend buying anything from OPI great products!OPI Nail Lacquer, Alpine Snow, 0.5 Ounce"
3,Far too sheer to be true to color.,"See that Cotton Candy Pink color in the photos? There is no way you will see that on your nails unless you apply several coats of this polish. It is extremely sheer, and in fact, would be hard to differentiate from a clear top coat if applied in a single coat.As with any polish, multiple coats will result in increased opacity. But that also increases the gummy/gunky surface factor, not to mention the wasted time and product use involved.Not that there's anything wrong with this nail polish. But as other reviewers have said, it is very sheer--nude, in fact. If it were marketed as such, I would have no problem giving 5 stars. As it is, 3 stars is the best I can offer."
4,Streaky brush!!,"nice alternative to Essie mademoiselle, but goes on streaky. Used Essie brush instead, which made a big difference in the polish applying more evenly."
5,Love the color,"It's such a pretty and yet natural color! I rarely wear nail polish because my experience has always been seeing colors that are too glossy or heavy and artificial that it's not worth the trouble of applying them and then cleaing them off a few days later when it starts peeling off and looking bad. But since I foound this color (the OPI Bubble Bath), thanks to my sister's recommandation after she got it from a manicure, I want to be wearing it everyday! Now I'm constantly admiring my own nails and excited about the next fresh application!I wear a clear coat of foundation and then applied a light layer of the bubble bath because I like a more opaque look, but if you like the color to be more solid like the one show on the product page you'd have to apply it twice."
3,Color not as pictured,"Beware if you order this. In the picture, the polish appears to be a pretty gray color, but what arrived in the mail today was a light pink! Not at all like what is pictured. I am sure it will be the Opi quality, but definitely not what I thought I was going to get."
2,Not for me.,"I have this on my computer and tried using it once to take notes, and it failed miseralbly. I tried to take notes on a film I was watching for a Phil. class and it was annoying to use. I'm not the type that will take notes with my laptop (since it's not a fancy tabletpc), so I didnt find Onenote useful. I'm sure if I were cutting and pasting notes to prepare quotes for an essay, it would've been easier (and more helpful.)"
2,This is Microsoft?,"OneNote is the weakest Office product Microsoft has ever released. It has minimal features and fails to integrate in any useful way with other Office products. OneNote even fails to read Journal files, which is ridiculous for a TabletPC user. There is great potential for this product, as the basic structure for organizing files is well thought out, but the rest is amateurish at best. Unfortunately, software titles for TabletPC are still rather limited, and this poor product isn't about to woo any new users to the technology."
5,Cant beat free!,"In the fall of 2004 Microsoft had a van located at my school. They were giving out this program, I thought it was just some worthless trial, but no I got the entire program! Im going to be getting a laptop soon, big ups to Microsoft, neener neener neener to you for paying! neener neener neener (hey whys it asking if Im over the age of 13)?"
1,Couldn't get it to work at all,I downloaded the trial version. The features look great but I couldn't get the program to work. It wouldn't even let me type anything on the page.
1,Its just WORD!!!,"This is the biggest waste of money in the world! It is just a word program that saves it in a directory. Use Microsoft Word, and save in special folders, and save the money. Shame on you Microsoft for taking advantage of your customer base."
1,so so quality but very bad service,"I bought one , but it is not convinient for those that with the touch pad, it is hard to write unless you have pen.also I bought hope there will be a rebate, but they said the coupon must be original, but they did not send me the one, which means they give you better hope but not real result.that is bad feeling!!! very bad!! since then I will never buy one microsoft product privately."
4,Good in a weak category,"I have long been searching for a good digital notebook. I think this does that basic job. It's pretty to easy to store your thought in a hierarchical structure. It's pretty easy to transfer copies of your work from other application in either text format or otherwise. Bottom line, it's a good recorder. My criticism isn't it doesn't help your organize or structure your work. It's a quality recorder of, but not a great enhancer of, your thought process."
2,OneNote,Not generally worth it. Too much effort to integrate into daily routine for it to be worth it...
4,Great for students!,"This program replaces the need for a notebook. I keep all my notes in there and its easy to search for particular notes.Also keeps everything organized.Great software, I recommend it highly!"
4,Everyone need,"Easy to use, Understand the menu feature. Easy to take and send to email to store. Thia is very useful."
3,Uneven,"I had a hard time reading this book -- there were parts of it that I found lyrical & compelling (like the introduction, and many of the chapters narrated by toko) and parts that seemed very heavy-handed (especially the telling of the history of protests over land that had been claimed by the gov't during wartime and the chapters narrated by hemi). Especially early in the book I found it easy to set it aside for periods of time, but I got more engaged as I got to the second section.One major weakness is that there's no glossary or translation of any of the Maori terms, so it's a much more difficult read for someone who is trying to become more familiar with the people and culture than someone who already is."
3,great condition,"Even though I didn't get it within the time period, the book was practically brand new."
2,quick plotted sequel,Plot twist piled on plot twist in a fast paced continutation of precursor's plot and protagonist with little or no rehash. Cinematic heroism with villains at every turn and steadily timed Hamlet style self doubt. Not a great work of art by any means but a mercifully short and confidently written spin down the well worn lane of space opera. A few brief interesting memes regarding self image of clones as thralls in advanced society.
3,"Good value, so so presentation","For the price paid, this was a decent book. It was an ok introduction to Innes. However, the images were usually quite a bit less than full page, and too dark. The text was pretty short and there weren't very many images. This book only scraped the surface of Innes very prolific career.I would recommend this book as an inexpensive introduction to Innes, not as a resource book."
5,Wonderful American artist,George Inness was a wonderful American artist. He had a special talent for working with greens. The photos of his paintings are beautiful. I also liked the description written about each painting. Well worth the money. I can spend much time looking at the photos of his paintings.
1,Before of region classification,Hard to know if this is a good movie or not since I failed to note the Region 2 (actually I was unaware at the time of the different region classifications for dvd's). It won't pay in Region 1 which is USA.
2,Truly dreadful -give me VOLCANO any day.,"A cheapjack rip-off of DANTE's PEAK. A mountain town is threatened by a volcano, which consumes two young lovers at the start(so did PEAK!), and lo and behold, the townspeople do not believe the volcanologist who constantly warns everyone to evacuate. When the lava flows, it looks more like Heinz Tomato Soup! The effects are not awful enough to be cheesy! They are just simply laughable. And how do they save the town? see for yourself . . . and it had me thinking 'oh do me a favour.' Even SOUTH PARK has more realism than this low-grade turkey."
3,Great but No Refills for the Pen,"I purchased this pen in order to have a laser/writing instrument in one unit. The laser works well and the batteries are available almost everywhere. However the pen ran out of ink shortly after purchase and I cannot find a suitable refill anywhere. I hate carrying around equipment that is partially operational. It should ALL work ALL OF THE TIME.Also, the center of the barrel does not remain closed but unscrews and requires constant re-closing. I own other lasers/laser pens and the refill issue aside, this one looks good, feels good and the laser and flashlight work well"
1,Not an effective pen,If you are looking to buy a pen then this is not the right product for you because the ink is not refillable. The ink runs out very quickly making the pen useless and thus the tool being good for only the laser and flashlight.
3,"Not so much Septic, but good","When i first heard this album, i thought i was about to cry. What happend to this once so great band, the band who opend my eyes for Death metal? The second time i listend to it, i heard some small, desperat sounds behind all it that was trying to reach out and touch me. I traind my ears, and then i heard it. Septic flesh. This is a good album, but i dont know who is responsible for the ""synt-goth"" style that is on this record. I blame the new guy. If you want to hear the real septic flesh, try ""mystic places of dawn"" or ""Orphidian weel"". There is the true septic flesh."
1,toner all over,Don't purchase unless you like toner all over the cartridge. When you open the black plastic the whole cartridge is covered with toner. Yes it does have the tape attahced.
2,Questions,"The price is good on this, but I see that the Product Description says:""Discontinued by manufacturer: Yes"", and that makes me wonder about the age of this item, b/c they do have a shelf life. Also not sure if this is a new or re-filled cartridge, and if there is a guarantee. I am reluctant to buy without more information, plus at this time there are no reviews.Anybody have info?"
4,"What Works ""Works""!","With business people today spending an average of 30% of their work time writing, this book offers simple techniques (along with practice situations) to make your message more clear and powerful. This book was helpful to me because most writing skills taught in business schools today are not comparable to the writing demands faced by these same students in the business world. This book also helped me discard my academic view that writing features lengthy paragraphs and big words and taught me to use concise paragraphs to get the job done. Look at me now! This review was originally five pages!"
5,Awesome!,"Excellent card for workstation, superpc, i have the last pci video card installed + last xeon for it 3.2ghz and 3gb ram and it can move starcraft 2 excellent. The more cheap superpc."
1,Disappointed,I received the product. I was very excited. I'm a computer expert. I connected everything according to instructions. It never started up instead it smoked. Now I'm not sure about the quality of the product I received. This is the very first time this has happened to me that a motherboard smoked to the point that smoke filled the room.
1,Have to be a Huge Fan- Save Your Money,"My 11 year old daughter wanted this Album to hold her Wacky Stickers. It arrived quickly, the seller was prompt and problem free. However, this item looks like a free giveaway except that you have to pay $7.95 for it. There was one ""bonus"" sticker inside.Awful and cheap. We were both dissapointed in it."
3,Small in size and Can't add additional pages,"This product is cute but I assumed it was a ""binder"" so I could add more pages, if needed but it is not. It holds cards but you are unable to add additional pages. Also, it is very small in size. I guess I was assuming it was a standard binder size. I don't have it in front of me while writing this review but it is approximately 9""x6"". Also, I was disappointed with the shipping charges - I bought two - they put 2 in one envelope yet charged me entire shipping for 2 which I think was $5 x 2 = $10 when it only cost them a fraction of that to actually send. Still cute and durable and fun!"
4,"Great, But Where's ""ROTJ""?","Why didn't this volume include the adaptation of ""Return Of The Jedi""? I thought this 7-voulume set collected the ENTIRE Marvel run! I know ""Jedi"" was released as a separate four-issue series, but I would have like to have seen what it looked like before Dark Horse re-colored it.Other than that, volume 5 is great, and has characters like Fenn Shysa, Tobbi Dala, and Zeltrons who have survived to the modern day."
5,Good Introduction to the Topic,"This book serves as an excellent introduction to the battle of Marathon and the events leading up to it. First off, it should be noted that this is a popular history book. Therefore the depth that it goes into is rather limited. If you're looking for a detailed study of the battle then this book is going to be a massive disappointment for you. Most of the book is taken up with the events leading up to the battle. The battle itself only covers the last 15-20 pages. The first section is on the Ancient Greeks (Specifically the Athenians), the second covers the Persians, and the third covers the immediate prelude to the war. It covers all the main characters and establishes the cultures and societies that are clashing with a great deal of insight. The writing style in this book makes it a pleasure to read, and it would undoubtedly be an excellent book for people new to this time period. My biggest problem with this book is that it isn't longer."
3,intermediate,This ia a good intermediate instrument for use by a young student until he is sure he is dedicated to music. i bought it for my grandson.
4,Good starter,"The guitar is a good quality and has a nice sound/tone. The color of the picture is a bit misleading, the guitar came and it is actually orange in color.We were wanting a more blond wood as the picture shows, but a nice item for our daughter to start out with.Also bought a strap for this and it does not have the pegs on it to attach the strap, so we have to go get those mounted."
4,Revelation,"Cds like this one shouldn't take the place of cds like limp, but make you realize that the bizkit is a catchy band they just can't stand up against some damn good FUNK. And that seems to be what H.S.J. is all about."
5,Masterful and moving.,Here's a score I found almost by accident. I havent seen the movie yet but this thing still moves me like no score has in along time. A very flavorful and varied musical pallette. I cant wait to see the movie!
3,An award winner,"Yes, this book was an ""also ran"" and probably well deserved. I found it tedious. Tales of exceptional people, however wonderful they may be, only end up making you feel like a loser!! Sorry, but I couldn't get into it."
4,College student,"A small sleepy little town called Red Mud Flats experienced heavy rains. This was believed to have caused the kudzu to grow at an amazing rate. Bobby Lee, a young boy from the town volunteered to find a woman named Kudzu Katie to help find a solution for their green foliage problem. Katie suggested the use of the plant to make furniture, baskets, rugs, and food. Mud Flats became famous for its crafts. Kudzu turned out to be a blessing to the little town.I enjoyed this book. I am writing a research paper on kudzu, and I found this children's book from that research. The uses that the character Katie suggested are real world examples of the uses for today. A teacher could use this book to discuss the introduction of foreign plants into the United States. The illustrations were very green!"
5,Kudzu Chaos,"I thoroughly enjoyed Kudzu Chaos. The book deals with how to turn a negative situation into a positive one, which I think is something more children's books should address. My child and I found it to be very entertaining and inspiring. The book was very well written, creative, and beautifully illustrated. As a southerner, I found the story unique in that the author wrote a children's book about this plant that is such a large part of the south. We look forward to Ms. Lambe's future books!!"
3,Complicated and Tragic,"My book club just reviewed this book and we all agreed that it is a complicated read. The continuous flashbacks make it a bit difficult to follow, especially in the beginning. But perserverance pays off as it picks up the pace in the later chapters. She finds a way to bring together all the characters and their tragic stories. She does a good job in describing urban scenes and I liked the fact that all her characters had names, even the minor ones. I would be interested in finding out what Japanese, Chinese and Vietnamese readers think about her treatment of their culture. I felt that some of the female characters were somewhat stereotypical."
1,I can't recommend this book,"I refer all of you to the review marked ""Yawn"" below, as the review is dead on. I read this book on the advice of an excellent review in the NYTIMES. I was mislead. The characters lacked substance and depth, and the sex scenes seemed to be thrown in for no apparent reason. It's a shame, too, because somewhere in here there could have been an interesting novel.... I wish I had passed on this one."
1,Not worth your time!,"I picked up this novel as I was attracted by its cover and the very promising explanation of the meaning of Yobai(crawling at night). After I had read through the authors introduction I started the book. From the beginning the novel lacked substance and the promised pros and lyrical style. At one point I asked myself if the author intended to fit every scene of her past life into the book - from catering, to living in a trailer, to chef at a Japanese restaurant-. Definitely not a book that I would recommend - just not worth it. This is in fact the first book that I every picked-up and thought it had wasted my time..."
1,Yawn.,"Badly written work masquerading as transgressive literary fiction. Bears the Mary Gaitskill seal of approval, always a bad sign. Features menus as chapter headings, another bad sign. Ends abruptly indicating the writer lost interest, a good sign. I lost interest, too, but sooner than the writer. Brevity works to the book's advantage, though. Yeah, it's still a yawn and a waste of time, but at least this careless tome can be read in the hour it takes to watch a piglet battle on Iron Chef. But...kudos bars and breakfast at Nobu to Evan Gaffney and Robert Maxwell! The cover's the best thing about this book, perhaps the baddest sign of all."
5,A Hidden Gem,"This is one of my favorite CDs. It starts strong and never loses momentum. One great thing about this disk is how the John Strohm compositions, ""Train"" and ""Girl in a Box"", sit in the middle of the album, creating a nice ""interlude"" between Juliana's songs in each half of the CD. What a great one. If you like this, I also highly recommend the follow-up EP, ""Rosy Jack World"""
3,Not useable,"First off, this didn't come with a doll as it's title says. That aside, it was useless, it can't be viewed. The video looks worst than those old 1960s educational videos - static, lines, skipping, totally unwatchable and useless. Too cheap to bother returning it so they got their money and I got screwed.I had this same video years ago when it first came out and, as for the storyline, music, etc., it's great, but this particular company's copies are unviewable therefore useless and, while I would recommend this video, I wouldn't recommend buying from them."
3,"Not a good source for the ""Hetty Winthrop"" theme","If you're a fan of the theme song of the ""Hetty Wainthrop"" detective series on PBS's ""Mystery!"" you might be tempted by the CD cut ""The TV Detectives."" The theme song melody is a small part of this larger work, but the arrangement just doesn't measure up."
4,Good case,My FZ35 fits nicely in this case lens down sitting on top of an extra battery. Very pleased with it. You can remove the shoulder strap and use the camera strap which is very convenient for the way I carry the camera and case. Glad I bought it.
3,"Very good hardware, very poor software","I wish to concur with other reviewers about the HP 5550C scanner. When you get the software to work correctly, the scanner can produce superb scans and the automatic document feeder works almost flawlessly (it occasionally jams, but not very often). But the HP software has been terrible. After a long wait, HP did release a fix so that the scanner does seem to work with Adobe Acrobat with no error messages, but the software still doesn't work completely correctly on multipage scans. I would unhesitatingly recommend the hardware of this scanner; but until HP can produce good software to interface with the scanner, you might want to consider other options."
1,Good Hardware Software Stinks,"The software that comes with this scanner is so bad you will wonder how it was ever shipped. Just awful. I spend four hours at various times trying to get it to run with Paperport. Completely incompatible. All I want is to scan pages into PDFs at 300 dpi in black and white using Paperport. It can not do this simple task. If you use its own software for scanning the results are even worse. If you like talking to tech support in India for hours on end with no resolution, buy this product. Unless you have a relative who works in tech support for HP and you want to talk to him regularly on company time - run away!"
1,ADF has severe problems,"The ADF (Automatic Document Feeder) has severe problems, working only 40% of the time. I would never recommend this product. In the 30 days that I have owned this equipment, HP has sent me four (4) replacement ADF. I have finally reached my limit of frustration and will be returning this poor example of a scanner.The Customer Service people are extremely polite, however, unable to understand the problem presented. I found most of them to be almost incompitent. Additionally, when I was connected with a sales person to help me determine a more reliable scanner that I should purchase, I found that once again, they were unable to respond to the questions presented to them. I was almost wondering if I was speaking a language other than English. I have been very dissapointed with the entire process."
2,outdated and non functional,Was not able to use it with any computer I had at home. Ended up giving it away to a friend who had an obsolete computer it would work with.
5,HP Scanner,Did the job and arrived quickly. I had it for 2 year and fine for Windows based XP system. Will not work on Windows VISTA system.
1,Software won't run with IE7 Installed,"Another bitter customer, I've spent endless hours trying to deal with HP software bugs and now complete failure. Scanner scans well, but the effort required to get the software working is not worth it."
2,Worked well until it died,"I purchased this product and it worked well and was very quite, for about 3 months before it completely died - just stopped working, no fan, no lights, nothing worked one day."
2,Wasted Trees,"Sorry to disappoint the prospective buyer, this book is a waste of your time. It covers Opencms 5.0.? the most recent version of Opencms 6.0? as of today is much different, the API has changed a lot. The book is 262 pages on really bad quality paper and first few chapters are really basic that describe the various UI features in Opencms.Certain chapters like Chapter 5 that describe the Opencms architecture are nothing but list a list of package descriptions and mind you the package names have changed... what a waste ?I rate it at two stars only because there is no other book on Opencms, else I would say it is one star."
3,"Historic performances, poorly engineered sound","This is a great collection of performances, compositions, and violinists. Unfortunately, the sound quality is not good. The engineering has filtered the sound death. Even the more recently recorded tracks with tape sources sound dull and cramped. Also, some tracks have digital pops scattered throughout, which must be in the master stamper or worse because they have occurred on both copies I've heard. Even knowing the poor sound and occasional pops, I reordered this CD after returning the first copy because of the marvelous performances. Other violin compilations with poor over-filtered sound include ""The Great Violinists: Recordings made from 1900-1913"". The Pearl complications, ""The Recorded Violin"" have very good sound as usual from Pearl, but Vol. 2 is not available at this time. ""Eugene Ysaye: Violinist and Conductor"" also has very good sound. By ""very good"" I mean, transmitting fully what is on these mechanically recorded disks."
4,Better than the older Stuntman Game,"This game is a little more forgiving than the first stuntman was on PS-2. For what it does, this game is pretty official. But it's definitely a very linear experience. You always have to learn courses fairly well to succeed, and that involves hitting exact marks, and doing progressively difficult stunts. The overall package delivers, despite the fact that the graphics are slightly cartoony, and remind me a bit of the last generation of systems. Luckily, the mechanics are on point, and the stunts are great."
4,great game if you're not a perfectionist,"This game is really fun. But, it can be frustrating if you keep messing up part (or all) of the scene. Sometimes, it doesn't point out where your mistake lies. You just get one too many ""strikes"". If it replayed your mistake, it would be easier. Maybe just my tv, but; the audio is a little low & muffled. You have to really turn it up or listen because the instructions are also audio to guide you through the scene. There also isn't much variety at first with what is unlocked at the beginning."
3,very challenging,"This is a very challenging game. My eight year old son is much better at it than I, but it's even pretty hard for him. I wish it had some beginner levels for video game amateurs like me so I could work my way up to the more challenging courses. It's pretty good for a game in the $15 price range, though it can be a little frustrating at the same time. The graphics are about a 7 or 8 out of 10. Overall a decent game if you're the patient type."
5,Really good game!,"This is an interesting game. I find it to be one of the better 360 games I own partly because it's different. The idea behind the game is an excellent one and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Going through the levels and pulling off some of these stunts became more and more enjoyable and I found myself totally immersed in the game. Admitingly, it can get a bit monatanous if you are really struggling with a particular stunt but not any worse than any shooter I've ever played. I give it high marks for its graphics, sound, storyline, and unique game experience."
2,Not quite the worst xbox360 game I've ever played.,But it is a runner-up for the title. The game doesnt even live up to its weak premise.Bargain bin junk.
1,No Disc,"I ordered this for my husband for Fathers Day. Upon opening the game today to play it, he discovered there is no disc! Can't play a game without a disc...."
3,god i wish i new how to collapse this thing!!,could be a better construction over all. i just wish i could figure out (with instructions) how to close the stupid thing. its a cool tent though!!!
2,Dull & Uninspired Work played with cool pianism,"I bought this cd excited by ecstatic reviews like ""as if Mahler wrote piano concerto"" or ""super human virtuoso."" It turned out to be a disappointment. The work is one huge mass of uninspired themes and developments. It is an offence to Mahler to compare this dull piece to his great creations.Hamelin's playing has amazing precision and ease, but somehow lacks fire and grandeur of the Russian masters. Critics are lavish in praising Hamelin's 'super-human' technique, but listen to young Rubinstein playing Villa-Lobos or Richter's early recordings of Prokofiev or Liszt concertos (Urania). Hamelin's virtuosity would seem tame in comparison!"
4,Great work monitor,"I've been using this monitor for the past few months in the office. Very good picture for browsing, office applications, and general work duties.I've not tried to watch any movies or do any gaming no it, however the clarity at the native resolution is very impressive indeed. No problems, no dead pixels, no stuck pixels."
5,VHS tape of on and off stage action..,"A must for all Def Leppard Fans. Especially noteworthy, the STEAMY shower scene starring Mr. Savage and Mr. Elliott...It is not to be missed!! END"
4,Great for little Lego-lovers with an artistic side!,"I purchased this set as a gift for my 6-year old niece. She's just started to move from Duplos, designed more for toddlers, to ""real"" Legos. She also loves to draw, and I thought this set would allow her to show that artistic side with Legos instead of crayons or markers. It looks like I guessed well, because she took to this set right away, immediately testing out several of the more simple designs (eg, the heart), and gradually working her way up to the slightly more complex ones. Her 4-year old sister joined in on the fun too, as the included patterns appeal to a range of ages. As other reviewers have already mentioned, it would've been nice to have a way to attach the base to the design and/or to have included additional designs, especially for the price, but overall, this is a creative, enjoyable toy that I would definitely recommend."
3,Great idea but not worth $20,"PLUS: It's a great idea. It keeps my 4-yr old busy, and it helps develop her skills in art, counting, pattern recognition, and fine-motor.MINUS: $20 feels outrageously overpriced. They should have included more than TWO plastic cards so we could have more projects going (what do those cost, 1 cent?) Also it would have been good to have a way to snap the plastic card over the pattern so that it doesn't slide around. The lego pieces are extremely difficult to remove from the plastic card when it's time to disassemble. I bought the large set but it still feels very small. It would be great if they could develop a larger sized version of this, with larger pieces as well, for little hands."
4,Fun for my 4 year old,"This is a fun and educational toy for my 4 year old. This what I saw with her playing with it:1. She learned to following simple instructions from a manual.2. She picked up more motor skill on handling the little pieces.3. She learned faster pattern matching techniques.The only negative thing I would say about this product is that it does not give you enough pieces to complete two art works (illustrated in the manual). If you finished one, you may have to take pieces from it to complete the second one."
3,"DOES NOT CONTAIN 16"" x 16"" BASE PLATES","I bought this item first and foremost because the item description said it contained 16"" by 16"" base plates. It does not. (I should have figured out that they wouldn't have fit into the box it says it ships in.)The base plates are very small. They are 16 lego dots by 16 lego dots, which is 5"" square. Bummer.It's a great toy, but yes, as other reviews have said, they should have created a base that wouldn't slide around when placed over the mosaic guide. I end up holding it THE ENTIRE TIME my children play with it. Definitely more hands-on than I would like!I still give it high ratings because it is fun and keeps my kids engaged."
5,"finally, season 2","I'd just about given up hope that season 2 would ever come to DVD. And now not only is it being released, but with extras! That was the only disappointment about the first season. Now I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the 3rd will come out too. Excellent show, very good writing this season, don't miss it."
3,Just So-So,"I keep hearing how great this concerto is and I want to love it, but, based on this recording, it just doesn't do it for me.Zukerman and Mehta are obviously fine musicians, but this recording just doesn't seem to have any zest or sparkle. I'm going to have to try another one (Heifetz/Munch or Menuhin/Furtwangler) and give it another shot."
3,There are better books on the market than this one,"Following the ""modelling"" ideas of NLP, I thought this a good book to buy. This asumption was based upon the title. Upon reading it, I found very little substance to it, that cannot be found elsewhere, in a better form.My advice if you are strugling then buy WISHCRAFT by Barbara Sher, this book will give you everything, that this book fails to deliver.I could only recomend this title, as a foundation book in positive thinking, giving you a broad outline of some key ideas. There is very little practical substance to make a big difference.This is not really a HOW TO...manual.Recomended but with great caution!!"
4,A Deceptively Familiar Read--With Plenty to Consider,"Having read a number of similar books, I found the content of this one to be familiar--deceptively so. It is a short book, clearly written, and easy to read. But within its covers is plenty of focused advice to consider. While other books use more pages to say essentially the same thing, this one does it better with brevity. At one point the authors recommend ""checking in"" regularly with your gut feelings, and asking for help when you need it. How nice it is to validate gut feelings with another helpful reading of this succinct book."
4,"Think like a millionaire and you will become one, right?","Think like a millionaire and you will become one, right? It's is not that simple, but it definitely sells books. It is easy to think differently for a minute and get excited. Even though it is not easy to achieve success, thinking differently is a must. I cannot say that by simply thinking like a millionaire leads to success, but I will say that not thinking like a millionaire definitely leads to no success. It's the old saying, ""You have to believe in yourself."" The author of another book, Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, explains how thoughts lead to feelings, feelings lead to actions, and actions lead to results.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market? Learn how to invest your money, how to pick stocks, and how to make money in the stock market"
3,Okay book,"It depends on what you want to read about. If you want to know how to meet a unicorn and have adventures with it, this book surely won't be your cup of tea. if you want to learn about the history of unicorns and their origins, buy this book. I bought this book online and I was a little dissapointed. if you want to buy this book, don't buy it online because you will be disspointed like I was."
2,"It was ok, but nothing spectacular.","""Brews"" started out pretty interesting, but lost something along the way....or more accurately, it waxed and waned. Some parts I was really into, other parts not so much. One major drawback for me was that the Hero and Heroine seemed to have the same argument over and over again. Their relationship didn't progress normally with them tackling new problems/issues and growing continuous closer but rather jumped around abruptly from bliss to misery every other chapter with the same old issue that never gets resolve but merely festers. I put the book down at least once before finishing it. Not a good sign."
2,Early expiration date,"Batteries arrived with a two year expiration date. New batteries typically have a six to seven year expiration date at time of sale. If you use the batteries immediately you should have no problem. However, if you retain the batteries for future use the shelf life will be shorter than optimal."
4,"It's for the B side, duh","I agree with the other reviewer. The only reason I have been searching so long for this CD is ""All I Really Need.""The samples are great, if you like swearing and the song is good too. Can't say much about the other remixes, the album version of Rite of Shiva is as good as it gets."
2,:( disappointing,"This is the first product I have ordered off amazon, that I am disappointed with. I bought this product new and when I opened the package, the dvd was bouncing around and is all scratched."
3,Anim'e,"This dvd wasen't too bad, actually i was blown away to find out that it was made in HOLLYWOOD, C.A. If you like scantilly clad women this is for you....."
3,Berlioz in German,"Furtwangler is a great conductor and he does justice to Berlioz. Schwarzkopf is her usual perfect self and she is in good company. Unfortunately, the sound quality is typical of a live recording of the era and makes Hans Hotter's(Mefistofele) voice unpleasant.Interestingly, the German language is not as distracting as one might expect.I would recommend this recording only to Furtwangler and Schwarzkopf fans and serious historic opera collectors."
3,"Furtwangler is white hot, but the sound is wretched","The other reviewer makes the basic points that this post-war German-language boradcast from the Lucerne Festival is sonically primitive and that the performance itself deserves better. But I'd like to udnerline that Furtwangler's Damnation of Faust has stayed around in various reisues on private labels because he is in exceptional form, white hot, in fact. This was a time when Berlioz went largely ignored outside France except for a few works like the Symphonie fantastique and Harold in Italy. To my knowledge, there are no recorded documents of Furtwangler doing either of those works, so this Faust is a tantalizing sample of how great he would have been. All the soloists are outstanding, but the chorus is clunky in the extreme. Since the proceedings were caught in such dim sonics, this release is of interests mainly to collectors and completists."
4,The best book I've read this year.,"I came across Arctic Schoolteacher by accident. I had taken my kids to a summer program at a county library. While we waited for the show to begin, I browsed the shelves and came across this book. I have probably read 20-30 books this year, and Arctic Schoolteacher makes the top of my list. In it, the author tells the story of how she and her husband travelled to a remote Alaskan village in the 1930s as government employees. Abbie taught school, and Ed, her husband, oversaw the reindeer herd. I don't want to give away too much of the story, but the book is filled with the numerous joys and sorrows that Abbie experienced in her two year stay in the Last Frontier. I only wish that Abbie had mentioned more about her life before Alaska, and about how she and Ed met. I am glad that the book included an epilogue by Abbie's daughter that mentions what happened in Abbie's life after Alaska."
3,"It was not about teaching, but about her life in Kulukak.","I ordered this book because I like reading books about teachers in various parts of the world. This book was not about teaching,but about her life in Kulukak. That part was well written, but depressing. I guess it is what life was like there. Abbie Morgan handled the depressing landscape with humor and love. I was disappointed because it was not what I was looking for, but it does not mean that it is not a good book. If you are looking for a description of 1930 Alaska, then this is your book. Morgan describes life in this town with clarity and handles lifes disappointments with grace. She was an amazing woman to have worked there."
4,Embrace your dark side,"My best friend and I differ on opinions on this one. And I think it might have something to do with-she can't relate to anything dark or sinister. Me on the other hand have no trouble going there. True there is a lot of bloody scenes but it only enriches this sad story of a tormented barber who was so in love with revenge that he couldn't see what was in front of him. Acting, direction, music score-everything was just perfect. See this film."
5,Whoo hoo!,I am so excited to get this on DVD. I saw the movie 5 times already and can't wait to own it at home. What a fabulous movie!
5,How 'bout a Shave?,"One of the best films of 2007, next to Pirates 3, Sweeney delivers a supurb cast with brilliant songs and numbers. The dark humour mixed with the overall grusomeness of the story works in burton's favour. Before I go on with the review i would like to say that it is an EXTREMELY violent movie, with emphisis on EXTREMELY. This film is probably not suitibale to children under 10. Anyway, it is one of the best films I've ever seen. The story plays out like a gothic fairy-tale, with deep mistones (The movie is practically black and white, with massive amounts of red).Sweeney Todd is of course a bad guy, but we are allowed to pitty him, and we're ment to be on his and Mrs. Lovet's side. Both Bonham Carter, and Depp deliver astounding performances as actors and vocalists. The supporting cast is well done also. Although the man from ""There Will be Blood"" won best actor, Depp should have taken it."
4,YOU HAVE TO LIKE MUSICALS TO LIKE THIS ONE,"Tim Burton's version of Sweeney Todd which includes the music of Danny Elfman. You have to like musicals to ""get"" this picture. If not then you probably shouldn't bother. It's a tale of revenge, lost love and to paraphrase Tom Wolfe: You Can't Go Home Again. Depp and Carter elevate the rating of this picture. Rickman seems a bit too subdued for my tastes. MY GRADE: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: 08/10/2010."
2,WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER AS STRAIGHT DRAMA,"This movie has received several less than good reviews, and rightfully so. While it is supposed to me a musical, the main characters (Depp and Carter) come across as lackluster singers at best, pathetic at worst. Since they are strongest in straight drama roles, the singing should have been done away with and the movie presented as a mystery thiller."
3,it was entertaining,i had never seen the previews for this movie and this movie just threw me off guard. i did not know it was a musical. i really like musicals and i would of gave it 5 stars but the female lead's voice was too high of a pitch and every time she started singing i just wanted the song to end.it was actually a good movie and I'm glad i watched it till the end
1,What a waste of time and money,"The original 1936 black and white making of this film certainly left something for your imagination and leaves Tim Burton's film in the dust. I'm surprised Johnny Depp fell for the discusting and poor taste of the film's direction and it's too bad Mr. Burton doesn't have the film making skills to leave something for your imagination as the original version. Hitchcock would have directed this movie in a way that would have you leaving the theatre feeling better than then when you arrived, not feeling like you need to take an antacid tablet. Instead Tim goes for the easy. It's amazing how actor's/director's taste have gone downhill. He ruined this film with his Hollywood slasher theme and was a waste of money to see."
3,"Overrated, unfortunately","The movie was engaging, in the typical Tim-Burton way. However, it grew tedious on more than one occasion. The singing is not top quality (let's face it: the actors sing better than I would have, but they are nonetheless actors trying to sing), and the songs lack the choral backup that make the Broadway songs more textured (although Burton said this was intentional, in order to give the performance more of an 'introverted' take on things). Finally, the international cut of the movie is a little too grotesque than it needs to be, giving the movie an air reminiscent of the horror movies of the 1980s. A little more suggestion and less gore would've gone a long way. In summary, neither Burton's nor Depp's best work, but a good effort."
2,"If you like Burton, Depp and Boham-Carter, don't watch this movie!","After wasting what seems like a lot of time watching this flick I am seriously wondering if:- Is this a movie that Burton HAD to do because of a contract?- What was the bad story about?- Why did I buy it?I have been a huge fan of Tim Burton for years, but this movie has NOTHING original in it.The story is shallow, the musical part is weak, there is way too much blood...."
1,A bit to gruesome.,How much blood can one stand in a movie ACK!!!Johnny and Helena are exceptional actors but this got to be to much
2,watch with subtitles,"if you can't follow along because of the singing, or just can't take the musical anymore, mute it, and put the subtitles on. i was able to follow the story and see exactly what they are saying."
2,Disappointing,"I waited for years to see this on the big screen, but have to say it wasn't worth the wait.I found the leads, without exception incapable of delivering the emotion necessary for the music due to inexperience. I very quickly grew tired of Helena Bonham-Carter's endless deadpan, even in moments when something more should have seemed appropriate.Also annoying was the derivative look of the film, based largely on the Universal Horror pics of the Thirties-even Johnny Depps ""Bride of Frankenstein"" hair, and a bit of German Expressionism for good measure.The gore did seem gratuitous in the manner in which it was presented although necessary in context of the film.I wish I could have liked it more."
3,You Could Swim In The Amount Of Blood Shed...,"Despite having a good score, enjoyable songs, and excellent performances by both Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, there was one problem I had with this film.The plot centers around Barker's (or Todd's, I suppose) pursuit for revenge against Turpin (Alan Rickman is great, by the way) I don't have a problem with this crusade. In fact, that would have been a great movie. The problem for me is that in order to ""practice"" he slits the throats of countless extras while waiting for Turpin to arrive.Why is it such a big deal that Turpin tore Barker's life apart, yet the audience isn't supposed to think twice about the wife and kids of the men whose throats Barker slits without a second thought? It's seems condradictory to me...What is the thing that people love so much about anti-hero films? Whatever it is, I seem to have missed it.But really, the acting is good."
5,Sweeney todd the deMon barber,Good movie like always gots to love johnny depp... The movie was as describe got here pretty fast and love it... Just in time for movie night with my husband... You might want to put the kittys in bed before the movie starts is a good story line but kind of gourry but hey its mr depp you have to like his creppy storys but over all great movie
4,Terrifying,"This movie is a monster, a big huge musical Monster and I love ever song and ever little cheek that come with it"
2,overstylized and hoakey,"i'm not the biggest tim burton fan, he seems to be a one note song darn near evereything he does seems to be the same.it's an interesting thing that the ""demon barber"" as depicted in this movie is the handsome johnny depp made up to look like a cartoon character and the authority figures of judges and cops are made as ugly as possible. i mean i've never seen alan rickman look so unkempt and homley. the blood is in comedic proportions and the ""creepiness"" is totally blown by the over the top mannerisms.in this version of sweeney todd the man is made up to be a victim of everything around him. the judge who condemned him, the woman who obsesses over him and feeds his obsession. yet his outlet for this victimisation to randomly kill members of the comunity, which totally ruins any victim sympathy one might feel for him. overall this movie was pretty crap and just not interesting."
2,Not my cup of tea,Love Johnny Depp but not this film. Loved the opera but not the movie. I would not recommend to others
3,Depp and Burton again,"I love Johnny Depp. I love Tim Burton. I love Horror, and I love musical theatre. It is almost like this movie was made just for me. The sets are magical looking. The atmosphere created by Burton is creepy and awsome...I guess this flick fell short from me because the play is so simple and basic yet horrible and fun..and this just seemed...well made up. I you have never seen this performed live you may enjoy it more than I did."
5,Righting wrongs,I have never been so scared in my life - there are just too many peopleout there who cannot overcome their desires to seek revenge. This revengeis usually predigated upon an imagined or a real wrong for which the term'forgiveness' does not even enter into the equation.
5,Sweeney Todd-The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,A great movie and great perfomance from Johnny Depp and Alan Rickman. Very bloody. I would not suggest this to children under 16.
3,Watchable But Flawed,"Though decidedly watchable, Mr. Burton's attempt to translate a great black comedy/tragedy/musical to the screen is only partially successful. The production design is gorgeously macabre, the majority of the cast is quite good and Sondheim's memorable score remains as virtuosic as ever.However...the musical numbers frequently are unimaginatively and repetitively staged (""By the Sea"" being a notable exception) and the two leads are disappointingly miscast. Both Johnny Depp & Helena Bonham Carter are very able and talented actors, but here have not the vocal power, grim humor and maturity required for the parts. While watching the film, this viewer kept thinking that Alan Rickman, here cast as Judge Turpin, would have proved a far more convincing Sweeny; perhaps a Glenn Close or Miranda Richardson, a wonderful Mrs. Lovett.Instead, Depp and Bonham-Carter come off as very talented leads in an ambitious High School production."
1,"When Hearn & Lansbury are available, all copies of this version should be destroyed","Any resemblance between the brilliant Broadway original and this abbreviated piece of pop culture tripe... well, just doesn't exist. Even if you've already seen this version, even if you actually LIKED this film, please do yourself the service of watching one of the complete stagings with the proper casting.It's the emotional difference between stepping off a street curb and jumping off the Empire State Building... one gets you six inches closer to the other side of the street, and the other transports you to another world.Take this sad but necessary advice from a dedicated fan of Burton, Depp and company. This time they've cheated you out of one of life's great transformational experiences, and slapped you in the face with a short skit that has all the artistic impact of a Gong Show outtake."
1,Long boring parts interspersed with short bursts of horrific violence,"I gave this an hour because everyone seems to love it so much. Not me! Be warned. This is a dark, unrelievedly negative film without a hint of humor or anything enjoyable. If you like killing, blood, and lots of incomprehensible, tuneless singing, this is the show for you."
1,Unable to play,"As I have told you on numerous occasions I am registered blind and,having realized that you sent me a Blueray disc instead of a DVD I cannot find a UK return address. Can you help me?Jim Mannus"
1,BORING! Just stone BORING!,"Dearest-On-Earth and I were all pavloved for ""Sweeney,"" after ""Fear And Loathing,"" ""Blow,"" and/or all the ""Pirates."" But after viewing ""Sweeney"" - in abject horror and shock - we both agreed that A) In ""Smokey And The Bandit,"" when Sally Fields inquired of Burt Reynolds, ""do you like Stephen Sondheim?,"" his reply - NO! - was entirely and altogether appropriate; and B) I guess ""we SHOULD have known better,"" because English movies have a justifiable reputation for being stultifyingly BORING. Unnecessarily explicit, too - I mean, snuff films aren't really enjoyable."
1,"Poor color, poor sound","I hated the color, everyone was so dully and dimly lit it was painful to watch. And when they were talking you couldn't hear a word they were saying, but then they'd start singing and it'd burst your eardrums. The plot wasn't bad, and the acting was interesting - although except for the singing neither of the roles was much of a stretch for Depp or Carter. I love Alan Rickman, so enjoyed his presence in the film.I am so sick of the dark circles under the eyes in Burton's movies."
2,Edward Scissorhands goes berserk,"Musicals about serial killers is a tough cinematic sub-sub-genre. Peoples' reactions to them vary widely. Like Edward Lewis said to Vivian Ward about opera: ""They either love it or they hate it. If they love it, they will always love it. If they don't, they may learn to appreciate it, but it will never become part of their soul."" I count myself in that second group -- before the learning to appreciate part.Burton's style is just not that appealing. I *can* appreciate the sheer artistry of his work, everything from the original ""Batman"" to ""Corpse Bride,"" but it just doesn't speak to me. It's depressing and pointless, and elevates style and mood over plot and character development."
2,"Just not a Soundheim fan, I guess","Great performances, and a great look. However, with a musical it is all about the songs, and I hated them all! I guess I'm just not a Stephen Soundheim fan, because there wasn't a single number that I liked, and most of them I wanted to mute (except I couldn't, because just about all the dialogue was sung). 4-stars for acting and production design, but two stars for the movie over all. (And I like musicals! 'Hairspray' was one of the only movies that I have four stars to last year!)"
2,Did I miss something?,"What's the appeal behind Sweeny Todd?I can sympathize with a wronged husband taking revenge on the guy who roofied and ravished his wife. I can appreciate a movie about a slasher on the loose.But I can't help but hate a man who cuts up innocent people and then lets his landlady butcher their remains so she can sell their flesh for food.I have to wonder about the people who thought this movie was such a beautiful experience. I knew it would be weird, after all, it's a Tim Burton affair, but man ....Not that I'm down on Burton. I think he and Depp are a true powerhouse couple. Alan Rickman rules anything he's in. (Harry Potter films wouldn't be the right without him.)The bright light came from Sacha Baron Cohen, the phony Italian rival of Sweeny Todd. It harkens back to the essence of Borat, just enough."
3,Whateva,"This film was so-so. It was nothing to do back flips over but it wasn't bad either. Some parts are unintentionally funny though. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter gave great performances in spite of the films mediocrity. If your somebody thats heavily into musicals this is a must see. But If your someone like me, who cant stand the actors busting out in harmony every five minutes, then you will be annoyed at those parts.Overall, this film is worth a movie rental at best but I don't know if I will add this one to my DVD collection or not."
4,"Oh, the humanity!!!","It's the most horrifically violent musical available on the market today.Besides maybe ""Cannibal, the Musical.""It met my expectations exactly. It's visually surprising and stunning. It has good tunes. It's funny. It's bizarre, shocking and disgusting.I thoroughly enjoyed it! :)"
3,dvd quality sub par,"This is a quick review of the dvd's image quality. Although the image quality is excellent in terms of sharpness, black level, and color, the transfer somehow created lots of shimmering on small straight lines when the camera pans. It is as if it is an interlaced signal being deinterlaced by a bad dvd player. I have not seen a recent, high budget film transfer to dvd look as bad as Sweeney Todd does in this one respect. It was quite distracting at times; though I was watching it on a 106"" screen--it would probably be less noticeable on a small screen."
4,Great remake,"It can never replace the original with Angela Lansberry, but this is a very close 2nd. All I can say is TIm Burton must've had an interesting childhood.Johnny Depp is fantastic, Helen Bonham-Carter is fierce, funny and disturbing. This is a must have.I wonder what priest taste like. Probably like chicken."
4,Beautifully Classic,Great movie. Worth watching and the music is beautifully written.It is a critical improvement from the play.
1,This is one dvd that is a musical and blood and blood and,blood and more blood. Johnny Depp I thought was a better actor then to be in a such a bad film.
1,An astounding disappointment.,"This is perhaps the worst bastardization of a stage musical ever committed to film. The hideous truncation of Sondheim's brilliant score is the central flaw, from which the film can't recover. Another serious liability is the astonishingly bland, one-note performance by Johnny Depp. That this talented actor was so utterly miscast in this role--only to be nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, no less--speaks volumes about what is wrong with Hollywood, circa 2008...and why Hollywood should just stop adapting great stageworks into unfathomably poor film versions."
1,Can't come close to the broadway version,"One word: ""TERRIBLE"" Very weak voices and basically just a terrible job by everyone involved. I feel sorry for those who never seen this on Broadway with Angela. If you did you will know exactly what i mean. Now she is an actress. Where do they find these Hollywood people? The more movies i see the more i think movies will come to an end soon. There is simply no talent in Hollywood anymore. Usually when a Broadway musical is made into a movie like Sound of Music, they try to do it even better than the Broadway version. I think those days are over. Don't bother with this piece of trash. Rent the DVD instead. It's funnier, not as crowed with dialog, better music orchestration and better all around. I was very disappointed in this one."
1,what a surprise,Wasn't expecting a musical comedy and since I don't do comedy or musicals twenty (20) minutes of this was enough for me.
5,A worthy screen adaptation,"I love the tale of Sweeney Todd. I have been since I first saw a recording of the stage production back in the early 90's. When I heard that Tim Burton was helming a big screen adaptation I was ecstatic. Finally something to wash away the abomination vomited forth by John Schlesinger that starred Ben Kingsley.My hopes were high and I was not disappointed. Yes, the film adaptation removed some of the musical scenes found in the Sondheim stage show, but they where scenes that would probably have left a movie going audience feeling that the movie was to long. We didn't need the scene of Judge Turpin flagellating himself for his impure thoughts to realize he was not a good person. As much as I would have liked the intro to have the Ballad of Sweeney Todd it wasn't needed to help layout the story.To me this was a well cast, well acted, well directed and truthful adaptation to the stage play."
4,Delighted to see Sweeney Todd reach a wider audience!,"I first saw Sweeney Todd at the Davis Musical Theatre Company, mid to late eighties, completely unprepared for the marvelous assault that is Sondheim's best musical. This version, while of necessity hacking away much of the music, hews closely (yes, I intend hacking and hewing in the same sentence) to the story and does sufficient honor to this amazing score. Would I have preferred better singers? Of course. But the acting, the effects, all else make up for that, and marvelous alternatives exist on DVD for theatrical purists. Bravo to all involved!"
5,"Not so much a ""movie"" and an opera on film","Johnny Depp once again proves that he can do anything, and that the Academy has overlooked him for too long. His performance in Sweeney Todd is simply amazing. A dark, hateful, vicious character that no one in their right mind would find themselves rooting for, but I did.There are many long reviews about this film already posted, so I'll leave them to dissect the entire plot, the music, and the other characters. I will just tell you that if you go in looking for your standard horror show, you will be dissappointed. If you are looking for a beautifully cast, filmed, acted, and directed picture, this is the one for you."
5,One word: WOW!,"I have waited months for this to come to the big screen and it surpassed even my wildedst dreams!! I felt the casting was just perfection! Each and every cast member fit their role and played it EXTREMELY well I thought. Johnny Depp, of course, was magnificent in this role, displaying the madness/rage the character had to feel. If you love the play, you will love this! Just remember it IS a moive and there will be differences from the play....judge it as it as....not a play but an extraordinary film adaptation of the play!"
4,Great film,"I love this musical. Burton is amazing. But if you don't like blood and dark, depressing films, this is not for you."
2,Not as good as the Broadway version,"I suspect that most reviewers who gave this movie five stars have not seen the other version of Sweeney Todd -- the version starring George Hearn and Angela Lansbury. Here:Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (Broadway) (Keepcase)or here:Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (Broadway) (Snap Case)The movie sets are terrific, as is the instrumental music and the direction, but neither Johnny Depp nor Helena Bonham Carter can sing as well as Hearn or Lansbury. This is not to say that they are bad, but they just don't measure up to Broadway's demanding standards.Although I was very much looking forward to getting a newer version of this grisly story, I will stick with my older DVD for the superior voices on it. This new one disappointed me."
4,Casting Could Have Been Better for Mrs. Lovett,"Most people have said all there really is to say about this film. I liked it very much, in spite of what I considered to be excessive blood and guts, but my one true complaint is the casting of Helena Bonham Carter. She can't sing -- even remotely -- and she doesn't even have the talent to talk her way through a song, a la Yul Brynner in ""The King and I"" or Rex Harrison in ""My Fair Lady."" It really doesn't work to cast a completely tone deaf person in a musical role, and that brings down the entire production.Tim Burton would have done better not to cast his girlfriend in his film."
3,Love The Movie But The DVD ....,I'm a huge Johnny Depp fan & I had to replace my old copy of Sweeney Todd. So I purchased a new copy. In the description it said DVD was brand new & when I recieved the DVD it was in wrap but the DVD it self had scratches. When I played the DVD it skipped about three times. Thank God I have a DVD scratch cleaner if not I would have sent it back. Shipping was very fast also.
3,Seems a downright shame...,"Seems an awful waste... To take such a brilliant work as Sondheim's Todd and chop it all to bits...After seeing this movie, my sister-in-law said she didn't understand why my brother and I consider ""Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" to be one of the greatest Broadway musicals of all time. In answer, we treated her to the DVD of the 1982 Angela Landsbury / George Hearn production. If you've never seen Sweeney Todd performed live, get that marvelous nearly full version."
2,Too Much Blood!,"I Love a good movie and I like seeing ones that are different. This starts off as this different little musical to nothing but slitting throats and blood gushing out everywhere. Then the bodys are being ground up and put into meat pies for everyone to feed on. Oh my, watch out for nails, fingers and toes! Sorry Johnny, love your other work but I cannot recommend this one to anyone. Only sick people would enjoy this one."
2,A bloody time for all,"Classic Tim Burton production with the macabre visuals. But it is loaded up with gore via Mr. Todd slicing and dicing the throats of his clients. We get to see the spewing of blood in all its glory. Tough to watch and in the end, a needless visual which takes away from what could have been a very enjoyable film. **Bnb Beatles Depot**"
1,Worst Music Mix Ever,"I finally got around to renting this movie and was seriously disappointed.The story was mediocre.The costumes were excellent.The singing was at best amateurish. When is Hollywood going to get it thru their head that a musical requires people who can sing. If these voices had been in the Broadway version they would have been laughed off the stage.Worst of all, the sound mix was terrible. The orchestration was so loud that better than 70% of the movies lyrics and dialog were unintelligible. I spent most of the movie trying to guess what they were saying or singing.Most of the people that wrote good reviews of this product are sheep that are continuing to mouth the praises of the Broadway version. I bet they never even heard the DVD version.Don't waste your money on this piece of junk."
1,Sweeney Todd DVD,I will never buy from this company again. i recieved the dvd and there were so many scratches on it that i could only play it on a certain dvd player. I would send it back but im not in the same area as i sent it and im afraid if i do i will never get a response.
3,"The Good, The Bad, The Bloody Bad","The best thing going for the film adaptation of ""Sweeney Todd"" is Johnny Depp's portrayal of the mad barber. The person in charge of costumes should be nominated for an Oscar in that category. The scenes of London are very atmospheric and work well. Alan Rickman as Judge Turpen and Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett give respectable performances. On the other hand, there is not a memorable song from the entire movie. Stephen Sondheim may be one of our greatest composers, but I wouldn't know that from the music included here. There is no ""Send In The Clowns"" or anything close to it in ""Sweeney Todd."" I was not humming any of the tunes as I left the theatre; I just just glad the bloody mess was over. Yes, everything you may have heard about the blood and gore is accurate and then some.A real disappointment."
3,Another Tim Burton Goth Fest!!!,"Because it's a Tim Burton film, you automatically know it's going to be gothic, have Johnny Depp, and wierd Danny Elfman music! It had a good storyline, if they hadn't sung throughout almost the entire movie. Johnny Depp looked awesome as Sweeney Todd. Mrs. Lovett was hot and sexy in a very creepy way. I do like when Sweeney is singing and he is slicing people's throats in the barber chair. The gore was pretty cool! If you are a goth and like Tim Burton films, you'll probably like SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET!!!"
5,AWESOME! One of the best films of the year!,"Awesome adaptation of the musical by Stephen Sondheim...directed by none other than Tim Burton and starring an amazing Johnny Depp in the title role. Everything about this film is perfect!Depp plays a man formerly named Benjamin Barker, who comes back to his hometown after 15 years after being banished by Judge Turpin, who rapes his wife and kidnaps his daughter in his absence. Benjamin returns later on, hears about his wife and daughter's fate, and vows to take revenge...even if it means killing off the entire town. So, he opens up a little barber shop, changes his name to Sweeney Todd, and teams up with a cook named Mrs. Lovett, and well, you're in for a big treat. It's extremely dark and sick, but you'll be singing along all the way to the end!If this doesn't win any Oscars, I'll be pissed. SEE IT NOW!"
5,Tim Burton does it again,"Stunning Blue-Ray of a classic Sondheim musical. Johnny Depp is one of his generation's kinkiest, deepest actors--and he can sing. Helena Bonham-Carter is only slightly less stellar. The production's dark color values of gray, black and red are a wonderful complement to the dark-and-bloody story."
2,Not as good as the competition.,"I've owned both the Pet Blinker and the Bling Bling pet blinker. The Bling is at least twice as bright. The Pet Blinker is well-tooled. So, if you want an attractive decoration, buy the Pet Blinker. However, if you want an effective system, buy a couple of Bling Bling pet blinkers. (I mounted four blings, one on each corner of my dog's backpack. You can easily see him from a hundred yards away at night!)"
3,Modine is doggy while others are fine,"If you can bear to see Matthew Modine arrogantly and self-righteously mugging for way too long, give it a try. There are some wonderful bits in it, though it probably is DiCillo's weakest film. But he's always fun to watch, and the Madonna bit is delightful!"
4,Small budget film on.......superficiality?,"The male protagonist doesn't have much as far as status goes. He is a waiter/caterer and sleeps with his landlord. He is obviously frustrated with his situation but does not express it to anyone. He is on a quest for a ""real blonde"" for purity and symbolism! But I think it really has something to do with obtaining status. There are many far more potentially offensive R movies than this. If it were not for some brief explicit lines the movie could have a PG-13 rating instead of an R rating. The movie actually has some sweetness near the end and has a positive message without being ""preachy"".Watch this with a group of friends and each may have a different interpretation."
2,Another NY Movie,"This somewhat entertaing (yet ultimately forgettable) romantic comedy/ drama presents the daily life of an average NY young couple, played by Matthew Modine and Katherine Keener. Modine`s character tries to become a sucessful actor, but most of the time he just fails miserably and ends up feeling an untalented loser. His girlfriend then questions their relationship and worries about their future as a couple. ""The Real Blonde"" is just another hip and mildly clever look at NY people and their daily routines. It also shows some insight into that ""looks can be deceiving"" line of thought, trying to analyse what`s real and what`s fake (hence the title ""The Real Blonde"", get it?). Not too distant from some ""Sex and the City"" territory, this effort is amusing at parts but has little staying power.Worth watching once."
1,Faceless Music,"This is another example of faceless as well as tasteless ""music"" comming from Raleigh. Please hang on to your day jobs and leave music to the big boys."
2,Excitement to Disappointment,"While the silver casings were very nice, I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the scarabs in these earrings. The scarabs were poor quality, and one scarab was smaller than the other. More glue than scarab showed in the setting. Silver Speck refunded my money with no problem, however, retaining my future business."
3,"Same ideas, different characters","The first half of this book- well, lets be fair here- the first three quarters of the book really hooked me and I read through them in one day. Yet after that, the book suffered, because it took on a route extremely similar to The Devil's Advocate. It's as if Mr. Neiderman really enjoyed his previous work to the point of making it heavily influence this one. If it hadn't been for the heavy ""Advocate"" shadow on this book, it would have got a much higher rating than it did. It nevertheless is an effective page turner."
2,Not a book I liked...,"This is probably a bit of a harsher review than I'd normally give, but I really did not enjoy this book, for several reasons. First, it is painfully similar to The Devil's Advocate toward the end. Second, the main antagonist, Jules Bois, is hardly in the book at all (when basically everything that is happening has to do with him...). Next, Grant is a psychiatrist, and most of the information about psychiatry in the book is inaccurate. I know, not highly important or anything, but it definitely had a hand in my dislike of the book. And well, the book over all failed to keep my interest; I finished it more out of duty than for fun.I think if I had read this book before The Devil's Advocate, I might not have been so critical of it. But in all honesty, I just didn't like it. It started out strong and interesting, but then went in a slow downward spiral of nothingness. It was a great idea for a novel, but it just didn't work out well."
2,Not please,"Although this watch claims to be water resistant, after wearing in around water for a day in the heat, it now has a layer of fog inside the watch glass and I cannot see the time. Since the watch was out of warranty, there was nothing they could do."
5,Cyan Toner Drum,Okidata c5150n is no longer made so was happy to find part needed to continue use of this pinter. Amazon had best price I could find.
1,Justifiable rape....,"In the first few pages of this book it basically states that if a woman chooses to be independent and not rely on ""masculine protection"" from a father or husband and gets raped, then she deserved it. I almost stopped reading right there. The only reason that I have read beyond that part of the Introduction of this book is because the woman I seek to spend the rest of my life with's father wants me to. This man treats his own wife and family like a dictator and is at times quite sexist. All in the name of God no less. This book has helped me learn more about him and what I don't want my marriage to be like."
4,a must read for anyone who plans to date,"I was throughly impressed with this book. It was short, easy to read, and straight to the point. Biblical courtship brings back the respect men and women deserve in their mutual interactions. Biblical courtship also shows dating for what it is - a game. I appreciate his emphasis on the importance of the father in the family. The father has an awesome job as husband, protector of his daughter, and example for his son. When the father falters, the family falls apart. The father is the unsung hero who deserves much respect. Thank you, Mr. Wilson, for writing this book."
1,Sexism and misogyny abound in this abomination,"This book, besides being an incredible bore, is horribly sexist and misogynistic! He attempts to persuade readers that, as fathers, our daughters are our property. And that any young man who wishes to date (although that is a dirty word in Wilson's book) our daughters must first seek approval from her father. As fathers we do not own our daughters and it is not our place to give her away in marriage or to force young men to recieve our permission to date our daughters. This paradigm is dangerous for women. It has been proven that if men see women as objects (to be given or taken from the previous owners their fathers) and not as people, there is a greater chance that a woman will be physically, sexually or psychologically abused. Douglas Wilson has a hatred of of women that runs deep and is subtly presented in this book. You would do best to run away from this book and to treat you daughter like a HUMAN BEING! Not as an object..."
1,Twaddle for the Control Freak,"This silly little essay, written by the self-ordained tinpot dictator of a strangely Anglophilic storefront church in a tiny Western cow town, suggests that fathers and husbands can secure their marriages by cutting off women's options to make sexual and romantic decisions for themselves. It's nonsense, of course, dressed up in the kind of muscular Christian rhetoric that made the Victorians so sick-making. Women in this man's church aren't allowed to vote--why should they be allowed to make an informed decision about marriage or sex? Luckily, most people don't stay in churches like this for long--they wake up and smell the orgasms out in the real world."
4,"Dan Schutte's Here I Am, Lord","I bought this collection because I saw the song, Here I Am, Lord written by Daniel Schutte. I grew up singing this song and many other pieces from the St. Louis Jesuits and this continues to be one that has deep meaning for me. In addition, the other pieces in this collection are very enjoyable to listen to, not only for worship but for time of reflection."
5,Wanna Feel Patriotic?,"Listen to the track ""Sweet Freedom."" Michael puts together a good compelation, but this one was the best. My jaw dropped, the song is so good. Play it loud!"
3,His Hits Are All Here!,"I never really cared much for Michael McDonald and actually felt that him becoming a part of the Doobie Brothers was their downfall. As the years have gone on and bittersweet memories have faded...I have to give him credit for his solo work. I bought this CD a few months ago and was surprised at how many hit songs that he has. As far as I can tell they are all here!He has two good duets on this one....One with James Ingram, Yah Mo Be There, and the other with Patti LaBelle, On My Own. My personal favorites are Sweet Freedom and I Keep Forgettin"" (Everytime You're Near). Buy it if you like blue-eyed soul!"
3,Too old,"In the description of this book it was not mentioned that this is the 2004 edition. It does say so on the cover, if you enlarge the image of the cover.The laws about Roth IRAs have changed since then. However, up to date info is available on the Fairmark website."
5,Quick delivery; good price,"CD delivered as described. Jewel case has crack on front. May have occurred during transit. Overall, pleased with transaction."
2,Absolutely no action in this book!!,"When reading the summary on the book jacket for this book I was expecting a real action oriented novel. Boy was I disappointed. There is absolutely nothing going on in this book. You get to hear a lot about Jack Walsh and his goofy brother. He meets some other goofy characters that help him along the way. Then you get to the big ending. Anyone who has ever read a suspense novel can figure out the ending in this book. Overall, not a very good book (but that's just my opinion). :-("
2,Ok Movie,"This an ok movie that portrays a man who is beginning recovery. It certainly does do a good job with showing the denial of addiction. I won't watch it again, but it was a good one to watch one time. I was required to watch it for a class I am taking."
4,Great simple watch for divers,"I just started diving, and wanted a simple but reliable watch. Yes, this watch is heavy, but it feels solid built and looks great. It also has very good visibility underwater. I have several watches, but often find myself wearing this one when working outdoors. If it gets dirty, just hose it off."
1,A sad necessity,"This is another poorly written text for university-level writing students. Judge this one by the cover. Unfortunately, you will buy this anyway because you are probably one of the millions of suckers who are forced to do so by the current institutional textbook scandal."
5,Simply Wing Chun Kung Fu,"This book is excellent and well worth reading. It is full of meaningfull diagrams and illustrations rather than the ususal self promoting photos of similar books. The diagrams set out in detail the clinical muscular and skeletal positions and structures of each technique. The text explains why and how each technique and structure works, the skeletal alignment and muscular structure required and a simple check list to ensure the positions can be checked correctly. In short this book delves in great detail into how and why Wing Chun works on an anatomical basis.Fantastic!"
5,A Compassionate View of Mistaken Choices,"Told in a compelling and insightful manner, this book is a must read for all prison reformers and those interested in the workings of a family under enormous stress. Kraig writes with a poet's eye and a loving wife's perspective, to unfold the tragedy of her family and her husband's life."
4,Compelling Perspective,"Gene Kraig's book offers a compelling perspective on the criminal justice system. Readers are likely to emphatize with her situation and that of her family as they faced a criminal prosecution that does certainly doesn't appear warranted in this narrative. When Ms. Kraig spoke at Wayne State University Law School recently, students found her story moving as a behind-the-scenes account from a non-lawyer who understood all too well the consequences of legal tactics. Others are likely, too, to believe this a worthwhile work."
1,10th and Wolf not filmed there!,"Being a native of South Philly, where 10th & Wolf is located, it would have been nice if the movie was filmed there. The movie wasn't filmed in the neighborhood, in South Philly in general, not in Philadelphia on the whole or even ANYWERE in the state. Pass this cheapy over!"
4,Almost complete,"This book is a very nice work in the Star Wars universe, since it encompass not only the classic Trilogy, but also the new Trilogy and the New Republic facts. The only problems that I see in it are that the entries are very shor in some cases, missing some information and the illustrations are very poor in most of the cases. However, it is a good book for a Star Wars fan."
4,Dog-eared and tattered.,"As a prospective Star Wars novel author and a HUGE Star Wars Fan, I found this book to be invaluable. However, as most of the others have said, it sorely needs to be updated. Also, some descriptions conflict with each other. But all in all, I would consider this a MUST HAVE for any Star Wars fanatic that wants to know some of the nitty-gritty details of the Star Wars Universe."
2,Needs an update!,"This was a great book when it came out, but with more than 20 new books since then, not to mention the Special Edition movies, you're better off to save your money"
4,Excellent source of fairly up to date information...,"This book is highly informative, updated to include everything up to around Hero's Trial (New Jedi Order), which makes it a must even if you already have the more presentable Star Wars Encyclopedia. While the Encyclopedia has more interesting and fact filled entrys, it's also hideousely out of date, a problem that this one would easily correct! I read it cover to cover in a few days, and was quite impressed with how much research went into it, and how few errors were made. Even so, I have to say I'd recommend this book mainly to fans experienced with EU stuff, lest they quickly become lost and overwhelmed."
4,A complete Star Wars dictionary,"Very complete dictionary including all characters appeared on the SW universe. You can have a brief and precise description of each one (includes books in which appeared)A ""must have"" for fans and reccommended for beginners who want to catch a glimpse of characters."
2,Not enough new Info,"This book although useful in its own right as a reference tool for a star wars fan is useless to the owner of an earlier revision. This book did not include very many things and is poorly organized. The content it does have is good and can be very helpful, but it is lacking loads of information on recent books and comics."
5,Very useful,"Very informative book, covering an extensive range of animals. Descriptions have plenty of detail. Not just visual ID book, but a reference book on what makes them tick."
3,Broken on Arrival,"I purchased this a few days before Christmas because my old microwave had died. On arrival (overnight), the door wouldn't open. Since I didn't have time to wait for areplacement, I took off the cover and discovered the door opening mechanism lying on the bottom of the microwave on the other side. I figured out how to reattach the door opener, but this should have NEVER happened on a new in the box product. The microwave works well, but Panasonic has serious quality control issues at their plant."
3,Does the job....,"I have owned this microwave for fourteen months and use it twice daily. It does what it is supposed to do. Cleans up nicely, accommodates even large size bowls/dishes. The only negative I have to report, and it's a biggie, is that after about 12 months, sometimes the door ""sticks"" when you push the door release button, nothing happens and the door will NOT open. You have to press on the door release button AND pull at the door from the top at the same time in order to force it open. But, of course, it is out of warranty now and to pay shipping/handling to return it for service would cost almost half as much as a whole new unit would cost so I'll just use it as is until it no longer performs and then I'll replace it. I will NOT buy another Panasonic brand which disappoints me as I have had such good experience with this brand of television."
3,Panasonic Microwave,The first one quit working after two weeks. Amazon.com replaced it and I printed out a postage prepaid slip to send the other back. Good service!
5,WONDERFUL WONDERFUL MICROWAVE,Having gone from an 18 year old microwave not doing much of anything to this 1250 watt is like night to day. Can't believe how fast and hot it is. Being able to cook and reheat with sensory without having to remember times or heat levels is wonderful. Am having to relearn times and heat levels on things that I want to cook the old way but those are the least of it. Foodis done perfectly. Would recommend to anyone.
5,"Not as big, not a problem","I owned a sharp microwave for almost 10 years and it never had a problem until it burned out a few weeks ago. The reviews for this panasonic were all favorable and it fit almost all my needs to a tee. The only complaint is that the inner space is not as large as it appears. My large drinking glasses dont fit and I have had to switch to a large cup to heat my soups and other drinks, but that is not a deal breaker. The oven looks nice and it works well, and I have notieced that my heating times have come down about 25% due to the new microwave technology used on this machine. It cooks and heats up things very fast and very evenly. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase. As always, amazon did a fantastic job with delivery and packing."
1,Crap Packing,"As soon as I opened the packaging (which wasnt that great) I found 1/2 inch of the rear left corner being chipped. Been using it for a while now n I have no other complaints so far. The rest of it is fine, the features n the functionality is great. Wanted to exchange it for a new one but found out it costs an arm n a leg to ship them back so I have to live with it. Such a disappointment!"
5,Large and Powerful,"We love how much we can fit in it, and we love how quickly it cooks things.Maybe we just always had wimpy microwaves, but normally if a frozen mean says 3 minutes, you have to give it 3.5But with this puppy I would do 2.5 - 2.8 minutes, and it would be done."
5,Excelent product so far.,Arrived without a hitch and so far i love it. excellent features and works like a charm. I will update if anything changes.
2,Microwave,"We purchased as a new microwave on a Sunday and it was not shipped untila week later. It was another five days before we received product.When we received it, and the box was beat up and damaged (old).We open the first box, and noticed the next box holding the glass plate was ripped apart. We removed the microwave from the box, checked it andstarted using it. Then the door handle broke and is not working properly. You have to push it two or three time to open the door.I did not purchase a display microwave, if this was suppose to be anew microwave, something is wrong here.I do not recommend buying appliances on the internet, too risky."
1,First one arrived water logged and box severly damaged,We didn't even open it - everything had been soaked with water and was still damp and the box had been dropped. It was delivered by FED-EX. We have to rate this a 1 based upon it - we shall see what the next unit we receive is like as we ordered a replacement.
1,I'll never buy another Panasonic.,"I purchased a Panasonic over-the-range microwave when I remodeled my kitchen in 2005. The circuit board burned out the first time after 11 months. Luckily it was still under warranty. The circuit board burned out again after another couple of years. I ordered one online and replaced it myself. It burned out again just recently and found out that the part has been discontinued. I called Panasonic support and they spent over an hour transferring me back and forth between two departments, asking me for the same information over and over again. This support was coming from the Philippines. I requested to speak to a customer service representative in the USA, but was told that was not possible. Eventually they just said they were sorry, but there was nothing they could do for me. I will never buy another Panasonic appliance."
4,Great service from Amazon,"I ordered the microwave on th 21st of December and it arrived bright and early on the 23rd. I was grateful to get it before Christmas. The speedy service was wonderful. This Panasonic microwave oven was the exact one I had looked at in a local store, so I knew what I was getting."
3,Panasonic Microwave,I recently purchased a Panasonic NN-H765BF microwave oven to replace a Toshiba unit that finally failed after over 30 years of faithful trouble free service. The Panasonic unit arrived in good order but completely failed after one day of use! The main power transformer burned out after only a few minutes of operation. The local Panasonic support center repaired it under warranty at no cost but who knows how long it will last before failing again? Panasonic is usually a reliable manufacturer but I would choose another brand if buying again.
4,MICROWAVE,"always room for improvement, lets see if this microwave will last anytime, like forever. does good job heating and cooking. wanted to buy american made but have had bad luck mostly with GE. this unit is a little narrow so have to pay attention putting items in, use to it now.less time for heating and cooking items with 1250 watts, amazon had a great deal with free shipping and a discount certificate, feel as if I stole it. great price. buy american if you can..."
1,P>O>S,"after exactly 2 years, the thing just quit working. i get a code H97. when i went to panasonic web site, they steered me to a local repair man!!!! micro was weak from day received. for 1200 watts, it took 9 minutes to bake a potatoe!!!! door is very difficult to close. i am a last time buyer of anything Panasonic."
2,I returned it.,"I gave this product a 2 star rating just because it did run. Beyond that, I thought it was a complete waste of time and effort to carry it in the house and unpack it. I bought this product to replace an 4 year old Sharp microwave that broke down. Compared to the Sharp, it is very poor. I know I can do better so I returned it."
4,"Over a Year, Still Works Great","We purchased this unit as we didn't have one. (Shock, horror, no microwave?!) We've been quite satisfied with our purchase. It is powerful, large enough to fit everything we've needed to put in it, and has an array of features we've probably only half used. I'd definitely consider another Panasonic unit to replace this one . . . assuming it lasts us for years to come anyway. :)"
3,tv interference,"I gave this as a gift. I have witnessed the interferance on the Television set and tried to isolate it by plugging the oven and the tv into different outlets but no help was found using this procedure. Tried to call mfr, what a joke, they said to do what we already tried i.e. swapping the outlet. However, the oven cooks and heats very good just don't watch tv while doing it."
4,Good microwave,I haven't had a new microwave for about 15 years and I think I made the right choice with this one. I haven't had a chance to use all the features but all of the things I have tried have worked perfectly. One of the reasons I purchased this model was a lot of the reviews were updated after yearsof use and were all positive. Here's to 15 more years!
5,Outstanding product,"Using for a month, it's a substitute for an old Samsung.Very very large, unless you're a professional cook you wont need anything larger.Economic. Uses half the time needed by my old one (served me well for more than 10 years). I gave five stars and could be six if it had a browner."
4,Fantastic service and product too.,I placed the order for this microwave on Feb 6 and received it on Feb 8- in 2 days and that too with standard free shipping. It was amazing. The oven works quietly and heats the food much faster. I love it. I would recommend this microwave oven to anyone who is looking for a good bargain.
2,sparks during first use,"Granted, I bought this microwave from Amazon Warehouse Deals in ""Like New"" condition, but upon unboxing, I noticed a misaligned exterior panel. Continuing, I set up the microwave and attempted to heat a cup of cold water in a microwave-safe ceramic cup--a routine I had done countlessly with my previous GE microwave--but within five seconds, the microwave emitted a strange buzzing sound and red flashes inside. I quickly stopped the microwave, unplugged, repackaged, and scheduled a return pickup. At least, don't buy this ""Like New."""
4,microwave,"I am very happy with my new Panasonic microwave, model NN-H765BF. The unit is relatively light weight, has good power and heats things quickly. I particularly like the rotating tray which assures even heating. I would certainly recommend this microwave to anyone who needs a full-size oven."
1,Died in 10 months.,"This thing was working fine until a few days ago. I noticed the light inside would flicker and the power would fluctuate. Today it died. No power. Nothing on the display. Nada. I can see by all of the one star reviews that trying to get a new one, or get this thing repaired will only lead to frustration. So I am going to huck this thing in the trash and head to a big box store with a liberal return policy! By the way, I paid $129 here at Amazon. Amazon is great, I love Amazon customer service, but if I have to deal with Panasonic forget it. I'm stocking this one up to experience."
2,Broken within a couple months,"I did my homework, I looked around and read reviews on multiple websites.Eventually I went with this unit. It works well, when it works. It heats quickly and evenly. It is great at popping popcorn.Unfortunately it was broken within a couple months. Amazon won't let me return it and the nearest Panasonic service center is 1 hour away.The unit started out not recognizing the door was shut every once in awhile, this soon became you had to slam the door for it to admit the door was shut. Eventually no matter what you did, it would not recognize that the door was closed.We have taken it to an authorized Panasonic service center (which is an hour away), and it is going to take them a week to fix."
1,If you care about your Wireless Network...,"... then AVOID All Panasonic microwaves with Inverter technology like the plague!!!This wonderful advancement seems to be in every Panasonic microwave these days and it'll take down any wireless system, be it a home networks (Apple Airport in my case), baby monitors, telephones, you name it. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for your heating up needs."
1,No guarantee from Panasonic,"Microwave had a microprocessor failure after seven months. To our great surprise Panasonic refused to replace it. Instead they insisted it be taken to a ""service center"" (Were they planing to ""Fix""it?). The ""center"" is over fifty miles from our house so they said they would pay the shipping. However, they seem to think that a large heavy item like this microwave can be packed and shipped for $20.00. This means we would have to ""Pay"" to get them to honor their guarantee. Frankly we'ed rather throw it away and buy another one from someone else."
4,Great microwave!,This microwave works great and is the perfect size for what we need. Our large square plates would not fit in our old microwave but they fit in this unit. The black color looks great in our kitchen. Love the sensor reheat button!
2,Not so hot.,"This microwave, in my opinion, doesn't work any better than the non-sensor kind I had before (a Sharp 1100 watt that's identical-looking), and it's definitely not as powerful, though it's supposed to be 1250 watts. The cabinet's a little taller, but not much bigger than a 1.2 cubic foot unit. The fan's very noisy, and the turntable is making scraping noises, and everything is installed correctly. The sensor works, but undercooks most foods. The popcorn setting doesn't even come close to cooking long enough. I'd buy a regular (non-sensor) microwave for less cash. My previous Sharp microwave lasted 38 years before a wire wore through and fried the circuit board. I'm sure it would still be running if that hadn't happened."
3,Too much sliding,This microwave oven is like an an older one we had. It is very good but smaller than the last one. My one complaint is that the plate is very hard to position on the turning rack when there is food on the plate. It slides around and takes several tries to get it positioned correctly. Otherwise a great oven for the price.
4,Very Impressive,I really like the microwave. It looks good and is very powerful.Never really have to worry about the inside of food being much colder like older microwaves are known for.I really like the automatic cooker where you just click 'Frozen' and it will automatically cook the food until it is done. The only down side I have found that it that a lot of times it will overcook your food. I wish (and there may be one that I haven't found) and adjustment to set modify the sensor temperature.But as far as the regular use I have had zero problems with it and we use it daily.
1,Will never know how good this microwave is....,"Arrived quickly, plugged it in and dead as a door knob! Nothing showed up in the display and yes I plugged it into multiple outlets. My other microwave was dying so I purchased this one rather than wait for my other microwave to die so I would not be without a microwave. I have now ordered a Sharp and will keep my fingers crossed. Of course I now have no microwave and have to return this defective one. It is unfortunate but nothing today is made well and yet the costs are fairly high. I feel sorry for those that can't afford these continual breakages, let alone the initial cost for these products."
2,Would Not Buy Again,"Tends to heat the lower level of the item being cooked, but the upper levels stay cold.Door sticks, as noted in other reviews. Worked fine as a push button at first, but gradually degraded to the point where we need to push the button and pull the door.One year after purchase, and I will replace. Quality unacceptable and disappointing."
5,Wonderful Microwave,"I bought this unit as a replacement to the same model I had previously owned for more than ten years. It is very easy to use and has a large capacity and has a convenient oven light. I have read some reviews of the door latch not working properly, but I have not experienced that problem on either of the two ovens I have owned. I would recommend this oven to anyone looking for a reliable microwave oven."
5,Delighted! Much gratitude.,"Very efficient, fast delivery by Amazon, well-packed, in perfect condition. Thanks much, Amazon.com!Quiet, beautiful microwave. I enjoy the large interior and large turntable, easy to clean.User-friendly and well lighted easy-to-read touchpad. Figured it out without having to read much of the instructions.Love the 1250 watt power! Heats and warms fast!The inverter defrost has quickly and evenly defrosted frozen food. More nice features I have not used yet, such as Keep Warm, Genius Sensor Reheat, Sensor Cook.What an excellent job, Panasonic! Much gratitude and respect."
3,Good While It Lasted,My first microwave lasted for 23 years. I bought this Panasonic to replace it and this one only lasted for 3 years and 6 months. Worked well but then just completely died yesterday. Seems like reliability is an issue for many of the manufacturers.
1,Absolute GARBAGE!!!!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS MICROWAVE. I have never been so dissatisfied with a product I've purchased over Amazon. It was defective right out of the box. CHEAPLY MADE IN CHINA. Others have had similar problems with this product. The microwave is made out of cheap plastic, poorly constructed. The fan malfunctioned and the unit overheated causing a small fire....and this was only after 5 minutes of use....RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX. I'm filing a consumer complaint. Panasonic has really crapped up their products over the years."
3,A brief review,"The microwave itself works well, it heats quickly and efficiently. The problem with this model, or at least my unit, is the door. I believe it's because of a defective design that uses cheap parts; the button sticks and incompletely opens the door. This hasn't happened with any other microwave that I've seen. Yes, it still works, but it's annoying trying to pry the door open with one hand and jiggling the button with the other."
3,Was great till died,"This oven worked very well for us, right up till it died unexpectedly exactly 1 year and 2 weeks after we received it. Just past the warranty. Our previous GE wasn't nearly as nice, but it lasted well over 10 years."
4,Very good product,This microwave replaced our old panasonic. On our old panasonic the mechanical release for the door broke and we had to trash it. I have a fear the same thing may happen on this one too. I wonder if there can be a sturdier door release system.Other than that I am very happy with it. I use it to mostly heat food and cook oatmeal.In my opinion this is a very good product. I have not had to use the manual yet.
4,This is a good microwave,"We've had this microwave for a month and overall, it is a good microwave. I would have given it 5 stars except it is loud when in use, and I like being able to use the timer function and if I want, to microwave something simultaneously, which this microwave won't allow. It cooks well, is easy to use, and fits perfectly as a countertop unit. The microwave door is lightweight, which at first I thought felt chintzy, but then grew to actually like, because my kids used to slam our old (heavier) microwave door shut, and this one they have to hold and guide to close it. Hopefully it will last longer that way!"
4,Instructions leave a lot to be desired,"Booklet of instructions is very brief. My previous microwave was mucheasier to operate. I'm sure I'll get used to this one, but would haveliked a better instruction manual."
1,Died in less than a month,"I'm guessing this was probably a fluke, but it died in less than 1 month. I did like it while it was working. Fortunately, so far Amazon is making it easy to return. I am packing it in the new microwave box I just got today and will be shipping this back for a refund."
1,Died within two months.,"That's all. It died within two months. It's probably just a lemon, and they'll most likely replace it without a problem, but it sucks to have an appliance die. Its predecessor lasted eleven years.Beware. You may want to wait six months from the date of this posting to get out of this manufacturing batch."
1,worst customer service - they don't stand behind their product,"We bought a Panasonic microwave 1250W with inverter feature. After 4 years, the magnetron tube died. The tube was under warranty, but Panasonic said they would charge $87 for labor. Guess what the game is? dissuade the customer from proceeding further because labor is not covered. I complained to the NJ Attorney General's office but the Panasonic head office would not budge. I paid up to get it repaired. Now 6 months later, the turntable rotates whenever the door is opened, even when the microwave is not started. I called Sullivan at Panasonic but nobody returned my call.Unfortunately, only Sharp makes microwaves other than Panasonic. Be prepared for very poor customer service."
1,Toss up,Died on day 2.5. Previous Panasonic oven was still working after 10 years when this one replaced it. Would like to give the benefit of doubt to Panasonic due to that experience. Ordered replacement.Amazon customer service is fantastic. Return shipping is so much easier than manufacturer warranty repair process - Panasonic requires customer to bear shipping both ways for repair.
1,Power Hungry,This Microwave MUST be on a circut by itself ! we have 2 20 amp circuts in out condominium. Nothing else can be on when the microwave is running on full power or it trips the circut breaker. This becomes really annoying.
1,Broken Door Latch,The door latch on my microwave was broken on delivery. I have exchanged the item but I am skeptical that the latch may break easily with wear in the future.
5,good looking-good cooking,this microwave cooks food very evenly-no need to stir. i think it is the best looking black one out right now.
1,Disappointing,"Looks good, but reliability is a disaster. First one I received had a slash on the glass door. Amazon took it back and the next one would not run properly. Had a variatable motor noise. Sent back and Amazon would not send me a new one, since they were having too many problems with the unit. So I bought a GE. and it works great. Also, the GE buttoms for express use are much more usable than the Panasonic. Finally, future realibily with the GE looks a lot more promising the with the Panasonic."
4,"Very good microwave, just missing one feature","Great microwave, large interior without taking up too much counter space. Heats at least twice as fast as my old one. My only complaint is you cannot use the timer and cook something at the same time. I used to use the timer to keep track of what I have on the stove or in the oven, while I heated up the veggies (or whatever) in the microwave. I bought a small kitchen timer, so problem solved. But it was a bit inconvenient, since I've had this feature on my previous 2 microwaves."
1,If history serves us well...,"I purchased the Panny PT50-LC13, also a rear projection LCD HDTV, several years ago. Unfortunately, Panasonic will not stand behind its products. Do yourself a favor and google for past experiences of Panasonic rear-projection LCD TV owners before spending your hard-earned dineros.KW: PT50LC13, class action, lamp"
3,Not as good as I had expected...,"In my excitement over ""Do Right,"" I eagerly purchased this cd, hoping the rest of the tracks would be equally amazing and upbeat. Personally, other than ""Lazy Boy Dash,"" the rest of the tracks are rather slow paced, dull, and repetative. If you liked ""Do Right,"" you would probably be better off finding a single somewhere, or if you're REALLY curious, listen to a friend's cd before spending your money. This cd is definitely not what I'd expected. Though I wouldn't be surprised to hear ""Lazy Boy"" on the radio soon."
3,It's great to here the Shack again!!,"Jimmies Chicken Shack is one of the best live shows you will encounter these days. They have changed their sound on the newest release, but it sounds really good. Make sure if you purchase this cd to include, Pushing the Salmanilla Envelope, in your basket. Then the listner can appreciate the diverse sounds Jimmie Haha creates with the band."
2,Not up to par for a great band!,"This album while good is not what it could be. I have seen these guys many times and this album seems like a cop out. Listen to what some have said: they sound like 311(can't rap, can't play punk), Bare Naked Ladies but harder (""musicians"" that are tone deaf).This album does not sound like them. It doesn't have the passion of there past music. These guys have the talent to write better songs. Songs such as Trash & 30 Days are just an example of how they have not matured but have fallen into the black hole of pop music. The songs are good but the lyrics are stale. It's a disapointment from a band that has a persona way outside the music of this album."
4,I loved getting shacked,"The shack's new cd is wonderful. Songs like do right, string of pearls and trash really put you in a funky, rock-n-roll mood. A great album to listen to when youve had a hard day and need to chill out with a couple (of cases) of beer. 2 thumbs up."
5,A very unexpected love for this CD,I heard about Jimmies Chicken Shack on MTV. I saw their video. When I first saw it I thought they were some stupid band that wasnt going to make it at all and I actually hated them. But after I heard the whole song and some of their other songs I was hookes. They are and awesome band.
3,BEWARE OF DESCRIPTION,"I ORDERED THESE BECAUSE THE DESCRIPTION SAID THEY HAD SWEAT BANDS IN THEM.I SWEAT, SO I EXPECTED A SWEAT BAND THAT WOULD ABSORB MOISTURE. THE SWEAT BAND IN THESE PRODUCTS ARE AS THIN AS ONE LAYER OF A NYLON DRESS SOCK. I WOULD NOT CONSIDER THESE SWEATBANDS AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU."
2,decent,"The mounting style is what caught my eye. It has nice elevation above the finger. The stone has nice sparkle. The silver prongs add to the brightness of the stone. However the color of the gold is too much in the yellow/orange range to look 'real.' I know it's not real, but aren't we going for a good ""look a-like?"" Overall it is a decent cocktail ring."
5,A great book,"This book was enjoyable for me, especially since I'm just polishing up my own book of short horror stories. Every tale was unique in some way or another, but Christopher Pike really took the cake with his two-part story--highly original. I think this is one of the best collection of horror stories for young adult readers. Even though some stories may be just plain ""eerie"", that's what I like about them. They're entertaining."
2,An anthology with mediocre and decent horror stories,"This pocket book is fine for carrying on the bus--the stories are short and easy to read. However, the reader isn't always rewarded for the trouble. The intriguing cover promises 13 thrilling stories from 13 different authors of young fiction and this is an overstatement,at best. Granted, some of the stories are juicy, such as ""Blood Kiss"" and ""The Doll""; some of the images are eery, such as the deer. But as a whole, this is a disappointing book and some of the stories are not even as scary or interesting as eating Sunday breakfast. Instead of spending an hour on this book, spend the evening watching an episode of ""Unsolved Mysteries"""
1,Danielle Steel sappy soap,Forgot how tawdry the Danielle Steele movies were when I saw this film years ago. Wish I hadn't bought it. Won't make the mistake of purchasing one of her films again.
1,Inferior tape,"The tape arrived in only days, but when I opened the package I had been sold a broken tape that was rated by this seller as like new. It was not broken in route because there were missing pieces. This seller is deceitful."
4,Loss Turns to Gain,"Danielle Steel is a formula fiction writer. To know this, you only need to read two of her novels. First she makes her protagonist lose everything and then gain above and beyond what he/she lost. This can get rather irritating; however, this story was much more believable. Patrick Duffy and Lynda Carter work great together on screen. As for all you Ben Affleck fans, he's here too. A very YOUNG Ben. A great Sunday, romantic movie for men and women alike."
4,Pretty cool but you need to know how to use it.,"This is a really cool camera and has some fun things you can do with it. like frames around the persons face (like hearts) or you can make it black and white, or sepia. thats pretty neet.but you really need to know how to do the settings. if you set it on AUTO it takes 3-4 seconds to even take the picture. if you have it on AUTOp or no flash it works great. but if theres no flash, there seems to be no focus either so it comes out all shakey/blurry.The video quality is great.. no slowness or choppyness at all. sound quality is good too.i also like how you can record your voice over someones picture! or you can just record your voice if you want. once i took a picture of my mom sleeping and then i recorded her snoring.i have WAY too much fun with this phone and its effects. theirs way more than what i said and if your 13 like me, you will have lots of fun with it.overall, cool camera and i read alot of reviews on it before i got it and still like it."
3,Buy it if you want blurry pictures,"I got this camera as a X'mas gift for my wife, but every single picture was blurry on the right side of it. I liked the size, weight, red eye reduction among other features. But the quality and clearness of the picture was kind of poor for a 6MP camera. I have an Olympus FE-100 which is a 4 MP camera and I swear that it takes much better pictures than this one. SORRY SAMSUNG! But next time I will shop for a tradition name brand."
2,Great Camera,"Nice look, good feel, turns on fast, takes great pictures. Really great, with ridiculous depth of field and resolution, you can in no way appreciate how good the pictures will look on the LCD back, which is huge. So, what's my beef? Slow pictures, double flash, slow slow follow on shot, slow. Okay say cheese, one second, two seconds.... i only got thiis camera because I thought that problem was solved. Yes my battery is charged, no I do not see how to stop the problem other than no flash at all... where is one flash and let me worry about the red eye? slow- i hate it!!!!!! Still, its awsome, slick, and a fair price."
5,Great Live Album,I LOVE Dash Rip Rock. This is a great live album with all their old school songs. Would recommend to any fan of good old Southern rock and roll!!
4,Near Perfect Stupidity,"What more is there to say, really? I'd never heard of these guys when I saw them at Jazz Fest a few years back. Good God. Talk about a full-bore commitment to punkabilly lunacy. There is nothing like Dash Rip Rock. And this live CD easily reflects the beauty of the band's genius. (Yes, it is genius. You can't possibly be this gloriously inane with such consistency without having brains behind it.) I've never heard any of DRR's studio material, and I'm afraid to. From the guilty pleasure of ""Jambalya"" to the rollicking ode to ""white Lightning"" to the sheer stupidity of ""Save the Whales,"" go live and revel in the ridiculousness."
3,So-So tuner,"This tuner was not what I expected. The size is perfect for compact storage, but the tones produced are not accurate and made tuning a banjo extrememly difficult. We will be purchasing a regular sized chromatic tuner that will give better results. Chromatic tuners can be used for various stringed instruments, so if you have guitars and banjos, the chromatic may work for you also."
2,More of a toy than a tuner,"Although I have read some reviews of how accurate this item is for tuning, as a professional instrument maker and performer I must beg to differ. It is useful as a stocking stuffer for a budding musician, but truthfully it is a little flat of standard A=440 pitch. Also, it sounds a tone for you to tune against, and in anything other than a quiet room this is worthless... one is almost better off with a tuning fork against the sound box of your instrument. It is inexpensive and a novelty, but if you want a real tuner to rely upon, move onto to another tuner."
1,Farley's Pocket Tones Banjo Tuner.,Just a few words on the Farley's Pocket Tones Banjo Tuner. Don't wast your money. I sent mine back after 5mins of trying it. The tones arenot accurate.
4,Good product/Fair price,"What can I say other than good product, fair price, and very fast shipping. Thanks"
3,Everyday My Life - Dajae,"Australian CD Maxi Single Track Listing for""EVERYDAY MY LIFE"" - DAJAE1) Junior Jack Vocal Mix2) DJ Pierre Wild Pitch Mix Edit3) Cevin Fisher Awakening Mix4) Cevin Fisher Mad Percussion Mix Edit5) Cevin Fisher NYC Mix2001"
2,received broken - returned,"Overall, a very nice ring except for the broken piece of gold underneath the diamonds. Hard to explain but there are little bars that run underneath the diamonds and one was broken. Funny thing was there was a pen or ink mark on each side of the defect, as if somebody had seen it before. Very disappointed that amazon would send something like this out. Obviously we returned it."
1,The Author is a thief,"I bought this book and ""Nick Faldo In Perspective"" by John Hopkins. I read the Hopkins book first. When I started the Concannon book, I could see virtually the entire book covering Faldo's early life through 1985 was from the Hopkins book. Concannon wasn't just paraphrasing, he literally used Hopkins' work-word for word. I hope Hopkins filed a lawsuit for this thievery. Shame on Virgin for publishing this book."
4,TRUE FRIENDS,"THIS WAS A GREAT MOVIE,ABOUT FRIENDS WHO STAY TOGETHER THROUGH THEIR CHILDHOOD ALL THE WAY UP TO FATHER HOOD.AND THE HEARTBREAKS THEY GO THROUGH TO KEEP EACHOTHER CLOSE NO MATTER WHO TRIES TO GET IN THEIR WAY.A FRIENDSHIP THAT ONLY FEW PEOPLE WILL HAVE IN THEIR LIFETIME."
2,Lacking ion many ways,"I found this movie quit dragging towards the middle, painted a decent story but lacked in the middle as well as the acting felt like a bad tv movie. The dvd itself as well is lacking in any extras simply jsut has the movie and a few bios."
2,Better places to put your money,"Performances of Beethoven's complete string quartets by the Bartok, Medici, Vermeer, Lindsay, Alban Berg, Suske, Petersen, Alexander, and Tokyo Quartets all outshine that of the New Budapest. The New Budapest set is simply too bland. It is admirably recorded, but will be a bit thin for some tastes. There are too many better places to put your money."
5,Perfect Mix of Punk and Glam...,"...I hate to use tired labels, but it's true. You've got the flare and spunk of glammy rock (think New York Dolls, T-Rex, etc.) as well as the attitude and drive of early poppy punk (Buzzcocks, etc.)... it's absolute wonderful fabuliciousness. This is one of the best albums I own, and last I counted I had just over 1,500 CDs, so no small feat there. After listening to this CD, all I want to do is stir up s**t, but in the most stylish way possible. Lots of glitter invloved. If you like Siamese Dream era Smashing Pumpkins, especially ""Geek USA"" and ""Cherub Rock,"" or if you enjoy the crazy stuff off Nirvana's collection Incesicide (""Sliver,"" ""Son of a Gun,"" etc.), you ought to like this. Of course, Pop Heiress is Chainsaw Kittens' best album, and it is not available here. Alas. Still. Buy everything they've ever done. It's all great."
5,In the pantheon...,"Polyansky's performance of SYMPHONIC DANCES joins the Kondrashin/Amsterdam and the Temirkanov/St. Petersburg in the pantheon of truly great performances of this wonderful, sensual piece."
2,"Has potential, but the product support kills it","When you buy this kid, you expect to be able to do 3 things. Use the front panel, use the control remote, use the software, sadly, under windows vista, only the front panel works, everything else is forgotten by the Creative Labs team, and their customer support does nothing to solve it."
1,problem,"Buy it for my x-fi fatal1ty, and I took the surprise that the drivers do not work well, only works the front panel, but not the remote control and other functions. this happend in windows XP, and dont have solve from creative...."
5,Awesome,I want to start with that I bought this book from Amazon. I bought this book after reading a book by author Peter Hart on the battle of the Somme. Wow that was a great book. I will up date this review later as I read more. I am reading 4 books at the same time as well as working and study. I also want to state that this book is awesome. I rate it as a classic and must read for WWI history.
1,What Happened??,"I purchased the ""We Sign"" videos named: Fun Time, Play Time and Animals. They were perfect for my little ones' (12 to 24 Months) interest level and attention span.I was excited to get the next set of ""We Sign"" videos named: Numbers, Colors and More Animals. What a disappointment. We Sign changed the format, the singer (really bad) and characters. I thought they were terrible. So much so - I sent them all back at my own expense!!"
5,Gorgeous. This has become my favorite album,The sound quality on this album is good and the music is beautiful. I can sit and listen to it every day. It's also a good album to use while working.
4,Cheap mat works,"We received the dance mat for Christmas last year. For the kids, it works great. We haven't had problems with slippage or slow response (but then again we are amatures). I do think this is a good mat for a beginner."
5,very good value,"I have had this for over a dozen years. It has performed very well, and is a handy thing to have. I wish it was a little bigger for larger apples, but I work around this very slight short coming."
4,A bit of New Age spirit,"Much in common with Cusco, a bit like David Arkenstone, Kitaro is one of those New Age instrumentals artists you must add to your collection (if you collect New Age instrumental music). They aren't one of my real favorites of the genre, but I liked selections in this CD such as Sundance, Moondance, and especially Howling Thunder.This was my first Kitaro CD, and I hope to be trying some more."
4,Love it,"I have used the White Musk body shop oil for years and just wanted something similar I could use every day and pop into my handbag. This fit the bill. Its compact and fits into my purse and the cap goes on easily without risk of leaking.I see other reviewers saying the scent does not last long; however, I think it lasts just long enough. It really doesn't work for me to go around smelling strongly of white musk for hours on end and I honestly use it every day so I only use small amounts for just a hint of scent not a real bouquet.I do however, prefer the perfumed oil which if it just didn't leak out of the bottle when jostled around in my bag I would take over this any day - so not quite 5 stars."
2,"Slick, pretty, ultra-sanitized, disappointingly shallow","The book was so beautiful on the shelf that I had to buy it... Then I read the section on Curtis Turner. Ol' Curtis must have been a well-coifed choir boy, according to the way his life and driving record were presented. I leafed the rest of the book with its great photos, but that's about all there is... pretty pictures combined with a total lack of flavor. Someone at NASCAR should be ashamed of themselves..."
2,SPELL THE DRIVER'S NAMES CORRECTLY WOULD HELP,"The editorial review that list all 50 greatest drivers didn't spell 'RAY HENDRICK's name correctly. Ray's name is listed as, Ray Henrick.Please correct the Hendrick name, we are very proud of Ray and he has earned the right to at least be recognized as one of the 50 Greatest Drivers; at least you could spell his name correctly. At least give him that honor. Thank you, Mrs. Roy Hendrick"
3,So So,"Dishes work really well in the microwave but do not put the lids in the dishwasher, not even top rack. The lids no long fit on to the dishes, they shrank. Disappointing that I will have to put left-overs into another container & then return them to these items to reheat."
2,Smaller than Expected,"Seems like a fine product, but the dimensions are smaller than described in the ""Product Details"" and I was looking for something slightly larger in diameter."
3,"Great title song, but...","I've always thought it a little cheeky when movie soundtrack albums are released with only the title song - and a lot of filler. The Muse title song is a first class Elton John ballad, and there's two versions of it. But the rest of the tracks are forgettable background music."
5,Image drum (thats what it really is),It is what I need and it works like it's supposed to. It was delivered quickly. It is mislabeled as a toner cartridge is what this holds and it is always black
5,addictive and beautifully written tale,"I read some of the other reviews on this site and feel like I must have read a different book. I truly could not put David Prete's beautifully written debut novel down. The prose is lovely, the characters endearing. There was also a great deal of humor, especially when the protagonist describes his large Italian family and some of the more colorful characters of his Yonkers youth. I rank this novel right up there with Tobias Woolf's classic, This Boys Life, for its insights into the difficulties of growing up. Truly an impressive debut."
1,Try again!!,This book was fact more than fiction. David (or Joey) came from this Italian Family. I remember him at the young tender age when the book starts out and I went thru memory lane with this book. The names were changed but the incidents really happened. I lost interest 3/4 thru the book as I did not know him at that time of his life. He is to be given alot of credit to be able to come this far having published this book.
1,Not the people I knew,"Someone donated this book to the library where I am the librarian. As I grew up in Yonkers during the same time that the writer did, I perused it first with interest, and then with horror. What an insult to the people there! My family, my neighbors, friends and the community were not anything like this writer portrays. I hope that anyone that picks this book up realizes that it's the writer and his writing that is crass and classless. Don't waste a single minute of your reading time on this trash."
3,"Perfect, if only it fit...","This is a beautiful receiver that I have heard a lot of good feedback on. However, Amazon claimed a double din would fit my 07 Ranger, and I found out after getting it that it does not. Thus, I am out the shipping to and from as well as a 15% restocking fee, putting me out [...]"
1,the worst customer service ever,DO NOT BUY JVC. They have the wost coustomer service ever.They broke my car radio after it needed minor repair. It came back scratched up they broke the usb port & said to bad we didn't do it. They did I only used this radio for about 2 months. It now looks 15 years old.
2,Weak Strength,"I bought this item and was not satisfied with it. I will be sending it back even though they charge a 20% restocking fee which is horrible. The product is not tight fitting. It did not work well for me, kept moving and getting loose. I would not recommend it.Mighty Grip Shoulder Support For Left Shoulder, Sport Medicine/Safety"
5,10 Ton Porta Power Kit,The tool works well and you get all of the necessary attachments for multi-uses. The plastic case that the kit comes in does not support the kit well for travel during the shipping/receiving process. The first unit came with a completely destroyed inner case. The second unit came with some of the plastic covers broken as the pieces of the kit do not fit tightly into the molded sections.
2,No charts for information,This book has a nice story and pretty pictures. I wanted more. How about charts showing all the specs for the various years of the VFR ? There aren't any.
2,v-four fans,"NOT the book you want to buy if you are a lover of the honda intercepter street bikes. this is more for the ricky-racer sorts. very good photos of some street bikes and many great photos of competition and rare v-four machines. the competition history of the V-fours is well done if that is what your after (if so, you will appreciate this book more than i)."
4,"Ancient, but still handy","Our 1976 edition of this classic atlas is obviously very much out of date. Probably dozens of nations have come and gone in the intervening 30 years since it was published.Still, it's very handy to have a large world atlas around the house, to check the precise locations of towns and cities still not listed on the Internet. You'd be surprised."
3,"""Understanding"" Digital SLR's","I concur with another reviewer that Busch too frequently plugged his other books. I was annoyed with repeated comments ""but I won't go in to that here, I addressed it in my previous book XYZ.""That said, ""Mastering Digital SLR Photography"" did provide a good understanding of how Digital SLR's are different from both digital nonSLR and film SLR cameras. He addressed techniques to take advantage of features found on the leading DSLR's as well as common problems that future technology may overcome. He provided a decent overview of the crop vs. full frame sensor issue.Overall, the book it a decent book and an easy read but it is best described as an introduction, not a mastering of anything. If you are an intermediate film SLR photographer, you may find some value in Busch but will more probably be bored except for a couple chapters."
3,"A decent book, but not exactly what I was looking for","I bought this book in an attempt to ramp up my DSLR skills. I really need to understand how I can improve my pictures by properly using my new dslr. The trouble I had with this book is that he spends a lot of time explaining in great detail the mechanics of the camera. Although I recognize that it is important to understand what is going on inside my camera, at this point it is more important for me to better understand how to optimally use my camera.One thing that stood out to me is how awful the photos in the book are. I'm not sure if it is a printing issue, but I have taken better shots with my point and click. I'm surprised nobody else has mentioned this."
4,Great Book!,This book is great with clear and concise pictures documenting all. The only gripe I have I that I skipped over a significant portion of the beginning of the book. The first part of the book discusses vintage photgraphy equipment and film. Not exaclty what I was looking for in a DSLR book...
3,Good but there are some better.,"This book was helpful but there are better books out there. It's good and helpful, I've just found better."
5,"Excellent, detailed description of DSLR concepts","This is quite a heavy read, but David Busch has done a great job of explaining complex issues in easy to comprehend terms. In this book, he refuses to gloss over any details and consequently arms the reader with a deep understanding of photography's ""first principles"".One minor criticism would be that this is a very long book. That may be an inevitable consequence of covering so much ground in such detail, but at times I felt he might have shortened some of the sections without losing any of the insight. Nevertheless, this was a great introduction for me and whetted my appetite to experiment and to try to develop some photography skills.If you want a much simpler table of settings for different needs, try Scott Kelby's digital photography books. If you want a detailed understanding of the concepts behind those settings, read this."
2,not helpful for beginners,"This book was touted as ""the book"" for beginners in digital photography. It is anything but! The technical content is undoubtedly excellent but the nitty gritty, easy to understand material is just not included. The book claims to have beautiful, full color sample photographs and yes they are there. However, what the beginner needs is how were these samples taken, what f stop and aperture were used and why. This information is sadly lacking. While I am a serious amateur and have been shooting film for many years, i am just starting my digital slr experience and expected far more out of this book than I rec'd.Edward F. Garrepy"
2,Mastering Digital SLR Photography,"As a owner of a new Canon 20D. I was looking for acomprehensive book on tips & techniques unique todigital SLR cameras. My first experience withphotography was 1980 when I bought a Canon A1. Atwhich time I would glean through photographybooks & magazines to discover how to be more creativewith my camera. My experience also includes computerswhen I get a program I would get comprehensive bookson tips & techniques unique to that program (some withthe title starting with Mastering * etc) which werevery comprehensive.This book is not, it should be called ( A Buyers GuideTo Know If Digital SLR Cameras Are Right For You ).But you will need to look at other reviews for specificson each camera. For this book's resounding theme is thecomparison between a point & shoot digital & a SLR digitalcamera."
3,Mastering the slr camera,"This book is very informative for an amateur. Too much detail on the technical workings of the camera. I would like to have seen more examples of composition, depth of field ,etc but I don't think it was designed to be that type of book. It is a great reference tool when trying to understand the components that make of a slr camera."
2,Not much is there to master,"If you are a newbie to digital photography and want to know some technical aspects of it, this is a good reading. But if you are used to point-and-shoot digital and has learn enough to know your way around, you're better off searching the internet. This is more like a compilation of what is out there on the web - just saves you time searching. Read and understand your manual (because that is what this book says) and do research and practice - that is how you master not by just sitting and reading."
5,This cd is the best,I loved this cd they have all differnt types of songs like dance and pop. I love the t.v show and it includes all the songs like two in a million and s club and I really miss you.You should diffently buy this
3,is it cool? or not?,i've waited for the new episodes about ten years.thank GOD they came out! i don't like unfinished things!for the old fans i think that they will be dissapointed.the new characters don't have the charm and the originallity of the old characters.the english voices are the same from the old episodes but only ryokos voice is a little bit changed :-(in general the new fans will find it interesting.the old fans as i said will be dissapointed but Tenchi is TENCHI!it will always be one my favourites.
3,"First part is great, the second part isn't so hot...","So I waited, waited for years, and finally the new epsiodes came out. The first few episodes were great, fit nicely into the world established previously...and the characters were great.Sadly, about halfway...things take a nose dive.I sat through the last three or so epsiodes and while they had moments that were nice, over all they were a large disappointment.The epic battle expected...isn't there. Its as if the writers got to the fight and realized they had nothing left. The plot suddenly falls apart, becoming disjointed and rather...confusing.Over all I say a solid three stars, maybe 3 and a half. Still a good series over all, fans should get enough enjoyment from the good episodes to justify buying this."
2,only two games,"There are apparently two versions of Mega Pinball. Don't confuse the Mega Pinball (Jewel Case) edition from Casual Arcade with this product. ""Snap! Mega Pinball"" from Topics Entertainment only includes the first two boards, Monsters Rhapsody and Crystal Tower. The last entry, Dragon Slayer!, is disabled by making it impossible to enter a ball into play. Not a big loss though, since the first two games aren't that interesting."
1,"Durable, but crap","if you actually want to play airsoft don't buy this gun, this was the first gun i bought, and i bought it almost two years ago, but its total crap. It barley fires 125 fps, and you literlayy can not hid the borad side of a barnfrom 20 feet away. I have willing fire this gun at my slef point blank, as a demonstration to my freind of how littl eit hurts. dont buy this product"
3,Egocentric Chronicles,"I bought this book for light reading while traveling this summer. I understand that most of the pieces were put together for publications like New Yorker, Harper's, etc. But really, I think we could live without all the gratuitous name-dropping and constant self-loathing references to her weight problem. In addition Ms. Wasserstein makes it clear, through her sublimated anger, that she carries a grudge because she didn't realize her true potential as a female until she was grown. Hey, me too! It's the same old song, having to re-learn the rules of life as a woman with brains. Hey, me too! Get over it. If she would just get on with the stories, without the long and tedious set-up they might be amusing. But the road she takes us on is an old one. We women have all been down that road and back. Life goes on... Too bad she uses such references as crutches to prop up a lack of cutting edge wit and wisdom. Dorothy Parker, she ain't. This was a book I had a hard time picking up."
2,Sports Case Review,"This is the only case I found for the Sony Digital Walkman. My husband and I both have one. I like it because I can clip it on and I feel the walkman is protected. But my husband thought the case was too tight. It is difficult to press the walkman's buttons and when you remove the walkman from the case, the silver cap sometimes comes off and gets stuck."
5,Wow!,"The three previous reviews are excellent, so I just want to comment two pints:1.- Mr. Hamelin was in Mexico city recently in October 2000, and his playing is fantastic. My favourit pianist along with Mr. Leslie Howard2.- Mr. Hamelin should play this works in his performances, that way Catoire will start to get the recognition he deseves.Buy it."
4,Pretty good,"I have only played it a few times, but my husband seems to like it. He does mixed martial arts, and said the game seemed to mimic real-life martial arts quite well."
3,Best UFC game on Market,"This is best UFC game on the market, but I think that there is a lot of room for improvement. I didn't expect this game to be amazing, but I think after a couple more releases a great one will come on the horizen."
2,Too easy,"I usually don't write reviews, but I am just too dissatisfied with this game. Having played UFC Throwdown and Pride FC for the PS2, I was expecting more from UFC Sudden Impact.Pros:- There are more fighting styles available than in the previous version for creating a fighter.- The new side mount, fence mount, and long range positions add variety to the fight.Cons:- Adjustments can't be made after completing a created fighter's training, unlike in Pride FC where your fighter is FULLY customizable.- Even at the hardest level, the computer controlled fighters don't know how to block.Overall, if you like fighting against walking punching bags, buy UFC Sudden Impact. If you like a challenge and create your own fighter, buy Pride FC."
2,Recycle plots! Save the planet!,"Hmm. The Helmacron were a filler idea in the first place, and I was disappointed to see that the Ghostwriter hired by KAA couldn't come up with anything more original. Also, the trip to Snot Mountain in MarcoLand smacked of The Magic School Bus. Happily, most of the biology seemed to be factual, props to GW for that. I would've liked to have seen more plot advancement, for both the Yeerks and the war, and the blossoming relationships between our angst-filled heroes. My two stars are for the fact that it was quite funny, especially Rachel's disgust at swimming in Marco's bodily fluids, but I had to take away points for the Rabies subplot. Worth a read if it's a rainy Saturday, but that's about it."
1,Not good!,I noted that beef is not even an ingredient in thie Aujus and it tasted like it. I threw the whole bottle away and we had beef sandwiches with out the Aujus.
5,Charlie Battery...a must read,"Charlie Battery is a must read by any father who has a son deployed, especially a father of a Marine.The remarkable point about this book is that it is factual and is about the actual players in the events. It is so well written that one could use it as a historical reference. Andrew Lubin has done a remarkable job of explaining the details of this particular artillery unit and its part in the battle of An-Nasiriyah.JERSEY ANGEL"
1,We Sign Numbers,"I purchased the ""We Sign"" videos named: Fun Time, Play Time and Animals. They were perfect for my little ones' (12 to 24 Months) interest level and attention span.I was excited to get the next set of ""We Sign"" videos named: Numbers, Colors and More Animals. What a disappointment. We Sign changed the format, the singer (really bad) and characters. I thought they were terrible. So much so - I sent them all back at my own expense!!"
1,level or not level?,"Quality is lacking in this level. Starrett apparently knows this because the tool came with a note saying they cannot make this tool's legs square (90 degrees) at this price. It is true that the two legs of this level are not square to each other (it rocks on a square corner) -- in fact, it's not even that close to square (and short legs are easier to make square than long legs). Since the legs are not square to each other, this means the level vials cannot be accurate either.The tool's name is ""cross test level and plumb"" but if the vials are not at 90 degrees to each other, then it cannot test level and plumb. Maybe one of these vials is parallel to its leg, but they cannot BOTH be parallel. Cannot recommend this tool."
