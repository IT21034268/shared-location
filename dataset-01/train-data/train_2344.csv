2,A Waste of Time,"I had read most of the Princess Diaries books and enjoyed them when this one came out and my friends and I decided to read it. I didn't like it at all. The story was pretty boring and the main character seemed like almost the exact replica of the girl in Princess Diaries. It was too alike for me and all the characters were pretty one-sided. The writing also was not very good. The one thing that could have saved it was the two sisters in the story who made it interesting, but they couldn't make up for the rest of such a bad book."
4,Cool,"It was great but it has words like a little inappropriate for kids. Better buy if you are 20 years or over. But overall, great!"
5,The true all american girl,"This was such a cute/good book that any teenage girl who is into romance and politics and learning about life, will love. This is deffinately the type of book that when you've finished reading it, makes you look back at the accomplished pages read and let out a long hardy sigh at how great and heartfelt the book was. I think every teenage girl can relate to the main character in one way or another, wheather its her love of music(gwen stefani;ska) or her love of art, or her individuality, every girl can find something to relate to. So if you like feel good books that also make you think, you will love ""All American Girl"". If this review did nothing to convince you, maybe the fact that the author is also the author of the Princess Diaries series, and if you are a fan of them, you'll LOVE this book. Samantha has one thing in common with Mia and thats her wit.READ IT, YOU'LL LOVE IT!!!"
4,"Fun read, impressive teen book","Fast-paced, satisfying read and better than a lot of books I have read lately that are for adults.This books reminds me of my teen years of a book called ""The President's Daugher"" (out of print..can't find it!!!).Good: pacing, you really feel like you are in Sam's head, realistic love interest/boyfriend, scene settingBad: some repetition of basic themes, references to No Doubt that will not stand the test of timeFinal: Great read, worth buying"
2,Out of the Blue - Out of the Past,"This book was not what I expected. It is a compilation of radio and TV reviews from the 1947-1951 period, and mildly interesting for those with a knowledge of the public personalities of that era. However, I was expecting more historical and/or biographical information on the radio and TV stars of that transitional period between radio and TV."
1,What happened?,"I really like Amazon, I have a Kindle and love it. This was my first streaming video from Amazon and not only was a I disappointed, the movie is simply not working now. I will continue to love the company. But I'll wait for the technology to work on streaming videos."
2,Did not live up to my expectations,"First off, the movie is filmed like its a reality show. Think Paranormal Activity. I found his very annoying. The previews all touted, from the makers of Training Day. I really liked Training Day, and this is not in Training Day's league. The story is simplistic and disjointed with an unsatisfactory ending. I hoped for more from this movie and it was consistently disappointing."
2,Deplorable,"I have absolutely no idea how this movie is rated so highly. Personally, I found the acting at times to be ridiculous. I would give specific examples (especially the ending scenes) but do not want to spoil anything for people who have not seen it.If you want the average American movie that is action driven and you want to burn a couple of mind-numbing hours, go for it. If you are looking for a compelling film with any depth at all, avoid this movie.I also found the persistent first person camera view annoying. At times it felt like the Blair Witch project with badges."
2,Pointless movies with never ending 1st person perspective,"This movie is very, very long. There is a lot of character development, but no actual story and for some reason EVERYONE in the film is recording themselves. There is a good bromance vibe and some great one-liners, but it's wasted because there is no point - have I mentioned there is no point to this movie? There is no point. There are several almost points: a rookie, a bitter old cop, human trafficking, a romance, the Mexican cartel, and a mysterious commando team who might be interesting.Don't waste your money or your time: you've always wanted to learn to play guitar, right? Work on that tonight, instead."
4,I was going to leave room while this was on,because I didn't like the beginning. For some reason I stayed with it and became totally engrossed. I was still thinking about it days later after I watched it.
2,Not Impressed,"I was looking forward to this movie as it kept being referred to as a Training Day like movie which I did enjoy. This is not the case with this movie. Story line is awful and how these two inept cops keep literally walking in on these major drug finds is a major flaw. Okay one I can believe but they keep finding these major drug houses literally just by walking up to them. Not a good movie, not a good story line. Skip It."
3,Good story/Immature characters,"I like this movie overall, but it was a little hard to stomach sometimes. I know Hollywood is Hollywood, but after being in the military, it's hard not to take certain movies more seriously. I don't expect real life from a lot of movies, but the thing that gave me pause on this one was the main characters. I think that if I were real-life LAPD, I would hate this movie. The two main characters seemd highly immature for their profession and took a ton of liberties that would have had them off of the force in a heartbeat. While I know that is half the point of the film, it was just a little hard for me to feel honor for these two at the end."
2,Skip this one,Silly and confusing plot. The film could have been run in reverse and it would not have made a difference. The acting was barely!
3,End of Watch Review,This was a pretty good action movie. There are slow stretches where the partner relationship is shown. This movie has A LOT of curse words. (If this is the sort of thing that bothers you.)I felt the drug cartel part of the movie took a backseat to the cop partnership part of the movie. It should have been done the other way around.
3,Decent,"This movie was decent. It had its moments with engaging scenes, but for the most part it did not keep my attention. I hated the ending."
3,Odd movie,"If it was supposed to be ""a day in the life"" sort of thing, it was a bit over the top (at least from the cops I've been friends with). The whole documentary-style camera thing was odd, and the acting was quite stilted (especially given the actors). If they were trying to portray the brotherhood of cops (sort of the way the movie starts and ends), they fell short."
4,Great movie bad ending,Great movie but the end is dissappointing. good acting and I liked the home movie feel but it was a little nauseating at times
4,action all the way,"Not much plot, just two cops who have really bonded going about their business, packing more tense situations into a couple of hours than most cops experience in two lifetimes. Good likable cast. Great, palm-sweating escape."
4,Good movie,The movie took awhile to get to the real action. Otherwise it was a great potrayal of two officers on daily patrol.
2,slow.,I was not really at the edge of my seat. I was actually waiting for something to happen. Ending is too hard-to-believe for a movie that at times feels like a documentary.
4,End of Watch,"The movie was good, had its exciting parts. People say its ""real life,"" its not, its all Hollywood! This kind of crap gets everyone killed."
3,"eh, not bad",This movie is not a waste of two hours of your life... but I would be fine if I never saw it.
1,"weak, unpleasant","First, this movie gained very little from it's POV shooting style, and it added little to their ability to tell a story.The final third of the movie really didn't make much sense. Why did the street gang go after these two regular patrol officers? What did they hope to gain? Didn't they understand the risk they would be taking? And after the two officers left the apartment where they took shelter, why did they continue to hunt down their attackers (even though they were clearly outgunned), instead of trying to hide and protect themselves until help arrived?Overall, a single typical episode of the TV series Southland is much better than this movie, giving more meaningful stories about the lives of LA police officers (with stronger characterization)."
5,AWESOME,"this was actually the best movie I've seen in a long time, just a really good all around movie! Its a buyer!!"
3,"Great movie, disappointing ending",*SPOILER ALERT* This reminds me of the old Bollywood movie Sholay. It's a great movie but the ending could have definitely been better.
2,Camera movement causes motion sickness,Too much movement on the filming. The camera movement could give someone motion sickness. The story line was so so!
4,Really likied this movie and watched it twice,Reall liked this movie as it was funny and sad both!Was shocked at the ending and wasnt really expecting that at the end of movie.Watched it a cpl of times and really liked it!
4,A really good police movie,"I read a lot of good things about this movie and they are all true. Apart from certain sections that depict gang members, nothing felt cliched. And given that this is from the cop buddy movie genre, there is plenty of scope for cliched scenes. Pena and Gyllenhaal have 'lived' their parts. The performances are great and I was left with a lot of appreciation for what cops in tough neighborhoods have to go through."
4,Loved it!,"This movie was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I felt like I was actually there, that's how real it felt. The acting was so real it was like watching 2 real officers on duty. Great movie. I will definitely buy it."
4,Awesome movie,"Loved this movie.Characters had great chemistry,good storyline.Did not care for the way the movie ended but Overall this was a fantastic movie."
5,MUST WATCH,"GREAT ACTORS AND ACTRESS, ALL IN ALL IT WAS AN AMAZING MOVIE IT IS A MUST SEE!! SO WATCH IT TODAY!!!"
4,"Excellent, gritty, LA cop movie","This movie reminds me of the movie ""Colors"", only updated to present day. There is a bit of ""Adam 12"", ""Colors"", ""Training Day"", all mixed together and updated. Well done, and understated with the handheld camera techniqued. Keeps you glued to the screen, all the while developing the relationship between the two LAPD cops on patrol. Definitely a must-see."
3,Okay,Wanted to like it but the story was just too predictable and the links with the cartel were poorly done.
4,"Exciting, but..","There was no actual plot to the story/movie. There was some fun moments. Even some moments where it catches your intentions and emotions, BUT... as a whole, it was a ok movie. What I do like about this movie is how different it is compared to others in this genre. It brings you down to the 'human-side' of officers and that they are just like average people, but in a difficult position of ""profession"". Another thing I like (and a bit dislike I might add) is the camera angles throughout the movie. Some where fun and interesting seeing where and what the director was going for (and why).Overall I'll give this a 7.5 out of ten. A nice rental."
1,Overly vulgar,"At the recommendation of well known reviewers, I ordered this movie for our library. We didn't even finish watching the film. It had no storyline. It was overly vulgar with no purpose for the film. These two fine actors are worth much more than this film. It was horrible. Returned for refund."
1,Foul Mouthed,"In my 73 years, 28 in the military, I've never encountered so much foul language, it is embarrassing to listen to.If you think dialogue should consist of of words more than four letters long and or beginning with F, S, MF, etc. Don't buy this thing. As for the plot?????"
1,waste of time,This was a waste of time no plot and too much profanity. the opening cjade screen was the best part of this whole movie.
5,Great one here.,"Really enjoyed this movie. If you know someone in law enforcement or you are in law enforcement, then you will enjoy this movie."
3,hate these type of movies feels like im watching 3d movie at theater,"cloverfield, parnormal activity, blair witch project 1 i hate movies that filmed like through actors point of view first movie i watched like that was blair withc project ever since then every movie i watch that has been filmed through actors point of view shaky cam crap puts me asleep i feel sleep through paranomral activity 1 becasue of how it was filmed i gave this film 3 stars its good movie i would have gave it 4 or 5 it was filmed in non shaky cam if you like parnormal activity, clover filed, movies like that you will like this movie."
4,A surprisingly good movie,"I didn't have much expectations for this move it be honest, the TV trailers made it look like a just another cop movie a la Training Day (not that there is anything wrong with that) but I am a bit jaded of those. To my delight and surprise the movie turned into a very good movie that despite its ""buddy cop"" influences. The performances of both leads Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Peña (with an always delightful Anna Kendrick) are simply stunning, and the ""reality show"" camera movement and angles gives the movie a really kinetic feel where you never feel lost in what is going on and it is exciting and dynamic. The premise of the movie is simple, a pair of LA cops, whose relationship goes beyond the job is he backdrop for an overreaching plot where both cops are targeted by a Mexican cartel. It looked like a popcorn movie but it turned out to be surprisingly well done, with some great performances all around and highly recommended."
2,End of Watch,"It had a good cast, but we were distracted by the ""hip hop at all costs"" vibe. Story line was just ok"
2,Didn't like it at all,Couldn't watch the movie because the picture so dark that you can barely see whats going on in the movie except the audioHad to stop watching the movie less than half way
4,raw feel,great cop movie that didn't feel fake....had a very raw edginess to it but a lot of sensibility at the same time as well
4,Good Movie,I really enjoyed this film. Would have liked a different ending but overall it was a good good movie. I would recommend this movie to my friends.
5,Best cop movie I have seen in a long time.,"Although I hate movies that use the premise of the characters filming the movie as a ""project"" or whatever lame reason they want to come up with for the perspective they want to shoot the film from, I enjoyed this film from the beginning to the bitter end.The writer, director and actors catch the banter and camaraderie of the partners very well. For once, Hollywood portrays the police as normal people trying their best to do the right thing, not thugs no better than the ones they chase.A great movie that has become one of my favorites."
3,Bad Language,This movie is filled with about a million F-bomb's and too much blood and gore. Story line would make for a good movie but got tired quickly of the language. Trailers didn't capture the carnage depicted in the movie.
1,Horrible movie!,Horrible movie! I spent the entire movie waiting on it to get good. Don't waste your money on this one.
1,Horrible!,Probably one of the worst movies I have ever encountered. No discernible story line or plot. Characters who could not be identified with and language that hurt the ears.
1,Absolutely Horrible,"You know a script has gone south when every other word is the ""f"" word. The writers overloaded the ""f"" word using it as a noun, verb, adverb and I believe a conjunction. I know this is supposed to be a gritty film. But it was hard to tell the plot because the writing was so poor. We gave up after 15 minutes. This movie went directly to the trash."
1,awful,Just full of cliches. Terrible. Dialogue wants so badly to be considered authentic - its dying to be the movie that 26 year old cops go see with their guy friends. I couldn't get all the way through it.
3,Bad acting.,"Not only they don't act as cops, but it's not their best acting in a movie. The ending is weird, right after a sad scene it goes into a hilarious ending."
2,Too much foul language,"I think they dropped the ""F"" bomb over 100 times. Ending was terrible as well. This movie had potential but they were not able to deliver."
3,The best of the moive is what you see in the trailer,"Ok, but I expected more action and more from both of these actors but the script just flip flopped from personal to action, back to personal... Expected something similar to Colors or Training Day but no where near as good."
2,"A ""home movie"" about the LAPD","This movie has the look and feel of a home movie about a day in the life of 2 LAPD officers (Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Penna). In that regard, it reminded me of the award-winning, war movie ""Hurt Locker"". Overall, I felt it lacked dramatic impact. It's not the kind of movie had wanted watch their"
1,Not what I thought,I should have passed on this on. It kept freezing and starting over. I thought it was my Internet but It did the same thing on my tablet.
5,Intense!!,"Girls - this one probably isn't for you. But, if you loved Training Day - watch this movie. Michael Peña is superb."
2,Typical Cop Drama,"No surprises, a typical buddy/cop drama. I'm glad I watched this movie before purchasing it. For folks who love the genre, it will be 3 stars."
3,A Friendship's Bond.,"A gripping tale of two police officers whom share a close bond as friends/brothers in LA fighting and trying to keep peace in the streets go up against tough mobsters and hit-men/women . However the filming and panning is terrible as it constantly moves in and out too fast ... the angles also isn't where one really looks at . This happens all through the movie and therefore causes one to have a massive headache. So if you GET headaches easily or motion sickness then beware as this movie, it will do it."
3,Action Action Action,this movie brings fire to the screen. Just wish they had made the ending last longer. I had to watch the movie twice to get a clear understanding.
3,Good flick!,Good flick but I almost turned it off because of the continued foul language in parts. Is that really necessary?
3,Ok but not what I expected,Doesn't live up to the marketing. Ok movie but I didn't expect a hand-cam Documentary style film. Catch it on sale and enjoy.
2,Movie review,"The movie was realistic, but kept changing dates so you had to watch carefully to keep up with what segment of time you were in."
3,Tough day for beat cops,"Contains a lot of gritty and probably realistic action, but to me very unrealistic that a police force would allow two junior cops to film anything (once the word got around that they were doing that)."
2,15 minutes at the end of the movie is great but the rest..well,"I had heard about this movie and was looking forward to watching it but with the exception of the action scene near the end, this movie was a disappointment. I personally hate the type of movies that film from the perspective that it is not a movie and it is just the guys taping themselves. The camera work ruins this movie for me, terrible angles and the whole I am carrying a camera while I raid a house thing is so unrealistic it is laughable. The story could have been so much more, but the dialogue was poor as well. The plot had a lot of potential but fell far short. If you can handle the camera issues then you might rate this higher but if you dislike the self filming type of thing, then you will be disappointed as well."
4,Insight to being a police officer in LA,"Unique movie in the way it was photographed to tell the story of two police officers and the bond they developed. If the incidents are half way accurate in what LA police officers are having to deal with today, this country has real big problems ahead with the drug cartels, etc."
4,END OF WATCH,it reminded me of home. sure glad i dont live there. the police have a hard road. end of watch good acting.
3,worth renting/watching. not buying,"worth renting or watching once or twice but not buying at full price. starts off with action from the beginning & slows down then speeds back up then, keeps slowing down"
2,Mehhh...,Good Acting.. Story not so much. Writers couldve done a better job with the last 20 minutes of the film.
5,end of life,i can imagen thats 4 real and there are a lot of people that dont understand thelife of a cop
2,Very bad ending,"Most of the movie was about the building of a friendship ande how two lucky cops kept stumbling onto crime scenes which provided amazing drug bust slavery rings etc. Totally unrealistic. But the biggest disappointment was the ending. What a load of crap!! Bottom line, don't waste your money!"
2,Not what I expected,The story and acting was great. The video was atrocious. I know they were trying to get the home video effect going but it just ruined the whole movie. It was like watching a bad episode of COPS
3,It's okay,"Lots of plot holes and questions that left someone looking for a more layered movie a bit disappointed. Acting is phenomenal and the chemistry of all the actors, especially Gyllenhall and Pena, is top notch. The supporting roles are also very good. There were just parts that didn't make complete sense, and i felt like it decreased the quality of the movie. Overall, the action and the acting make it very compelling, but this seems like the kind of movie people will either love or hate."
4,Realistic and moving cop story,If you can get past the shaky-documentary camera treatment -- which is authentic but sometimes annoying -- this is a well-done story of two beat cops in south-central L.A. whose trust and love for each other relationship fuel their effectiveness and risk-taking on the job. Jake Gyllenhaal was good but the under-rated Michael Pena gave an outstanding performance.
4,"good movie , hated the camera.","I thought it was a movie that everyone would have enjoyed even more if the camera angles were more steady ... Story was good and acting was well done. .. Over all , im glad I saw it."
5,Well done though little known,Excellent film. The cast and script both first rate. I am surprised this film did not receive more attention as it is better than many splashier productions.
4,Good movie,This was a good movie started a little slow but overall good movie. I didn't care for the ending of this movie.
5,Excellent,Great acting!!!! Just like watching a documentary. A must see especially if you are a fan of crime/suspense. I was very surprised that the film did not get more critic appraise.
5,"Bushido Code, LAPD style","Hard-hitting, documentary-style realism, tight dialogue, technically sound, to-the-letter LAPD protocol and procedure, and a street gang element portrayed with frightening authenticity, make End of Watch one of the best cop films since Dennis Hopper's ""Colors"". Complimented by an equally strong wingman turn from Jake Gyllenhaal, this is Michael Pena's breakthrough performance. End of Watch gives new insight into life on the ""thin blue line"". A must-see, especially for cop movie fans."
3,not what I expected,From the reviews and previews I could not wait to watch this movie so I purchased it when it came out. What a mistake it was I do not want to spoil it for the people that have not seen it yet. But the movie is not what it seems but it was stil not a bad movie just the story line could be better. When I said it was a mistake buying it I meant I should had just waited to rent it. But the things that happen and how the police acted is actually right I grew up blocks ftom the lapd newton station where the movie was based and filmed around so it was a pleasure seeing the streets I grew up in. Maybe I wanted to see more violence more crimes.
1,Could not play on TV,COULD NOT PLAY ON TV. 12MG CONNECTION AND WOULD NOT PLAY ON TV.COULD NOT PLAY ON TV. 12MG CONNECTION AND WOULD NOT PLAY ON TV.
2,Disappointed,"Maybe I was expecting too much. The big tag line is this is from the director (I think) of Training Day, which I think is VERY good. I love good cop dramas/action movies. While I think both of the main actors were great, the film bored me. So, for ME, this was a major fail.Rent first (which I didn't...shame on me)."
1,could not get past the first half hour!,Terrible!Boring.Stupid.Sad to have actually spent money on this movie! BOMB. What was I thinking? JUST SAY NO
1,The TV show COPS on steroids,"This show was horrible , trying to show the life of two cops doing impossible things. my whole family are police and they also thought the movie was a joke. save your money this was a joke."
1,horrible,not worth even five minutes of your time. painful to watch. cannot believe these actors are in this. can i have my dollars back?
1,Hated how it was filmed,"What bothered me most was the filming style. If I want to watch jerky home movies, I'll watch my own. Well, actually, mine are filmed better than that.For more than half the movie it was boring and nothing happened.And jumped around a lot which made following the plot difficult.It just wasn't a smooth professional looking movie."
1,Truly a waste,"This is a movie that had so much potential. It has a good line-up of stars, but the story lacked a plot. I usually LOVE movies of this genre, but this in all manner was at the bottom of the stack."
2,Seriously?,"Personally I thought this was drivel, the dialogue is laughable, bad guys/girls are hams - Jake Gyllenhaal is, as usual, good, but he can't save it. Officer III (a rank just below Sergeant it seems) goes off on some anal sex rant to which the correct response would be ""are you having mental problems?"" and to get him back on his meds pretty quick. It takes a seriously strong stomach to handle the little speech Gyllenhaal is saddled with as the movie opens - I can paraphrase it as ""cops are the most amazing people in the world and also a bit like Terminators"". Yes... well... kinda clashes with the later sentiment (borrowed from Southland) that its the only way someone with no real education can earn a half decent wage. The moron who wrote this knows the world through TV and movies and, in my opinion, have never actually been out in it. Lame."
2,Over-acted and under-written,"I can see what they were aiming for, but it missed the mark. Way too much meaningless and vapid backstory, a very slow start, extended scenes of pointless ""witty"" banter leading to nowhere, overly stereotypical cop behavior, all leading up to about 10 minutes of an actual cohesive, and somewhat interesting, story.Notwithstanding the 4 star rating here on Amazon, I think 2 stars is generous. I like a good cop show as much as the next guy, but this was a disappointment. I had to fast forward it a couple times, which is never a good sign for a movie, but at times it was that boring.If you want a good cop show, buy every season of The Shield and watch it from the start. You won't regret it. One of the best shows on television ever. Even better than the Sopranos."
2,What a Disappointment,Camera work was ok but besides that this was a storyline that went nowhere. Kept waiting for something to be pieced together and it never did.
1,Terrible Movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is a terrible movie. The language and violence is far more than was necessary. I am glad I didn't pay to go see this at the theater. Paying to rent it was bad enough.
2,Don't bother,"I saw the previews for this a few months ago and thought it looked interesting. Two policemen take on the drug cartels? Cool, right?To be honest, I wish I had my 90 minutes back. I didn't feel any chemistry between the two main characters, and everyone else's character development was pretty much non-existent. Sure, the two officers told lots of jokes, but I never really cared about them. What actual investigation did they do? Why did they deserve to be killed?How about the anatomy of the hit? How was it scheduled? Its plot wasn't developed at all--just phone call, gangbangers talk, then BANG. What about the anatomy of the cartel? How did it operate? Who were its leaders?The idea that a policeman would film his life was fine, but all the ""Look at me! I'm on camera!"" really took time away from actually telling a story from multiple angles. Just seemed like a whole bunch of crass dialogue between two guys, neither of whom had anything to say."
4,Damn!,"I have a nephew who is a cop. Also a daughter of a friend who police's in L.A. I can only hope they do not experience this action, over the top of violence , hatred, and modern day life.Good speed , the great protectors of the common people.The movie touches a cord , be careful , it's probably true what our boys and girls do everyday. Great movie!!!!"
3,ok,Pretty predictable. Part of the great charm of Jake is his hair....which is shaved off in this. Man crushing in super testosterone fashion
3,Not Sure What All the 5 Star Ratings Are About,"My wife and I watched this a couple weeks ago and we're still not sure where all the stellar ratings came from. The story was straightforward if not predictable and the action skewed into the unnecessarily graphic range. I've had time to reflect on a movie that needs no second thought and it's quickly blended into my memory of forgettable flicks. Watch it if you want, skip it if another movie looks slightly more promising."
3,Sory Line was ok,This movie remind me to much of Training Day and Colors ... But it was very entertaining ... You will stay on the edge of your seat ....
4,Strange ending,"The ending left me a little mystified, but overall this is a well done film! I wasn't sure exactly what to expect, but I enjoyed it"
3,Good Movie,Good actor's and a good cop and crime story. It's predictable but entertaining. It does hold your attention till the very end..
4,Wild Ride,This is not a feel good movie it represents more of what it is like to be a cop in L.A. It had me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie. It is like seeing a car crash you want to close your eyes but you just can't. Good acting and it felt real.
5,great film,"loved it, gripping, just like the real thing from a former LAPD.My iwfe and I both cried it was beautiful, I cant wait for a sequel!"
2,Just ok,"To much swearing in the beginning of the movie, rest of the movie was ok, looking for more Bruce Willis type movie"
2,NOT even close to Training Day !!,"Predictable, slow movie and extremely disappointing since TrainingDay was such the opposite.The ""bad guys"" were over the top. Particularly thefemale.The end was just stupid. Without being too detailed, there was arunning truck available. Why did the guy not use it ? That's only one of the many holes.Seems like they used lots of filler for little plot.The interaction between the two male leads was the only redeemingfeature of the movie, otherwise it's the same played out cops androbbers movie.Hope you enjoy it more than i did."
2,Not worth seeing,Two good actors put in a bad movie. this entire movie was shot with a video camera . Shaking the camera when a fight broke out just gave me a headache. The script was poor as well.This movie should have stated it was to be filmed by the actors video camera in which a documentary was being made. very boring to watch-music was horrible also.
1,No good,Didn't care for the movie at all. It became confusing at some point. Hard to follow. I will not recommend movie to others
4,Fantastic movie,"It was a great movie with lots of action, humor, and an unexpected twist. Shows great partnership and comradely in and off duty."
2,Trailer is best part,"After watching, my only thought was ""Can I get my $3.99 back?"" All the best parts of the movie are in the trailer."
4,"It's like Jarhead, but with cops","If you liked Jake's inner monologue from jarhead, you will love the first 5 min of this movie. It was gritty funny and entertaining. I am one of those guys that like to find the issues with continuation and if you watch the scenes in the car, why they go to Jake's view, watch the locking knob, once you see it go UP down Up down, you can't not see it. I felt the Sgt's back story need some development,as well as the officer who can't be promoted. It might also have been interesting to see some of the other car's nights. All and all it was a gritty/ fun ride full of racial poking and jokes that make close buddies would understand. I think it was a little shallow as far as acting depth and that is why I gave it 4 out of 5."
5,sad,at any point in my life i have always respected the police. for keeping us safe and on to keeping the us safe. this story/movie let the bad guys win. it killed me because so many times they do.good movie.but sad
3,so so,it was an ok movie a little slow at times. Still over all good. i might watch it agin to see if i missed any thing good.
1,Pointless film.,This movie seem to be made to shine light on the fact that gang violence is high in LA. DUH! The acting was bad and lacked substance. Very disappointed.
1,Total waste of time,Can you rate it less than one star? Couldn't stand it after 10 minutes. I would like credit on this one.
1,total dissapointment,"very slow going, bad filming like it was done on a camcorder. Story line weak and the ending was very anticlimatic."
1,Vulgar and obscene,"Vulgar, extremely poor language. An ugly story about ugly people. Of no value what so ever! I was inspired by this story to turn it off."
4,A good cop flick!,"I was impressed how they captured the grit and partnership of the job. I worked law enforcement for years, and every day is not the same."
4,"good movie, not great","Good movie, filming style made me car sick. Like the blair witch movie. 4 out of 5 given for this movie."
3,Pretty good,"The story was good and the acting was great. But the camera was too shaky about 85% of the time. At times it felt like a long episode of the show COPS. But other than that, I really liked it."
4,Enjoyed overall.,"Extreme use of the F bomb. Aside from that, seemed realistic. Good 'partner' story. The captain in the story is the person the idea for the movie came from. He's a real life officer."
4,Realistic,"Jake Gyllenhaal has developed into a strong actor. The film did not sugar coat the present situation existing in many of ourlarger urban areas. Being a female, I do not partake of the language used predominantly throughout the movie. Thought it wentslightly overboard. The ending was predictable. I did find it to be action packed and entertaining."
3,ehhhhh it was okay,"I think Jake Gyllenhall is a great actor. I wasn't surprised to see him portray this character well. That was about the extent of what I appreciated about this movie. This was not at all what I expected. I kept hoping the movie was going somewhere with the way the story was building up but I felt disappointed with the ending. it made these cops seem naive and reckless about what they were doing. This is just one opinion and everyone has different tastes. I'm a female and I like a good action/drama flick but I expected better. On the other hand, my brother enjoyed this movie. Lets say Im glad I didn't pay theater prices for this flick. I'd see it once to see Jake G. but not a second time."
4,Worth watching,The movie was good but I wasn't a huge fan of the ending. But everything up until then was really entertaining.
3,gripping,"Nothing novel in the plot but the director shows great poise in handling the screen play that manages to glue the viewer to the narrative.One would walk away wondering if there could have been more in terms of pure creative input towards the end of the movie. All in all , it is a decent watch."
5,Awesome!,This movie was so good! It was shot documentary style and the plot was great - very fast paced there were funny parts and also very sad :( parts! I would recommend this movie to anyone
4,Real story,"It is a healthy history and real without a happy end but very realistic finish!, for this reason I recmmend it."
5,Best cop movie...,End of Watch is the best cop movie I have ever seen. It is as close to real life as a movie can get.
5,End of watch,This is a great adult movie do not watch around children too much cursing and adult content but alot of action and a reality of the drug cartel in the country.
2,Very disappointed but you may not be,"I had to rent this elsewhere, because you can't rent on a Mac unless it is Instant Video.Not a real cop, but did spend two years working with narcotics and gang cops in a bad part of town, had been there for chases, had a drive-by shooting happen right in front of me, etc. So, ya, it is exciting and heart-pumping at times. These are excellent actors. However, the supporting characters, which are often the best in movies, are paper thin and one-dimensional. The non-action scenes seem mostly contrived to get you to the next action scene. If you are an action junkie, and really don't care if a story has a strong narrative, rich plot development and that kind of thing, you are going to be happy. If you are expecting another Training Day with interesting characters throughout the movie, don't expect much. In fact, expect very little."
3,Good Movie same Formula,"The story writing was strong in creating likeable characters out of two LAPD cops. This 'day in the life of story' has a lot of action and spends considerable time stressing thier friendship. However, the ending shows all of this to be a set-up to elicit an emotional response from the audience to an ending that would have been more interesting as the ending of the 2nd act and not the 3rd."
3,Attempts to deliever a gritty and emotional fee,"The cast is great, the look and feel was awesome, but the script left you wondering what they cut and what they should have left in. The film ended up being predictable in it's twists and turns.&#8203;"
2,Disappointed,Watched this with 3 college kids and my husband. Have to admit it wasn't on my favorites list to begin with but they were unimpressed as well. Slow and not much plot.
4,inner city life...,"An updated ""Colors"" about life beind the badge...Gyllenhaal and Pena flesh out their parts, and portray partners that deal with work in a stressful situation. I watched this movie 3 times in the alotted time, as as usual picked up new tidbits along the way. Worth the price of admission!..."
3,"very Good, but a bit over the top","Good action and story. Language is about as rough and gratuitous as any I've seen, though i don't watch a lot of Gangsta type films. Film like a documentary, supposedly by the cops, but I was never quite sure why. Must have been for some kind of realism thing. They did spare us of the ubiquitous sex scenes, thank you. They packed a lot in a short time. Overall it was well done and entertaining. definitely not for anyone under 18, in my old fashion feelings. Michael Pena was really good. Janet, Jake's love interest, seemed way too young for him. No real surprises or plot twists."
2,I hate this kind of FPS gimmicky Bair Witch Trial pics,"What was the director thinking when he decided filming this like a video game - home video horror flick? Extremely annoying and really distracting. Then, add the choppy nonsensical plot and you've got a true stinky."
5,Awesome,I am LEO and this rocked me to my core. Reminded me to be overly conscious of my officer safety. It should be seen by LEO's everywhere. Even shown in academies.
5,Good Movie,I thought this to be a good movie. Its shot more like a documentary (kind of like cops). It was very enjoyable.
4,Pretty good movie!,"End of Watch is a pretty good movie. The end is a bummer, but it is a cop movie- what to you expect? However, hubby did wish there was a little more action, or ""fighting,"" in the movie and expressed his disappointment quite a bit."
5,Amazing,The best law enforcement movie of all time. Actually depicts life on the streets as a police officer. Makes you feel like y
5,Great movie!!,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. it was very real and shows the dangers police officers face everyday.
3,grass beneath rocker,"If the lawn under the rocker is moist or soft or is under the rocker for very much wear, you may find more dirt than grass in that patch."
5,Works well,"I've been using a bucket seat to work in planting beds, but sometimes there isn't enough space. I bought this to solve that problem and it seems to do the job. I'm a hefty guy, so I needed something sturdy and this seems to be it, at least so far. It's a little pricey, but it was competitively priced here and I'm happy with it."
5,Wonderful back saver,This seat is wonderful for working in your yard & garden. It really takes a lot of strain off of my back. You can even use it for washing / cleaning your car tires. It's everything the ad claimed it to be. I just have to learn not to lean back to far.
1,No response from company,"We purchased one of these earlier in the year. It worked great untill the seat top collapsed and then finaly cracked.Ordered another one as a replacement and found the newer model was a different color. The recently purchased seat lasted only a few weeks and showed defects under the seat, now it is unstable.Item rated not to exceed 350 lbs and wife is far less then that. I think they have used another type of cheap plastic.Called company as required under warranty and still no response.Not worth the moneyJunk"
1,Not quite balanced,"I used mine today for the first time. Sat down and promptly fell backwards onto the lawn. Fortunately, it was mostly my pride that was hurt, but it might have been my head. I expected it to rock forward but not flip over backwards that way. Something about the center of gravity isn't quite right. I had mine pulled up to the highest setting, and perhaps that's why. Even at that setting, it's still low and not easy to get back up. I think I'll get a cheap plastic lawn chair, cut the legs short, and use that. With a pair of chair arms, you can push yourself up, and a chair won't flip backwards."
4,Helps a Gardener's Back,"I bought this garden seat after watching a segment on Gardening By the Yard with Paul James. I love it. It helps my back when I'm pulling weeds and planting. I even use it for other purposes, like keeping my seat dry when I'm playing in the sandbox with my son. It's adjustable and truly does rock when you move. My only complaint, and it's minor, is that sometimes, because it's so lightweight, it's a little unstable. But after some practice, you'll love it, too."
5,Love It!,This is my second garden rocker. My daughter purchased the first one for me about 6 years ago. I have a arthritis in my back and neck and I am an avid gardener. Using the garden rocker puts most of the pressure on my knees and legs and helps to alleviate the back pain. It is also easy to move around in the garden. I love it!
3,OK - but Baby One More Time was better,"This song is ok to listen to, but I much prefer Britney's dancy songs (hence review title) as they're more fun to listen to. This one wasn't as bad as Sometimes but it still wasn't great. Sorry, but I do think she should stick to love stories - she just comes over as painfully fake on this as she tries to make a moral issue."
5,Worth Every Cent!,"Britney's best song from Ooops!.. I Did It Again is ""Lucky"" and I consider myself lucky to own this great single, but in reality, it's not alone. It comes along with the excellent love song ""Heart"" and a remix of ""Lucky"" Don't wait on this one. It's very possible Britney's best song ever!"
5,Britney Spears is Very LUCKY!,"I like this song and I think she's cute. On the Nickelodeon ""All That Music Special"" did you see that boy rub on her? If u taped it you cann put it on slo motion and seee it good. If it's in slo motion you can tell that he wusn't suposed to do that because Britney looked back at him and smiled and you saw all of the other dancers laughing very hard."
1,We are all UNlucky,"How can she keep releasing songs that have no soul, no meaning? I'm really getting tired of Britney and her pre-fabricated teen pop fluff. Really, she has only a mediocre voice and this song does not sound good. I do not recommend this song to anyone. Stay away from it at all costs."
5,Debra Amidon - A 21st Century Peter Drucker,"In my twenties and thirties, while working in the Far East, I fell in love with Peter Drucker. Managing for Results became my handmaiden, and the centerpiece for many, many conferences where ""managing change"" was the prime topic.Now, in my early sixties, Debra Amadon's works have become my new handmaiden -- and the centerpiece for our own (rather novel) undertakings in the new learning space.John Hibbs[...]"
3,RUVLAMP1 not the same as UV100E1043,"There seems to be some confusion between item UV100E1043 (which Honeywell calls a ""SmartLamp"") and RUVLAMP1 (which is the ""dumb"" version of it). Both of them use the same UV bulb, but the SmartLamp version has additional circuitry that turns the bulb on when the a/c or furnace blower starts running, and turns it off 30 minutes after the blower stops - it also has an LED that flashes and/or changes color when the UV bulb is getting near the end of its useful life. The RUVLAMP1 version, on the other hand, simply plugs into a regular 115v outlet and is on 100% of the time. According to Honeywell product literature, the UV100E1043 SmartLamp technology ""extends bulb life by up to five times and reduces power consumption, lowering operating costs."" UV100E1043 is listed in the Honeywell product catalog; RUVLAMP1 is not listed at all - not sure what this indicates..."
3,Honeywell Air Treatment System,Arrived on time. Easy installation. Operates as described. Some Air improvement inside the house. I will need more time to determine how well this product performs related to family allergies.
4,Relentless,Walter is best served live and this is no exception. To bad the audio quality is bad even on the SACD. Is it just me or does his voice drop on the last two songs? Sounds like his mic quit? Walter is such a great player and I hope he releases a better copy of this. I will buy it again.
3,Good gitar playin.....but no Blues passion.,"I had never heard of Mr Trout before spying this DVD on Amazon. I purchased it and am sorry to say he does not provide an inspiring blues performance. He is a very good Guitarist with a very good band, but their stage presence is not very inspiring.Buy this if you like him, don't buy it if you are looking for a great blues experience."
1,The product information is not correct,"The information says:Volume Two 1952In this Volume from 1952 must be a short Movie with Barbara Stanwyck (Title: Gaslight). A parody for the real Movie Gaslight with Ingrid Bergman.But in the product here there is only one serial from the year 1952. The other three serials are from the yeas 1954-55.So the fact is: this is a very uncorrectly and bad information, because You mean, the serials are all from the year 1952 and Volume two of this year. But this is not true.Where is my Barbara Stanwyck?"
2,Not the best in the series...,"Of all the Delafield books, this was one of the weakest. Too many intersecting stories to really keep up. Had a hard time believing Aimee would be working so hard after the shooting. Worth reading for the sake of keeping up with the series."
3,OK But Not Great,This book was an OK book. Perhaps I was expecting more. One of the things that I did like about this book was Kates attitude and her love for being a member of the LAPD. I also the manner in which Ms. Forrest characterized Luke Taggert. I was disappointed by the lack of action in this book. Not being one who reads many mystery/dective novels I can't think of any other authors to compare this book with. Would I read another Katherine Forrest novel.? Yes. I never judge an author on just one book.
1,Incredibly Boring,"This book is definetely ""no frills"". The writing is terse, tense, clipped and unembellished to the point of tedium. Never again!"
4,Just rock!,"I picked this up after seeing them in Cincinnati in July of '01. The disc has been in heavy rotation since. Filled with eleven rock songs, the only time it lets up on the blistering pace is on the slide-accompanied ""This is Not The Time or the Place"" and the closing track ""What's Left Standing"". My current favorites are ""Supersad"", ""Smithsonian Liver"", ""Cool With Me"", and ""The Power of the Vitamins"".The album doesn't do justice to their live show. If they could capture that, much like At the Drive-In did on Relationship of Command, I'd have given it a five, no questions asked.Go see 'em live when they come to your town, and watch out for Casey on guitar, he's a madman."
4,yeah! this is the latin houst cd i was looking for!,one word describes this cd...SLAMMIN'!...GET IT!
3,Not what I was looking for.........,"I am a house junky, an lately I have been loving the latin house, the latin house that throws in nice bass line while using a traditional latin groove, the trumpet, piano, taking you to that little island south of Florida where my family called home... This disc does not have it at all, It is a decent mix of music, but it is very commercial, very basic, anything you can find on the radio, and here in NJ that is not saying a whole lot. I wish I can reccomend other dics but i have not found any realyl good latin house other than what my friends spin, and they don't have any discs out, well, not yet at least... If you want really good house music look into Dj Heather's ""tangerine"", anything from Eric Morillo, Dimitri from Paris, all the SF sessions and French sessions also."
5,"Super skilled original cuts, buy this cd set ... umm NOW!","This is my best music purchase ever. Yeah that sounds a bit much but look at what you get for the price! I don't know of any other box set that's as inexpensive as this. Thank you Ninja Tunes.It brakes down like this, the first cd has mostly hip hop, the second cd has a lot of jazzy hits, and the last cd called ""Missed, Flipped & Skipped"" is my favorite filled with unbelieviable beats for your head. I have not stopped listening to this cd set yet. It truly has something in it for everyone. Jazz appreciation and experimental electronic music are a big part of this album. If you get it I guarantee you won't be dissapointed (and guarantee is a strong word)."
4,"If you're going to get your feet wet, you may as well swim.","Lets rate the label not the tracks. The label, as it stands, is on the up and up, introducing the best aritsts that jazz-core and hip hop (REAL HIP HOP, NOT LUDACRIS) have to offer. The problem, is that this compilation only lets you get your feet wet in the ocean that this label has to offer. Tracks by Amon Tobin, Saul Williams, Kid Koala KILL the rest of the cd. I would honestly reccommend this compilation to those who are ready to dive into some deeper music, it's the perfect introduction into the world of electrojazz and tru hip hop heads. Heavy and hard, this one carries. Just know that this compilation is mearly a cliff note in the world of the tunes of the ninja. Ninja tune reprazent."
1,Not accurate,"Do not buy this book if you want to know anything about Columbine. You would think that someone with a Master's degree would know how to do some kind of research on a topic they are writing a book about. The facts presented in the book are not accurate. I felt my intelligence dropping a few points just reading it. It pains me to think that someone will read this ""book"" (for lack of a better word) and walk away thinking they know who the killers were or what really went down."
2,My least favorite recording.,"This certainly is a good example of how subjective music perception can be, or how random music reviews are. I bought this CD after reading all the incredibly positive reviews, and, after listening to it, couldn't be more disappointed and embarrassed. I find some songs here excruciatingly slow and drawn out. I don't enjoy the sound of Mrs. Davrath's voice (to me it often sounds thin and shrill), or the sound of the orchestra, and some of the woodwind instruments sound outright amateurish (nothing wrong with that at all, but frustrating on a supposedly professional CD).For anybody who wants to get to know these songs, which are among the most beautiful pieces of music I know, I would urge considering the unbelievably wonderful recording by Frederica von Stade, or at least the very professional and popular recording with Kiri Te Kanawa."
3,Good,This item was good. Smaller them expected though. For the money it should have been bigger. Shipped super quick and no problems at all
2,not so pretty,"This looks much prettier online than in person. When I received it it looked very ""buggy"" and more like a cicada than a butterfly. I couldn't imagine keeping it. On the plus side, the return was really easy."
5,500 Nations,"This is an amazing book, a history ignored by most Americans. The supply was excellent and the book quality as described."
2,"ok, but...","Reading this book, I felt like I was back in social studies class, fighting to stay awake. Much of the information is interesting but it's about as excitingly presented as an educational movie, or a taped guide to a museum exhibit. It has that same dumbed-down, patient, worthy feeling.The P.C.-ness of the book can induce its own kind of snooziness. Despite all the evidence he gives to the contrary, Josephy can't keep himself from portraying the Americas before the Europeans invaded as an Eden and the Europeans as devils. An Indian slaughters or conquers another Indian, and that's fine. A European slaughters or conquers an Indian, and that's evil. Zzzzzzz.Does anyone out there know of a steelier-eyed and less sugar-coated history of native America?"
3,"Works well and nice design, but could use improvements","As a squeegee it works well. The design lends itself to be used more like your car's window wipers than traditional bathroom squeegees. the double blades help make sure you never miss a spot you've passed over. and it looks clean and is well built (i've dropped mine several times from various heights and it has lived through it all).What I wish it had was some sort of storage functionality in mind. Some item descriptions say that is stands up for clean storage, but you'll find that this thing knocks over too easily. I guess putting a giant rope on the end of it would kind of kill the aesthetic, but some kind of clip/cradle could easily solve this issue. For me it just lays on it's side in all of it's non-glory"
5,SADDAM REBUILDS BABYLON,"Most Christians I know believe that Babylon was destroyed years ago and will never be rebuilt. And if it were being rebuilt you would think it would be front page news. But no.The rebuilding of Babylon has been going on for over 20 years. Dyer gives us 16 pages of pictures of rebuilt walls, Palace of Nebuchadnrzzar, Ishtar Gate, the Ninmach Temple, Sadam's guest house located in the center of Babylon, and a model of the Tower of Babel planned by the Iraqi government.My copy is the 1991 edition. I have not yet seen the new edition."
1,Foolish thoughts for foolish people,This book is utter crap. In fact the reviews by the other readers are more entertaining than the book itself. They are a frightening look into minds of those who choose to live in pure fantasy. This book would be outright laughable to anyone but a complete lunatic.
3,Unsettling,I didn't know he was this bad. I hope they catch him.But there was too much sex in the book.
1,I think both are right,"The 3/15/03 and 4/13/03 reviews have opposing opinions of this book. Funny thing is, both are right in what they say. Dyer's biblical overview is accurate but he has little to say about Saddam Hussein, despite the fact Hussein is on the cover of the book! I sure was expecting more info on Saddam Hussein than I got.Now that the 2003 Persian Gulf War is over, let's see if those ""weapons of mass destruction"" are found in Iraq, as President Bush insisted they would be. Any bets?"
4,Dictionary of Law,"As a paralegal student, I was fortunate enough to obtainCollins' Dictionary of Law which provided a thorough listing ofoft-used legal terms. I would encourage this purchase for anyone who either works in the legal profession or who would like to gain further understanding of the law. END"
5,Exactly what i wanted,I give it a five for delivering the unskipping quality we all love. I think the title says it all.
5,Naruto Box Set 10 Uncut,"Great DVD set, no problems what-so-ever. And it's the amazing clash of Naruto and Sasuke so what's not to love? lol Every Naruto fan needs this box set!!"
5,This DVD set just may have the greatest fight's in anime history!!,This is a seriously good dvd set. It include's all of the episode's from the Saskue Retreaval Arc of Naruto. Every fight in this arc are really good one's but the one that will really knock your socks off is the showdown between Naruto and Saskue. You heard me!! The two main character's in the show battle it out un interupted until one finally falls. A must buy for naruto and anime fan's alike!!
5,Ultimate battle,"A must have for all Naruto fans. The season ends with an epic battle that gives fans a glimpse of the awesome power within Naruto, as well as within Sasuke. You have to see it to believe it!"
5,Awesome! The return of Rock Lee and Naruto vs Sasuke,"Just awesome, the return of Rock Lee, the sand village joining forces with Konoha and the awaited combat between Naruto and Sasuke !"
5,Informative with lots of examples in c# and vb.net,"this book is just what I was looking for, when implementing some reporting functionality to our web app. The owc11 charting engine is powerful and flexible, and gives the developer a lot of control for customization. This book was very helpful, especially considering that there are not very many resources on the web on this topic.I recommend this book to anyone who is looking to develop their own charting and spreadsheet controls. The book is a nice starting point with a clear explanation and lots of code touching up on a lot of the owc functionality."
4,excellent resource for hybrid car purchasers,"This is an excellent, clearly written book that brings together lots of different details about hybrid cars, all in one place. I would also recommend ""Plug-In Hybrids: The Cars that will Recharge America"" for some more information on hybrids around the world, and the new feature of converting a hybrid into a plug-in hybrid."
4,Needs an update for 2009,"The book covers the basics and is a quick read with many pictures and diagrams.To be a full buyers guide it needs to cover safety ratings, stopping distance, and depreciation rates."
2,Book is mainly composed by (almost) blank pages!,Most pages only hold 3 to 5 lines of text (one short letter model per page).You get a very heavy book with a content that could have been printed on a much slimmer book!! Very strange way to publish...
2,Still brassy!,After reading other reviews here I had high hopes that this product would mean the end to brass in my dyed blonde hair. So I added two capsful to the L'Oreal extra light blonde tint/developer I buy at the drugstore. At first I was ecstatic at the cool ashy color I obtained after this process. But one week and two shampoos later the brass has started to reassert itself. What a disappointment! I've now ordered the Wella White Lady toner to see if its more purple color (as opposed to the blue in this one) will cancel out the yellow better and longer. Still I'd love to know why this Wella product essentially washed out. I did wait 48 hours before an initial shampoo.
2,not what i expected?,it says light drabber but they don't tell you it has a blue acsent? yes it turn your hair a tint of blue.
3,its fake!,"So, this stuff really does smell very good!However, when I opened my package, I did not recieve a bottle that said ""Versace"" I recieved a bottle that said ""VERSUS"" Does amazon purchase things from Chinatown???????? My purchase came straight from amazon, not from another retailer, so I would suggest buying this from somewhere else!!Again, it smells good, but it's fake!"
2,Cheaply made... doesn't hold up,if you aren't having a quick in and out.. the item where it needs to be thicker metal ..it isn't and will bend. It takes quite the scientist to maneuver properly. Make sure you know what your doing before trying this out on anyone.. as you can hurt them.
2,Pederson Vaginal Speculum -,"This speculum is so hard to use. You have to push the lever in while turning the screw around to make it tighter so it can expand. which is almost impossible to do alone.It keeps slipping back into its original position. Once it is in it will not expand like it is supposed to. when you sanitize it, do not put it into sterile bag until completely dry, because mine developed brown rust spots on the part that remains outside during use. It will Definantly take practice. I wish directions came with it."
1,junkWhen this item arrivved it was in pieces and the packin,"WHEN THIS ITEM ARRIVED IT WAS IN PIECES, THE PACKAGING WAS TORN AND CRUSHED IT IS USELESS.IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK THANKS FOR THE SCRAP METAL."
5,"Poetic, whimsical, brilliant !","This book about a ""terrible day at the circus"" is one of the wittiest, most intelligent children's books I've ever read. The rhythm of the lines is beautiful; the rhymes are natural; the story is intriguing. Our now 3-year-old has been enjoying it for about 9 months now, and still asks for it constantly... esp. after a trip to the circus!"
4,I LOVE TAMIA!!!,"I LOVE Tamia, and this is a great CD. It's got a strong beat and her fans will be pleased. The only thing is I wish you could hear her vocals a little bit more . .sometimes she is drowned out by the beat. However, I highly reccommend this for any Tamia fans"
4,Pretty Good,"I was actually looking for the remix and the original vesion of Can't Go For That, but I guess it's not on CD yet. Anyway, Can't Go For That is a beautiful song. It has nice beats and Tamia has a strong, but soft voice. This would get 5 stars, but Tell Me Who isn't that great of a song. If anyone sees the single for the remix, cop it. It's even better than the original."
4,Great Book,"A must have for anyone in a supervisory position. Really helps see the ""big picture"" and how to motivate your people."
2,Some aspects are enlightening....others are not,"I was looking for more information than this documentary provided. The segments on the Khe San and the city of Hue were worth watching, and it provides you a good insight into how the Marines did an oustanding job DEFEATING the NVA in the city of Hue/citadel, even though the Marines were greatly outnumbered. I didn't care about the personal accounts from the journalists and the segment called ""Command Decisions""----would have just preferred a narrative. Anyway, I was expecting a more comprehensive narrative about the war....but it may capture some aspects of the war that you won't see in other documentaries. It sounds like the National Geographic doc on Vietnam may have been a better choice for what I was looking for."
1,Woefully short of the mark !,"I bought this to get a start-to-finish understanding of the Vietnam War...why it occured, why the US involvement, how it ended. None of this is apparent and it dwells much to long on specific battles and worse, journalists ! The History Channel is usually first-rate but this isn't."
3,A Good Way !,Pleasant offering from this Latin-influenced rock band. A bit inconsistent but very good nonetheless.
4,"""On my Way"" is a hit in my book !","I saw De Sol on Backstage with Barry Nolan and I fell in love with ""ON MY WAY"" ! Contrary to some other reviews, I really enjoyed the entire CD and I find myself listening and waiting for my favorites to come on. I don't even advance the tracks so I can hear the whole thing. I didn't know of the group prior to this CD but I have a company that promotes artists and I really enjoyed this music.I do have an eclectic taste and you have to remember that this is subjective ! It will not appeal to everybody and that's what make the world go round right?If you like the Latin flavor, that of Reggae and Rock and think of them fused together- you will enjoy this CD.I highly recommend it.Ava Holly Lewis (""only1ava"" )"
4,useful color atlas,"The retained image is often critical to the diagnosis of infection. An astute clinician relies on visual to retrace the footprints of memories and association with a patient's condition, some gathered from past experience and others from a book or atlas. This volume by Conlon and Snydman provides vivid photographs of common and rare illnesses that all health providers should have outlined in their minds. This is a clear, comprehensive book, which is a valuable source of reference in the management of infectious disease."
1,"Little substance, fair reproductions",Another book on the overblown impressionists. Little commentary and fair reproductions. A perfect book to put on your coffee table with your Renoir coasters. Souveneir book only.
1,Sketchy details + 10 minutes coverage per outlaw + still black & white pictures = Better to read a book about the old West,"I bought disc 4 ""Outlaws: the Ten most wanted/The guns that tamed the West"" directly from the History Channel website 2 years ago.This DVD contains sketchy details. Also, it gives approximately 10 minutes coverage per outlaw. It has still black and white pictures and narration by somebody. There's no re-enactement. It's better to read a book about the old West. I gave the disc to my acquaintance. What a waste of money!"
2,The elementary west,"Sorry, but this series just doesn't have the depth to provide much more than a superficial look at the subject matter. If you are a wild west buff or a western history fan you won't pick up much here that you hadn't already seen or heard. I suppose it might be a case of trying to cram too much into spots that were made for t.v., but I just didn't see much here to recommend this series."
4,Mad's Music,"This CD contains 2 songs, Madonna's Music the album version, which is quite nice to have if you've bought the remixes. I was very anxious to listen to the 2nd second and as Madonna opened her mouth, I was AWED! I am not sure of the language yet, but she did it again, signing in what might be Sanskrit. The song has a sutle tune of various eastern-indian instruments, and madonna's voice and the words she utter are enchanting, there is a constant electronic beat throughout the song. Nice song. I don't think this song sounds anything like Shanti/Ashtangi, expect for bieng madonna's second Sanskrit song. So maybe Madonna never gave up on the religious look afterall, or maybe she's doing both now!"
3,Music,"I usually don't like Madonnas music much at all, it's just not my kinda music, but this is pretty good, it's my fave one she does!"
1,A bag of rubber bands are better protection,"Two cents worth of plastic, is not worth the disgust I felt as I opened the bag. This product is sitting in a pile of garbage next to my desk as I write this. Shame on the merchant. Don't buy into their snake oil, it might be nose grease."
3,watch out for the packing,"received broken product twice, very nice custommer service they re-send it but on the same package...anything else is a good product to protect your phone."
1,Quality control?,"Extremely poor quality, the faceplate started getting cracks on it 2 days after I got them, then it fell off, now the back plate is about to fall off. Not recommended at all."
5,Edie Sedgewick's superstar,I really enjoyed this book. I learned so much about her along with the others in the Factory. I also loved all the pictures they have inserted in the book. It was great!! I'm definitely adding this one to my book collection.
3,Interesting,This book is interesting. It is a little hard to follow because of the way it is written and some of the pictures are a little vulgar but I guess that sums up Edie. It is worth a read for anyone interested in this poor girl. There is something so so sad but so fabulous about her.
4,The Warhol scene in their own words,"If you don't know much about the Factory scene, this is a great way to introduce yourself.If you are not a fan of Andy Warhol, these anecdotes will probably confirm your view.If you are a fan of Andy Warhol, some of these anecdotes might change your mind.But, of course, he would excuse himself by claiming to be merely a spectator.This book is about Warhol and the Factory scene, but also much more. If you appreciate Joan Didion's view of the Sixties, you will find much to mull over here. If your vision of the Sixties is founded on peace and love, you may want to look elsewhere for inspiration."
4,ITS ALRIGHT,i like this cd. but not what i thought it would be. now he is much better on the ruff ryders volume 1 and 2 cds. but there are some good songs on the cd. so i hope the next drag on cd will be much better than this one. but keep it up DRAG> YOU CAN DO IT
5,Flame On,"This CD is pretty good. I've been keeping a close eye on Drag-On ever since I heard Down Bottem and Ruff Ryders Anthem remix. The track with Eve and Die 4 me is the best I think. But what I really wanted to hear more was Drag-On rapping fast. He could flow as fast as a forest fire spreading through dry grass, he should have did it more. I wanted to hear more Down Bottem style flows. If he has the ability to rap fast, he should use it more. Just a personal opinion. Buy the cd and show support, I want to hear more songs from this young fella."
3,I should have listened to the Source,"Drag-on made an album. he could've done better. He got mad cause the source rated it as average,but this shit is like border line weak! Drag-on is a nice rapper but this cd wasnt...Sorry for being frank.But he represent Tha Bronx, So I'll give him another chance,"
3,"In Stores Now ""Hell and Back"" the second album of Drag-On.","This Album isn't Drag-On's greatest and it's not a classicyou know good music from Drag-On like I do, go get Hell and Back.It's in stores now February 2004."
2,Dissapointing...Very,"Upon hearing Drag-on as a featured artist on certain other rough ryder albums, I thought he might have something going. Well, how wrong I was. This album basically is filled with poorly designed beats and terrible rhymes, it wont take many tracks to just ditch this album. Drag-on could really do better, he has the potential to be a real ROUGH-ryder, but he needs LOTS of improvment. It IS his first album, so he still may improve, but this album just isnt any good, poorly put together-seems rushed. If you considered him, you might want to RE-consider. Dissapointing:("
4,i missed this cd,cd in great shape. case all broken up. but it doesn't matter...this cd is GREAT! it has been YEARS since i listened to it and still remember majority of the lyrics.
1,PLEASE buy ANYTHING else!,"I bought the album mainly because of what I heard of Drags lyrical skills on the new PUN album, turns out his skills are nice but not spectacular, and production is wack, every song sounds like that swizz song on jigga vol3- DONT GET IT- drag leave ruff ryders, let me produce some beats and save your loot for that ghost dog soundtrack!"
2,THIS SUCKS DRAG-ON STINKS LIKE GARBAGE,"I bought this album for my birthday which was 3 months ago i cant believe i wasted money on this junk the source was RIGHT i Should have listened to them they Gave Drag-On a 2.5 which i think he deserved because this cd is GARBAGE! Only 3 songs are good which are Niggas die 4 me,Spit these bars And Get it right. There are 19 songs on this album and only 3 are good this is garbage im going to put this Cd in the garbage because that's where it belongs. If you want any ruff ryders solo album, get LOX,EVE or DMX Next time i will listen to the CD instead of rushing out and buying it."
1,1 star for being a Ruff Ryder,I was a drag-on fan until I heard this album. A lot of people here at my college agree with me. When it came out a lot of people had it because he had two sweet video's but thats the only 2 song's on the album. I tried to feel this album but this album was some junk. I dont know about Ruff ryders Volume 2 because Swiss is doing that too. He also did the lox album and it was SOSO.
2,drag was dragging his feet...,"i like the ruff ryders, i think that they are one of the hottest hip-hop labels out right now, and that's why i was so dissapointed when i listened to this cd. every track sounds the same..and in every track drag tells us how he's the ""opposite of H2O"". the cd litterally sounds like a broken record. drag has brought some heat on his fellow ruff ryders' albums (EVE, DMX I & III, the LOX) but when it came to his own album it sounded as though he just kind of threw it together. it's like he rushed through all of his rhymes and that's why they all sound the same, song after song after song. there are 19 tracks on the cd and i would say 4 of them are worthy of praise...that's like 20%, not real good odds and definentley not worth my 15 bucks!"
5,WHERED HE GO! SOPHOMORE WE NEED IT!,"Best Songs: Opposite Of H20, Spit These Bars, Life Goes On, ... Die 4 Me, Groundhog's Day, Here We Go, and Ready For WarWorst Songs: Pop It and The Way Life IsBeats: 7/10 Lyrics 6/10Great debut sequel drops Summer 2002."
5,Won't be let down,I never heard of Drag On before until my cousin let me hold the cd. I ws very impressed with this album. I know Eve and DMX other rappers on the same label but I have to say this surely takes the cake. I will stay updated on his next album that comes out and be sure to check out is earlier albums.
1,Waste,This album is a complete waste of time. Not one track stood out. Rapping with the Ruff Ryders may be fine for Drag but solo is a different story.
3,Dissapointing,"I had been waiting for this album for a long time, Almost a Year.And it dissapoints me still after I have listened to it over and over again.I expected a landmark album from Drag-On, who i just loved on DMX's ""No Love 4 Me"" or Ruff Ryders ""Down Bottom"" he just shined on those tracks. But there are few songs on here, that are even listenable. I love 3 songs ""Ni**as Die 4 Me"", ""Spit These Bars"" and ""Opposite Of H2O"". Those 3 songs i can listen to over and over again. Other then that, some of these songs prove to be quite corny. The choruses are just annoying most of the time. It's an overall OK album though. The skit where the handicapped guy gets thrown down the hill is just bad. ""Ready For War is an ok song though too with the Lox. But the rest of it is either ok or weak. I wish he woulda spent some QUALITY time on here, and not just Empty Time where he recorded subpar music."
1,IT Missed by a Long shot,"This record was a disappointment. The only reason it got one star from me is because of the beats. The lyrics are worthless. Drag plays out the title of his album in every song almost. From a real music fan to another there are only about 3 to 4 good songs on the album. It is easy enough to say Drag-on is no where close to DMX, Jay-Z, or even Beanie Seagal."
1,The Opposite of Hot,"The WORST of the Ruff Ryder camp, this album affirms how sorry Drag-on earned that title. This junk is horrible. SOMEBODY PLEASE TAKE THE MIC AWAY FROM THIS FOOL!"
4,Itzak's music is always enjoyable.,Delivery excellent. Recording very nice for a first in my collectionof his stuff. Would like to see what others are like though.
5,childrens bible,This book is a wounderful depicktion of the time from Genesess right up to the resurect ion of Christ.All thou by today media out dated format.
5,Children's Bible,I gave it at Christmas and the child loves it and so did his family. I gave several of the same which I also gave years ago to my nephews.
3,Illustrations gave me nightmares,"The illustrations scared me when I was little. I stopped looking at it after a while, since all I could see was the devil in the shapes and shadows in my room."
5,Great Grease,I wanted marine grease because of its durability. Would buy again this is decent grease at a reasonable price point.
4,Education of A Maiden,This is the same story as The Romance of Lust with a different title some parts missing but a complete ripoff.If you hav bought one dont buy the other.
3,more of the same,"The only problem that I have with these books is that so many of them are partially compiled from one another. If you have very few of these books, this is a great source of inspiration with many varied color images. If you have a more vast library I think that this book does not offer anything drastically new."
2,Everything but the kitchen sink,"I've read all books in the series (which I'm normally fond of), but this one was just a little too overloaded with characters, plots, and angst. I didn't really care about the too out-there Shangri-la villianess or her cat, and I was annoyed with the heroine Temple (who actually seemed to be more in the background). I think Ms. Douglas does a much better job juggling a complicated storyline in the next book, Cat in an Indigo Mood."
1,Life is too short to waste it on a book like this.,I simply did not understand the story. I had to force myself to continue to read and when I was finally finished - I could hardly believe it. I felt cheated and betrayed. I could hardly understand what had happened and could not figure out the ending. Was the mystery solved? Who was the killer? I could only guess. So I visited this site to read other people's review and was stunned to find to find that the average rate was 5 stars! They must be loyal to the author or be crazy about anything that has to do with cats. Or I must be from Mars. I love books and I love mysteries - but this is the worst mystery I have ever read. Perhaps the author should consider another genre of writing. I feel bad giving a bad review but want to warn others not to read this book.
4,You can not keep a straight face! I dare you!,"This final set is without fail the best of the whole series. Even better than the Christmas Special. The characters truly shine. We had already seen these but decided we had to own it. My sweetheart breaks into bursts of laughter no matter how many times she watches, and you do really care about the quirky characters from the fictitious village of Dibley."
5,Loved it!,I purchased this DVD because I adore Richard Armitage. I had no expectation of really liking the series and I had no prior experience with the other parts of the series ... but I was so surprised to find the whole thing soooo funny! I did end up loving it and I've watched it twice already. The characters are so likeable and the lines are very funny. Highly entertaining! You don't need to be a follower of the series to like this one.
5,what a wedding,YES! At last the vicar snagged her a good man who is very good looking as well. And WHAT A WEDDING! The Dibley crowd go all out for their vicar. Bizarre as usual but from their hearts. Very enjoyable.
5,Great Ending to a Great Series,"We owned the previous shows and were excited to get these last shows. They did not dissapoint. It was great to see some of the previous characters, if not all, and see how they had aged. Great ending to a Great series."
5,One of the best shows ever,"I happened to catch part of the first half of this final show on PBS one night, not even knowing what I was watching. I searched on line to find out what show I had been watching that night because it was so hilarious. I finally found it under BBC shows and found out that it was being released on this DVD. What a great show. Funny, charming, heart warming and easily one of the best TV shows I have ever seen. I just finished ordering the Immaculate Collection, which includes this final show, as well as all of the shows and specials from the 12 years this series was on TV. I can't wait to see the other shows in the series. I don't think anyone will be disappointed if they buy this DVD, but I would spend the money and get the Immaculate Collection so you can have all of the Vicar of Dibley shows. What an amazing and talented ensemble was put together for this show, along with some great writing. A must have!"
4,Vicar of Dibley Specials,Wonderful series. The specials are a bit uneven. But like this series they always bring a smile. Season 1 is great.
5,Funny and the story told in a new light,"Thought the Christmas story was told in a new light, different but not offensive and quite entertaining and still had a good message"
3,Not as good as the originals,"We love the Vicar and the loony town of Dibley. There will always be a soft spot in our heart for them, but, as with many season finales, this one lacks some of the charm and wit of the original series. Nevertheless, we still think it is an improvement over the tenth anniversary special. Though we are sad to see the characters go, it is probably time to for the town of Dibley to move on and for the story to come to an end. In that way, these final episodes provide some nice closure for fans. Still glad we own it and makes for a nice rounding out of the story."
5,Fabulous,The Vicar of Dibley - A Holy Wholly Happy EndingAbsolutely fabulous in every way if you're a Dawn French as the Vicar of Dibley fan. Loved every minute of it!
5,Wonderful Series,"If you are a fan of The Vicar of Dibley, or just a fan of the BBC, this review will not come as a surprise. British TV at its finest. The VoD's series finale is among the very best of the cast. You can't find much more comedic talent in one group than this. enjoy."
5,"Great ""part-one"", disappointing ""part-two"" -- still a must see...","I gave this 5 stars -- the first episode here greatly deserves it, but the last and final episode was, as someone else here noted -- a bit flat, writing-wise. It's always diffcult to keep the last episode of a comedic series light-hearted when all of the players, writers, and crew are feeling sad and nostalgic, I suppose, but here the writing is just not up to the importance of the moment. Still the romance with the truly appealing (and pleasingly believable) Richard Armitage left things in a good place for our dear Vicar, and in the end this is an absolute must see for those who have followed the series."
4,No-No-No-No-No-No-Yes......No,"I have mixed feelings after watching this much-anticipated ending to the Vicar. Part I was as good or better than ANY other episode of the show (and I have the complete collection). My sides were splitting the entire time, definitely 5+ stars.However, the final episode was a bit of a letdown, it was almost anticlimactic. I think the writers and directors had peaked on the previous episode and just didn't have anything left to give. It rather dragged, the humor, while bawdy, just wasn't very funny; I mean, you can take Owen's (literal) love of animals only so far before it just gets old. Even Alice wasn't very funny in the final show, her fixation with hanging a fake beard on Geraldine for the wedding left me flat. 3 stars (barely).I'm really sad the show has run its course. To me, it is probably the best show ever to come from the BBC and I will miss it. I just wish it could have ended with a little more zing."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A ridiculous movie that has almost nothing in common with Silence of the Lambs (though it might share a kinship to the freakshow that was Hannibal), Hannibal Rising is neither interesting nor plausible nor well-made: apparently only Anthony Hopkins was holding this franchise together."
4,"Not as good previous, but still worth while","Sure, this does not have Anthony Hopkins, but how could it? This is the backstory to the great series of books/films in the Hannibal Lector series. Based in Lithuania and France during the WWII and the aftermath of the Nurenberg Trials, Hannibal Rising takes us through a backstory of how a montser is born. Guspard Illiel does a decent job as a young Lector, but the performance was a bit stale, but it is tought to follow Sir Hopkins. The overall cast was decent, story plausable and reasonable fit with the story of the series. I'm sure this will not be the last in this series. There will likely be a filler inbetween this one and Manhunter/Red Dragon soon to come in the next 2 years. Worth going to see if you are a fan, and if you are new, see Manhunter (better of the two) or Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs, and Hannibal first."
1,NEVER RECEIVED,ORDERED & PAID IN JULY 2009NEVER RECEIVED DVDNEVER RECEIVED RESPONSE TO EMAIL INQUIRYNEVER RECEIBED CREDIT FOR CHARGESCAN I GET THIS DVD?????????????????????
4,Really like this prequel!,"Gaspard is a good actor becoming a great actor! Amazing performance that has me believing he is young Hannibal and keeps me mesmerized till the very last bite! Sadly, I brought the DVD to my friend's house & when I mailed back a box if CDs & DVDs, the USPS delivery person stole the box that I didn't insure because they lied and said Delivery Confirmation was insurance! Someday I will buy another copy for my collection as this is worth having."
5,intense yet satisfying,"Liked the story of what made Hannibal Hannibal - how he got to be the way he turned out. Tragic story - intense, emotional and gruesome. High production quality - the great filming, sets and eerie music made it quite compelling. I love thrillers and this one was a hit with me. Don't know why it didn't get good reviews from the critics. I hope to see another one to find out what happened next."
4,Get ready for gore!,I read the book and I think the movie did a good job of telling Hanibal Lector's childhood story. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I thought the gore was a little over the top.
4,I just flat out like Hannibal,I love the series. This is a great film. Some of it can be a bet... meh... but all in all I enjoyed it.
3,Was Ok,"Since this one bombed so badly at the box office I didn't have much hope for it. After watching it though, it is not that bad. It is certainly no Silence of the Lambs or Red Dragon, but it was interesting. The movie is very dark. Most of the characters have very dark sides. Though I do have to say that everyone has a reason for their actions which makes it more realistic. Hopkins is sorely missed, but even the best makeup can't make him 40 years younger to play himself in his early 20's. The young actor playing young Hannibal is solid and certainly creepy, he also came across a bit flat. The story is interesting on how Hannibal became the monster he is. I think the aunt part is not really necessary and muddles things somewhat. Overall I think this is worth watching if you are a fan of Hannibal, but on its' own it is merely so so."
4,Well made edition to the Hannibal series,"I just finished watching this movie and I must say that I thought that it was very good and very well made. I heard(or read) some negatives about it, but I thought the film was well written, interesting and filled in ""the gaps"" of why Hannibal became ""Hannibal the Cannibal"". I thought that they could have made it corny or on par with a ""jason""or ""Freddy"" movie franchise but I actually understood the character better. Plus, I thought the actor portraying Hannibal did a magnificent job of portraying a young, intense, angry and vengeful Hannibal. Don't listen to the negatives without giving this movie a chance for yourself. It was a very good suspense drama."
3,An Overall Solid Movie (Rating: 7 out of 10- -3.5 stars),"This movie I enjoyed for the most part. I thought the movie was easy to follow, as well as all parts played real well. The story is basically about a boy who's family was killed during the World War II time and it has affected him in a very negative way, in which he goes and get his revenge on those who killed them. I believe what was dissapointing was that this was not as good as the origonal, but still a great follow up. If I had to pick a favorite part about this movie, it would be the final scene, as well as the one where. There are a lot of killing and decafitating of people's heads, as well as violence, but I still loved this movie. There are some parts that drag, mostly in the middle of the movie, but I still believe it is worth checking out.I really didn't read the book (I didn't even know there was one until today) so I really cannot compare. Either way I found this to be a very solid movie, but not like the origonal. Peace!"
2,Flop from the top,"Terrible disappointment from previous Hannibal films. The plot and acting dosen't measure up to Anthony Hopkins performances, This flick not worth buying or watching"
3,Please Unlock The Case,"The DVD received was in a specially locked case requiring two rather large magnets to open; the sort found in one's PC hard-drive. As I didn't have a spare hard-drive or huge magnets laying around, it was quite impossible to open the case without damaging it. I suppose such security measures prevented the postman from viewing my movie before delivering it, but it also prevented me from easily viewing it myself. Absent huge magnets of opposing polarity, a full-moon, and skillfully rendered placement of aforementioned magnets, I used pliers to destroy the locking mechanism. The DVD, which was received already being off of the holding center-post and sliding around inside, survived my violent assault on the locking mechanism. The movie was great. Recommend future DVDs be examined for the installed Homeland Security, Anti-Terrorist, Magnet Locking Device, prior to shipment to customers. Oh, and yes, please unlock them."
3,READ THE BOOK FIRST,"I pity the person who watches this movie if they haven't read the book first. The movie is reasonably loyal to the plot-line in the book, but if you don't have the background you will find it boring and dis-jointed. The beginning is very slow, and again difficult to follow unless you already know where it's going. A much better book than movie. It's also a little hard to believe that the lead character will grow up to look like Anthony Hopkins (the one and only Hannibal). The casting stretches the credibility if you view this movie as part of the franchise (and why else would you want to buy it or see it?). If you have read the book you'll probably enjoy it (I did) if you haven't, you'll probably fall asleep in the first hour (my roommate did)."
5,Pleasant Surprise,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that this film was able to meet the high standard of quality that Silence of the Lambs, Red Dragon, and Hannibal all achieved previously. Although we do not find Anthony Hopkins anywhere in this romp through Europe, Gaspard Ulliel manages to characterize Thomas Harris' Lecter perfectly. This little-known, handsome young Frenchman has just the right accent and mannerisms that capture the enigmatic Lecter which Hopkins created in the series. Overall this is a great movie, well shot, and nice performances by Gong Li and Dominic West as well. Hopefully we can steal Ulliel from France and see him in more English language films in the future."
2,Hannibal Rising,The movie seemed sloppy and haphazardly made and didn't do justice to the Hannibal character developed in the previous movies.
1,Are You Kidding Me?,"This has got to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. The plot makes absolutely no sense and the acting is brutally awful. I saw this in the theater and within 30 minutes I wanted to leave. I almost fell asleep. The entire Hannibal collection is pretty bad in my opinion, even Silence of the Lambs, (which I found really boring), but this film hits an all-time low. Avoid at all costs."
1,Schlock,"Hannibal Lector is one of the most fascinating and enigmatic villians in modern cinema. Well, at least he was ... until this schlocky, cheesy and embarrassing film came along.""Hannibal Rising"" creates a proposterous backstory of Hannibal Lector as a traumatized child whose sister is cannibalized by soldiers, and then ends up the adopted son/lover of his uncle's Japanese wife. Gaspard Ulliel, with a phony dead look in his eye and his hair hanging in his face, looks like he could have been plucked from any high school drama club. Whoever thought he was ready to fill the shoes of Sir Anthony Hopkins was clearly off their meds.""Hannibal Rising"" is easily the worst film I've seen since ""Basic Instinct 2""."
1,Sad Waste,"This movie is laughable and is almost reminiscent of one of those 90s butcher flicks where there's a weak story as a excuse for a slaughter. Where do I begin? For starters, they completely missed the boat on the complex nature of Hannibal Lecter for he is no weak, blood driven psychopath. There's nothing in this movie that remotely hints at the sophisticated genius and savage animal that both grow within Hannibal at equal measure. The sexual tension between Hannibal and his 'aunt' is also a joke for to date none of his movies have ever indicated him toward a romantic interest in anything. His relationship with Starling herself was one that bordered on something between paternal and collegial as though she were a rare find of a colleague. So this movie is clearly a work of fantasy and I imagine if the author of the series were to watch it, he would either be inspired to laugh himself silly or cry at the misrepresentation of his greatest creation."
1,Hannibal Rising,"In 1944, Hannibal Lecter (Ulliel) sees his parents die in a battle outside the family cabin. He and his sister are captured by some locals, and in the bleak winter eat Hannibal's sister to survive. Eight years later, Hannibal seeks out his uncle's widow, Lady Murasaki (Li), and moves in with her. Hannibal's goal is to locate the guys who ate his sister and kill them. Hot on his trail is a French police inspector (West), who knows what Hannibal is up to but cannot prove anything.""Hannibal Rising"" may as well be titled ""Hannibal: Death of a Franchise"". It is completely unnecessary and makes a joke of everything that has gone before. Ulliel is greatly miscast and does not even come close to filling the shoes of Anthony Hopkins (who wisely has steered away from this film). This has to be one of the bigger disappointments in recent years. Stick with ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Red Dragon"", and forget about ""Hannibal Rising""."
2,Where's the Joker?,"This was, for all intents and purposes, the same movie as ""Batman Begins"" ... except that Batman was fighting crime and not a psychotic cannible. It gave you some idea of how a person like Lector could have developed and sometimes even made you like him all the more. Much like the TV show ""Dexter,"" it portrays the killer as hero. I liked the film, though it was immediately forgetable. It further suffers from being the 4th (or 5th depending on how pedandic you are) in the Lector series of films."
2,Hannibal Rising ? or Falling!,"It was nice to know where it all started but the movie was sketchy at best.I would not recommend the purchase but just a rental. After I spent the money courtesy of my husband's request, I realized that the money could have been spent more wisely elsewhere."
3,Strange Flashback,"Not much insofar as Horror Movies go, but this did provide me with a Flashback to when I was a kid living in Paris. I took a beautiful Gypsy girl (or, rather SHE took ME) out to a little bistro. They had a cage with all these little birds, songbirds, inside at the back of the restaurant near the Kitchen. She told me that they were Orlotang Buntings, a French delicacy. They'd be captured in nets, then force-fed seeds and fruit laced with brandy or something. It was customary to eat these things in a broth with one's head covered by a shawl, the better to enjoy the odour. I remember she said it was some sort of religious ritual.Until seeing this movie, I've never since thought about those poor, obese songbirds in a cage in a restaurant on the Left Bank."
2,Skip the Blu-ray edition,"This is one of the worse Blu-rays I have ever seen. The quality of the picture is fine,but there are no extras at all; not even subtitles. There is no, I repeat, no disc menu and the pop-up menu consists of only audio choices of 5.1 or DTS 5.1 or French 5.1. I would not buy this edition or recommend it. Instead get the wide-screen edition DVD. It'll play fine on your Blu-ray with an excellent picture and this film is certainly worth watching for all Hannibal Lecter fans and all fans of Thomas Harris. It was not a big hit when it first hit the theaters and I don't know why. It is very good. An excellent screenplay (the first by Thomas Harris) and very good direction by Peter Weber. I guess folks were tired of the series. It is an underrated thriller. I can't believe the Blu-ray edition had any input by Harris or Weber. It is a waste of the Blu-ray format. Get the regular wide screen edition, you will not be disappointed."
1,THE WORST!,"I am an AVID FAN of Hannbal Lecter/ Anthony Hopkins and I have to say this was an absolutely stupid, unreal, fast forward to get it over with, movie! The ONLY thing that would make you even THINK this was about Hannibals boyhood is the photo on the front cover of the DVD! The character they have playing Hannibal Lecter is a terrible missmatch and in no way would you believe he later became the man we see in the other movies -Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon. If it didn't have the name Hannibal Rising on the cover you would NOT BOTHER TO SEE IT! Don't waste your money on this one. I'm sorry I did!"
2,Disappointing,"Started out interesting, then became repetitive. I think the film makers wanted us to sympathize with Hannibal because of the trauma he experienced as a child, but that wasn't enough to make us care about him as a psychopathic murderous adult. Because we don't care about him--or his victims--there is no emotional investment, no real stakes. I don't mind violence (and this movie is violent), but having characters that I don't care about is unforgivable. It's too bad because I was excited to see Hannibal's origins. Now, I don't care."
3,Hannibal Rising...,"Still not 110% sure.The back story was wonderful, marking time and place in Hannibal's childhood and youth. This movie was very similar to Batman Begins in bringing the 'truth' behind the man to life.The story strayed at times from the book(s) to which I confess I never finished. The movie certainly had it's gore elements.Not my favorite movie of the Hannibal series; but definitely worth piecing the puzzle together (especially if you have not read any of the books)."
1,"Boring ""Batman Begins"" Rip-Off","This movie wants to be ""Batman Begins"" and have it's teenage audience so bad it can taste it! Unfortunately it flopped and for good reason. It's an unecessary over explanation of a character that was far more terrifying having some mystery about him. It's a collection of homages to the other films in the series, which makes it feel like an uninspired cash in aimed at the teenagers who wouldn't watch ""Silence Of The Lambs"" because it's an ""old"" movie with that ""old"" guy in it. Takes away from the series more than it adds. The film is slow and boring, you keep wondering when it's gonna end. It seemed like a 3 hour movie with nothing of much interest happening. Wished I'd saved my money."
2,"dull, dull, dull",A completely unnecessary and incredibly dull adaptation of the book describing Hannibal the Cannibal's unfortunate childhood and motives for becoming a....consumer. Why did they even bother making it? Why did I rent it? Maybe it was my freebie that day.
1,The most important questions are never answered,"""Hannibal Rising"" doesn't answer the most important questions. Such as: how does the liver of a war criminal taste with chianti? How many Hilfswillige can you consume at one single occasion? Why weren't there any starlings among the ortolans? And where were the French police when Vichy put little children on trains to Auschwitz?And do Japanese women really have....?Frankly, this movie really sucks. ""The silence of the lambs"" was a *very* good movie. ""Hannibal"" was not. Care for some delicious brain, inspector Starling? And now this...Incidentally, I also wonder how a bourgeois defector from Soviet Lithuania could return to the USSR in the middle of the Cold War, using his real name? Perhaps Hannibal the Cannibal had connections with Beria?One star.Time for a snack..."
2,Writing?,"""Pray"", not ""prey""...perhaps it was a feeble attempt at a pun - if so, learn the use of quotation marks. And did you mean ""worth"", or ""wrath""? Because since you didn't take the time to install Google spellcheck, we don't know.""Grisly"", not ""grizzly""...one describes the gore you meant, the other is a kind of bear.If you're a professional, then write like it; otherwise, stick to writing consumer reviews. The language is taking enough of a beating without the pro's kicking it while it is down."
4,Good chill movie,I like Joaquin. Movie wasn't like the most magical movie ever but worth watching. Maybe it should have been called 1.5 lovers ha.
3,Slow but great cast,This movie was a very slow moving movie but the cast made it watchable til the end. I thought it was a bit unrealistic but all in all I enjoyed it:)
2,Blah!!!!,Nothing special about this one!!! This was just a dull movie. Phoenix did a good job of playing a depressed grown man living with his parents. Paltrow's role just wasn't believable (maybe it was all the extensions!). The movie lacked substance. It was just ok. Barely worth a rental fee.
4,Excellent film,My wife and I sank into this story and enjoyed the realistic situation and setting. Excellent acting on the part of Phoenix.
3,"JAMES GRAY, OPUS 4","Bipolar Leonard Kraditor wavers between aerial and frail Michelle who's always attracted by heights (talking on the roof, going upstairs never downstairs, etc..) and the more basic and maternal Sandra. This romantic literary theme, the opposition between Ideal and Reality, is perfectly handled here by James Gray. Now, one could consider that this intellectual exercise is a little vain. Nonetheless, I recommend this film."
3,"Good Movie, but not an original story line","The movie itself is good, but the story has been done before from a hit film in the 1980's. If the story was original or at least from an obscure forgotten novel or episode than I would have given it five stars.[pjt]"
5,"Great cast, interesting music",I was pleasantly surprised when Mancini's 'Lujon' was used during the NYC/restaurant scenes. Can't get enough of Joaquin. I hope he doesn't stop acting.
4,Love?,"Two Lovers is a beautiful and complicated film about what the heart wants, and what the heart really needs. Joaquin Phoenix, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Vinessa Shaw all give powerful performances. Phoenix is the best actor of his generation, hope he comes to his senses and returns to acting in the future. I loved the writing and film score as well. Two Lovers shall leave wanting more. Enjoy!"
1,Boring movie,"It will be sad if this is Phoenix's last movie as he is a really good actor. But this movie is not about anything exciting, just a guy stuck in the family business who picks the more exciting girl but when she doesn't pick him, he settles for the other girl. The cast is great with Isabella (needed more screen time) and Gwen but beyond that it is a waste of time unfortunately, not worth seeing in the theater or as a rental."
1,An insult to moviegoer's intelligence,"I watched this movie just for Phoenix. No wonder he left this business, and refused to publicize this movie on the Letterman's show.Phoenix, a depressed suicidal only child of a Jewish couple, is set up with the daughter of business associate, but falls in love with the neighbor (Paltrow). Paltrow, a drug addict, is the mistress of a rich attorney who is unlikely to leave his wife for her. The movie is poorly made and full of cliches. One does not care what happens to any of the characters. An insult to the intelligence of any moviegoer, this movie reminded me of ""Seven brides for seven brothers"" of 50 years ago, but without the beautiful music."
1,"Slow, predictable, AWFUL","I am stunned I even sat through this entire movie. From the first minute to the last, I was wishing it would end or, at least, that something would happen. Anything. It was just awful, just supremely awful. Joaquin Phoenix is PAINFULLY BAD. Paltrow is no better. Wow, I cannot believe I just watched this utter nonsense. Terrible. Just terrible. My advice, keep looking . . . there is most definitely a different way to spend your time."
2,"Should be called ""Two Losers""","The acting was fine but the whole time I'm watching this movie with disgust. As a woman, I've been where both these women are in their life and let me just say that it's not a time I choose to relive."
5,THIS IS AN AMAZING FILM!!!!,"Writer/Director James Gray crafts a subtle, yet gripping story that possesses an emotional resonance rarely explored in modern American Cinema. This is truly a tour-de-force film, with Oscar-worthy performances from Phoenix, Paltrow, Shaw, and Rossellini. Rent it and enjoy!"
2,Simple Knits for Little Cherubs,"While Erika Knight's books are delightful, they are riddled with errors. The same is true here. Another reviewer of one of her other books noted the same problems. She and her staff have not in any way made sure that these patterns are error-free. I have emailed her with no luck. Her website has a list of other books with errata, but there is simply no excuse for this sort of sloppiness.Proceed with caution, but the patterns are gorgeous!"
4,Well detailed classic knits,"This is a wonderful pattern book - not fancy, tricky, or trendy - just clean classic fashions with lovely shaping details. A good book to add to your collection whena gift for a little one is needed."
1,Shadow Watch,"This book was the absolute worst book I have ever read. The characters were horrible, the dream sequences were horrible, but Tom Clancy is a great writer except when he is writing this series. There is absolutely no way I will ever read another Power Plays book."
1,Not worth the paper it is printed on.,"Terrible. Having read (and thoroughly enjoyed) the likes of Patriot Games and Hunt for Red October I feel bitterly disappointed by this spectaculary unsuccessful collaboration. It seems to me that dedicated Clancy readers are being exploited and cheated by being duped into buying this utter rubbish that is clearly not his work. It is the work of an ameteur. If this book did not have Clancy's name on the front of it than it would surely not have been published. I had to force myself to finish it. I really couldn't care less what happened to anyone in the story as the characters were so badly drawn and deadly boring. I am very glad that I kept the receipt. Line your hamster cage with it, use it to start your fire, even make little aeroplanes out of it, but PLEASE DON'T READ IT!"
3,"second weakest of the op center, net force & ruthless series","This books is not as bad as the Net Force - Hidden Agenda paperback. Some of the characters and the technology are interesting. The plot moves along nicely. Nevertheless, it is a far cut below the better of the Op Center books. Being disappointed with the two most recent books starts to raise some interesting questions about whether I will buy the next chapter of each of these franhises when they come out... As someone who has read Clancy books relgiously since the beginning, i am beginning to question where this is going."
2,A good beginning.....and from there it went downhill,"After reading Shadow Watch i was dissapointed. Most Clancy books are great but this one however was just, well....not good. The beginning was ok with a space shuttle that blows up at its launch date and leaves everybody in the book (including you the reader) in shock. the book from there manages to keep up with an all out assault on a factory in SA. But from there the book dies. None of the characters were described well in this book and it was hard to finish the next 200 some pages. The only real reason this book was published was because Tom Clancy had his name on it. To make it short, spare yourself of this book and get a good Tom Clancy book such as Patriot Games or Red Storm Rising"
2,Disappointing,"The beginning of the book starts out great, it immediately grabs your attention and keeps you glued to it throughout. However, the ending has got to be the lamest of all time. There was no drama to the end and it seemed to leave me hanging, expecting more. It is a fairly decent book however, it could be much better."
1,Shadow Watch,"This book was absolutely the worst book I have ever read. Tom Clancy is a great author except when he's writing the Power Plays series. All three Power Plays stink. This book never, ever caught my attention, especially with the stupid dream sequences and the stupid plot. The character were horrible. I will not read another Power Plays book."
1,Un-Clancyish,"I am mildly disappointed in Power Plays. It didn't have the ""feel"" of a Tom Clancy novel."
1,Nada to write home about,"Pretty weak effort here, as Clancy puts his imprimatur on another ""Clancy-less"" novel. A few techno insights, as always, but the tepid plot and exceedingly weak ending preclude any real enjoyment. Moreover, the MSRP of $7.99 is massively chutzpah-laden!"
1,Worst Clancy book I have ever read!,"I have read all of Tom Clancy's books including his Op-Center, Net Force and now Power Plays series and this is the worst that Tom has ever put his name on. It was boring, full of filler, such as the dream sequences and the useless information about the people on the train wreck, drawn out to no avail, because they all died a few pages later anyway. I always felt that the Power Plays series was the weakest of the group and this book proves it. I will not read another!"
1,"Lousy, Beyond a shadow of a doubt","I was extremely disappointed with this poorly-written Tom Clancy 'collaboration' novel. I've read 3 superb novels by Tom Clancy, and Shadow Watch differed so greatly from them in terms of content and readability that I have to wonder whether Tom actually contributed to this novel at all!Structurally, the writing was clumsy and obtuse, the plot was stale, and character development virtually non-existent or cliched. I had to force myself to read the novel past the second chapter.My advise: Don't waste your time reading this book."
1,Bad Review,This is absolutely the worst book I have ever read. I want my money back! The one star is actually a negative 10 stars.
1,The poorest collaboration yet,"Shadow Watch is poorly written, pointlessly rambles, inaccurate, fails to resolve the situations opened by the author(s).I find it hard to believe that Tom Clancy read, much less collaborated on this work. I have read and enjoyed all of his fiction and most of the collaborations and, in my opinion, this is the worst.A shuttle explodes on the launch pad. We never really know why or how. There are several dream sequences in the book which have no point I could find. Fortunately, these are italicized and are easy to skip. The cocaine carried on three flatbed trucks is loaded into a Beechcraft Bonanza, a single engine light plane. At the end, the villain, thwarted, simply walks away. He may be seen in a later book but I will never know.The last line of the acknowledgments reads ""But most important, it is for you, my readers, to determine how successful our collective endeavour has been."" For this reader, the endeavour was not successful at all."
3,"Not great, but okay","We bought this for our 9 year old's birthday. I wanted to go with the Schleich castle, but my son really like the blue of this castle. When he open the gift he was thrilled. But once the castle was put together his thrill went down hill. The pieces are flimsy wood and not holding up well to nine year old play. The castle is not sized right for the papo and Schleich knights. Over all I would really give this a 2.5 star rating. Maybe it woudl be fine for children who are very easy on their toys, but it didn't live up to my sons expectations"
3,drawbridge,I LOOKED OVER ALOT OF CASTLES ONLINE AND CHOSE THIS FOR SIZE AND APPEARENCE FOR MY 4 YR.OLD GRANDSON. THE BIG GEST DISMAY WAS A CORNER OF THE DRAWBRIDGE IS BROKEN SO IT FLOPS LOOSE AND THATS HOW IT WAS WHEN WE FIRST ASSEMBLED IT> THE PRICE KEEPS FLUCTUATING TOO.A SOLUTION TO THE KNIGHTS PROBLEM IS BUY A BAG OF O.K.PAINTED KNIGHTS. WOW ARE COWBOY AND INDIAN FIGURES HARD TO FIND BUT A BAGGED SET OF THOSE ARE AVAILABLE TOO
2,"Fun features, but poor quality","Very disappointed in the Excalibur Castle. Don't get me wrong -- the features look like a lot of fun, it is colorful, and every part was in perfect condition when it arrived. HOWEVER, it simply does not have a sturdy design. This entire castle is held together with -- count them -- only 4 screws. Nearly every piece (of which there are about 30) is supposed to stay together through interlocking pieces. Now, this method may be okay for molded plastic, but it doesn't work for the wood pieces in this castle. As a result, when you get the castle together (which was really very simple and took no more than 15 minutes), it is very rickety. All of the pieces shift and move, and you can't relocate the castle without it falling apart. It simply isn't sturdy enough to justify its price tag. I do not recommend it."
3,"Story line good, acting much to be desired.","I was interested in this movie because of my history of working with foster children. It is a very good story. Very real and true to form. But the acting in this movie is not good at all. It seems very fake and forced. The little boy, the foster child is the best of the actors. I would have enjoyed it more of they had hired more experienced actors."
3,"Not a review, a BRIEF summary","An air traffic controller is forced to face the challenge of her life when she has to attempt to guide a dis-abled airplane to a safe landing, not knowing that her hubby is on board."
1,"After those two reviews it's definitely a ""no buy""","Dear Michael,How could you allow a shoddy product to be released? Luckily I DVR'd the David Foster Hit Man program recently on PBS HD, so at least I have a properly recorded segment of you performing until I can buy the Hit Man DVD.If you put out a quality item then people will buy...shame on you and your manager for taking a shortcut. Next thing we know you'll be doing a ""Milli Vanilli"" on us. Bad choice."
5,Michael Blube Blu Ray Caught in the Act,"Great DVD. He is a great entertainer. The Blu Ray version is awesome, almost feels like you are there. Great song list."
5,Review of Michael Buble,This is 5 stars times 2! See my video review on You Tub. Put MrWm2800 in the You Tub Search box and you will bring up this as well as several other Concert Dvd Reviews
3,Wondering about the sound,"I purchased this after reading the reviews but was disappointed that even with a Blu Ray player and HD TV, the quality of the music was great but Michael's voice fell in the background. Perhaps it is my sound system but I found the concert to be great just the same. For those with an older stereo system, the sound quality is not great."
5,Great video and well recorded sound.,I only buy concerts on video if they are recorded and mixed well. This one is good.
5,Blow-You-Away Voice,Do not hesitate to pick up the blu-ray of this concert if you are even considering it. The quality is excellent and the performance is show-stopping. This will make you a bigger fan of the Buble.
5,The best film guide period,"This is the single best guide to film ever made; and the biggest flaw is that they've never made another sequel for recent movies.This book can be enjoyed on two levels; on one hand, it is a film review book that has rated many different movies out there, and it is also excellent satire. I've actually bought movies that were recommended by this book.In short, if you like movies, get this book."
3,"Read the book, just don't see the movies","I've gotta say that the book is a million times better than the actual movies they recommend. A couple years ago my friend and I made the mistake of taking the authors' word on a few of their ""Unsung Heroes"" picks. Perhaps the The Element of Crime paid off in the end, but it was one of the few flicks I never managed to watch all of. (Apparently most of Lar Von Trier's movies are like that.) And even though I did manage to watch all of The Last Wave, I didn't enjoy it, much less find the ending ""mind-blowing"". Maybe they were so high they were imagining a better movie than the one that was actually playing."
2,Not up to par with others,"My son loved the Letter Factory and especially the Talking Word Factory. Since getting the Talking Word Factory he suddenly is interested in reading, and is trying to sound out words constantly - it was a great purchase.This one, however, did not capture his attention (although it is meant for kids a little older) or interest him. I also thought the concepts they were focusing on were not all that useful or well presented.In short - we don't like it."
1,going in the trash,"If you don't mind your kids watching men dress like girls for theater then this may not be bad for you. I know that in the old days that is how they did things. I however, have two boys who I don't need to watch Mr Frog dress like a girl with lip stick and all. Also, they changed the characters voices. I am wondering if they were bought out and changed everything."
5,Leap Frog - Learn to Read at the Storybook Factory,My son loves this video and it has helped him learn some of the basic fundamentals about reading. I would definitely recommend this video.
1,DO NOT BUY -- COMPREHENSION OF WHAT?,"I couldn't see the educational value of this video due to all of the ""cross-gender"" scenes as well as things that made the boys look inferior. Examples are: Lily is director, boy pig messes up, makeup robot applies lipstick to Dad frog, Dad frog is the ""Mama Pig"" in the play, punctuation band has Prof. Quigley with long hair, boy pig jumps in arms of girl pig twice, boy wolf is Dot. Later Dot is the giant in Jack & The Beanstalk.Very disappointed in this DVD, since Letter Factory, Talking Words Factory (1 & 2) and Math Circus were SO GOOD. I would not let my boys watch this DVD. It's a shame that parents have to screen educational videos for such a young age."
5,Reading ready,"Love, love, this product. I can't believe how quickly the children (2 year old twins) learn their letters and are able to recognize words after watching this video only a couple of times. Definately worth every penny."
3,Not as good as the other Leap Frog videos.,"This video was okay and my children have enjoyed it, but it just isn't as good and educational as the earlier videos. Teaches a few literary elements."
2,Eh,"This was a good video for my son to watch, but he didn't learn anything from it. I purchased it because the first video in the series (Talking Letters Factory) was amazing."
5,If the kids like it!,My grandchildren choose this video to watch and then go around singing the songs all day. They laugh and interact with the video while it is playing.
1,Very disappointing!!!,"This is definitely not for kids who are starting to read. The words are going across the screen too fast. My 5 yr old had difficulty keeping up. As an adult, had i not known the story, i could not follow.I do applaud the fact that it talks about punctuation (use of comma's and full stops) but then that is basically it.It lacked the depth and interest of the talking letter factory.Had i read the other reviews first on this one, i would have never bought it."
2,Sadly disappointed,"We loved The Letter Factory and The Talking Words Factory, we expected to like this one too. The introduction to the ""learning part"" was almost ten minutes long (or almost a third of the video) of just fluff, no skills presented. The actual ""learning part"" was closed captioning with the words highlighted as they were read. There was no explanation of how to sound out the words (other than a quick plug of the Letter and Word Factory), Tad knew all the words- in this video he just was learning how to chunk them together. A better choice would be to watch PBS's Super Why. Very sadly disappointed Leap Frog."
5,Fun to watch 3 yr LOVE to learn!,Leap Frog - Learn to Read at the Storybook FactoryMy grandson is 3 yrs old & absolutely loves this dvd. He laughs & learns the letters & is enthralled! fun to watch him!!
1,NFS Most Wanted-Black Edition,"Ordered this game for Xbox 360 that's what it was listed under. When I received it it was the wrong one, only for Xbox not 360. But it was resolved & got a refund."
4,Very nice,"I love this game. It's a blast to race in and to drive around. But I still find that NFSU...the first one...had a lot more excitement and fun in it. Even though MW is a blast, it no where compares to NFSU. I do love the free roam. I believe free roam should be a must in any game. To be able to take your modified ride and just cruise around...that's nice indeedy! =) But MW is an extremely well-made game with a good amount of attention to detail. For NFS fans, I highly recommend it. If you haven't bought NFSU part 1 yet, I recommend it first."
5,This game is great,"This is definately a game worth your money. If you're a fan of the other need for speed games you will probably love this one. This is all about the cops. Get chased, wreck things and you'll have no problem with the game. You say the game is too short, it's not. There are multiple game types and you can play it over and over and never have the same chase. Overall this is a great game."
2,Get the others -- not this one,"Volume I and Volume III of the Sacred Treasures CDs are marvelous -- beautiful music performed in wonderful acoustical settings. Unfortunately, this one is not of the same caliber. Instead of presenting the Allegri as it was written (for voices), each movement has an additional contemporary part with a Cornetto, an out-of-tune brass instrument. The thrills that started the pieces are destroyed by this addition. Let the music stand on its own."
1,Big Disappointment,"I was very disappointed with this selection. I mean, who in the right mind would use a TRUMPET SOLO for a choral CD? And the soprano solo sounded like she was in some kind of physical pain. I just couldn't believe my ears. I kept listening, hoping that maybe, just maybe, the next one would be better, but no such luck. The entire disc was a disappointment.If you are looking for a nice choral CD with pretty sopranos, I recommend the Sacred Treasures Volume 4, which I got in a hurry to help me recover from the horrors of Volume 2. I found the other volumes (the Russian chorals) to be too baritone for me."
5,Meditative and Deeply Moving,"With respect to those who have negatively critiqued this CD, I wish to add to this forum my heartfelt praise. When one pauses to consider the ancient roots of this music, and the sanctity of the place to which it solely belonged for so many years, its depth and richness magnify. When one goes further, and allows oneself to sit still and breathe in the echoing precision of the voices so hauntingly mixed with brass, this work's magic may most fully be worked on the listener. And it is my belief that there is a certain mysteriuos quantity of magic in the Miserere. It requests that it's beholder be silent and let its meditative depth spread out like a slowly rippling body of water, and pad out the noise and the internal chatter of the mind. I find that this music is aptly titled ""Sacred."" And to me at least, it has been a treasure. I hope some others will allow themselves to connect with it as I have."
2,don't waste your time...,"Unless you're really into new age versions of choral masterpieces, don't bother with this CD. It's drivel."
2,disappointing and ear piercing........,"I have I, III, IV and love them, but found II ear piercing and annoying.The choral was wonderful, but the ear piercing instrument very distracting.I don't know if it is the acoustics of the Sistine Chapel which may be fine for choral, but obviously not for this brassy instrument they used.I wonder why nobody noticed it as it was reviewed?As I prepare this review, I am listening to V and find it as enjoyable as I, III, and IV.Would NOT recommend this CD to anyone who cares about sacred music."
5,A truly wonderful experience.,"This work that has it's roots in 17th century church music, but has an all together contemporary feel to it. The mixture of the boys vocals and the brass is mysterious, provacative and inspiring all at once. A fairly unigue audio experience. I would by lots more of this kind of thing if it were avaiable. This is a real treat. Don't miss it."
3,"It's OK for some, just not for me!!","I was disappointed with this CD. I'm not that fond of a Cornetto instrument and it ruins the choral parts, at least to me it does. I love Sacred Treasures I and III, with it's awesome reverbent and airy choral tones, but II didn't offer near as much and like I said, was ruined in vocal sound by interuptions with an annoying Cornetto, which takes away from the overall loveliness from this type of wonderful music."
1,NOT the SAME!!,"I received Sacred Treasures 11 some time ago and of all the others (ST3,4,5,1) this was the best. I cannot find my copy, so I ordered another one. It is NOT the same! The cornets dominate, very LITTLE choral, and there were some unmistakable very low bass voices in the first one. In short, it was magnificent. This is not a shadow of the other! Was I wrong or mistaken? if someone knows, email me. There was a passage (which was unmistakeable) where the basses sounded like the Australian ""didgeridoo""?? ~ I don't have my spellcheck. Can someone identify the Sacred Treasure this one is? I am very disappointed.(where is the CHORAL? ~ a little here, a little there. ARGH!"
2,Why the instruments?,"I really enjoyed many of the pieces, but the saxophone/trumpet/etc. ruined it for me."
1,"OK, I love Bittner...but","Lawless Love, Hearts Surrender, Texas Embrace, etc are all favorites so I was expecting kind of the same with this book. But I guess this one fits more into the historical fiction category instead of hist. romance because I could NOT get past the fact that the heroine's husband had to sleep with another woman because the heroine could not have a child by him. Oh this just ruined the book for me."
5,"the only book i have ever read that made cry, Love the book.",This book made me love my life even more. My life and dreams are one and the same with Medicine Wolf. I see myself in her. she made me happy and sad at the same time. I felt the joys and the pains she felt in the book. My ancesters were of her line. The ending made me cry and also joyful that she was with her loved ones. She is a very beautiful woman and very strong. Her love for Bear Paw was written in the stars and had to happen. I LOVED THE BOOK. I want to read more of this history. Thank You for such a well written book. May the Spirit of the Wolf lead you to the happy hunting grounds. Your Friend Canwayopata Kay
5,A rare read,"Song of the Wolf has made it nearly impossible for any other book to come close to being a good read! I have never cried or laughed out loud while reading, even though I might have enjoyed whatever book I was reading at the time. I was truly touched by this book as no other. I just happened to check it out at the library and now, I can't find it so that I can purchase it to lend out or to keep for enjoyable reading later."
4,Perfect,"These foam frisbees really met the needs of my students. They are very durable. They have survived children stepping on them, bending and striking to the ground. The best part is when someone gets hit it by the frisbee it results in a giggle instead of pain. I have several Adapted P.E. students who are afraid of catching. The frisbees game them a terrific opportunity to throw and catch a different objects without the fear of injury. They are dense so they dont fly as true as a real frisbee but for my situations they were perfect."
1,Barron's CLEP is garbage,"I have been trying to study for the English Comp test. I used the provided CD. I took the Sample Test 1 (with scoring), when I finished it said ""Go to answer key."" But there is none and when I went looking for it all of my answers are gone. 90 minutes completely wasted! DON'T BUY ANY BARRON'S PREP BOOKS FOR THE CD! They are garbage and don't work. I have tried several experiments trying to find any answer key. It just doesn't exist -- it's a lie, and all your answers are lost forever.-Kurt-BTW, we should be allowed to put no stars. None are deserved here."
4,Loved it!!,"We bought this bicycle for our son's 3rd birthday. He LOVED the bright colors and the fact that it has somewhere for his horses to ride! It has taken a little while for him to get used to the training wheels, but the bike stays steady while he is riding and doesn't threaten to tip. We are very happy with this bicycle."
4,There is only one way if you're white,"Maybe Satisfying the Black Woman Sexually Made Simple is easy if you are coloured and have what it takes ""downstairs.' But if you are white there is only one way to do it:Enlargement surgery."
2,This is a fairly good book.,I did enjoy reading this book but I don't know why she felt the need to cuss in a few places in the book.
2,Skip This One...,"The author's biggest mistake was to use her own photographs on the back cover. Were these meant to be funny? She's dressed appallingly, awesomely, awfully.It's tedious reading, with more emphasis on the theoretical, ""scientific"" study of the ""politics"" behind retail clothing sales than I, for one, am interested in. I didn't care for her tone, either, or the crude language.Finally, I found her requirements for building a good wardrobe to be on the expensive side - because of this I don't think most people will be able to make use of her recommendations."
3,A good start to wardrobe basics,"This is a good basic start up guide to women who need help in refining their wardrobe, learn about fabrics, etc. The author shares her personal ideas on what to buy and when. Included in this book are tips on:**style**retail secrets**wardrobe building**basics**accessories**trendsHer suggestions are a little impractical for those not in a business environment (one of her tips is to buy 1 suit per season). She bases her wardrobe on jackets/blazers and suits/skirts. This may not be practical for the younger, more casual urban girl. But for those wanting to look more polished and put together, this book can give you a good start."
3,Worth a quick read - but don't buy it,"Do read the first half which is about the working of the fashion/ clothing/footwear industries - it'll help you decide what to make of anything full price at a fancy department store. The book also has sound advise on how to estimate what you should really be paying for things at retailers, discounters, outlets, etcSkip the part where she gives wardrobe advice though - complete waste of time for anyone who cannot afford $ 1000 handbags !"
5,Further lessons,"I learned alot from this book. While the practical guidlines of setting up spiritist centers akin to the ones in Brazil doesn't relate to me, I found it illuminating. She presents the interworkings of 5 centers in Brazil that feature different healing practices, and different leaders who might have slightly varying philosophies, but all of which share the basic spiritist principles. I am especially interested in the role of mediumship within spiritism, ie John of God, which the author has previously written about. I recommend ""Surgeon with the Rusty Knife"" and ""The Quantum Surgeon""."
5,It's a filter,What kind of review would you expect to see on a filter? It filters my air just great!
3,Performance great but recording is OLD,"I agree with all of the good things people said. Especially about Carreras-he is young and beyond words in his singing....The problem is is that this dvd (which was made in 2011) was made from a 1978 video. the audio is high quality, the visuals are a little dark... Also there are 3 or 4 places where the dvd just stops (pauses) and then continues. I bought this new in September. I think that these pauses are due to the video recording. I had similar things happen when i transferred family videos to dvd...with this, i still recommend this dvd"
4,achat conforme,"article arrivé un peu tardivement et frais de transports un peu trop élevés.article conforme a celui commandé, arrivé en état neuf sous son film plastifié."
2,"Are you kidding? This performance (abridged, thank God) is pretty bad.","Suliotis is all wrong for this- the rest of the cast is boring- the sets are like a high school production... maybe it's because i heard Milanov in this role many times and then Price but jeeeeeezzzz- this ain't a Forza i can say anything good about, Sorry kids- dem's my feelings."
3,Not as nice as I had hoped,"Not as nice as I had hoped, smaller than I expected and arrived later than when I needed them. : / They tasted OK, not as good as the Belgian chocolates with hazelnut filling - more than 2 dozen for $6 at Cost Plus."
2,Lackluster shave for the price,"I have used both the Mach 3 and the Mach 3 Turbo razors and so I decided to give the Power version a try as well. I expected an improvement over the shave I get with the Mach 3 Turbo. I have been trying it for about a week now and overall have decided that the Power is not worth the extra cost. I don't feel it gives me a better shave than the Mach 3 Turbo and I will not be purchasing additional blades once the ones that it came with wear out.In addition to the lackluster shave, I found that I often turned the razor off by accident due to the poor location of the power button. I also did not really like the feel of the vibrating razor on my jaw because the vibration is transmitted right to the ear drums which is annoying.In summary, I don't think that the Mach 3 Power is worth the extra cost. If you are looking for an improved shave, I would recommend trying the Schick Quattro instead because I think gives a better shave than any of the Mach 3 razors."
4,What WIll They Think of Next?,"Some men look for the Seven Pillars of Wisdom. Some seek the Holy Grail. Others are searching for a heart. I'm just looking for a better shave, and I think I've hit the jackpot with this new gizmo from Gillette. It's kind of like shaving in one of those vibrating lounge chairs, only much easier. The vibrations definitely produce a closer and more comfortable shave than other Mach 3 products. That might be partly because these vibrations force you to slow down--a good face saving technique with any shaving system. One problem for me was finding the camouflaged on/off switch. Fool that I am, I couldn't figure out how to turn it off and practically disassembled the handle as a result. The other problem is replacement blades, which are very pricey and will surely force me into deficit spending. But then how much is a great shave worth?"
5,Ingenious!,"I had to trash my electric razor because the thing irritated my skin too much, so I thought this would be a good time to try this razor. I was delighted. Because it vibrates, you can shave a little more slowly, since the razor does some of the work for you. The first time I used it, I used slow, smooth strokes. My skin was very smooth, there was no sign of irritation, and not a nick or a cut anywhere. Fantastic.No shaver is perfect for everybody, but this one suits me better than any razor ever has."
5,Great Shave,This thing is unbelievable. I thought that at almost $15 it wouldn't be worth it over a Mach III or III turbo but I was wrong. As previous reviewers have noted it makes shaving sensitive areas (above the lip) or several days growth painless. I have sensitive skin and decided to test the razor out by going against the grain. There is absolutely no problem shaving against the grain due to the vibration.
1,WTF?!,"Good gawd...this thing is expensive for a freakin' razor!And expensive doesn't always equate to better. My experience with the Gillette M3Power proves that statement to be correct.This razor does not shave any better (or worse) than the Mach 3. I fail to see how the vibrating factor enhances the shaving experience. The shave with the M3Power was neither closer nor more comfortable than using the Mach 3.I enjoy testing new razors when they hit the market, and I'm just glad I bought this overpriced and overhyped gadget on sale. The signficantly higher price for refill razor heads compared to the Mach 3 refills is insane!Save your money and do not buy this overpriced gimmick.And to all those suckers, excuse me, I mean...consumers who buy and continue to use this razor believing you're getting an improved shave: The executives at Gillette thank you for making their paychecks fatter."
2,Some Concerns,This is a vibrating razor. Don't we cut ourselves enough without a little lop-sided motor in the handle?You can purchase this product used.Need I say more?
1,Sounds like a good idea... but how about durability of it?,"If I'm wrong, I'll change my review to 5 stars and beg eternal forgiveness. But this looks like the sort of kids' toy that breaks after a few net hours' worth of use. That's the trouble with micromechanics under macroinfluence; they're not always tolerable.A+ for the actual idea. I've always loved the Mach 3 system (I use the Turbo these days - smooth, baby, smooth) and, in conecpt, I like it. I've been tempted to try it, especially with others saying how great it is.But the ruling is out on durability; short-term or otherwise. The low low price doesn't inspire me to think of it any higher either. I'd wait and find out just how long these little buggers will last before plonking $15 on it.(Off-note to anyone of authority in the marketing division reading:) Now if only someone would invent a reliable razor sharpening mechanism for those razors, we wouldn't need to fill hundreds of landfills with non-biodegradeable hazardous rubbish. ;-)"
5,"Woww, the most amazing shave I've ever had!","I was sceptical like the rest of you guys, but couldn't resist not giving it a try.Simply amazing, what an innovation this is! wow.I thought I'd give it a try using one of my old Mach3 Turbo blades ( a used one) and even that gave me an amazing shave, it almost doesn't feel like you are having a shave at all, no irritation, just a smooth and clean shave - and I know thats what they all claim - but the Mp3 razor has to tried to be seen, I have just tried it with the new PowerGlide blade and I can confess that I have never had such a clean looking shave, even my family and friends have noticed the difference.Wow, its amazing to think that just a vibrating handle can make such a difference to a razor.I am most impressed! Keep it up, Gillette."
3,Mach 3 is just as good and cheaper.,"Vibrating razors are nothing new. I had a Stahley in the 50's which I used with Gillette Twin Blades. Loved it, but they were expensive and broke often. Since then, I've moved up the line from Trak to Mach and even a Schic k thrown in here and there. So when I saw the M3Power, I had to try it. The shave isn't as good as the Mach 3; the grip isn't quite as comfortable; and I found that I felt as though I had to go over some spots that were still stubbly."
3,Not bad...not amazing either,"I was excited about the arrival of the M3Power, but after 10 days of shaving with it, I've reached a verdict: Cool, but not really better.My beard is very thick and tough as nails, but the shave with the M3Power wasn't any better than the Sensor or Mach3 products. Granted, the vibration feels good against your face--especially first thing in the morning--but I think it makes it feel like it's doing more than it actually is."
1,I Don't Get It,"I have sensetive skin and a thick beard. I had been using the Schick Quatro, and not necessarily thrilled with it.I tried the M3 Power. Is this thing just a sick joke? I bled all over the place like a stuck pig! unless there is a trick to using this thing (and yes, i turned it ON), it feels more like a cheese grater than a razor. If there IS a trick to it, please let me know."
5,Switching From Electric?,"This is a great razor for someone who is used to an electric shaver. I switched from electric to the M3 because the gillete brand washs, gel, and aftershave will be much better for my skin. My electric shaver constantly gave me bumps, and irritated areas. But anyway, I've tried to switch before, but couldnt do it even with a mach 3 turbo i used before the electric. The M3 is great, it gave my face the vibrating motion it was used to and was incredibly gentle."
3,Personal Preference,"Make no mistake: if you didn't like this design before, the fact that it vibrates won't change your preference. If you did like it before, you'll probably like this one too.Personally, I prefer the Sensor design. The Sensor3 is a slight but noticeable improvement over the Sensor Excel. So it seems possible that a well-done 3-blade design can produce less irritation.Everybody's different, and the moral of the story is that you have to try razor designs until you find the one that works best for you. Once you do, these sorts of evolutionary improvements are not going to make you change horses in midstream.RichC"
5,"Dubious at first, now a believer!","I accidentally bought this one instead of a replacement handle for my Mach 3 blades and initially was annoyed at spending the extra money. After a week of shaving, I'm a believer. Consistent, smooth, and close shaves. Enough of a difference that I bought a lot of replacement blades."
4,"Worth trying, I have switched for good","It looked like hype to me, but based on the past accoladed of gillette with their mach 3, I gave it a shot. I loved it. It's nothing more than a fast vibrating razor, but the shaking allows the blade to cut through hairs easier, with an additional sawing like motion. This means better shaves with older blades.I'm hooked and will continue to use it. However, I don't plan on buying the overpriced m3power blades. I'm sticking with the standard, non turbo blades. Works just as well."
2,"Good, not Great","First, let me say this - this is a good razor, don't be fooled by the rating I gave it.But the problem is, even at nearly twice the price of the regular Mach 3, it's not any better.The bottom line is - the Mach 3 is a good razor, Gillette makes good products, and this is no exception. But if you're debating between the Mach 3 and the M3Power, or thinking about upgrading, this isn't the way to go... if you're expecting this to give a closer, smoother, more comfortable shave, you're going to be suprised. The battery power vibrating thing really seems to just be a gimmick. It's got all the ability of the Mach 3, but nothing more."
1,Unreadably Awful Psalm Translation,"This book uses an indescribably vapid Dick-and-Jane Reader translation of the psalms, one that's utterly devoid of poetry, music and majesty -- a translation even less beautiful than the Roman breviary's ""Grail"" translation, if that can be imagined."
1,pop science,"I was interested in discovering true debate among equals regarding certain ""archaeological facts"" as promised. However, quickly into the book I discovered that the debate was not among equals and the authors' questions often omitted substantive scientific support for the current postion. This book would be best classified under the title: Pop archeological fiction. It seemed like a covert way of introducing intelligent design into a scientific argument."
4,Never Forget....,"This is a small book that is filled with color photos of the tragedy of September 11, 2001. This is a book that I recommend for anyone who is in the process of studying the horror of that day. A picture really is worth a thousand words."
1,Dissappointing.,"""The First Days of Christianity"" is, on the whole, not worth the money. The only possible exception would be free copies.The first part covers the ""Holy Family"". It uses the Gnostic Gospels as a reliable source despite the nearly universal rejection of them by modern reputable scholership. As a result, the first portion of this poorly executed attempt at an entertaining biography is largely innaccurate and biased. The reenactments of loosely related miracle accounts are worthy of a high school play at best. If you do choose to buy this, don't even bother with the first section.The second part is a head and shoulders improvement over the first, but it still falls far short of a well done documentary. It clearly favors an atheist (or at the very least agnostic) viewpoint in reporting the history of the very early church. As the timeline becomes more removed from Jesus and the history becomes less controversial, the documentary improves considerably."
1,Save Your Money,See J. Lane Review I have same thought. Not at all educational.Read the reviews people before you buy. That was my forgottenmistake on this purchase. Nothing against the seller they were great..
1,The First Days of Christianity (History Channel Ultimate Collections) (2008),"Warning this is a very inferior title on the subject !The set is made up of two very different History Channel documentaries1: ""In the Footsteps of the Holy Family"" this title is on the par with an amateur Christmas pageant, its only professional is the aging actor Robin Moore. Complete with extremely poorly done reenactments totally devoid of facts and in some cases context. In many cases footsteps has a distasteful political slant bordering on propaganda. Many of the so called Miracles are laughable lacking even internal creditability. My personal favorite was a tale of a General Harper of the Egyptian Army(?).2. The Apostles Collection is by far the better of the two titles. Narrated by Martin Sheen, its production values make it at least watchable.I will have to admit the packaging of this 4 disc Boxed set is a work of art"
1,not what I thought,I love history and usually the products are pretty good....this was not what I thought it would be. It really has nothing to do with the first days of the Christian Faith. It's really just one testamony after another.
5,"Excellent book on Troy's life, to be a football star.","Excellent book for all young athletes wanting to be a supper star like there hero. The ups and downs Troy had as he was growing up and especially what his mother told him about being a good sport. He learned behavior is one thing you could change and he would never bad-mouth another player. I bought the book for my grandson who is a big Troy Aikman fan. My grandson loves playing sports and originaly lived in California and has move to Oklahoma, he is 10 years old."
4,An Excellent Behind-the-Scenes Look,"""Gang of Five"" is an excellent, behind-the-scenes look at five individuals who played a large part in shaping the Republican power structure as we know it today. Although the book was written nearly six years ago, Easton's insightful journalism is especially relevant due to the Jack Abramoff scandal. Abramoff plays a large part in the book, as he ran the College Republicans with pals Grover Norquist and Ralph Reed.To understand the Republican Party, you must read this book. Easton's knowledge spans the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton years, and goes beyond the personalities you see in the media to paint a picture of a party rooted in college activism, philosophy, and a desire to push the country to the Right.This book comes highly recommend to anyone interested in our political strucutre, Republican or Democrat."
5,Pockets - favorite kid's book,"I read this book a few years ago and forgot neither the beautiful illustrations nor the touching story. I was thrilled to be able to order it from here (as I couldn't find it ANYWHERE), and it will remain one of my all-time favorites always!"
3,"Ehhh, it's ok",Beautifully illustrated but not so sure about the story. I thought the ending was kind of lacking. I think I would have rated the story as a 1. I would recommend going to the library for this one.
5,"Cruel, but it's human nature!",""" Despair "" really touches me. I can experience how Robin feels. Once famous "" the most promising star "" now an outcast and forgotten by showbiz. A downhill career and lack of love, Robin seek consolation from a humanform, very rare species lizard named Medusa. Deep down in his illusion ignoring the outside world. Robin was no more remembered. When he failed the final audition, He lost all the hopes to live, part of curiosity maybe part of suicide attempt, He took the final act regardless of Count D's warning...... On the solemn funeral those betrayers condolences for him, praised how great he could be if not died so young, only lip service, these people deprive of his last opportunity, and these whispers might gone with the wind quickly, soon will be forgotten. At least Medusa be his companion. Maybe it's love.This could be a spoiler to diminish your fun to enjoy it, I'm trying to express my feeling. A deep story. Besides, the animation and the music both good too."
2,Not so great,"It is true this story has very little to do with Christmas other than that is when the story ends. It may be that this is the first story I have read by the author but, I thought the writing style was juvenile (especially the short, choppy sentences), the character development very shallow and the characters rather like stick figures moving about, drawing no emotion from the reader at all. It is a quick read but I did not think an enjoyable one."
2,Refrigerator Poetry,"There are poems by Merwin that I like, really like, but they aren't in this book.His style here is hard to get inside. He writes three lines then a dash then three lines through the whole book, and his diction sounds like refrigerator poetry -- very imagistic, very noun-heavy.Each poem feels difficult to put together into a real poem, not just a list of images and sparse ideas. Too difficult. I didn't like it much."
5,"Poignant, haunting, memorable....a ""must-watch.""","This is one of the three documentaries about Iraq that were nominated for the ""Best DoOcumentary Feature"" Academy Award. All three films were riveting, but this one is the most personal, the most touching and the most artistic. You meet the authors in interviews, and find out their background story, as well as what prompted them to write about their experiences. Famous actors then read that writing as the filmmakers illustrate the stories in a variety of different ways....still photography, animation, footage shot by soldiers, etc. This film is visually compelling and emotionally powerful; non-partisan; human. It simply tells some of the stories of the men and women who serve - what they see, what they feel, and what they experience. The film is poetic, beautiful and should be seen by every American, regardless of political affiliation."
3,Robbery,"It is not my intention to discredit the music contained in these two cd set, at the contrary: it is music of the highest rank. This time I will not review the music but the edition. I adore the recordings of ECM house, but I quite claim for the stinginess and miserliness of the recording time in both discs of this set. How is it possible that disc one contains only 44 minutes and the second just 34! It is a steal that costs more than 34 dollars. ECM easily could have edit the works of both, Carter and Yun in one disc. Perhaps some people will think that the mean is me, but I consider that the recording houses must not abuse even they present extraordinary works such as these."
1,ECM's chintzy playing times,"I'm getting sorely tired of ECM's chintzy playing times. They're charging full-price for a two-cd release whose total playing time is 81 minutes. That will fit on a single cd. I'm giving this release a pass, despite my admiration for several of the featured musicians (Zehetmair, Holliger, Demenga) and my interest in the repertoire."
2,Might Ears Won't Adjust,"Having listened to this numerous times, I can only come to the conclusions that my ears will need much more education if they are to like this style on music, but at the same time, I well appreciate the musical skill of performance here. I risked purchasing this with both purposes in mind, having the highest regard for Holliger.Some of the Carter compositions easily conform to what I like to listen to, while I'm afraid the Yun selections sound like whale communication to me.I will continue the experiment though, and listen with an open mind and ear."
2,disappointing,"He traces the history of kimono adequately. However, the vast majority of the pictures are black-and-white, and the main pleasure of viewing kimono is the intricate colors and textures. Also, he spent far too much time on kabuki kimono rather than on formal women's kimono, which are much more beautiful and interesting."
2,Basic kids book,It's not bad for a child's book on kimono but it could be better. The information on early kimono is scant to nonexistant.
5,18th Century Terrorists,"Thanks to Dennis Spooner's portrayal of the French Revolution in Reign of Terror, we get to see what a bloodthirsty lot the peasants were. Not being satisfied with simply taking over the government and banishing the aristocracy from France, those animals showed their savagery by guillotining everyone, even innocent woman and children. The Doctor and his group materializes right in the middle of the French Revolution and are immediately captured by peasant soldiers and condemned to death, only to be saved by the real heroes, Jules Renan and his friend Jean, representing the Scarlet Pimpernel. Fortunately, Reign is spared much sadness by not focusing on the executions, but instead on the Doctor's attempts to rescue his captive friends, and then the fall of the Robespierre and rise of Napoleon to power. The ending of Reign is poignant indeed, with the Doctor stating ""Our destiny is in the stars."" Carry on Doctor. Keep on educating, as well as entertaining, us."
5,FitBall Review,My second FitBall. The first one lasted five years. I sit on it at work at my desk. Much more comfortable than a chair. Standard chairs now feel like butt flattening devices.
2,Not interested in the truth,"There are two glaring problems with Philip Johnson and his ilk: They start from the logical fallacy that to discredit Darwinian evolution would somehow prove creationism right. WRONG. They would still have to produce evidence for their theory which they will never be able to do. Secondly, they try to disprove evolution by pointing to the fact that there is not enough evidence in the fossil record. Not enough evidence? This is humorous considering that they are advocating a position that has zero evidence to support it. The Intelligent Design crowd is not interested in the truth. They are only concerned with the metaphysical implications of scientific materialism. If you prefer consoling delusions to truth, then this book is for you. Otherwise, it is a waste of time."
3,I'm so tired of this...,"This book defends position one of a two position debate with some okay words. Other books have defended the second side of the argument with some okay words as well. As for me? I'm sick of the entire thing. My opinion is that if there is STILL this much controversy over this issue, then BOTH sides must be flawed somehow. If there are clearly flaws in both, then where is the truth? THAT is the book I'd like to read.... But this ain't it. Read this if you still want to stay in the old debate, running in circles forever."
1,Sophistry by any other name...,"Through a flurry of misconceptions, sweeping assertions and selective presentations of the facts, all while under the veil of 'baloney detection' to seem as a reasonable and unbiased author, Johnson proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is a lawyer and not a biologist. He wants to convince people that he knows the facts, instead of wanting to know the facts. Full of obfuscation and internal inconsistencies, this book is extremely slick, and will undoubtedly leave the uncritical reader thinking that the notion of evolution is in academic disarray. Nothing could be further from the truth."
1,Ridiculous,"This guy blathers on about how science should be approached from a neutral perspective with an opened mind and without preconceptions. Fine. Nothing wrong with that. But then he totally contradicts himself by proposing that the basis of scientific investigation should be the supernatural beliefs of one particular Christian sect.I think aliens came here in UFOS and populated planet earth. They used special ray guns that turned animals into rocks and that's where fossils came from. Fossils exists don't they? So there's proof of my alien theory. It makes just as much sense as ""intelligent design"". Hey, the aliens were the ""intelligent designers"". That makes sense to me and I have just as much evidence for it as creationist/IDers do for what they propose. I want that taught in schools too."
1,Only effective for True Believers.,"Those who never intend to accept modern evolutionary theory will lap up this book, and continue to congratulate themselves that somehow ""the tide is turning"" toward their head-in-the-sand viewpoint.However, those who intend to use the scientific method to make practical advances in the biological and earth sciences will find little--if anything--of value among Johnson's arguments."
1,No real content here.,"Johnson never gets to the details of his arguments. The book is simply an attempt to shove Christianity onto science. He starts out insisting that God belongs in science without really saying why. He never points out an area of science that needs God, except he keeps mentioning evolution in that connection. But the lack of details makes this book unconvincing even for its intended audience. If this is the best creationists have to offer, science has nothing to worry about (except the stupid, ignorant public). The book amounts to one long, boring whine. He shows you can write competently without actually having a brain."
1,"Do check out his ""references""","And you'll find quote mining, quotes taken out of context, deliberate distortions, and other falsities.Why do creationists have to ""lie for Jesus?"""
3,I cannot belive this,"I can't belive this after 200 years of evalution some people are still doubtfull.When Jesus began preaching people took him for granted at first but evntually they belived.The Church burned those who belived the earth revolves around the sun.I hope People will evetually open up their eyes. I do like this book because I am always open to new opinions ,even if they contradict my one.This is a great book for debating and everyone should have it."
1,Poorly written propaganda,"I just picked this up in a library book sale and I must say that I wish I had my $0.15 back. It looks like there's at least one fallacy or falsehood on every page. Johnson briefly addresses some fallacies he thinks he's encountered in dealing with scientists, but somehow he fails to see that the very same fallacies permeate his writing. I've seen more coherent and eloquent arguments for creationism on free websites. I'm no longer a creationist and I'm convinced that creationism in our times is essentially a conjecture based on ignorance and faulty reasoning. But even if I was still a creationist, I think I would be disappointed by the dumbed-down approach of the book."
2,watered down,"This was an unecessary book. It is simply a watered down version of Darwin on Trial. This book leaves out the evidence of the scientific flaws of Darwinism that Darwin on Trial contained. Also be warned, Johnson is not a 6 day creationist nor is he a scientist like Duane Gish. He is more in line with intellegent design. You can decide if that is a good or bad thing."
1,"A sad, misinformed irony.","It is unfortunate that the scope of some concepts are simply beyond the average person who is not willing to devote more that several hours to learning about it. It is ironic that creationists are so concerned with the ""Truth,"" without taking much time to look for it. An ""open mind"" means to look at all sides of the issue before you draw even a tentative, not a final, conclusion. Therefore, if you believe in the importance of an ""open mind,"" as this book purports to espouse, you will be interested to read the other side of the story as well. May I suggest a work by a biologist, rather than a lawyer (as this author is). Read Richard Dawkins' ""The Blind Watchmaker"" before you place too much faith (as it were) on this bit of deceptive misrepresentation."
5,A Must Read!,"The critical thinking skills described in this book have beenextremely valuable to me. They have helped in dealing with the ...... that is reported today in the media, especially the conclusions of ""Scientific Experts"" in the area of origins research. I recommend this book to those who don't want to be taken in by the arguments of pseudo-scientists plying their philosophical ........I recommend a read of this book to help you arm yourself in discerning the truth from the propaganda!"
1,Peeing into the wind . . . . .,"Evolution is supported by mountains and mountains of documented, irrefutable evidence from educated, professional, intelligent people who have simply followed the course of where their research took them. It's no longer about one guy who wrote one book in the mid-1800's. Not any more. Inform yourselves, people. I challenge anyone reading this to actually investigate how much supporting research there is out there for evolution in science, in astronomy, biology geology and physics. It's overwhelming. Check out some web sites from some universities and research institutes to get an idea of how research is being done on evolution all over the world. Do you think they're all in a conspiracy, and that they're just making it all up?"
1,Anti-science for pre-college students,"This book is worse than the ignorant letters to the editor creationists write to my hometown newspaper. Johnson must know that his arguments have discredited; yet he presents them to an audience of high school biology students. Any knowledgeable teacher will be able to refute these arguments, much to the embarrassment of the student. Unfortunately, the real intent of books like this is to intimidate teachers into not presenting modern science to their classes."
5,Defeating Darwinism by opening minds,"The tide is turning, cracks and weaknesses are beginning to show in darwinist theory, while the case for Biblical creationsim contunues to grow stronger. This book will equip the reader with information and stategies for going toe-to-toe confidently and successfully with darwinists. Truth prevails over theory. It is an excellent apologetics primer."
2,A Scary Piece of Propaganda,"I have just read several of Phillip E. Johnson's books on creationism and found some of them interesting. This book, however, is problematic. This book is intended as a book for high school students and is designed to counter biology class presentations on evolution. Sadly, it is shallow and biased, it presents incomplete and unfair arguments against evolution. It presents thoroughly discredited arguments just as if they were not fraught with problems. It saddens me to think of young minds reading this without having oppurtunity to see the complete picture. Don't get me wrong, there are intellectually honest, interesting presentations of creationism out there (Michael Behe's Darwin's Black Box, for example), this book just isn't one of them."
1,Johnson has an even bigger shovel.,"A must-read for evolutionary biologists: here is every example of slip-shod reasoning, slippery rhetoric, and outrights lies you'll ever need to prepare yourself to defend evolution and the scientific methods."
3,espresso version of All the best,"This is the 4th Tina Turner compilation released by EMI/Capitol and the problem is that it offers nothing extra. We get the same songs all over again. They squeezed the biggest hits of ""All the best"" on one disc. A very disappointing and weak release."
4,Fine collection of an underrated performer,"Johnny Darrell's lot in life, as laid out in the liner notes to this largely great compilation, is one of second-rate also-ran, at least in terms of the business. Yet the passion, soul, and-dare I say it-commerciality evident in the tracks on this disc makes for one hell of a fine listen, especially for fans of 60's country music. This certainly can't be called hardcore honky-tonk;indeed, the steel guitar, if heard at all, is mixed incredibly low in these productions. Rather, these selections bring to mind a higher-timbred Bobby Bare, in voice and production style. Again, if you're a fan of 60's Nashville, you probably shouldn't be without this."
4,Slayers in Space - but so much more,"From the creator of Slayers, Lost Universe has been perhaps unkindly described as ""Slayers in Space"", the tale of bounty hunters for hire who will trek across the galaxy to earn a dollar. While the similarities are easy to draw, it's fair to say that if you enjoy the humour and action of Slayers, and don't mind massive battles in outer-space, you'll probably enjoy Lost Universe. Oh, and like Slayers, the soundtrack rocks too."
2,The dub stinks,"In general Lost Universe is a standard sci-fi anime program. You have a mysterious ship, cute girls, and a guy who wields a sword of light, and attempts a humour which do not smoothly make the transition from stuff that the Japanese may find to be funny verses what most Americans would consider funny. The thing that makes this typical show really stink is the dub. The people that they choose are just horrible. Canal has an annoying voice, Kane is extremely whiny and childless in sound, and Milly sounds like a bubble head. This is clearly not one of A.D. vision's better dubs, so if you must watch this show go for the subtitled version."
1,Slayers Wannabe,"LU really wants to be Slayers. In the spin off the writers are trying really hard for the same chemistry they developed had with slayers, but that fails utterly. Then rather than being funny or clever the charactes just end up being annoying."
5,Lost Universe!,"Lost Universe, a Slayers spin off, is incredibubly funny! The Characters are very funny and well developed right from the start. Between Kane talking about his grandmother and Winign about his cape getting dirty, Milly talking about being the ""Best In The Universe"" and Cannal wining that she's letting idiots run her (She's actual a holographic projection of a human form of the ship, Swordbreaker's computer) you'll be rolling on the floor laughing so heard it will hurt.Many of the voices in the Japanese version are the same as those from Slayers including the all-famous Midorikawa Hikaru! The music is also great from this seriese and it's opening theme, Infinity, is great to listen to even it you don't know Japanese.This is a great Anime, well dubbed int eh English version. the only problem might be if you don't like Animes that have the character's mouths move to the side of their face when they're facing certain ways. If you can get past this though I't very entertaining!"
1,DO NOT BUY DUB,"This is an incredibly great series, so buy the subtitled versions! The dub is extremely pathedic, Kane sounds like a scared little moma's boy, canal's voice actor dribbles through her lines like she has something better to do, and Milly's voice is incredibly annoying! So, my point is... BUY SUBTITLED!"
4,Size is misleading,"In ,ooking at the picture I was expecting it to be bigger and it was not. The knife is beautiful and I like the marble make of the cutting board but I wish it was bigger."
5,Should be viewed by every child,A great way to teach diversity these days. Should be a required teaching instrument. My child loves to watch it on HBO and can't wait to get the video.
5,Amazing,Everyone should see these videos...They are wonderful. I love the perspective that the video take about ability awareness!
5,Awesome video!,"This is a wonderful video about diversity. It is geared toward children and shows a multitude of children with differing abilities and experiences. The video shows children of different races, ages, genders and social classes. A MUST SEE!!"
2,Title doesn't fit movie,"From the title, I thought the stories reflected black children and most of the characters in the movie are white. Finding movies that my black children can identify with is extremely difficult. I'm actually offended and pissed. I returned it. Diversity and tolerance is cool but I wasn't looking for that. I wanted a movie that was entertaining and Black characters were the main characters."
3,Dull Designs,I luckily checked this out of the library to look at before buying. There was nothing I had any interest in making. Perhaps good for a beginner with different tastes. I was glad I did not buy it.
3,"Good, not great","I picked up 'The New Crewel' hoping for some new designs and project ideas. I was a bit disappointed. The information on the history of embroidery is pretty much the highlight of the book. The projects do have a modern look, but you have to manually scan and size the designs. Not so easy to follow. I'm keeping my copy as a reference. However, I'd recommend the 'Embroider Everything Workshop' by Diana Rupp over this particular book."
5,Stylish and informative,"I was really happy with this book. The instructions are clear, the designs are beautiful. I've worked a few of the designs and am looking forward to some free crafting time so I can do more. I love this book!"
3,A couple of nice designs... but overall not worth it.,"There was a few nice patterns in this book, but not much in the way of real instruction.There really wasn't much in this book that can't be found elsewhere.It's one of those books that was put together quickly, and with profit in mind.One good thing though was that stitch diagrams were clear and helpfull. But like I said... all can be found elsewhere."
1,meh.,The patterns were small and overly simplistic. The techniques weren't anything I couldn't get for free from a Google search. I expected a lot more from this book.
2,Really?,"I was looking for ideas for a simple crewel project for the summer and ordered this book sight unseen and I am greatly disappointed. There are some projects but they're nothing I don't think ANYONE could have likely figured out on their own with a stitch dictionary and a little bit of time. There was all of one project idea I might ever do and while it's very simple and beginner friendly the designs are all very similar and well, not to my taste. I'm inclined to say only pick this up if you're new to the craft and would like some fast more modern looking projects to learn on. Anyone with some background in embroidery or who is looking for project art and ideas they wouldn't come up with themselves with a pen and five minutes give this book a miss."
5,Love it!,"Hip, new designs for the modern needle gals. Fun projects, good directions, bright photos. Really helps you think outside the old crewel box for new projects and ideas."
5,Updates an old craft with GREAT new patterns and designs!,"Crewelwork embroidery dates back to the 17th century, but in this updated text it enters the new millennium with style. Author Katherine Shaughnessy shares not only her expertise with the craft - which she has been practicing since age 5 - but also her fresh and innovative designs and approaches to traditional embroidery.You'll find chapters on the history of embroidery, an in-depth discussion of tools and materials, a gallery of 16 stitches, and 30 original designs that came directly from the artist's sketchbook. I love her modern motifs: falling snow, ruby shoots, snowshoes, moon rock, hip squares, puzzle piece, little crown, and more.New stitches lead to new projects: greeting cards, journal covers, framed art, fabric ornaments, pillow covers, embroidered jeans, and much more."
5,"Elegance, Simplicity, Accessibility","I was so excited to see this book from Wool & Hoop's Katherine Shaughnessy. Crewel work has always seemed a little intimidating to me, it looks difficult at first glance. But the illustrations and super-close-up photos in this text demystify the process and make me feel like I could take it on with confidence. This is a gorgeous book full of imaginative designs from an authoritative source!"
5,beautiful...and informative!,"this book is just beautiful, and that's not the best part. her illustrations on how to make the stitches and directions are so incredibly clear. i have too many craft books at home that while have great ideas (and pretty pictures), they have terrible instructions. the new crewel is certainly not one of them. i went out and purchased crewel wool just a day after getting the book for christmas! i can't wait to get started!"
3,beware using this if you're truly a fat-bottom gal....,"I bought this because I have a ""long tailbone problem"" - in regular or cheap flat seat chairs, if I sit too long my tailbone aches. So I shopped for a cushion (like this one) which was well-made and would retain its shape and cushioning(like this one does) and which had a good-size tailbone cutout (like this one does). Problem is, the ""fit"" on this particular cushion is designed for a tiny gal with a tiny bottom - which means for a broad-bottom gal like me, this cushion rolls my hip joints up when I sit on this too-small cushion - and now I've created for myself a hip problem that I've never had before. And I'm not that big (I wear a U.S. size 8 pants), it's just that I have wider hips than the tiny gals that this made-in-china cushion was really designed for...."
1,waste of money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"system crashes, poor customter service, and if you try to reinstall the software it will use up a license, 3 strikes and you cannot use it any more, even on the same machine, as in my case. this is one program for the trash can."
1,System 7 sucks,"I made the mistake of purchasing this piece of junk from Staples. Installed in on my Dell, and quickly lost all internet access. Despite repeated attempts to find solutions, I could not find any. Iolo was of NO help.After searching the internet and finding out that lots of other people had lots of seriious problems with this ""malware"" and could find no help from Iolo, I decided to uninstall it and try returning it to Staples. Staples basically told me, ""Too bad, it's your problem."" Great job of standing behind what you sell, Staples. Great job of creating junk, Iolo.Bottom line--Do NOT buy this or any related Iolo product, and do NOT shop at Staples."
1,I wish I'd never upgraded I feel like I'm stuck in a nightmare,"I was so happy with System Mechanic v.6 that I decided to buy it for my wife. When we went to buy it, v.7 was available and I was excited to see how it could be any better than my v.6.While there I noticed that I could upgrade to v.7 and did so at the same time I bought my wife's copy. Oh, my gosh, what a nightmare we've both had. My computer is trashed, slow, frustrating with problems.I wish I'd never heard of System Mechanic 7."
1,The 7.0.5 and 7.1.5 upgrades are LETHAL...,... and IOLO 'support' lacks the technical ability to understand and solve the problems it creates. Stay away from it. A complete evaluation of the product is posted separately by me here on Amazon.
1,System Mechainic 7 and a Possible Remedy,"What else can I add to these reviews?Just my own story --- and the fix I used to repair damage my PC incurred when I used System Mechanic to try to clean up the registry.System Mechanic left my system unable to connect to the internet either by Wi-Fi or through an Ethernet cable. I spent hours trying to fix it and the Windows System Restore would not work. I envisioned spending the entire weekend restoring files from my backup image plus all file and program updates since that image had been made.There was no tech support, except email, which I could not use because, well --- no internet connection. Fortunately, a Lenovo (I own a ThinkPad) tech support guy suggested I start my PC up in Safe Mode and try to go back to an earlier restore point while *in* Safe Mode. It worked, and I am writing this review on my ThinkPad. But if there were *negative* stars I'd use them (instead of the one star I used) to rate System Mechanic."
1,Does not live up to name.,I've downloaded the trial version of this software. My main goal was to help speed up my computer and at the same time make it more stable. That is what System Mechanic 7 advertises. I've had it on my computer for just 2 weeks of the 30 day trial. The problem happened when my computer told me I had a corrupt file. I ran the SM7 and it found errors and supposedly fixed them. It showed that my computer was in good health and good security. The problem is when I rebooted Windows XP would no longer load up. I tried the recovery disk that they claim could fix the problems. The problem with that is their recovery disk in not a bootable disk. So I had to reinstall Windows XP to get my computer working again.So my advise for anyone looking for a software suite that fixes problems is to keep looking. This one is not worth the money if it can't keep your computer from crashing.
1,Don't buy this........,"After a very smooth installation of SM 7 I found that I could no longer connect to my LAN which had previously connected fine. This occurred on both lapptops running XP Pro SP2. You will also have to reenter many of your previously saved online ID's, usernames, and passwords. I spent hours trying to correct the connection problems, finally giving up and unstalling SM 7. Two restarts later put my machines back to normal with connections to my BFFALO access point restored. I too, gave carte blanch permission for SM 7 to repair all problems. Just hope those repairs don't jump up & bite my a.. later on."
5,Fine balls,I'm not such an expert that I can really complain about these or really praise them. They are baseballs for little league (T-Ball). They do the trick.
5,A wonderful and feelgood concert!,"I totally enjoyed the concert, the locations, the presentation, and the way the talent was showcased. John is unselfish about ""allowing"" the other musicians to be spotlighted, and as well as thoroughly enjoying the orchestral participants, I enjoyed all the others as well. The young Irish dancers were splendid! Robert Mirabel is a master of his genre, and the sequence on the mountaintop was most enjoyable. I became an instant fan of the incredibly talented Lorenza Ponce, and have purchased both her CDs. The sound quality is glorious - all in all, worth having in any DVD/sound library unless you just don't like music that sounds and FEELS good!"
5,Fantastic Experience,"My life has not been the same since I first saw this performance on PBS. I taped it off-air; then when it came out on VHS I bought ten copies to give to friends. The DVD makes it more beautiful to see and hear and easier to find specific sections.About a year after I first saw it I had a chance to meet the violinist, Lorenza Ponce, who, in my opinion, is the centerpiece of the whole production. Her playing of the violin, her singing and her presence are absolutely incredible. She is a wonderful person to talk to and has her own web site and has made a number of CD's."
3,Could Have Been More Enjoyable...,"had it been more performance oriented, as John Tesh claims it to be. Instead all we have here are travel music videos in the MTV tradition of lip-syncing and other audio tricks. One would have expected more of a serious approach to a serious topic, instead we have grown-ups pretending to be playing when they really aren't. And when we do hear them at the end of one song, they sound really bad.I got mine used so I don't feel so bad, but I wouldn't recommend this if your looking for real musicmanship.What's good about this DVD? Excellent picture, sound, great visuals. If that's all you want, then you'll be happy."
2,THIS IS A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE LISTENING EXPERIENCE,"I like Kenny Barron, and I really wanted to like this CD. I don't like this CD. It truly is an uncomfortable listening experience. The problem seems to be that the compositions are trying very hard to be interesting and they don't flow well. They are bebop tunes disguised as progressive jazz. If you listen enough to it you can hear the tunes reaching to be something that they never achieve. The players are great, but I really turn off to the two cuts with Regina Carter. Violin is something to me that doesn't fit in this context. It's like putting an accordian in the mix of Bitches Brew. It just doesn't go, you know? Also the tunes, and I call them tunes, have no relation to each other. All types of different styles. This is jazz that is very easy to follow, but really something to stay away from. This is really poorly written material. I'm trying to be nice."
2,A major disappointment,"What went wrong here? The musicians are excellent: Russell Malone, Billy Hart, and Barron himself. But it's all so derivative and dull. At times, the group wants to sound like Horace Silver. And then it's Ellington. And then it's Miles. Ultimately, nothing comes off. As for jazz violin, well, it's almost bearable. A bummer."
3,German melodic metal,"Christian, German melodic metal, the band had an ep'The Sign of Victory `then signed to Pure Metal around 1990.First off nothing really caches your ear here and that is not good for a melodic band, but the music is not bad at all.The vocals can get flat in places.Second, there are two or three good songs here, and compared to some of the bands Pure Metal was putting out (Pure Metal had a habit of signing bands that were just not ready to record an album and it showed) this one was ok.Third, it can be hard to find this cd. This disc may be worth having especially to the collector of 80's metal or early White Metal.I only give them a third star for track 10 IN THE DARK, because I like German speed metal, this song is close to it."
1,Dvd Wall Storage,"We ordered and received our dvd shelf and was completely shocked when we discovered it to be particle board and cardboard. The original price for this p.o.s. was somewhere around 900 dollars, before it went on some kind of so called sale for around 250 dollars. With that being said we never even thought twice that this shelf was going to be something other than real wood. My opinion is that this shelf should have been priced around 120 to 160 dollars. We also came to find out that it doesn't even hold 702 dvd's as claimed. If someone is looking for a good dvd shelf I would suggest that you search a little harder before buying this p.o.s. that won't even survive a move. We received a 10% rebate for our disbelief, what a !#@$ing joke!"
1,"A REAL PIECE OF JUNK,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!","EXTRMELY POORY DESIGNED AND ENGINEERED PRODUCT AND A REAL PIECE OF JUNK.YOU WILL BE EXTREMELY LUCKY IF IT LASTS 1-2-3 WEEKS BEFORE SOMETHING CHIPS,BREAKS OR CRACKS ON IT.ITS MADE OF SOMETHING LIKE COMPRESSED PAPER MACHET THAT SPLITS,BREAKS & CHIPS VERY EASILY(and the unit held together by cheap plastic dowels that bend abd break and fail as well).THE SLIGHTEST BUMP INTO ANYTHING WHILE YOUR MOVING IT AND IT WILL BREAK,CHIP,CRACK,ETC..I THINK THIS UNIT IS PROBABLY IN LINE WITH THE SAME KIND OF CHEAP JUNK FOUND AT KMART,WALLMART,TARGET,ETC(STUFF THAT IS ""NOT"" DESIGNED TO LAST AND OR IS ""INTENTIONALLY"" DESIGNED TO FAIL)."
5,Perfect,"If you are looking for a DVD/VHS high volume storage piece of furniture, this is it. The cardboard backing was not very exicting to see, but it serves its purpose well."
5,Good book for Introduction to Finances,"In my opinion, it's an excellent book for the subject. The material is very well structured. I would like more math but, probably, authors deliberately avoided to be too technical."
5,Cheaper than college bookstores,"Got a good price on the book, and received the product within a few days. Very happy with the purchase. Had to learn everything from the book because the teacher didn't know how to teach!"
5,BEST BOOK FOR Corporate Finance!!!,It's really very interesting and useful book for corporate finance and you can find many good and usful things in this book!
5,Arrives as shown in picture,Brooch is very pretty with a vintage look. Picture give good depiction of what brooch will look like.

3,Knowlegable Author's Encyclopedia of Orchids,The author is one of the most knowledgeable people in the orchid world. he has written and accumulated photos of a reasonable chunk of orchids in cultivation with a mix of some rarities. The text is not for a beginner. Similaarely it won't help much with cultivation problems. A good reference with high quality photos. He avoids jumping into the crazed world of nomenclature of being rewritten with every passing day. Matt CohenZen of Watering Your Garden
2,"Boring, meaningless and cheap","This isn't really an encyclopaedia. Rather, it's a meaningless coffee table book. True, 1100 orchid species are illustrated and identified, but so what? The presentations are extremely short, so short that Wikipedia would consider them stubs, and the photos are plain boring. Usually, we only get a close up of one particular flower! Nor are common names included, not even of species which have established English names (such as the Lady's Slipper orchid). If you own a barbershop or run a health clinic, this book may be good for the waiting room, but to actually *read* it is pointless. Instead, try to find books about a specific geographical region, or a specific group of orchids. ""The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Orchids"" will just annoy you and make you $30 poorer."
5,this book is full of information.,this book is loaded with bass knowledge chapter afer chapter.they make it easy to understand.i've been fishing for years but was learning from the 1st chapter.
5,Great diversity,"The Beautiful Girls are one of my favorite bands ever. This new release from them adds another dimension to their limited yet incredible music library. Any comparisons to Jack Johnson, who I also enjoy, should be tossed out the window after this release. TBG embarks on a more musically diverse and lyrically dark journey with ""We're Already Gone"". You will hear much more of the reggae and dub influence. The band jams a bit more and their new harmonica player adds a dimension. You'll get some of the classic acoustic stuff on this as well, but you will be treated to a heavier, more electric sound but with the same groove roots vibe to all of it. Took me a bit to get used to, but feel this is a great record. Buy it!"
4,instant pick me up.... this CD is a must have,"i got this cd after i had ""learn yourself"" for about a year and i love it ten times more. this cd is not really that alike to their first album and i would reccomend buying this one first if you have never heard them because it kind of touches ground on their different talents within the group moreso than learn yourself which is mainly acoustic."
1,Farberware Urn,Our Church purchesed 2 Urns. They were used about 5 times and one burned out. It does not heat up or perk the coffee anymore.We were very disappointed as they were purchased in March of 2004.
4,Don't use a filter,"This pot works and looks as advertised, however the first time I used it, there were some grounds in the coffee. So I put a coffee filter in the bottom of the basket next time, but then it wouldn't drain at all while perking and the basket overflowed with all the grounds going into the mix - big mess. The next time I used a high-end coffee that had been ground quite fine. The basket again clogged and wouldn't drain when perking, even with no filter, with grounds overflowing into mix - another big mess. So don't use a filter or a fine-grind and it should work. The included manual should point that out."
5,Good Long lasting coffee,I have had this urn for awhile now. Brews a good pot of coffee that stays hot for a long time without burning.
1,Disappointing Results,"For the price, this urn has very few features. Sure it's stylish but has no on/off switch, automatice shut off or indicataor for water level. It cannot be left unattended or the pot will eventually run dry and burn up, which is what happened to us."
5,Excelente Producto,"Excelente producto, En lo personal, uno de los mejores DVD que he visto y escuchado. Uno de los mejores cantantes del mundo. Si pudiera colocara 100 estrellas. 100% recomendado tanto el vendedor como el producto."
4,Mixed Feelings,"I first discovered Josh Groban when he made two appearances on Ally McBeal and have been a huge fan ever since. I was somewhat disappointed in this DVD. By mid-way through the DVD, I had to turn it off because my ears hurt. It just seemed like Josh was screaming through so many of the songs. Maybe it was just a poor sound mix."
4,I have seen better ones!,"I give this Blu-ray four-star rating for a dissapointing styling of Josh Groban. I have the DVD title ""In Concert"" a live in Pasadena California. That one, I think, rightfully deserves a five-star rating. Comparing to it, this one has to fall down to four! Somehow, maybe it is my personal bias, this one packaged Josh Groban wrong although it was a good-hearted try. Josh gives me the image of a good neighborhood boy, going to church every Sunday and singing gospel and patriotic songs. His hair should be nicely cut and trimmed, dressing style should be conservative. But, in this production, Josh was different! His hair was messy and his dress was sloppy. It is like David Foster producing a song. He tirelessly looks for the right voice and style to match the singing of it. Once that song is produced, it becomes minted to our heart. I like to listen to music with my heart and imagination. This new styling of Josh Groban is hard to digest."
3,A gift with good intentions,"I gave this CD to my husband, a huge Josh Groban fan. Though greatly appreciative, he did not find this CD up to the standards of others he owns. He only listens to one or two tracks."
3,Blu-ray or Standard?,"Once again, Josh does a wonderful job performing all the songs on this dvd and goes the extra step to make the audience feel as part of the concert. The video quality is excellent as is that of the audio section, but the mixing of the audio channels was poorly done. Even though there is audio heard from the 5.1 channels, it is realy more like a 2.1 recording, thus eliminating the need to purchase the Blu-ray version. Nevertheless, the Concert will be a very nice addition to anyone's video/audio library and more so a Josh Groban fan."
5,Awake for every moment,"The last song on the DVD,Awake, is my favorite Josh song of all time, and it always makes me feel warm, cozy and a bit sad to think about the passage of time, and loved ones. This DVD (and the concert tour) is Josh Groban at his best, with his concerns for children, especially African children, at the forefront, and his musicality (musical genius I would say) touching hearts everywhere. Josh is the international artist, a voice for everyone. If you don't know Josh Groban's music, you might want to sample a bit, because I think there is something for everyone, from almost operatic Italian pop to electronica to sweeping ballads. My life changed the first time I heard Josh sing over five years ago and I will happily never be the same."
5,Incredible awesome performance,A Josh Groban concert is an incredible experience. With this dvd you get to experience that. His voice transcends all genres and the musicians on this dvd are superlative!
5,Josh's biggest fan,"I attended Josh's ""Awake"" concert in Philadelphia and the DVD was almost as good as being there. I have enjoyed his music since the first time I heard him on a David Foster's special. Next to Barbra Streisand, he is my all time favorite singer."
5,Still making fabulous music!,Josh Groban fans won't be disappointed with this newest release. There are some wonderful new songs - all performed in Groban's incredible voice and style.Enjoy!!
3,Awake Live CD/DVD,"I enjoyed it, but didn't ""love"" it. I thought I'd hear Josh Groban from years ago when he sounded better.It was just Okay! The noise level of background was too high. I know it was ""Live"" but this was too loud."
2,Defective CD,"This Josh Grogan CD was a 2 CD package. The first CD was really good. The 2nd CD was defective and did not play. Amazon sent a replacement but thatone was defective also. Amazon refunded my money as soon as I returned the CD's. Amazon is a great company to do business with, they have a first class operation and treat their customers right."
2,Disappointing,"Read great reviews on this, however, the majority of songs are not in English. Even if I was biligual, it sounds as though he is singing in at least 4 different languages. While I don't object to songs in different languages, I prefer not to have almost an entire CD of songs I can't understand other than the melody. Probably will not play it very often, or maybe I will give it to someone who wants it."
3,Josh Groban Just a Nice Person,"I must tell you that Working for The Philadelphia Spectrum for many years we had Josh Groban Last year at our Wachovia Center for the first time and I was so pleased that he was so nice backstage to everyone something that many performrs are not.Just for that reason and a great voice to boot get this dvd.One Thing I must say is that I think Blu Ray discs were suppose to be so much more than regular dvd,s but as prices fall I find that the companies are skimping on the material that Blu Ray can Hold which is in excess of 7 times what a regular dvd can...Get with the program Motion Picture Companies Blu Ray is special lets keep it that way"
3,This Concert does not deserve Blu-ray,"I rated CD/DVD version 1 star because I thought it's just another Live at the Greek, I just hope this Blu-ray version could add some video surprise to the boring concertIf must turn to Blu-ray, I will choose Josh's in Concert, it's millions times better than Awake live and Live at the Greek, but I thought it's just no chance"
2,Stock photos are deceiving. A low quality jacket. :(,"I was impressed by the price of this jacket and when it arrived, I was a little taken aback at how thin and cheap it looked. I DID love the strong real leather smell it put off, however. As I wore it, I realized that it was quite warm, even though it was VERY VERY thin leather, and not at all like the photos shows making this jacket appear quite thick.So, I decided to be positive, however, after 1 1/2 weeks of wear, I noticed thinning at the elbow areas. Also, I saw a small area of stitch release in the middle of the arm, where there is really never any tension.A day after that, this area became a 2 inch hole...OMG! I was very let down, and I would have liked a refund...as leather should last and last and last. This is a usual case of ""you get what you pay for"" in my opinion. I'm not happy with this product's quality at all."
1,Plastic,It's like a very thick garbage bag. I will spend $200 to get a real leather jacket and not waist $27 for this.
2,89A Black Leather Jacket,"This is supposed to be a purchased Christmas Gift. I does have an oder to it. We have it hanging out to see if the oder goes away. The jacket looks ""nice"". I am sure the recipient would like it, but I can't give it for a gift if it ""STINKS"". So we will have to see what developes here."
1,not great,"i am a big fan of many graphic artists and comic books, but i was disappointed by this one, and not surprised that it started in a no-longer-with-us fashion magazine. the work is very dated...focused on that corny 1980's to mid 1990's non-idea that ""feminists can be sexy and feminine!"" (duh - of course they can. they can be whatever they want to be!) the whole thing really just seems to moan about men and obsess about fashion...snarky, unpleasant, self obsessed, and very middle class, somewhat reminiscent of pulpy writers like tama janowitz. the drawings are perfunctory, not inspiring like ""love and rockets"" or julie doucet. but i suppose if you own all of ""sex and the city"" on dvd you might find it amusing."
5,More than Awesome,"Of all the concerts I could have gone to but didn't, this one ranks in the top 3 of those I wish I'd gotten off my duff to experience.UA is at peak form, the her sound and backing is better live than on her studio albums.While her 4 (5?) English-language covers are somewhat hobbled by her awkward intonation limitations, UA's voice itself proves worthy of comparison to Grace Slick and Patti Smith.Her 10 originals on this album slot together beautifully and make this a most impressive work."
2,Ok for as far as it goes.,"This book does not fully, or clearly, and or concisely explain. It simply explains the process of court child custody litigation. It very simplisticly shows how custody decisions are made. It doesn't really explain what can be expected.These guys don't personally understand why there is so much anger and pain and suggest we should easily move on.This book is self-serving for attorneys, evaluators, family psychologists, and marriage and family therapists.If you are buying everything, go ahead and buy this one."
1,Another waste of paper,"Bought this one too. See my last review for ""Custody for fathers"". Save the money you would have spent on this book and buy your child something special or make a payment to a good lawyer."
2,From the horses mouth.,"You can find some help-full suggestions in this self-serving book by a California judge, with contributions from a custody evaluator. But, you will have to look hard for something new and there are much better books listed on Amazon."
1,they tried their best: but the performance is poor,"These Bach ""small masses"" are masterpieces, but the present recording is not very good. Have the performers not listened to an Eterna edition vinyl recording from DDR? These masses should really sing, like Domine Deus (track 9).I am now rewriting this review. Anybody who gives this recording a high rating has little idea about how Bach should sound. Yes, there is plenty of snobs, who want to sound educated by writing ""educated"" review. The fact is: this performance is poor, no matter how many snobs give it 5 stars.Rewriting again, because I cannot believe that people have so little taste for Bach: guys, do yourself a favor, buy JS Bach Masses BWV 233-236, Berlin Classics label, available from Amazon, listen to it, then listen to this CD. If then you cannot hear the difference, go to the doctor."
4,"Loud Rocks, does just that.","I got this CD when it first came out a few years ago, it was actually a fluke that I got it. I thought some of the songs seemed like they would be great, and I found out that they did. I am NOT disappointed with this cd, and I will never be.Every single track on this cd impresses me, and the rap/rock fusion is a sound that needs to be repeated.BUY THIS CD"
2,"I've only heard parts of the cd, but it's enough","For all of those people interested in rap and hip-hop this is the album for you, but for all the others I'd say stay away. I only looked into it because I'm a huge incubus fan and want to hear all the stuff they have done, but this album is yucky. Brandon sings on one of the tracks and oh yes, he sounds all nice and Brandon like, but then the rest of the entire song is rap. I just am trying to warn those ""rock"" fans out there who may be thinking about this album that umm... it's not in anyway toward the rock genre from the parts I heard. And all those incubus fans like me, just stick to buying their own rare imports, singles, and old vinyl of demos if you want hard to come by good incubus music. But go hip-hop!"
3,A Great novelty purchase,"SOAD'S Wu Tang cover is great. Tracks 2/ 5/ 9 and 11 are good and the rest are pretty bad.This is a great album to get as a gift, or for under ($) otherwise its not worth it. If you are a hip hop head you will get frustrated at times because of all the girlish singing provided by Sugar RAY, Incubus et al and if you are a Rock fan then all the rapping will put you off but there is more rock than rap."
4,Excellent 80's Rock,"The Fixx's second album is also their best. Catchy rhythms, great guitar play, and seductive atmospheres to boot. Hits galore on ths disc, ""Saved By Zero,"" ""One Thing...,"" ""Outside,"" etc. This is one of the 80's best. Give it a listen."
4,The Fixx-Reach the Beach-CD,"I liked Shuttered Room better but this one is my second favorite CD of The Fixx. If you like The Fixx, you'll most likely like this CD."
5,18 years of Awesome music,"I've been listening to this group for 18 years, every album (cd) they have produced is top-notch! including Reach The Beach. There is not a song on this cd that doesn't still send a chill up my spine or get me excited even after 18 years. ""Outside"" features Cy Curnin's lyrics that pry open your soul, and Jamie West-Oram's unique style in a guitar solo that reaches ""Inside"" and stirs every emotion. All of the songs on this cd can be interpreted in more ways than one. Critics will be critics and don't know there ear from their elbow when it comes to music. This cd and every cd they have made before and since are worth every penny! Don't forget to see them in concert, if you like the music on the cd's their live performance is 10 times better."
5,FIXX -Reach Tbe Beach,"This was the first FIXX album that I ever bought back in grade school. I loved it then, and I still absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!!!! They are my favorite band of all time! They are also an absolute MUST SEE in concert if you have the opportunity! I saw them as a kid at the AZ Sate Fair and I couldn't believe how great they were! I was there with my ""stoner"" friends who liked metal. They didn't want to stay for the show because it wasn't their kind of music. So, I ditched them and watched myself. I think that I was around 12 or 13 years old going solo! I also saw them a few years back in San Diego and it was seriously the best concert that I have been to in at least 20 years. Perfect resurrection band!!!!! You will be sorry if you don't see them at least once in your life!!!!!!"
3,A respectable album.,"I have to hand it to The Fixx--they are a unique band. I like the atmospheric quality to their music. Reach the Beach is a decent album from them. It's pop rock with a progressive touch. There's a total of ten tracks. The musicianship, songwriting, and production are tight. I like how they combine the keyboard and guitar playing (There's a nice amount of both.). Cy Curnin does well with the vocals. I've never heard another vocalist that even resembles him. The songs that I like the most are ""Saved by Zero,"" ""Opinions,"" ""Reach the Beach,"" and ""Outside."" ""Saved by Zero"" is one of my definitive favorites from The Fixx. Cy Curnin's vocals are memorable, and Rupert Greenall's keyboard playing is atmospheric. ""Opinions"" is also a nice ballad. Jamie West-Oram's guitar playing on ""Outside"" is cool, too. There's some catchy stuff on this album. Worth a listen."
4,"A high point for the 1980's nascent ""alternative rock"" sound","There are classic 80's albums that do not age at all...like ""London Calling"" or ""Purple Rain"". They would have been great in any era.Then you have albums like ""Reach The Beach"", which is an example of the best "" 80's music"" . It has all the hallmarks of that era's sound...the nervy, plucky guitars; the dry drum sound, the bouncy synth chords or that keyboard ""wash"" of sound acting as background wall paper.I probably haven't listened to this album all the way through in over fifteen years, yet I found myself immediately recalling every lyric, guitar lick or synth punctuation. With ease.I remember loving the record upon it's release; it has some killer singles on it. Namely ""One Thing Leads to Another"" and ""Saved By Zero"" but the album cuts are fairly strong as well. I love it still, and appreciate it more.An excellent choice for remastering, which has been immaculately done."
3,Some Good Stuff's On Here.,"I have the tape to this release. There's some stuff on here that I'm not too attached to, but there are also songs like ""Saved By Zero,"" ""Opinions,"" and ""Reach the Beach,"" which I think are great songs. You can't go completely wrong with any individual album by The Fixx. Every album by them has something to offer. Worth a listen."
3,"Good rock rhythm, up beat, mysterious...","This album put The Fixx on the charts. The first five songs (side A for you vinyl people) are good, with ""One Thing Leads To Another"", ""The Sign Of Fire"", and ""Saved By Zero"" being the best."
3,Great Music But The Re-master Has Too Much Sizzle!,"Great band, terrific album. I really like the alternate (and longer) versions of Saved By Zero and One Thing Leads To Another. They are a treat.What isn't a treat is the high-end sizzle on this remastering. The bass and mids sound better than they ever did on my turntable, but the highs are way too hot. They remind me of the shrill sounding CDs of 30 years ago. I was expecting a 2003 remaster to be smoother.If you don't have treble control on your amp or a decent EQ, try to find another version of this great album."
3,Product Good Quality; Misrepresented in Picture!,"The product received was very good quality, and I was pleased. That said, the picture shows two (2) mitts and only one (1) mitt was received. No where in the description does it delineate how many mitts are included, but I assumed two based on the picture. Also, the mitt does not look like the picture. Shipping took full 10 days to receive (Amazon normal is three)."
3,SOSO,I was a little disappointed when I first received the mitts as they are not the ones pictured. However the company was wonderful in further assisting me with correcting and compensating me. I would deffinatly purchase from this company again.
5,Love it!!,"I use this in my elementary general music classes, but there is enough musical content to carry this into middle school. This piece is a great way to incorporate instrument identification, motif, jazz idioms and so much more. Bravo!!!"
2,Break in less than two months,"I put the heater on the carpet and one day I accidentally hit it. It only fell to the carpet. The fan detached and you can't fix it as they say there is no user serviceable parts inside. Because it is over 30 days, I have to pay $11 to have it repaired or replaced + cost of sending it back. Better buy a heater at a nearby Target or Sears where you can return defective item easily. This heater is noisy too."
1,Not very hot,"This just does not work well. Does not put out much heat and VERY loud. I bought it to put under my desk as a replacement for an older one that broke. This just doesn't put out much heat at all, and is so loud that I need to turn it off to take phone calls. I now have to look for a better one. Very disappointed."
2,look for something else,"Heater works, but well below my expectations. Better go to home depot or similar store (don't try walmart, they're cheap made too, and the more expensive models surpass the price you would find in stores like sears, check it to believe it)"
1,DMX ABUSES ANIMALS,"Don't buy anything by this creep, he has been busted for abusing animals twice. Def Jam needs to stop glorifying animal cruelty on his album covers."
3,"oh, what could have been...","These songs were not picked by dmx, this collection was put together in 07, way after x had parted ways with def jam. I don't think that DMX would have waisted valuable disc room for two prayer songs when they could have included actual music material. why a greatest hits album would ever include skits is beyond me. that is the main beef i have with this collection, aslo the fact that the jacket does not include which album each song came off of like most ever greatest hits albums. The main song I thought would have added to the album is the track ""Damien""from his first LP."
5,The Yonkers New York Rapper,"I have been a true DMX fan, since 1997. In his rhymes you can hear his hurt deep within. My personal favorite song is slippin in my darkness hours of life, that song saved me emotionally. I also love his cockiness, in the song What the B-----'s want, and F--- all day. I enjoy all the songs selected on this disc.His songs are not negative, they are about him releasing his rage, in his journey in life. If people are not familar with the streets, then they would think his music is offensive, or if those who never had struggle, and don't understand street lifestyle, would be threatened by the content in his music.NO matter what, the media says about you, I appreciate your artistic style, and rhyme skills. If you are fan of DMX then get this CD."
3,"Where is ""Get It On The Floor"" from Grand Champ?","The sole reason why I didn't purchase this album is because ""Get It On The Floor"" was not included. I was at Best Buy with Pick of the Litter in my hand when I slowly came to this awful realization as I scanned the track list on the back--I reluctantly put it back on the shelf. DMX is one of the best-selling rappers of all time, born with a golden, milllion-dollar voice other artists would kill for. Pick of the Litter should've been one of the best albums in the history of hip hop; instead, it's like purchasing Jay-Z's greatest hits without ""99 Problems,"" Tupac's without ""California Love,"" or Nas's without ""Made You Look."""
2,Spanish student perspective..,"My honors Spanish 5 class watched this. We couldn't even understand everything so who can beginner learners understand?Anyways, not to be a cynic, but my honest opinion is that it was very boring and a waste of time. Pretty much the whole class was laughing at the cheesy, overly-done acting. Not entertaining or enjoyable learning at all. If the reason anyone is looking this movie up, if you're interested in practicing listening skills, then watch a CURRENT Spanish soap opera from cable(acting is slightly better), Spanish music, or some Spanish Disney channels. There you can learn everyday lingo and not feel like banging your head against a wall. Heck, even try the website Livemocha where you can actually learn and chit chat from cool native speakers around your age. Anything besides this..in my personal opinion."
2,Used doesn't mean Worn,"The book was listed as used, but it was completely worn, and the cover was ripped, and the entire book was written in. The book should have been listed as Poor."
3,Adorable,"This is an adorable jar that we have in our living room. Great product, good build, durable. I would purchase this item or a similar product."
5,greg's cd rocks everyone's toe socks!,"1,000 words. hmm...i'll make this snappy. after hearing ""worthless"" and ""take me back home"" which by the way were utterly amazing...i had to buy his cd. i got it. and listened to it. i was blown away. not only were his songs amazing, he's still got the voice of an angel. he's truly amazing at what he does and deserves full support from all his fans...and everyone who's not his fan. buy his cd because it's more than worth it. i can't describe to you how amazing it is. i think the best songs are ""take me back home"", ""worthless"", ""she's leaving"", ""we're in love"" and ""my life."" but they're all awesome. kthnx. i'm done."
4,Greg Raposo ROCKS!!,"i LOVE this CD i listen it all the time, its addicting lol, Greg's voice is amazing! ""take me back home"" is definitely one of my favorite songs on the album, ""worthless"" is off the hook, i love the acoustic guitar in the beginning and the lyrics are soo good! However there are songs on the album that...im not so fond of, ""In My Eyes"" is one of them, Greg's voice sounds somewhat nazely, but overall the cd is a tremendous success, awesome!"
5,gregs cd,"You might be thinking ""isnt that the kid from dreamstreet?"" well yah it is but he isnt a kid anymore. hes grown up so much and matured over the last couple of years. i love this cd so much. i have absolutley no regrets with buying it and im sure you wouldnt either. i listen to it all the time. i give it 5 stars and i would give a million stars if i could. in his cd greg shows his true, romantic, passionate and fun loving side that he could never show in dreamstreet. i am positive that greg will go the furthest of the dreamstreet members."
5,Greg Raposo rocks our world!!!,"Greg's cd was unbelievable!!!! All of his songs are fun to listen to and its even more incredible that he wrote some of them. Even if you don't like Dreamstreet, this is a different form of music and I suggets you try it out! wE luv u Greg!!!"
5,Great music for all,"From the first song to the last, this CD rocks! It doesn't matter if you are new to greg's music or have listened to him since he was wowing crowds in DreamStreet, this music will satisfy. From rock to slow music lovers, you need to hear this music!!!!!!!"
5,IT'S A KICK BUTT CD!,"Greg, has major talent along with meaningful lyrics. He put his Heart & Soul into Creating this CD for all of his Fans. Greg, If u read this the DS Friends love you lots! Keep kicking BUTT!"
1,FULL SCREEN ONLY?!? Another DVD Ruined.,"I'll not get into the merits of ""Metalstorm"" as a movie. Needless to say, I like for what it is: Low-budget filmmaker Charles Band's attempt at a ""Star Wars"" clone...but without the ""stars"" or the ""wars"".But this DVD is a different story. ""Metalstorm"" was originally released in 3D at a screen aspect of 2.35:1. I can accept this DVD not being 3D. What I cannot accept is Universal's decision to release it in 4x3 full screen format only. 5 years ago, there may have been some flawed logic to releasing it in full screen. After all, TV signals were still SD and HD-TVs were only beginning to become mainstream. But, in 2010, there is no excuse. Universal has killed this DVD. And, since any hope at an eventual re-issue would likely be tied to this DVD's sales, Universal has likely killed all chances at any widescreen release of ""Metalstorm."" :("
3,classic right up there with mad max,"I know this movie isn't of the highest quality and certainly not worth the asking price, but it is a good b movie."
2,"Great, except cost.",Black jelly beans are compelling. In a moment of anticipation I ordered 2 units (4 lbs.). They arrived promptly and were totally delicious. Then I did the math. $12.50 plus $7.50 shipping comes to $5.00/lb. Good - but THAT good? You decide.
4,Black Jelly Beans,"I purchased Black Jelly Beans for a shipment overseas to Portugal. It seems they have a problem getting Jelly Beans. Not because they caint, but because they are just so darn expensive, enter Amazon! It was very reasonable for the amount you got and the delivery was very quick, like 2 days later. Unfortunitly I could not get the deliver to this address to accept my addy, so the US postal service came to the rescue with their ""If it fits it ships"" slogan....lol. Anyway I recommend the Beans they where great I am told by my friend in Portugal."
4,It helps me remember why I thought Clinton was a bad president too,"Bovard is always a little dry, but this one shows his humor here and there. There isn't quite as much in the way of over-arching analysis, but his breakdown by general topics is enlightening. I particularly liked his coverage of Reno and Freeh and the mess they caused. Also, I was unaware of AmeriCorps (which is pertinent today as it rears its head again) and such similar wastes of money. My main complaint is that while the coverage on the Kosovo situation was great, there were a great many other similar examples that could've been included.This one isn't quite a dry as many of his others. It reads a little better as result. It doesn't tend to have the list of specific incidences that ""lost rights"" had, and that's pretty much a good thing. This books is a great rebuttal to those who still don't get why Clinton did a poor job while he was here, not just his policies that would guarantee economic faltering later."
1,Same Old stuff,"There's very little new here and a lot of it is quite similar to Bovard's older books. I do agree with his comments about the drug war, and asset forfeiture. On the other hand, a large part of the reason for Clinton coming to power was that he co-opted conservative positions such as toughness on crime, drugs and activist foreign policy from Republicans. [ After Bush attacked and won against Dukakis for being soft on crime and pro-ACLU]Oh, and while I thought that Waco was a disasterous mistake from Day one by the BATF and the Feds, its not true that the BATF could have arrested Koresh at any time away from the compound. They could not have arrested him without a arrest warrant, and they could not have got an arrest warrant without a search, for which the search warrant was required. The way in which they served it was screwed up, of course."
4,very good,"Very good anime, all about luck and the diffrence between making your own luck and having it made for you. The captian keeps getting into stranger and stranger situations, yet somehow comes out on top. Very funny, and as always there are elements of seriousness throughout the series."
5,trust your inner vampire and read this book,"This is a clever, witty smart novel that was ahead of it's time! the characters are well developed and intriguing. I found myself very involved with the depth of the vampire characters. I found this vampire story to be much more interesting than the Twilight vampire books. I think the author has underrated himself and will hopefully re-release this book. His historical research adds to the dark , moody, cynical development of the vampires. I am looking forward to more from Mr. Muffoletto."
3,no... not really,"the people below are saying that this EP is worth it just for 'Konstantine', which is their opinion, but still, Konstantine isn't perfect. It's alright, but overlong and uninteresting in part of it. I like SoCo, but still I think Konstantine is not worth 28 bucks for anyone except hardcore fans (inevitably someone's going to come after me trying to say that Konstantine is perfect... don't believe them). The rest of the EP rehashes some of LTTW. My favorite track is the live performance of Straw Dog. Forget December is also pretty good but not great."
5,worth it for one song...,"again, stressing the point almost every other person has made, this cd is worth every penny just for one song... yes, knostantine. if you have even head of something corporate, you NEED to hear konstantine. it's possibly the most perfect song i've ever heard (though extremely long). though most of the other songs (with the exception of forget december) are available on other cd's, it's worth what it cost."
1,"Ma'am, don't quit your day job.","I'm an avid reader of many genres, and am always more than willing to give new authors a fair shot. Unfortunately for me, I decided to give Erin Hart's first novel, Haunted Ground, the proverbial college try on one rainy afternoon.I found the book's pacing to be sluggish, and its dialogue rich with typical Irish cliche. My overall impression was that Hart is a maniacal American obsessed with the Emerald Isle, but doesn't know the culture well enough to write a plausible story without going overboard. In short, she tried much too hard.And, concerning my own personal experience with the novel, I tried much too hard... to finish the book. Despite my efforts, I was forced to put this piece back on the shelf after only 5 chapters."
4,Found: one head. Missing: one body,"Lovely beginning. These two poor sods find a head, just a head, in a peat bog in the Irish countryside. Haunted Ground has the usual small village mix of eccentric characters, gothic suspence, and the creepiness of the best murder mysteries. There're the village folk, and then there are the gentry in the proverbial 'big house.'Terrific debut mystery with enough background history and character development to start a whole series."
3,Not a strong beginning...,"Hart offers an interesting start to her mystery series featuring Nora Gavin, an American in Ireland. The Irish setting adds a lot to not only the plot, but the atmosphere and characters. This more of a lush mystery than a thrilling one - it is surprisingly easy to pause in this mystery and pick up again where you left off. And despite the strength of Hart's writing, and the interesting topic, the book lacked that quality to set it above and beyond. The romantic sidestory fell completely flat and felt forced to me, and the book just did not meet my expectations for it. However, series books are not always consistent, so I think I will give Hart another chance, and see if the sequel in the series is any stronger than this first novel."
2,Characters had no depth,"I was pretty disappointed. The story line had potential to be captivating, but the characters were flat. This book definitely didn't draw me in. And the use of foul language didn't add anything to the dialog. I was glad I bought a used copy and got a discount."
1,A trick,"This book is not about a bog-woman mystery.All people's talk talk talk, it seems to be about another missing person mystery.It hasn't been about the bog-woman since the 1st few chapters.s"
2,this isn't one of them....,"There are plenty of good mystery stories set in the British Isles. Haunted Ground isn't one of them. The plot is transparent, easy to figure out after only 50 pages or so, and so are the few relationships that Hart attempts to develop. The rest is just window dressing. It puzzles me how so many reviewers have found this novel full of Celtic lore and history. I didn't notice much of either."
2,Too Much Head-Hopping,"I was prepared to like this book, especially after the rave reviews found here on Amazon, and Audible. But I found that Haunted Ground: A novel, quickly lost my interest. Why, you may ask? Because the author has too many characters and she head-hops between them constantly. Each section is narrated by a new character, and frankly I lost interest. I prefer books with one, possibly two voices but not a half dozen. This is particularly disconcerting in audio format. Plus, I found the drippy American character with the tortured past and murdered sister a bit trite and maudlin.Feh, overall, 2 stars. If she had stuck to a single or maybe dual perspective it might've captured my interest."
3,Over-written,"Sorry. I read a lot of mysteries but after the first hundred pages of this one, I had to give up. It felt like the author was just trying TOO hard to make these characters come to life, and they wouldn't cooperate. Instead of telling a story, she spent too much time creating the setting and trying to give us psychological profiles of her characters. By page 100, I just didn't care. Others may like this one. It just wasn't for me."
3,Good historical fiction,"What's great about this book is that it ties the modern with the past without waxing sentimental. Like the romantic interests in this book, its drama is understated, and this allows us to focus on the mystery and absorbe the ambience of the time. However, it's a cursory view; we get a surface sensation of ancient Irish values and customs, and the why behind the how, but that is enough. Characters are somewhat chalky and limited to their observable aspects, but they interact well and the dialogue and emotional mood of each scene drives the story. The mystery may not surprise longterm mystery readers but the book as a whole is enjoyable, and I would recommend it to most readers."
2,"Slow, cliched, poorly written, tells but does not show","I too looked forward to reading this after seeing some good reviews. I read a lot of mysteries, if this is good writing then I don't get it. A lot of detail but cardboard characters I never felt I knew, I couldn't wait for it to end and didn't care who did it by that point. No drama, no excitement, just an excruciatingly slow read. Who cares?"
1,Too expensive,"It's not Amazon's fault that the Bears charge $30 for this overpriced hat...it definitely should be $15 or $20, and I consider it Highway Robbery to pay $30 for a hat for a team that looked so dismal in the 2nd half of their Super Bowl loss against the Colts, and I am a DIE HARD Cubs, Bears, and Bulls fan. I will NOT pay them $30 for one hat..No Way!"
1,BAD CHOICE - DO NOT USE,"The book I ordered said it was in good condition, but it came with missing pages. This was extremely upsetting because it is a language workbook, and it is vital to have the missing pages for my class. This was a bad investment, use someone else."
4,Thoughts on Aging,This is a fun book and I bought it to give to friends and family as a Birthday Gift.(For Gals over 60)
4,Good value,"Kent brushes last almost forever, but the prices have sky-rocketed over the years. This one is a very good value.Unfortunately, the product box arrived torn which was disappointing since I was giving it as a gift."
1,Never was able to get the song!,I was never able to download the song so it was a waste of my money! I will never do a mp3 download again
2,CorningWare French White 8-Piece Pop-Ins Bake-and-Serve Set,The items arrived on time. But I was not very happy with the product. It has covers that really are difficult to fit and not quite flexible as I had expected it to be.
4,Good product!,Corning always makes a good product. I have some trouble getting the tops off and have almost dropped the whole thing trying to get them off.
3,Sounds great remastered but...,"This CD has great sound (thanks to Bob Irwin And Vic Anesini), however three songs on the original album, Hot Fun In The Summertime, Everybody Is A Star and Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin) are in stereo on this remastered CD. The old edition of this CD, as on the original album, had these songs in mono. It would have been nice, since the running order of this CD is only twelve songs long, to have included the mono versions of these songs."
4,First had this on 8-track...,"Yea, 8-track. And as a young cat back then, I thought, ""man, this sounds so cool!"", S&FS; had so much sound to get on a mere 4x2 tracks its like you got the most important stuff first, vocals, horns, bass..so, it sounded live and all that funky energy was easily tranfered to the listener.Anywho, what I'm sayiing is; no matter the format or the remastering. It's one of the greatest albums of all time.By the way, why do the young people of today listen to that vile rap poison when this stuff is availible?"
5,"DANCE, DANCE, DANCE",THIS IS A PARTY DISC. EVERYTHING IS UPBEAT WHICH IS JUST WHAT WE ALL SEEM TO NEED NOW. I FORGOT HOW MUCH FUN THE '70S WERE.
4,pleasantly disappointed,"I hadn't heard Sly in years and was very excited to receive my cd in the mail. But how can you have a greatest hits of Sly and the Family Stone without ""Family Affair"". To say the least I was bitter and cried for oh 20 minutes to an hour, not continuously of course, I have a life after all, but i spread it out over a coupla days. I was able to keep track of this with my the elapsed time feature on my new Ronro digital watch, which by the way does not have ""Family Affair"" either. So if you want to hear ""Family Affair"" pick another cd, carefully, or Keb Mo' does a fine version on ""Big Wide Grin"". If you don't particularly care for the song, please diregard this message."
3,Airbrush holder,"This product holds the air brush alright, but the top piece with the hooks should be a bit more firmly attached to the base. It comes off too easily and can be a pain when you have your hands full with the brush. I guess if it is going in a permanent location a little glue would solve that problem."
1,introduction to religion,this book should be called - introduction to hindu religion.most of the book deals with explanations how hindu religionconnected to hindu temple.low quality pictures dont addanything.some two pages talk about eroticism.
1,Too small and not enough shade,"I have been driven completely bananas trying to get this sunshade to stay on - as soon as you get the top stretched over, the bottom flicks off (and vice versa) And I'm not alone - everyone I meet has had the same problem with the shade, its about 5cm too short and this makes it practically unusable.I also live in Queensland Australia. I don't know about northern hemisphere sun but silver does nothing to block it out over here. I have resorted to a black piece of sheet instead which works much better."
5,weird so many bad reviews .. it is really an amazing product :),"I don't understand the bad reviews, i have no problem whatsoever making this product fit my bugaboo, my baby use it for months during the hot summerit was really a must for me, never had a problem with it, stays put and works amazing to what is made for.."
2,Another disappointing Bugaboo accessory,I purchsed the sun shade hoping it would protect my daughter from the harsh summer sun. Unfortunately it's practically impossible to affix to the stroller. Chalk this up to another disappointing Bugaboo accessory. So far we only like the cup holder and the wheeled board (unless you also count the foam tires which really are great.)
1,"Good Idea, Poor Product","This is so poorly designed. If it fits on the bottom, it doesn't reach the top. If you manage to get the sunshade on, good luck getting it back on after you have to attend to your baby!"
2,Bugaboo Cameleon Sunshade,"Once again, we found a reason to drop more money into this pram.The sunshade seemed like a good idea as we moved from London to southern California. Taking it out of the package it looked like a quality product. The issue is that the fitting is so tight it will constantly slips right off."
5,"Great Pet ""Washroom""","This is a great way of having a litter box in a room, but completely camouflaged. It is a nice piece of furniture, and is perfect (especially if you have dogs) to keep the cat bowls on top so the dogs can't get to them. We love it!"
2,"Looks nice, but the cats don't like it...","It's too small and confining. I think I'm just going to turn it into a cabinet for other things. Maybe put some fabric or punched tin or copper in the little window.Disappointing, but you never know how cats will react to anything."
3,Only Complaint is Assembly,"This 'house' makes for a very innocuous cat box in the house.My only complaint is that assembly is time consuming and a couple of steps arerather tricky. But the instructions are pretty straight forward, and it's notcomplicated, just lengthy.Otherwise it's a good unit once assembled"
4,Kitty litter box disguiser,"This product is attractive and serves the purpose. My cat likes it fine. The product, of course comes disassembled. Instructions say that it does not require strong force to put on the devices that hold it together. I found that if I did not apply pretty good force in turning the screw-in parts, the house tended not to hold together. And the magnet on the door is not very strong. I think I can improvise with another magnet, but at the price I paid for this house, I do not feel that I should have had this problem. My cat has opened the door several times just from exiting the litter box. Other than this, it does what I bought it for and I have no more complaints."
4,Merry Pet Cat Washroom/Night Stand,This is a good product that is super easy to assemble and seems to be sturdy. It is a great way to hide your cat's litter box and keeps the litter from ending up all over the room. The only thing that I don't like is that it could be bigger. I have 3 cats and the size litter box that fits in it means I am cleaning it constantly. Other than that it is a good buy.
4,Great Purchase for Cat Lovers,"This was a great purchase. Nice and sturdy, the cats have plenty of room to move around and it can be discreetly placed anywhere."
1,don't buy,"I read all the negative reviews and also the good so I went ahead and ordered it. it took about two hours to put together.The last step the door, is no way made for this litter box cover only one opening for one hinge and even if I had a drill it is two long for the opening and also it will not be able to accomodate a breeze sytem or the hooded litter box I have now I have It would require a very small litter pan. I can only use it if I leave the door off and defeats the reason I wanted it.Really disapointed and feel like it was a waste."
2,Dog Owners Be Forewarned!,"I have wanted this attractive Pet Cat Washroom for a long time, but put off ordering it because of price. When it arrived, and after my husband had put it together, we were both pleased to have the litter box secreted in a piece of furniture--so much more attractive in our bedroom than a Booda Box. The white finish perfectly matched built in white cabinets, and we gained two more surfaces on which to place things. Even though we cleaned it every day, by day three our 45-pound dog had discovered it. Ugh! We caught him with his head completely inside of the box, selecting the delicacy he wanted from the shallow litter box. We immediately decided to use this piece of furniture as a pet house only. If we just had cats as pets, I would have rated this item four stars. Because the litter box lacks depth, too much litter was thrown out the door to justify five stars."
3,"A question to those who have bought this product, please?","I haven't bought this product yet, but I like the idea very much. However, the Amazon ""Product Features"" section says it measures 18.5 x 16.5 x 18.5 inches. But, the ""Product Details"" section says it measures 20 x 18 x 25 inches. What are the correct measurements? Thanks to anyone who can answer this for me!"
3,cat washroom/night stand,I like this to hide the litterbox. It is nice looking and the cats like it. I wish that it had some kind of plastic coating on the inside to protect it. they tend to urinate and hit the walls on the inside of night stand.
5,Happy Kitties!,"I have 2 cats and they LOVE their new washroom!! We have recently remodeled the bathroom where we keep their litter box and this was the perfect answer to ""hiding"" their litter box! When showing off the new bathroom, everyone has gone crazy over the washroom!! By far one of my best purchases from Amazon...super fast delivery, easy assembly and a beautiful addition to my home. p.s. the kitties think so too!!!"
2,Do NOT buy!!,"This thing is really bad! Only the smallest of litter boxes will actually fit inside. You also must buy one that's not very high due to the way the door opening is made. Because of the tiny litter box with low sides that has to be used in this thing, litter gets kicked all over and urine ends up all over the inside of this thing. It was a complete nightmare to try to keep up with all the messes from the cat urine and litter everywhere. I tried to use this thing for a few months, but then when it picked up so much urine odor that it was smelling up my house, it had to go. This was a huge waste of good money."
1,Piece of Junk,I bought this litter box hider with high hopes but the actual product is very poorly made with cheap and flimsy materials. The particleboard became shredded during assembly due to the cheap materials so I was unable to even put the thing together! It was a very frustrating and disappointing experience. I have pelnty of experience with furniture assembly - and this piece was probably the cheapest quality I have ever come across. You would be better off spending a bit more on a quality piece of furniture and converting it to you litter box needs than buying this piece of junk.
4,good product,"No more ugly, dirty cat litter to look at--might be too small for large cats. Litter pan is rather small and has to be changed frequently--every two days since I don't scoop. Easy assembly--no specific tools needed. Looks good in our bathroom not quite something I would have in any other room--maybe the laundry room. I can highly recommend this product for someone like me."
1,Poorly Made!,"I bought this exact litter box furniture 2.5 years ago. Not even four weeks into having it, the back wall started to fall off. It did NOT contain the odor (and I clean the litter EVERYDAY). The bottom of started to crumble so I had to put a piece of contact paper down. I bought it at the original price of $129.99 and now see it sells for $69.99. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. SPEND A LITTLE MORE FOR A PIECE OF QUALITY FURNITURE. THIS IS GARBAGE!"
1,"Looks great, but it's not.","This product is a great idea. Too bad they didn't put a little extra effort in the materials used for its construction. Product is flimsy, difficult to put together and very brittle. When putting it together the holes didn't line up for the cams and dowels and they pre-drilled to the vaneer making it difficult to put together without breaking it. Save yourself the hassle and buy a sturdier product for a little more money."
3,It works,"One of the Amazon customer photos shows you can hold toilet paper on the middle shelf. I was not able to. My bathroom is quite small so I was looking forward to having that storage for toilet paper, so I'm giving this 3 stars because the dimensions were not right. Though, my cat seems to love this. My suggestion is that people use wood glue for the back piece since it is flimsy. Overall I would recommend this product."
3,It's OK,"It looks nice, our huge cats fit through the opening, but somehow they manage to pee outside of the inner litter box. I even put a deeper one in, cutting the opening larger, but they still occasionally make a mess. The idea was to prevent litter from getting all over the floor, but they manage to still make a mess that way, too."
2,Whole lotta Meh...,"Looks great online but when it arrives things don't look as good. Trying to hide the litter box is never easy. We thought this would blend well in our guest bathroom so we bought it. Cleaning up all the crappy foam and cardboard pieces took longer than putting it together which should have been a hint of how this was going to work. After two weeks of ""use"" and whatnot it's started to wobble back and forth. The door isn't level so it doesn't close all the time. I went to move it and the top wood piece came off leaving the metal ""twist locks"" in place but totally disconnecting. I ended up using Gorilla glue to put it back on. A few other places have split because it's crappy particle board.Buyer beware!"
2,"ehh, i think i paid too much","i purchase this for my cats. the setup instruction were simple and easy to follow. however, after assembling the thing i went to move it into my bathroom. the top shelf came off. it thing not very sturdy and has lost my confidence in it. i bought it for 109, if it was cheaper like 75 or 60 dollars then this product would be well worth the investment.don't be like me and fall prey to their opportunistic profiteering with less than acceptable quality. provided to you at a premium, of course."
3,"Great, once we got all the right pieces","As I was putting this together for our new kitten, I realized that the door they had sent to us wasn't going to fit. I called to have them send me a new one and based on my conversation with the woman in customer service, this must be a recurring problem for them because she knew exactly what the problem was. They told me that it would arrive in 7 to 10 days, but after two weeks, I had to call them again to see where it was. No one seemed to know if my order had even been sent to the warehouse, which was incredibly frustrating. I asked them to send the door overnight, since I'd waited so long, which they did. Finally, we have this thing put together and our litter box is tucked away. Unfortunately, the whole process was a real hassle."
2,"Great idea, but...","This is great idea for ""hiding"" your litter box except that there is litter outside the piece all of the time. We bought a large litter pan but it doesn't contain the litter from getting all through the interior and on the floor outside the door. We had a booda before and yes, there was litter outside of that although it wasn't as much. The booda didn't look as nice as this, but I would choose that if I had to decide again. Now we have litter all over the floor and it would be nearly impossible to keep up with it.Also, we have a large cat (11 pounds) and she opens the door when she walks out. Our smaller cat can go in and out no problem.There are no air vents so the smell is contained inside and can get pretty bad if you don't clean box out at least once a day."
3,Looks nice but smelly,"I ordered this as a pet house for my small dogs. It arrive quickly, was easy to put together, and looks nice. However, some of the holes were drilled too big and the bolts would not fit properly. This was for only 2 holes so it does not affect the stability, but buyer beware. The worst part is it has a VERY STRONG chemical smell. My dogs won't go near it and I have had to open a window to help air out the room. Hopefully it will loose the offensive smell."
3,Looks fine - little small,This product looks pretty good. Was not that hard to put together. The hole in the door is cut too low. You have to have an extremely shallow kitty litter box so it doesn't show. I have to medium to large size cats and they fit in it just fine.
1,Wrong dimensions on Amazon!,"While I liked the looks of this product, I got it all assembled only to find out it did not fit in the area I had planned for it. The final dimensions are 20.5""L x 19""W x 25""H and NOT ""Measures 18.5 x 16.5 x 18.5 inches"", as stated on Amazon's product page. I disassembled it and sent it back. Not a very efficient way to do business, Amazon!"
5,Cat Washroom,I purchased this product because I was tired of seeing a litterbox. Its PERFECT!!!! Its in my hallway and nobody knows whats in it. When I tell people its my cats bathroom they think it as absolutely adorable. Assembly was easy and its great quality.
4,awesome design...but just OK quality,"The quality fits for the money, you will not be getting high end furniture for this price... so that is why it is 4 stars, with that being said, it is an awesome product to hide a cat box in plain sight. I bought the Iris, or isis or whatever high sided litter box and it works awesome, I know some people complain that you can't get into the corners with the scooper with that box, but I use litter box liners and I don't have a problem at all, I scoop daily and use the litter genie (awesome product!) Oh, and the piece had a oil-paint type smell when we first got it, but that went away after a day or two...meets CA guidelines, so I assume it is safe enough."
5,wish i had had these years ago,"We have two of these and are very happy with how they look. They are attractive and look so much better than a litter box. One tip that worked for us is that we purchased a fairly shallow litter pan to put inside versus the one that is paired wih it on Amazon. It makes it easier for the cat to enter the structure. I am so addicted to Amazon, but I actually went to a pet store to pick out the litter pan to make sure it was the correct one that would work."
2,door too small,"Very easy to put together and it looks really nice...BUT...the doorway is 5"" from the bottom and most litter boxes are taller than that so there is not enough room for my cat to get through the door."
5,100% satisfied !!,"We live in a relatively small house ( 2 BR 1 1/2BA ) and have to multi-purpose our half bath. This bathroom serves as a bathroom, laundry room and cat litter box area. I had been looking all over for some solution to the unsightly cat box in the corner -- When I saw The Merry Pet Cat Washroom/Night Stand it seemed the perfect answer. It was so easy to put together -- I did it by myself in about 20 minutes. The pieces were sturdy - not flimsy at all. All pieces were clearly marked, even the hardware were separated in small plastic baggies and marked, and the instructions clear and concise. The photo does not do it justice -- it is much better looking in person. With complete confidence I would highly recommend this to anyone."
3,A little small,"The unit is well made and seems like a good idea. My (not too bright) cats, however, have made a mess of it. It's too small for our high sided cat box to fit inside. When we put a smaller box in that fits, the cats threw litter everywhere and often stuck their rears out the door window instead of staying in the box.Now we just leave the door open with the high sided box, but it doesn't look as nice. A small, very tall litter box may be the answer.At least my wife doesn't drop her laundry into the litter box anymore."
3,cute but not what I expected,I selected this because I felt it could be versatile in any space based on its size. I am keeping the product however I am not entirely satisified with it. First while constructing the top and bottom pieces were not cut to the correct size which caused some difficulties in construction. The size once completed was not what I expected. The litterbox area is small and I purchased the hooded litterbox to go inside and it sits right to the opening. I will go back to my domed litterbox and use this as a hideout.
4,Happy Kitty!!!!,"I have four cats and one likes her own area, and this did the trick. The item was a put together project very easy. The only complaint I have is the back could be made of stronger material. With all the wood/plastic products out there they could do better. I had to use a litter box with enclosed top so my cat did not wet out side her box. With all that said it is nice looking and with me keeping in my main bathroom it is not an eye sore."
1,Don't bother,"Too many problems with this item and we haven't even used it yet. Parts didn't fit. When we requested replacement parts, we were sent the wrong ones. Too much of a headache."
1,Helpless,Directions were poor!!!!! They were basic-not for a beginner-not clear & messed up the whole project! I put the top on backwards (because the directions did not make it clear) & the screws from the bottom poped out-now it has no bottom or door-there were no holes to fit door onto house. I definately will not ever buy from this company again!!!!!! They have received one letter from me with NO reply-Very poor customer sevice!!!!! Wasted money-and I don't have a lot to waste!
4,Great product!,"I love this product, but one thing to note is that the description said it fits normal size litter boxes. The litter box has to be pretty small to fit inside, and I wouldn't consider it to be very standard. It works for my cat just fine, but some cats may require larger litter boxes. My cat is only 11 pounds."
4,2nd one I've bought,"I bought my first one a few years ago but unfortunately the back and bottom got ruined from use. You need to use a covered or partially covered litter box inside this or a cat will miss and the material will dissipate! So anyway, cheap enough that I replaced and this did last a few years. Nothing else like it looks great the extra shelf holds a lot of odds and ends in baskets and matches my decor...people will walk right by and not notice it's a litter box. Acceptable pre-fab item"
4,Nice,"Easy to assemble. It hides the litter box nicely and would be 5 stars if it were an inch longer for the litter box to fit. As is, you need to position the litter box a little to get the door to close 100% but its not a bid deal."
1,Give me a break...,"I was excited when I found this item as it sounded like a great idea. Being able to hide the litter box is a plus, but adding what appeared to be a beautiful hiding place made this product look like a great option. Please do not let the pretty photos fool you! First of all, the item is not even close to worth what you pay for it. It is made of cheap particle board. I even question whether it would have functioned for more than a week. I had to have my husband reinforce every aspect of this item with glue and nails. When the product arrived, the box looked like it had seen better days. Two parts were missing which made it even more difficult. I wish I could have rated this product a zero. Totally not worth the time, the effort, and the money for this cheaply made item."
1,Merry Pet Cat Washroom/Night Stand Pet House,"About two months ago I purchased the mentioned above item. when I went to put it together I had 2 ""B"" panels, no ""A""panel. I called the company, told them my problem and was told it would take 6 to 10 weeks to receive my ""A"" panel.The panel came almost 7 weeks after the call.I went to put the stand together today [2-20-10] and was not happy with what I found. I got to step #6, figure 6 and tried to put panel ""C"" on the unit.The hardware didn't line upwith panel ""A"" holes. I am not now or ever will be happy with this purchase! As far as I'm concerned regardless of my problems, I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone!"
2,"Looks good, smells bad","Lovely piece of furniture that now resides on the lanai as a cat cozy/side table. Looks good, but when my cats used it as a litter box the smell was awful. Don't know what the difference is...but went back to a normal plastic litter box and the smell isn't bad at all. Same litter, same cats, same small bathroom area...big change in odor. Friends always comment on the fact that we have 5 cats and the house never smelled like cats or litter boxes. Big change during the month I tried to use this product as a litter box. Wonder if anyone else had this problem."
1,Good Idea - Bad Design - Too Small,"Great idea but not large enough to hold a large, deep covered litter box - consequently my laminate flooring is ruined from urine accidents over the edge of the litter box. Works ok for a pet bed or pet toy box."
3,product review,"The first one I bought was sized properly for the litter box. This second one was just a tad smaller, my litter box didn't fit.Quality is okay, but could be better. Some of the hardware falty."
3,A good solution,I searched serveral sites for a reasonably priced Litter Box cover. This one was one of the most affordable I found. The unit was very easy to put together and is reasonably attractive for what it is. My cats seemed anxious at first so I left the door open the first day. Now they seem to be happy with the added privacy this allows.
3,As it is pictured - it is!,It was fairly easy to assemble. I would buy white if I bought it again. I find that my cats sometimes hang on the edge and sometimes I have to clean up on the floor but that could be the combination of the litter tray I bought and my 16 year old cats just not as agile as they used to be. If you need to hide a litter box in a small place - it works.
3,"Good, But...","I just opened the box for this item and the top front left corner of the top piece is dented from shipping. In order to get a replacement piece through Amazon I have to apply for the new piece and ship the old item back within 30 days. I don't know about you, but I have no time for that. FAIL.Also, don't assume that your standard litter pan with cover will fit in this cabinet, it WONT. I now have to purchase the recommended pan with side cover for $9. Not a big deal, but a little disappointing.Overall, looks good, was super easy to assemble and hoping it stands up to use by our three cats."
3,remember it's for a litter box,I purchased this with the intention to use it for a tv stand bc of the shelf for the DVD player however this is way too short for that. I read that it was 30 inches and it's shorter than 25 inches. it will make a nice nightstand however I'm uncertain if I want my cat pooping that close to my head !! it is well made with the exception of the back panel that is flimsy and had scuff marks and missing spots of paint all down one side. parts were missing such as dowel rods and plugs for holes if you choose not to install towel bar. this item is better left as bathroom decor to hide a litter box but who has a bathroom that big lol otherwise easy to assemble and sturdy for what it is...and for what it is it's very overpriced!
1,This Will Smell After a Few Months and Can't Get Rid of It!,"Beware! We loved this when we first bought it--it looks good, and even seemed to control the cat box litter odor. However, even with keeping the box really clean, after a while the wood (particle board?) picks up the urine smell, so the whole thing makes the room it's in smell horrible. We finally put it in our garage (without the litter box), where it still smelled so bad it stunk up the whole garage."
4,Amazon.com purchase,Good value love they style. My complaint I received it 3 weeks later than when promised. I should have been notified it would take a total of 4 weeks to get.
1,Incorrect Parts,"I just received this item in the mail and we were very excited to get it all set up. Unfortunately, the parts didn't all fit together. Practically nothing lined up for part ""C"", i.e. the shelf part that tops the box but isn't the top part. Literally, the holes & grooves simply didn't line up. We called the customer service number and haven't heard back from them. I don't want to send the whole thing back, but I might have to if they don't respond & send us a replacement part! I saw a complaint about this earlier, but figured they had this straightened out by now. I cannot recommend this product."
1,Worthless,"For the price I paid I figured I would at least get all wood. I was wrong. The back is load bearing cardboard(or some kind of thin dense material). It wasn't even cut to the correct size. The parts that were wood, we're of low quality. One of the supports for the top split on me. I Had to glue and clamp it."
1,Misleading,"According to the measurements listed, my cats covered litter box should fit in this unit. WRONG! Not only did it not fit, it was actually WAY too big. The product is very cheap material and would break easily if you assembled it the wrong way. I think this is a great idea, but unfortunately it's poorly executed. Luckily, Amazon gave me a full refund."
5,Must have!,Very nice looking toilet for your kitty..it looks million times better then normal plastic toilet which is hard to find place for as it looks out of place everywhere.This just fits into interior of the house or flat and no one will even notice it..
1,Doesn't Even Fit Together,"After putting the first two boards together, I noticed how loose the pieces were after the screws were in. When I tried put on the third piece, when the screws aligned to the holes, the boards decorative edge got in the way of allowing the two boards to screwed together. I would have had to saw off a piece of the edge to even get this thing together. I've bought and put together 20 or more Ikea furniture and never had this problem. This product is very cheaply made. Save yourself a headache and skip buying this one."
4,Decorative way to hide the litter box,This product fit the bill for hiding my cat's litter box. My only disappointment is that the door hinges aren't very sturdy so I had to change them.
3,KITTY WASHROOM,"While I do enjoy the look of this, the odor is a huge problem. I am used to cleaning my old litter box every two days, this one has to be done every day, if not more than once a day, otherwise the odor is unbelievably strong. It holds a nice large litter pan inside, but that only holds in the smells. The shelf directly on top is too small to put anything other than maybe one towel. All in all, I like the look of it, but not the way the smells hang inside it...."
2,"Doesn't stand up to cat pee, lasted about 6 months.","Hello,We received this item in early December 2010.We got about 6 months out of it.If you have a female cat or male cat that can keep in the tray then it is probably a decent product.If you have sprayer it won't last very long. Perhaps if you lined it with thick plastic you could get more life out it.Many of the parts that appeared to be solid wood are disintegrating and revealing themselves to be MDF or something of that ilk.It did originally look better than most competitive products we have tried.Now it is just falling apart.Looks like it is back to plastic for us.Best of luck in your quest for a stealth litter tray."
2,Eh not so great,This looks nice but it is not very study at all. You should set it up close to where you are going to permanently place it. I doubt it will be able to survive a move. We are thinking about getting a different litter box. When the cats jump out of this one the litter comes out with them so there is litter all in front of the box.
3,Hides your litter box and looks like a nice piece of furniture!,"My girlfriend wanted to buy something to hide the litter box in so it wasnt in plain site. Its easy to put together but the one I received didnt align perfectly and had to file one of the sides for it to align. If it werent for that I ould be giving this 5 stars. But at this price you expect it to be perfect when putting it together. This would have frustrated a lot of buyers possibly to the point of returning it.Once we put this together we also found out that the typical literbox with the covers wont fit. You need to buy a smaller one without the cover for it to fit. That wasnt much of an issue since we could get one at walmart for 4 bucks.Another tip is to line the inside with the plastic see through sticky paper used for books (sorry, the word for it evades me right now) prior to assembling the whole thing so the wood doesnt absob any smells and its easier to just wipe and clean."
1,WAY too Big,I have a small condo and was looking for something to hide the litter box in. Using the measurements given I thought it would be okay. Well it wasn't. So now this is in the basement and in addition I have to find a litter pan to fit the inside. This was a waste of money. the piece is not bad looking and fairly easy to put together.
4,Great litter box hideaway!,This was a great purchase. I have it in my laundry room and you can't even tell there's a litter box in it! I've had several guests comment on it wanting one like it. It was very easy to put together. I had it put together in less than 15 minutes. The only complaint is that does not use a standard size litter box - I had to buy 2 litter boxes before I could find one that would fit - I should have measured the space before shopping.
1,Unsafe and poor quality,"Very disappointing after readking other reviews. I'll make this to the point.1) Several pieces came scrathed, dented, and chipped2) Some pieces did not fit into the pre-drilled holes3) Price is too expensive for the poor quality4) Most alarming!...There is a strong unpleasant fume that is generated by this product. Either the paint or stain lacquering is generating a fume that I feel is unsafe to be inhaled by anyone in the house. I do not want my pet breathing in these fumes. I'm sure anyone concerned about their pet would not either.Fortunetly, Amazon is being cooperative about replacing it. But I'm afraid that I going to get another defected product."
3,"Very eye appealing, but scratches easily","This item was very easy to assemble and is very eye appealing. The only negative thing I could say about this item is that it scratches very easily, so use care when assembling. I am going to have to paint this washroom soon because there are scratches from assembly and normal wear and tear. But, overall, a very nice cat washroom."
2,Don't buy if your cat sprays high!,"I was SO excited to get this cabinet, because we have a ranch house and not much room, and litter boxes are a real eyesore. The cabinet is lovely, and pretty solid. Then the problem: I put a large size litter pan in it, and let our 3 cats use it for 1-2 days. When I went to clean it, I opened the door and pulled the pan out, and splash! Urine all over the floor. Our older male cat who likes to urinate upwards, had sprayed all over the walls of the cabinets, creating a generous pee puddle under the litter pan. Gross. I can't use this cabinet! I ended up buying the Goodstuff Hidden Litter Box that looks like a plant, and since it's all plastic on the inside with no seams, it's worked perfectly."
3,Works fine,"Works fine and looks way better than a regular litter box sitting out, but litter gets EVERYWHERE. Before this we used the Booda dome and had very minimal litter. Now we have to vacuum the litter up daily and somehow it still gets everywhere. We have the recommended blue box with shield inside with a huge mat down below it but still. Boo! If the Booda dome fit inside that would be amazing!"
2,It was a HUGE dissapointment,"I really did not like this book. It started out fun and interesting, but then it got boring. First of all I thought that Amy was a real snob. After that thing with the pool Chris tried to make it up to her, but Amy wouldn't listen. All she cared about was herself. Also, I think that she got mad at him for dumb reasons. But, I did think the ending was sweet."
4,Lube the zipper and you won't be disappointed,"Good single-ply canvas bag, just a fold on the bottom and sewn on the sides. I use this to carry emergency tools in my car.I also was initially disappointed with the zipper -- it wouldn't move at all. I sprayed someTri-Flowinto a rag and ran the rag along both sides of the zipper, and it instantly became perfect."
2,not like other Klein bags: avoid,"I'm disappointed in this canvas bag. The zipper doesn't run smooth on it. I think Klein knows what a problem this is because they include a nylon pull on the zipper to give you better leverage. A much better Klein bag in the same price range is their Cordura ballistic nylon one. Essentially the same price, a more sturdy bag, and far better fit and finish."
4,Heavy duty!,"This Klein bag is very durable. Takes a little time for the zipper to wear in,But overall a great product."
3,Needs better illustrations,"It's an easy read and it gives a lot of good information, but I think the illustrations were lacking. Especially the sections of tying knots (it seemed like he was missing steps at times) and equipment descriptions (he'd name off all sorts of gear, but not show a picture of each one). The pictures are in black and white, so it didn't seem like you'd have to try very hard to include lots of them.I wasn't thinking of using the book as a training manual, but I wanted to make sure I had the concepts right when taking my classes, so I would know the questions I needed to ask."
5,"Practise, but be aware",that the best instructions you get from Luebben and the skills you acquire are no match for Mother Nature. Craig Luebben is dead after being hit by debris from falling ice in the North Cascades 2009.
3,Garden Rocker,"I ordered this item for my husband it came, but was missing 2 velcro straps so it does slip around unlike it's advertisement on here!!"
5,Inspiring,"I was introduced to her last album by my brother in law, while in England. We couldn't get her music out of our heads. Finally bought the album (over a year ago), and was not disappointed. She is now a favourite of ours (my 7 year old son and me). This new album shows an artist who continues to mature. Each album is better than the previous one. Truly an artist with loads of talent...Highly recommended to all."
5,Another cd worth buying. This girl rocks,Jaci is such an inspiring artist. She not only sings very well but shows her love for Christ in good original songs. I recommend that you buy this cd and listen to Sweet Surrender. That's an awesome song and Jaci sings it well. So.. don't hesitate.. go and buy it now.
2,um.....ya.,"If you liked the samples you won't necessarily like this cd. I bought it thinking it sounded cool. It doesn't, if you like Latin-influenced repetitive pop, go ahead. I myself like the sort of Latin flavour, but most of this cd is fairly slow. The one highlight would be Every Time I Fall, but not worth the money. If you liked a Celine Dion cd ALL the way through, you might like this. But if you want upbeat Christian music, think Michelle Tumes or Wow Hits 2003 or 2001."
1,blessed,"jaci velasquez has come a long way. I first heard of Jaci a couple of years ago when she was just starting out. In fact, i was fortunate enought to hear her sing in person. I also saw first hand, the sweet spirit that she conveyed and I immediatly became a fan. As a person whom I've talked to briefly I have witnessed the joy and love for the Lord that she shares in concert. God has given her a talent and an opportunity to reach milllions of people not only in this country but in many more.I know that God has big plans in her artisitc life because of her openess to share the message with all her fans. I encourage everyone to hear to her music and listen to the message."
5,Very talented,"Jaci Velasquez is one very talented individual. She's so amazing as a singer and its crystal clear that she's a great singer. The songs in her cd are wonderful, positive and hopeful. She's got such a beautiful voice. Its definately worth buying. Can't wait for her next cd! The songs definately fall more into a soft pop category, so if you like that sort of music, then this just might be it for you."
5,Jaci Velasquez,"I have always LOVED jaci. I haven't heard this one yet, but I know I'll LOVE it! JACI ROCKS!"
2,NOT HER BEST!!,"JACI HAS A GIFT THATS NO JOKE! BUT SHES AN UNPERSONABLE PERSON WHO HAS LET EVERYTHING GET TO HER HEAD! THAT MAKES THIS ALBUM NO GOOD TO ME BEING I'VE MET HER AND WASN""T IMPRESSED. SHE IS NOT A STRONG SINGER. SINGERS SUCH AS CRYSTAL LEWIS DESERVE THE POPULARITY SHE HAS CAUSE THEY DESERVE IT. STAY IN THE SECULAR LATIN MARKET AND STOP PRETENDING YOUR A MINISTER! FOCUS!"
3,Great Opera,"The young Del Monaco is great, this was done before he lost the ability to sing piano and forgot how to breathe. Barbieri is a great Azucena, and of course Bastianini is superb. Leonora is serviceable. Three stars for being overpriced."
5,Works on hot flashes,"I stopped taking Estroven because I need to avoid soy and black cohosh. I noted that red clover was among its ingredient deck, so I gave this product a try. One pill at night and no more hot flashes. I realize that everyone's biology is different, but I have had such good luck with this that I wanted to share my experience."
5,I LOVE THIS THING!,"This machine is simply great, I've never ever had a problem with it, at first it's a little difficult to use and I had to read the manual like 3 times, once you understandt it it's really easy to use, I had lots of LP records that weren't able to get on CD and now I burned them on my Philips CDR775BK and it's JUST GREAT! I bet the people who have said they had problems with it it's because they didn't read the manual. BUT THIS PRODUCT YOU WON'T REGRET IT!"
1,Don't buy it!,Ever since I bought this unit I have had serious problems. It is now my 3rd time to send it back to the store I bought it in.Problems I had were as follows-:(i) It seems to hang (like a PC) for some reason. This is intermittent and happens when either recording or just palying new CD's.(ii) It is very slow to load up certain blank CD's which I recorded. And I mean 3 / 4 minutes.(iii) I received OPC Errors when using certain blank CD's.You would be better off saving and buying teh Pioneer PDR W839 or someting similar.Whatever you do...stay away from Philips!!
1,dont buy this!!,"where do i start.dont buy this..i got it in march,as a present,after 2 days i had to return it..the recordings were all distorted after burning..returned it,started doing it again,so i returned it again.the whole time im talking with the support people..they tell you to unplug machine for 1 minute..stupid..my recorder was having more problems..freezing ..so i returned it again,i just wanted it to be easy..and its not..if you get this machine itll be the biggest head ache youve ever had..when i returned it the 3rd time ..to circuit city,i was going toget a refund,so i could get something else, they wouldnt let me ,they had a 3 strikes program,so now they took it and will have the piece of junk for 10 days.so i can get it back and have the same problems over and over again..its really a piece of junk..should someone who pays that much money for anythinghave to deal with such junk,evidentlly so if you buy this product..BEWARE COS I TOLD YOU SO!!"
1,"I, too, thought I'd get more use out of it",I've had it for almost 2 years and now it just isn't working right 90% of the time. I'm ready to toss the S.O.B. but I am struggling to figure out a reasonable cost alternative for home-studio CD mastering and reproduction.Damn - thought it would last longer....
2,"problematic, doesn't take many blank cd's, poor use for dj","The use of this machine is fairly easy and there are some cool things like being able to type in text for each cd & song, albeit tedious. I dj from vinyl and my first problem was the inability to make track/ hash marks while i was in a mix, or even the ablility to do it while dubbing another copy. it accepts VERY few blank cd's to begin with (had mst luck with fujifilm multi- purpose which are now discontinued) and will refuse even the ones it had previously accepted on a whim. also seemingly randomly would record improperly and play back poorly, not to mention it wouldn't always play in other cd players (cd's i had made on this unit). it did record a couple things for me, i just had to deal with not being able to separate the tracks, hence 2 stars instead of 1. So unless that's your case, don't waste your time- it's pretty much junk."
2,Fun Product: Just Pray It Doesn't Break,"I've had the Philips CDR775 for about a year now. I love the ability to record CDs, but I think maybe I should have shopped around for a better product.My biggest complaint with Philips is that their support is awful. They have idoits with no training answering the phones. You can actually hear them reading through the same notes you can find on the web. Call with a complex problem and they ask dumb questions like ""are your cables plugged in?""My second complaint is that with fast dubbing, the deck adds a half second of blank time between tracks. Therefore, don't bother copying a continuous play CD. They sound really bad."
1,This product is a waste of money,"You'll be guaranteed disappointment if you waste your money on this item. I know.I purchased this unit new, and it worked great for 14 months. I recorded both CDs and my piano playing (mics right into the back of the Philips unit) for family and it was flawless. I'm not sure what the deal is with other reviews about non-Philips CD-Rs, but Memorex CDs worked fine in my Philips unit.The problem is that two months out of warranty, the CD-R module went bad. I mean really bad, to the tune of $641 and $617 as the two estimates to fix it. Unit won't record, won't playback on one side, and now is a very expensive single-CD player. Would you pay twice as much as new to get it fixed? Neither would I.After discussions with other CD-RW owners, there are clearly better options out there; read other reviews. . .but if you choose to purchase this item, you will be hoping it's not one of the many many lemons that Philips has issued.Let the buyer beware!"
4,pretty good,"This item was not only plays cds, it burns cds. I am still trying to burn songs off of napster, though. This item copies tapes too, which can really help."
1,"PHILLUPS CDR775,,,, POOR CHOICE","BUYER BE WHERE ,,, I BOUGHT THIS MACHINE AND WORKED FOR THREE DAYS TRYING TO GIVE IT A FAIR SHAKE TO WORK ... I THOUGHT I MIGHT BE MISSING SOMETHING SO I TOOK IT TO A FRIEND WHO IS A COMPUTER ENGINEER , THINKING MAYBE I DIDN'T GET IT.. HE WORKED ON THE THING ONE ENTIRE EVENING AND SAID THAT IT DOSEN'T WORK ,, WE CALLED THE PHILLUPS HOT LINE WHOS ONLY ADVISE WAS TO TURN THE THING OFF LET IT SI FOR ONE HOUR AND TRY AGAIN,,, I DID IT ANYWAY TO SAY I TRIED IT ALL... THANK GOODNESS I BOUGHT THIS AT A REPUTABLE DEALER WHO THE TOOK IT BACK AND THE SALESPERSON GOT ME ANOTHER CDR775 BY PHILLUPS . WE OPENED THE NEW BOX. PLUGGED IT IN AND WASTED 5 MORE CD BLANKS TRYING TO MAKE THIS WORK... IT WOULDN'T FINALIZE .. NOR WOULD IT COMPLETELY RECORD A WHOLE DISC,, NOR WOULD IT PLAY ANY PART OF IT . I RETURNED THE SECOND AND I AM NOW REVIEWING YOUR WEB SITE TO BUY ONE THAT WORKS.... BE CAREFUL...."
2,Taking a chance,"Had this unit for 18 months and the problems encountered were that when you recorded in the dub mode for a period of time, it never went back to normal speed (to ""listen"" mode) which in turn made you lose the cd you were recording on. Had problems with ""check cd"" when i was near the end, so watch out for that or use cdrw cd's so you can start from where the error occured at. I took it back in for repairs, and the replacement one went bad just as the first one did."
5,A Great Party Album!,"It is almost impossible to believe that people can play as fast and as tight as Fanfare Ciocarlia. These twelve guys can play like no one else I've ever heard. The music is not only fast, but beautiful and uplifting. This is definitly one of the best albums of 2000!"
2,Common tape mechanism failure,"The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that I hear Sony may have fixed the problem in ones made after mid 2009. The tape door won't close and, upon researching it on some support forum, I found what seemed like hundreds of people having this same problem. Some were able to solve it using various methods (some by-the-book, some completely illegitimate), but it seemed like most people were stuck with a broken camera that Sony wants to charge to fix it more than what you will pay to buy it."
1,Bad buying decision,"My video cam died and I needed something to shoot my son's football games. This was a rushed purchase and a bad idea. It's a Sony...so it's not that it's a bad product, it's just the the picture quality (resolution) is really bad. My fault for going cheap??? Probably. But, be warned.On different note, I bought a separate, non-Sony, battery as the battery supplied had miserable life...but that seems sadly typical for the batteries provided with camcorders from everyone, not just Sony."
4,Great for the money.,This is a great little camera for the money. I would highly suggest it to anyone on a budget.
2,"soft controls, yuck","most of the playback and adjustment controls are soft touch via the flip out panel. that is very awkward and undesirable. it would be fine if that was a backup/parallel method, but forcing these fat fingers of mine to try and hit the little pixels, and driving down through all those levels of controls makes me crazy. i will be paying for the cheap price of this half baked item for many frustrating months to come, until i can justify getting a more well designed product."
1,Unacceptable quality,"I bought this camera after my previous Sony model died 10 DAYS AFTER THE EXTENDED WARRANTY was up. Anyway, the image is very grainy. There seem to be thousands of microscopic black dots in the images - both on the viewfinder screen and the tape (played on a tv). I called Sony support & they were not helpful at all. They suggested I send it in. I'm returning it to get a different brand."
2,Not very happy.,Very very disappointed with this toy. The pieces do not come apart easily. Nor do they go together easily. Children need too much help from adults to play with the toys. The headache is NOT worth the money spent on it. Way overpriced too.
2,Dissatisfaction rating,"I'm generally disappointed at what the book seems to promise and what it delivers. My take on the book is that it is not thorough enough, and topped with a number of typos and reference errors. I find that several examples and references are hard to follow. Perhaps expanding on the explanation on the examples would help. I would also recommend adding a CD for examples. I wouldn't mind paying more to be able to follow the concepts and fully understand them. Afterall, this is business analysis with ""Microsoft Excel."" There's just no ""Excel"", just text. Trying to go through this book is more like reading a cliff note version of a ""real"" book (again, hard to follow leading to discouragement and disappointment. If you're patient, you can find some values, no doubt, just be prepared to spend some time more than you would expect, and to reference a couple more books for validation/clarification of concepts discussed in this book."
2,Business Analysis with Microsoft Excel,"Overall, I was not impressed with this book. I was hoping to get a book with examples of functions for use in financial analysis. Instead, the book focused more on financial analysis fundamentals."
3,Just another accounting text,"I got this book based on the enthusiastic reviews on Amazon, but was really disappointed when what I got was really just another general accounting textbook. Don't get me wrong: as an accounting text it works just fine, and if that's what you need this is a fine addition to your library. However, I wanted a book that dealt with more sophisiticated number-crunching and modeling techniques, and Carlberg's book just doesn't cut it. I eventually (after selling the Carlberg book) got Tom Y. Sawyer's ""Pro Excel Financial Modeling"", which is a lot closer to what I wanted - detailed information on how to set up a financial model and create forecasts. Best of all, this fine book was under $5! That said, I would still consider buying Carlberg's book again if it were less than $10, it is a well-written accounting reference."
4,Very good but it is made of demos & whatnot,"I have all of Eva's CDs but ""No Boundaries"" due to how hard it is to get. As for this Cd, it's very much better than most fully produced music out there but if you compare it to her other CDs, no--it isn't as good. But if this is the worst Eva CD there is, it's still a testament to just how good she was. Manufactured singers should hope to sound this great. American Tune is worth owning and giving to friends and family."
4,Beautiful as usual,"If you love Eva's other album's ""Songbird"" and ""Imagine"" then you'll love this one. The format is the same with some jazzy blues and beautiful ballads. My favorite is ""True Colors"" which is surprisingly better than Cyndi Lauper's version. I also like ""Drowning in the Sea of Love"", ""Yesterday"", and ""American Tune"". There is also an amazing Irish song, ""Dark Eyed Molly"" that will give you chills! The remaining songs are enjoyable but not as great as the ones above.It's such a wonderful surprise when I see another collection of Eva's past recordings released. I thank her family for sharing her beautiful work with us!"
5,YET ANOTHER EXCELLENT Collection From Miss Cassidy,"I'm still floored that so much unreleased recorded material by the late Eva Cassidy remains unheard, but I'm always grateful for a new collection...and American Tune does not disappoint. From the bluesy ""Drowning In A Sea Of Love"" to her beautiful cover of Cyndi Lauper's ""True Colors"" to the extraordinary ""You Take My Breath Away,"" Eva Cassidy proves yet again that she's a vocalist that few (if any) can touch---famous or otherwise. My favorite track is her rendition of The Beatles' ""Yesterday."" The most covered song in pop history and FINALLY SOMEONE GETS IT RIGHT!!! I can't wait for the next collection :-)"
1,There comes a point...,I fear that the predictions are true and that Eva Cassidy's answering machine tape will be released next.
2,"Nice While it Lasted, Poor Service from Citizen","This was a nice watch while it lasted. Then it died soon after the warranty expired (naturally).(The crown/setting knob came out completely, then condensation began to develop, then the watch stopped working altogether.)I liked the watch and thought it was worth repairing via Citizen. But they wanted more than the watch costs new to perform the repairs. Now it sits in a drawer.Citizen apparently makes disposable watches -- when they break, just buy a new one.I've indeed bought a new watch, and it wasn't a Citizen."
5,Great watch!,"I'm a little bit particular about my watches. I like a quality watch with few frills. It should look as if the band and watch flow together. This watch is very comfortable, and so light that I forget that I am wearing a watch. The watch is very high quality, looks great, and the dial glows brightly all night."
4,I dig it but,"It looks and performs just as described. Glow in the dark is good (I prefer an indiglo-type technology though) and the titanium keeps it light. The only thing that I wanted in this watch that is missing is a little more bulk to it. It's got a slim profile that was hard to see by the pics, but if that isn't a preference for you then it's no biggie."
5,beautiful watch,"Bought it for my father as an xmas present, hope he'll like it. It pretty big/massive looking yet its lightweight thanks to being made from titanium. Came in a really nice, big and fancy looking box, a present in itself. The Eco-Drive feature is really nice and it does work. The watch was in its box for who knows how many days and when i opened and started it it worked right away. It was illuminated for maybe 5 minutes before I put it back in its box. Then a couple of hours later I showed it to my wife and noticed that it was keeping time nicely - using energy it could get for 5 min of meager illumination. Nice! :)"
3,Band does not fit small wrist,"Since I have a small wrist, I removed several links enough to cover the circumference of my wrist. But the links are big so they don't bend enough to be put back together.But I didn't like the watch when I saw it in person. I didn't like the shiny chrome-looking parts. I have a Seiko titanium watch that has a brushed metal look. I prefer that instead."
2,"Great design and style, some functionality issues.","The watch obviously looks nice and the links have a nice, unique design. Unfortunately I have had terrible issues with the pins between the links. There are multiple links that wiggle out throughout the day and I have to shimmy them back in all day long. I tried having this issue addressed with a jeweler but it didn't last. This is the kind of issue I would expect from an inferior watch, perhaps one well under 100 bucks."
3,2 1/2 years and crown broke,"This is a great watch. It can take a little while to get the date to change during the overnight hours. I love the band, it's very durable. It scratches easily but I don't care and I'm the kind of person who could care less what anyone else thinks either.I've had this watch for 2 1/2 years and it's been great up until now. February having 28 days, I had to move the date up on March 1. I gently pulled the crown out with my finger nail and the whole thing came right out of the watch. It took me days to decide whether or not to send it to Citizen for repair. I decided to do it. They will call me to let me know how much it's going to cost. I'm not going to do it if it costs more than about $25 since I already have that much invested in shipping the thing to them. I love the Eco Drive and will get another Citizen for that reason. I will not spend $300 however, which is how much this watch cost at the time of purchase."
1,Eco-drive to junk yard,"The watch looked as advertised but didn't work. The date/time setting was wrong when we got the watch. I followed the instructions and set up the date to present to my husband for his b-day two days later. Well, it was right for half a day and next morning it didn't change, my husband set it up again, half a day later it was wrong again. When we tried to set it up, it was not moving. In addition, it really pulled my husband's hair and he had to actually shave his arm. That was weird. It's going back. Citizen -- I am not a citizen anymore!"
4,Low price and good product,For a chance use and by night not this one badly.Nobody walks with magnifying glass seeing that you cover in the hand
4,nice watch,"It is a nice watch easy to read ,the band can pull hair at times. I can make out the time with out my glasses on .It keep time just fine."
2,Try the Band Before You Buy,"The watch itself is very nice; good looking and accurate. The band is terrible, at least for me. It severely pinches and pulls the hair on your wrist. The band is very stiff and inflexible, more like a bangle bracelet than a watch band. The links are also quite wide making it unlikely you will be able to remove the right number of links to get a good fit. On my wrist the band is a bit too big but if you remove one more of these big links it is too tight. I STRONGLY recommend you try this watch band before purchasing."
5,review of Citizen watch BM*120-56e,An excellent watch reasonably priced. very accurate and stands up to hard use. the titanium case is lightweight and looks good
2,Boring!,"I don't know who thought this was a good idea; but, this is downright boring! It's a two way conversation between two guys that goes on and on and get's nowhere. Very misleading. It wouldn't even make a good radio show."
3,Little info,I was really disappointed in this book. There is virtually no guide to adaptive instruction for actual swimming. Coverage of physics of swimming and getting disabled in & out of pool.
4,Good compilation,If you are fond of the Everly's romantic sensitive stuff [like I am] this CD will not disappoint. 16 tracks. Good price.
4,Excellent CD,"Sting's son sounds, well, just like Sting, in an almost eerie way. But this isn't a bad thing at all I found, the CD is moving and the music is a nice break from all of the annoying rap/metal/teeny bopper/pseudo-punk alternative garbage filling the air these days.The lyrics are pop lyrics, simple, in an almost ColdPlay sort of way, but manage to carry themselves nicely despite their cynicism and are the stuff of classic songs and bands from the 70's and 80's.The CD gets a little stale near the end but the majority of the songs are extremely enjoyable, catchy, and carry an edge.The band's youthfulness shows through in their lyrics, but over-all the music is quite mature and advanced, very impressive!I highly recommend this CD even if you're in your 30's like me and enjoyed U2, The Police and are into some of the newer British bands like the Dandy Warhols, Interpol, Doves and some ColdPlay among others."
1,Just Plane Ordinary,"Sorry to disagree with the majority, but I found this CD highly and deeply ho-hum. It has nothing new to say, the musicianship is simplistic, the lyrics unremarkable, and the voice passionless and weak - except for a very few bars when it began to take on strength, then faded again. I never even finished the CD - the first nine songs were more than enough.I know it's a no-no to reference except very obliquely the lead singer's father, but I had great hopes of this band because of that relationship. Without expecting any kind of clone, imitation or tie-in, I tried VERY hard to like these guys, respect their uniqueness, and appreciate what they were doing. I gave them far more time, attention and sympathy than I would have given any other new band that started off so weakly in the very first cut. But unfortunately, unlike the father at a much younger age, the son and his friends seem to have nothing to say that I care to listen to."
2,Confused,Not bad for debut album but these guys have been going for long time they are in late twenties so when compared to bands like Coldplay they fall way short of mark. Heard Fiction Plane live on KCRW other day they were disjointed and vocal very weak. I have a friend in England who has never heard of them I thought they were big over there.
5,I am in love with Fiction Plane..you will be too,"What can I say about this band? These guys define the newest generation of rock. They usher in a sound that can't possibly be categorized and they leave the listener wanting more. I heard they're about to go on tour with Lifehouse and I am panting at the mouth 4 tickets. All of their songs are the best tunes I've heard, but my all time favorite is ""Everything will never be o.k."". The chorus, the lyrics, the guitar chords all tie in perfectly. I think everybody needs to rush out and hook themselves up with this cd. Fiction Plane rocks."
2,Stick with Left Side of the Brain is you like Fictionplane,"I discovered Fictionplane through Pandora and immediately added both albums to my wishlist. This one was the first I received and listened through, mediocre at best. I'd give it 2.5 stars at best. It misses the sense of music composition and groove that ""Left Side of the Brain"" seems to have. The songs are too much of the singer singing shallow, generic ""Here's my messed up life"" lyrics. The music behind the lyrics definitely seems like there's a lot of reach and experimental spirit, but nothing sounds good; it's mismatched and too-often harsh. So far I've liked everything off of ""Left Side"" but only found a track or two on this I'd willingly listen to again."
3,A good start,"I really like the follow up to this album, which I would highly recommend. If you have that one, then this is a good one to grab while you wait for their 3rd album coming out in Sept. The energy on this one is high, and all the songs are good, but unlike many bands, I think they truly shined on their sophmore release. My one disappointment is that I got sent a clean version of the CD. Cigarette is a lot less enjoyable with big brother editing the lyrics."
5,Fiction Plane,I had the chance to see Fiction Plane open for Lifehouse back at the end of April and having never heard of them before their show was awesome kept me more entertained than Lifehouse themselves (not that Lifehouse was bad or anything). Lots of great songs on this album. People may not give credit where it's due just because who Joe's father is but ya know what everyone ahs to start somewhere. They are a great bunch of guys and if anyone who reads this ever has the chance to go see them live gab the chance and go you won't regret it.
3,"Vague description, expensive return","The product description does not tell how really small these are unless you happen to notice the lemon in the background. The funnel opening in the stem is about 1/16 in. in diameter and the mouth of the funnel is about 1 1/2 inch. They were shipped USPS but return is by UPS at twice the price unless I chose ""self return"". Super Saver Discount for shipping was $3.20 but the refund deduction may be more."
4,Great MINI funnels with a smallest beak,"I was looking for a funnel with the smallest beak. Of all that I tried, these have the smallest beak less than 1/8 of an inch in external diameter. The downside is that they are truly tiny. It can probably hold only 10 ML. I wish they made the beak this small with larger reservoir may be 100 ml?If what you need is the smallest width beak, this is probably the best product you can find."
5,Great laughs for anyone with a mother,"A great quote/anecdote book for those who forgot how tough it is to be an adolescent. V. Penn hits all the ridiculous things mothers say to their children and what we think of them. It shows how funny and unprofound are mothers actually are. Penn is a local radio personality in New Haven, CT with just the funniest sense of humor. I would definately recommend this to anyone who was once 15 and had a mother."
3,Unusual But Still Interesting,"This French ""Contacts"" series (I have three) is a rather unusual body of documentary work. Basically you are presented with a series of photographers talking about themselves and their work. On screen you see their images, or contact sheets of their work, but never the artist. The sound is either the translated monologue with the native language in the background or, depending on you language selection (English / French) the actual artist's voice.The visual quality, in terms of design and encoding, is mediocre.This series is interesting to watch once. But try to get a used copy or, better yet, see if you can rent them."
5,Latin for Beginners,My teenage granddaughter loves this book. The illustrations help you remember the vocabulary. Lessons are theme oriented and guide the reader gradually to an understanding of language and culture.
1,There's a reason it's ranked so low,"I heard ""Best Friend in the World"" on the radio and almost died laughing. It's the worst song EVER. Worth a listen for this reason alone."
4,I'm happy with this guitar.,"For the money, I have absolutely no complaints about this guitar. It was well-intonated and set up from the factory, and it stays in tune quite well. I'm using D'Addario 9-42's and love the way it plays and sounds. Not mind-blowing pickups, but they're not noisy and nothing has come loose. Yeah, the nut's cheap thin plastic, but that's an easy upgrade. After it was in the house a few dry winter months I had to file the fret ends a bit too, but you've gotta expect that sort of thing. This is the kind of guitar that a beginner would probably not appreciate, thinking that dollars equal quality, but for somebody who knows better, this axe is a real sleeper. The maple neck is very high quality, tight grained wood, with a comfy and fast profile, and the whole guitar is light. It's my everyday player and I couldn't be happier with it."
5,very nice guitar,I have played many guitars in my day. I own 6 guitars at this time. This telecaster is so easy to play. The neck was set up perfectly right out of box.The finish is flawless. One of my favorite guitars ive ever owned. Would recommend this guitar to anyone.
2,Squier By Fender,"When I recieved my Squier guitar, it arrived damaged in three places so I never really got to play it. I was not happy with the way the guitarwas packaged, it lacked good protection. Otherwise I would have given it a try to see how well it played, but needed to return it. In the meantime I purchased a better Fender Telecaster from the Guitar Center. So I'm not saying that the Squire plays bad or good, just never got a chance to play it myself."
4,Fantastic Instrument,"I've been using this for a week or two and it sounds phenominal. This guitar provides the same sounds as Bruce Springsteen's song ""Glory Days"" and Bon Jovi's ""Have A Nice Day"". The action is nice and low and the string gauge is small too. Fantastic guitar"
4,Great guitar (for the money),"Great guitar, crappy switch.Nice sound, neck and finish.Too bad Guitar Center sold it to me as a new guitar, and it was a used guitar. Should have bought from Amazon dot com.I did buy an Epiphone Les Paul Junior from Amazon, and it's a much better quality guitar, though not as versatile as far as sound goes. It was also 119 dollars, with free shipping and arrived in 2 days!Thanks Amazon!"
5,Beautifully Done!!,"Written by two long time members of the SM community, Consensual Sadomasochism offers a great ""intro"" to consensual power exchange play. The authors display a considerable breadth of knowledge and a wonderfully tolerant and open attitude toward all forms of BDSM play. The book is easy to read and follow and covers SM ""basics,"" including fundamental concepts like safe words, limits, negotiation, and consent. The book contains good, if somewhat limited, descriptions of basic SM play (bondage, spanking, clamps, etc). There is also a good section on finding partners and how to find the SM community, along with a bibliography.The authors did a wonderful job putting this book together."
2,Better publications around on the subject.,"This book is pretty outdated and does not look beyond the ""clinical"" aspects of Leathersex/BDSM. Almost overwhelmed with political correctness, each topic is almost apologetic if it offends and never takes a true stance (for the most part). Some of the few things it takes a stance on are somewhat out of date at this time, or have been shown to be otherwise.Wouldn't recommend it."
5,One of the best,Fantastic cookbook. Beautiful photos and recipes that are stunning.Local foods and people. A must for anyone who enjoys food and life!
1,How are you supposed to mount this?,"The shallow part is nice, but to even get the amount of wire necessary to satisfy code, you've already filled up the box. It won't hold a GFCI. The screw holes not only have a chance of hitting the wire, but have nothing but drywall to support it. At that close to the edge, it just falls apart. T&B/Carlon need a better designed shallow old work box."
2,A good beginning ... but it went down hill,"This was the second Linda Lael Miller book that I have ordered. Lilly and the Major disgusted me so I was hoping for better things from this book.It started well, I really liked Lydia and felt for the situation she had found herself in. Devon was also solid and caring.I also enjoyed Brigham, could really understand the guy being so fiercly protective of his family. But once again Miller ruins a perfectly good story with illtimed sex scenes and a woman who loses her train of thought as soon as her significant fellow starts lifting her skirt.I found the story of Polly and Devon more interesting than that of Brigham, and I hope to somewhere find the story of Charlotte and her sea captain, although having said that I'll probably find the same combination of near rape that seems to be creeping in to most of Miller's work."
2,Just OK,This book was okay. Miller has other titles better than this particular one. Try the Primrose Creek series. Much better!
5,Kindle book,Very good with lots of interesting facts about life-the hardships and day by day living in that era. Wonderful love story with down to earth people
1,What a disapointment,"The beginning started out really good. It went down hill from there. It was a choppy storyline, with parts of other stories and characters that suddenly appear mid-novel. It just wasn't a love story. Now I'm a fan of a lot of romance writers, cheasy plots and all, but the story needs to flow. This one was one of the most disappointing novels I've ever read. I hope it was just this one, as this Linda Miller has been recommended to me by other friends that enjoy romance novels."
4,A Perfect Beginning for Your Remodeling Project!,"If you are looking for a place to begin remodeling your basement or attic this book is an excellent start! I was interested in a reference that would guide me in the best place to spend my limited dollars while simultaneously illustrating what aspects of the project I could do myself. It is not a step-by-step guide for the do-it-yourselfer but gives a good idea of the scope of remodeling and the sequencing of what needs to happen. I refrain from giving the book 5 stars because the photos of completed projects were above and beyond any project I'd be taking on and there was no ""frequently asked question"" section I was hoping for."
1,Dissappointed,"I bought this collector's item which was listed as ""NEW"" and paid over forty dollars for it.When it arrived, the box was completely damaged - ripped in every corner.When I called Amazon customer service I was informed it came from the ""liquidation"" part of the company and a new one could not be issued.There is no where on the amazon website where it indicates liquidation or anything to that effect.Very dissappointing."
5,Great book to help you prepare for the test!,"The exam cram books in general are a great series! I used them to help me study for my MCSE tests. With the help of these books, I passed each test on the first try!So when I was going to go for my Sair Linux certification, I used the Exam Cram book. This book was great and helped me prepare for the test. The book covered the main topics in more depth than the test requires and the practice test was more difficult than the real thing. If you understand the information given to you in this book, you have a good chance of passing the test. You need a 74% or better to pass.the exam. I was surprised to find out I got 92% on my first try, because I am new to Linux (less than 6 months). This book was a major factor in me passing the exam!"
3,not bad but expensive,Look up the reviews on places like Ecoustics and then look at the price!You can find stuff that sounds as good for probably half the cost.
5,Buy THIS TODAY! Read it to your children or grandchildren!,"Wow- This is a great family book that is sure to become an hierloom! A strong charachter building collection of short stories that can be read at bedtime or during family home-evenings! If my children learn just part of what is covered, they will be richer for it!I have even used a couple of these as discussion topics during motivational meeting in the office.It MAKES YOU THINK!Grandma would have wanted you to know all of this!""who you are is more impotant than what you possess"" - page 131"
5,Toe Ring Review,"i gave this ring to my mother for her birthday, and i am pleased to say that she loved it! i picked out this gift for her a couple months before her birthday, and i was anxious to see what it looked like but i couldnt open it to see, because i'd ordered it gift-wrapped. so i ended up seeing it in person for the first time while my mom opened it: i am so happy with this ring, it is super cute. and so far, it hasnt rusted/changed colors in pool water or at the beach. thanks amazon :)"
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED- MORE LIKE A HAPHAZARD GOLF SCRAPBOOK.,"I WAS ANTICIPATING A FORMAT THAT IS MORE ""SHORT STORYISH"" AND ANECDOTE FILLED THAN WHAT MACKENZIE GIVES US. THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN A GLORIFIED SCRAPBOOK THAT HE PUTS TOGETHER WITH VERY LITTLE PASSION. THE BOOK NEVER COMES TO LIFE. A DISAPPOINTMENT."
5,St. Andrew's Golf Course,"I got this for my cousin who is a golf nut. He has been to the old course, so I thought this would be a great gift for Christmas."
1,Blah,"I hated this CD because it was all sound effects and short short short background songs...don't expect anything that wasn't in the movie...the only good part was the main song, which was the only one with lyrics."
5,One of the best,"This C.D. is so great. All the songs are so catchy. All of them are really good. But My favorite was It's love, wich is the only song that has lyrics. It defenitly wouldn't be a waist of your money. Most of the songs are happy but there are a few deppressing ones. That is what gives it its balanc. The its love song is sung in Japanese, But in the iside it is written in English as well as Japanese. You should really buy it. You won't be sorry."
4,TV Soundtrack Nice,"This CD has alot of the background themes of the Ranma 1/2 TV series and if you listen to the backgrounds alot, like I do I suggest buying this CD made just for people like you and me."
5,Great value!,I searched for weeks looking for the best value on this butter dish. Beautiful dish at a great price!
4,Nice Tribute!,"The independent record store I usually order from sent out an email concerning this so I eventually picked it up (the description made the album sound that good). The music sounds very much like Apoptygma Berzerk or VNV Nation meet Dead Or Alive. Because one band has done all the music you might think this could get old in short order. Not so, the music was all performed by one band but there are different vocalists on the tracks. It sounds like they had a handful so you hear the same vocalists a couple of times over the life of the album but it is still a good tribute, especially since no one here is trying to be the next Depeche Mode by auditioning with sound alikes, and that includes the sound of the vocalists; no one attempts to sound like Dave Gahan. Worth checking out."
3,Mixed,"American music worthy of another qualified performance. The violin performance on this album is competent, which from my perspective, the insipid cello performance brings this point into focus. By contrast, the piano performance dutifully stands on middle ground. Dr. Bibel unhelpfully iterates the obvious without ever touching on precisely what qualifies a 'gem'. The producers of this album had good intentions that might have been better served discriminately."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY DO NOT BUY DEFECTIVE PRODUCT!!!,Very disappointed with this product. I received it today 9/15 Open it up pull it out pump it all of 3 or 4 times and down at the base it expanded an then blew out.They way it blew out im assuming its a design flaw that somehow they missed( or didnt care) Also a notable issue is the hand pump itself. it does not work well at all. You have to do light squeezes if you squeeze it hard the pump collapses and then takes a while to un-collapse and fill back up with air. VERY unhappy. I emailed amazon about returning even though there is a no return policy. I am still waiting the response. I highly recommend staying away from this product you will be very unhappy if this is indeed a design issue with judging by the 1 other review who had the same problem it probably is.
1,UNINFLATABLE EMPEROR,RECEIVED PRODUCT. OPENED BOX AND INFLATED IT TO SEE WHAT IT DID. IT MADE A DEFLATING SOUND LIKE A BLOWOUT.IT HAD NOT REACH THE LEVEL ADVERTISED.TRIED TO REINFLATE AND FOUND IT HAD AN AIR LEAK. WOULD NOT REINFLATE.PRODUCT WAS NEVER USED. CHECKED WHERE AIR LEAK HAD OCCURRED. IT WAS IRREPARABLE.COULDN'T IMAGINE SOMEONE ACTUALLY USING IT.COULD NOT RETURN DUE TO RETURN POLICY.VERY DISAPPOINTED. MY WIFE SAID SHE DIDN'T LIKE THE LOOKS OF IT ANYWAY.
2,Not as good as I thought.....,"I thought this was an Ionic flat iron,(indeed it is) but it does not get hot enough (it does not have auto heat you adjust the temp yourself) and does not get your hair as straight as the real ionic products made for professional use. My friend had a different flat iron that works 100% better. This cost too much and it does not do what you want it to do!I was disappointed."
3,Ok Straightener.....,"For a straightener that dries and and also straighten my hair, it's ok. It takes much longer to straighten my hair than with my regular hair straightener by Conair. I do like the curved plates. It makes it versitale to flip in or out the ends of my hair. If you have a lot and thick hair this product might not work very well for you."
1,Waste of money,I've used this product once. I think it's safe to say it was a waste of money. It's rather inconvenient to use on wet hair and also leaves it completely flat.
1,SAVE Youre Money,I think this was a big waste of money im very dissapointed w/the infiniti by Conair. Even when my hair is dry it doesnt work that well.
5,Worth its weight in gold - literally,"This book was given to me by a friend to read, as I was struggling to find angel investors for my new business.In a world that is otherwise foreign to me (the 'money world'), this book made everything clear: not just how to seek capital, but how to think about my business idea in order to realistically turn it into a fully fledged money-making enterprise. This is a clear window into how the seasoned business people deal with business! I could have sunk a load of money into my idea, without taking it in the direction that it needed to go. This book has given me a road map to get to where I want to be, and has probably saved me from financial and emotional distress. 5 stars to the authors. I'm on Amazon now to buy my own copy..."
4,Fact or fiction?,"Fact or fiction? Mr. Ocha will keep you wondering through the entire book, ""Can this really happen""? A much too frightening look into the cold, calculating realm of world domination. Was the fall of communism the real deal or just facade to put the rest of the world at ease? Mr. Ocha is to be commended on his homework & research. I think I'll add him to my list of favorite authors."
2,Almost a Good Analysis,"This book is quite easy to read - even entertaining. The only problem with it is the author's venomous and unmasked hatred of women in general. It is this very hatred that discredits his arguably sound points. This book was almost a great analysis of the consequences and difficulties of having women in the military, but it falls short because of the author's inability to leave his bigoted anti-women opinion on the backburner and deal strictly with the facts. I finished this book both angry and disappointed...and found little to credit the author with except a fine writing style."
1,A slap in the face of our Troops,"Mr. Mitchell clearly has a contempt for women, as human beings and as soldiers. I realize his book was written a while ago, but under President Bush, womens' role in the military has been expanded far beyond anything in the past of the American military. And our female troops are performing admirably in Afghanistan and Iraq. Mr. Mitchell's book is a slap in the face to the women sailors of the USS Cole, and the women who are protecting all of us in the War on Terrorism. It's a disgrace that our brave Troops have to defend themselves from the biased and falsified ""reporting"" of authors who should be seeing a psychiatrist to get to the reasons for their misogyny! One star is really being generous for this worthless junk."
1,Waste of Paper,"Mr Mitchell simply must hate women. His book is a very one sided account of women in the American military. At no time does he mention the accomplishments of the many talented women in the military. I also found the book to be poorly researched. Mr Mitchell mentions that women were the cause of the tradition of West Point Plebes staying at the Academy for Christmas being cancelled. The Plebes in the Class of 1968 were the first to have Christmas at home in 1964-this can be confirmed by reading Gus Lee's novel of West Point or asking a 68 grad. Major Rhonda Cornum if she did receive the DFC etc received it after all crewmates received them. Originally, she only received a Purple Heart and a POW medal. Grow up Mr Mitchell, we all do not want to be barefoot, pregnant and chained to your kitchen sink"
1,"Empty ""facts""","Before I read this I felt I had my mind made up about I felt about women in the military, but I told myself I was reading it from a completely academic standpoint and I would take all of the text in as information and fact. As I read it though, I felt Mitchell has an underlying dislike of women overall and his writing could not be completely taken as accurate. I know for a fact that not all men who oppose the idea of women in the military feel this way but it is evident that Mitchell is a man has a few issues with bias against women."
3,a different slant from what you hear today,certainly tells another side with points well made - recommend one read simply to get an appreciation for other viewpoints
4,Scary but true,"This was by all accounts, an excellent book. I do not feel that Mr. Mitchell is bigoted towards woman at all. I fell that some people my feel that way because Mr.Mitchell so clearly and effectively supports his thesis that woman DO NOT belong in the military. Mr.Mitchell gives several examples, such Kelly Flinn, the boys of Syarcuse, and many others to prove his point that Women in the miliary are fliring with disaster."
4,Great for beginners,I found the book very helpful for those of us who are starting to learn reflexology. It clearly shows which areas of the foot you have to work in order to create well-being in another area of the body. It's a very simple book that you will surely enjoy.
2,Disappointing,"I spent a long time searching for the right log hauler with wheels/tires durable enough to make it across out gravel driveway through the snow and muck in the middle of winter, into our back door to the wood-burning stove withoutmaking a mess in the house. I thought I had found it. The box came punctured with the tubing sticking out, and both tires were flat. AND, assembled, it doesn't fit through our back door. So across the carpet from the front door is the only way we can use. My advise - check the dimensions carefully....I had assumed that a door is a door is a door, and that this would have been made to accomodate any size doorway."
2,"Interesting cars, some bad science.","A very interesting show on automotive technology for the future. Some very good segments on battery, hydrogen, and diesel fuels. There are a few segments that discuss technology that could never exist, in particular is a narration on air powered cars (ep 5). The narrator flat out says that a compressed air driven car could recharge it self and provide perpetual motion. Science shows should be vetted by at least a high school science teacher. Very disappointing for such a otherwise well done show."
3,SHOULD BE SOLD WITH PAPER DRILL,I HAVE NOT USED THE RACK YET BECAUSE MORE THAN 3/4 OF THE CATALOGS WOULD NOT FIT WITH THE STANDARD PUNCHED HOLES. I HAD TO AQUIRE A PAPER DRILL TO MODIFY THE HOLES TO USE.
3,loved it but am now unhappy with quality,I really love this watch. I have received many compliments on it. It is very feminine and feels good on your wrist. Definately would recommend it to others. Updated review--Nov2010--I have had this watch since Apr2010 and went to put it on and there are 2 crystals missing. I have only worn the watch maybe a dozen times--I only use it for good. I am in the process of trying to find where to send it-and if it is covered. I am really upset about it. It is such a pretty watch-but for the price and being a Citizens watch--I would definately expect it to hold up better than it has. I will be changing my review as soon I find out what I am to do and if they will fix it.
5,Very nice watch!,"I bought this watch for my wife on our anniversary and she absolutely loved it! It's beautiful first of all and secondly, it's an Ecodrive so it never needs winding. Got a great deal, so it was also a tremendous value. Very happy with this purchase!"
2,Yow,"This is pretty horrible. I'm giving it 2 stars because there's some good guitar and drumming on it, but the lead vocals are frickin' awful. The screeching lead singer, whoever it is, makes Sweet sound like a bad generic 80s metal band. This is not good. I miss Brian Connolly more than ever after subjecting myself to this nonsense."
2,"Great songs, but too much rawk extravaganza","The songs are classics you love, but this live collection doesn't add anything to them. The four extra tracks, including the awful cover of ""Reach Out (I'll Be There)"" are throwaways.Stick to your copy of ""Desolation Boulevard""."
2,Boring,Kids played with it for a day then lost interest. Very big and requires large space to store.
5,As grand as Bob Vila's hot rod!,"One big tool box. 25 discs worth of content set across eight sets. A tool that may reflect Binford's name (whether that's a good thing I don't know). For any Home Improvement fan, or someone who looks at 90s sitcoms with nostalgic fondness. (Insert Tim Allen grunt here).FYI: If you own all eight seasons to begin with, there is nothing new added to the set. The discs are indeed all previously released material."
5,Home Improvement Set,"Myself and my kids love Home Improvement. We have been enjoying the Discs. I think the case is cute, although that is not why I bought it. Same with the tool that comes with it. Those extras are not important. Good clean family laughter and fun."
5,Perfect Gift,"This is such an excellent television series! Tim Allen at his funniest! This is a great show for the Mr. Fixit in your life! A hilarious, must-have for any family!"
5,great,Home improvement is one of the best shows ever i watch these dvds over and over ppl shud buy this show the whole collection its worth every penny
3,Some good laughs,"When I caught bits of this show on TV, I though Tim Allen was a big jerk. Watching the dvds, I now see that Jill is the jerk... or maybe they deserve each other. That takes away a lot of my enjoyment, but there are a lot of good gags that keep us laughing all the same."
2,This book is bad!,"Enticed by the low cost and combination of two core exams I picked up 'Teach Yourself NT Server 4 in 14 Days'. After reading it through I realised that the book does NOT cover everything you need to know for the exams; policies for example (heavily emphasied in the server exam) are given less than one page. The fact that the two exams are not separated in the text means that you are not entirely sure what you should be focusing on prior to a specific test. I have since seen this book in an earlier (thicker!) edition without the MCSE branding. Comparing the two, this looks as though it was slightly revamped and rushed to market. It shows... My recommendation would be to spend a little more and buy New Riders."
2,Not as Pictured and Described,"I ordered two of these batteries because they were described as Norelco batteries and the picture showed the purple original Norelco battery cells. I was very disappointed when my order came and I found two generic ""made in China"" yellow battery cells. These are NOT the original Norelco batteries. They may be equivalent, but they are not what was described or pictured. The generic yellow Ni-Cd cells from China are readily available on Amazon and other sites. I paid more for these cells because I wanted the OEM Norelco cells."
3,Can You Move On?,"A fluid horror story of a young man's efforts to get out from under the death of his own sister, at his ""hands.""The play leaves no doubt-it's the first line, and on the back of the book that ""Fifteen years ago I killed my sister"" is the central point in this man's life.Though a play, it is written in such a way that one actor could do all the speaking, though a cast list features a sister, mother, father and girlfriend.A short read, it is wondefully written, full of literary nostalgia, and images of sensational pain and wonder.A family destroyed; a sister dead, a mother broken, a father paralyzed and a son shaken. Such a tale comes to good, as the situation and the characters are brought alive in a vivid way."
5,Voltaire must be spinning in his grave,It is of course OK to take the strongest objection to any text and on many grounds but it is surely quite another matter to want to completely silence an author and even call for his living to be suspended. Some of those who go that far should reflect on the wisdom of what they preach. In the post-glasnost era one of the best lessons to take on board is surely the value democratic societies place on freedom of speech. It is obvious that this is proving very hard for many Georgian scholars. When they adopt an offensive and venomous tone they display a fear of rational argument and not a healthy disagreement with someone like Professor Hewitt whose academic credentials and distinction in his field are hard to match.
5,a great book about Abkhazians,"Prof. George Hewitt's knowledge in Abkhazians and Caucasus is enormous, he is a real academician. I am very happy to see this book here and I am strongly willing to get this great book and read it... Everyone should read this book in order to discover Caucasus's mystery..."
5,"A True,accurate and fascinating study on Abkhazian History","The Abkhazians : A Handbook (Peoples of the Caucasus Handbooks) by George B. Hewitt is a book I have read with great pleasure. It has made me see the historical backround of The Abkhazians in a brighter perspective.It is one of the best studies I have ever read about the Caucasus. It is a very fascinating and accurate study, Thanks to George B. Hewitt I feel even more sympathy for the Abkhazians than I already did....Thank you for your efforts and great works....Abziyiraza Haybabayt!Ilkay Nefin Guclu"
4,"Awesome Contribution, but Biased","I see that the reviews for this book are polarized - not surprised. Well, this book is biased in favor of the Abkhazians, for additional info about that you can look up its review in the Academic Journal _Slavic Review_. However, I'm neither Georgian nor Abkhazian, and I'm doing research on the Caucasus for my MA in Russian and East European Studies, and this book is invaluable! If you can mentally offset his bias as you read, which is pretty obvious, by the way, then you will find the information in this volume extremely valuable, especially for being in the English language."
5,It's wonderfull,"This book writes only realities. Read it, and you'll understand much more about Abkhazia and Abkhazians. Although Georgians want this book to be banned, we all know that it is impossible to hide the truth any more."
2,Flimsy,"Adequate size and sturdy enough to sit on, however it is forced apart at the seams by light foam cushions (e.g. sun lounger cushions). The joints need to be much stronger for a box of this kind."
1,Disappointing,Paid more for Rubbermaid but was disappointed. Expected the parts to snap into place but they just fit very loosely together. We had to buy an adhesive to hold everything together! I am pretty handy but thought I was doing something wrong so I had several other folks take a look.
1,Read Reviews Before Buying!,"A great price but that's the only good thing about it! Everytime you open the box the whole thing falls apart, literally! My husband gets mad at me and it't not my fault! But the same thing happens to him so it't not just me! We have it outside our front door apartment to store things we don't have room for but we aren""t putting anything really valuable in it because anyone can pull it apart very easily and take everything in it. I wanted a locking deck box, but what good is a locking box if it just falls apart so easily!! Very, very disappointed in this product! We got this deck box through the' mail and it would be too expensive to return it so we are stuck with it! I only wish that I thought about reading the reviews first!Rubbermaid should come7up with a ""fixing"" solution to send to all of us that got suckered into buying a worthless item."
2,not waterproof,I agree with others. This was the exact size I needed but I had to return it because it was not sturdy. There were cracks in the seams where water could get in. And forget about sitting on it it is way too wobbly.
1,What a Joke!!! NEVER MIND...READ UPDATE BELOW.,I don't even want to waste time talking about this. Rubbermaide should be ashamed to even have its name on this item. Milk crates wrapped with duct tape would be a better option than this. Look below at my update...
5,Great Deck Box .,"Good item, glad I bought this Rubbermaid Large Deck Box. Neat looking, holds a lot of ""stuff"" and keeps it clean and dry no matter how hard it rains. Actually holds two people sitting on it. Needs a cushion for more sitting comfort."
5,wORKS GREAT,i HAVE HAD THIS ALL SUMMER. vERY SIMPLE TO PUT TOGETHER. sO FAR HAS KEPT EVERYTHING VERY DRY INSIDE. iT SEEMS TO BE BUILT WELL FOR WHAT IT IS. i WOULD BUY AGAIN!!!
2,large deck box review,product does not lock together well. solid wall construction but fit and stability is poor. Would not recommend if you need proper locking construction.
4,Does just what I need,"This box goes together easily, holds all my deck cushions, does not allow water into the box and you can sit on the box.If it is put together properly, the box is just fine. Before I bought the box, I read all the reviews and determined that the people having trouble with it falling apart were putting the floor upside down and therefore, nothing was holding together right. My box holds together just fine. I can move it around, no adhesive needed, no sides falling down and the box is sturdy."
3,not as sturdy as you think,"I always thought these were more solid...its actually just locked together, the construction is like lincoln logs. It does the trick, and you can sit on it if you want, but its not a great piece of engineering."
5,great for pool storage,Nice clean lines fit well on pool deck!I recommend this if you want to get rid of clutter on your patio.
5,Little Extra Magnification,"Needed a little extra strength to see numbers on parts, this fit the situation. Plus the light was even better.Fits in the pocket & can have it at all times.Came in a timely manner, plus packaging was great."
4,"Good, but not great","Overall, I enjoyed reading most of the book but at times I did have trouble staying focused. The author includes a great deal of information in the book, but sometimes all the details get a bit monotonous and the book starts to drag for a bit. Instead of roughly 240 pages the book could probably be boiled down into a more succinct 175 pages. Considering the book was not written by a life long author but rather a retired military guy, I give it 4 stars."
1,junk,"I bought a hard cover ""used"" book and paid near full price. The book was bound wrong and missing over 60 pages. The book was obviously known to be flawed and resold anyway. The good news is that the book is poorly written anyway and hardly worth reading. The author simply quotes other writings on all subjects and footnotes them. It reads like an advanced high school research paper. If you like that sort of ""book"" go for it.I think the book is so bad I will not waste my time with Amazon to get a refund or replacement book."
3,Okay over all,"This is alright book, a nice retailing of the origin of the X-men. The fact that part way though Rude is no longer doing the art is a bit disappointing. The writing is good. The page layouts are bad at times. Over all it's an okay book."
3,Vengenance...we have a problem,"While the studio tracks are well produced (and correct) there's one problem with the CD *I* ordered regarding the 'bonus tracks'.What's LISTED on the back sleeve of the CD AND the body of the CD itself is a LIVE version of ""White Throne"". However what's RECORDED is a live version of ""Beheaded"" I wonder if anyone else has this problem? I contacted the record company but they claim nothing can be done and they don't seem to believe me. I'd send the CD back but the last time I checked it's out of stock and I've been waiting a long time to purchased this on CD. ""Human Sacrifice"" was and still is ground breaking! Christian Metal at it's BEST."
4,No complaints; maybe a bit thin,"Seems to work just fine in the few things I've used it for. It's a bit thinner in consistency than I'd hoped, but it does stay in place."
3,NEVER RECEIVED THE ITEM,"I'm writing this review only to let know the seller that I never got the product. I talked to USPS and they say in the system shows it was delivered, and they don't have it, neither I, so I place 3 diferrent orders and yours with another item that was shipped in the same box are missing for a month.I was waiting for this review to contact AMAZON.com or the seller.Thank you in advance.Please could you take care of this matter.Ivan"
5,Cheap and effective!,"I purchased these for working in the yard (mowing, weed whacking, etc.) since they wrap around more than my normal sunglasses. So far they've done a great job keeping stuff out of my eyes. I'll probably purchase another pair with clear glass for construction purposes. I wish they were polarized but for the price that's asking too much.**UPDATE - 6/11/2012**I've had to replace these twice because the arm broke from the pressure of the earmuff-style hearing protection I wear. I replaced the last pair with these http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RKQ1L0/ and they've held up so far. I'm not dropping the number of stars since it could be a combination of my head size and the earmuffs that's causing them to fail."
5,"Lightweight, Comfy, Not too Dark","Had em a little over a week. Used in full sun and in cloudy skies. Not too dark to see what I'm doing when mowing, trimming, rototilling. Haven't tried inside yet. Look nice. Have a slight concern that the coverage around the lower part ofthe eye socket could let something ricochet in, but maybe the cheekbone blocks it. Nice safety glasses, very lightweight, good price."
5,You just have to have it!,"This is a great relase. If you appreciate Mr Feldman's music you just have to have it. Just don't care about negative reviews. The ""historical"" recordings of ""Jackson Pollock"" etc are just great. And the new recordings come in good time too."
4,Great CD...,"This was a great CD, and I enjoyed it very much. Although some pieces were wonderfully vocalized and composed, a few sounded like they were put together in two minutes. I still recommend this CD to Ranma fans, because it isn't very expensive and it's DEFINITELY worth it. n.n Buy away! By the way, my favorite tracks were: Don't make me wild like you, Little Date, So many mem'ries, No Way! Part 2--- Buy this CD!"
5,Buy it you wont be disapointed!,"let me make this straight to the point and with no spoilers! Buy this you wont be disappointed. Every person ( about 25 different people aged form 16-45)that i have had watch this series love it! Every time i buy another chapter of the story i get a waiting list of people wanting to barrow it!. This is one of the best story lines I have ever watched. Laugh , cry, scream, then laugh again.......you will not be disappointed..just buy it!"
4,Fullmetal Alchemist Part 4,"Product arrived on time! That is important to me...I actually bought part I, II, III, this one part 4 and I am pretty sure I bought part 5. It was to be a Christmas present for my son. I do not know much about Fullmetal Alchemist series...but I do know that I did something right when I saw the expression on my son's face when he opened his present. Quality was good...My experience with Amazon has always been excellent.Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Part 4"
5,LOVE this series!,I absolutely adore this series. This season was a good continuation of the last one and i'm glad this is the one that's true to the manga. Absolutely great show!
5,awesome,This is a great series. And it keeps getting better. I like it so much more than the original series. This is a must have for all anime fans!
4,"Great for underwater photography, quality product although overpriced.","Takes great pictures underwater, or even above water with the case on. I almost bought another camera to use just for underwater, but I am glad I got the case instead. A friend had the olympus cameraOlympus Stylus 1030SW 10.1MP Digital Camera with 3.6x Optical Wide Angle Zoom (Black)that is waterproof to 33ft and I had my Lumix taking the same pictures, and mine turned out far better in every situation. Cant say enough about having a higher quality lens, it really made a big difference. I do think the price is far too high for just a case, although it is made very nice."
2,Self Indulgent Navel Gazing by the Author,"I can't believe how disappointed I was in this book.Oddly enough, I thought the focus of the book was going to be about the cemetery - silly me! Frankly, I didn't care about the author and what his motives were (hence the title of my review) and skimmed everything after chapter three."
2,There are NO PICTURES if that is your expectation!,"If you purchase this book expecting pictures of the gravestones you'll be very disappointed. There are only about 6 black and white photos in the entire book, and they're not even that good. The reading is interesting, but keep in mind; NO PICTURES!"
2,Absolute Beginner for sure!,"While .BAT files still have uses, especially if you're still using older technology, Jscripts and VBscripts are a better starting point for absolute beginners now. But what you learn here will not go to waste if you move up. All the examples are on the accompanying CD, so you won't spend a lot of time typing."
4,Passion Flower capsules,I was skeptical when I purchased these but thought why not. All I had to lose was the angry mood I couldn't shake. Being a long time insomniac it didn't help much there but it greatly improved my patience with hubby and even the children. I would recommend this product before you head to a doctor for hormone or other unnatural remedies.
3,"Nice watch, poor quality","I bought this watch as a college graduation present to myself in 2004. I loved the style of this watch, as it is more of a bracelet than a watch. After a few months of normal wear, the face was scratched to where it was hard to read the time. The clasp also broke about a month ago and I (unfortunately) lost the watch while running errands. I liked the fact I never had to replace a battery, although I thought with a name like Citizen, the quality of the watch would have been much better."
2,heart watch,"pretty watch, would like to have the heart engraved. Bracelet style. Comfortable, great watch."
4,Very elegant watch,"This is a great watch. It looks very elegant. I have to say the real watch looks much prettier than the picture (the situation may be completely opposite for some other stuff). Pros are already in the product description. The only complaint I can think about is the chain works like a wrist lace. It's not easy to hook by yourself because you can only use one hand to wear a watch. This is not a big problem for me though. It's water proof, so you don't need to take it off so often."
2,pretty watch....but,"I recieved this watch as a gift for christmas and I wear it every day, so it gets a lot of use. I am a teacher though not a contractor so I am not rough with it. Anyway by the end of january the back of the watch fell off. This is a watch that does not need a battery and yet the back just plopped off. So I had it replaced. By the end of february, the little heart charm fell off when I took off my coat. The face is already scratched up. If you are going to buy this watch, don't do it unless you purchace an extended warantee. In a year I'll at least get a new face for it."
4,Citizen Women's Eco,"I love the watch! It looks very elegant. However, the weight of the heart charm makes the bracelet to move around very often, which it makes it uncomfortable when you are trying to find the time. I had the heart engraved."
3,face scratches easily,"The face became extremely scratched. Didn't take but a couple months of occasional use. Overall it was beautiful, and I liked it. My girl friend loved it. Also another problem was as you wear it the watch face goes face down all the time."
4,Affordable macro and telephoto in one very good lens,"Can't afford to drop a grand or so on that 300mm or macro lens you just gotta have? Sigma to the rescue. This lens, while not top quality, still produces great images when properly used, i.e., on a tripod. On my Nikon D60 it meters just like my Nikkor lenses, and the lack of autofocus is really not important (at least to me) when I am shooting telephoto or closeup. With this lens, my macro shots are sharp where it counts and my long shots are too. Great value for the $$."
4,"Good lens, sharp picture, but it's not nice with body color & material","Good lens, sharp picture, but it's not nice with body color & material (the newest model)."
3,Light hungry,"Reasonably good build and functionality. This lens needs LOTS of light. It's virtually useless indoors. Works well outside on bright days. I like the macro function. If I were to do it again, I probably would not buy this lens. I'm using it on a D70"
5,Best telephoto lens for the price,"You can't go out and spend around $200 for a telephoto lens and expect it to perform like a $700 or $1300 lens, not going to happen. I think for the price range its a great addition, especially with the useful macro capibilities. Sure its not as fast of a focuser as Nikon's AF-S lenses, but it's also about 1/3 the price. The sharpest point for this lens is 70-220 at F/8, but thats not saying that the pictures are otherwsie unusable. As for indoor use, you need a flash. As mentioned before it really is too slow to use indoors (thats what primes are for anyways) but for the price, quality of the image, its a no brainer to pick it up"
5,Storybook Treasury of Dick and Jane,This volume was requested as a gift for our 5 year old granddaughter. It was no disappointment and brought back memories to all adults.
1,"Only useful as a ""nostalgic keepsake""","When I was 4 years old, my mother bought some of these books to try to teach me how to read. By the second book, I was so annoyed by the simplistic and unrealistic repetition and content-empty ""stories"" (in the verbal sense) that I insisted my mother show me how to sound out words in other books that had actual story content. I was reading quite well before I went to kindergarten, but NO thanks to ""Dick and Jane""."
5,excellant begginning reader,"My daughter is in kindergarten this year and this book has been an excellant tool to teach her to read. The ease and speed with which she is able to read whole stories by herself has been a source of great motivation to read more. My wife and i would highly recommend this, and th other Dick and Jane books we purchased as great beggining readers for any child."
5,An incredible SACD,I bought this SACD on the recomendation of a friend and it was truly amazing. I have always loved Ravel's Bolero but the The performance of the orchestra was faithfully reproduced in this title. I cam close my eyes and feel like I am sitting front and center in the room with them. I recommend this to any audiophile.
2,2 stars for historical content ONLY!!!,"This is probably one of the most melodramatic and badly acted films ever. Here is an example of how an otherwise good story can be totally destroyed by poor direction, poor acting, poor editing, poor visual effects, and overall poor quality. This is really too bad because I think this is a story that should be told to the masses about the subjugation of one ethnic minority culture by another self-proclaimed civilized culture in the name of ""freeing"" them of their traditions. If the story being told were not so horribly true I would say this movie is pracically laughable it's so bad. If you want to see a good movie about the Tibetan people/culture I highly recommend ""Himalaya"", but please don't waste your time on this movie. I can't even sell my copy because my conscience won't allow me to... the best I can do is donate to the library."
1,"Poorly acted, directed, Chinese propaganda","Good: Tibetan sceneryBad: pretty much everything else. Acting is over the top or just plain bad. Cinematography and direction (awkward splicing, visible sound booms, etc.) make me question the time frame they had to film and produce this one. Above all it is a barely hidden vehicle for the Chinese government's reaction against their Tibetan policies and history.Avoid unless you want to see an artifact of how the Chinese government uses the arts to promote the ""official line."""
2,unhappy with this,"I took a chance on this. You never know: sometimes things like this can be a real treasure (e.g.:The Travelling Jewish Wedding). But not this one.I'm not qualified to state whether the compositions here -- or the performances -- are ""accurate"" rekindlings of the time and place the CD purports to render. All I can say is that it's not very listening rewarding: I won't be listening to it a second time."
1,stay clear of this cd,"all i know is this cd is wild. i mean, wild. i have purchased many cds over my time, and i recommend that you stay clear of this one. these people are not only satanic, but every song sounds the same. thus, i would suggest that you download one song of napster and claim to have the cd, since you can't tell the differance. these people would better serve society by flipping burgers at mcdonalds. save your money on this one folks"
4,Caliente,"I have a copy of this CD ""Sigue Caliente"" that I got at one of there shows. It's great. It's mordern pop cumbia music, with some slow ballots, very danceable music."
3,Not a First Choice,"Errors in tuning, awkwardness in the double-stops, and a scratchy-scrape timbre much of the time that sounds unnecessarily 'modern' and wire-strung! There's a much more convincing performance on modern violin by Augustin Hadelich, recorded in 2007 and released on bargain-price Naxos."
3,Princess Diana,"I was not impressed with the money I spent, and it was only 50 minutes long. I interviews were good, and I believe she was killed, and it wasn't an accident."
5,Very informative!,"As all the History Channel productions, this episodefocuses on the mystery around princess Diana's death - and in an objective manner, presents several theories for the viewer to ruminate, and draw a conclusion."
5,Poignant and touching!,"E-Mail to the Front is a wonderful honest glimpse into what military life is like for those left behind while their brave spouses help protect our country and freedom. Ms. Holliday touches on daily life, big and little, and all the emotions that come with trying to carry on when a big part of your family is missing. I really enjoyed this touching book and am so glad I read it!"
5,A MUST HAVE FOR ALL NAVY WIVES!,This book was well written and is a book you cant put down until you reach the back cover!It takes every Navy wife or family member right to where the Author was at that point and time.Highly recommended read.Impatiently waiting a sequel..
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This was the book for my book club not too long ago, and I was really looking forward to it. I *thought* it was going to be great. I'm generally a believer in finishing a book once you start it but I finally had to give up on this one about 2/3 of the way through because I was so exasperated with her. My book club is made up mostly of military wives and we all agreed that Mrs. Holiday is so mopey and whiney she makes herself and military wives look like dishrags who can't function without the presence of their husbands. And the emails she sent to him ""I thought you died today"", etc. - I wish she'd have sat for a minute and thought about how that might have made her husband feel, being halfway around the world and all. If I were her, I'd be ashamed to have published some of the things she wrote. I wish someone would have told her to get a grip."
5,Brilliant! Erma Bombeck would have loved this!,"I sat down to read one chapter--just one--and didn't get up until I finished the book! Yes, it's THAT good! I laughed, I cried . . . and I came away with a new perspective on what the life of a military spouse entails. Alesia's honesty and candor are a refreshing change from the sometimes sugar-coated write ups we get in the media and ""chicken-soup"" type books.This is a must-read for co-workers, employers, family and friends of military spouses. The ""top ten"" lists are worth the price alone.Looking for a good read--or a great gift? Look no further!"
3,Not bad for the money I paid for this,"I don't feel this wrench will last long enough, but if you need something here and now - it's a pretty good deal. Overall- you get what you paid for."
2,Watch out for these 2 little screws,"I needed this item for occasional use, so I am not a heavy user at all. I used it a few times and seemed to work well, I had no complain at all and would probably have given a 4 or 5 stars if I had written this review a few weeks before. The tool looks sturdy, come with some calibration certificate, so it looks like someone tested it before packaging, although I have no way to verify that...So I was pleased with it until a few days ago when notice it made a strange noise while trying to use it, like if something was loose in the tool head sometime the tool wouldn't block and thus there was no way to tighten anything. There are 2 little black screws that hold on the blocking mechanism and so at some point they just went off the first thing I knew was that all the parts from the wrench head where lying on the floor (there are 5 or 6 parts). It took me about half an hour to figure out how to put them back so the tool would work again."
4,Just what I needed torque wrench,"Great price , shipped on time ,Just what I needed to get the job done"
2,Be Careful!,"Bought this object a few months ago. First, the company mailed me the wrong torque wrench. I had them refund me the difference instead of shipping me the proper wrench. Then, when I used the wrench for the first time, the adapter broke. I did not exceed the max. torque of the wrench since I was using it to loosen a bolt torqued at 150 ft-lbs. The adapter was a knock-off because the replacement adapter I brought looked similar but was made of a better quality metal.Overall, do not buy this wrench. Spend the money on a better quality wrench."
4,It Works,"No complaints, installation in my Lenovo S-10e was easy if a little fiddly. I upgraded to the max RAM load for a very low price. Recommended."
5,Error in Amazon's technical specifications listing.,"Amazon's ""Technical Details"" for this part say that this SODIMM is a DDR2 PC2-6400 part. If you check the Crucial website, it's really a DDR2 PC2-5300 part. I can use either so I didn't really care but when the part arrived I verified that the Crucial specifications are correct and the Amazon specification is wrong."
1,Memory Upgrade for Asus1005PE,"I purchased this as part of the package Amazon was offering. This memory card is not for this model! I am still trying to recover my pc as I have BIOS errors. Been trying to autocorrect my system for a couple hours now, with no luck.Nothing like purchasing a netbook that no longer works. Don't be a sucker like me - and research if the memory card is compatible with the pc before install."
5,RAM is RAM,The purchase and delivery was easy. I got the RAM in the time estimated at a great rate. I will do this again when I need more RAM. Good value for money.
5,Works great on my Dell Mini 9,"This maxed out the RAM in my Dell Mini 9. It was a cheap, fast, and easy upgrade for my netbook."
3,Wrong Memory Chips???,"Apparently, this was the wrong chip set. Check out the Crucial site. They list a different, faster chip set. Mine works but could have been faster."
5,It's RAM. It works.,I bought this to update the RAM in my Fujitsu Stylistic 5112. I found it worked fine next to the existing 1Gb chip bringing total memory up to 3Gb. The computer is quicker and more responsive now. I'm running Linux Mint.
5,awesome,I needed this to upgrade my mac so that I could upgrade my mac a second time so that I could install my quickbooks upgrade. I got exactly what I asked for in a timely manner.
4,On a Toshiba A215,It works very well you can put 4GB to your toshiba without care je je je!!! because it work fine...
4,very good speed,"I have been using this memory in my notebook about two months now, so far it is working great, I am seeing significant improvement."
5,Well worth the money!!,"This is such a great buy. I bought one of these to upgrade the RAM in my newly purchased Lenovo S10e. Item arrived safely and installation was a snap. I was so happy with this item that I ordered another for my IBM/Lenovo Thinkpad T60. As for the brand, I was told by my friend that Crucial is the best for RAM.I can't believe how long I have been using a laptop with only 512MB of RAM when this upgrade is so simple and cheap!"
2,Disapointed with Amazone suggestion to get extra 2g memory,I bought the Asus Eee PC 1005PE a month ago and it was suggested to get a Crucial 2GB 256M 64PC2-5300 CT25664AC667 DDr2 200 pin Sodimm memory. Well that memory didn't make any difference but it gave me trouble when turning it off as it would reboot or just wouldn't turn off. I didn't notice any better performance and I am back now to the original 1 GB memory. I noticed that this is still being suggested??? Can something be done about this?
3,If at first you don't succeed...,"Ordered this to upgrade myGateway LT2119u 10.1-Inch Black Netbookfrom 1GB to 2GB. The first card I received was bad - computer would not even start as it only had the one card. Submitted a replacement request with amazon who were very quick about getting it out to me with 1 day shipping. Installed the second and it runs great and without problems. Just be aware when ordering this product it may take more than one go, but that is true for most RAM so it shouldn't come as any surprise."
3,easy install,"I bought this 2 MB memory module for the Asus Eee PC1000HE netbook. It appeared to be a highly recommended upgrade for performance, and was very easy to install. I'm not sure it dramatically improved performance, however. Everything works fine, but no speed records."
5,Good ram works well in lenovo thinkpad t60,"Went on the crucial website and they recommended this ram after using their scanner. So far their site has yet to give me a wrong part for my computer and it has always worked very well in my computers. If you do not have much memory (1GB or less these days) and this ram fits in your laptop you should definitely get it because it sped up my computer slightly, led to a lot less crashing in my programs, and is probably the cheapest well known brand (kingston was cheaper by a dollar or 2 but I have yet to be steered wrong by crucial and wanted to play it safe)."
2,Not the correct part for Acer Aspire One AOD 255,"This is not the correct part for the Acer Aspire One AOD255 netbook. Also there is no directions for inserting the part. I followed detailed online directions for the AOD255 to replace the RAM and found that this is the wrong part. I thought maybe I did not know what I was doing so took the netbook to a local computer company and was assured this was the wrong part. Unfortunately, by that time, the packaging was destroyed so I could not return it for credit. I am sure it would be a great part for the correct model netbook, but the Acer Aspire AOD255 is not it."
5,So much for so little,"Short money to double the memory capacity of your netbook, or to add to your notebook/laptop. Goes in quickly and easily. No configuration necessary. Just be careful of static and handle without touching the contacts when installing."
4,performs as advertized,The 2 gigs of ram has definitely enhanced the speed and performance for my snappy Toshiba nb205 netbook. Installation was a breeze.
4,works as expected,I got an old computer with an old processor AMD Turion 1.9 GHz. The additional memory really did not make my computer much faster but I can see imporvements in other areas.Can't complaint about the product since the processor is old. but it was worth the try.
4,No Problems,"There is not much to say, the item shipped quickly, was shipped accurately which was appreciated. It was easy to install (about 5 minutes most of which was opening the plastic enclosure) and works fine."
1,Wrong Memory,"Be careful if you purchase this item for use with the Acer Aspire One- it will not work, and you void your warantee when you open the case to install it.I have communicated to Amazon that it is not the correct RAM upgrad for the Acer Aspire- but for some reson they continue to list it as an item that people purchase with the AspireOne."
1,Not Suitable for ASUS 1000HE,"According to Crucial, this product (CT25664AC667) is NOT compatible with the ASUS 1000HE. Crucial recommends - and guarantees - CT 934346 which is Amazon's CT25664AC800."
1,Amazon Misleading buyer,"I recently ordered an ASUS Eee Top touch screen PC, and Amazon recommend to buy 2GB Memory for upgrade purpose. I did bought the memory, but when I received the PC, there is no instruction how to open the back cover. I called ASUS to get instruction to open the back cover. They told me the cover can not be opened and asked me to call Amazon get instruction to upgrade memory card. ASUS never suggested customer to do so."
1,Wrong Memory for NC10 (Samsung),"I ordered this Memory upgrade for my new Samsung NC10... because Amazon.com said that is what I needed... WRONG!I have contacted Crucial and Samsung directly and they say that I need Crucial 2GB CT25664AC800 200-pin SODIMM DDR2 PC2-6400 Memory Module (Crucial part #909595).Luckily, I had not installed the wrong one in my new netbook and will be returning to Amazon for the correct one. My mistake for not checking with Crucial and Samsung before I purchased said item.Buyer Beware!"
1,Asus Netbook won't recognize additional memory,"While the Asus Netbook works fine, it will still only recognize 1 MG of the ram, rather than the 2. There is a customer service nuber for Crucial, but they are impossible to reach and I got tired of sitting on hold. The memory was easy to install, but what's the point??"
3,Be careful with the right SODIMM for your NetBook,"Just be careful and double check the type of SODIMM your netbook can mounts.I've bought this Crucial 200-pin 5300 but it doesn't fit my Acer Aspire One 533.I'll try this one instead, it should works fine:Crucial CT25664BC1067 2 GB 204-PIN PC3-8500 SODIMM DDR3 Memory ModuleSo, basically I just gave 3 stars as I'm not able to rate this product."
5,How to install,"I know almost nothing about computers and was kind of scared because I love my new computer and didn't want to kill it. This is what you do because there are a few opinions and I had a hard time because I didn't know what to do at first. Once you do it is as easy as pie. TAKE OUT THE BATTERY. Next, take off the one screw. (I have an AsusEEE). Take out the old (go easy on the clips but it will come out with a little fooling around). Then put in your new ram with the sticker up. THE IMPORTANT thing is that it goes in on a 45degree angle and then you push down. You will feel it slip in as you push it in on the angle. If you try (as I did) to put it in straight it will just be loose in there. It will click into place. Then put back on the cover. Now people say to press f2. It is not necessary but you do it to see if the computer recognizes the 2gb. You can do this if you want. On the screen it will say that your system has 2000 mb or a little more. Good, that is equal to 2gb. Your done."
2,Not Compatible,"This part is not totally compatible with the ASUS 1005pe, eventhough it was claimed as being so by Amazon. When you try to shut down the computer, it will not shut down 75% of the time unless you shut down in high performance or super high performance mode."
3,Does NOT WORK WITH Acer Aspire One AOA150-102,"I purchased this with the Acer Aspire One AOA150-102, because it was a package deal. I thought since it was shown with the computer it would work with the computer. The computer will not boot with this memory in the slot. Please remove this as a package option as it does not work with the Aspire. The memory I am sure is great, however it will not work with this computer and should not be sold with it."
5,Works with late 2007 IMAC,Works well with my IMAC. I tried some ram that had a bus speed of 800 but my IMAC would not boot up had to return it and I got this. It booted up and now my computer has more power. Good product.
5,Works with Acer Netbook,"I bought this as an upgrade to my Acer AOD250-1584 netbook. Installation was a piece of cake and it really took the netbook from being adequate to great, IMO. It handles as many open windows and streaming videos as I can throw at it. I have not had any problems. Very satisfied."
4,Easy to install,"Bought this to boost speed on my HP Mini 110. It was so easy to install and there is a differnece in speed. Although not quite as much as some reviews may lead you to believe, at least not with my netbook. Works perfectly on my HP Mini and nothing to do after it's installed. I didn't have to go into BIOS or anything. Nice price too!"
4,Notebook added memory,"I started a project to scan family photos using my notebook and the memory that came with it made the task a bit slow. After upgrading the memory the work is much faster, so it has saved me time and has made the project that much more enjoyable."
4,Meh,"It's a decent stick of ram that does what it's told. It gets pretty hot in my HP Mini 1030nr, but has no serious problems. I haven't noticed any difference in battery life. My computer is much faster now and I've seen a great performance improvement. It had a pretty swell price tag for 2 gigs."
4,For Netbook,"I had purchased a Gateway Netbook for Windows basically. I own a Chevy SS and needed tuning for my cars modifications. Since HPTuners isn't compatible with Mac, I needed this little guy to do the work for me.Needless to say it gets the job done and this extra stick of RAM makes life a little more bare-able.Maybe I'll get a Surface Pro and ditch the Netbook, but a large part of me thinks this will be unlikely"
5,Remember to press F2 to reboot your BIOS!,"As it has been stated and in case you miss it: When upgrading RAM make sure to refresh your BIOS by hitting F2 until you enter into the BIOS. You should see that the system is now reading all of your RAM and then hit F10 to save changes even though you did not really make any in the BIOS. This allows the computer to now ""see"" your upgraded RAM. Otherwise your computer might only see the original amount of RAM.Other than that, this memory is excellent and so is Crucial's website. It has a tool for checking out your memory on any computer and telling you what kind you need to buy and how much you can upgrade it. Check it out on the company's website."
4,Works for 1005HA,"The RAM module works flawlessly with the Asus eeePC 1005HA-P.However, to my surprise, when I opened the RAM slot, I found that the computer came with PC2-6400 (800Mhz) RAM, not 667Mhz (which is what this module is). The FSB of the computer is only 667, but I would like to match what the manufacturer bundled with the computer (especially since the computer is software overclockable). So 4 stars for Amazon recommending to me slower RAM than what was stock."
4,Compatiable with Lenovo s10-3t,i purchased my Lenovo s10-3t from amazon and also ordered 2GB ram to upgrade my tablet. It was very easy to change the RAM (checkout video on youtube). This has worked well for my Lenovo. No problem till date of writing the review (using for more than 1 month)
3,"Good part, not what I wanted for the EEE PC MT101","I have no problem with this part, but it was recommended by Amazon with the US version of the EEE PC MT101. The US version of the EEE PC MT101 has a cheaper motherboard and only accepts a 1GB part in the memory expansion. This was a reasonable mistake on Amazon's part because users and (presumably) Amazon believed this to be similar to the far superior European version.This part will work fine for any netbook which can accept a 2GB DDR2 200-pin SODIMM laptop-format memory."
2,Bad within a couple of days,"The memory chip died within a couple of days of being installed in my HP 1151NR mini. It read the memory and seemed to load programs and work quicker the first day. But like most memory chips, they die fast or work forever. This was a bad stick."
5,It works! what more it there to say?,"I plugged it in, changed the setup to recognize the extra memory, and it works!I have had it in a few month and it has not died yet.What else is there to say?"
1,Just to warn people who wants to upgrade their netbook!,"Does the upgrade from 1GB to 2GB really help in multitasking? I don't think so! When I open Google Chrome, MSN, thunder(a chinese downloading software) and some other applications in the background, the RAM usage never go beyond 1 GB, but the CPU(Intel Atom N270) is just the weak one that slows all things down. When I try to do the same thing on my old notebook (Celeron M1.73Ghz, 1GB RAM, Intel GMA950), the performance is much better. So the multitasking performance never depends on the memory only, but on CPU, even if you have the strongest Corsair DDR3 4GB memory, it does not make any difference, because the CPU just sucks! And the graphic performance is also no match to my old notebook even they have the same graphic cards. Well, the netbook is not for much multitasking or gaming, this memory is useless per se. I don't recommend you buy it. It only improves your performance psychologically. Understand?"
1,NOT WORK for 900HD/XP,It is not working with my EEE PC 900HD/XP. Do not buy this RAM for EEEPC 900HD model.
4,Cheap upgrade!,Upgraded my HP Mini 1000 to 2gb with this. Improvements in Windows XP were noticeable. Itunes was especially happy since its such a RAM hog. Easy way to help boost your netbook performance..
5,Great Product - Easy to install,Bought this product to upgrade my ASUS Netbook - easy to install and works very well
5,Works Great With 1005HA,"It's RAM. What else can you say? It works in most netbooks. I confirm it working in 1005HA. On netbooks running Windows 7, there is a noticeable difference. Go for it!"
5,Crucial 2GB RAM,"Crucial is a relible brand name. Its memory, not to exciting, it works. What else can I say."
5,Works perfectly with Black MacBook!,Just got the memory in the mail and installed in my Black MacBook. Swapped out existing 2 - 1GB sticks with the 2 new 2GB sticks (4GB total) and I'm flying. It's the same memory offered on Crucial's website but a better deal via Amazon ($[...] per stick when I bought it). Couldn't be happier with the purchase!
2,Not worth it,This piece of memory does not cause an obvious change in the speed of my system. It is not worth it. Now I have an idle piece of 1GB memory (which worked pretty much the same as the 2GB chip) and I'm $50 poorer.
2,Bought this for ASUS 1005PE and isn't working properly,"Title says it all, installed this in my 1005 PE and now computer frequently hangs when shutting down and fails to go to sleep. Still investigating issue, but buyer beware for now."
5,Works in my EEE PC Seashell 1005 Netbook,"Just upgraded my Asus EEE PC Seashell HA1005 netbook without a problem. Opened the door on the bottom of the unit, removed the original memory, inserted the new 2 gig card. Turned on netbook and it recognized the new memory without any problems."
3,A new low in owner-injuring packaging,"I've struggled with lots of packages that resist opening; this one seems to take the art of packaging that injures its owner to new depths.The module worked as expected, once I got it open, but there is no excuse for packaging this dangerous."
5,Fine in my Asus Eee PC 1005HA,Product worked fine in my Asus Eee PC 1005HA. Good brand that worked the first try at a good price. What more can I ask?
4,Good memory for a netbook,I purchased this memory to speed up my daughters Acer Aspire One netbook. It doubled the amount of RAM and the speed difference was noticeable.
5,Inexpensive Upgrade for Samsung NC10,"I purchased this product to double the RAM in my mom's aging Samsung NC10 netbook. This particular netbook model can only recognize and address a maximum of 2GB of RAM, so this was the best option for an upgrade.It went in with no problem and worked flawlessly. Though this machine is quite old now, the extra RAM has significantly reduced the amount of lag encountered when doing simple tasks like browsing the web. I found that, with Windows 7 and a handful of Chrome tabs open, the system's RAM consumption typically hovers around 1.1-1.2GB. Before, this would have meant constantly reading and writing the much-slower pagefile on the hard drive when there was insufficient physical RAM. With 2GB of physical RAM, this is no longer an issue."
5,It made my Acer Aspire One Fly,"Short and sweet...Bought it with my Acer Aspire One to double the OEM RAM.Made a world of difference!Ease of installation depends on the computer manufacturer's instructions and engineering, it upped the speed of a netbook that is used in place of a fully configured audio/video production tower.Packaging of the product is in that darned annoying thick blister plastic which is almost impossible to open without scissors and leaves sharp edges. Have a few band-aids available.Looking to put some zip into your netbook/laptop?Buy this!"
1,Don't order this if you bought a Samsung NC10-14GB Netbook,"Ordered this laptop memory based on the Amazon ad which stated if you bought the Samsung Netbook you should buy this memory and a carrying case for the netbook. Have had nothing but problems for the past month ++. (Screen completely goes black) Been on the phone with Samsung tech support and crucial tech support for days. Finally found out we had the wrong memory card. Sent back to Amazon, don't know what they will do for us."
5,Worth every $,"It was easy to install, no problems at all, now my computer runs faster and that makes a happy me!"
5,"it works, but my computer still running slowly",My computer is too old to update. It is works. Consider update or get a new one before you adding a memory.
5,Perfect!,"I have a MacBook Pro 15"" 2.16 GHz Core 2 Duo from late 2006. After updating my operating system, my computer slowed down quite a bit. Took it in to the Genius Bar and they suggested that I add some memory to it, and specifically suggested the Crucial brand. So for under $30, I went from 1GB of RAM to 3GB of RAM. Installing it was easy - after I located a #00 screwdriver to remove the casing, I popped this sucker in, booted up, and was all set. Computer is flying now!"
5,Does what it's supposed to,I upgraded my late-2007/early-2008 model MacBook Pro with 2 of these (went from 2 to 4 gb). They fit my MacBook and work fine.
5,No Problem in my Asus Eeee1000HE,"The delivery was quick and the product in good shape. I opened the memory cover door, removed the 1 GB stick and the 2 GB stick dropped right in. You do need to go to the settings at boot up and make sure you are set at 2 GB, then save the new settings. Once this is accomplished the Asus recognized the new memory. Took longer getting the memory stick out of the package than to actually change out."
5,Strategic partner,"If you own a netbook, you must upgrade the memory.Turns it into a faster machine, improving your results."
2,Didn't work,I got this to upgrade the RAM on my Gateway LT2108U from 1GB to 2GB. It didn't work and the laptop now doesn't boot up.
5,"Great brand, great product","I bought this for my Samsung NC-10 netbook. It fits and works. I can now multi-task to my heart's content, and laugh in the face of danger with confidence."
5,Easy to Install,Easy to install and works like a charm in my wife's Asus 1005ha. Great price on Amazon and free shipping all the way to Hawaii!
1,Not for the faint hearted,"When I purchased my Asus eee PC 1008HA, Amazon showed that customers who bought that particular netbook also bought this additional RAM memory. Don't - big mistake.At first I couldn't figure out how to open the PC case. Finally I found a demo/instruction on YouTube;, however, you practically have to disassemble the PC to install the memory card.My advice, the PC is plenty fast as is for its intended use -- don't risk tearing it up by installing the extra memory."
3,Compatible Issue,"I bought two 2G memory sticks for my laptop upgration. I got them very quickly. After I installed in my laptop, I found the mainboard in my laptop can only recognice about 3G. So the product is good, but you need to figure out if yhe platform is compatible."
1,NOT WORKING,"I bought this memory for the Acer Aspire 5100 but is not working. I installed it, but not working at all. I can't make it work though. What am I doing wrong? Is this the wrong RAM memory I bought ?"
1,Crucial 2GB 256Mx64PC2-5300 CT25664AC667 DDR2 200-Pin SODIMM Laptop Memory,"I purchased the 2GB memory upgrade as suggested, when I purchased my HP210 notebook. I have tried several times to install it, however without success. All I get is a blank screen when I turn the notebook on. I am very pleased with the notebook, but don't know what to say about the memory card as it does not work.Crucial 2GB 256Mx64PC2-5300 CT25664AC667 DDR2 200-Pin SODIMM Laptop Memory"
2,disappointed,My order arrived in due time.However it ran a size small...too expensive to ship back and then repay for their shipping. :(
4,Excellent product - pricey shipping,There is no better cleaner out there for cleaning soft contact lenses. This came in good time and as described. Just thought that considering its size/weight that shipping was a little high.
5,Miraflow Extra-Strength,I've been using this product for years and wouldn't switch or use anything else. Keeps my contacts clean and fresh for over a year plus. It's great.
1,Terrible Shipping Policy,"This company charged me more than SIX dollars to ship this product to me! I wrote the company before the product shipped to explore alternative shipping and THEY NEVER ANSWERED my e-mail. I would not order from this company again. PS - the product, itself, is fine."
5,Best Cleaner for my soft 3-month lenses,"I've been using the Miraflow cleaner with the AOSEPT/little containerdisc cleaning system for my contact lenese cleaning since 1988.However, it seems I can only buy Miraflow from the online stores like [...] for the past 3-4 years. Now, not having Miraflow in the bathrroom kit when travelling is just like forgetting a passport/drivers license when going to the airport. Simply just turn around and go back home to get them since they can not be bought at a regular drugstore like CVS or Walgreens anymore or even Target or Wal-Mart."
3,Crystal Holiday Glasses,Two of the glasses were broken when I opened up the box. Overall the glasses were beautiful.
5,Fav,These are the only bottles my daughter will take at daycare. She loves them! We tried lots if others but these truly mimic the breast.
3,My son never liked these.,"I tried these because I was pumping milk, but my son was not a big fan. We did just a good with the basic nuk bottle and it was cheaper."
5,Best bottles,These are the best bottles ever. Tried 7 bottles before I tried these. Didn't think my son was ever going to latch on a bottle. These were a life saver!
5,Breastflow Bottles,I love these bottles for my new baby and this is the send time I am purchasing. They are durable and were bought at a reasonable price.
1,waste of money,"I got these when I was pregnant with my son. I've given him this bottle a few times and every time the milk just dribbles down his chin. He definitely gets more on him than in him. Furthermore, the two-part nipple is difficult to clean, and the wide necked bottle doesn't fit my breast pump, so I have to use a conventional bottle and then pour it into the breastflow one. It's a lot of hassle so my son can cover himself in milk. I paid $14 for a set of three and they don't do me much good. In contrast, someone gave me some angled bottles from playtex and my son hasn't had any problems - no nipple confusion or anything - with them.It's kind of disappointing."
2,Beware,"We started using this bottle for my 5 week old son because we have to supplement him with formula. He's only been using it for about a week and now he doesn't want anything to do with nursing, he screams and pulls away until I give him the bottle. I'm pretty sure it's because the nipple on the bottle is faster than I am and he is impatient. Also although it is a good design idea, the outer nipple is soft so it constantly collapses and I have to pull it out of his mouth until it pops back up, which makes him scream again. Now I have to find something that will help with getting the nursing back on track."
5,Great Place to Get a Taste,"This collection focuses on the very early Taj Mahal and contains most of his early classics. For anyone not familiar with this artist this is a great place to start. You get a full taste of ""Taj Mahal"", ""The Natch'l Blues"" and ""The Real Thing""(with the tuba band), his first 3 excellent albums, and it is obvious from these how eclectic a blues performer he is. Taj Mahal has always been one of my favorites, and he presented one of the best live shows I have ever seen. He is touring this summer so check him out if you get a chance, and delve deeply into the rest of his recorded material, particularly ""Senor Blues""."
5,Truely a step back in time,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I found it very hard to put down, and the story telling was amazing. It was also a turn on to me since I am from Hillsborough. I absolutely loved reading this book and then be able to go into town and see exactly where things were. Truely a step back in time for me."
2,Warning,"The film included here is not the classic ""Scarecrow,"" with Al Pacino and Gene Hackman, but the horror movie ""Scarecrows."""
3,Don't remember,Don't remember this item. Must have installed it into someone else's computer some time in the past few years. I don't have it in any of my own computers.
1,Radeon is junk,I've had 2 Radeon video cards and both of them have had the cooling fan break-of course after the warranty expired. it is impossible to replace the fan so the only option is to blow hundreds of dollars on a new card.if you want to buy a new video card every 2 years then go with Radeon.I'm going with Nvidia...
4,Great for the price,"I bought this card to use temporarily with my new pc. I'm fixing to upgrade cards. I just wanted to say that I can run Half Life 2 at full specs with now slowdown and Doom 3 on 1024x768 resolution on high settings. If you buy this card make sure to download the Ati tool for overclocking it, when this card is overclocked it runs even better. http://www.techpowerup.com/atitool/"
1,ATi Radeon 9550 256MB AGP 8X,"I bought one of these cards at Christmas and my wife bought the 9550XL they look just alike and both are a terrible card for the money we paid. She paid $100.00 at Newegg and I bought mine at zipzzoomfly for $89.99 we both paid to much for these cards. I just upgraded last month to a new Nvidia 6200A. I paid less for the card and it outperforms it in everyway. I would never buy another of these even if all I did was surf the web. They run hot a cause lockups and ATi when I talked with them said they were aware of the problem and recommended a fan. Why did'nt they put one on I asked, and they said it was due to cost. There technical support is the worst I have ever seen. As for gaming my daughter runs a 64MB 4X SIS 315 made by Elite group and it smokes this card. I know this because I used Aquamark to bench test it. Pay less and buy a Nvidia card with a factory fan and be happy. I am ordering another one of the Nvidia 6200A's for my wife."
5,"RADEON 9550, 256mb AGP used for CAD","I built my own computer system with an AMD64 3500+ and decided to use this card for general computer programs: Word, Excel, Stats, Internet, and specifically for CAD and FEA programs. This cards work great with the following software AutoCad 2000Lt, Algor, Solid Works, and Alibre. Images (shaded) rotate without jitter and stay shaded with detail. This is great card for the price."
5,Speedminton for the family,"I purchased speedminton on the advice of a friend. I hadn't played badminton since I was a kid, but after watching the video on the Speedminton website, I was sold! And, it is as fun as it shows. My family brings it in the handy case to events, picnics, waiting for the drive-in, just hanging out at home. Great fun, and helps increase hand/eye coordination."
4,great fun,"I bought a set for each of my grown kids. We tried it out on Christmas Day. It was easy to set up and start using. My daughter wanted to buy more sets for the club she works for, it was that much fun."
3,Not much different than badminton,"Speedminton claims to be a twist on regular badminton, yet it is really the same game without a net. We played on the beach, which we could have done with normal badminton equipment. In fact, the birdies that are supposedly made for different conditions did not perform well in the breeze coming off the ocean. We used the heaviest one and added the 'wind ring' provided, yet had to constantly hit out towards the ocean so it would swerve and actually go near the other person. (Kids had zero patience for that.) A REAL badminton birdie, with more weight, would have worked much better. The set is functional, but nothing groundbreaking or new. Though packaged nicely for travel, it's probably overpriced for a hyped-up badminton set."
4,couch potato cured,"I haven't personally seen this product because it was sent as a gift to my 10-year-old grandson. He is an only child raised by his mother, a full-time college student. Outdoor active play is almost non-existant for the two together. However, this actually got them playing and BOTH really enjoyed it. My daughter went so far as to say she'd enjoy more of it. They plan to bring the game along when they visit this summer. I did not rate this the full five because I have not personally tried it....YET."
3,It's ok but not something I'd look forward to playing,"I played this at a friend's home at an afternoon get together. About the most I can say for it is that ""it's something to do"", on par with playing horseshoes. If I had my choice I'd much prefer to play tennis, racketball or even badminton. That said, Speedminton has the advantage of being easy to set up since you don't need a net and can use the cones provided to make your own court. But if you have any wind whatsoever the game quickly becomes unplayable (the weight ring is virtually useless). The birdies (speeders) don't last long especially if you don't hit them exactly square on the top (similar to badminton birdies). Overall, not something I'd look forward to playing as a sport, though I could tolerate it at a windless picnic."
4,"Good Fun, Birdies fall apart.","We opened the set and started out great, But in one Afternoon all of the Birdies or ""Speeders"" fell apart. I have emailed the manufacturer and hopefuly they will come up with a tougher design."
2,Fun set but not that durable.,"I bought this set to play with my nephews but it didn't last very long. The very first time I played with it, the 'Speedracquet' I was using broke after about 1 hour. Apparently, I hit it so hard the birdie stuck in the racquet. It was still fun to use and the birdies really flight high. In my opinion, it would be cheaper just to buy the birdies and use tennis or racquetball rackets that you already have."
3,not appropriate for kids,didn't realize that the shuttlecocks are smaller than 'normal' and the rackets are a tad on the heavy side. was disappointed that it doesn't suit the kids...
5,"Fun, even for the older set","Tried the set out with my 10-year-old nephew today after being frustrated by badminton. Playing was so much fun that we kept at it even after this boomer body was screaming to quit. Really like the fact that no net is required, meaning it will get used a lot more. Materials all seem to be excellent quality, too - overall an excellent value for the price."
5,Fun! Fun!! Fun!!!!,This is an amazing sport. Very easy to play and addictive. I got a friend to try it in my backyard and we both got addicted. Playing in a Tennis court is even more fun as you don't have to stop every few minutes to pick up the tennis balls (for those of us who can't afford ball boys/girls!). Playing with the nightspeeders (using glow-in-the-dark light) is a lot of fun. Try it and you won't be disappointed.
4,A great translation of the original soundtrack!,"If you are looking to relive some of your greatest Resident Evil memories, then look no further than this compilation of music from one of the greatest games ever made. The remix is every bit as scary as the original, and even better in some respects. It retains the nostalgia, while adding a very professional orchestral quality to it. Highly recommended!"
5,RESIDENT EVIL IS THE BEST,Resident Evil soundtrack is like the game....only the best. Its scary and fun to listen to. You have got to have this for your music collection. I say the Resident Evil Sountrack ghishs all other game soundtracks.
2,"Doesn't rock, doesn't roll, just sits there....","I usually have good things to say about Quickband's productions (such as the Short DVD series), but all that can be said for this entry in the [i]Circuit[/i] series is that it does nothing much of anything. Sure, the Cracker/Camper Van Beethoven combo performance is fun, and the live clip of Air is interesting in a throw-back-to-prog way, but the remainder is distinctly lackluster, right down to the now-boring main menu design. There is a fair bit of content on the disc, but hardly any that's worth a second visit."
2,"Technically works, but not in the way you'd like","This was an expensive unit (I paid about $50) compared with others, but I went with it because of the reviews. I put a 120GB hard drive in there, and it -does- work, but I have some complaints. The USB cable provided is a little short (3 feet) for my uses. The AC adapter isn't built in, so I have an ungainly brick tangled with the cords behind my desk. And lastly, and most important, the fan is very LOUD. I have it next to a new iMac, and the noise difference from when this drive is turned on is very noticeable. These are my complaints, but if these things don't matter to you, this drive is decent besides these flaws. I liked the IDE/SATA interface options, and I think the case is sturdier than a plastic shell. Plus the harddrive mounts to the bottom of this enclosure in a sturdy way, so I'm not worried about it sliding all over the place."
1,Not even fun,"At least Norman's last pop excursion, Lucky to be Me, gave us the camp fun of the diva singing ""I Love You Just the Way You Are"". This disc has no such highlight, and consistently displays some truly hideous singing. Pitches are all over the place; wild skids from vibrato to straight tone sometimes occur on the same note; extremes of loudness and softness bear no discernible relation to the words OR the music. I can't tell what the French songs are about because there are no translations, but English seems just as foreign to Norman here, as she puts lots of interpretive noises in places where they simply don't make any sense. It's too bad--to hear what Norman could have done with this repertoire, go back to her French recital with Dalton Baldwin and those delicious waltzes by Poulenc and Satie; Elly Ameling's Sentimental Me remains my favorite of the diva cocktail-music records."
1,THIS CD IS AN EXPERIMENT THAT SHOULN'T HAVE HAPPENED,"I have truly been a Jessye Norman follower for many years. On most of her cds, Jessye delivers a great performance. This cd is far different from anything Jessye has ever done. Her choice of doing material by Michel Legrand was a good choice, but Jessye choose to record material by Michel that was never introduced into the U.S.A. About half of the songs on this cd are sang in French. On the other selections used, there was only 3 titles that i'm familar with. In all and all i think this was a wasted project. We should demand our money back for this cd."
1,Disappointing,"I purchased a Royal Scale several years ago and used it nearly every day. It was great. I purchased 3 more from AceDepot through Amazon for my children so they didn't have to borrow mine. The first time they arrived in a broken box in a jumbled heap. They were so badly broken that they wouldn't even turn on. UPS picked them up and then 2 more arrived in separate packages. Finally a third one arrived yesterday. None of them work. I was on Tech Support (foreigners) and they said to take out the batteries, wait 10 minutes and then they would work. I called back 4 times and finally they told me to send them back. Don't waste your time with them. The quality has gone out the window since I purchased my first one."
3,it worked fairly well for 4 years...then broke,"It worked well for me for 4 years....and was accurate. The L shaped pin adaptor is badly designed, but I think the scale is not made for as heavy a weights as it claims. Something fell on the scale pad in the basement, a plate...and literally the scale broke open! I promise....it must have been a freak landing, but believe it or not it still reads out off and on. I am looking for a new one, but figured I would see if I was the only one and I am not. I paid about 60 bucks for it 4 years ago....and it gave me decent service. There are glitches where it would not give a weight. In four years of fairly constant shipping of about 20 packages a week I only replaced 2 batteries. I got service out of it...if it lasted another 5 years I would be happier! So I give 3 stars...."
1,IT BROKE!,"I am shocked to see the scale's inner metal structure snapped.It looks like aluminum but, broke like cast iron does.I don't know anything about metal but, it seems very weak.I do have large packages but, I don't abuse my equipment so, I was shocked and disappointed to see that it had broken.It might be capable of weighing over 300lbs but, the scale doesn't seem to be able to handle that kind of weight."
4,digital wireless scales,"I use them for weighing fish at small bass tournaments used about 8 times so far so good, easy to read because of wireless display like them"
1,dont go for this...,I really regretted this purchase. The product looks good but is useless. It worked fine for 3-4 days and suddenly stopped working. It needs expensive batteries. Is not easy to use. Save your money than spending on this useless product.
5,We love this Scale!,I was a little apprehensive about buying this scale due to the other reviews about it's accuracy. We've had this scale for over a month now and it's weight has been perfect. Very easy to turn on and off. Makes a beep sound when the display connects with the platform - it's easy to know that it's ready.It seems like corded scales were always getting broken in our warehouse - cords were getting tangled and frayed. Not a problem with this scale. It's nice to be able to move the platform to readjust for larger boxes but not have to move the display at all.
1,AC Adapter has major design flaw,"Got this thinking it was a great deal, and the scale itself worked pretty well, until the AC adapter failed due to a very poor design. The L-shaped plug from the adapter into the scale base protrudes below the bottom of the scale rather than being properly made to fit in the recess in the base. That means the whole time the adapter it is plugged into the base, the cord is bent at a 90-degree angle underneath it, and in a short period of time it WILL break. There is no way to position the plug-in connector so it does not protrude from the bottom, due to its faulty elbow design(instead of a straight plug-in which would be protected by the recess.) So I am stuck going through 9V batteries to use the scale. I guess they got a great deal on a batch of ill-fitting transformers and decided who cares about quality and functionality. Get the scale if you don't mind running 100% on batteries after a short time."
1,Pure frustration,"Sometimes it works, and sometimes you have to try many times to get a weight. Accurate when it works. 9v battery receptacle won't release battery and is falling apart--wish it took AA batteries. Concept good--I like the remote, but just plain frustrating to use, if it decides to work that day. Digital remote works about a foot from the platform--also constantly have to reset the scale to get it to read. I am now looking for a better choice of scale--one that works and zeroes faster than 2 minutes--when it works."
5,I highly recommend this Product!,"I just recentely found this scale and purchased new. I was using a USPS scale which was use less when it comes to big boxes , no hold button, so you can not see the read out.If you follow the directions that is enclosed it works like a dream. First turn on the scale , wait for the beep to stop, then turn on the remote display , same, and now put the item on the scale and Hurray a read out that can actually be read, no box hanging over the front blocking the read out."
5,Big Gulp,"What a treat this turned out to be. Our little one couldn't hear it enough, and our older one loves it too. She's eager to read it forthe baby and, in her unique style, ""reads"" and enacts from cover to cover. The words have a reassuring and appealing rhythm for the children, and mommy, daddy, and poor Uncle Jai have just about learned it all off by heart. With warm and winning illustrations it's a must for little ones getting to grasp with their environment."
5,Beyond the spiritual plane,"Being a mystical student, I found Liquid Mind to be one of the best musical pieces I have ever experienced for use in meditation sessions or for putting one to sleep without having to resort to medication of some sort. It has a very engaging, soaring and spiritual quality about it. Good as background music while reading or writing too. Have not ever heard such exquisite blending of sounds before."
5,So good I have never heard the end of it,"I have a hard time getting to sleep. This is so good that I am a sleep before hearing the end of the album. I had to put it on shuffle just to hear all the songs. I have had it on my ipod now for a few months. LOVE IT. I would get another download in a heartbeat, as soon as I can listen to the all the songs I have now.You won't be sorry. Get it!"
2,Liquid Mind - No Direction,Based on the reviews my expectations were higher than they should have been. I spent some time listening to the CD and frankly I was disappointed with the lack of direction of any of the cuts. It just meandered from one cut to another and I felt no sense of attachment to any of the pieces. There is no sense of adventure or becoming part of the music - in fact I thought it was worse than elevator music
5,TOTAL RELAXATION,"from the first note you will feel the WARMTH of this cd.""WARM IN YOU"" .The warm vibes glide warm and soft,just like the tides of the sea.yOU FEEL IMMEDIATELY AT EASE. ALL the stress floats off your body.At the same time you feel the positive energy rising ""like a star out of the ocean"".TOP RELAXATION MUSIC!"
5,Exquisite,"If a person's soul could be transcribed into music... it would be this. Chuck Wild finds a way to transcend that which cannot be spoken, into music. It's exquisitely beautiful and infinitely rare to find such genius."
4,Excellent Debut Collection,"Distracted and other poems has a Plath-like quality in that the imagery is rich and thought-provoking. The subject matter in this collection is intelligent, emotional, and vivid. Poems such as ""Another Ted Hughes,"" ""On the Obituary of the Doctor,"" and ""Sheets of Sleep"" juxtapose the beautiful with the haunting. The line breaks are perfect, as it the subtle cadence of several of the poems. Gajkowski is an excellent up-and-coming poet that I hope to hear more from. This is a outstanding collection, overall, and is a delight to read."
2,Booorrrriiingg!!!,"I bought this series because it looked good and it had 4 1/2 star ratings. I don't know why it had such good ratings because the show was very boring to me, it wasn't going anywhere and I lost interest in it halfway and stopped watching it. I've seen a lot of anime over the years and I hardly ever don't like any of the anime I see on tv or buy myself. I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,Recieved it broken,"Price wise its not a bad deal, however when I recieved it the center clip that holds some of the discs in was broken. Because of this the disc holder falls out of the case if upright."
4,An action oriented story,"This is a story that puts the pedal to the floor at the begining and never lets up. If you like action Anime stories you should be satisfied with Heroic Age. The story has a warm and fuzzy ending. The ending does involve some misty oriental mysticism reminiscent of the ending of Glass Fleet. The Japanese appreciate this more than we do and we need to accept it.In this type of story, it it unrealistic to expect much character development. Age is the best developed and the story is really about him, not Princess D. The rest of the characters appear and contribute to the story.The animation is very good. That is important in a story having so much action.The only fault that I found was that too much time was devoted to combat between Nardos. I realize that the Japanese like Mecha and some adjustment must be made for their preferences, but sometimes it seemed that the Mech combat was being stretched out in order to fill out an episode.Overall, I was satisfied with my purchase."
3,"good place to start, but try the Smith/Moody book too.","Ted is a really nice guy, and I like his approach on this subject. He also writes great books on animals. This pamflet is nice, but look at the books by Mark Smith and Raymond Moody to get more info."
4,A solid book ... here is an even EASIER way to see the aura scientifically,"Take a spray bottle fill it with water and a capful of bleach (other good additives include lemon juice, vinegar et al.)*Note tapwater is poisoned with fluoride and other chemicals by the U.S. (Nazi) Govt and has a HIGH sewage content too (the bleach will take care of most of that)Now spray it all around your body AND spray a light coating on your body - clothes included.You will you see your aura.ONe reason this works so well is it messes with the ELECTRICITY - which is WHAT IS PREVENTING you from not only seeing your aura but is messing up planet earth in many ways.So please note - if you're doing this indoors you will want to use candles not ELECTRIC light .Also note - our 'sun' (really a solar 'disk' - see Egyptian texts) is not healthy either."
2,Aura-bull,"Why two stars? Because there is a perverse joy that comes with reading this slim volume of new age hogwash. People buy into this? Hey, I've got a bridge to sell ya, too. I did the exercises, they didn't work."
2,It's OK,"I just can't seem to get into this book. I've tried reading it a couple of times and it's just not what I thought. This surprises me as Ted Andrews seems to be a good ""explainer""."
5,the best!,"If you have ever wondered if the Bible is true and accurate, or just a bunch of made-up fairy tales, you need to read this book... Dr Lutzer certainly knows his subject and writes clearly and simply, with solid logic. If you give it a read, you will not be disappointed, and you might even be pleasantly surprised."
2,One Reason Why You Can't Trust Lutzer,"This is a book written by a Christian, for Christians. If you are a Christian and enjoyed books such as Strobel'sThe Case for Christ, you will likely enjoy this book as well.While this book may sway some undecided agnostics who are on the fence about Christianity, it is doubtful that it will have an impact on serious skeptics. This needs to be stated, since the introduction of the book says that the target audience includes such skeptics.As a quick example. Lutzer's own science has a problem. In chapter 5, Lutzer, in reference to the Milky Way, says, ""Its diameter is about 100,000 light-years"". According to Genesis, the stars were created at least two days after the earth. Unless Earth is at least 100,000 years old, the light from these stars could not yet have reached our planet (a light year is how far light can travel in a year, in a vacuum). If Earth is less than 6,000 years old, then every star we see has to be less than 6,000 light years away."
4,Makes an Very Good Case,"Erwin Lutzer is one of today's leading theologians, and the case he presents that the Bible is more than just a guide to living is an example of that. The only shortcoming is that he doesn't address whether the predictions entered in the Bible were actually written after the fact. That criticism is well-rebuffed by Hank Hannegraff in The Complete Bible Answer Book."
5,The Book is Excellent,"It is a great resource for explaining reasons the Bible can be trusted because history from the times of the ""Old Testiment"" prove its truth."
3,occasional bleeding pen..,"These pens write beautifully but, occasionally bleed when writing for long periods of time causing a mess. It doesn't happen all the time so I won't say that I don't recommend them. If you need them for writing a couple of paragraphs then these pens will do good."
2,Super heavy duty---not!,"The tarp arrived with a 4"" long scrape on it, and the tarp was so thin that the scrape was enough to have produced a cut right through this ""Super Heavy Duty"" material. Thank heavens I bought it through Amazon, because they provided for an easy and prompt full refund. The label on the tarp from the manufacturer indicated that I would've had to pay the frieght to send it back for a replacement. I then went to Home Depot's site and ordered one. The Tarps Direct tarp I got through Amazon costs about $50, which I paid because it looked to be an especially durable product. The same size tarp from Depot costed only about $35--but it actually turned out to be a better thicker tarp!"
5,Fantastic Durability,"I hung this tarp over the dining/cooking/visiting area for a week of remote camping. It held up to wind and rain superbly. Last year, a tarp I had purchased locally disintegrated."
2,Good Thick Tarp But...,"Good thickness to replace canopy tarp. Heavy weight so it took me a while with a ladder to pull it over the tube frame. Overall good quality except it was shipped with a small hole. I did not want to return it so I just patch it up on both sides with silicone sealant. Hole was not on the folded edge where maybe some one drag it and cause a hole. This was on an area on one of the inside folded surfaces so you cannot even see it on the outside package. Looks like hole exist during fabrication. Would rate higher except for quality.On existing 12 X 20 frame, tarp is a little large so you will collect water when it rains. If someone is planning to use as replacement canopy tarp, just beware it is a little large."
4,Amazing game,I purchased this game recently after somehow loosing the first copy I had. This game is very fun to play! It can get challenging at some levels but is definitely entertaining. I would recommend this to any age group. The directions are very easy to follow.
1,Monopoly Tycoon did not work,the game did not work when i installed it to my computer. It installed ok and loaded but when i tried to play it the game just froze and would not do anything. I reinstalled the game and still had the same problem i would not recommend this product.
2,So So,The game took lots of manipulation to be able to play. The first couple of times the game locked up my computer and i had to restart. The audio is completely inop. the CD skips quite a bit. I am disappointed with this seller.
2,Did not enjoy the read,"Did not enjoy reading this book as I thought I would. Could not even finish reading the book. I think the style of writing did not suit me. Would recommend instead ""Toward a new psychology for women"" by Jean Baker Miller- more concise and to the point. Perhaps my expectations were too high after reading the latter book."
5,"""I get it""",I actually am still reading this book because I am taking my time digesting it all. It's really giving me insight on how women's thoughts and opinions have been influenced from birth. It's helping me validate my own feelings and opinions.
1,Gilligan just doesn't get it!,"Carol Gilligan's ""research"" has been strongly contradicted by Cristina Hoff Summers in the May 2000 Atlantic Monthly. Before buying the Gilligan book, I suggest you read Hoff Sommers' devastating article."
3,Sperry Top-Sider,"I didn't really like the way the shiny gray looked, but they are not bad. The shoes run about a half size shorter than most so if you wear a 9.5, you may want to order a 10. The width is true to size."
3,"Great songs, Bad sound","I really dig Pigeon John and was really excited to hear this release. I rate the tracks high.....and the sound terrible. Didn't realize I was buying what sounds like a 10th gen tape dub transferred to disc. Anyway, the songs are good. Enjoy."
5,Excellent!,One thing is to learn how exactly the WWW works in technical terms and another is how to apply it to your business. This book is trully enlightning
4,1 Nation crew.....One step ahead..........good!,This new one form Kirk franklin is a good step up from his last. I still like his last one better but this one is a good follow up. He experiments with latin music a lot on this and even more into Hip-Hop. The one thing different you will see is that his group is smaller and he changed the name of the group...again! Overall it looks like it just made thier singing better and they talk about a lot more on this album that will have some people suprised. Overall he did good on this cd and came with something new again.Get it!
5,Make a joyful noise unto The Lord,"This is an anointed man of God and the group is also. Every song on this cd Kirk Franklin presents 1NC will lift up the Lord and also bless you and I mean every song. no matter what you're going through. Kirk Franklin and the family, Kirk Franklin's Nu Nation is excellent also from beginning to end and God's property as well, all need to have *****. If you want a cd that praises God and you can pump up the volume where ever you are and get your praise on then 1NC is it. I had no idea that this cd was that goooooooooooooood! I hope they make another one. Peace."
3,Left of center,"I have been a fan of Kirk Franklin since his early days with the Dallas/Fort Worth Mass Choir. I think that this album represents that Kirk has found himself left of center and can't really get back. The intent of his earlier recordings was dynamic and affected the direction of contemporary gospel music dramatically. As I listened to this recording, I couldn't help but think how awesome a composer and director he is, but also longed for the days when the anointing of The Family used to highlight his talents and his desire to minister. This recording is a little left of center and it meets the minimum requirement of 4 good songs to purchase, but I hope this doesn't represent the future offering from this talented individual. If possible, listen to this before you purchase it. This is not for the traditionalist or those looking for 'old' Kirk Franklin."
1,NO NO NO,"I miss the family, that was what you can call gospel music this mess that you are doing now is terrible change can be good but this one wasn't"
5,Very Inspirational,"I bought this cd the first day it came out. They are some good songs on it. Breath Away reminds us that God is always with us no matter what we are going through. My other favorites are Unconditional, Could've Been Me and In Your Grace. I love this cd. Great job Kirk! I pray that God will continue to bless your ministry. One Nation Crew you are the bomb. Let God continue to use you and don't stray. All the best ya'll"
3,"Good Dance Album, so-so for listening","If you like electro/Terrence Fixmer this might be a good addition. I had Fixmer's Muscle Machine and I got tired of him after a few listens, so it's not much different here. McCarthy's vocals are great, beats are pretty standard, but I think the music background itself could use more imaginitive melody/buildup for listening to instead of just looping argeggios. Ebb fans should listen to a few songs first though before jumping to get this."
3,Wish I had listened to it before I bought it.,"This is average stuff at best. The whole thing is very repetitive and has tired beats. Granted this review is a knee jerk response from only listening to it a few times but, it's still below par in my book . McCarthy's vocals are good and without him I would have only given it two stars. If your looking for something good in this genre, try listening to the Cyber-tech project."
2,Charly Zaa lost his sound,"This album was overproduced by Emilio Estefan, and the sound that was charlie Zaa has been completely erased so that he sounds like elevator music"
1,Surely you don't belive this...,"You people who buy into this nonsense are truly, truly sad.. I don't get angry or even try to dispute this stuff anymore. If you were capable of any shred of open minded argument based on fact and evidence you wouldn't be in this situation. Let history judge Bill Clinton, and his detractors. We will see who looks foolish."
2,5 stars????? get real,"Most dr. Who fans consider ""The Gunfighters"" to be the worst Dr. Who adventure ever, and while the nostalgic aspect and humor cannot be ignored, we need to be objective in our reviews and the person who gave this 5 stars is not really being honest.Thoughout this four part adventure, a singer warbles verses from ""The ballad of the last chance saloon"" which at once point is also sung by the doctors companion Steven and the worst compaion ever Dodo accompanies him on the paino ;and as bad as british actors trying to do american accents are.....imagine them trying to do early weatern accents. Horrible!!!!I'm not saying I didn't enjoy this video because I did...in fact i was in stiches for all four episodes, but to give this one anymore than two stars would be being unobjective.i bought the entire end of the universe collection, so i would have bought this one regardless."
2,Dont waste your money on this DVD,"I am a huge fan of Doctor Who, with 100s of videos and DVDs plus rare footage etc.The Gunfighters has 2 major issues, the incidental music is bloody awful and the acting must be the worst ever. The story is full of holes with no real direction. William Hartnell actually acts in a few scenes but isn't really the main character in the show.As a doctor who fan this show rates among the worst ever produced until the series was ruined in the late 1980s.Avoid or rent if you must see it."
3,Spectre of the Gun.,"Upon reflection my opinion of this wild west opera has changed. The constant musical passages still annoy me but the actual story and accents do not. I find I enjoy watching this story more then most Sylvester MacCoy stories and Trial of a TimeLord, also it moves at a faster pace then some other stories from the Hartnell era, like The Ark and The War Machines.Westerns were very popular in the 60's, even Star Trek did a version of this incident two years later. (Where my title comes from.)Whilst watching this story make sure you do not eat any sweeties given to you by The Celestial Toymaker, or YOU may get a toothache!"
4,Another Good Episode From the Hartnell Era,"I love stuff from early in the series, and especially the First Doctor, as it set the stage for what was to come and what we now know as Science Fiction's longest running show. I was happy to see The Gunfighters being issued on DVD and, contrary to what some say, it was enjoyable and lived up to my expectations. William Hartnell really seems to be enjoying himself and is in fine form, there are some tongue-in-cheek, laughable moments (seriously, some scenes are *meant* to poke a little fun at typical Western movies) and there are some great extras included; such as a behind-the-scenes look at the show, as well as the pop-up info that I always enjoy."
3,Bwa-hahahahaa!,"""The Gunfighters"" was long considered the absolute worst episode of Doctor Who (unfortunately, some of Sylvester McCoy's early episodes are contenders), so it's in some ways sad that this series of episodes still exist while so many better ones are seemingly lost forever. For many, though, it's so bad it's good (as in ""unintentionally hilarious""). The accents are simply awful, but the really painful part is the warbling saloon ballad that runs through the episodes. And, for me, the character Dodo.However, it's good to see it released for completeness' sake and for the solid bonus documentary on the series' third season. For the casual Whovian, it's a pass, but for the fan, well, you just have to see it to believe it. :)"
5,quality & comfort,"Very durable sandals, when I am ready, they are still in good shape, I will buy another pair of Clarks."
1,not easy to wear,The shoe is heavy and can scrape your feet after wearing it for awhile. Not recommended.
2,Not up to Clark standards,"I've had Clark sandals in the past, and they have been very comfortable. These were stiff, and uncomfortable if worn without socks. They did not seem to be the quality that I have ome to expect from Clarks. I must say, however, that returning them was very easy, and Amazon credited me with the full price."
3,Fresh and lovely,This collection by a gifted singer brings a fresh exploration of classic songs. Treading the outer parameters of jazz while staying true to it's (and her own) musical origins.
3,Just a gadget,"Neat little gadget here i put on my 04 f150.The only performance i can see that this thing made is the difference in shift firmness(tow mode).I originally bought it for better gas mileage.I really couldnt tell a difference in any of the modes for better gas mileage.I even wrote to Edge and asked them if it was suppose to give better mpg and they stated that it only gives 0.6-0.8 mpg gain.It does have a bunch of cool features,most of which i didnt need.Heck my dash has all the gauges i need already.It does seem to be high quality and made well but truthfully i think its just a novelty item.This product would probably work well if you tow a lot or have large tires but i dont have either.My towing is just a small trailer and lawn mower so i dont think i need this for the price.I ended up taking it out and reselling it.It just aint worth the tall price tag for the minimal mpg gain and for a daily driver."
4,Great product and great price!,I have a 2008 f150 truck an extreme mode makes a big difference. I got it on sale for 280 bucks. Great deal
3,very good product..,"Overall the programmer is great. I personally think this is the best programmer you can buy. But i paid a extra 23 dollars for one day shipping and it got here in 3 which i wasnt to happy about. And also amazon shows that the programmer and the dash pod are recently bought together so you pay a extra 50 dollars and the programmer comes with one too so.... you waste 50 dollars and have a extra pod, but overall the programmer is great"
1,Not Worth It.......,"Installation and programming worked as described. However, made my truck run poorly, terrible gas mileage, transmission shifted randomly. Seriously thought it was going to permantly damage my truck. Set back to stock and returned the unit. Not worth the money for sure......"
1,Garbage,"Nobody wants to take responsibility for this product. It does not communicate with my 2007 f-150, i keep getting error codes and i've tried repeatedly to contact the supplier (Trends Auto) and they will/have not returned numerous messages i left. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone (or buying anything from Trends Auto). Basically I paid $350 for an RPM gauge."
5,A KLEPTO CULT CLASSIC,"This little movie has a lot of heart. I was surprised to see Scott Wolf (From Party of Five) in it, it must have been one of his first movies and he's great and Kletpo Clyde. Maureen Flannigan and Scott have a lot of chemistry.It's got both suspsense and humor--Why don't more video stores have it? Dig around to find it if you must and check it out yourself."
3,it was cute for nickelodean,i liked the movie and i did like the songs. But it was way too goody goody. The songs were something that ya would like but if ya are into different kinda stuff. Then don't get this cd.
1,Terrible,"THe movie was terrible, so I was hoping for a better sound track. Actually, I think LIMP BIZKIT is better. What is this, calling yourself a ""dumb blonde""? Now, I'm a lyrics person, so if you like the music then this is for you!"
1,Just a comment about that single,"Okay, I just watched the video for that ""Another dumb Blonde"" or whatever song. At first, I thought it was a joke or a Maybelline commercial. A reassuring factor was the singer's Mariah Carey-ish off-beat repetition usually reserved for the last 20 seconds of a song. It came up in the first 20 seconds! Also, I noticed an attempt at a Christina Aguilera video with several short cuts to teenagers partying on the beach, but then I realized, ""Isn't this supposed to be a Snow Day song?"" Don't take my review as a criticism of the entire album. Try to enjoy the others, but PLEASE omit this song!"
2,i only like smash mouth,"smash mouth is the only good song get astro lounge instead for allstar and more and i like knock on wood more from mightymightybostones(BOSTON-es! BOSTON-es! Duh,theyre from BOSTON! Boston should be renamed Bostone,but boston's history-old history."
1,did not have the songs that played at end of movie,"bought for the lawst song that sang during end credits, was not there did not have the songs that played at end of movie"
3,Schuyler Fisk's song should have been on the soundtrack...,"This CD is all right I guess. I did like ""There She Goes"" on the soundtrack.... But I really enjoyed Schuyler Fisk's track ""It's Not Her"" on the ending credits of the movie and it's not even on the soundtrack. Too bad. She's the artist who has the beautiful voice (hint: BEAUTIFUL VOICE) and cute lyrics to make a wonderful song. In other words, ""It's Not Her"" was the best track of the entire film. It's a shame Schuyler's little song was snuffed out by the poppy crap we call ""music"" today. If anyone wants to check out a cute tune, check out Schuyler's song at the end of the film. It's the second song in the credits...you know, AFTER the overly hyped ""Another Dumb Blonde""."
5,Great Review On Snow Day Soundtrack!,This CD is full of some great songs that you can listen to anytime. The songs are upbeatand fun to listen to. Here are some great songs to go along with a great movie.
4,I really like this watch..,"I've had this watch for about 2 years now. I've had no problem with keeping it fully charged. My only problem has been the heart charm.The clasp that kept it on would pull apart and I'd end up searching frantically for it.Also the face of the watch would scratch very easily, and it is very noticible on the black face."
4,Building the Foundation,"As this is part of season 1, it is important to remember that there are some growing pains with MST3K. However, there are many great one-liners in there and the movie itself is pretty enjoyable (until the climax)."
4,funny...but,"It's not bad. I guess it is one of the first episodes. It's a great show but they're still learning where and when to make their funny comments. One good thing, the one girl who's a psychic, I'm pretty sure she's Roberta on the Disney movie, Swiss Family Robinson. Pretty cool she's on this too"
5,buy it now,"i must say that this album is one of my favorite ribot works...his guitar playing is top notch and the compositions display yet another side of the musical chameleon that he is...no more words, buy the record."
4,Good book,"I had to have this for a class I was taking, so I probably would not have ordered it otherwise. The author takes a rather scientific approach to study, which may appeal to some. While not my preferred methodology, it still holds some good insights."
3,"Studying, Interpreting and Applying the Bible","Very disappointed. I ordered 30 books...and have been receiving them one at a time, and then only received the first 20 books. They have canceled my order. why were they listed available if they weren't!!!"
4,Princeton Tec Apex,"I use my apex for extreme caving environments in the caribbean.I am very happy with it. The ergonomics of the switches is good, can be operated with muddy hands without dirtying up the lens. The fact that it is waterproof is a big plus too The tilt ability of the light makes it great for adjusting angles while my helmet is off, can be used to read at night in camp.The spot is superior to other more expensive headlamps.Only drawback for me are the tabs that attach it to the elastic strap. The first one I got dropped when opening it new, and one of the tabs broke. I just tie-wrapped it to my helmet, and it held tight.My helmet took a fall of over 250ft onto rocks, and though the battery compartment smashed up, I ran the wires to a power source, and the leds still worked!! Extremely tough.I heartily recommend it."
4,If only the flood LEDs weren't so blue...,"This light is just about as good as I've been able to find, and I really like the option of having both a spotlight and a floodlight in a single headlamp. The ergonomics are also very good, and despite being heavier than some of the alternatives I've found this headlamp very comfortable even for extended use. However, I use the flood LEDs more than the spot, and run up against the problem apparently found in all 5mm LEDs: ugly bluish light. The spot has very nice light but is too narrow for most purposes. The floods give good area illumination, but I'd rather them a bit brighter and the bad color rendition is just highlighted by contrast with the much better light from the spot. I lost my Apex a few months ago and very nearly bought another one, but was dissuaded by the bad color of the flood LEDs. That said, I'm perhaps overly picky about such things and in all other respects this is an excellent headlamp."
2,For self-publishing only,"If I were self-publishing my book, I would give this book five stars. Only because I'm seeking a publisher I give it two. The book is well-written and full of ideas. I've met the author and she is sophisticated and experienced in self-publishing. I recommend it to anyone who publishes his own book."
5,You Can Market Your Book,"You Can Market Your Book is a gem for writers who are serious about the business of not only getting published, but getting their books read! The author leaves no stones unturned, taking you on a detailed journey from conception to completion. She not only gives you the basics, but even addresses those frustrating exceptions to the rule.If you have an idea or a manuscript that's been sitting on your shelf, this book will be nothing short of an empowering discovery-- that you have all the tools you need!"
