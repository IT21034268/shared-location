3,Nice Helmet,Nice helmet. Good look especially if you like the Livestrong brand. More than fairly price. If yuo are looking for a good helmet at a good price this would be a good choice.
5,Excellent Helmet,Great helmet. Light and cool for riding. Good color helps with visibility. Shipping was very quick and I had it as soon as I needed it.
4,good quality helmet,nice helmet and nice fit. The head size adjustment is easy to use and adjustment of straps is easy as well. The visor is a good size as well.
4,A newbie bicyclist that's happy with this helmet,"I just started bike riding again after not having ridden since I was a teenager. Back then if you wore a helmet, you were laughed at. Nowadays I think you're foolish if you don't wear one.I knew that I wanted one that was comfortable first and stylish second. With theGiro Indicator Sport Bike HelmetI have both. The initial fit was pretty easy and I was ready to go riding within about 10 minutes. I like that it's lightweight and breathes nicely. Also I have long hair and as another reviewer mentioned it's easy to put into a ponytail and slip through the back for better comfort.Overall an excellent helmet and I think the reviews show that. The price is worth it especially if it ends up saving your life."
4,Giro Indicator,"I have purchased 3 of this style helmet for members of my family and everyone likes them. Fit and finish are excellent, however I must agree with another review that the one size fits all may not fit all. However returning the helmet is simple and virtually painless if it is too small. I believe that if you measure the head where the helmet would sit and it is under 24"" I'm pretty sure it will fit."
1,not recommended,"Uncomfortable due to minimalist padding and strap design.1. Someone mentioned here it's not for big faces - it's probably because the front strap is routed close to one's face instead of, like on fox helmet I have, being attached to the side edge. In effect strap touches your face in more places than necessary.2. I confirm what other reviewer said that self stick pads that come with the helmet are useless due to glue sticking to peel off backing instead of the foam pad (they use cheap foam anyway - probably good for few months anyway)I'd suggest to spend $10 more and try to get more comfortable design."
3,Good BUT!,"I love the helmet. Light, plenty of air. But the front shield was loose when I received it and not it doesn't stay on right. I might glue it, or even send it back. I'm not sure. But the helmet is awesome if it works right."
4,good general use road/mtn bike helmet,Recently bought this helmet for wife. Best color from the choices available. The red and white stands out when riding through the city when sun is setting. Easy to notice by drivers. One complaint is ear strap twists below the ears. It does not rest flush to the face and is annoying. No way to fix this problem. Also the straps do take some adjusting to make it fit right. The helmet does provide good head protection in case of an accident.
4,"Sung, comfortable helmet",I use this helmet everyday on my 12mi ride to and from work. Helmet is light and the strap system make for a comfortable fit. I purchased for price and am happy with the performance. Get a brain bucket.
5,Comfortable and Inexpensive,Was buying a new hybrid bike and this was the helmet they required for the test ride. Was immediately taken with how comfortable and light it was - especially compared to my old one - so I bought one on the spot. (Unfortunately paid a lot more than the Amazon price!) It also looks sleeker and not so childish. Can't speak from experience about the most important aspect (hope I never have to!) but by all accounts this provides excellent crash protection. Because it's so comfortable I'm not tempted to leave it at home. Very pleased with this.
5,great helmet,Helmet fit perfectly and delivered quickly. Had to replace after two crashes with head accidents (no injuries). Have high hopes for this one. Even ready to use in case of tornado.
5,giro,"I bought this to match my new bike. It is my second giro, they are both very comfortable and airy and the straps adjust easily."
3,the strap fits funny,"i've only used it a few times, but the strap connection seems to jut against my face. maybe i'm just dumb, but I think it might be poorly designed. other than that, it looks great and I'm sure if i fell on my noggin i'd be alright."
5,Great Helmet,This helmet was really exactly what I wanted. It has a good fit and actually looks good on my head. The cheapo helmets that I was looking at at local retail stores were gigantic on my head (super thick) and I looked like a kid riding his bike in a cereal commercial or something. This has a much better 'low profile' design and it includes several extra cushioning pads that you can place where you want to inside the helmet. Very good purchase!
3,nice design,"i like the helmet nice shape and all. my only problem is that it says universal fit on the web site. then when you get it home the paper work says universal fit between 2 sizes. for products like these Amazon should start posting a like to read the users manual, so that we do not have to rely on the company advertisement to see if the product is what we are looking for."
3,Easy to adjust but straps do not lay flat,"The helmet fits well and is easy enough to adjust. I have very long hair (down to my thighs) and with this helmet I am able to pull my braid through the lowest back strap, which both stabilizes the helmet and serves to keep my hair off of my neck, so I stay cool. However, many of the plastic straps have sharp edges which catch on and damage my hair, and I cannot get the nylon straps which run alongside the side of my jaw to lay flat - they twist and are annoying. Next time I will spend the $10 more and get something comfortable."
1,faulty design,"This helmet is painful to wear, even for a few minutes. The straps are designed so that they can never lay flat on your head and face and the hard plastic pieces protrude and poke your head. It came with extremely thin pads already inside the front of the helmet and additional oval shaped pads in a bag. There was no mention of what to do with these oval pads in the instructions. I would be surprised if anyone could wear this helmet. It's being returned."
4,Great helmet,"Good helmet. Fits great, looks great. Bought it today in the local store for $40, thinking that if I find the same helmet sufficiently cheaper on the 'Net I can return it. But for $4 price difference I'd rather support local guys..."
4,helmet straps were installed wrong,"I like this helmet, however when I recieved it the straps were in wrong and my husband had to totally take the strap out and put it back in the right way. This was somewhat time consuming and I am glad he knew how to do this. I would not have been able to figure it out. Other than that the helmet seems comfortable and otherwise no problems."
4,Exactly what I wanted,"I spent half an hour at a local bike shop trying on different helmets. For some reason the size just didn't work right, and most of them were pretty expensive. I took a chance with this one and was pleasantly surprised. The fit was perfect. The design was perfect, and the price can't be beat!Update: I took away one star because the 2 side straps don't lay flush against your face."
4,Good value helmet,"I've been using this helmet for 8 months now and it fits great. I use it for my daily bike commute and it is perfect for that. However, ventilation is slightly lacking for more serious cycling and I ordered a new race helmet."
4,Home Sweet Home,"I have had a relatively new interest in quilted houses and not that much experience with applique . I loved this book and have been inspired to design my own houses from what I have learned from these two authors .I gave this 4 stars rather than 5 as I did not enjoy the second half of the book as much as it is mainly photographs of friends' home (lovely though they are ) Also , would have appreciated more instruction on bias tape and making it cooperate as well as mastering those fine points on the bird beaks and flowers. However if you are adept at applique this is the book for you ."
2,"Challengers Rock, But This Album Does Not","The Challengers are one of the finest instrumental surf bands ever, but this album lacks their magic touch. Aside from the slick cover of ""Hava Nagila"" and ""Apache,"" the cd has tepid takes of songs like ""On Broadway."" Only for the most hardcore Challengers fans. If you want a good dose of this great group, I recommend ""Killer Surf,"" their ""Best Of"" collection."
4,"Some good, low key tunes","I was one of the first to pick up a copy of Centre St. Tracks' excellent debut compilation CD, ""These are Centre St. Tracks"". Born on the mean streets of JP as the brainchild of music industry entrepreneur Ms. Nora Murphy, this CD showcases the sometimes formidable talent of a few of the Boston area's still under cover rock bands. Highlights include the Neil Young/Weezer fusion piece ""If I Was to Write a Love Song"" (Whistle Jacket), the little bit Radioheady ""City vs. Country"" (The Mobius Band), and the Pixies inspired ""Wishing I Was John"" (Prime Rib). ""Sinkhole"" (Choo Choo La Rouge) and ""Coffee Shop Girl"" (The Cautions) are also a lot of fun, if not symphonic masterpieces.This is a mostly mellow disc which only occasionally lets it rip, but at less than $9.00, it's a steal. This is especially true if you live in the Boston area or have an interest in the local music scene."
2,Not much substance,"Although I'm sure Keegan has studied war thoroughly, I must agree with two previous reviewers about 1) his questionable belief that famine and disease are insignificant problems (maybe for us residents of the developed world) and 2) the blatantly Eurocentric view of war (albeit the few references to China, Japan, and Genghis Khan). AIDS and malaria, poverty and hunger continue to kill millions of people in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Also, while Keegan states that ""it is poor states that mainly cause war"" he makes no mention of the involvement (historical, political, or economic) of wealthier nations in those wars.But more importantly, though this may be an entertaining read, WAR AND OUR WORLD actually tells little about the nature of war, its origins, its transformations, and its possible future. 74 pages is just too short to even introduce a topic as wide in scope as war, and Keegan doesn't come close to providing a sturdy framework for a brief discussion of it."
4,A real education for women of our time,"As a ""baby boomer"" woman, I really appreciated the chance to look back and review the history leading up to the changes we saw in our generation regarding women's rights and women's choices. It was particularly illuminating to have the transformations I myself experienced since childhood encapsulated in such a clear format; it helped me understand how my own grandmother and mother saw their roles. I enjoyed the authors' pithy and practical writing style."
3,Important historical info,"The book had tons of interesting historical info on the roles of women and medical practitioners. It was a little too scholarly for beach reading, yet contained fascinating windows into our past. Some sections were repetitive after making a point.I would hope that young women would read it for perspective on the women's movement and health issues. Those of us in the baby boomer generation experienced discrimination that our daughters don't relate to. We may have ""come a long way, baby,"" yet women still do not have the equality that we should in government, the board room or compensation."
1,Unreadable,"Did you ever try to have a conversation with someone, but their ideology on unrelated topics kept you from communicating? This book is like that: unreadable.Co-authored by an academic socialist in 1978, I read the 2005 edition to see if the authors learned anything in the interim. Apparently the Berlin Wall never fell, and the USSR never dissolved. Women's problems accelerated by not following Marx and Engels, the Industrial Revolution harmed and degraded everyone's standard of living, bla, bla.Skip to the Conclusion and it's still more of the same: the Market (their erroneously definition of it) is the root of all women's problems. Wow."
5,An intimate focus,"In this stunning collection, photographer Marion Patterson shares her mystical vision of the western landscape. She focuses on the intimate details of the environment-a hidden waterfall cascading down a rocky stair, the twisted roots of a fallen redwood, patterns of foam bubbles and pebbles left by the receding tide. She guides us in savoring the small delights of nature."
5,Graduate Monetary Theory,"This book prepares a student with the background for several relevant debates in monetary theory. Written by Dr. White to cover the material he presents in a semester graduate lecture, this book has the best of both scope and detail. He builds a solid background with Mengerian foundations of money. Then he thoroughly builds a scheme of understanding monetary policy in a gold-backed system. Once this is accomplished, modern financial market complexities are built on top of the books over-arching analysis. Topics made clear include Inflationary bias (Barrow, Gordon, Kyland, and Prescott), hyperinflation, rules vs. discretion, bank deposit insurance, and many other central bank policies which can be difficult without proper guidance."
5,It's Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,My girls and myself have been having a blast singing the songs that come on cd. I love how you can sing with the words and without the words on the cd
3,relax n nap STINKS !!,"My first reaction is to the STRONG odor which comes from the foam. The tag on the case say Ureathane foam product. Advertizing states ""memory foam"" I am skeptical because I have a cushion made from NASA memory foam and it shows the memory effect when you place your fingers on it. The relax and nap does not.. Nor does it have the ""SMELL"" that is quite annoying in the relax n' nap item. I really wonder if this is the memory foam or just a regular foam pillow with the unique breathing shape. It seems to support the head properly for 'face-down' resting; however I don't know if the odor will let me actually ""nap"""
5,SCI-FI Private Eye,"This is a very good unabridged audio of short stories. Was sent and received within a reasonable time and was in good shape. I enjoyed it very much, thank you."
1,Never worked,"Received this item and tried plugging it into my K1m. The K1m didn't even detect it was plugged in, and it never worked. When I plug in the USB to 2.5mm adapter that came with the phone, the music player stops playing music on the speaker built into the phone, but with this headset plugged in, it just keeps playing from the built in speaker.After several emails back and forth with the seller, they finally informed me that there was a defect with the unit and they refunded my account.I am very disappointed that Motorola would produce a product of this poor quality. Steer clear of this item."
1,garbage,this thing fell apart on day one. fortunately it was so cheap it wasn't worth wasting my time to get a refund. It's definately not worth the time to order it though.
5,An engrossing real story behind a great actress-comedienne,"I'm about 90% through this book. But I can tell you that Miss Burnett has written a terrific autobiography, full of tears & hardship as well as laughs. In a childhood filled with despair & battling desperate odds, she grew up to be one of the greatest actress-comediennes of our time. If you look at the popular ""family"" sketches she did on her own show, and then compare it with her life story, you can see the parallels of dysfunctional love & yearnings to be something more.The book seemingly skips over ""The Carol Burnett Show"" years (since so much has been discussed about that show anyway) & covers the childhood/early career years. The book has been updated to include how she dealt with the recent death of her daughter, Carrie Hamilton.Filled with rare photos, letters & funny stories in between the pathos, this book gives the reader a deeper respect for someone who really deserved the enormous success heaped upon her."
5,Sad & Funny,Carol has the knack of telling a sad story with humor in it. I really enjoyed this book as I have enjoyed her show through the years.
4,Carol Burnett,I really enjoyed the book but I felt that she could have given a little more detail in some areas. I just felt like there could have been more.
5,"Carol Burnett ""One More Time""",I grew up watching The Carol Burnett show and have always loved her. It was interesting reading about the environment she grew up in - definitely the source of her humor! She is a great story teller!
5,Stored in my cupboard,"After storing the Mackerel for two years in my cupboard here in WA State after visiting Maine, I finally decided to just eat them on some good crackers. Pure heaven! I have no recipes for Mackerel so I had not used them. Now I realize anything but plain crackers is ""gilding the lilly""."
5,A quality product......,loaded mith omega3. A really good quality product that I use as a snack or add to some dishes like Asian noodles. These are top shelf in quality and I heartly reccomend them.
1,NO ERICA HERE,"I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED WITH THIS TAPE, THIS HAPPEND TO BE THE 1998 EMMY AWARDS, WHICH DOES NOT INCULDE ERICA RECIEVING HER AWARD, THE AUTHOR OF THIS TAPE NEEDS TO BE MORE SPECIFIC ON WHAT THE TAPE IS REALLY ABOUT. IF YOU LIKE PRE AND POST INTERVIEWS THEN THIS IS THE TAPE FOR YOU. OTHERWISE IT'S IS A WASTE OF MONEY."
4,Great program at an incredible price,"This is a great DVD. I thought I was getting the usual 45-50 minute documentary but it is an informative and entertaining 90 minutes-for $12.99. The presenters/commentators were well-chosen and the graphics were well-done. Another great job, National Geographic Channel!"
2,"Trust me, don't buy this one","I bought this one along with ""Journey to the Edge of the Universe"". I watched that one first and put this one in and I had to turn it off 30 minutes in. It does not even come close to the first Blu-Ray. If you are looking for a astronomy lesson with cool graphics, buy ""Inside the Milky Way"" but if you want possibly the greatest space documentary created to this date, you really cannot go wrong with ""Journey to the Edge of the Universe""."
1,Nonsense - Don't be deceived,"This show is 100% anti-God. The stars and galaxies so clearly demonstrate God's creation and awesome power, yet the scientist and producers of this show go out of thier way to deny Him. I literally got ill watching this show. I do not recommend it. The show 'God of Wonders' is SO much better. I would rate this show lower if possible."
5,Outstanding Documentary!!,"This is by far the best documentary out there I've seen that explains our cosmos and what we know up to date. The real images used for this are outstanding! Ive taken a few astronomy courses before and it just amazes me how much more we know now. This documentary not only explains our milky way galaxy in detail, but focuses on how the precision of modern astronomy allows researchers to understand how other galaxies fit into what we know as the visible cosmos."
4,"Product as described, great price with GoldBox Deal","Product works as described. Video quality is ok but, seems like it is an upscaled version and not recorded in native 1080p resolution.Other than the video quality, it is a very informative documentary for kids and adults."
2,wow.,"I don't really like this book, the writing style was ok and so was the illistrations. This would be a good ""just to read"" book for a little kid, like infant, maybe an embryo! Well this book was ok, just not the best."
3,I thought it was a Book.,"When I first opened the package I was disappointed, as it was only a 30 page booklet. However when I finished reading it I decided it was worth the purchase price, as it had lots of information I hadn't come across on the pomp and subsequent decline of a lost neighbourhood in Los Angeles."
2,An immediately suspect perspective,"For a work that implies an intimate knowledge of the Czech psyche, it is incomprehensible that the author places Czechs in ""Eastern"" Europe. Otherwise extremely reticent to correct foreigners in their mistakes, this is one area in which every Czech I know is crystal clear: They are CENTRAL Europeans. Prague is almost exactly the centre of Europe, geographically; but more than this, Czechs resent being classed with the Eastern European ""barbarians"" with whom they were forced for 40 years to share an ideology.Whether Mr. Roberts is oblivious, or simply insensitive, to this national sentiment, his lack of understanding heavily handicaps any credibility he may have had."
4,A Good Description of All You Wanted to Know about Czech Culture but Never Found Out,"I first ordered this book for myself, in preparation for a presentation I was giving on my experience as an American Grad Student in Prague. The book was helpful at jogging my memory about the highlights of Czech culture. It also contains excellent trivia that I would never have found out otherwise. I ended up ordering copies of the book for several of my friends who shared my experiences, and they have loved it too!"
3,"Well made, but too heavy to balance on top of pyrex measure cup","I wanted to use this to strain seeds out of lemon juice, and I normally do that over the pyrex glass one cup measuring cup that I will use to assemble the rest of the ingredients. This was fine with my old cheap strainer, which is very lightweight. This is a very nice strainer, but the handle is so heavy it will not stay on top of the container, so I will have to prop it up, or dangle a weight on the end, or something. It would probably stay on top of a wider vessel, but if I was using that, I would probably want a bigger strainer to pour through."
3,Wanted more,"I found this book very reassuring in many respects. It's good to know that it's great for mom and baby to keep exercising during pregnancy. I found his studies and all the science interesting. Still, I agree with other reviewers that I wanted more specific guidelines in terms of types of workouts, duration, intensity, etc. Basically, all I got in that arena was ""keep doing what you were doing before you got pregnant"" and ""if you feel bad, stop.""Also, he gave me high hopes that I would have my baby early if I kept exercising. That thought kept me going through many a workout near the end of my pregnancy. But, I'm going on 41 weeks and still counting, so don't count on it!!"
3,Good Information but not exactly what I wanted,"This book goes into great detail about the importance of exercise and proving that it is safe. However, it did not go into exercises that they do or do not recommend for pregnant woman. I feel that I still need another book to give me information on exercises to better prepare me for labor, for example."
5,Fabulous resource for athletic moms-to-be,"This is a great book for recreational and even professional athletes who want to better understand the science behind exercise and pregnancy, and want reassurance that exercising throughout a pregnancy is a very good thing indeed! If you're looking for specific workouts or types of exercises, you won't find it here (other than very general prescriptions for # times per week, intensity level, need for weight-bearing activities, etc.), but you will find a lot of useful data that will encourage you to keep moving as long as you can! Dr. Clapp's research is often cited in other books and publications -- it's great to have it all in one place and read it right from the source. A sanity saver for the athletic mom-to-be."
4,Very Informative,"Great information for those wanting to exercise through pregnancy. I exercised up until the morning I went to the hospital, and this book gave me peace of mind that I was doing the right thing. My labor went very well, and my doctor commented numerous times on how much being in good physical condition eases labor. My only drawback on this book is it does not give you any specific exercises, just information and research."
4,Exercising Through Your Pregnancy,"This is an excellent book for Mums To Be who arent sure about what forms of exercise are safe through pregnancy. It debunks some of the myths surrounding placing restrictions on exercise on pregnant mums and recommendations are made based on genuine research conducted.The book deals specifically with weight bearing excercise (eg. jogging) for non-exercisers, recreational athletes and professional athletes.Some caution should be maintained however as a lot of the recommendations made are based on Clapps own research which may be biased."
2,Not specific,This book provides a nice overview of exercising while pregnant but does not speak about specific exercises that can or cannot be done while pregnant. The book's advise is if it feels good it's probably ok. I did not find it helpful and plan on returning it.
1,"Grudgingly giving this book 1 star, don't waste your money","I bought this book looking for answers to things like, ""now that I'm pregnant should I continue with pilates? Can I keep lifting weights at the gym at the rate that I currently am? Are there any specific exercised that I should stay away from?"". I found this book ponderous. It read like a medical research findings report in a journal, not like a book and answered NONE of my questions. The psyisiology info was fine and if you are having to convince a spouse or family member that exercise is okay it might do that. Other than that it was worthless and I wish I could give it negative stars."
2,"Ah, I'd rather read something else",I feel as though I was looking for a book to confirm the fact that you can do more exercise during pregnancy. I am having my first baby in February and was very active before but have taken it a notch or two down because of all of the precautions out there. This book started out slow and it was painful to read at first but I do have to say that it made me a little more at ease about exercising but listening to your body is key. I think that is what it all comes down to and that is the rule I go by each day when i go to the gym.
4,"Oldies, but goodies","I really enjoy listening to this one.Songs I really liked: *Hi-Gate-Pitchin' and *Derb- Derb both because of the progression, *Sono-Keep Control because it's an all-around good song with good vocals, *Massiv-Who Am I because of the good ""old school rave"" feel it gives me when I listen, *Laut Sprecher-Omnibus even though it reminds me a little too much of Darude's Sandstorm, I love how it drops everything in the middle of the song then slowly progresses back up to the original beat. Gives me MAJOR goosies! Everything else on this cd was good, classic stuff, too.The only song that I can't stand hearing is Phat Bass. There's not even any bass in the song! You think it's going to build up to this awesome bassline, but all you get is some cheesy synth notes. It's the cheesiest song I've ever heard because of that."
2,get a 10-foot pole ready...,"Unmixed, unfiltered, unrefined. This CD is good for all those of you that would get into this music if only it was on MTV. So, for all you popularity-seeking folk out there...buy up! Better yet, leech money off your parents and have THEM buy it! The rest of us (the people that actually listen to trance because we LIKE it) are busy saving up for Exposure 4, or Airdrawndagger."
2,"For being such a new Cd, the songs are sure as hell old.","They seemed to have put those old...annoying songs on this albulm and called it house. I don't think so. Although there are a couple tunes i consider house and that are actually good such as Sono's tune ""keep control."" As for the rest the music on this disc, what else can I say, PLAYED OUT."
2,This book is marginally slightly somewhat helpful,"This book is old, I'll tell you that part upfront. The pictures, while in abudance, are very grainy and in a dark black & white format.The instructions are not for a novice or a beginner. IE... pretty generic instructions. ""Disconnect the fuel gauge sending unit and fuel line."" No pictures... no explaination where it's at exactly.The diagrams and mustang info in the back are the saving grace. Nice reference materials.I'd not recommend it for a person not already knowing how to do all the work. It's just a guide on what order to do stuff in. It doesn't teach how to do the work itself."
2,Lasted about 8 months,"This latch is a good product, but I would not recommend it for outdoor use. If you have a foyer or some other area with a covered door / porch, I believe it would serve well. I used it exclusively in an outdoor setting with no covering over the door, and the rubber for the pushbutton degraded enough in 8 months for the metal pushrod to pierce the button - rendering it useless. The rubber on the handle also attracts a lot of dirt."
2,A small quantity of attempted humor,"I was expecting something along the lines of Hartston's ""How to Cheat at Chess"", which is hilarious. Instead, this book is a tiny, 64-page treatise whose stated purpose is to establish, for the non-chess player, the appearance of knowledge through buzzwords and short stories. There are brief (2-page) biographies of a couple of dozen historical and present-day chess figures. The first is Alexander Alekhine, whose emigration from Russia to France brings out the worst of the author's racism: ""To be born French may be accounted ill luck, but to enter into it voluntarily is depravity of a high order...."" Come on. But there is some genuine humor on the next page, when he describes Alekhine's Defense (1...Nf6) as ""the chess equivalent of hormone weedkiller, stimulating White into such a frenzy of development that he would outgrow his own strength and collapse."" The best feature of this book is its low price. You might want to order it along with something else."
4,Impressive album,"Post Hardcore, emotional punk played real nice. This is a pretty good CD, it has it's driving moments, it's slower moments, and all around it has many fine moments. If you have stumbled onto this album, chances are it was not a mistake, so just hit that add to cart button."
3,Photo Quality,"First off, this book is not a hardcover as advertised. It's a legal size paperback. The photos would have made the book but they were blurred and extremely poorly replicated. The photo collection and newspaper shots looked like good choices. I only wish I could have see them clearly."
1,"All Whining, All the time -- we're British","""Lord Gnome's Literary Companion"" is funny and terribly witty and maybe even serves a purpose though I'm not sure what. But after a few minutes of slogging through the huffy sarcasm and personal attacks against succesful authors, you do start to get the feeling that there's more going on here than the need to deflate egos. It's obvious that for the anonymous critics it's so much easier to be clever than to actually say something or even attempt to. In other words it's easier to write an anonymous personal attack, laid thick with cynicism, nihilism, jealousy, hostility and aggression than it is to attempt an actual meaningful work of art. So here the 'writers' of Lord Gnome's companion prove the point that it's not so easy this writing business, is it. If it was then that's what we'd be doing instead of slinging crud anonymously. Because you know what boys, a so-called critique is not really art."
5,Timely Message,"I tend to be very critical of books about Christ and the believer's identity in Him. Far too often the information and teachings contained between the covers lack not only real substance but also are fraught with inaccuracies, omissions, and sometimes, are even filled with downright lies. In today's world people are broadsided by the seemingly endless fads and foibles of the academy; secular humanism and alternative lifestyles confuse, distract, and ultimately destroy lives by providing ""feel good"" answers to problems that can only be fixed or healed by Christ. Preston unabashedly addresses the importance of God's love - how it is constant and never-ending - and what a profound impact Grace has already had on the believer's life no matter what circumstances they find themselves in. I highly recommend Pres' work.-------------(...)"
5,One of the Best slips offered,"I love this half slip. I had searched for a half slip for years from many manufacturers, catalogs, stores. This half slip is the right quality for me and I appreciate the company that sells it."
5,Kevin shines on,"I don't think I have read a Kevin O'Brien book that I did not like. One always better than the next, and this is no exception. Good plot"
3,Okay,"This is my first Kevin O'Brien novel and while it was an exciting read, it had a rather predictable ending. Alpha male, Brad Corrigan, is running for state Senate in Oregon with the help of his twin sister Bridget who works as his campaign manager. However, the twins have a deep dark secret from high school that they share with a few other students that will doom his campaign if it is ever made public. However, a few of their friends involved in this secret are suddenly getting killed. Characters in this one are somewhat shallow and a typical reader cannot identify with any of them. I'll give one of his other novels a try before I judge Mr. O'Brien too harshly."
3,What is going on with O'Brien?,"I am a big fan of Kevin O'Brien's books. He has a way of writing that keeps you on the edge of your seat.However, the Last Victim just did not hit the mark at all. The storyline itself (twins - one running for office - the other going around trying to make things all better) is boring. Yep, O'Brien has committed the ultimate sin. He wrote a BORING thriller.Last Victim just does not feel as though it gets off the ground at all. There are just pages and pages of pointless dialogue and I just could not get into liking any of the main characters. The sister was supposed to be ""strong female"" lead and really her role ended up being more that of ""house cleaner and making sure all is perfect"" for her almost famous brother.O'Brien's previous book left me cold also. I am worried that this is becoming his new writing style. Bring back the old style please."
4,Good pusher,We use these pushers to shovel entrance ways and walk ways on our campus. The crew loves them and we have been getting them for the last three years. We do only get one year of use out of them because they don't have the steel cutting edge. Without the steel edge they glide over the concrette without catching.
1,For die hard Livermore fans only,"Sarnoff does not like Jesse Livermore and it shows in the book. He does very little research and the resulting picture is two dimensional and very thin.Unfortunately, since there is so little material about Mr. Livermore, you may want to read it if you have already read ""Reminiscences of a Stock Operator"" and ""How to Trade in Stocks.""I also hear Trader's Press is coming out with a new biography of him this month."
1,Sarnoff didn't know what he was talking about,"Just an example which proved that Sarnoff didn't know his topic a thing before he commented on it. Regarding ""The Livermore Key"" in Livermore's book ""How to trade in stocks"", the numbers in the price table, Sarnoff said ""He (Livermore) used blue ink for the upward movements, and red ink for the downward"". In fact, Livermore use BLACK ink for upward trend, and red ink for downward trend. Blue ink (pencil) was used for Rally or Reaction which can be upward or downward. I don't think Sarnoff understood the formula Livermore talked about."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK,THIS BOOK CUTS THROUGH THE MYTH AND BUNK OF LIVERMORE AND RECOLLECTIONS OF A STOCK OPERATOR. LIVERMORE LIVED LIKE A KING AND DIED BROKE BY SUICIDE. TELLS THE HONEST TRUTH ABOUT SPECULATING IN STOCKS AND TELLS HOW EVEN STOCK MASTERS CAN LOSE THEIR SHIRTS.
4,Tales Have Good Surprise Endings,"I ended up liking this DVD because each story have a surprise ending that makes the story satisfying and suspense along the way was worth it. Victoria Principal looks fabulous, for someone not in her 20s or 30s (though I don't know how old she's here), and I had hoped to see some nudity but there wasn't any. But she did pretty good being leading role in each tale."
3,Good Stuff,"I bought this book as a gift and they love it. It has lots of fruit, veg, and smoked salsas. They use it a lot."
1,Dumb Movie,I watched this movie and talk about stupid the movie had no substance . And anyone who finds it funny ( Hello come back to earth )Its a boring goofy movie !
1,SCARY!!!,"I bought this film because of all the good reviews it received on here. But you know what, I have to say this is the most disturbing film I've ever seen in my life. I was looking for a cute film showing homosexuality in a positive light, but what I got instead was a creepy film that left me wondering if it was filled with subliminal messages. Just the way color was used throughout the film bothered me. All in all, I watched it once, then promptly took it outside to the dumpster so I'd never have to see it again. I gave it a one star rating because they wouldn't let me give it any less, but if I had the choice it would get nothing more than a negative 10. I would never ever suggest this movie to anyone and I think it could possibly be used as a torture device."
1,'but' this movie sucks!,Natasha Lyonne should have never agreed to be in this super low-brow gay-themed romantic-comedy that takes bad taste to a whole new level. Not recommended.
1,Boring,This was a really boring movie which we turned off after 20 minutes. Worst movie we have seen in a long time.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY...,this movie is from a homophobic straight point of view or wriiten by an immature individual. it is dry the whole way thru and tasteless. i could not finish without vomitting. from the DVD player to the trash it went. if it were sold for a cent it would not be worth it!
1,Let's Be Honest Here!!,"It's funny how EVERYONE misses the point about how dumb and misguided this film turns out to be - for years the gay/lesbian argument has been that homosexuality is a genetic pre-desposition, instead of a conscious choice; therefore, straights don't have to worry about being TURNED gay! And this movie starts out with a great idea, how fear and prejudice make the perfectly normal lead character to be sent to a 'Gay-Curing' camp. However - and this IS THE POINT FOLKS - when she gets there and is thrown together with a lesbian, the lesbian TURNS HER GAY!!! What a horrible message that is 180 degrees opposite of what the gay community has been trying to project. If the filmmakers had stuck with the original premise it might have been watchable, however the confused and wrongheaded direction it takes makes it a true waste of 91 minutes of your life. Don't bother!"
3,"Is she or isn't she, that is the question","I wasn't really that keen on this one. Just a rehab spoof full of homosexual stereotypes. But after seeing the way her hot shot quarterback boyfriend kisses, that alone would be enough to drive her into the arms of another woman! Was that a make out session or a face washing?"
4,Summer Campy,"This is a terrific movie. It mocks people who try and cure gay people. It mocks the family members of gay folks who send them to be cured. It's slightly sarcartic and extremely over-the-top... and absolutely hysterical.I wasn't quite sure, when I first saw it, if it was quite my sort of movie; the scenes can be very spartan at times, despite the pink PVC clothing. But after I'd seen the whole thing I decided I liked it quite a bit."
3,Fabulous!,"I thought this was a fun film. It was a promising comedy, however contrary to what the Editorial Review states ""that goes awry too early"", I think the film does deliver. The film deals with difficult subject matter and it does so with the finesse of a rubber chicken. ""But I'm a Cheerleader"" is a coming of age story with a twist. The acting is fantastic. Sure, sometimes the story is a little absurd, but it can't be any more absurd than real life bigotry and homophobia.Outside of all the politically correct stuff, it is a good film about first love, being yourself and following your heart. I recommend it!"
4,Best Gay Comedy of 20th Century,"This is funniest and light-hearted comdey that is not overly cheesy or degrading. Its cute, charming and watchable. Just a typical love story that involves gay and lesbian charachters. Nothing too serious is laid out, but it doesnt take away from the film. One of the sincerist gay comedies ever made."
3,"Cute, Fluffy, Funny at times","This is not a bad movie to watch with a few friends. The characters were shallow, but hey, this is entertainment. A few funny moments. I laughed when the girl you think is the stereotypical lesbian blurts out something to reveal she's not. And the guy who is kicked out of the gay to straight program because he is too gay. It is worth renting, or buying a used copy."
4,Good Lesbian Satire,"This movie does a great job at showing the stereotypes of the LGBTQ community. The main girl's family believes she is a lesbian, even though she does not, and they send her to a camp which is aimed at reversing gay tendencies. While she is there she really does realize her orientation and falls in love with one of the other female inmates. I bet that wasn't what the parents had in mind!"
3,Very funny!,"This is a great film. I had seen it before and really liked it, do I decided to get it. I'm glad I found it on amazon, and at a great price too!"
3,"Funny, But Lacking","Reasons to see this movie: If you're looking for some light comedy, this movie will delivers. It's not hilarious and probably won't have you doubled over, but it'll certainly make you laugh. Additionally, it has a nice message about not being ashamed of who you are.Reasons not to see this movie: The real problem with this film results from what I've listed above. The movie wants us to laugh at a bunch of stereotypical gay figures who aren't given much depth and at the same time leave the viewer with more understanding of gays and lesbians - something it doesn't really accomplish.Overall: It works as light comedy, but it wants to have its cake and eat it, too. It could've done much more as a drama if it hadn't relied so much on gay stereotypes."
5,But I'm Straight,"I was only lucky that I happened to see the episode of Ebert and Roper where they reviewed this film. Or eles I still might not have seen this wonderful movie. It made me smile at every moument and the love story was very beutiful. I'm actually a straight guy, which I am not say becasue I'm insicure, just to piont out that I was probly the opposite of the audience Jamie Babbitt was try to appeal to. The film was just so well made. I knew after watching this film I had to own it. The movie was very funny and at the same time made a good point about love and just being different. It also outdoes most teen movie ... you see out there (like American Pie and Save the Last Dance). It just makes me happy to watch it and if you have not seem it, you must rent or buy it as soon as possible. You have my garenty."
5,Hilarious!,"Charming, heartwarming, and funny story. Aside from being a goofy, fun love story, it also takes a look at prejudice against homosexuals in our society and one of the techniques people use to change homosexuals--rehabilitation centers. These centers are supposed to change who gay people are attracted to, as if there is something wrong with how and who they choose to love. But I'm A Cheerleader shows us that homosexuality is not just about sex--no, gay people love and have deep, meaningful relationships just as straight people do and deserve equal rights."
5,"As has been mentioned, it's a SATIRE, people.","It's actually not just a light-hearted silly comedy-- as my ex pointed out to me ""Did you ever notice how only the gay characters wear any color?"" Everything is brown and drab green but the clothes and surroundings of the queer characters."
4,"Eh: Kind of corny, but opened my mind","I first saw this movie a year ago, and, well, I had to rent it again. No mean feat let me tell you with no Blockbuster Card and two fairly homophobic parents. However, I still like it, and once I can buy movies without them knowing, this one will be on my shelf.Complaints: There are a few. The plot is cheesy, the music is horribly cliche, and the characters are so incredibly stereotypical it's almost embarassing.Praises: Proof for questioning people (like myself) that despite what parents may think, being gay is not wrong. Plus, it stars Clea Duvall!This movie needs to be taken with a grain of salt. It is very corny, but then again, its basically a gay chic-flick. If you want a laugh, especially if you're a lesbian, then I suggest it."
5,It has... rue paul charles... that alone should be worth buying.,"Its cliche, silly, and considering this is supposedly about teens most looked rather old, especially megan. but all that aside, this movie owns.yes, yes it owns. It's hilariously funny, and even has Bull the bailiff guy from night court in it... O and a cameo from Dante Basco. Basco is the guy who played rufio in the movie hook! o c'mon, rufio making out with guys, now didnt see that one coming. but this movie is hilarious. this is a must own for anyone who isnt scared of a few man kisses, or non-porn lesbian scenes."
4,Excellent,"I severely enjoyed this movie-- I don't know how to put it better than that. The acting was good, not amazing, but good. The plot was funny, realistic and cute. Also, bonus points for an amazing soundtrack."
4,"An anachronistic spin on homosexuality, with humor","I was shocked that I had never even heard of this movie. The film itself is difficult to describe. The main character, a cheerleader, has been fantacizing about her fellow cheerleaders. She has been considered a lesbian by her family and friends, so they decide to send her to a camp called ""True Directions"" (the recruiter being RuPaul). Both the male and female homosexuals of the group at ""True Directions"" are your cliché lesbians and gays. The humor lies in the anachronism of a plot; these clichés; the therapies involved; the colors used symbolically. For example, the boys must learn how to fix automobiles and chop wood to learn their gender roles, while the girls have to learn how to change diapers and vacuum. The entire time, both sexes are fantasizing about their co-campers of the same sex and it is obvious that the therapy is not working.The end is a bit rushed and pointless, but overall the entertainment value was high."
4,Insecure heterosexuals will be offended,"This movie is a less than common mix of ridiculous humor and seriousness. The humor is dominant due to the overall atmosphere.The main character is suspected of being a lesbian by her parents because she listens to Melissa Ethridge and displays other ""signs."" They send her off to anti-gay camp where she finds love and her true self.While most reviewers seem to get ""the right idea,"" the movie is not as clear as it could have been and lets some people walk away with the idea that people ""become"" lesbians.A lot of the movie's jokes play off of stereotypes, even though the gay characters (male or female) in the movie have a wide range of personalities. This has the potential to create the logically ironic, yet perplexingly common, situation in which members of the majority get ""offended"" on behalf of the minority..."
4,A funny movie,"This is a quirky movie that is a lot of fun. The story centers around a young woman who has no idea she is a lesbian. Her parents, horrified by the idea, send her to a camp run by a woman that makes Joan Crawford look weak (played by Cathy Moriarity). The film maker gives us all of the stereotypes applied to gay people and uses humor to show the ignorance that perpuates these stereotypes. Eddie Cibrian, of tv's ""Third Watch"", plays the obviously gay son of Moriarity and RuPaul is in charge of making men out of the boys that come to the camp. Speaking of camp, this film is full of it and that is they way it should be taken. Campy, silly and funny."
2,Good idea - but not clever enough,"It seems that reviewers either loved or hated this one. Well, the idea is clever - parents send their daughter, who doesn't realize that she has gay tendencies - to a special school to try to get on the straight and narrow. The idea backfires - in a house full of gay teenagers, she falls in love. The cast is also charming. Yet for me the movie fails, since it is just too exagerrated to be funny. Although the idea in general is believable, everything about the execution is just way too over the top. The general idea of this film was handled much better in In and Out, which had believable characters, a generally believable plot, and much more humor. The school was just too unrealistic for me - and the day-glo fiftyish costumes just added to this."
2,A real let-down,"I have to say I really expected way more out of this movie. It doesn't know which way to go. Cathy Moriarty should have played it like she did in Soapdish, at least we'd have enjoiyed her. I am not an expert on Natasha Lyonne's acting, but I couldn't understand what kind of person she was. She's always out it, making strange faces which points to the direction of ""I hate everything here"" but then when she sees two boys making out on the floor, she screams and after that she is like a against the groups AND the camp people. so what's up? I got the same feeling from ""There's Something About Mary"" it was not funny. It's like they put in scenes that have a very potential funny element in them, but it's like the directors don't want to make them funny or whatever they are supposed to be, so the whole thing leaves you with a sour taste in your mouth.This movie is like a flat line. What could have been...."
3,Could Send Anyone Back Into The Closet.,Funny...yes. Stereo-typical...yes. Eye Candy for both sexes...yes. Story...no. Acting...no. Cinematography...no.Direction...YOU'RE JOKING...RIGHT? Best of show...Eddie Cibrian. Taking No Guffman...Cathy Moriarty. A Mighty Wind...Natasha Lyonne. The John Waters School Of Acting...RuPaul Charles. I really shouldn't be rooting for this fluffy candy soufle....BUT I'M A CHEERLEADER!!!!!!
5,Funny,"This is a delightful movie which pokes at stereotypes, especially about gays. The protagonist is a cheerleader with a boyfriend, but her family and friends suspect she might be a lesbian, so send her to this weird camp that is supposed to make people straight. I loved Dante Basco in this film, and the movie pokes fun at these 'make you straight' camps and soes a nice job showing different gays and how they had to deal with their sexuality."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A sometimes cutting, mostly just cute lesbian variation on the teen flick, But I'm a Cheerleader is diverting but not especially good."
4,Funny movie .,"When it started , like all movies it was interesting and fun to learn about the actors . When you hit in the middle of the movie it seems to have lost direction and you find yourself waiting for something to happen . The movie has its funny parts and all the people involved in the movie are great at their part .My favorite part was when the family/friends had the meeting and how they acted . The way the mom said what she had and blurted it out was funny .This movie is good and great to see with friends and just chill."
5,Fabulous,"This is a fabulous, quirky, 50s-motif gay comedy. The cast, art direction, and soundtrack is great. It's a very happy, sexy film that leaves you satisfied."
2,touchstones,"The book was listed in good condition.but it had a big coffee stain along the vertical closed page side of the book, meaning i have to look at it each time i use the book, ugly.also many pages were crumpled and crushed inward between the covers and i had to unfold each one but they are still wrinkly.i was looking forward to getting this book and was dissapointed at its condition. i obviously buy used books with an open mind but based on its description i expected better than what i got.i do not like giving this review but i am very surprised that the seller sent this on to me, per advertised condition. based on other reviews, that i read beforehand, maybe it was a mistake.if they see this review, I hope they will be willing to send me a better copy along with pre-paid postage so that i can return the damaged copy and i will write an updated review."
4,Uplifting and relevant book,This is an uplifting and relevant book for those that like to read a little at a time. Daily meditations is a great way to start the day!
5,Excellent daily words for men!,This book is worth it's weight in gold. Spiritually meaningful for men and will give your days a positive trajectory.
5,Wonderful and comforting,"As always, Ms Northrup has written a wonderfully fulfilling and heart warming book! She helps us to look at our lives and those of our mothers and grandmothers in a new and comforting way. Your mind and soul will be eased of its pain and conflicts with past memories and/or experiences. It will help you to heal yourself and forgive both yourself and the women that came before you that left an impact on you and your life. I highly recommend this wonderful book for you, your mom and daughters!"
2,Mother Daughter Wisdom,"Don't buy any of Dr. Northrup's books. She believes in using astrology and tarrot cards to diagnose illness. At one time, I respected her as a cutting edge doctor of alternative therapies. Now in my book she is nothing but a quack. She also also turned into a huckster of various products on her website. At one time, her website was a place where anyone could get free health information. Now she had redesigned it so that only people who subscribe to her newsletter can get quality health information. She has become a huge disappoinment. If you want quality alternative health information go to Dr. Andrew Weil or Dr. Ronald Hoffman's websites. They are the gold standard on alternative medicine therapies. And they don't use tarrot cards to diagnose illness."
3,This one is okay but geared more to bio moms,This book is not quite as good as I had hoped. I really appreciated Northrup's Menopause Wisdom more. She does try to include the experiences of women who don't have children and women who became mothers through adoption but the analysis is mostly focused on women who are biological daughters and mothers of daughters.
2,not what i wanted,it is not what i wanted. i wanted more adult relationships. a little late to deal with 50 year old daughters.
4,Interesting!,"My sister in law suggested I read this, and it was really interesting! I learned a lot more than I thought I would. I would suggest this for any woman!"
1,"Cliches, platitudes and old chestnuts","As mother of two teenagers, I had high hopes for this book, but I almost gagged on the number of trite sayings this author can cram into a paragraph. You will find ""great"" insights like: mothers are very important in an infant's life, two year olds are announcing their independence, and it's important to keep channels of communication open with your daughter even when things aren't going smoothly. And I paid how much money to learn THAT??If you have had your eyes and ears open for any length of time, you will find nothing new in this book. It is all hype and marketing with no substance. And wisdom? That's the biggest hype of all.Save your money and just go talk to your daughter."
5,A Kingsnake owners guide..,"If you like, own or are considering buying a California Mountain Kingsnake then this is a fine book to get started with. It tells you how to look after them, from general care to breeding and has some great pictures of the different types."
4,underated 60's garage punk album,"The Standells were one of several hundred (thousand?) garage bands that sprung up in the mid to late sixties. However, unlike a lot of these bands, the Standells actually released several albums. This one is their best and actually holds up quite well. The Standells don't pummel you with fuzz guitars and are not overly psychedelic, they just write great songs. This album contains two hits-Why pick on me and Good Guys don't wear black. Both are essential garage punk anthems of the era. Many other songs are minor keyed and have a moody menacing feel. The group also covers the Stone's Paint it Black and Love's My Little Red Book. Both are done quite well. Only a few clunkers on the album prevent it from being a 5 star record. Anyone interested in 60's garage bands or 60's music in general should buy this album."
3,Straightforward Fitness Hints,"The book has a picturesque cover of Captain Midnight, executed by a comic-book artist. Its contents, with line drawings to illustrate, show both exercises and some of the rules of various games (e.g., volleyball). There are even instructions for relaxation included (meditation).The book is ambitious, but it cannot, by its very nature, go into the fine details of each sport. However, it might be a good introduction to various sports for younger readers."
2,"Not as pictured, and no markings","There are fewer pleats (less surface area) than my original filter, and it doesn't look anything like the pictures, and it has no marking to indicate the merv rating so you really don't know what you have. I was going to send them back but I decided to use them instead, like they say you get what you pay for."
2,Not the best,"I absolutely love Smashmouth. I think they are one of the most talented groups out there today. Unfortunately, however, I can't say I liked their newest album. If you don't own any other Smashmouth albums, make one of their earlier ones your first buy. Make sure you hear the songs on this album before you buy it...I'm not too crazy about it. It just seems as if the songs were written in haste and lack the quality that was seen in Astro Lounge (which is one of my favorites, if not my absolute favite album)."
4,Smash Mouth keeps on POPing,"Well Smash Mouth has done it again. They put out an album that will tear up the radio! Smash Mouth is the best band on the face of the earth! This new album is not one of their best but still has some rockin tunes. Nothing can compare to their debut album, ""Fush Yu Mang"". Smash Mouth has gone with the theme these days and gone a little too pop for my liking but the songs on ""Get The Picture"" still rock. Songs like ""Hot"", ""105"", ""Hang On"" and ""Always Gets Her Way"" make you want to blast the radio and cruise down the coast with the convertible top down. All in all this album is defently worth the money and is one that you can just put on repeat and not get bored."
1,Smash Mouth,"I am a huge fan of Smash Mouth, well I guess I should say was a fan. Their first two albums were great, then they went downhill from there and it just keeps getting worse. I don't recommend this."
1,WHAT???,"I can't BELIEVE all the 5 star reviews! I have 3 words to describe this album, EL GRANDE LAME-O!"
4,"It was good, but...","I liked this roerd, but I'm a Van Halen chick, so naturally I like Fush Yu Mang batter. ACtually, the writing is MUCH better than it has been in the pasr, but it's so..POP. Well, I have a copy, but I have to reccommend Fush Yu Mang and East Bay Sessions over this record. PS I LOVE PAUL."
4,In Heavy Rotation In My Transportation,"Perfect summer music for driving to the beach with the top down. And, if you time the drive right, you can be cheered up by listening to ""105"" just as the traffic's getting reeeeally bad.It's great to hear Ranking Roger's guest starring vocal on ""You Are My Number One,"" as I've always been a fan of the English Beat and can hear their ska influence bright as day in Smashmouth.I agree with the other reviewer who said there are somme cuts that could have fit nicely on Astro Lounge, like Space Man, which is one of my favorite tracks.Stop browsing, already. Click <Add to Cart>!"
4,Hot hot hot,"This CD was a pretty good cd although I don't really like how they put the remix of you are my number one on it. Overall the album is pure smashmouth sound with my favorite song being ""Hot."" If you like their other albums, this one is sure to please you!"
4,a better one,when i first listened to smash mouth back in 97' i was happily surprised to find the amount of different styles and genres they were able to play. since then they have obviously changed their style to suit todays audience which doesnt appeal to me however their new album has re-enriched my love for them. stay away from mainstream hip hop smash mouth.. you kick arse
1,look elsewhere,"Reading this book is a waste of time. If I thought I could get my money back I would. My first clue should have been that the book was self published. Lynch was successful with his Strategy of the Dolphin. It would seem that some publisher would want to pick this one up if it were at least mediocre.Lynch refers to the Graves material as the foundation for this book. I have been studying and working with Grave's material for several years. I have had training from both Beck and Cowan, and use it in my work and life. In my opinion, this book does not suggest anything more than that Lynch may have met Graves.The Mother of all Minds is a catchy title, and my expectation was that something of substance would be presented. However, this book doesn't do that."
4,I'm gonna take you surfin' with me,"This is the first album by prolific surf music band the Challengers. Not only is it the Challengers first album, it is also the first all-instumental surf album ever. (Dick Dale had released a surf album before this, but it contained a few vocal songs). On this album, the Challengers play excellent cover versions of popular instrumentals of the time period. Some of the artists covered more than once here are: the Fireballs, Dick Dale, Duane Eddy and the Bel-Airs. It's interesting to note that the Challengers were lead by Richard Delvy, the drummer from the Bel-Airs. He formed the Challengers after the Bel-Airs broke up. This album is a lot of fun, and I would recommend it to all surf music fans."
1,Stick with the sheets!,More than half of the micro mesh pads had illegible grit size inked on. They also seemed to do a poor job of final sanding compared to the sheets.
4,Cheers!,"This was a refreshing, contemporary approach to the genre. In years of reading Vampire fiction, I've never encountered a serious attempt to discuss issues of race in the US. Aside from that broad theme, I thought the characters were consistently and convincingly portrayed, and the graphic violence was used to great effect in conveying the beastly nature of the Vampires, and sometimes, of humans. This was an incredibly ambitious piece in a remarkably white genre, and I applaud both the efforts and results on the part of author Lucien Soulban (Yes, his real name apparently)."
1,Blech,"Wow. I was so excited to read this because of the first book in the series really knocking my socks off. But... how to describe the disappointment, the massive let-down that is Blood In, Blood Out. It just sucks balls is all."
2,"Good cuz it's Vampire, Bad for everything else","This one is a real let down after ""Hunger like Fire."" If you're confident in your ability to trudge through a novel for the sake of minimal continuity, then go for it. If you'd rather just skip this one and move on to ""Marriage of Virtue and Visciousness,"" then you really won't miss much story. I'm not familiar with Lucien Soulban's other work, but I hope White Wolf keeps him away from their projects for a bit.Don't despair though, the 3rd novel in the series redeems it, though I still enjoyed the first one a little bit more."
1,Just boring,"After reading the first of the new Requiem novels (A Hunger Like Fire), I couldn't wait to continue reading the series. Lucien Soulban quickly killed that desire. The characters seem so flat and boring that I just couldn't force myself to finish the book. If you liked the first Requiem Novel, you might as well skip this one and move on to the next."
3,"Used to be a favorite, until Platinum came along","This used to be my go-to. Until I decided to try Wet Platinum. I could never go back to Wet Light. In fact I have tried, when I was out of the Platinum, and it was not as good as it used to be, even bothersome. I loved Wet Light for years but once I have tried the Platinum I could never go back."
5,Sensational.,All the reasons you seek out version after version of Rimsky's fever dreams are met in this startling rendering. Intoxicating perfume.
1,Stop working intermittenly after two months,"Very disappointed with Casio, this is the first watch from Casio out of five previous ones to just stop working so unpredictably. I only had it for two months before I noticed that the time is off every so often."
3,"decent watch, disposable band","The watch is of good quality, keeps time well, and keeps functioning despite my abuse to it.However, the band will ""skunk"" like a gym sock after a few weeks. I have had three of these watches, and the original bands last about 3 months.The watches are pretty good if you are willing to invest the time to replace the bands with plastic or rubber replacement straps.I bought a 4$ rubber strap to replace the cloth when it fails, and the rubber strap will last about a year..."
3,Forester Watch,"Pro: Looks nice, easy to read, keeps good time, lights up well at night. Velcro strap is relatively convenientCons: Mostly plastic. Plastic case, plastic crystal. Easily scratches.I doubt it will last as long as similarly priced Timex watches. I would not have bought if I saw it physically first, or buy again."
3,"An early performance, perhaps best by mp3","The performance dates to 1965 and was not issued until 2004. It is a series of very short pieces that, for me, do not form a coherent or even enjoyable whole. My comment has nothing to do with the playing, but to my reaction to some of the works, particularly the three Paganini Caprices that open the CD. This CD is the perfect reason for MP3 files and just buying and downloading the tracks of interest. For example I could listen to this performance of the Manuel de Falla's Spanish Dance No 1 any number of times and the Ernest Bloch Nigun (Baal Shem no 2) was wonderful."
1,Very disappointed!,I bought this last Christmas as a gift for my husband because he adores cheese and I'd had it with those ridiculous little wire cutters. It got hidden away in the drawer for about six months because he forgot about it but when he finally started using it he loved it. About a month ago it snapped in half. The top portion just snapped right out of the handle - not fixable. We were both really disappointed as we expected Henckels would have produced a better product. I went with this one in particular because all of our other knives are Henckels and we've had good luck. Will not be purchasing this product again...now I'm trying to find another one that will last!
1,Is 1 star too generous?,"I bought this without looking at the reviews first. Big mistake. Just like the others, my plane has snapped off where the neck meets the handle. This took about a month of occasional use. It seems this cheese plane was designed primarily for slicing cream cheese, and even then only if the cheese is warm.Before it broke, it almost sort of worked ok... at best. The serrated edge is a terrible idea which makes it very hard to make thin slices which don't break. It also makes the plane a real pain to clean, because anything you wipe it with will get caught up in the serrations.That said, this cheese plane never killed anybody, does not kick puppies, has not appreciably warmed the environment, and never once insulted my mother. It is this combination of characteristics which have earned the product the one star I'm giving it, as limiting this review strictly to the realm of intended use would have left it with none."
1,FAKE,"I have gotten this eye liner directly from the Chanel website and absolutely loved it.Unfortunately it was discontinued when I needed to re-order - I was thrilled to find it here.I was so disappointed the first time I used it - it flaked all over my eyes, my cheeks and the rest of my face. Now, since I had purchased before I knew this did NOT happen with the product directly from Chanel so I can only discern that this product is NOT what it claims to be.I wanted to give it a second chance, and a third..both times it still continued to flake and by mid-day my eyes were a mess - so not the quality of true chanel style.ONLY BUY FROM DIRECTLY FROM CHANEL.So bummed..."
5,Excellent!,This product was discontinued for a long time and I am so glad it is back! The best eyeliner ever....
2,walker was too short after a while,"I liked the walker at first because all four wheels pivot and help the baby move around, but my daughter was able to get out once she became taller. The walker doesn't go up high enough like some of the others."
4,Great for the smaller baby!,This walker is great for the smaller baby! My 6 month old daughter is only 25 1/4 in. and I couldn't find a walker that she could reach the floor in. This 1 is perfect. It's also light and not as bulky as others making storage easier.
3,Not tall enough,I agree with the other reviews and should have read them before purchasing. My son is 6 months old in the 75 percentile & is just about maxed out for this. It is a good basic walker if your baby is on the shorter side though.
1,Should have been half the price!,"This walker is a no frills item, but it lacks in safety. The seat doesn't lock down well, so my baby could easily fall through the hole. It doesn't height adjust well or fold up well either. Definetly not worth it!!"
1,Not tall enough,"My daughter liked this walker at first, but she quickly grew too tall for it. We ended up buying another walker that was taller and has buttons and sounds to it which she loves."
4,Powerful Exciting Tingling,What a story!!! I've read Harris' 3 books and I liked this one best. The action starts on the first page. I liked how Harris created real characters that have real lives and face the same issues and problems I do.There's a good mixture of romance and suspense.
4,Great people as the characters,I like authors who write the same characters from book to book. Harris introduced an additional one this time - Kristin - her own person. I read for enjoyment and Harris has captured my interest. She did a great job developing the plot from page one. I spent two nights well past my bedtime reading do i could finish it. On to the third book by Harris.
5,It moved from page one until the end,I read the first book THE CAPTAIN's FUND and enjoyed it so I ordered this one. SMOLDERING got you into the police investigation right in the beginning. Harris keeps you informed throughout the story. You want to turn the pages to learn what's going on. Her writing style is easy and comfortable.
4,Well written,This one is set on Cape Cod. Harris included the same characters that were in her first book - I like that. I found out more about them. harris has a good combination of romance and good old fashioned police work.
5,Great book for a relaxing weekend,The words flowed so easily and the story is fascinating. I finished it during a weekend and passed it along to a friend. Harris keeps the same charaters in each of her three books which I happen to like.
4,This series gets better with each book,"Fast, well written and I enjoyed the characters... that's what i want to say about SMOLDERING. Harris gives you enough clues and description to make the book enjoyable and not overwhelming. Harris writed about the same people in each of her books, which adds to the charm. Her police investigation keeps the book moving forward."
4,Good weekend read,"I picked up the book and didn't put it down until I finished. I thought I had figured out ""who"" unitl I was surprised at the end. I really liked the cover and was amazed that a high school junior designed it. Read the story - it moves."
3,Light and easy reading,"I really like Harris's style. This is the second of her books that I read and I finished it in one day. I love the summer because I can sit at the beach and read. Harris has created wonderful characters which she has in each book. If you like fast paced, interesting stories read harris."
5,Great story!!!,I liked the fast pace. It kept me reading well into the night on several occasions. I select authors who write about the same characters in all their books. I feel that I get to know them. Harris created several life like people in her stories.I also like how Harris mixes romance in with a great police investigation.
5,Mary Summer Rain Delivers Again,"Since reading Seventh Mesa, I have waited for another novel from Mary Summer Rain and in Ruby, she doesn't disappoint. Ruby was light hearted, fun and easy to read. My attention was rooted as Mary so eloquently drew me into the lives of her characters and inspired me to see the best of myself through them. Ruby is an inspirational story that is especially timely right now as our world looks to the question of life and death and what that means to us individually and collectively. Ruby explores the larger questions with the fun and wit that only Mary Summer Rain has consistently shown she can deliver. She takes us on a journey of self discovery along with the willingness to explore what that might be like if we stop long enough to observe a world we may not have witnessed before because of our preconceived notions or just the busyness of life filling our time. What if we saw people as they are rather than how we need them to be?"
5,"Ruby, will remember this book always","I've read just about everything by this wonderful author but left this little gem for last, well worth the wait. In the 'notes about the author' at the end, it says she's embarking on a new literary project... l'm so excited to find out more. I'm always looking out for new works by Mary Summer Rain, you'll never be bored by any of her works. Highly recommend it!Regards,Marta"
5,a great mystery,"There is so much packed into this book and it is so exciting to read. Written as a story, there are these characters with their confusion, pain and suffering. At the same time a great mystery is unfolding and Mary Summer Rain has us look at the nature of mystery itself and how we limit ourselves by trying to confine mystery to neat tidy boxes of understanding meant to keep us safe. It seems like there are metaphors in the characters; the critical judge, the silenced child, the searcher thrown into a journey. There is an openness to many forms of spiritual guidance and a revealing of the female aspect of God who brings healing to all of her children. For anyone suffering from grief, loss and guilt over a loved ones death, Mary Summer Rain helps you to see how the heart can open again to the beauty of love."
4,Excellent police procedural,"The plot is clever, and even as the basic outline of what happened starts to become apparent, you remain interested in the details of exactly how it could have happened. The lead character, Erlendur, is a flawed and morose middle-aged detective in the mold of Martin Beck or Kurt Wallander, though the characterizations aren't as deep as with Wallander. Perhaps in future volumes the potentially interesting relationship between Erlendur and his daughter Eva Lind will be developed. But this book is more about the dogged investigation into a murder, and as a police procedural, it's quite good. The setting is Iceland, but I didn't feel there was anything distinctively Icelandic about it; it could have been set anywhere (though the fact that Iceland is a small and (literally) insular society does contribute to the plausibility of the story). Perhaps someone who knows more than I about Iceland would perceive distinctive features that I missed."
4,An engaging crime thriller,"This is an excellent book that is hard to put down. If you like crime thrillers along the lines of Stieg Larsson, you may also enjoy Jar City (though there is no equivalent to Salander in this novel). It was also interesting to learn a little about Icelandic culture- since one of the underlying themes is directly associated with some unique characteristics of this island nation. I liked the book enough to purchase the next one in the series."
3,Quick read,This was a typical mystery. I was hoping for more details of Iceland. I felt very little sympathy for the characters due to the style of writing. It was more like reading a story in the newpaper.
2,Mediocre,"Indridason's writing is on the level of a high school student. His characters are more overwrought than your typical soap opera. The plot has no mystery, thrill, or pathos. This is mediocrity at its finest."
2,Not a thriller,"I usually enjoy mysteries that take place in other countries, especially if they are written by natives. This fit both criteria, but I just never got interested in the story or perhaps more importantly, the characters. The author seems to have totted up the usual list of tough cop attributes, but they do not form a cohesive character."
4,Not your run-of-the-mill whodunnit,"I've really come to enjoy books by foreign authors set in foreign landscapes because I feel like I learn something every single time I read one. In this case, I had no idea that in Iceland, they don't use surnames like we do. See, that's something you just don't learn on TV. Nor did I know that Iceland has a genetic database of its entire population, which is something that would certainly never fly in the U.S. Anyhoo, this wasn't your run-of-the-mill whodunnit. There is a murder that Erlendur and his partner Sigurdur Óli are trying to solve, but the story ends up being much more about the victim and what he did in his past. This is one case where the victim perhaps got what he deserved. Erlendur is somewhat of a drab character on his own, but I enjoy his interactions with others, especially with his wayward daughter, Eva Lind. I think there's a lot of room for growth in the series, and I look forward to reading the next two."
2,Jar City,Read two books by this author...neither set my heart aflutter...the writing seemed uninspired and Idid not care about any of the characters. Live and learn. I thought I would try another Swedishauthor after loving Stieg Larsson...my advice is keep looking.
4,book; Jar City,"I have read both Stieg Larson and Jo Nesbo and wanted to read an Islandic book. It is a good book. However starts out a bit slow, but it does gather speed towards the end. In the end it was a fairly satisfying read. Probably not enough to pick up another in the series."
4,"Good story, easy to read.",Easy reading style. Good plot and characters. One of those books that you find hard to put down once you've started it. I look forward to reading more from this author.
4,"Cold, dark and revealing","Indridasson has a great series going here. Jar City was the first I read and found the story, characters and settings ranging from amusing to riveting with an excellent feel for the culture of Iceland as a bouus. Three books later, having just finished Arctic Chill, I am still intrigued and the peeling back of what makes the characters tick takes these books interestingly beyond the plots."
2,A weak plot.,"Based on previous reviews, I expected more. Accordingly,I was disappointed. The plot seemed weak and the writing style was awkward. Way too much padding for an ending that was easy to predict. I kept hoping there would be more. I doubt that I'll be reading this author again"
1,In the minority,"I love good detective stories and relish the brilliantly written and engaging Wallander, Stieg Larsson series, etc., but I found Jar City nothing but grim characters in unremittingly bleak and gratuitously gross situations, forced, prose-like dialogue (translation?), almost a parody of a Scandinavian thriller. After the rape and exhumation scene halfway through, I felt I had had more than enough and bid Jar City a happy goodbye."
3,Cold and arid,"Jar City:A Reykjavik Thriller is more of a mystery rather than a thriller. I was led into some of the life of Iceland and particularly its relationship with the new sciences.There is a coldness about the plot and characters that feels uncomfortable. I had never considered that drugs would be problematic in Iceland.This was revealing to me just as the title opened my world a little."" Jar City"" should have been clear to me as I live near medical schools. I love to find things in books that I have been aware of at some subliminal level and the book causes the thought to pop to the surface. Well worth reading if not on my top ten list."
5,More ofthe same detectives,I really like a series with the same characters and detectives. Once again I also love the scenery of this beautiful country
4,"harsh weather, perceptive dectective","The weather is a character ---harsh, relentless, cold---in this small gem. The plot lines are multiple, thoughtful, and are at first like peering into an Icelandic storm. Hard to see but they emerge bit by bit: the consequences of rapes from 25 years ago; the abuse of a daughter; the separation of the protagonist from his own child; the facing of evil but not slipping into it. The best passage---the unearthing of a body, in both senses of the word. No easy resolutions, no simple answers. What more can a lover of dectective fiction want?"
4,This novel rang true since it kept it simple.,"It always amazes me when books are able to take me back in time before the digital age. This book was actually current, but for the use of cell phones I'm not sure you would have known that. It's a simple, uncomplicated mystery that was refreshing to read. Sometimes I wonder where all the fantastical ideas from authors come from. This novel rang true since it kept it simple."
3,An ok thriller,"Jar City is a story that involves detectives trying to solve a string of related murders that lead to scary family secrets and point to the person responsible for starting the killings with a scientific twist. It is a decent thriller but is very dark, depressing, and the writing (or perhaps the translation) seems stilted and the characters difficult to relate to. This is a good rental from your local library when you are feeling cheerful enough."
2,"English translation is tough to follow, characters are shallow","A pretty dark mystery novel. The darkness is the environment and characters. An unhappy divorced detective who has a junky daughter who is also a prostitute. A retired detective that is a misogynist. Neighbors and people of interest that seem shallow and thin. The story, mystery was not very interesting to me. I think some of my dissatisfaction is related to the translation. The book may have been translated into English, it was a far cry from American, and even if you are British I believe the nuance lost in translation causes Jar City to be a chore to read. I assume that it is a book that was a page turner for some, as the Amazon reviews are very positive. I expected something more like the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, Jar City is not it, at all. Both my wife and myself love the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo books. For me Jar City is not a book I would recommend."
4,Athens-Reykjavik through a book,"I read the book in Athens,during a hot , hot August with the city deserted. I carried the book with me everywhere, couldn't put it down even at work, slipped a few pages in, between sketching and drawing, I'm an architect.Having read my share of British, French and American mystery novels, I was pleasantly surprised by the doric style of this Scandinavian sibling. Dense and profound, it released emotions in an escalating way, subdued at first, gripping and almost terrifying towards the end. And I'm sure that a travel guide couldn't do a better job at communicating the feeling of being in Iceland. Made me curious of that curious country!I enjoyed it so much that I ordered "" Silence of the grave "" and will move on to "" Voices"". Great work!"
3,I hope you enjoy it.,"The Kingsmen were a good ""garage rock"" style band in the 1960s. The were arguably the most successful of the garage bands, since they had seven songs that made it into the Hot 100. This album is a typical one for them, since it contains two chart singles and a bunch of cover songs of other people's hits. Other than the hits, ""Little Latin Lupe Lu"" and ""Death of an Angel"", the highlights here are the three original songs that are included (""Long Green"", ""And You Believed Him"" and ""Give Her Lovin'""). Singer Lynn Easton was actually a decent, if derivative, songwriter. As for the cover songs that make up the bulk of the album, they are okay, for the most part. But none of them come close to matching the versions that were recorded by the original artists. Unless you are a big Kingsmen fan, you would be advised to get a ""best of"" CD, rather than one of their original albums."
1,HEATER almost KILLED my BABY!!!,"HEATER almost KILLED my BABY!!!HoneyWell Digital Ceramic Heater'Model HZ 370BP-TGTalthough thermostat was set at 68 degrees, the heater didn't shut off and heated the room up to 98 degrees. Another time it did the same thing and got up to 86 degrees. Thank goodness my daughter is safe, but it was extremely scary. If you have this heater or one that is similar, don't take any chances. Return it and get a different one please!Customer Service- 1-800-477-0457 for the heaters if you did have a similar experience."
4,Provides ample heat...controls leave something to be desired,"Heats up my home office great (12x14). Provides ample heat and knocks the chill off quickly. Heater is designed to sit on the floor. All the controls are mounted on the vertical flat surface on the front face, near the top of the heater. That means you have to really squat down and place your head around your knees to set the temperature. You cant tilt the heater back or the tip over switch kicks in and shuts it down. Other than this design flaw on accessing the controls, its a very good value. I noticed very little smell on initial start up."
1,Oscillation faulty,"I should have listened to the previous reviews, but thought I'd roll the dice. Like many other reviews before, the oscillation does not work, and it is brand new. Very disappointing that they are clearly getting feedback on faulty units, yet the quality control is still poor. I will be sending this back."
3,very safe to use,"I bought it for my dog. she will lay near this small heater. and when I move this heater, it will power off immediately. very safe design.but I found the electicity bill is expensive :("
4,Great deal !,"This heater works very well for the price, it heats up instantly and has a few safety features which is nice; it will turn off automatically when tipped or moved, and once it reaches the desired temperature it will click off, which is great for all of us energy conservationists out there; or if you are just trying to save a few dollars. The only complaint my husband and I have is that the oscillation only works to about 90 degrees, instead of 180. Other than that, it would have recieved 5 stars. Great buy !"
3,"Excellent for its price, but came broken","Great heater. I like its low-electricity option and the timers.I do not like that all settings reset every time you turn it off and on.The oscillation function was broken when the item arrived. It turns one way, but then it gets stuck. I don't know how to go through the returns, and I am very disappointed at how they handled a new product when shipping it to a customer."
3,Oscillating not working,Just received this heater and when I tried the oscillating feature it only rotates one way and then gets stuck. Deciding whether or not to return it because except for that it seems to be a really good heater.
2,Not worth the price!,"Pro's: It's a functional heater, if a bit pricey. Not too big. Has digital temperature display (ambient and setting).Con's: 1) It's an oscillating heater, which I didn't need and which is not in the description (at least to my eyes, in the product features). 2) Anti-tip over switch is far too sensitive- tip it a few degrees to see the temp display while it's on the floor, and it shuts down. At first I thought it was defective. 3) Lowest heat setting is 900W (vs 1500W Max); 750 or so would have been better. 4) Most annoying, no memory of last settings. Every time I turn it on, set to low(er) heat level, then rotate temp dial several turns to get the keep-warm temp from the 75 degrees default.New: Seems to change temperature setting spontaneously. Set to 62 deg, after a while it's at 60 deg. Not terrible in my case, but if a unit kept moving the temp up, could be a safety problem. Down to 2 stars!"
4,Okay,The heater does its job - great little unit that helps with my frigid bedroom. Doesn't get too hot so I feel comfortable leaving it on at night. Love the timer function. The only downside on this unit is that it doesn't read a correct temperature. It will display that the temp is 75 when it's really like 67 so you have to trick the unit and calculate what you want the heat at vs. what it actually displays. Kind of annoying but otherwise it has run well for me for a month now.
1,Piece of crap,"Won't oscillate. Heats up for a moment and then stops producing heat (but stays ""on""/lit). Doesn't have any sort of working blower/fan to push heat away from the device. This is going right back in the box and back to Amazon. Don't waste your time or $$$!!!"
3,Effective but loud.,"This heater is fairly loud compared to the other forced-air space heaters I have used. I returned it because it woke me up at night whenever it switched on. There was also a barely-audible sqeal it started to develop as it oscillated. If you are a heavy sleeper, or have a large enough bedroom that you can tuck the heater in a far corner, this probably won't be an issue for you. One other complaint is that I had to reset the thermostat every time I turned it on, because it doesn't remember the settings after being turned off. Otherwise, it did the job nicely."
5,Very good,I have access to all kinds of old heaters for free. I bought this because of the safety features and thermostat. Only want it to run when it's needed. Don't want to come home to a burning house because the cats knocked the thing over.Works very good. Pumps out the heat. Like the engineers say: 1500 watts of heat is 1500 watts of heat. You can't change that. Why pay a bunch more when you can't increase the actual efficiency. I do think the fan distributes the heat much more efficiently.
4,Designed as a text for student composers wanting to learn the basics of musical form,"Schoenberg worked on this text as part of his work with students at UCLA. He worked on it until his death in 1951 and had revised it several times. It is meant for students of composition rather than general music students studying form. The terminology is often Schoenberg's own and he, of course, has many interesting and strongly held views and approaches. It is not a text on twelve-tone composition, but of traditional and classic forms.It was written in English rather than Shoenberg's native German, but he had the help of this volume's editor, Gerald Strang. In this edition, many of Schoenberg's specially composed examples were replaced by examples from the literature and the proprietary examples moved to the volume ""Structural Functions of Harmony"". This is meant to serve as a very fundamental discussion of these matters for students who are thinking about becoming composers."
2,Shyne Po No Mo,"All of this hype for this album for what something obviously thrown together at the last minute.Shyne is one of my favorites don't get me wrong but how can you release this garbage and think its fire? There are a couple songs that are good but Scarface he isnt!!! This is not worth 10 dollars or more, should be like 5 bucks then it would be worth it."
4,Great Sophomore Album From Shyne. . .,"Well, what more can I say? Buy the album because Godfather Burried Alive is f*ckin' HOT! ""The Gang"" and ""More or Less"", both featuring Foxy Brown are my two favorite tracks. It's just too bad ""For The Record"" (50 Cent Diss Track) was done over the phone so the quality is very poor, because he has some bomb lines in the song, just hard to hear.The production on this album is great, very versitle sound. One song sounds like Jay-Z, the next will sound like Nas, the other will sound like Royce Da 5'9, or Scarface. Great debut on Def Jam!I'd give this album 4 stars, but I recommend this heavily."
3,godfather-shyne,"im sorry but i dont really care for this, it lack the niceness of the last album. a couple of things to comment on;1st- shyne is way to good for foxy brown and ashanti.\2nd- the song ""for the record"" i cant even understand what he is sayin i love the fact he is disin 50 cent but...3rd- why did he reck a classic kurupt song?????4th- his production is shocking the only good one is kanye west!but there are some pluses like the few good songs: the gang, more or less, dimonds and mack-10s, quasi o.g and a few other but all these songs have there falts (sorry shyne). Shyne could of done a lot with this album but what can you do.i would now like to talk about shyne lyricly. he is very clever. but some of the lyrics can be ofencev to people.inconclusion i just regret what he has done with this he could of done much more: 3 stars from me."
2,not that good,"i dont know what all these other cats listened to, but i was very dissapointed. the production isnt all that great, and shyne's flows are awful(except for 2 songs). he's saying the same old ish that people were saying back in 94. talking about how many people he's merked and his hoes. man come with some tighter flows i know u got time."
2,"""Godfather Buried Alive""","Back by popular demand is Jamal Barrow, better known as ""Shyne"". Although he is incarcerated, he still has a thing in his heart for hip-hop and about being heard. No longer with Bad Boy, his new label ""Gangland Records"", Shyne has much to say. With commercial single ""Jimmy Choo"" featuring Ashanti, it is nice and flufy on radio and tv play. But if you have this album (or plan on purchasing it), you'll know he's no commercial rap puppet. Wit retaliation at 50 Cent ""For The Record"" is straight up truth and revenge ""You don't wanna ride/You wanna get rich and hide/Cause n****s would've died if they shot me nine times"".Finding ways to record his album through jail (he also had old tracks before he was jailed), overall he has given his all with this album. If your willing to listen, your willing to hear his side of the story."
1,more Hype than substance,"I wish He used His Voice more powerful than what He is showing here. He has some Talent,but seems to playing along with the flow to fit in. He Needs to drop a Album of How He stayed Loyal to Puffy&J-Lo but that is another story.these tracks seem like they have been sitting in a vault&just touched&Tweaked a bit. the Hype is selling far more than the Quality here."
3,Disappointing,I was eager to buy this album expecting some more hot tracks like the lead single Jimmy Choo.But i was rather diappointed.The beats are very weak except for the Just Blaze produced tracks.Shyne can rhyme theirs no doubt about that but sometimes his laid back voice doesn't go to well with the beats and it makes the song boring.And that track that he recorded over the phone that was just wack.This is still a decent album however it isn't what i had expected.
5,"Had to Rewrite the review, but the grade remains.","I had about two pages worth of grading process on this review.BUT, as normal, amazon tries to spite me yo.But alright. Highlights of this album, the MASSIVE increase in excellent beats, and the even MORE SUBSTANTIAL elevation of Shyne as an MC, and lyricist makes this album the underdog fans' dream.Shyne steps from a 6.0 out of 10.0 debut, and hanging onto a 9.0 for dear life. Beats are brilliantly constructed and diverse... and Shyne weaves through the relevant, and cliched material, and makes it come alive, as he pours his raw insides out for us, coal, bread and water.Martyr is the song of the year easily, and worth the 9.00 alone.Get this one."
3,Won't go gold !,"Here we have yet another EXTREMELY hyped album from a talented emcee that completely flops, and does't live up to the afformentioned hype. I like Shyne...the kid is nice, but this album just didn't do it for me. Also...Shyne lost his record deal to the poor sales, and the unbelievable amount of money they put into this Shyne project that the execs don't think they'll ever see again. Maybe piracy hurt Shyne sales. I know a lot of my friends ripped rather than bought. Who knows ? The production is so so, and even Shynes throw-back lyrics aren't that impressive. Oh well...how about we all just await the return of The Deputy ( G-Dep ) as we try to move on from this total let down. ( sigh )"
1,I wasn feelin diz coz it bored me...,"I bought Shyne's ""godfather Buried alive"" thinking he had tight lirycs and good beats that i could feel but insted what i got was a plain dull & boring deliverence by diz cat and i was truly dissapointed. First the beats? What the f*ck ?! Sounds horrible and Shyne's lirycs & his voice will put you to sleep coz some say its raw but i say its boring as it gets...It ain't raw but you want mc's wid raw voices ? Try prodigy from mobb deep cox his voice is ill... I don't recommend diz at all. Peace!"
1,This whole CD is just plain GARBAGE,"I agree with the guy below me, what a bunch of garbage. I loved his other Cd. His songs on there are much, much better. I went to the store and listened to this and I just walked out the store with my head hanging low. What a waste of my time. He can't even rap on here."
2,"Shyne , doesn't shyne in my eye.","Shyne , doesn't shyne in my eye.there is reason wwhy this man is in jail , because he is stupid enough to get caught. his albums gets 2 out of 5"
2,"""Not dat tight, yo""","Seriously, you moron social parasites really type like my title reads....maybe if you maggots actually got an education, you might not end up like Shyne who is in prison now, probably bending over for some large redneck from Indiana!"
1,SHYNE GO GET UR OWN STYLE!!BIGGIE WANNA BE.,There goes another STUDIO gangsta.He doesnt sound like biggie.He tries to sound like biggie.He call himself gangsta???HE DONT WANNA REPRESENT HIS HOOD.AND WHAT THE FU*k was about dissin 50.50 gonna shoot his a*s when SHYNE come out of prison.50's empire is soooo big!And shyne talks about guns???He is not strong enough to lift a butter knife!!He's a perfect example of how few blowj*bs to irv gotti and ja fool puts you on a album.GGGGGG-Unit.
3,Should Have Never Been Released,This album is full of cuts off his first album. I dont think that an album full of cuts is going to do too hot.
4,Heeeee's Back,"Shyne-Po has arisen back onto the rap scene with this new album which was not all I thought it would be cracked up to be, but still a very complete and solid album. Much similiar to his first album which hard core lyrics and different beats. Lyrics wise cannot be denied. His flow pattern on this album is crazy with the way he uses different rhyme schemes. If you liked Shyne's first album then I would def reccommend this album as well"
5,Outstanding,"Don't just think of AMAZED. if you've had your heart broken, SMILE is a song that you have to hear. This CD is great from front to back"
5,Amazed,Absolutely the best song for anyone in love is 'Amazed'. It just flat-out tells it like it is. You don't have to be 'country' to know what is good.
5,AWESOME!,"This is my favorite cd. Lonestar is by far the best country music group there is! Amazed is an awesome song, I highly recommend this CD. Its great."
3,Good Album but I won't give Lonestar the benefit,"Lonestar is the biggest disappointment in country music. They have become Gap promotional personnel. I remember when Lonestar wore cowboy hats and blue jeans and sung songs that went ""when cowboys didn't dance, didn't wear designer shirts"" funny how we all become hypocrites all of a sudden. Music is good, without a doubt with hints of the steel in Smile and their big hit Amazed. But with them making a pop version of Amazed makes them a big disappointed. I guess that's how you make it big..do pop.Former Fan, Pete Kic"
1,pure formula,Just Like with Rap&R-N-B nowadays Country has gone downhill as well.When LoneStar can Blow UP something is wrong.this group is just following the Path of Shania&Garth.Middle of the Road Pop.Basic Arrangements&music.this disc is the Eagles Lite.
1,anyone want a barf bag with their lonestar?,"awful. 0 (zero) originality. cookie cutter, 12-track, over-produced. if your idea of a great night out is a big mac extra-value meal and checking out the new models of wide screen tv at the local best buy, then this album is for you. if not, then try some real american music, like bill monroe or the stanley brothers. the fact that this album is popular makes me lose faith in humanity."
5,Lonestar is awesome,"I want to come back on the review and say more about this CD. I love this Cd and I love all the songs. Richie's voice is so awesome. My favorite songs are; ""Simple As That"", ""What About Now"", ""Tell Her"", ""I've gotta find you"". I really love all the songs on this Cd. It is so hard to pick my favorite. This is the best Cd I have every brought. You will get your money worth. I pronise you.Great job Lonestar. You guys keep up the good work and you will be around for a while."
2,Lonely Grill,"Hello there music fans! I'm not really into country music, but thought the song ""Amazed"" would be totally awesome for a wedding song. The words seem just perfect to describe a new, young couple. I am also open to other music ideas for wedding songs. Anyone got any other ideas for a good couples song? Any type of music will do. (Hopefully you can comment on this letter I am writing...why do they force you to use 75 words?) Please feel free to give ideas for good wedding songs. I'm a bit stumped. Thank you so much."
5,great stuff,"Why Lonestar released ""Saturday Night"" as their first single from this album is a mystery to me, this is the worst track of the album. Therefore, I was really surprised when I listened to the (rest of the) album: all the other songs are absolutely great, and ""Amazed"" is sure to become a classic. The remaining question is: what is to be their next single? Is there life for a next single after the enormous success of ""Amazed""??"
5,Far and away the best thing they have ever done.,"I knew I liked Lonestar before I saw them live, but I was not prepared for how good they were in person. This album captures how they sound in concert. If you like ""Amazed"" you'll love ""Smile"" and the arrangements are as interesting as the vocals are good. There were hints of what type of voice Richie has on previous albums, but nothng like this."
4,chowmum,I get the impression Peter Kic wouldn't know a great band if he heard one! This CD is one of the best out there. Lonestar has come a long way.
2,This album has an AMAZING song but otherwise remains LONELY,"They songs aren't bad...but the only real hit is Amazed and maybe Smile. Saturday Night isn't too bad, but overall I was dissapointed when I bought the CD. I was expecting other revved country tunes or sweet ballads. The songs aren't either, their aren't dances or ballads, they're lounging music and if you like that, grab this album, but if you want to knock your boots off or put you and your girl on the floor skip this one."
5,The song AMAZED alone was enough to earn the 5-star rating.,AMAZED is the best song EVER. I'm not even a die-hard country fan. I heard this song the first time by accident and now I spend hours scanning country stations just waiting to hear it again. I can't get enough of it! The video is also great.
5,AMAZE-ING ALBUM,"Lonestar's lonely grill album might be the most powerful vocal album in years. There powerful single, ""amazed"" shows lead singer Richie McDonald's powerful voice. They also like to get down and have a little fun on ""Saturday Night"". The upbeat song can get anyone going and partying in no time. Overall, this is the best album in country music so far this year. Watch out Alabama, you got company for many of years with this great band. Don't be surprized if they won't walk away with many awards in the future. Get and enjoy the album today!"
1,Amazed? Yeah right. An Amazing Ripoff.,"I confess that I haven't bought this album, but having heard the single ""Amazed"" - all I have to say is: RIPOFF! Short of sampling ""Everything I Do"" by Bryan Adams, they couldn't have written more of a clone. The lyrics are basically ripped off from ""Everything I Do"", while the melody is basically straight from ""Please Forgive Me"" . . ."
5,A GOOD READ!!!,"Louisiana in the 1800's. Slavery. Love. Cruelty. Passion. Society. Oppressive heat. Sickness. Birth. Death. Growing up. Friendship. All of these are elements of an engrossing story with compelling characters. This book is written with such rich descriptions that I was transported to another time, another place. Always and Forever was an absolute pleasure to read."
1,Skip it!,"I was very disappointed in this recording. From what I understand the Standells reluctantly recorded this LP of cover tunes under pressure from their label. The problem is that the songs are almost note for note carbon copies of the originals. There is no originality here. There is no unique Standell's sound that characterized songs like ""Dirty Water"" and ""Sometimes Good Guys Don't wear White"". My question is, ""Why bother?"". If I wanted to hear these songs at all I'd go find the originals.Anyway, if you want to listen to the Standells buy a ""Best of"" and enjoy!"
2,Standells - 'Hot Ones' (Sundazed) 2 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1966,it was their follow-up to the 'Dirty Water' album(see my review).While I admit it is NO where near as good as 'Dirty...','Hot Ones' is a so-so CD reissue full of mostly the Standells performing covers,from you guessed it,1966.Tracks that I thought were 'okay' include Donovan's ""Sunshine Superman"",Lovin' Spoonful's ""Summer In The City"",the Beatle's ""Eleanor Rigby"" and the Trogg's ""Wild Thing"".Very little originality here,but hey...plenty of records are like that.You know?For big-time Standells fans,like myself."
1,Sloppy,"After reading just the first few pages of this book, all I can say is sloppy! ""Walt"" compares himself to a Weeble toy, but they were not introduced until 1971, years after his death. The room next to his office, where he would spend time with Hazel George at the end of his work day is refered to as his ""laughing room,"" when in fact, it was his ""laughing place,"" a reference to the film ""Song of the South."" Whether these mistakes are the writer's or translater's fault is hard to clarify, but for a person whose life was as well-documented as Walt Disney's, these sort of errors are inexcusable, even in a work of ostensible fiction."
4,Good Bedroom or Shop Unit,"Radio has good channel separation and good sound on FM. I use it in my office.Things I liked:It has super power (enough to run you out of the room).The remote is easy to usePlays MP3 on the cd playerPrice was fair for the sound quality.Some of the things I wish it had but doesn't:1. More inputs, there is only one mini-plug input. I have a tape deck, and stream from my computer but there is no input for the tape machine.2. Tuneable EQ...Equalizer is pre-configured for five or so different options. There's no way to tweak it further. I wish there was a way I could add more highs.3. Sub woofer doesn't turn off when the unit is off. It's plugged into a different outlet and stays on all the time.I listen to this every day in the office and it's great for that purpose."
4,OMG Is this LOUD!!!!!,"This system gets really, very loud. I can only get it up to volume 22 and then my ears start screaming.But I don't like not being able to control the bass, treble, etc...They have an equalizer but it's one of those preset ""Rock, Jazz, Flat...""I'm not happy with that 'cause a lot of times the bass is just too damn overwhelming for the music. It's why I didn't give the product a 5. If you like heavy bass then this is a great system for you for under $140. (plus shipping)The subwoofer is amazingly big. (To me it is.)This system definitely has a lot of kick for something so small.Id recommend it. Just wish I could control the bass.Oh, the packaging it comes in is HUGE. I was really surprised howbig the box was. The company packaged it up real good for shipping.It's worth the extra shipping charge you have to pay. You may be just as surprised as I was when you see how big the box is."
3,Surprising,"The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands is one of the strangest albums ever made. Amongst some truely awful songs (like ""The Battle Of The Bands"", ""Oh, Daddy"" & ""Chicken Little Was Right"") and novelty/pastiche songs (""Sound Asleep"", ""Elenore"" and ""Food"") are a couple of monster jams. Surprisingly, ""I'm Chief Kamanawanalea (We're The Royal Macadamia Nuts)"" and ""Buzzsaw"" were sampled by hip hop artists. That The Beastie Boys were even aware of this album (let alone could find anything useful here), is a testament to their brilliance.This album sounds like a band with nothing to lose and so decided to make a hodge-podge album of various styles. The results are mixed.Download at iTunes.[DW]"
2,yecch,"Most of this is just stupid parodies--funny, I guess, but hardly worth listening to more than once. (I do like the song ""Food"", though...)"
4,The Turtles tribute to a 60's phenomona,"The 60's was a time of garage bands and of a poplular local event called the Battle of the Bands. Local bars and county fairs staged competitions to bring out the ""Best of the Best"" Prizes varried from recording contracts to cash and this was the Turtles tribute to that phenomona. The Turtles played a variety of music as only they can. The album produced 2 hit singles...Elenore and You Showed Me. The two bonus tracks rounding out this album are nice additions. Sound Asleep was a hit which charted, and The Story of Rock and Roll is an underated tune which should have done better on the charts. The Turtles best album ! ! ! ! !"
1,Don't Buy - Mislabled,"Amazon screwed up -Mislabled here - If you buy the ""Entrain"" cd music samples listed here- You get ""No Matter What"" CD - - You'll get Colorblind as first song not Dancing in the LightAll the rest with be wrong as well"
4,Complete A&M Recordings ...At Last,"It is great to finally have all of the A&M; stuff together but I agree with some of the points made by others. I feel that it is a bit of a mess as a set and not terribly well thought through as far as the packaging goes. I got the one with no track list on the discs and the only easy guide as to what is on the discs is on the back cover of the box and that is not set out very well either. I have made up my own detailed track list to slip into the booklet. As someone else said, there are no reprints of the original covers and the way the albums role over from one disc to the other looks lazy and as if whoever put it together just didn't really care about doing it right. What a shame. I would have been most happy to pay a little more for some thought, insight and effort deserving of the legend that is Joan Baez.That said, it is all here finally and to that end, a most welcome addition to my huge Joan Baez collection."
4,Good for Little Ones,"We were very happy with this product. Pretty well made. We had it embroidered on the side to say ""Big Brother on Duty"" and put some baby stuff in it (obviously as a gift for a new big brother). The pockets seem a little big but not deep enough. It would have been nice for them to be about an inch deeper, but it is still very functional.I would definitely buy this again. I plan on getting this bag again to give as a gift for an new ""big"" brother or sister. I haven't found anything that comes close to this one."
4,Doesn't Make coffee,But for the price I'll make my own.....Simple easy to use had a more expensive DVR this one is soooo much bettercant record those special 1.5 or 2.5 hr discs ...oh well dvr discs are what 20cents ????love it love it5 stars if it made coffee....Nothins Perfect...lol
2,This is nothing but [...],I bought this for myself thinking that it would be good for the money. But I was disapointed when it stoped worked within a month os use. It gut my dvd's stuck in there and wouldn't come out and if it did it erased what I had recorded. After that the timer wouldn't work on the m-f timings so I had to set it one each day that I wanted it to record sometimes it wouldn't record at all. I would say to anybody that wants to buy this to not because it is nothing but [...].
4,"Old ""Skool"" Kung Fu!!","I agree with the first reviewer,,this is another one of Shaw's best performance. This flick was entertaining from start to finish. The most impressive, was the chrystal clear transfer onto dvd,,,absolutely amazing!!The kung fu, simply too amazing. Talk about trends, this flick set them!!"
4,old movie,"I seen this movie back in the 70's and thought it was very good,so I got this one, the price was right too,but I've had the movie now for or five week and still haven't watched it,sorry."
5,Bought as a gift,I'd never heard of this book. It was purchased as a gift. The person I gave it to really enjoyed it.
4,"Very Good, But Second To Redwall","I had read all the Redwall books at least once, and then I found this one. It is a very good book, but It is not as good as Redwall. Redwall just seems to have more feeling or something. Still, I highly recomend this book and I'm looking forward to the next one."
4,Urchin of the Riding Stars,"My daughter enjoyed reading this book. She read it in her spare time, took a flashlight into bed to read it, and read the book in the car. She really enjoyed this book."
1,Mistmantle Chronicles Too Violent and Macabre,"The books are exciting, but contain parts which are very violent such as a serial killer squirrel who kills baby animals for some sort of macabre enjoyment. There are also parts that are just down right bizarre for a children's book, like a squirrel named Smokewreath that uses bodies of other animals to conjure up magic. The Redwall books are much more interesting and less twisted and horrific!"
5,amazing,I really enjoyed this book in fact the series. As a nanny I would read it with my charge and soon I found I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. I have been waiting for a long time for the 3rd book and now I'm running to the store ASAP so I can find out what happens to the friendly squirrel!! hope you enjoy this series as much as we do!
5,Wonderfully written--great story and great to read aloud,"Most nights I still read to my ten-year-old son, and we were both surprised and absoltuetly taken by Mistmantle. He's a big reader by himself, and this was the first time that he ended up so eager to Know What Would Happen that he read ahead of me, and finished it first (and then urged and urged me to catch up--). We both loved the story, the language, the characters--we could stop and predict things together, registering the ways McAllister was setting things up, or the ways she revealed why certain figures behaved as they did. A really smart, page-turning adventure investigating right and wrong and honor and friendship--"
3,Audible Version NOT Unabridged,The Audible version cut off the complete ending and other bits and pieces throughout the story. Very disappointing for such a great story.
2,"Okay, but too dark","It was a very stimulating story, excieting and interesting, but it is much darker then Redwall, with more magic. One of the ""baddies"" practices some sort of black magic. I would have liked to read the rest of the series, but I thought that plot element was unnecessary. Too bad."
3,TOYS CD,"An O.K. nostalgia CD which is probably worth owning just to obtain their biggest hit single - ""A LOVER'S CONCERTO"" which is probably the best track on this CD. Also included is the follow-up single to ""Concerto"" entitled ""Baby Toys"" which is listenable but otherwise none of the other tracks are memorable I'm afraid.Also included is the original version of ""What's wrong with me baby ?"" which went on to become a big Northern Soul Classic via the INVITATIONS version which was enormously popular in the clubs and dancehalls of the day.Nice to have in your collection if you're a nostalgia buff like myself, so grab it whilst you can as it is quite a sought-after and perhaps even hard-to-obtain CD."
5,GOOD STUFF,This has some of the best reggae songs ever. I am from Hawaii and this stuff is quite popular here. It is one of my favorite CDs.
2,"Jerry Baker's Green Grass Magic: Tips, Tricks, and Tonics for Growing the Toe-Ticklinest Turf in Town!",This book is outdated. It utilized terms and procedures that are either extinct or are a thing of the past. Most municipalities have banned the use of phosphorus and the like. I've also discovered that a lot of the tonics Jerry discusses are regurgitated several times throughout to book and many do not describe the coverage of the tonic (my idea of run-off may be different from someone else). This is a useful book; I just would not have paid more than $10 for it.
5,Great Book and well orginized,"I haven't had a chance to try the many suggestions but found the book to be a wealth of information, and very well orginized. I'm glad I bought it, and expect to try the many suggestions it offers."
5,Jerry Baker's green grass magic,"The product arrived promptly at my door in top condition following ""one click"" on my computer screen... which is just a hard to beat arrangement... Thanks Amazon"
3,Don't count this,Got this book when I was thinking of making a yard. I made an acre garden instead so don't look at this review.
5,The First Music Business Book You Should Read,"Ms. Schwartz explains key terms and concepts that are vital to the understanding of this business. Perhaps the greatest lesson to be taken from this book is that the music business is just that: a business. Ms. Schwartz explains how to approach your music career as a business while maintaining your artistic integrity. Whether you are in a band looking to get signed, an aspiring music executive, or just curious about the music business, this book will point you in the right direction full steam ahead."
1,A waste of time,"This book doesn't tell you anything that's really relevant in today's music industry, which is struggling to figure out how to make money. Not only that, but major label are no longer the way to go."
4,Encouraging.,This book was encouraging. It did answer a lot of my questions about record labels. I still think I am going to stay indie because there is just as much money to make this way.
5,Some good heavy Metal,"This is the best Crue album ever. Really raw and heavy. Knock Em Dead Kid has a killer, killer riff! Same for Shout and Bastard. Ten Seconds to Love is a great ... tune and Danger is a slower pace, but great song.This album is on par with GNR's Appetie and Metallica's Master of Puppets as the best metal album ever!!"
1,Hmmm!,"I borrowed this cd from a friend because I head heard a lot about it and not to mention about this band. The guy who owned it didn't like it but and my expectations weren't high. This album is horrid. It is just so bad. I mean the playing is so so. lyrically it's nothing special and its so glossy and poppy kind of looking that its hard to swollow. Why people bought this is beyond me, why some people thought it to be shocking is way way beyond me. This isn't shocking. This is funny and the guys are funny. Sure it's nothing wrong with image but when you begin to live of it instead of good music and killer 24/7 it becomes a bit tiring. My vote 2/10 which equals 1 /5. Not very good album formualatic and its mission to sell it to chicks, 10 year old kids and suburban teenagers."
1,80:s metal at its worst,"I bought this CD after hearing one song that I really liked. Turned out to be the only good track on the album, ""Looks That Kill"" is the track that stands out, the reast is just crap, 80:s metal at its worst. There's only image here. A lot of long hair, leather and spikes - not much of an attityde though. From the 70:s-style opening, which puts you in an akward place, this album sucks. The cover of the Beatles rocker ""Helter Skelter"" is outright embarrassing. If you grew up with this you might appriciate it. But if your a bit older and were raised on Kiss or Alice Cooper or David Bowie for that matter, this will not be good enough for you. If so, don't buy this piece of 80:s glam-ripoff."
4,SHOCK ROCK RETURNS,"crue ups the ante with this strong followup to the punkpop classic too fast for love. maybe not as solid throughout (""god bless the children of the beast"" screams filler, and covers were never the crue's strong suit - see ""helter skelter""), the ferocious atmosphere of this record is what makes it work. it's more evil than kiss OR alice cooper ever was. the riffs are killer - check out ""looks that kill"" and ""too young to fall in love"". and maybe the best track is the last one, ""danger"" ""you're in danger and this is my town - this is hollywood..."""
4,excellent album by the crue,4 1/2 stars. But not in the same league as Too Fast For Love. Excellent makeup days here. The whole album rules with the exception of Danger. Still a must get.
5,Exciting Motorcycle Action!,"The latest (and, sadly, last) Hardy Boys story finds Frank and Joe at a motorcycle rally held to benefit a disabled young woman.Of course, this being a Hardy Boys story, there are plenty of thrills and mystery.Someone breaks into the rally sponsor's office, there's a mysterious fire, the Boys' friend has his motorcycle stolen, all in addition to plenty of motocross action!Naturally, Frank and Joe are deeply involved in the case and pursue the criminals right up to the exciting conclusion!"
3,Here's the thing that would be the prize.,"This was the fourth album by the Kingsmen, of ""Louie Louie"" fame. There were two original songs released from the album. ""Annie Fanny"" reached #47 on the charts and ""The Climb"" reached #65. The rest of the album features mostly mediocre cover versions of recent hits. An okay album, but a Kingmen greatest hits album would be a better bet for most people."
3,"It's Garage, what Else?","Judging by the cover you might think these guys were lame fifties folkies, but they are secretly mediocre 60s rockers. For those unaware, this is the band that made `Louie Louie' a household name, but there's nothing that special here. It's enjoyable if you're into 60s garage bands. Recommended for fans of `Nuggets'."
1,Gumbo v. Dumbo,"I found it a simple book to read, as it is composed ofmonosyllable words and one-line sentences. As the prose is aimed at asimple audience, the targeted audience should find the reasoning of the author's arguments quite to his or her's taste. As a photography book, quite hilarious (good cut and paste work). As a serious work of prose, quite impotent."
2,At least the spelling is correct,"This is actually a very funny book, as long as you don't take yourslf and Carville too seriously. Below the comedy surface though it is hard to tellwhether Carville is really a master at creating this bizarre persona or whether he really does hate so many people based upon their political beliefs. To those without enough intelligence to treat it as very nasty humor, it could be considered hate speech and inspire those mentally unbalanced people on the left to commit acts of violence. Carville would be funnier if he was non-partisan like Mark Russell. He does have a tendency to be just plain hateful. The 'facts' which Carville puts together are actually more circumstantial and speculative than those of Starr - who is declaring war against."
1,zzzzzz.....more political mudslinging,"No question he is a witty guy, but I am sooooo tired of the spinning and personal attacks. Negative/dirty politics do nothing more than degrade our once great country further and further. A quick hit for personal gain without consideration of the greater impact of ones actions. Sad."
1,Worse Than Expected,"I bought this book well aware of Mr. Carville's reputation for rhetoric. However, thinking the same hysterics wouldn't apply to his writting, I expected a somewhat calmer, balanced, and, shall I say, saner treatment of the subject than can be found in this book. When it came down to it I just didn't believe him. I'm not entirely sure this is a balanced man."
4,An Angry Man....,"This is an angry man, no two ways about it. His bias comes through in ever word of the book but this does not tarnish the facts. Sometimes the book becomes uncomfortable as he assaults Ken Starr, but the more you read - and the more facts take the side of Mr. Carville - the more you realize what a crook Ken Starr really was. No matter your position on Clinton, there is no excuse for Starr's activity and Carville will obviously accept none."
5,Love me some James Carville!,"An extremely interesting book. Great background on the lying skunks responsible for the Bush Administration, as well as a lot of skullduggery during the Clinton Administration! Carville, as always, nails it!"
3,"""Eternal Justice weighs the sins of the hot blooded and the cold hearted on different scales""","James Carville argues, quite successfully, that Ken Starr was never an ""independent"" prosecutor. He makes this argument in a way that makes you cry for our government. Now, Carville is not an independent evaluator in any sense of the word, but to read the shenanigans of Starr and his cronies and colleagues is depressing.Who cries for our country? Carville notes the line from Dante's The Inferno, ""Eternal Justice weighs the sins of the hot blooded and the cold hearted on different scales.""I'm waiting for this weighing."
5,AT HIS BEST!,Carville is right on with this book! He runs through theentire scandal and why this impeachment was a true travestymanipulated by a few wealthy Clinton bashers. People may not like the man but the facts are in! He does his research!
2,Poor,The recording quality sounds like it was taken off of AM radio.I am glad I only paid $0.25 for it.
5,Guns N' Roses Rock,"Guns N' Roses were a great band, and they have one of my favoritesongs of all time, November Rain. Other than that, I like the rest of the album great maybe the best greatest hits album of alltime."
2,The Music Rocks...but The Song Selection Blows!,"To make a greatest hits cd and put it on one disc was a HUGE mistake. Guns n Roses has so many great and essential songs that a greatest hits album would have to be at least to discs worth of music. Even then it wouldn't cover all of their essential tracks. Guns n Roses only came out with three albums of origional material and i wouldn't count on Chinese Democracy. Axl may still controll the name but GnR isnt GnR without Slash Duff and Izzy. My suggestion would be to buy a copy of Appetite For Destruction. You will leave that in your sterio for at least 2 months, i'll gaurentee it. Every track on that album is worthy of a greatest hits cd. Then if you like Guns n Roses buy the Use Your Illusion's. Those albums have a ton of great songs on them too. Then they Live albums are great."
2,This is not a real greatest hits,Guns had so many great songs! This is just a way for the record company to make up for the money they have put in to Chinese Democracy(they have to pay the gunners less for covers) an Axl Rose led solo project.Start withAppetite for Destruction if you like that move on to Use your Illusion 1 and 2Wheres AXL????????
2,Definately not their greatest hits...,"Guns n' Roses is one of the best bands ever and it is tough to narrow it down to 14 songs.. But who's idea was it to put Aint it fun, Live and Let die, Since I don't have you... etc? Who's idea was it to put 5 cover songs on a best of album? Five!"
2,Greastist hits?? COME ON!,"Ya sure they have some good tunes on here. But as far as making this the 1 Guns cd,with every killer tune they did. This falls short by mile!There isnt one song from Lies,Lies,Lies on here. Just another way for Axel to squeeze another buck outta of the fans. Fan? Any die hard Guns fan should be disapointed."
2,missing too many songs,where is the song ESTRANGED?what about the song COMA?what about the song MR. BROWNSTONE?this cd is missing too many great songs.
3,Not Too Good,"Finally! A greatest hits collection for Guns N Roses! (Live Era doesn't count). There is no way to include all of their songs onto one disc. Therefore there are many songs missing. Some of which include ""Mr. Brownstone,"" ""Dust N' Bones,"" ""Coma,"" and ""Estranged."" Space is wasted to make room for an awful ""Live and Let Die"" remake and a mediocre cover of Bob Dylan's ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door."" If a two-disc set would come out there should also be ""Double Talkin Jive,"" ""So Fine, ""14 Years"" and something else to represent AFD; maybe ""You're Crazy"" or ""My Michele."" Don't waste your money on this, even to get a G'N'R'S poster, instead buy their three full length albums and if you like acoustic or live get g'n'r Lies."
2,Not Worth It,"Guns N' Roses were such an original band. That being said, why does their 14-track Greatest Hits album have 5 cover songs on it? (Knockin on Heaven's Door, Live & Let Die, Ain't It Fun, Since I Don't Have U, and Sympathy For The Devil)If you are going to have 5 covers on GN'R's Greatest Hits Album, you better make it 2-Discs. And hopefully it would include more GN'R Classics like ""My Michelle"", ""Rocket Queen"", ""Night Train"", ""Used To Love Her"" ""Estranged"" ""Dead Horse"" ""Mr. Brownstone"", ""Double Talkin' Jive"", ""Think About You"" or ""Garden Of Eden"".Save your cash and just get Appetite For Destruction, GN'R Lies, and the Use Your Illusion albums. You'll be glad u did."
2,Axl will never get another dime of my money,"Guns N' Roses could have ruled the world. In 1988 they were the coolest rock band ever, but then Axl decided to kill their career and dissapoint millions of loyal fans with the bloated excess of Use Your Illusion I and II. If you want a Guns N Roses cd in your collection, simply buy Appetite for Destruction and enjoy it. You can hear a young hungry band on that album, and it's the only Guns N Roses album that really mattered as far as an impact on music and pop culture. So, I cannot recommend this Greatest Hits cd."
2,These guys were TRULY DONE over 10 years ago...,"Guess Mr.Rose started having to buy MAD-DOG 20/20 instead of Crown Royal...desperate attempt at making some final money before he has to get a real job. Well, the way I see it as most of these songs are already on Albums ALREADY owned...You must be mentally deficient to waste NO LESS than 15$ on this garbage."
3,Terrible song list.,"The greatest hits should be realised as double CD.Here is my ""best of ""album:disk one-hard rock:1.nightrain2.It's so easy3.mr.brownstone4.welcome to the jungle5.outta get me6.nice boy7.back off bitch8.dead horse9.duble talking jive10.get in the ring11.you could be mine12.shadow of your love13.oh my god14.rocket queen(live)disk two--soft ballads1.sweet child o'mine2.patience3.used to love her4.you are crazy(alt)5.live and let die6.don't cry7.november rain8.civil war9.14 years10.estraged11.since I don't have you12.patience(live)13.november rain(live)"

3,Civil War and November Rain is all you need to listen to.,Civil War and November Rain is all you need to listen to. Those are GNR's best songs and rock. Paradise City sucks.
1,THE FIVE STAR REVIEWER ABOVE ME IS AN IDIOT,"G'N'R WERE AMONGST THE MOST OVERRATED BANDS OF ALL TIME ALONG WITH NIRVANA,GREEN DAY AND DIRE STRAITS.THIS COMPILATION HAS ONLY ONE GOOD SONG IN SWEET CHILD OF MINE,REST OF THE SONGS STINK EXPLOSIVELY.AVOID ALL ALBUMS FROM THIS HUGELY OVERRATED BAND AND GET ANY ALBUM FROM GREAT BANDS LIKE THE WHO,LED ZEPPELIN,PINK FLOYD,AC/DC,AEROSMITH,ROLLING STONES AND THE BEATLES INSTEAD.ONE STAR.PS:GUNS N ROSES ARE THE WORST BAND OF ALL TIME.FLOYD FAN"
1,"Aww, what happened Axl, why aren't you popular today?","The best thing about Nirvana and Pearl Jam is that they crushed this crappy band's chances of staying huge through the nineties. G&R stink, always have and always will, and Axl Rose is RACIST!"
2,ehh,"this isnt that good. their missing a lot of key songs. this shouldve been released as a 2 CD set with their other songs as well - i mean these tracks are good and probably their most popular, but guns n roses werent mean for only 80 minutes of good songs - you need maybe 2 discs of 70 minutes each.dont get this cd if youre hardcore into guns n roses - you probably might have all their other cds anyway like me"
4,Guns and Roses CD,Well this is a good cd !! I would recommend this cd to friends And family. It has great hits on it!! And this guy has been around for a long time very happy. KC
1,Whoever told Axl he could sing?,"The best songs on this CD are the cover versions of songs written by other 'artists'...and while the original versions are great, the GnR takes on them suck. They can't even do good songs by other people! And Axl, please stop screeching..."
1,Just not my thing,"November rain is a nive ballad, but I just am not into today,s muxic other than contempory christian. If you want really good music and vocals the Beatles are the best. GodBless"
1,Lost in mail,Inever received this item. No one from Amazon or the Post Office will help me locate it.
1,Its not worth it.,"A true GnR fan would not support something that was against the consent of the band. Of course, these songs are great, even the covers. But go to a cd store and buy ""Appetite"" or the ""Use your Illusion"" series for the same songs AND more. I for one, am insulted because this is likley the last Guns album you will ever see (I am starting to think Chinese Democracy will NEVER be released and besides, thats like GnR2, its not the GOOD Guns, its Axl's final attempt at making himself feel special.) I hate to see a good thing end in an insulting manner. Do yourself a favor and forget the Greatest Hits album."
1,What a waste,"Ironic, isn't it, that GNR's ""Greatest Hits"" are some of their worst songs? I wouldn't accept this CD if someone gave it to me. What a joke. A band that could write absolutely brilliant stuff like ""Welcome To The Jungle"", ""Mr.Brownstone"", ""Rocket Queen"", ""Estranged"", etc. wastes their time covering tired ""dead horses"" (pun intended) like ""Live And Let Die"" and ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door"". And those are their hits (along with, on this CD, two punk covers, too!) Cut the Greatest Hits crap and give us ""Chinese Democracy""!!!!"
1,"Greatest hits, ppphh","Do not, I repeat, DO NOT buy this album. Shur the songs are great but this record is geffens way of milking just a littel more mony out of what was once a good thing. The band members had no say whitch song would go on here and dident get to write any liner notes or nothing. So I'm gonna keep this short and sweet and just tell you not to support this project. Not becouse the music is bad,acctualy these songs are all amazing, but becouse it was relased without the bands concent.Anyways I really want this to blow up in david geffens face, so DO NOT support it!!!!!!!!"
1,Why? Because this welcher NEVER SENT ME THE PRODUCT!!,"I paid for this CD a month ago. I received the other two (bought the same day from different sources within 10 days). But, this guy NEVER SENT. He / She certainly kept my money though!"
5,GnR Greatest Hits,I loved this GnR CD. They are one of my favorite bands and this has all the songs I love.
3,good but could use some work,This is not a greatest hits album.... they didn't even have i used to love her but i had to kill her on there. It downloaded fine and they picked half the album of good songs but it could have used some work. thats just my opinion though.
3,Missing some important songs,"This compilation DOES contain most of the Guns most well-known songs. However, a die-hard fan like myself noticed that some important songs were missing. Here are a few examples:""Estranged""""Nightrain""""Used To Love Her""""The Garden""""My Michelle""If you're new to Guns N Roses, just buy the damned studio albums."
2,If This Is Greatest Hits Why All The Cover Songs???,"well this cd is alright for the first 4 songs, but then it starts getting into terrible cover songs that completely ruin the quality of the original with just plain bad vocals... if you want to get some good guns 'n roses songs download Welcome to the jungle, sweet child o' mine and paradise city.. the rest is just garbage on this cd."
3,Guns N Roses Greatest Hits ?!.....Hmmm?,"When I heard Geffen was bringing out a Greatest Hits album for one of the Greatest rock bands in the world- Guns N Roses, I was over the moon.But when the tracklisting came out I was disappointed.Sure there were the ledgendary Gunners songs off Appetite- Welcome To The Jungle, Paradise City and Sweet Child Of Mine- Great, but this GH album lacked songs such as My Michelle, Mr Brownstone, Nightrain etc.Songs off the UYI albums were poorly represented- November Rain, Dont Cry, Civil War and You Could Be Mine were great choices but selecting the covers of Bob Dylans Knockin On Heavens Door over 14 Years, The Garden, Right Next door to hell, Dust n Bones, and Estranged- WTF?!Not to mention the representation of The Spaghetti Incident?This is a greatest Hits Album not the bands f******g best of our Covers"
5,"Not the best Greatest Hits compelation, but its REMASTERED!","Yeah, yeah, yeah...Geffen could of easily released a much better GNR greatest hits compilation, but the songs are remastered! Man do these songs sound good! I'm a huge GNR fan and I'm pretty much going to buy whatever kind of GNR material comes out, especially if it is remastered! Don't get me wrong though...I do not own the Spaghetti Incident. Although still...damn Geffen could of released a much better GNR greatest hits compilation!"
4,Remastered,"The key word to this release is REMASTERED!!!! Why talk about the songs, I'm sure by the year 2004 you have purchased Appetite, Illusion, etc. It would have been nice to have the original album remastered and released, but if you own a hi-fi system over 5K, get this disc and enjoy the new sonics of the songs you already own. So, stop your useless gibberish and buy this album for 12 bucks."
3,"Great Songs, bad compilation","As many know, the original lineup attempted to stop the release of this collection. This was not an act done out of rebellion, it was done because this collection does not properly represent Guns N' Roses cause. Most of the songs on this album happened to be songs that were released as singles because Geffen forced it. As good as these songs are, putting them all together ruins it because they all sound ""too good"", or too much like number 1 hits. Guns N' Roses did not even have 4 REAL albums, so a collection like this was not neccessary. Buying Lies, Illusions 1&2, and Appetite might cost a bit, but you won't regret it. And if you do, you would have regretted buying this album even more."
4,great g'n'r collection,"This is a great g'n'r compilation featuring the work of this great american hard rock band and contains almost all their hits like WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE,PARADISE CITY,SWEET CHILD OF MINE and NOVEMBER RAIN.It would have been complete if they had included ESTRANGED in this compilation.anyway a great collection."
2,don't get me wrong the songs are great,"This album should have been a double disc. How can Estranged, Rocket Queen, Dead Horse, Coma, Out to Get Me, and many, many others not be included. Anyone who just wants to buy a ""Greatest Hits"" album from GNR would be be completely shafted. You'd be better off buying all the albums except of course Speghetti Incident."
5,GNr Greatest Hits Rocks The World!!!!!,"This is a very great CD this cd rocks the whole world great,and ""Civil War"" is one of the very best by GNR. If you love GNRthen get this CD because it rocks and is better together withtheir debut album ""APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION""."
4,Great album with the hits...,"This album is a decent compilation of their popular hits. Get this if you enjoyed G'N'R back in the day but weren't too deep into them. As a casual listener back then, I myself enjoyed other hits from them as well. But these hits that have been selected are very nostalgic and a great way to introduce G'N'R to people who aren't familiar with their music (mainly your teen kids). A good showcase of their style indeed."
3,Guns N Roses,"Never bought any of these guys albums but always liked several of their songs.This is a good collection except for a couple of copy tunes.I'm against seeing copy songs on a greatest hits collection.To me it's suppose to be an ""original"" collection from that artist."
4,scratched cd?,"Can anyone tell me, is the disc scratched on the top side on purpose?, is that the artwork?, well if it is, it sucks, and also the digipak case.the music is OK you get their hits not the fan favorites, only ""stranged"" missing. 4 stars for the music, 0 stars for the artwork."
1,THIS SERIOUSLY SUCKS!,"First of all its just songs that you can get on thier other albums like Appetite for Destruction. I dont know about any one else but on the cd i got some songs wont even play and one of them is edited... whiched pissed me off. I would give it zero stars, but I can't because the website won't let me. If you want to take my advice, I suggest you DO NOT buy this album, and if someone buys if for you... use it for target practice."
1,"QUEEN ARE GREAT,G'N'R ARE TERRIBLE","PLEASE IGNORE THE REVIEWER BELOW ME( AN ALIAS OF WHIRLIGIG).THE BAND THAT HE HATES ARE GREAT AND THE BANDS HE LIKES STINK EXPLOSIVELY.G'N'R ARE AMONGST THE WORST BANDS WITH PATHETIC SONGS LIKE PARADISE CITY AND WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE.REMEMBER THAT QUEEN AND THE BEATLES ARE LEGENDS AND G'N'R,FOREIGNER AND NIRVANA SUCK."
1,((Overatedd...get something BETTER!)),"Okayy...Axl Rose is possibly THE MOST OVERRATED ""singer"" OF ALL TIME! He has no vocal talent what so EVER! Do yourself a favor...and buy something GOOD! like: LED ZEPPELIN, ACDC, PINK FLOYD, THE DOORS, THE GUESS WHO, THE BEATLES ECT.REAL Rock&& Roll FAN!"
4,Great songs... but a double CD would've been even better,"I think every GN'R fan has been waiting for a compilation, not like Live Era (a Live recorded CD), and this one finally arrived. But making a GN'R compilation may be a really difficult job. They've made so many great songs, this CD can't have all the hits.I agree with another reviewer, Estranged is missing, but that's not the only one hole: Mr Brownstone, Rocket Queen from ""Appetite for Destruction"", Move to the city (Lies), Double Talkin' Jive (UYI I) and Pretty Tied Up, Get in the ring (this one kicked more than an ass!) from UYI II.I'm sure many fans as I, will buy this CD not to complete a collection, because I'm sure many and many people have all the GN'R albums. It will be to have only one CD with many hits, to be carried in the car or a discman."
2,"Just Go Buy ""Appetite""","I thought GnR started their downfall after Appetite for Destruction. Lies stunk. Use Your Illusion was a different band . . . overproduced and overorchestrated. I won't even get into the pasta album.For my money, I say go buy Appetite (GnR's true greatest hits album) and forget this greatest hits.And guys in GnR, if you ever want to have a career again, get the original band back, including Adler."
4,Awsome Disc,"Great Disc as soon as I heard it was comming out I had to get it, The Disc could of included a few more songs like Estranged and Garden of Eden, but maybe this means there will be a volume 2, none the less the disc was not disapointing"
3,BAH...,"Putting this in my CD player today I'm realizing exactly how awesome this compilation album is NOT. As far as I'm concerned this should deffinately be a 2 disk set. Granted, it has many great songs that should be there but there are also many great songs missing from it as well. In my opinion that makes it just a hits compilation and not a GREATEST hits compilation.I can only hope that they do release a better greatest hits album some day... either that or I could suck it up and buy the Use Your Illusion albums."
3,"I like my GnR more ""raw"" and explicit...","It's the more popular songs, but ""true"" fans are left wondering where are the more ""raw"" songs that defined their talents and created their image as one of the best HardRock bands of all time.They should have come out with an album titled ""Side B"" or ""The Otherside of GnR"" and inlcuded awesome songs like Don't Damn Me, Back Off Bitch, One in a Million, Estranged, Rocket Queen, etc.Also, when I buy an ""EXPLICIT"" album, I expect to hear the artist's lyrics come through as it was meant to be, in all its glory, with all the emotions and meaning behind it. Editing out a controversial word in the 3rd verse of ""Aint It Fun"" is a joke. That alone makes this album worth passing on and just going straight to the real thing.GNR FOREVER!"
4,Very good,G&R's Greatest Hits album was great. I enjoyed it for many reasons....first off because I heard some songs that I never gave a chance to before and then I ended up liking them. Not only that but the album has an okay collection of G&R's hits. I'm sure not many G&R fans would like this (mostly because they mainly list songs that were played on the radio and such) but this album wasn't horrible or anything. I wish there were a few more songs added to it but it was well put together overall.
3,Good Hits Package...Until Last 2 Songs,"Well they messed up a could've been a ""great"" greatest hits cd (what's new).How in the world could you leave off ""Mr Brownstone"" from the ""Appetite.."" album? They are nuts to leave that hit off.And my all time favorite GNR song,""Estranged"".They should have left off ""Sympathy For The Devil"" and ""Since I Don't Have You"" both being the lamest songs on here.And added something else like a true single(s).I know they were cramped for space since most cds only have 80 minutes worth of space.Throw in a edit somewhere couldve worked.But anyways you still get the big hits all around.Like always they gotta use the stupid digi-pak for this one.I dont like my cd cover getting ruined, why don't they understand that.(I know it's cheaper for them to make cardboard.)This cd would've been out sooner but frontman Axl Rose threw a fit over the release of it,so did the rest of the former members.Anyways GNR gave the rights away to use their songs used in tv ads,movies,radio,etc."
5,Guns N' Roses - One Of The All Time Greats,"This compilation is really great. Contains great songs, Civil War, November Rain, & Paradise City. Probably the greatest heavymetal compilation of all time."
4,One of our favorites ???,"Admittedly, Guns N Roses is one of the best bands ever, however I was a little disappointed in this Greatest Hits CD. They easily could have filled 2 CD's with songs, but didn't. It just gave the feeling that this CD was kind of thrown together and put out on the market. Love this band though!"
2,could be much better,"i dislike the songs chosen for their greatest hits. bottom line, if you were asked to choose gn'r's greatest album, would you choose appetite for destruction or use your illusion (I or II)? a true gn'r fan knows the answer to that is clearly appetite. so then why is there only 3 songs off appetite and 7 off the use your illusions? 'yesterdays' instead of 'mr. brownstone'? 'you could me mine' over 'nighttrain'? please. that's insulting."
5,$ .25!,"hey Axel, here's a Quarter... call someone who cares - yes that's as old as, well these songs, but if your old enough to remember when a pay-phone cost a quarter - then you probably remember some of these songs from the good ol' days (and if you don't know what a pay phone is, and no it ain't the toy in your pocket - then consider this album an essential and affordable history lesson on late 80's Rock)"
4,sweet child,"I bought this album for the song; sweet child of mine. This is one of the songs I remember hearing on the radio but couldn't remember who the artist was. A good find for me. All the songs on the CD are of good quality, no distortions."
5,GREATEST HITS-DYNAMITE STUFF,"Another fantastic album by Guns n Roses. I'm an old geezer that thrives not onlyon '60's rock but also truly appreciates groups like this one.Glad they included Sweet Child of Mine, one of my favorites."
3,I've had better,"The songs in the beginning are great then it gets boring. I had an album of theirs years ago and I thought this one was it, but it wasn't. So my search continues. This one is not worth the money."
4,There once was a great band.......,"Well, this is basically your typical ""Greatest Hits"" album, nothing too suprising, just most of what should be here. A few of my personal faves are missing, but they were never hits anyway (Rocket Queen, Used To Love Her). Otherwise included is ""Welcome To The Jungle"", ""Patience"", ""November Rain"", ""Don't Cry"", and of course ""Sweet Child O' Mine"". My only real complaint is the inclusion of FIVE covers, not that they're bad, but come on. Overall it's a good collection though, and will go great next to your ""Motley Crue"" and ""Def Leppard"" best of's."
3,Terrible song selection,"I guess that comes from the fact that this is an album of ""singles"", and the singles GNR chose off of the Use Your Illusion albums were mostly very poor choices. But come on, there are 5 cover songs on this so called ""Greatest Hits"" album. Two of the few singles off of UYI that they got right, Estranged (one of the greatest rock songs ever written) and The Garden, are nowhere to be found. Since they insist on using ""singles"", why not put It's So Easy from AFD?"
2,Fraud!,"Where is Dust N Bones/Hair of the Dog/Mr.Brownstone? Thisalbum is just a clear attempt to get some money. I can'tbelieve anybody would break down and buy this! The oversong ""Knockin on Heavens Door"" doesn't even belong! Itwas one the subpar songs they did."
1,why,"if you didnt buy this, they may actually have to release an actual album. how ridiculous, if you own appetite, why would you buy this?"
2,Makes me wonder.,"This CD isn't a greatest hits, where the band is concerned. It's a greatest hits that their label, Geffen, thought was appropriate.Sorry, listening to those songs again makes me wonder what a REAL greatest hits would actually sound like, and feel like.This is an attempt at Geffen to make some money on a dead band.Well, perhaps it's not all dead... Maybe one day Axl will get off of his lazy ass and release Chinese Democracy and show us all once again what Guns N' Roses was, and should be."
5,Extreme toughness and many functions.,"So, I've had this watch for a couple of days. I've been wearing analogs for pretty much my entire adult life. I made the decision to move to a digital because of this watch. I wanted a tough watch that had an alarm (this one has 5) and that would last. The thing that REALLY sold me was that this watch is solar powered. I consider myself a ""prepper"" and so I look for products that will last for as long as possible with minimal interaction.There are so many extras on this watch. First the nylon strap is a great thing because it can be readily replaced. World time for travelers. 30 ""pages"" of data can be filled with important numbers. Automatic backlight (for righties only :( unfortunately). Just a lot packed into this thing.I encourage you to go look at the Casio G-Shock homepage. These are really nigh on indestructible watches and they are also very light. I've been wearing mine for 3 days non-stop and barely even noticed.Top notch, I highly recommend it."
1,ok watch,I am happy with this watch so far. It has a band that is not as tough as the other casio watches. Tis is a plus because I dont feel that it is there all the time. The bad part is it feels like its not as strong and wont hold up in the water. It came loose a couple of times I have used it and had to tighten it. Other then this the watch has the data info part of the watch which I dont use. The buttons are hard to push down at times to get a response. I have to shack the watch at time to get the light to come on automaticly. But the back light seems to be stronger then I noticed on other watches. A wish is the World time to be set in 2 time zones like some of the other watches. All around this seems like a good watch and I am happy with it. the solar source is great also. 5ts a good buy. I lost this watch and got another. This time the watch broke at the band and the watch a week after the order came in. I cant belive this! The toughest watch broke putting it on
3,BUEN DISCO,LA SELECCION ES BUENA SI BIEN ES CIERTO QUE LAS PISTAS NO SON ORIGINALES ESTAN BIEN SECUENCIADAS (MIXADAS) PERO HAY CIERTOS TEMAS QUE SON DE RELLENO
4,Oy. This one you should buy already.,"Observe and honor the basics of running a Jewish household, as retold in this easy-to-read book. If you've ever wondered why/when or how many of our traditions began, you'll enjoy, believe me. It provided wonderful insights into some of the traditions we observed in my parents home and has brought new meaning to observing them anew. Try it. You'll like it."
3,All the ones I could,"I thought it was OK, I was curious to hear other songs from Sumo since I only knew the After Chabon album. (Do you have that one ?)"
3,meh,"once you get passed how cheesy the video is, it's actually kind of nice. it just walks you through a massage both for the women and the men. the oil it comes with has a weird texture, it makes everything kind of sticky so I would get different massage oil. never listened to the cd or used the incense...just mainly got it for the video"
5,I LOVE CHALEE TENNISON'S MUSIC,I GOT TO SEE CHALEE THIS YEAR TWICE MY DAUGHTER GOT TO TALK TO HER AND GET SOME PICTURES WITH HER. SHE IS A BEAUTIFUL PERSON AND A WONDERFUL SINGER. HER STORY IS LIKE MY I THINK WE COULD BE TWINS. I FEEL THE PAIN SHE HAS GONE THROUGH THE SAME PAIN I FELT. I THINK SHE DOES COUNTRY MUSIC GREAT
3,Disappointed,"After reading all of the five star reviews that listeners gave this album, I was disappointed. Overall it is pretty average. Chalee should have recorded more of her own songs. The one that she is listed as co-writer for, Someone Else's Turn to Cry is by far the best on the CD. If you only buy one country cd this year, buy Danni Leigh's 29 Nights. If you can afford several include Chalee Tennison."
3,This one hooked me.,"Usually I'd pass over a CD by a country rock chick. But I happened to hear the ballad ""Just Because She Lives There"" on the radio & it had so much emotion in it that I wanted to hear it again. The other ballads on here were forgettable, but Chalee has a strong voice and puts it to good use on the rockin' tunes ""Handful of Water"", ""Sometimes"", and the attitude laden ""A Stolen Car""."
4,Surprise,This album was quite surprise for me. I thought Seru Giran was the only good rock band on Argentina scene. This blokes are good musicians with good vocals and nice songs. Keep going.
4,Finally the wait is over...but,"This is a review of the film and not this DVD release. This musical was restored with missing scenes on laser disc some time ago. I saw the movie in a theater a long time ago (1973 was it, really???) and loved it. Hense, I was glad to get it in its ""restored"" form on laser disc. My heart, too, was touched by the ""message"" of this movie musical. I was so glad they restored missing scenes (picked right up off the cutting room floor with dirt, scratches, and all) and I'm so glad to see it finally reach DVD release. I do know that the film was ""scope"" and am wondering if it is a mistake to list its aspect ratio as 1.33 to 1 by Amazon. Surely they would not do this to a film that has been such a long time coming to DVD format. But they did it to ""Annie"" so you never know. Also I'm wondering if this DVD ""release"" has the restored scenes included? If someone who has purchased this DVD release could please clear up these two issues, it would be appreciated."
3,Love the musice,I have always enjoyed this film. The original is not a musical and I have it to just for history's sake. but I love this musical
5,Loved it,It was great. It is so beautiful and it puts me at peace to see a place like this and imagine.
3,Lost Horizon,"The movie was the one I remembered but the Dvd itself had no writting on it, kinda like a pirated copy which disappointed mel"
4,Great Musical Score - Great for kids,I saw this movie when it first came out and immediately bought the soundtrack and memorized many of the songs. I have lost the soundtrack and would love to get another copy on CD and would love to own the dvd of this if they ever make it. Kids would love this movie and adults that will let themselves be kids will also love it.
5,JUST BEAUTIFUL,Having seen this in the cinema on original release I was always surprised why it was panned and then mutilated for later releases. Even recently there was a showing on UK TV but it was the edited version and was completely ruined. Even Bobby Van`s quirky `Question me an answer`song was cut. Bobby sadly died in 1980 and it is fantastic to have the restored full version. I would have liked a Blu Ray but having said that the transfer is stunning and really looked superb played on a Blu Ray upscaler on a HD projector on the big screen. Projection always shows any transfer defects or lower quality but it was just beautiful.My recommendation buy it whilst it is available and before it becomes `Lost` Horizon once more.
4,Lost and Now Found,"Ross Hunter was the master of the big budget, glossy, spend the money entertainment. (See ""Airport"", ""Pillow Talk"", ""Madame X"", ""Flower Drum Song""). The film was much ballyhooed when it first came out and was a dud and cut to a shorter version for general release. Looking forward to the complete version.Yes, making it into a musical was maybe not the right choice, but the music is fun and it's a perfect ""big budget non-think"" entertainment. That being said, the cast, production design, cinematography, special effects(esp. matte work) and costumes are five stars, and the film moves! Looking forward to the remastered 5.1 edition.Thank you Sony for finally releasing this after almost forty years.The studios are finally figuring out there's a market for some of these older films through their ""Archive-Vault-Classics"" collections. Thank you to Amazon for making these films available."
5,A great Musical Drama,"I rate this Movie a 5 star production. In my opinion this production of Lost Horizon rates to be one of the finest Musical Dramas in the latter part of the Twentieth Century. The efforts of Ross Hunter, Burt Bacharach and Hal David along with the Cast were impeccable in this Production.I am so very thankful to Sony Pictures and Columbia Pictures for resurrecting ""Lost Horizon"" and making it available to the pubic once again. Over the last two decades I've been researching, writing and Emailing TV networks and studios looking for this production of Lost Horizon on DVD/BlueRay. Again, thanks to those responsible for fulfilling my dream of having a copy of this Movie to enjoy over and over again."
1,Radio edit is not the real radio edit,"I bought this CD specifically for the Radio Edit to include in a video. The first line should be 'I can be a nightmare of the grandest kind' but instead is the true version of the song, ' I can be an ***hole of the grandest kind'. I'm disappointed."
2,Stupid design,"I don't know what idiot designed this thing but they should get into another line of work. As the other reviewers said, it's very difficult to program. Why they couldn't have used DIP switches like the rest of the world I'll never know. When you have to change the batteries you have to reprogram it from scratch - not only does it not remember your settings, but the defaults are useless. By default it only leaves the light on for 1 minute, and it triggers day or night. To add insult to injury, the screws for mounting the thing are UNDER the batteries. You can't take it down, program it, and remount it because to mount it you have to take out the batteries and once the batteries are taken out it loses its programming. A bank of 8 DP switches would make this product a winner but the current design is a loser."
1,Less Distance on Motion Detection--than Older Model,"This unit is not nearly as effective as the 9-year-old SmartHome unit it replaced. The distance it reliably detects motion is about 12 feet, one third that of the SmartHome unit, which did not have the adjustable delay control on top. And when I tried to locate it 15 feet further from the receiver, its signal no longer was strong enough to be detected. Also, the small rubber button that seals the delay control does not stay in place and was easily lost in handling. And, further, the negative pole battery springs had to be stretched to get a reliable contact."
3,for the kingsmen fan who must have it all.,"This is a mixture of the kingsmen live in 1967 and earlier. It doesn't have any of their classic hits like: 'louie louie' , 'that's cool that's trash"" , 'long green' ,'jolly green giant"" , the sound quality is decent but the disc is for completists only. The band made some great frat garage rock in it's heyday. This was the band as it was at it's end. Still it's not a bad disc; it's just not a great kingsmen disc , their earlier discs are alot more fun. And should be bought first. This one is a good live show from the late sixties but without any hits it's truly a rarities type release for kingsmen fans who want everything."
4,One of the better books about Seinfeld,"Jerry Seinfeld: the Entire Domain (1998 Birch Lane Press, written by Kathleen Tracy) Perhaps the best biography to date, if in part because it's the most recent and even covers some post-TV show stuff. More oriented towards Jerry's professional life than his personal history, it almost seems at times to be a biography of the career, not the person. But there is plenty of info on Jerry's private life, his loves, his ambitions, etc. But the TV show is the reason to read this book. Tracy takes us through the entire 9 year run from conception to Finale, with lots of FAQworthy tidbits and includes an episode guide at the end. There's also a 12-page color photo section included as an added bonus."
5,"Excellent, Covers the Entire Seinfeld Need to Know Domain!","This is not so much an autobiography on Jerry, but more on the Seinfeld show. Everyone from Jerry, Larry David as well as the other cast member's backgrounds are included as well as how the show was pitched to NBC and the hurdles that had to be overcome before it was a success.There are a few colour photographs in the middle as well as an index at the back. Each year of the show has a commentary of what happened both on the show and behind the scenes and how the fans reacted. Also what was going on in the star's lives at the time. A summary of each episode, who was in it, directed it and so on is also in the back of the book. Also talks about his previous book Sein Language and CD Telling You for the Last Time.This is a must for anyone who enjoyed one of the funniest and best shows ever made."
5,Greatest Hits album that's worth the money,"I used not to like Dwight Yoakam's music that much till a few years ago and now he's one of my favorite country artists. Just about all of these songs are great for any country fan. ""Ain't That Lonely Yet"" and ""Thousand Miles From Nowhere"" are probably my 2 favorites. The remake of ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love"" is also good.Dwight Yoakam has been criticized cause he came from California and he's different than most country singers, but if you ask me, I say that it's good country just like some of the other most popular singers. I recommend getting this album if you're a Dwight Yoakam fan or just like good, slow country music."
5,Great CD,Exactly what we wanted. My husband is a big Dwight Yokum fan and really enjoys the CD. Thanks a lot
5,EXCELLENT!! I WANT TO SEE HIM IN CONCERT NOW!,"I have always loved Dwight - however, this is my first CD I bought of his. I absolutely love it! Every song is great - - I want to buy the other CDs right now. I wish this one had These Arms on it!! I just got it in the mail today and am listening to it for the second time tonight. I am definitely going to try and see him next month when he is in town!!! I never thought I would write a review - - but I just had to! I am so ""pumped"" just listening to this CD!!"
4,Dwight's still got it!!,"Dwight's new greatest hits collection is a must buy! I still believe he is probably the best male country singer/artist out there. He sure can ROCK when he wants to, and that's what I love about him!! The new songs are good, especially ""Crazy Little Thing"", and the old favorites ""Ain't that lonely, Turn it up, You're the one, Suspicious minds, and Gone"" still sound great!! I only found one flaw with this album, when it did not include ""Things Change""! Other than that, it sure is close to Perfect!!"
5,I had Listened To This CD.,It Is a great cd. I Have Been A Dwight Fan Since 1986. I Like All Of His Songs. Try Not To Look So Pretty and Things Change Are Not On This CD. But there are tracks that like on this cd.
5,Safer if you have Cats,"My little cat Meesa is notorious for sniffing at candles while they are burning. Since this was a big worry I decided to buy something where the candle was partially enclosed. This beautiful oil burner was a good solution and is a much safer option if you have cats.The top of the oil burner can be filled with water and your favorite essential oils. My current favorite is The Body Shop Gingerbread Home Fragrance Oil but I also enjoy using Aura Cacia - Essential Solutions, Love Potion .5 Oz andAura Cacia Fir Needle, Balsam Essential Oil Canada .5 oz.If you are looking for something that will disperse your essential oils all throughout your home then this oil burner is an excellent choice. I can also highly recommend the following candles:Dozen Soy Tealight Candles. They are soy candles and last longer than other regular tea lights and come in a variety of scents that you can mix and match with your essential oils.~The Rebecca Review"
4,no big hits but great garage rock of it's era.,"Kller joe"" and 'little sally tease' got some radio play but the release had no real big hits as earlier releases did. In fact the band was breaking up and their type of wild organ pumping garage rock was being replaced on the airwaves but more brit invasion type of music. However it's sad that programmers couldn't see that there was still room for this type of rock on the airwaves. Why not? it was fun and pure party rock mainly. If you like great early sixties party rock or frat rock then this is a good addition to your collection. If you just want a greatest hits type of sample then don't buy this one though. However 'killer joe' and other songs are as good as anything they did before and frat rock was good fun. SO get rockin."
4,"where's the original 12"" version of ""It's like that"" ?","I bought the original Run-D.M.C. 12"" single It's like that back when it first came out and then Hard Times, Rock Box, etc. and I also bought their first 2 albums on vinyl but what I didn't like then is the same thing I don't like now - they put a short edited version of It's Like That on the album. Since they remastered and reissued this album now with bonus tracks, wouldn't it have been logical to put the original 7+ minutes 12"" version of It's like that on the CD? I believe that Hard Times is the same length on the album as it is on the 12"" single. I have only seen the original 12"" length version on a compilation album called Hip Hop Greats which I believe is available here on Amazon. Anyway, I give this new remastered digipak version 4 stars because they omitted the 12"" version of It's like that."
3,CLASSIC PIONEERS' RAP ALBUM,"Run-DMC's debut album is a classic pioneering recording,and when you listen to this album,you'll learn to appreciate rap and its pioneers even more.Sure,the beats arent the best ever made,but keep in mind while listening when the album was made.The best song on this album is the hard beats and guitar riffs track,""Rock Box"" this album is worth your money simply for this song.Another song that is great is ""It's Like That"".Run-DMC and Jam-Master Jay mastered the beats and well written lyrics on this track.The other songs arent exactally the best,but are pretty good for an early rap album.If you want a pretty good album from one of the best pioneer old school groups of rap,get this album.But if you want one of there better works,i suggest getting ""Raising Hell""."
4,"Some Good Tracks, Some Great Ones....","A solid tribute album. Some weak tracks (""I Don't Live Today,"" ""House Burning Down""), but some real gems, too (""Little Wing,"" ""Hey Joe""). Overall, a substantial and heartfealt tribute to the Master, who would have been 60 this year - that's a birthday party I would have loved to attend...."
5,Diamond in the Rough,I purchased this CD for my daughter that is a new mother in the USA. She asked me if there was a way to find this for her as she listened to this as a little girl back in the early 80s. She loved Charlotte Diamond. I was thrilled that I was able to find it. Thanks!! AMAZON
2,a bit disappointed,"I thought about getting one as a baptism gift, but I wasn't too impressed with it...the little animals are kind of cute, but the text leaves something to be desired; each story gets a short blurb and that's about it. It's a Reader's Digest book; that should have warned me. I know toddlers have short attention spans, but not THAT short. My niece is nine months old and likes to be read longer, sustained pieces."
4,great bargain,"I bought this chainsaw as a replacement for a homelite chainsaw that my husband liked for years. It didn't come with any cover as it said it would, but the chainsaw was just what he wanted and works great. He has been really happy with it. Great price."
2,Pay the extra money,"I just bought a Homelite chain saw at Home Depot. It lasted for an hour on a big tree I was cutting then just died. Before it died, the chain flew off four times even when it was tight. Also, the muffler is in a bad spot and I burnt my finger trying to fix the chain. Needless to say, it went back to Home Depot and I purchased a Echo chain saw. Works like a dream. It was an extra 100 bucks but you can tell and see the difference in quality and performance. Also the muffler is hidden and it is super easy to handle. Also quiet. Lesson learned again. Do not be a cheap skate. Pay the extra money and get the better quality item."
5,Think new,"The saw arrived and looked like a new saw. I have used it now for about 10 hours and it is running and cutting perfectly. It is a bit harder to start than the identical model saw that it replaced, especially after it has been running a while. But I could not be more pleased with the way it is working."
4,Had Homelite Chainsaw for 5 years Now,"I have had a 16"" Ranger for over 5 years and am pleased with the performance. We had a destructive winter storm here in NY and I needed to cut up trees and tree limbs that had fallen. I put a new chain on as the old one was dull (and I didn't want to spend the time sharpening. The chainsaw worked fine, strong and easy starting. I agree with the comments about chain oil usage. I bought a less viscous oil at Home Depot than I had been using and found that I was really going through the oil (Echo). This is OK as it protects better. My unit was purchased new and came with sharpening files (never used!), tool and case. This is good for medium duty. I would purchase again."
3,homelite chain saw,"the oil and gas fill openings are in a bad place, they leak! Particularly the chain oil cap. The saw is heaver and the spark plug is harder to access than in my old 2x. This saw is OK, but just Ok. If I had seen it , I wouldn't have bought it! RB"
1,Piece of Junk,"Unit arrived quickly, installed chainbar and chain. Could not get it started. Called Amazon to return this piece of junk, was advised to take it to a Homelite Service Center. Drove 15 miles and was told by service center that they can't even look at it for at least a month. So now I have this new chainsaw that is utterly useless to me. DON""T BUY!!Walt"
2,Little chain saw,"The saw is the next smaller one than the one I thought I wanted. It was all there, starts and runs well, cuts pretty slow, but it is a small saw."
2,Poor Workmanship,"My wife bought me this for my birthday. It ran ok the first few times but was hard to start. I thought it was a little sluggish for a 33cc motor. I fell a few trees, small oaks and a decent sized hickory and couldn't keep the chain on or sharp. I replaced the bar and chain (with OEM) but still had problems. The following spring, after a tornado blew through and leveled some trees in our neighborhood, I couldn't get it to start at all. Sprayed some carb cleaner and starting fluid in it and got it to start but it died after a few seconds. I took it to the local shop to have them look at it and the bolts were sheared off in the head with no way of getting them out. I scrapped the saw and bought a used Craftsman, using the Homelite for spare parts. The next ""new saw"" I buy will NOT be another Homelite."
2,2 Big Leakers,The Homelite chainsaw is not a good buy! If you want to have chain oil leaking like a dyke all over everything...I complained about the first one and Amazon was nice enough to send a 2nd.(Amazon does not have a return policy for chainsaws of this nature) The 2nd also leak worst. I don't recommend this chainsaw! As it was first advertised with chainsaw case and was not is how it all started.
1,"complete junk, basically a toy",I put roughly several hours on this poorly made and designed 'toy'. I ran 91 octane fuel with Castrol TTS synthetic oil mixed at 40:1. The chainsaw stopped running in the middle of a job. I pulled the plug to discover that there was very little compression and scoring on the cylinder wall. Don't waste you're time on this Chinese junk.
2,No discretion,"When a musician converts to Christianity, why does every song he composes have to be about religion? Other musos become Buddhists, Muslims, Catholics, etc and are able to continue their musical lives without proselytizing, why can't Mark Farner?It really limits the music's appeal, in fact I'd say this type of 'Christian music' has zero appeal for anyone but born-again Christians.Long live Grand Funk."
4,Good second choice cereal,Frosted Flakes is a good sugary cereal option from time to time when there is no Life or Kix on sale.
5,The Greatest Hip-Hop Album of all time (or at least top 3),"Simply stated, Raising Hell is one of the greatest albums of all time. People who are new to hip-hop, just don't know what true hip-hop is until the have heard this and other classics. Current artists could use this as a lesson on originality. Please get more copies---I want one!"
4,Rap at its best,"Straight off, there are 3 killer tracks here 'It's tricky', Walk this way, and You be illin. The original version of it's tricky (which is found here) is heaps better than the version released in 1998. The only other song that comes close to the above mentioned is 'Dumb Girl' which is catchy. But the fierce beats on this CD make up for the rest of the tracks. Check out RUN DMC to hear the original masters of rap/metal, the only other band that can match them in rap/metal is Rage Against the Machine."
4,Good intro,"This one is a bit more on the info science side of things, but is quite good. It is an intro to IR which, like IO, can be a tricky subject to talk about. I thought the author did quite well and the use of diagrams when talking about IR algorithms was a big plus.There are some chapters that are not as relevant as others, but overall, a great text."
3,it's a textbook-I had to buy it for a class,"So far, it seems to be helpful for the class it was required for. $90.00 for a paperback book is really sad, though."
3,Nobody but you,"This was The Turtles second album. It was sort of a mixed bag. It features a mixture of the folk rock type songs of theirfirst album, and the more pop sound of their then recent hit, ""You Baby"". There are some good songs here, but there are also some mediocre songs. To be frank, most of the songs that the group wrote themselves aren't good. They fare better on the songs from outside songwriters. The CD version adds two bonus tracks, the non-hit (but great) singles ""Outside Chance"" and ""Can I Get To Know You Better"". I should mention that the album was recorded in binaural (two-track) stereo. That means that the vocals are in one speaker and the instruments are in the other speaker. If you have heard the stereo versions of The Beatles earliest albums, you know what I mean."
1,Economical,All of the original old stories at a fraction of the cost. No pictures inside. If you're not a collector and just want the stories then this is the one.
4,Unearthed,"I finally got my copy of this boxed set. I own all of the regular American Recordings, and really wish that the fifth disc was either left out, or included some more hard-to-find stuff. I don't think that I'll ever remove it from the sleeve... which brings me to the packaging. I really like the compact size. I had no idea what the set looked like and was expecting a big box the size of an LP, so I was really happy when I opened the Amazon box and saw the packaging. However, I dislike the stiff cardboard sleeves that hold the discs. You can't help touching the discs as you try to get them out of the sleeves. They should have made a longer notch on the backs of the sleeves so you could get a finger in the hole of the disc to remove it.I love the music and discs 1-4 are worth the price of the box. 1 star off for the packaging and the useless 5th disc."
5,Johnny Cash: Unearthed,"This album is a must have for Cash Fans. Most of the collection is comprised of previously unrecorded music wherein Cash plays solo guitar, unaccompanied by anyone else. Many songs were recorded in a primitive-looking cabin in very basic surroundings. Despite the unsophisticated simplicity of the recording techniques, the music captures the essence of Johnny Cash; harsh vocals that sing soulfully about the human condition. The collection of music was recorded prior to his death in 2003 and is one of my favorite sets of his music."
3,lose disc 5 and pick up another star,"As several reviewers have noted here, the fifth disc, a ""best of"" compilation from Cash's first four Ameican releases, doesn't belong in this ""Unearthed"" collection at all. The audience for what is otherwise a four-CD box set of previously unreleased material is the same audience that already has ""American Recordings"", ""Unchained"", ""Solitary Man"" and ""The Man Comes Around"". That much should have been obvious to everyone at American, and so it is equally obvious that including this disc was a cheap record company move to raise the retail price of the set.American should reissue this without the superfluous fifth disc and give Johnny Cash and his fans the final statement box set that he and we deserve."
3,Have Someone Make You a Copy.....,"....of the first disc. It is every bit as good as American I (my favorite of the Cash-American series), and perhaps even better. Discs 2-4 have some gems, but you have to search for them. Johnny's colab with Tom Petty just doesn't work IMHO (Disc 2). The Heartbreakers are a great band, really excelling with Dylan, but there's not enough edge to their sound with Johnny. The gospel tracks are fine, and some of the duets work, some of them don't.I have to agree about the ""money-grab"" aspect of Disc 5. People who want the first 4 don't want 5, and someone who wants 5 probably doesn't want the other 4. Also, how could ""Personal Jesus"" be omitted from a Greatest Hits?"
5,I liked Johnny...,"...and I still like Johnny Cash. As I write this, having just recieved the box set today, it's playing in the bakground. It's outstanding, get it. If you buy and sell, if you exchange money for ""things"", and who doesn't, these are funds well appropriated."
3,5th Disc is a turnoff,"I'm dying to get this set. I'm sure it's unbelievably great. But the fifth disc is a real turn-off. Anyone buying this will already own everything on this fifth disc.Why don't they issue the first three discs individually like they did with the fourth disc (My Mother's Hymnbook)? I'd buy all four on the first day of release.I just hate rip-off projects like this one. It just doesn't make sense. It's almost as bad as the Beatles ""Capitol Albums"" ripoff."
5,Make sure you see the forest...,This whole collection is amazing. I just can't believe some of the half-wit wanna-be music critics on this thread. Anything less than five stars is just plain nuts.
5,Wow!!!!!! Worth every penny!!!,"Like the other reviewers, I figured the music here would be second rate since it didnt'make the original cd's. Big mistake. Every song here is top rate.My only complaint is the booklet the cd's come in. They are like the ones that 78's used to come in. They require you to touch the music side of the disc. And I'm guessing after a few years of listening, the pages that hold the cd's will be nothing but memories.The booklet that comes with the cd's is awesome. It has comments from Johnny on every single song."
3,I agree about the 5th disc...,"but given that it's there, why not share with a friend who may not realize the amazing talent that Cash was? I've got one friend who I'm planning on giving Disc 5 to once I get the box set."
4,Decent deal,"This is not a high end microcomponent but something basic to enjoy your music -MP3 and CD's- without worries. If you're a big fan of HI-FI audio, this system is not for you. The equalizer offers bass and treble adjustment only. Size and appearance are stylish. Overall, a decent deal."
4,Not bad for $100,"I like to keep these things short, so...basically everything is great, except for:- no alarm clock- Blue-tooth feature is not very straight-forward, I had to RTFM to figure it out.I'd give it 5 stars if I could use the radio/CD player as an alarm clock :)"
4,A heavy metal classic!,"Don't know about the new songs but this album is truly a heavy metal classic. Good from the beginning till the end. Bref, a good album with good songs. No fillers."
3,Comedy & Tragedy,"A very good album, but not as good as ""Shout"". To me, this is when the Crue started to lose it. Of course, ""Home Sweet Home"" can't be denied as one of the most successful power ballads of all time but the rest of the disc isn't as good. ""Smokin'"" is a decent cover but seemed to get old fast. ""Louder Than Hell"" is actually a really good track on the disc. Definately worth a listen, especially for Crue fans. Not as good as ""Shout"" but not a disaster like ""Girls""."
2,"""Theatre"" has LITTLE to do with bluesy rock","This album is another unfortunate product of the direction glam metal took a competent rock band during the 1980s. In 1985 the Crue were poised to release the follow-up to the metal classic ""Shout"". Instead of a great album fans got a great single, the MTV ballad ""Home Sweet Home"".Much of this album is tiresome. Silly chants that could have come from a scribe with much less skill than Nikki Sixx. But it fit the era of glitter and make up. I'm just thankful they gave up that ... before ""Girls Girls Girls"""
3,weak,"This is Crue's weakest album. It has 2, maybe 3 decent songs, but honestly, the album is quite boring. Shout at the devil/too fast for love are awesome. Girls/Dr feelgood are good. This one is just too dull."
3,Raise Your Hands To Rock ...!,This is a part of my life. I graduated HS in 1986 and this cd was IT for me. Of coarse as we grow up and learn how music is put together we learn how some of our hero's fudged a bit. Looking back I now realise this CD was good but not great and was probably as good as it could have been considering (According to the VH-1 Behind the Music) the band was in serious trouble with booze and drugs as the BIG money had just started to roll in on this CD. I am writing this review really because of the bonus tracks ... if you own this cd (AND are a HUGE MOTLEY fan like me) w/o the bonus tracks sell it and get this one. The Home Sweet Demo is so pure! And the best part is you can actually hear Nikki! WOW! The City Boy Blues Demo should have been the real version with it's rawness ...! Get this disc here @ Amazon!
2,Dissapointing,"I was 15 yrs old when this ""Record"" hit the stores. I was a huge Crue fan with heavy anticipations for this new Crue collaboration. TOO FAST FOR LOVE, and SHOUT AT THE DEVIL were loud, rebellious, and all around heavy. My first impression was the bands new appearance, my reaction, ""Oh man! What did they do?"". The songs did not meet the expectations I had either, although there are a couple of great songs like LOUDER THAN HELL, TONIGHT(WE NEED A LOVER)""90,000 screaming watts, Honey drippin' from her top""(A classic opening line to a song). But all in all, this CD is not their best..although it was a good effort to get airplay, and MTV ratings. It brought forth a new generation of Crue fans to follow. If you want loud, raw, and fast metal, see TO FAST FOR LOVE, AND SHOUT AT THE DEVIL."
3,Even the Worst of The Crue CDs is a Fun CD to Blast!,"Sure this CD has not only been bashed by fans, but even The Crue themselves. The Crue members have said out of their own mouths that this CD is total garbage with the exception of the two singles. Now, I personally think The Crue are just dissapointed how they could have done much better and that it wasn't up to par with the two prior releases, because it's really not a BAD CD, I think it's got some great fun songs on here. Problem basically is, this CD is the lowest of the low for the Crue...Vince was arrested for manslaughter, they were all fxcked up on drugs and stuff was just not good. The songs are uninspired and sound very repetitive and simplistic. None the less, it's a fun CD and Crue fans will most likely enjoy it. It's not the best but it deserves more respect than some give it."
2,Theatre of Pain,"1985's Theatre of Pain was the first big hit for Motley Crue. It had two hit singles with a cover of the Brownsville Station's Smoking in the Boys Room and Home Sweet Home. Those are both fine songs, but both can be found on the various greatest hits albums the Crue has, other than those two tracks I would say City Boy Blues is good,other than that this album has nothing to offer."
4,"Good album, not quite up to par though.","I wrote a previous review and gave it a 3, but just yesterday I gave this album a real listen and thought it was good. The sound is a little muted and the guitar has the same sounds on each song, Vince's voice is herrendous, and Tommy's drums are o.k, but all bad things aside, this album has it's good sides too. For the most part the lyrics are good, and the songs are kept short before they get boring. The music is sort of bluesy, which is a plus. The best songs are City Boy Blues, which has a great bluesy feel to it, Smokin' in the Boys' Room, which is a pure fun song, Louder Than Hell, which has great lyrics, Home Sweet Home, which is the Crue's first ballad and it scores, Use It Or Lose It, which is a pounding song, and Raise Your Hands To Rock, which has a pretty cool acoustic riff to it. The rest are o.k songs. Like I said before, buy Dr. Feelgood before you buy this, but this album is a good representation of the old Crue, and a hint of the Crue to come."
3,"NOT A BAD ALBUM, BUT.............","THIS IS NOT A BAD ALBUM, CITY BOY BLUES AND LOUDER THAN HELL AND SAVE OUR SOULS ROCK. THIS ALBUM IN MY OPINION WAS OVER PRODUCED. IT IS NOT AS HEAVY AS TOO FAST OR SHOUT. THEATRE OF PAIN IS A BLUESY ROCK ALBUM."
3,glammed up crue,"3 1/2 stars. This is another Crue classic. It is at their glammest that's 1985 for you. Faves are Use it Or Lose it,Louder than Hell,among others. Great album."
2,Probably the weakest of the five classics.,"I recently re-purchased all the early Crue albums on disc since I originally had them on cassettes that went the way of my mullet shortly after the late eighties. Listening to this one again made me remember why it was the last one I bought over again. It's a given that the sappy-but-somehow-acceptable-for-tough-guys-to-get-into ""Home Sweet Home"" is one of their catchiest tunes, but beyond that, lots of what's on this album sounds in retrospect like they were just trying to squeeze out material to keep out of debt with the drug dealers back in the day. Too Fast for Love, Shout at the Devil, Girls Girls Girls, and Dr. Feelgood are albums that each had distinctive and ever-fresh sounds to them. I wouldn't say the same for this one."
1,salesasylum has no class!!,"Yea I bought this cassette from a company, Which could care less for their customers!! And You know what? Theatre of pain, Is one of Motleys best albums!! So if Your a Motley Crue fan, Or just a ""glam metal"" fan... You should buy this!! It rocks!! One of their best songs on here, Is ""Home Sweet Home"", I however did not get a chance to hear it!! Because the reel messed up!! I blame the company who sent it!! For sending Me a defected cassette tape!! As far as Motley goes though... They deserve five stars!! Six stars if that was an option!! The product I was sent was ""damaged goods""!! Nikki is the bass guitarist for Motley Crue. And He writes a lot of the bands as well as His own songs!! And they are rockin hard songs!! If You haven't heard of the Crue... Then You must be living under a rock!! L.O.L. But, Seriously if You call Yourself a ""rocker"" than You should own this one!!"
3,what up crue fans,No this album isn't the kick ass crue as their first two albums overall I thought it was ok there are some other good songs besides home sweet home and smokin in the boys room.Then again it's not easy to follow up an album like shout at the devil.
4,"pretty good, but not great","This is the third album by Motley. They had already become arena warriors with their previous album ""Shout at the Devil"". While ""Shout"" and ""To fast for love were great"", this album finds Motley Crue slipping a bit. Their are some good songs:""Save our souls, Louder then hell, Home sweet home, but their are also plenty of filler like ""fight for your rights"" and ""Raise your hand to rock"". The punk feel and attitude of their first two albums is all but abandoned. While the songs are as catchy as ever, Motley Crue sounds slightly subdued. It's a good album, but after the first two discs Motley Crue seems like their excesses are starting to catch up to them."
3,Somethin's Not Right Here,"Although this was the album that rocketed Motley Crue up to the top of the charts in 1985, I just can't get it. Considering its two predessesors are two of the greatest albums known to man, this one should be, too. But it's not. It is MUCH lighter and pop-oriented than Shout At The Devil, and it just doesn't have that Motley Crue sound that they used before and later. And also, this is some sort of a concept album I believe, but I just acn't get the concept. One song they are singing about gambling and money, they next they are talking about the the pains of going on tour. I just don't understand much of it. City Boy Blues, Smokin' In the Boys Room and Louder Than hell are great, but a lot of it is filler. If you are just a casual fan, stay away from this one."
5,ravage 24/7,"Motley Crue is the best!I am the biggest crue fan around and this is another excellent masterpiece by the Icons of hard rock!Mick Mars shows his versatility guitar wise on this effort with Vince,Nikki,and Tommy being as solid musically as ever.You have the greatest crue ballad of all time in Home Sweet Home along with the rockin Tonight(We Need A Lover) and Keep Your Eye On The Money.The best though which makes this the complete package is Louder Than Hell that is one of the best rock songs you'll ever have the pleasure of banging your head too.Then you have a sweet power ballad of how the world is on the edge of insanity with Save Our Souls.One more that stands out is Fight For Your Rights which is an awesome rock song for standing tall to fight for your freedom.All around a solid effort from the Crue that will rock you to the bone!Motley Crue Rules!!!1"
3,Smooth,"Love how it is smooth on the skin, great shade that blends in easy, would recommend to buy it any day"
4,Great for on-the-go touch ups!,"This pencil (golden beige) is a little too dark to cover my undereye circles but I think the lighter color would work better. The consistency is awesome, very creamy & has staying power. I would love to try more of the Judith August products."
3,Jazzless ambience for mediatation,"This is practically not a jazz record, but Coltrane's take on spiritualizations of jazz means. It's a pretty hardcore meditation record with a little jazz bite (track 2's occassional jarring strums here and there, for instance), so I can't safely recommend it for even fans of her earlier, more straight-ahead work. Take the spacey ruminations of, say, ""Journey To..."", take out the saxes and semi-traditional rhythms, add soem strings and pump up the harp and you're left with this record.I think world music or ambient heads would get more out of this than the average jazz cat."
2,Ho Hum,This book much like the first in the series was predictable.I think this is the last of this series I will read.Although it did make for easy beach reading....
4,reread,Played is about FBI Agent JT who is determined to catch the theif/con man who ruined his family. Christina is working at the auction house that is selling a rare diamond. It turns p missing and they must work together to catch the criminal. A good story that keeps you guessing who the con-man is.
4,What A Great Story,"This is the first time I read any books from this author. Was I surprised! Book 1 Taken and Book 2 Played were both exciting and kept me turning the pages faster and faster. I usually can tell by the first 10 pages if I am going to like the way the author writes....I was hooked immediately at Ms. Freethy's sytle of writing. These books had a little of everything. I just bought her other two books, Silent Run and Silent Fall. So far I am enjoying them just as much. If you want a fast, exciting, can't put down book these are the ones to get. You will not be disappointed."
2,Not her greatest book,"""Played"" by Barbara FreetheyBarbara Freethey is a very good author and I have read and enjoyed several of her books. ""Played"" was not one of them. I had the feeling her heart was not in this story."
2,This book was a dud.,"I'm sorry, I can't agree with the reviewers that said this was a real page turner. It was a page turner only in the sense that I was reduced to skimming through the last fifty pages so I could be done with this boredom. This is my first Freethy novel and while I'll give her another chance, I wasn't terribly impressed with this one. It started out okay. Sounded like it might be a pretty good read from the synopsis on the back cover. There's Christina, the artsy expert and then there's J.T., the FBI agent. And then there's a missing diamond. But the excitement ended there. J.T. was a bumbling fool who couldn't seem to do anything right. Christina grated on my nerves with all her whining. The dialogue between the two seemed to repeat itself over and over and the plot seemed just a little too shallow. The whole book, really, was just a dud of a read. A little too cheesy for what the back cover promised."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK,I love all of Barbara Freethy's books! This book is both romantic and suspenseful...I didn't want to put it down.
3,Good,The first in the Series was a 5+! Sport to say this one la Kevin the drive and thrill that I had expected to continue. A let down.
5,Found it !!!!,"I'm one of these ""International-Flight""-guys and it's true ... this CD is really hard to find.It looks like her album has been rereleased by a label called Omega Records this year. I found it at http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/matiss"
3,"Clear recipes, poor indexing.","The recipes in this book are simple and easy enough to prepare. I'm dissapointed not to find any descriptions of ingredients that give hints as to which kinds of beans can be substituted for which other kinds, and along the same lines, an index of recipes by primary ingredients would be nice.Also, the emphasis on lima beans is very heavy and I find it difficult to pick out which recipes will have a strong lima bean flavor, and which will not."
5,Fantastic,"Sui Generis are one of the best groups ever to have played, I rank them up there with Bobs Dylan and Marley for mastery of their art. This collection is simply sublime for fans of folksy, bluesy, honest, knowing music."
4,SCARY AS @#$%!,"It is a rare thing to find a book that will literally keep me awake at night. CUQUI is just such a book. The only real disappointment is that the author is not really a ""horror"" writer. In fact, this is his only ""horror"" novel."
2,"Like it, but.............","Glad it came quickly, but when it got here it was ALOT smaller than I thought it would be. The book is an inch taller than a CD case and about half as wide. This book could easily fit in a large pocket. Personally, I don't think it was worth the price, if I had known it was this small, I would have just got the big one. If you are a pocket-sized book person this is the book for you, if not, I suggest getting the big version."
4,"Big, but works","This brush was larger than I expected since I didn't see the measurements listed by the seller. It is about 8 inches long. It works really well, but it won't fit in a purse like I had hoped. The handle is white plastic, not metal like it looked (to me) in the photo. Works just about as well as the rollers with sticky paper on them, which saves me money! Overall, it's a good item."
2,the few tips I learned,"don't put yourself down in anyway No girl has ever dumped you Dating history must be kept history You can get a date anytime you want Do not talk about other girls at all All girls like you Everyone looks good with a sun tan Always smile Carry mints, pen,paper, business cards, chapstick."
1,Stay away from this book,"I only read little of the this book while at a bookstore. But, I read some advice that is completely wrong. So, I would not trust any advice this book gives.The author instructs guys to not dance with a woman they are interested in if possible. I know with experience that this advice is wrong."
2,Worthless,"This book is, overall, worthless. It has some humor in it and some really basic knowledge (dress in clothes that fit you, exercise, eat well, etc.), but when it comes down to the basic approach of meeting women, it's incredibly vague. They call your pitch to a girl a ""rap,"" and they divide the rap into three categories: beginning, middle, and end. The beginning is where you introduce yourself, the middle is where you build rapport and interest, and the end is where you close the deal with her number. These three sections are the most important parts of meeting women, yet they glaze over them in about 5 pages of text. Also this book recommends buying women drinks: this is a no-no, unless she buys you one and you buy her one. Supplicating a woman will not help your game.In short, this book can be summed up in about a page of bulleted points. There are plenty of other books on the subject that are better and more worth your time.Don't buy this book: it's worthless."
1,Bunch of common sense,"This book is worthless. Just a bunch of common sense. Very badly written and with not much practical advice or practical examples.Spends all the time talking about how important it is to have a ""master rap"" and almost no time explaining how to get one. The word ""rap"" becomes quite annoying after a while... it must be repeated a million times. Save your money."
2,could be better,"Just finished reading it and was not that impressed. Some techniques seem feasible, but others are just plain simple. Nothing new here. It is good for guys who have never had any contact with women, but not for me, an average frat boy with intergender skills, wanting to get lots more. I much rather recommend Milf-Seduction.com or Advanced Macking... which had more nitty-gritty useable stuff..."
1,Very inaccurate,"One of the most inaccurate books on the subject that I've ever encountered. Your chances of successfully meeting a girl using techniques from this book are slim to none. Keep looking, this isn't the book you want."
5,"A ""GUIDE"" FOR GIRLS TOO!!!","Curiosity made me purchase ""The Guide To Picking Up Girls""...I had seen the author on Naked New York and I had heard part of his interview with Howard Stern. This Fischbarg character is one confident chap. His book, I am surprised to admit is not only a delightful hoot, it's chock full of interesting insights into the way women operate. It's clear the author did his due diligence in researching his chosen topic. I found myself laughing out loud during some chapters and nodding along at others. If you want some useful, intelligent, and amusing perspective on the different ways men and women interact socially, this book is invaluable. The commercials on the book's website www.pickingupgirls.com are not to be missed either."
4,"Simple Clean Design, Easy to Install .... BUT The Bulb (not included) cost me more than the fixture","Very basic simple design. Good enough product and easy to install. The only issue was the price of the bulb being more than the fixture itself (I got it on sale).Otherwise, it's as good as it looks and is described for a basic fixture."
1,A Student Who Uses This Book In Antigua,"This book was awful. In my 8th grade class all the kids were wondering, where is the plot, where is the use of literary skill. I happen to come from the island of Antigua and I think this book was a disgrace on the writers behalf."
1,Horribly uninteresting and unclimatic.,"This could just very well be the worse novel in existance. There is no clear beginning, middle or end, but rather the story feels bland and the character developement is vague in almost every aspect. The narrator comes out of the book as selfish and a whinner and at times she seemed unsure of her sexuality. Nothing in the story is explained well enough to actually call this a story. It's as if a person grouped a bunch of words together in hopes that something good would come of it, but sadly the only thing good about this novel was after I set it down, because I wouldn't have to bear looking at it any longer."
1,Burn it!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"It was torture for me to read this book and then have to discuss it. Of course, the only point of interest was whether or not Annie was a lesbian!To sum up, life sucks, her mother has abandoned her since their relationship has evolved since she became a young adult (why can't we take baths like we used to!!!), life sucks, girls gone wild scene, and life sucks!"
1,Yawn...snore...zzz....,"This book was sooooooo boring. I kept reading it only in the misguided hope that it would get more interesting. It has an unlikeable and annoying main character. The writing style is overly simple, and literally NOTHING happens. The reason that she and her mother ""fall out"" is never explained. Don't waste your time."
4,Good,"The text of this book it poetic and somewhat hard to read. I am reading this novel in a World Literature class. Jamacia Kincaid is great, yet the poetic form seems to be confusing."
3,It's more complex than all that,"I'm actually teaching this book to a group of rising ninth graders. I can see that they are sometimes frustrated with the subtlety of Kincaid's writing and the fact that sometimes big, huge events seem to come out of nowhere. Reading closely, however, I really appreciate the complexity of the book and the depth of the texture. It is not a perfect book, but, with enough effort on the part of the reader, can be very insightful about the process of asserting one's independence as a person. I think adults might appreciate this more than kids being forced to read it - don't be fooled by the apparant simplicity of Kincaid's work, and take it slow."
2,Typical Ninth Grade Required Reading Tripe,"I really can't recommend this book. I have *never* been so annoyed with the slow pace, lack of plot, unmeaningful imagery, and symbols that makes William Golding's ""Lord of the Flies"" look good. I think those that shared the experience of being forced to read this book from my highschool will all look back at this in fear."
3,well done,"Annie John was a well written book, about a young girl who after being sheltered by her parents, suddenly becomes somewhat disconnected from them. It seems that as she enters puberty her relationship with her mother deteriorates. I believe that this is the fault of the mother who did things with her daughter that made her too attached, for example they often took baths together. When Annie's mother realises that she is becoming a woman she begins to treat her different and Annie feels as though she is alone in her own world without the love that she feared losing throughout her childhood. This causes her to develop a deep hatred for her mother whom she once loved so much. I cannot say that I relate to Annie however Jamaica Kincaid does such a wonderful job getting you actually feel the pain and happiness encountered ny the character."
5,I loved reading this book,"I wanted to read some of Kincaid's fiction, and i most say Annie John was great. I love the humor in her books, and how the characthers seem to come alive. Annie John is about the relationship between her and her mother. It makes one think of there own relationship with there mother."
4,I can definitely relate!,"I thought Annie John was wonderful! I am a young woman, early twenties, and I could definitely relate to Annie's experiences. Annie's progression throughout the book was wonderful, yet unfortunately not all young girls have such a pleasant result. In fact, I think this is a ""must read"" for college-aged students (not high school.. they may fail to fully understand its significance). My only question: who is the girl on the cover.. or is it a piece of art that was favored by the author? I certainly don't think it's Annie based on her descriptions."
1,TERRIBLE,"I truly hated Annie John, the writing was too bland and I hope the book was not an autobiography like some say since Annie was pretty screwed up. For instance, Annie loves to go to funerals of people she does not know just to stare at the dead people. She also wants to tap the hump of a dead hunchback girl. Also, 90% of the book is just Annie griping about how much she hates her mother."
3,Where The Motherly Instinct Comes From,"Kincaid does a great job of expressing a young girls jouney into her women hood. The book also talks a lot about how Annie John recieves all of her independece and motherly instinct. Kincaid tells the story of Annie John in such a way you could almost think that it is kincaid herself telling her childhood stories. The character is strong, determined and is a very intellegent women. Kincaid does a fantastic job of showing how a daughter is just like her mother while she grows up and when she grows up. These elements along with the ease at which this story can be read makes it great for all ages to read. The story also lets you analyze the many themes and magic that the carribean island posses."
5,Coming of Age in the Caribbean,What a wonderful tale Annie John is! I read this book my Freshman year in college--it was a required reading for an introductory anthropoligical course on the Caribbean. I was so delighted to find out that Amazon included this novella on their list!
5,A moving story,"I consider Annie as one of or perhaps Kincaid's best written novels. It successfully and succinctly describes the unsettling feelings of a young girl growing up into adulthood, who having lived a life sheltered by her parents, must find a path by herself because her parents could not relate to the transition in her life, a transition that is different from the life her parents were used to. This book brilliantly explored the relationship between a mother and her rapidly maturing daughter and will serve as a helpful story to mothers and daughters the world over. This is one enjoyable , emotional and truthful story you will cherish. The usurper and Other Stories, Disciples of Fortune, A Small place are books that richly explored the theme."
4,Did Not Disappoint Me!!,"Once again, Jamaica Kincaid's book did not disappoint me. She writes mainly in narration, but you can follow along easily, and especially since I came from the carribean I get exactly what she is saying."
2,Annie John - A Review From a Student at a Catholic School,"Annie John was one of my summer reading books at my catholic high school. The other two were Anne Frank and House on Mango Street. I found this book to have a very interesting setting. Most of the character's live's almost totally revolve around superstition. The main character Annie, seems to be superstitous about her mother's hands which us readers learn at the begining of the book. Annie deals with her own immoral problems, and tries to ""figure herself out"" Most of it was interesting, and I liked the stories Annie described with her mother. Because of all of the immoral things the writer places in the book, I can't really recommend this it, but if your interested in Antigua it is quite informative."
1,"Annie John, one of my school reading books",Annie John was one of the worst and most twisted books I've ever read in my life. It's basically a story about a Gay girl in Antigua. Who realizes she is different. Unfortunately she doesn't stop her wrong doings.
2,Just an OK book,"I had to read this book for my English class. I found the book an easy read, but at times I could not understand the motivation of the main character. Yes, the book was colorful, but I cannot understand why it was named one of the best books of 1985."
3,Very Interesting,"Despite what many other people may think, my friends, and other people around my age, may not appreciate this book. Sure, it seems like an odd and boring book, but maybe thats because some of the symbolism and situations that occur in it might not appeal to other readers. I actually thought it was very interesting. This book was required for summer reading and out of the books, Anne Frank and The House on Mango Street, i found this one most enjoyable. Annie finds herself growing up too fast because of her excellent learning ability. She is a bright girl with lots of potential. She begins her life admiring and adoring her mother, when , as she grows up, she becomes more matureand views the world in a whole other way and progresses a hate relationship with her mother. I honestly thought this book was worth my time reading, and also taking in consideration that its a kinda thin book to read. :)"
5,Authentic,"Having come from the island where 'Annie John' lived, I must admit that I was extremely pleased with what I read. Ms. Kincaid recalled places and events with such accuracy that I actually felt that I was back home, and as i remembered them all, I read much faster and with more understanding of what 'Annie John' felt as a young girl, passing from childhood to womanhood. I have yet to read the other books penned by Ms. Kincaid, but this one I enjoyed thoroughly."
3,A little slow at parts,This book was good in parts and slow in other parts; overall it was ok. I liked the style of Kincaid's writing and how she described the setting. She was able to make you feel like you were really there. But the book got slow in parts. There were not enough events in the girl's life to keep me interested. I think the book should have been condensed. This would have made it more interesting. I think this book is best for early to middle teens because the language is not too difficult and the book focuses on that point of her life.
2,Misleadiing images and reviews,"I found this on a search and with the reviews, the customer images and the price I thought, ""Wow, the original Greatest Hits albumn."" So I jumped on the order. Then I started listening to the clips. Something was not guite right. So I did a search and found the actual orgianl greatest hits ablum availabel for $9.99. And as memory served they sounded different. This is apparently a remakes of the original songs.For the price it was worth getting this but had I taken the time to compare and not trusted the comments and images I would have likely passed this by for the real original greatest hits.If you want a good representation of Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels I would recommend you do the same."
5,creepy pretty music,"this is an absolutely amazing album.... the beats are solid, and the music is driving, kind of eerie sometimes, but always beautiful... rogue and rachel are amazing violinists and rogue's voice fits in almost frighteningly well with the rom-style violins. great stuff."
1,Wrong,I just got in the mail today and it is totally wrong. My weigh was 223 three days ago and today I'm 238 it is wring and then it went to 235... I'm returning mine. I think nobody should Buy this
2,Stopped Working,I purchased this scale as a gift for my sister and it stopped working within three weeks. It says on the box that it has a lifetime lithium battery...but she was going to try and replace the battery to see if she could get it to work again. Very disappointed...
4,Great for the price,My wife joined Weight Watchers and has lost over 12 lbs in three months. The scale is accurate and matches her weight at the meetings. I like the BF and H2O readings as well. I have a tendency to get dehydrated and this keeps it in check.
5,Weight Watchers Want it,This is totally cool. You put in your height and age and it tells you your BMI and water percentage not to mention your weight. I love it because it helps me to determine if I am drinking enough water thru the day.
3,To Weigh or not to weigh that is the question,"I found this scale to be very attractive and worth it's price to be an aide to help me lose a few pounds that I have gained. I do though only give it an okay due to it's not easy instructions how to use the body fat and body water. It is quite complex and I have had mixed results attempting to use it for the body fat and Body water. It is though a very attractive scale that is flat which really is good in small spaces, such as my bathroom. I found the price to be reasonable as well."
4,Heavy Topic,"Scale works fine, has more features than I wanted, but seems to be fairly accurate. I wish it weighed 10 pounds less!"
2,Accuracy Should Come before Price,"Wanting to better track my health, I reviewed all of the scales on amazon and then purchased this model, which offered as many features as the more expensive models, but at half the price. Aware of the ""cheapie"" history of the brand, I had my doubts about the quality of the product, however, and I now regret my purchase. This scale is highly inaccurate and unreliable. The other night, I weighed myself five times in a row, receiving different measurements each time, including a total range of five pounds difference and 2% body fat difference, both of which are significant to anyone serious about losing weight and lowering body fat. I now realize that accuracy should be the primary consideration when purchasing a scale. I will probably give this scale away, and purchase one of the more expensive, better reviewed models here on amazon."
2,"Inconsistent readings, Body Fat reading does not always work","Weight Watcher Scale By Conair WW31 Digital Body Fat and Body Water ScaleThis scale is pretty good if you just want to read your weight. My husband got inconsistant readings on hydration and body fat. My daughter and myself got an ""Err"" reading for body fat and hydration and I don't think it matters what weight you are . My daughter is very thin and still readings would not work. Waste of money if you are looking for those other features to work."
3,What do I really weigh?!,"I purchased this scale to keep track of my weight loss. I'm not overweight but want to lose and tone up to be healthier and get back in shape. I also joined Weight Watchers for the nutrition part, since portion control and keeping track of what I eat helps me a lot. This scale isn't all that accurate and there is almost a 5 pound difference between this scale and the scale at my Weight Watchers meetings. Also, I had weighed myself at different times during the day (out of curiosity) and found that the difference in numbers seem unrealistic. I am considering talking to a doctor to find out if it's normal for that much of a weight fluctuation throughout one day. I bought this scale for accuracy and now question it. I am probably going to wind up spending the extra money and getting a better scale."
2,Might have been fine but mine wouldn't even power up,"This seems like a neat scale for the price, but mine would not even turn on. Had to return it and I just stopped at Walmart and bought a nice Taylor model."
3,"Thin on Plot, But Strong on Momentum","Robert C. Wilson's ICEFIRE isn't exactly an adrenaline rush of a thriller. Wilson is big on texture and atmosphere, so the novel is a bit dense and groggy in its plot points, while the characters remain nothing more than 2-dimensional creations. Still, the desolate, snowbound settings are different, and some nice twists and turns keep it trudging along adequately. Not really all that good, yet it has some original moments that earn it some heft."
5,Awesome toy for my contruction-aholic 3 year old!,"I bought this for my 2.5 year old son as a potty training reward. He saw it sitting on the refridgerator and immediately needed to use the potty. He loves this and still plays with it quite a lot! If your son (or daughter) is in to construction vehicles, then it's a great buy!"
4,Fun but comes apart easily,"I didn't expect it to come apart so easily, and I'm constantly having to help my toddler reaffix the digging arm, but he really likes it and uses it to help dig in the garden, and we use it to dig gravel too. So although I was disappointed upon receiving it, it seems to be a hit overall."
5,Works as advertised.,"I suffer from unusually cold hands. I first tried a heated mouse, which was great. But I found my non-mouse hand was still very cold. This product fixed that. Also you can easily turn it off when the weather changes, and you don't need the heat anymore. This product works exactly as advertised. Highly recommended."
3,Worth it for the bonus tracks,"First, ""I Don't Need No Doctor"" is not ""Humble Pie-penned."" It's an Ashford and Simpson song first recored by Ray Charles in 1966. Humble Pie didn't record it until two years after the Watchband.As noted, this is CWB's weakest effort, but the original (very short!) album is improved vastly by the four bonus tracks on this reiusse...in particular the two from the ""Riot on Sunset Strip"" soundtrack.Even though both are basically thefts (or charitably, rewrites: ""Sitting There Standing"" = ""The Nazz Are Blue"" = ""Dust My Broom""; ""Don't Need Your Lovin'"" = ""Milk Cow Blues"") -- the execution is quintessential 60s garage punk. The very definition of the genre, really.Whether the stuff spread across their three albums is even the band itself or anonymous studio cats (the psychedelic stuff), CWB remain a 60s treasure."
3,Chocolate Watchband - 'One Step Beyond' (Sundazed),"Originally released in 1969 as the band's third and final effort.Missing is vocalist David Aguiler,not exactly sure as to who's the singer on 'One Step...',but it's a decent album.Not as good as 'Inner Mystique'(see my review)but okay.Some of the better tracks here are ""Uncle Morris"",your standard garage rocker ""How Ya Been"",the Humble Pie penned ""I Don't Need No Doctor"",""And She's Lonely"" and ""Don't Need Your Lovin'"".Remember,they ALL can't be classics."
2,Seasoning's better then the food,"2 1/2Apparently the worst of this band's brief classic rock haze, the dated material, often impressive in only technical aspects of minor increments where the majority of the non balls up rockers are concerned, stagnates with a lack of direction in songwriting aided by misguided vocals. Still, if appreciated in small sections, with regards to date of release, there are often enough impressive fills, licks, whatnot to gaze at while the overall song may be going nowhere, or in a generically rock-a-blue's (albeit with a nice bite) way."
1,Watch out,"Unfortunately Intro to MFC Prog with Visual C++ by R Jones is written for a previous version of Visual C++. Since I have Visual C++.NET 2003, I couldn't get beyond page 2. Neither the book nor the authors web site tells you what version is required."
3,"Not the best, but not too shabby","MFC programming is a bear, especially in VC++ 6.0 (not .NET). This book does a decent job of introducing key concepts, and comes with a mountain of sample code on CD. If MFC/VC++ were my first programming language, I would look for a book geared more towards total complete novices; otherwise, it does the trick."
3,Too simple,"The book is extremely basic, consistently using code that is generated from the VC wizards. It is not overtly useful if you are trying to do anything complicated or have any decent MFC experience.If you know NOTHING, then this book may be an appropriate starter."
4,Good book for MFC introduction...,"I bought this book to find out how to use MFC in Visual Studio. I already know C++, so I only needed to have a guide for MFC. This book starts with creating a MFC program from scratch. Then it goes into using Visual Studio's project creator. I found learning how MFC works under the hood also helped to know what the projet creator had made for me. Doing simple windows programs are easier than ever now."
5,Enviable Control of Melodic and Harmonic Tension,"L'Ensemble Arion, a period-instrument group, performs three quartets from ""Nouveaux Quatuors en 6 Suites"" (Paris, 1738) by Georg Philipp Telemann (1681-1767).""Arion's enviable control of melodic and harmonic tension comes from tempos that never allow the texture to become clogged, and a way of dovetailing rather than splicing phrases together to create seamless but always musically-driven momentum."" (Winnipeg Free Press)The works on this recording:1. Quartet No. 4 in B minor for flute, violin, cello and bc, TWV 43:b22. Quartet No. 5 in A major for flute, violin, cello and bc, TWV 43:A33. Quartet No. 6 in E minor for flute, violin, cello and bc, TWV 43:e4"
3,Ok,Not bad but just OK. Carrie's one-woman show Wishful Drinking is a much more entertaining way to catch their story.
3,"Go home, little boy!","The Crossfires were an early incarnation of the Turtles, back when they were a surf group. A little over half the CD is surf instrumentals, with ""Silver Bullet"" and ""Fiberglass Jungle"" being great, and the rest being average. There are also some songs with lyrics, most of which aren't that impressive, with the most interesting being ""One Potato Two Potato"", which sounds like an early precursor to bubblegum music. There are even two Christmas songs, including the hilarious ""Santa and the Sidewalk Surfer"". This CD will probably only be of interest to surf music fans or Turtles fans (I am both)."
2,Text only,I bought this calendar because of the great picture on the box. I was deeply disappointed to find that the actual calendar has no such images--just a one-line text statement every day. I won't buy another one from Jeff.
4,Slightly Disappointed.,"The calendar is funny, but not as funny as last year's. Seems like their running out of material."
5,A daily treat,"Every day after work, I rip off a new page and enjoy my 10-seconds of fun!! I have been buying this calendar for years now. It's even funnier when you think to yourself, ""Oh, my. I think I might be a redneck!"" Sometimes I take the joke of the day and give it to someone who I think will enjoy it or who fits the bill."
4,the great Erroll Garner,"A comprehensive look at the work of Erroll Garner. This is soulful, contemplative playing by a sensitive pianist. The reviewer who knocks it because it's missing one song is being unfair toward the total body of work which has so many fine songs."
1,"lack the most essential Error Garner song: ""Misty"".","I have not actually bought, or listened to this disc, as it lacks (as stated in the title to this review) the most essential title in Mr. Garner's song collection: ""Misty"". I know the song can be found on other discs, but if this is an overview, lacking this song, is a poor one. Better to get some ""essential"" collection by this artist."
4,pretty good movie adaptation of the intriguing opera,"interesting version of the great bartok opera. the two performers sing well, although the stylized acting of opera works less well on screen and the scenery is a little ridiculous at times because it's so unrealistic. the singer who plays bluebeard is a little too stoic at the end. the last scene is extremely well-done dramatically and visually -- the costumes are amazing. worth seeing this fascinating highly allegorical opera visually, although the production doesn't do very well resolving the difficulties of the staging because it tries to depict the scenes too literally."
3,Good story,"I read this book because I knew nothing about the mid-eighteenth century in Europe, and I found the story to fascinating. I could have done with some decent maps. Those in the book could have been sketched by a four-year-old. No legends. Few labels. Forget trying to put them in any spacial context with the continent. Locating a town, river or natural feature that is central to the story is successful maybe 20% of the time.The author's style, pompous and condescending, really got on my nerves. The hit rate for his attempts at irony and humor is also in the 20% range. I don't mind not knowing details, names, historical facts that he alludes to, as I said, I knew nothing when I picked up the book. He seems to be intentionally unhelpful, keeping the reader off balance as his narrative meanders. Characters and places appear suddenly with no introduction. If he were my instructor, I would be wary of trick questions on the exam."
3,Yard spots,"After using this form 30 days, had to go back to original product d/t causing chemical imbalance in the urine. This caused the urine to kill off my grass. Know this was the cause because before using and after going back to what I first used the spots were not there."
5,An incredible book,"This book gives a pilots' account into the ME-163 Komet - one of the most incredible aircraft ever built. This is not a war story in essence, but a story of the pilots who befriended one another through one of history's darkest chapters. You'll have a hard time putting it down. It's a story of a plane that was 10 years ahead of its time, built by a genius named Dr. Alexander Lippisch. It didn't make a difference in the war but remains one of the most amazing and unique airplanes of all time."
5,SMILE,to sum up paul rudermans album WISH in one word SMILE. his album is defently my number one album of the year. And soon will be my number one album of all time. It just puts a big SMILE on your face and to think in this day and age someone wrighting there own songs and playing there own instruments. paul will defently go places and one day become a legend. Its the real musicans that get left unnoticed but as long as paul change's one persons life for the better or worse then you know he did ok.
5,Attitude adjuster,Tis book definately should be a required read for fire officers. There is a lot of pertinent information for the future or existing officer.
3,Not as described,"This unit was more powerful than I anticipated. I chose it because the description said that it had both the UV light and bio filter with the back flush nob. Unfortunately you have to take the top off to get to the nob, not what I expected nor easy to get to. Therefore, I sent it back."
5,don't miss this one,"I've waited so long for quality issues of these titles, and I'm not disappointed. After years of bootlegged fifth-generation prints, we finally have what look like brand-new anamorphic copies. And the films are delightful (I'm essentially referring to crab monsters & not of this earth), perfect representations of low-budget fifties sci-fi. (Crab Monsters was the highest grossing low-budget production of 1957) Now all we need are similar editions of THE UNDEAD & IT CONQUERED THE WORLD. (I have to admit to relishing my old AMC full-screen edition of THE UNDEAD, as it gives full justice to statuesque Alision Hayes, but quality will out, and I'd rather see an ultra-clean, ultra-sharp anamorphic copy like these two) I haven't watched War of the Satellites, and it's a 4:3 transfer. My interest isn't that great, but I'm bound to catch it eventually."
4,Long Last Love,"I remember seeing these movies, just like everyone else watching thriller at 11:00 pmSaturday night. But,what I remember most was talking about them the next day. We adored these little films and would stop at nothing to watch them. Yes, we are talking about all of these films from ""Not Of This Earth"" to Attack of the 50 foot women"" to even the Killer Shrews.It is also a joy to see these films uncut and in pristine shape, thank you Shout Dvd for this professional job. Thousand of dollars have been spent on bootleg copies to poor transfers of all of these films and now justice has been done. Great Job! There are still a large library of films to be corrected and copied from the original negatives and put on DVD for the fans to enjoy. Roger Corman is the Master of the genre and these little films of excellence is what we have been waiting for. Thank YouWalter Goodseal Jr. The Movie Protector"
5,Great picture,I had 2 DVDs that I bought previously (Attack Of The Crab Monsters & Not Of This Earth)from other websites. The picture quality of both discs were not that good. AOTCM I would give a 4 out of 10 and NOTE would get a 6. ShoutFactory's copies would recieve a 10. The pictures were crisp and clear and looked like the source material rather than a copy. I hope that older black and white films would receive this kind of treatment and I look forward to more from ShoutFactory.
3,When you have seen all the good ones.,Well was not the greatest Sci-Fi movies but not too bad. Worth watching if you don't expect a lot fromthe movies.
5,Great cult classics,"This is a must have for fans of Roger Corman. The movies are some of the earliest and were done on nickle budgets.All 3 films come with good commentary and extras. My favorite is Attack of the Crab Monsters. This movie is a lot of fun and is a great rainy day film.All of the movies are worth the price of DVD and with the extras, this is a true B horror fans delight."
4,Cult films available at last on DVD,"These three Corman films from the fifties are now available in great condition on DVD. ""War of the Satellites"" has never been available until now. All three are cult classics of low-budget B filmmaking. Also included is a documentary/tribute to Corman and previews of many of his films ( some not yet available). A great buy!"
4,The Glass is Half Full!,"First of all, let me say I'm thrilled to see these titles finally available. I, for one, am glad that these films aren't being released in the putrid DVD-R on demand format: we should all stand aginst that trend by refusing to buy them!! I'm very surprised that no reviewer has mentioned that this 2 DVD set has 1 serious flaw: there are no chapter divisions or time readouts on any of the 3 films! Plus when the film ends, the only way to return the blank screen in the STOP mode is to press PLAY and then STOP. It may seem to some that this no big deal and not worth complaining about, but hey, they had one shot and they didn't get it completely right! Also,while the prints on all 3 films are very good, I seriously doubt they were struck from negatives.Periodically there is quite a bit of speckling especially in WAR OF THE SATELLITES. If all of the above extras(?) come down to cost, I wouldn't mind paying more for an ultimately better product."
3,One out of three ani't bad.,Attack of the crabs was great and the kids were engrossed the whole time. The other two took there time to get good. By then the kids and myself sort of lost interest by the half way point.
4,Roger Corman and his movies,"The DVD provides so insight into the mind of Roger Corman, whether that's a good thing or not is for you to decide. The three movies are good examples of the 50's interesting and entertaining SciFi movie."
2,Roger Corman's Cult Classics Triple Feature,"I Swear to God this is the WORST 3 movies I have EVER seen. Roger Corman has done some good stuff before, but this is SO BENEATH him I could cry. NOt that he's such a wizard, but this is not even C class, two fo them. Best is War of Satellites, but this STUPID NOt of This Earth, a 3-year old CHILD could write better than that! D MOVIES. Only one that's a C is Satellites. That Charles B. Griffith (Bucket of Blood which ALSO was no good!), ought to go back to KINDERGARTEN! Not of this Earth also not edited very well. Supposed to assume or know stuff that evidently has been cut out. Crab Monsters a D also. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, folks. I will never buy a Corman/Griffith movie AGAIN! NEVER! I keep trying to rate this movie a One Star, but it will not show the stars even. Something wrong w/site.Cecyl Ivie"
3,Terrible Sound Quality,"Nice prints of these classic Corman films but the sound quality for ""Crab Monsters"" is difficult to sit through. Very poor quality in the sound department yet the other two films are okay. Nice packaging and they were good enough to include all 3 films on two discs so you don't have the usual cheap two-sided single DVD. The irritating 'scratchy sound' on the one film keeps this ""Triple Feature"" collection out of the 5 star category in my opinion."
2,Hahahahha,Roger Cormon stands behind Ed Wood as one of the true Creatins of crappola. These jokes of movies will have you laughing on the floor. And the fact that they were serious makes it even better.
5,Roger Corman Triple Feature,Finally a release of the cult classic Not Of This Earth and a decent copy of Attack of the Crab Monsters. This is a two disc set with nice extras including interesting commentaries on Attack of the Crab Monsters and Not Of This Earth. The prints on all 3 movies are excellent. A real treat for 1950's scifi/horror fans. A 5-Star release!!!
5,****** EXCELLENT QUALITY PRINTS ******,"I MUST SHOUT ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THESE 3 RARE MOVIES,I ALMOST GAVE UP AFTER OVER 20 YEARS OF HUNTING,***** ""NOT OF THIS EARTH"" IS WORTH THE PRICE ALONE!,*****THIS MOVIE STILL GIVES ME THE CREEPS,""CRAB MONSTERS"" IS THE NEXT BEST, *****SOMEONE AT ""SHOUTFACTORY""REALLY,REALLY,REALLY KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE DOING,***** BOTH MOVIES ARE ANAMORPHIC, FILLING THE WHOLE RECTANGULAR SCREEN WITH NO DISTORTION! ***THANK YOU!, **** THANK YOU AGAIN!."
1,Definitely not a $40 Bridal Shower gift!,"The stuff comes in a white cardboard box with cardboard handles that were squooshed and crumpled. The 2 DVDs are packaged as 1, and the cover makes it look like grainy black and white porn. The Music CD looks nice, the massage oil looks kind of silly and juvenile, but OK. The 3 little votive candles look cheesey and I really don't know what the 3 tiny baggies of crunchy stuff are -- bath stuff?"
2,What's This [stuff]?!,"Don't get me wrong, I love The Crue, but this is garbage. Just about everything on here is on another Crue cd, and if it's not, it's because it [stinks].The only reason to buy this cd would be to get Primal Scream, and that's only if you can't find Greatest Hits or Decade.But really, who actually bought this cd?"
3,Beware-Plastic button-Not Aluminum,"Item arrived on time but didn't mention that the push button was plastic. Discribed as Screen and Storm Door Pushbutton Latch, Aluminum"
4,Very atmosphetic,"This really covers what I like about Chicago indie horror. Very moody and atmospheric, while aware that the structures and confines of Chicago provide their own sense of horror. The actor playing pickman rides the edge between frustration and madness very well. This keeps the tradition of leaving the nightmares unseen and misunderstood fare past even the end. Maurice is, as always, a fun addition to a show, and although there were gaps in pacing, it was a worthwhile purchase."
4,overall good effort,Well shot independent feature. Very respectful of the source material. Definitely establishes a dystopian mood.
5,Well directed and actors were great!,I was very impressed by this independent movie. It's obvious that they did more than well with this. The acting is wonderful and the cinemetography is very intriguing and shows a brilliant artisitc eye on the part of the director. Great for anyone who likes thrillers!
2,Meh....,"This flick is a 20 minute Night Gallery segment stretched out to a full-length film. Not a bad story, but really couldn't and shouldn't fill 75 minutes. Skip it unless you find a copy really cheap."
3,went to far,the attempt to merge the two stories failed. i would have loved to see haunter of the dark done on its own. as pickmans model was. with the special effects done now some of lovecrafts stories would be fantastic
2,It needed some work!,"""Pickman's model"" is one of my favorite HP Lovecraft stories. This movie does capture the elements but I was disappointed with the delivery.This story is based on two of the author's stories ""Pickman's model and the Haunter of the Dark.""The use of the neighborhood children to give the background of the church when the doctor investigated one of his patients seemed out of place in the story. I got the impression the director hired the local children nearby so the scene was amateurish.In the original story, HP Lovecraft describes the painting the artist drew in detail, yes the people's reaction in the movie conveyed the idea that what he had painted was horrifying but you never got to see the painting. And I wanted to see it.I would skip this one."
1,overhyped,this is a badly photographed pretentious turkey. I bought this dvd based on the reviews which describes a different movie than what I watched.
1,Pickman's Boring,"I bought this movie based on the reviews but this is one of the most boring movies that i've seen in my life... Bad acting, bad directed, very amateurish photography and go on..."
4,A Very Good Debut Novel!,"In Hostile Witness, William Lashner's debut legal thriller, the author rises to the top of writers in this genre. In Victor Carl, he has create a very believable, very real and very flawed hero. What makes this book worth reading is Lashner's strength in character development. Further, the plot is also very clever and interesting --although, for me, it is stretched out somewaht longer than I felt it needed to be. At times, I found myself skimming through sections about the 'characters' in order to get back to the 'heart of the story'. As a result, unlike most reviewers who gave this book a five star rating, I'd rate it worthy of four stars -- a very good, but not outstanding rating. I think if this book was 100 or so pages less, I would have enjoyed it a lot more and probably rated it five stars. Despite this criticism, Hostile Witness is a worthwhile read. I'm looking forward to reading Lashner's other books featuring Victor Carl (Veritas, Fatal Flaw and Past Due)."
5,HERE'S A MYSTERY NOVEL WITH A SATISFYING FINALE,"This is one of the best legal thrillers I've read - including Grisham, Turrow, R.N. Patterson. Protagonist Victor Carl is so human - flaws and all - I found his character as complelling as the mystery itself. Don't read any synopsis of this book! Get to know the characters and the story one page at a time.I devoured the book during a recent vacation - and on the 6 hour plane trip home. Couldn't wait to check for additional titles by the author and was glad to learn that Carl's not-so-illustrious legal career continues in Lashner's next novel."
4,Better than Grisham,"This author deserves a wide audience. If you like Grisham or Turow or the other legal fiction writers of recent times, try this one. The plot is twisty and turny, but best of all, you have a hero who is different and struggling with interior demons. I look forward to the sequel"
3,Hostile Witness,"Long and boring. This is not the type of book that I would select for my pleasure reading and I don't know why my book club picked it. If I hadn't wanted to finish this for book club, I would have taken it back to the library way before the end. The characters were not ones that I could embrace, and the story, while very well-written, was rather uninteresting to me. Courtroom drama, violence, sex - blah."
5,Riveting,"Wow, this guy can write! I thoroughly enjoyed this Philly-based mystery full of as many interesting characters are you can ever find walking around the city. Laughs, great perceptions, surprising twists, and depth. This book has it all!"
3,The London Sessions,"This was Nancy Sinatra's third album. Instead of recording in Los Angeles as she previously did, she traveled to London to make this album. That proved to be a mistake. Instead of recording with hip young Los Angeles session musicians, she recorded with middle aged (or older) orchestral musicians. Of course, these older gentlemen were talented musicians, but their style was wrong for Nancy. There were some good songs recorded at these sessions, but they are relatively ""lifeless"" when compared to her other recordings. I'm probably not the only person who feels that way, because this was the worst selling album Nancy recorded for Reprise Records. The CD contains four bonus tracks, which are all non-LP singles."
5,The new edition is fantastic 2004,"The Chapters on Pancreas, esophagus, gastric surgery (peptic ulcer, and gastric cancer), melanoma, and trauma, are all marvellous, i haven.t read the others. I find it better than the previous edition. It's the best book on surgery (not operative surgery), allthough i haven't yet looked at the new edition of Schwartz, that is coming in 2005."
5,Read it all!,"This book is a must. The best out there. Don't rely on screen books. For somethings, you just must have a reference book, and this is the one to get."
4,Beginner's Guide to Brake System,"This is the book if you want to find out the general idea of brake systems in cars. The book covers general idea of brake without going into detail. If you have no knowledge about brakes, this should help you to jump on the braking area."
1,Worst Item to Order Ever!,"I have to tell you when I ordered this item -- there was a drop down selection to choose which character you wanted and I chose the dog for a care package to send a friend. I needed it in a hurry so I paid for overnight delivery. When I received my package - it was NOT the dog -- it was a turtle. I contacted customer service who apologized and GUARANTEED they would overnight the dog -- I got the new package today, AGAIN NOT THE DOG -- this time a frog. Since my order, they have taken away the drop down selection and now indicate the item you receive will vary. HORRIBLE WAY TO TREAT A CUSTOMER! EXTREMELY NOT SATISFIED."
1,May not work,"The laugh button in the foot did not work. I cannot recommend this item. Be prepared to return it. Item is below the standard Amazon quality, in my experience."
3,Handy but small,This is a really nice plant waterer and seems to be constructed well. It is quite small though and so when watering my house plants I have to refill it quite a few times. The long spout makes it easy to reach the middle of the planter or higher plants.
4,Stainless Steel and Attractive,"This watering can is, without a doubt, the most reasonably priced, QUALITY watering can Amazon.com offers for sale at this time. It's well built and nicely designed, attractive and easy to keep that way with a bit of vinegar on a damp cloth. The well of the can could be larger but as the size is smaller the weight is not too heavy to be handling as you reach to water plants. The spout is nice and long and reaches among leaves and stems nicely. I keep a gallon container handy for refilling and at this time I need about 3 gallons back up. I couldn't handle reaching to water plants with the weight of a gallon or larger so the small size works well for me though a 6 cup water well would have been nicer and would have garnered the item a 5th star. It is overall, worth the money spent."
1,"If you like overpriced junk, you'll love this",Basically the title says it all. I figured for a 100 dollars I would get a nice green and that the break would add to the challenge. Basically this is a poorly made toy that shouldn't cost more than about 20 dollars much less a hundred. Like I said in the title if you want an overpriced piece of junk then you hit the jackpot with the Tru-Break Putt 'n Hazard. The only thing this is a hazard to is your wallet.
1,"Horrible, Cheap, Waste of Money","I got this thing as a gift from a discount house - I think it cost something like $70 at the time. Regardless of the cost, this thing is just terrible and barely works. It is made of cheap plastic; so cheap that the flimsy tilt mechanism is hard to keep together much less roll putts over for any length of time. The carpet is also cheap, thin and not padded. I have owned several putting greens and this was by far the worst I have ever had. Please look at other options."
1,pitiful,"never worked straight out of the box. paid shipping for replacement and they sent the wrong part! poor operation, pitiful."
1,Poor Quality,"Very poorly designed. Poor quality! Unusable, very disappointed with product. Ball return does not work. Back stop falls off on its own.Tilt mechanism is useless."
3,I love Firbank because he's not p.c.,"And he writes well. It's true the books are somewhat obscure, but so what? Firbank doesn't take anything seriously. Everything is a fantasy. You float through a world of handsome choirboys, old ladies talking scandal, schoolgirls preening for marriage. Corruption is everywhere, and no one points a finger. I think his best novel is his last, ""Concerning some eccentricities of Cardinal Pirelli."" His earlier works ramble a little. ""Cardinal Pirelli"" is set in Spain and is sort of a satire of the Catholic Church. If you take certain things seriously, Firbank is not for you. But if you are open minded and would like to read something different from most novels, you may enjoy him."
4,Red Hat Linux for Dummies.,"Absolutely good for the beginners, but if you encounter the problem while you are installing the red hat linux, sorry, it didn't tell you how to fix it as this book assumes all the installation is smooth."
4,Great for complete beginners to Linux,"This title, as it suggests, is great for the complete newcomer to Red Hat Linux, and it focuses on those migrating from Windows operating systems. It teaches basic commands to navigate and very basically run a personal RH Linux machine.DON'T buy this book looking for a resource that will show you how to administer a Linux machine. DON'T buy this book looking for a resource that will show you how to set up a Web/e-mail/FTP/SSH, etc. server.DO buy this book if you have never really used a Linux machine, and are looking for an introduction. DO buy this book if you are sick of Windows and are looking around to see what other opportunities are available.Once again, this book serves as an excellent resource for beginning Linux, but don't expect it to offer any more than that."
1,Book fails its fundamental function,"As technical documentation, this book fails because no matter how carefully you follow the instructions, you can't get the task done. In the installation process, you don't even get to see all the screens they describe. Also, this book warns you against installing Linux side-by-side with Windows, then describes ONLY that scenario! Against the backdrop of such fundamental flaws, the approach of the Dummies series is about as cute as a rattlesnake."
3,"Fun, good movies of the week","I enjoyed these movies very much. I am glad that I purchased them so I can easily see them whenever I want.Murder 101 has suspense, drama, some pathos, and a twist in the end. It's not Oscar material, but it's a very satisfying mystery.Gypsy Warriors is funny and kind of cute. It's rather frivolous about a serious topic, but it's good for a good-hearted chuckle.I purchased the disk for the ""Murder 101"", but Gypsy Warriors was worth the watching as well."
3,It's NOT pink!,"This is a nice product, but I only ordered it from this company because I thought it was pink like the picture. The trays are RED."
2,Overhyped,"Frank Hewitt has been receiving alot of publicity lately as an overlooked gem. After listening to this disc, I am not sure where this comes from. His solos do little for me. He doesn't really seem to be going anywhere and at times, appears to get kind of lost. Whatever his ideas may be, they get lost in lengthy statements that, basically, ramble and sometimes stumble.There is some decent ensemble work here, and Ari Roland on bass and tenorman Chris Byers do some nice soloing. But the overall effect is so so, particularly since the leader disappoints."
3,3 and a half stars,"Very slight, but enjoyable, mystery set in England immediately post WWII. Hare writes elegantly and amusingly about the local orchestra of which retired barrister Francis Pettigrew has become treasurer, more or less against his will. The plot is a mere trifle, but the social commentary is delightful. (The Markshire police are especially well observed.) Diverting."
1,Defective sensor for parking,"I recently bought this unit for our 2 car garage. Once installed, I found that the sensor did not work unless I personally rub my finger over the sensor while standing on a ladder. Number 1 problem = DEFECTIVE!! Gosh, It seems as if I only buy defective stuff lately. The unit is really not well designed. The grooves in which the lasers are set do not give much range of the beam so that the driver of both cars can see the beam in front of them. The unit also did not slide over the base when screwed properly to the ceiling.Very disappointed in this device. I would not recommend it to anyone."
4,works as advertised,"As noted in another review, the better way to supply power to this device is probably thru a garage door opener light socket. My garage door motor has two locations for a light bulb so I replaced one w/ a socket and ran an extension cord part way to the laser unit. While the laser unit will take a 9-volt battery, it didn't last but a week or so.Locating and mounting the device is pretty easy and straight forward. The only downfall is that the adjustment of the laser is only in one axis. To compensate for this once the unit is mounted, simply adjust where the dot is located on or in your vehicle for your parking reference.The laser is bright enough even during the sunny daylight hours. My garage doors face the south and we have no problems seeing the dot on the dash of the vehicle when parking."
5,Who needs a tennis ball?,"Works exactly as advertised! I picked up two of these and mounted them above the spot where I park my truck and my wife parks her car. The beam comes on when we pull in the garage, we line it up with some feature inside the car that is easy to see, then it turns off after 10 seconds of not detecting movement...every time. Note that you can only adjust the laser in a linear fashion (not a circular fashion). So make sure you line it up pretty close to where you park your car. For my truck I have it pointing straight down through the sunroof and the laser hits my center console where my shifter is. Perfect parking every time.What's not to like?We skipped the battery backup. When we are without power the last thing we worry about is having a guide to park our car...and who wants to be swapping batteries all the time?Highly recommended."
5,Simple device that does the job.,"After reading the other reviews, I had to speak up. I've tried it all: the garage bump, the stop light type system, etc. You mount this unit on the ceiling and point it to a specific point on your car so you know where to stop. In my case, I point it at the dash. When I enter the garage, the laser turns on and because the laser is very bright, you can follow it as it tracks along your hood. If you set it up right, this helps you set the distance between your cars or the side garage wall. For example, you can set it to run only the seam of your hood or the middle crease if you have one. Then when it reachs the dash, I watch for it to land in a specific area and stop. A successful park, usually with only an inch or two variance. It so rocks!"
5,Love it totally,Both my husband and I have had trouble getting his pick up in precisely the right place so the garage door would close and still have room to walk in front of the truck. This has solved the problem. Works exactly like advertised.
3,One star off for each misleading statement,"The laser parking guide works well and is easy to mount and adjust. However, I felt it necessary to remove one star for each misleading statement on the package.First, it says it can be powered by either battery or AC adapter. In the directions, it states that the battery is only for when there is a power outage and will not last for more than a couple of days. This is important because you probably will have to install an outlet for it. A 6 1/2 foot cord most likely will not reach from where your garage door opener is to where this needs to be mounted.Second, it claims to be able to mount with double-sided tape. Again in the directions, it says not to use the tape on the ceiling. Since that is the most likely place to mount it, I again consider this misleading.Other reviews can give you information on how well the laser works since apparently YMMV. I just wanted to alert the potential customer before they buy."
1,POOR DESIGN - Company doesn't stand behind their products,"4 of these broken. 2 sent back to the seller. and one back to MAXA. Tired of paying shipping I am repairing the last on myself. Where the light meets the unit, it is cheap plastic and cracked on 3 of the units, the 1st unit had a bad battery. They are not so reliable. I would say choose a different brand!!!"
5,MAXSA Innovations 37310 Park Right Garage Laser Park,easy to install great product just need my wife to become complient with the red dot great stuff good bye
5,A great Laser Garage Park system,"If you are worried about hitting your garage wall while parking you car, you can now rest at ease! This Garage laser system is perfect to avoid fender benders in your own garage. Just set the laser to mark a favorite spot on the front of your car and you can always park your car in the same spot. The product is easy to install; it requires only an awl and a screwdriver to mount the park right garage laser. The laser will last about two years before it weakens in light strength. Go buy one today and see how easy it is to park your car in the same spot EVERY TIME! You will thank me for recommending the product."
1,Won't use this supplier again,"This is the second Laser Park I ordered from this supplier. The first was fine - an original item, in the original package, delivered promptly. I ordered a second one and I'm not sure what I received - it was packaged in a generic cardboard box, looks nothing like the first one I ordered, appears at best to be a knockoff and at worst a refurbished knockoff. I tested it and it did work - but I wonder for how long. Delivery was prompt.I won't use them again. I would recommend that you not use them either unless you know exactly what you are going to receive."
3,"Good parking aid, but.......","A good parking aid, but it could use greater sideway adjustment. I would buy it again."
5,Great Item - Helps me park my two cars without hitting anything,Great Item - Helps me park my two cars without hitting anything
4,great product,we ordered this dual laser park light for our garage and it works great. The installation was easy. we did not have any problems pointing the laser correctly. The shipping was fast. Thanks
4,MAXSA Laser Park 37310,"I bought this for my wife who has a hard time pulling her SUV in far enough. It was easy to install (about 30 minutes). Since I did not mount it directly inline with the vehicle, it would have helped to have another pivot axis on the unit for adjustment of the laser. Works great."
3,"Operates ok, limited functionality","When I first saw the claim ""park in the exact same spot every time"" I wanted it. Then I realized it only means in the forward direction. A small piece of scrap 2x4 could perform the same function for a lot less money. Until they come up with a unit that does forward AND side to side placement of the car, this is going back.--VS"
1,Backup option suggestion,"I think that in case of power failure, you can add a piece of string tied to the ceiling with a wine cork or tennis ball tied to the end. This can not only give you continued functionality in case your power is out (your door opener has backup power too, right?), and depth indication, but will also give precise side to side alignment too. Just pull in and steer so the cork kisses the windshield right in front of you.For that matter, just throw away the cheap laser thingie and just use the string version. Using a high tech electronic device for such a simple task is just stupid."
1,A total flop,"I thought this would be a fun book as I generally love mysteries set in [...] culture. But there wasn't a single believable character in this melange of bad writing, absurd plot points and unlikely events. This book is a disaster. And ""A Tony Allegro mystery""? I think not. He disappears in the first chapter and doesn't surface again until the end. Don't waste your money on this stinker."
3,You think you know but you really don't,"I read the other reviews and I have a few comments about them. First I must say that maybe, YES the author is not perfect and YES maybe he is not the best writer or thinnest! I must also say that I know personally that the author does know more about homosexual lifestyle, drag shows, and drama (I can almost guarantee) than both of the reviewers. I can certainly say that the characters are based on postively true characters!!! Maybe your life is not filled with these types of colorful people and that's why you found it hard to beleive. I am so knowledgable because I know the author from ""a distance"" and I was present when alot of the book actually took place. I must say that Gavin was dead on!!! An interesting read for anyone on the party scene heavy from 1998-2001 in Miami, D.C., Philly, and Rehoebeth!"
4,Personal interest,"I am German and inhabitant of the german town Oberursel, where Ray Toliver's Story mainly happens. I reside just a few miles away from the former ""Interrogator Camp"", which was later (after World War II) run from the U.S. Military Forces for more than 25 years. The time when american soldiers lived ""next door"", was my youth, and so I had a lot of contacts to all the american people I met there, and today I have a lot of fine memories. The story and the description of the whole terrain of the later ""Camp King"" was a good opportunity to complete my knowledge about this place.Good stuff also for all americans which are interested in the U.S.-German relationship after WW II!"
2,Ten great pages...,"... but the rest was boring. The book is more about the interrogator himself (his experiences, who he interrogated, his life before and after the war) than about his interrogation techniques. Those techniques, while interesting, could have been covered in a 15 page magazine article. Additonally, the editing was *horrible*: the 'U.S.' instead of 'us' error (as in 'the three of U.S. went to the park') was especially grating."
3,overkill for engineers with a high erdos number,"Very elegant but not too practical for a working engineer. Endless mathematical proofs to get to useful tools. Some of the homework problems are ""good research topics..."". Arrrrrgh..."
2,Med student,"This works and I guess you get what you paid for, but I suggest getting a nice hammer. This one has absolutely no weight on the hammer head, and is very difficult to elicit reflexes from."
1,horrible!,Product arrived timely but that is it!! Cheap and looks nothing like the picture. I definitely would not let my daughter use this for clinicals.
1,Black reflex hammer,"The paint came off and bled onto my tuning forks when I put them together. Other than that, just a reflex hammer."
3,"Looks good, but unsure how long it will last.","Seems like a sturdy reflex hammer, but it looks like a single nail is holding the rubber head to the holder. Seems sturdy, but we'll see how long it lasts. For the price it's probably worth a try."
3,OK,"Reasonably priced. Not weighted properly for easy, professional use, but serviceable for backup, infrequent use. Exactly as advertised. Nice color, different that the usual. Had the same reflex hammer for many years, eventually was lost, rarely used in my specialty. Arrived quickly via FedEx, no issues with sender."
1,Not weighted well,This percussion hammer isn't weighted well so it doesn't swing as good as others. It is also way too light.Spend a little more and get a proper one!
5,One of the best LCD TV,"I saw lots of LCD TVs. I did not buy this TV because it was cheap but , I found this TV one of the best in LCDs. The picture is highly detailed.The LCD technology as such inherits some problems like dark seens are not very clear, but that problem exists in the TVs like sony too.The picture quality is one of the best out there. The HD channels come out amazing and the 480p channels come in very good quality too. I never used its speakers as I have home theater.Pros-- Great picture quality-- Great priceCons-- Only 1 HDMI port. Should have atleast 2 HDMI one for cable and one for DVD but the picture through component is pretty amazing too so this draw-back is livable."
2,Great while it works,"We bough this tv 1 year ago. it broke down last week we had two weeks on the warrenty so i called them and what a joke. they ask me to fax the reciept which i did they informed me that they will let me know in two days where to send the unit a week later no e-mail. called them with an avergae waiting time 45-60 minute, Been transfered 3-4 times to tell me that they have not got the fax and have to fax it again. Now it has been 18 days waiting for the e-mail nothing yet(i hope american express will do the replacemnet for me soon)Olevia they have the most deplorable customer service. thankfully this one broke within the warranty period of the first year (which should tell you something right there).It is such a headache getting any warranty service from Olevia that it is almost worth buying a new set from someone else (go to COSTCO).or buy extended warrenty"
2,"No customer service, and remote control is defective","I selected this model primarily because of its price. Unfortunately, the remote control is defective. It will turn the volume down, but not up, and won't turn the television on or off. I contacted Olevia to request warranty service using their website, but two weeks later have received no response. I called the number listed on the website, but was disconnected after being placed on hold for about 10 minutes. The television itself is really more of a monitor. It didn't have enough connectors for me to connect both a cable box and a DVD player. I had to buy a device that would allow me two switch between the two."
1,Great TV for the Price,"I like the fact that you can save money with not having a tuner that you do not need. The Monitor is light and was easy to hook up. The picture, even not in high definition is great. DVD's look great on the screen, although the picture in widescreen does not fill the screen as you would think it would. That is the one downside to this otherwise great television."
1,Quit working correctly after 1 week,"Due to the ultra low price of this TV I decided to get one for the bedroom. It worked great for about a week now the picture scrolls up and down consistently. All of the inputs starting doing this besides the composite connection. Now it does it also. Even the logo jumps when you first turn the tv on. The volume is another problem. When watching DirecTv, the lowest volume setting is still sometimes too loud and there are no adjustments. I have contacted support about this issue and they said I had to ship the tv to California at my expense. They said if I am worried that the same issue will happen again that I should have bought an extended warranty. I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Great tribute to a great band.,"It helps to enjoy this CD if you are already a Twisted Sister fan, because then you can appreciate the way these talented bands paid tribute to one of their main influences. Aside from Joan Jett's terrible butchering of ""We're Not Gonna Take It"", this is an enjoyable listen. The tracks that stood out for me are: Motorhead's ""Shoot 'Em Down,"" Chuck D's ""Wake up The Sleeping Giant,"" and Sevendust's ""I am (I'm Me)"" (Sevendust pulled off a rare feat: making a cover that is better than the original). Get this if you're a true S.M.F."
2,should have been an abortion,"How can this have all these great reviews? I can only assume that these reviewers escaped from a mental institute.so the majority of the songs on this CD are terrible! LIT? come on. And who ever told Cradle of Filth they had any kind of talent should just be ashamed of themselves.The Anthrax's cover of Destroyer is great and Can't Stop Rock and Roll by Sebastian is pretty good.Joan Jett singing We're Not Gonna Take It sounds like it's being played by the Brady Bunch.The Fu Manchu cover of Live to Ride is alright, I expected better.Like most tribute albums this thing should have never been made.I would have given it one star but I just couldn't bring myself to do that since it is tribute album to one of the best bands ever...Thanks"
4,80% of it's a good job,"I can really only recomend this for a very hard core fan. The bands did a great job on it except for Chuck D. What do they call this? Twisted Sister rocks and that was just horrible. Kid Rock would have been better at doing ""Wake up the sleeping giant""."
1,Very disappointed!,"Image, a book about a famous artist, will all kinds of information, but ZERO pictures of either him or his paintings. Other Pollock books are better. If you must have every book about this artist, ok, get it, but put it at the bottom of your wish list."
2,Too Much Gloss,"Last year I used the Mary Engelbreit's ""Life is Just So Daily"" calendar and it worked out well. For a change of pace I ordered the Boynton calendar and although I like the graphics, I discovered a big problem. The glossy paper does not accept pencil very well, so I'm forced to use pen or permanent marker. Since schedules are always changing, I prefer to use pencil and will probably end up replacing the Boynton calendar with the Engelbreit."
2,Where am I?,"Maybe it's just me, but with the dates of the month printed vertically down the side of the page, I have a hard time telling where we are in the month at a glance. I prefer the conventional calendar layout."
5,Brilliantly simple,"I have 2 schoolkids, husband, preschooler & a nanny schedules' to manage on top of mine. This does it all.A quick glance in the morning and I know if Nanny has to leave early, if I've forgotten a birthday party, if there's a soccer- piano clash.... Can't manage without it.And the cartoons won't fail to cheer you up which helps when you're completely overwhelmed. Moms! get this!!"
5,mom's calendar,I love this calendar. It took some getting used to but now I'd never go back to a regular calendar. It is a great organizational tool for this mom with 3 kids and a traveling husband. The stickers are a cute bonus too.
4,Foghat still rocks!,"Foghat - Official Bootleg DVD Vol 1 (2002-2004)Foghat still rocks even with two of the originag members gone. Decent video and good sound, two songs alone, ""Honey Hush"" and the extended version of ""I Just Want to Make Love to You"" were worth the price of the DVD, Enjoy!"
1,Don't buy this Samsonite umbrella,"I thought that a Samsonite brand umbrella would be high quality, but I was very disappointed. I had the umbrella for only six months, and one of the rivets came apart on one of the metal supports. Now it is useless because one side of the umbrella droops down. And no, it was not from the wind. It broke when I opened the umbrella; there was no wind and absolutely no rust on the metal support structure. I found out that a co-worker's Samsonite umbrella also broke recently although she had her umbrella longer than mine. I have a small umbrella that I use most of the time, so I only used the Samsonite umbrella a few times during the six-month period. My order was fulfilled by Amazon. I checked the return policy and it is only good for thirty days and the item has to be in original condition, so it cannot be returned at this point. I think I will just go back to buying cheap umbrellas from the local drug store."
2,Quality Subpar,"Overall, the umbrella looks nice and is quite compact, but the quality is definitely lacking. After about 4 months of use in light storms, never in heavy rain or wind, one of the metal rods on the canopy came apart. Now the whole thing doesn't quite close or open correctly."
4,good umbrella but still susceptible to the wind,"The claim that this umbrella cannot be flipped over by the wind appears to be true, at least I never saw it happening for over half a year of using the umbrella. However, to my great disappointment, the wind still found a way to damage it: one day when it was particularly strong, it bent the shaft, and the predecessor of this umbrella could not be closed anymore. I bought a new one because I wanted to give this model a second chance."
2,Good for three months.. then it reversed and broke,"This is advertised as windproof, and does a pretty good job up until the point where it fails. There was an unexpected gust of reversing wind that turned this inside-out. Unfortunately that seemed to do it in. One of the cheap aluminum veins in the frame broke completely in two. That was surprising, considering this replaced the cheap $10 umbrella I've had for years, which has reversed countless times but held up (I wish I hadn't lost that one, or I'd still be using it...).Not sure where I go at this point.. time to look at the cheap $10 umbrellas or shell out even more $$$ for a supposedly higher quality umbrella?"
3,Samsonite Umbrella,"The button on the top somehow got unscrewed and I had to screw it back in, but other than that, the umbrella works just fine."
5,excellent quality,The umbrella appears to be well built and I have always liked the quality of Samsonite products. I have only used the umbrella once so far in strong winds and the umbrella did not invert.
2,Not strong against the wind,"This umbrella is a disappointment. The video shows it not turning inside out in a wind tunnel. I don't know how they did that because mine regularly turns inside out in any strong wind. The only difference between this umbrella and one that doesn't have the special windguard venting is that it doesn't totally break when it blows inside out. However, today when it did, the wind bent the handle."
3,Durable But Clunky To Close,"I live in New York City and was tired of my umbrellas flipping over in the wind. I purchased this Samsonite for its sturdy, stylish look. It performs well but has one major problem: closing it is a pain. The glider is rough and irritates my fingers when grasped. It also requires a lot of force to bring down and lock in place, I often need to push the umbrella against a wall to secure."
5,A Serious Umbrella,"This windproof umbrella is for those days you need protection from heavy rain and wind. Coverage is a bit wider than the typical carry in your bag umbrella, but not as large as a golf umbrella which would be too big to walk the streets of New York City without banging into people. I had used a Totes Stormbeater umbrella for years, but they discontinued manufacturing that size and now only offer huge windproof umbrellas which is not practical for NYC, or you can get a smaller size at the outlets which is great to leave in my bag, but the larger size 41 inch canopy is what I grab when there was serious wind and rain. The Samsonite handle is comfortable but could be a bit thicker for a sturdier hold. Other than that, I am very happy with this purchase."
1,Rod bent down on the first day,"Took it out for the first time today. Admittedly, it is quite windy today (15-20 miles/hour). Was walking with my friend who had a $5 umbrella. Both our umbrellas flipped but this one's rod also bent down near the handle. The spokes didn't break and flipped back but now i can't open it using the open button."
2,So dissapointed and wet,"The umbrella feels sturdy and opens with a force. No problems closing. On closer inspection I notice the stem part feels kinda flimsy. So I'm standing in line waiting for this place to open up in the rain with my new umbrella, when all of a sudden a gale of wind rain comes blowing, and it flips this umbrella inside out. I was so pissed. The wind was not that strong. In fact the other people in line who had regular umbrellas had no problem. The problem is with the wind release on top of the umbrella. The wind release skirt is on too tight, and unable to perform its wind release function. Another problem is that its too small, my sleeves and sides were getting wet. If your like me,average height and extra large, your gonna end up getting wet."
4,Something to keep the rain off.....,"Great umbrella. Convenient carrying case, sturdy construction, and quick drying. One drawback, the umbrella should be a little bigger. A male adult barely fits under it."
2,Worked for sometime - no longer usable,The product worked for sometime and suddenly I see some holes on the polyester and it is completely useless. The polyester material is not of high quality. I am sure that I havent misused it and it was well kept/maintained. I havent used the umbrella that much and the lifetime warranty considering the shipping and wait times is a waste of time.Looking for another umbrella any suggestions?
2,"Broke rather too soon, unfortunately","Ack... hate to be dismissive of this umbrella, but like a few people here it looks like I got a dud one. For a few months it worked very well. It even held up in some strong Chicago winds. It felt solid and kept me dry. But, unfortunately, today it just gave up the ghost. I've been super careful with it, but a big spring somehow popped out of the shaft and I couldn't get the umbrella to fold back.I'm a little disappointed. Evidently some people have had a great deal of success with this umbrella, but alas, not me. Perhaps there are occasional issues with quality control here and there.Worth noting too: it's pretty large when folded. It fit into my backpack, but just about, so those seeking a compact umbrella might need to look elsewhere. I did like its solidity though, just too bad it bit the bullet so soon."
2,Worked Fine For Three Weeks...,"I purchased this umbrella due to the great reviews here and elsewhere. It held up fine in moderate weather for about three weeks until yesterday. Upon leaving my residence, I pressed the button on the handle to open the umbrella and the canopy, quite literally, flew off the end of the stalk. It was really very entertaining, but my efforts to fix the umbrella have failed. The lifetime warranty necessitates that I send $5 and wait six weeks to receive a replacement. Needless to say, I'll be getting something else."
3,Average,Its just an average umbrella. Not worth paying the premium as it takes on the wind just as other good umbrellas.
5,Gershwin on my mind or Rare Gershwin,There are so many of my Gershwin favorites that are featured in this CD Album.The selections are just swanderful and rare. I have a few of Gershwin's CDs by different artist and this is one that I do not have to worry about any duplication or repeatition. The piano rendition by Jack Brent keeps one to follow the melody to the shower room. It just lingers in one's mind for a long time.
2,worth it for two tracks,"I like ""Sugar Town"" and ""Somethin' Stupid"", and it was worth purchasing this disc even only just for those songs; however since I like only two tracks on 'Sugar' it's only worth 2 stars, and if I'd thought hard about it I might have bought the Greatest Hits disc instead of this one.At any rate, buying this one leaves open the possibility there may be other noncompilation Nancy discs to buy-- but frankly (no pun intended) how could there be anything better than ""Somethin' Stupid"" and ""Sugar Town""?"
3,"Confucious say, ""People who live in lime houses should maybe paint 'em a different color.""","This album features Nancy Sinatra singing dixieland jazz versions of standards, with the exception of two new songs done in a more modern style which were written by producer Lee Hazlewood (""Coastin'"" and the hit ""Sugar Town""). Honestly, the dixieland style is not the best showcase for Nancy's voice. She is more suited for the type of pop music that she had hits with. Not a bad album, but not one of her best, either. The CD adds two bonus tracks, the hit singles ""Love Eyes"" and ""Something Stupid"" (with her dad). The track listing says ""Love Eyes"" is in stereo, but it's actually in mono."
4,Charming even if a little melodramatic,"He lays it on pretty thick at points, and can get really sappy. The theology gets pretty weird at times too. Still it does a nice job of cutting through the clutter of Christmas and bringing back a focus on the kind of ""person"" God is. I like it."
5,Beautiful story of a mother and daughter,I had to finsh the book once i picked it up. I have read all three books writen by Raina and I enjoyed them all. No Second Chance brought me back to Hyannis - I visit there every year. You'll enjoy Raina's straightforward writing style.
5,Powerful and exciting,The setting is Hyannis and the season is summer. Harris describes the place wonderfully. The story has a great ending!!! it was a pleasure to read this one.
5,Action packed Police investigation,The book grabbed me from the first chapter until the end. I liked the smooth method Harris used with the police investigation. Every move had a purpose. I liked the chararters and how Harris handled the two who were mentally disabled.
4,Powerful characters,I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the characters. Harris has a good writing style which made the story easy to read and follow. I really felt for the mother of a handicapped daughter - caught between wanting to help and make things easy for her daughter and wanting her daughter to survive by herself.
4,Pleasant and Wonderful Story,"I'm so glad I found an author worth reading. I don't like some of the books that have ""over the top"" violence and language. Harris writes a great story with likeable characters."
5,Another winner!,"Harris does it again when the characters from The Captain's Fund and Smoldering meet up with a new character, Meagan. The twenty something mentally challenged Meagan brings a cohesiveness to the story by her independent contacts with the different characters. She also brings a special eliminate to the story with her struggle in sheltered independence and the relationship between her and her mother - especially when haunting warnings keep drifting in from her late grandmother.No Second Chance is a great continuation of the team from The Captain's Fund and Smoldering. And what a cliffhanger! I am definitely waiting anxiously for the next one."
3,Volume 3 fills in the holes,"This DVD contains the following episodes of ""Oh!Mikey"":17 - The Twins and an Alien25 - Rags to Riches26 - Super Princess Isabella27 - The Twins and the Princess28 - Mikey, The Ladies' Man30 - The Twins' Mother31 - The Message Game34 - The Twins' Birthday37 - The Twins' Treasure Hunt41 - Traffic Light43 - That Sinking Feeling44 - Mikey The Criminal46 - Broken Promises48 - A Celebration in the Kawakita House49 - Mikey the Imposter51 - Let's Go to the Beach52 - Mikey Turns the Other CheekStars lost for the haphazard arrangement of episodes across Volumes 1-3."
3,Space bags,"I have ordered the set of 3 large space bags at least 3 times. When they work they're great, but probably 1 out of 4 doesn't keep out the air. I just throw that one away as it isn't worth returning the set. I've found this to be true of the sets I buy at the local store. Now you know what to expect. Shipping was quick."
3,3 out of 5 compared to the best Lynch Hung,"Here's the deal with this album... It's good, not great. It doesn't even compare with Season of Da Siccness. There doesn't seem to be any direction... it doesn't really go anywhere. Aside from the usually cryptic lyrics, the compilation is just that... a compilation. The tracks seem disjointed from each other and there really isn't a sense of consistent flow.Granted, lyrically it's innovative and shocking, but to the average Lynch Hung listener, it's been heard before. The album simply puts new (usually poorer) production to previously heard rhymes.It's not bad... It's not great... Although I wouldn't be surprised if the album was thrown together in less than a week by removing the old beats from the lyrics and just using them with new beats."
4,Siccmade4life,"This album is the best of Lynch. Lynch is commin with that raw style. What i like about Brotha Lynch is that he says anything he wants. Nothing holds him back. So this best of album is all of lynches tightest joints. If u dont own any brotha lynch albums, i guarantee you would love this, and if u own all of brotha lynches albums u have most of these songs, and u might still wanna get this cause it does have some re-mixes. But commin from a true lynch fan, i love every bit of this."
5,this is the best cd i ever heard,this is the best brotha lynch there is....all on one album....siccmade music with ill flows and tight ... beats...and there is some remixes to...buy this cd if you like tight beats with vulgar lyrics
2,2 out of 5 it is not that good,"This is a CD that I really did not like. There are a couple of good songs, but the rest i just cannot help but skip through. This is something that i find very anoying. I hate it when there are songs that really bother me. Most CD's do not bother me in this may but this one did, hence the low score"
2,good not what i expected,i felt that whispers on ice was a good book. I just felt that this was a somewhat fantasy that this author had on Katia and Sergei which is kind of freaky. Also i don't feel it's a nice book i mean after all this book was inspired by Katia and Sergei and for me it's awful that she writes a book about how she probably thought the relationship of them was. I felt really bad at the end of this book the way this book was inspired or by whom. I recommend it if you don't know much of katia and sergei but if you don't well then it's a good book to pass time.
3,Not as good as her other books!,Earlier Susan Johnson books are great this novel has no substance. What has happened? Seduction in Mind doesn't measure up to anything she has ever written. It is just one boring sex story. I am actually apprehensive about buying her next novel. Susan Johnson has always been one of my favorite writers I have never read reviews before I have bought her books I will now.
1,Rated X reading,"I thought at one time I really liked Susan Johnson. This book was so sexually graphic I will be embarrassed for people to know I read it. I rarely tell myself . . . ""Throw this one away . . . I'm too embarrassed to pass it on to the Library sale"". What a waste of time. I really don't think (in this time period 1878) this female character would really exist. YUCK! I'm glad I found it on clearance at Goodwill."
2,Just ok,"This book is definitely ""just ok"", the main characters Alex and Sam don't excite me at all. They lust after each other but don't seem to like each other. They fall in and out of bed, with no real plot in between. I usually like Susan Johnson...she usually tantalizes her readers, but also makes the characters interesting and fun. Towards the end I didn't care what happened to Alex nor Sam, even the sex was repetitive and boring. I will continue to be a fan but I was very disappointed in this effort. Hopefully this was an exception."
1,what a TERRIBLE book!,"No plot, flat and completely unlikable characters, and forced dialogue. The main characters have sex non-stop for a few days then suddenly decide they're in love -- even by romance genre standards, the ""love"" story is completely unconvincing. This is the first book I've read by S. Johnson and I will NEVER read another. I almost didn't vote because you can't give less than 1 star and this book doesn't even deserve that, but hopefully someone will read this and save themselves the time and money that I wasted on this book."
1,"Susan, what happened?","This book is extremely untypical of a Susan Johnson novel. Yes, her intimate scenes have always been hot, hot, hot! But at least there was a plot and a reason to like the characters. SEDUCTION IN MIND is the perfect screenplay for a porno flick - lots of ridiculous sex and a story that goes nowhere FAST!"
1,Awful,Here is a book that is nothing but sex and not good or interesting sex either. I got to page 139 and couldn't continue. One hundred and thirty-nine pages where they don't take their minds or their bodies out of their underware and what is beneath. It is rather much. One might enjoy a bit of a story with the sex....
3,Where's the romance?,"If you're looking for steamy sex, this is the book for you! But in all honesty it should be categorized as erotica rather than romance. The hero is a sex addict and the heroine is little more than one of those ""willing widows"" who has discreet affairs on the fringes of society. Happy ever after is hard to believe with these two people. A nice cold shower should bring them to their senses... and you'll need one too if you read this book!"
1,Soft Porn for the Over-50 Crowd,"No characterization; no plot; just sex for those who have forgotten what it once was!Soft porn wrapped around a weak attempt to describe the late Victorian Art scene. Thank Goodness I didn't have to pay for this fribble! Will I read her ""stuff"" again? Nope."
5,Fans will enjoy!!,"If you never read Susan Johnson books,pick this one up. I could not put this book down. It was a enjoyable book. I love how she put the two independent characters together. Each was afraid of love and each fear how quickly their attraction was to each other.I love how Susan Johnson, use the outside characters, ie. the love shruck artist, the interfering family members to keep the 2 characters away from each other. All the outside characters kept reminding her, the viscount will never be faithful.I love how Susan used the history at that time period and how women was view has a independent and self-knowledge women who did not need a men for guidence.If you are a fan go out and purchase this book!!"
5,ms pam,Love this product. Hydrating body balm is excellent tanning. Would recommend this product. 5 out of 5 stars.
2,Boring and not what I expected,Not a lot of details about Iron Maiden. Mostly talked about British rock music. Was a gift to my husband who is a huge Maiden fan and he was very disappointed. Which made me disappointed that I spent $25 bucks on this when I could have bought him an Iron Maiden tshirt instead.
5,A Voice in the Wind,"Francine Rivers will never cease to amaze me. This was my eighth book to read of hers, and I have not been disappointed by her yet. This book had a lot more history in it, and could get a little boring occasionally. However, I think all the history was helpful in understanding the rest of the story. This IS a historical book after all. I loved everything else about this book and you will too. I highly recommend it.I received this book for free in return for an honest review."
5,THE BEST HISTORY LESSON I HAVE EVER HAD!,"An excellent story set in the first century A.D. The first in a trilogy spanning the Roman Empire. It follows the story of a young jewish girl, left alone and taken into slavery after Jerusalem is left devastated by the Roman army. Several threads are running throughout the story and the characters are interwined as certain events take place. The author's research is superb and the historical facts throughout the story are very interesting. Certainly the best history lesson I have ever had. This is an excellent book. My first by Francine Rivers and one I would definitely recommend"
5,Who wouldn't want to be like Hadassah?,"Francine Rivers is amazing- and this is the series that proves it! When you read this book, you are instantly transported to 70 A.D.; her characters are so vivid and realistic,they become cherished friends. The character of Hadassah is skillfully written; a woman who lives her life as Christ would have us do, yet struggles with her own fears and doubts. A story that challenges the reader to examine his/her own life. I'd give it ten stars if I could."
5,"all Francine Rivers books are good, but Mark of the Lion series is one of her BEST!!","This is an absolutely remarkable book! The second in the series (echo in the darkness) is also quite amazing! I reccomend this for EVERY young woman and older woman alike. It will challenge your current committment to Christ and make you want to strive to have the kind of faith that the main character Hadassah has. Very encouraging.... better take a day off and have a box of tissues with you... because you'll be sitting and reading this straight through for 15 hours!The one downside: I felt like the first 100 pages in this book were a little slow-going (a lot of scene and character-set up). Its necessary to the story though, and pays off later; so buckle down and keep on reading through those first 100 pages, even if its hard.... you wont be able to put it down once you get into the story! The 2nd book (echo in the darkness) takes off much quicker because you are already engrossed in the story."
3,A Voice in the Wind,"A quintessential romance novel with a Roman era setting. Sufficiently researched without beating you over the head. A satisfying trip into that time with little details thatgave life to Roman society and its interaction with the early Christians and the gladiators and slaves. I raced through it and looked forward to reading it . . . . sort of like having my favorite dessert. I liken it to pecan pie . . . the nuts are reasonably healthy but they are all dolled up with sugar, corn syrup and a pie crust."
4,Jarring,"Well, even as a staunch liberal, I found the not-so-subtle allusions to the real world (abortion, decadence, censorship) quite jarring.This book is about the moral disintegration of a people- an empire so enslaved by their cruelty, their passion, their lust for life, they abandon all that is good and right.Not far, as I'm sure the author would say, from modern day American society.It is well written and a very good read. I highly recommend it."
5,Amazing,"This series contains my favorite three books. Each one is amazing and wonderfully written. I love all of the books written by Francine Rivers, but these are by far my favorites. They impacted my life greatly, and I recommend them to all of my friends. I would suggest that you have the second book waiting for you when you finish the first. You won't want to wait. =]"
5,One of the Best of all time,"Hadassah is one of the most incredible characters ever created in any genre or form. Never before have I become so attatched and so inspired by a fictitious character. Her journey inadvertently becomes your own. At least it became mine. I found pieces of myself in Hadassah, as well as traits in her that I hope to one day achieve.Because of her main character, Francine Rivers makes ancient Rome come alive once more and allows the reader to live vicariously through her heroine, as well as Atretes and the Valerians. It is a novel of substance that truly inspires you to be like Hadassah and try to emulate CHRIST. Her agape love for her owners, especially Julia, is, like the rest of the book, gut-wretchingly honest and heartbreakingly beautiful.Hadassah is a heroine every mom should want for their daughter. I know I'm saving my copy (along with the rest of the series) to pass along to my kids."
2,Disappointing,"I had looked forward to reading this series of books, but I was very disappointed. The first few chapters were boring and difficult to get into. I did not appreciate all the bloody, gory details of the killings in war and in the gladiator arena. There was much explicit sinful, sexual information that was way beyond my comfort zone. Not at all what I expected from this author. I want to see what happens in the rest of the series, but I will not be purchasing any more of them. I may browse through them if they show up at the library."
1,Dull,"I don't know what all the hype is for this book. I absolutely loved, loved, loved Redeeming Love, fabulous read. This book went know where fast, I kept waiting for the story to a start, but it never came. I felt like I was reading a boring high school history book.I stopped reading by the 6th chapter, what a waste of money."
5,I love this series!!!,Ancient Rome is a mirror image of modern day USA. Extremely memorable characters... exciting plot lines.... accurate historical information. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!! Read all 3 books. I pray every day that Ms. Rivers will write more about these folks!
5,Wonderful!!!,I absolutely LOVE Amazon. Everything I have ever bought through Amazon has been premium!! I have been more than satisified. Thank you Amazon for chosing quality people we can be at peace about ordering from because we know you have us protected.Janie Heatherly
4,It'll get you thinking,"While reading this book, I found myself thinking about my devotion to Christ. It's a book that tells a wonderful historical fiction story. It did take me until about page 70 to really get interested in the story. Don't be discouraged if the beginning drags a little, you'll love where you end up."
2,Windy Brendy,"The story starts out well, but soon jumps to new characters that you haven't established a desire to follow. It is also too violent! I couldn't finish it due to the violence and the poor storyline."
5,Life-changing,"As with most Rivers books, this one if life-changing. This series is what the Lord used to bring me back to Him after 3 years of trying things my own way--what a gentle Lord He is. I highly recommend this series. The characters are believable, you feel for them, you get an amazing view of historically-accrate content, and you get a better sense of how God works in life (even though it is fiction). It will challenge your walk with the Lord, in a good way."
5,Powerful book!,This is one of the best books I have ever had the pleasure of reading. It is one that touched my heart and really made me stop and evaluate my own walk with God and ultimately strengthened it. The book is historically accurate and illustrates the hardship and persecution that Christians were forced to endure a generation after Jesus walked the earth. It also shows how Roman culture was in that time. The characters and the plot are well developed. It's very easy to sympathize with the main character. The story is gripping and keeps the reader hooked until the very end. Make sure you start the second book as soon as you finish this one. You'll be glad you did!
5,History and Entertainment,"Oh, how much I learned from this series! The historical accuracy was amazing. Someone worked hard and researched thoroughly to complete this work. I found this book graphic and difficult to read at times, but the great story line kept pulling me back in. Now that I've completed it, the ""rough"" areas are now the very things I appreciate most about this compelling book.Great suspense. Great romance. Excellent history.You simply must read books 2 & 3 also. (Everyone I know who finished book 1 went out and bought book 2 the very next day).Enjoy!"
5,Hmmmmmm.......,"This book is great!!!! My older sister ordered them and then when I heard about them I just had to read them!!!! They're the best books I've ever read and I hope there are more like them!!! Francine Rivers completely rocks this world!!! It's so cool how Hadassah goes through things and everything!!! I love her trials and how she stays with God, it's something I hope I'd be able to do in the same situation. It's cool!!!"
2,Meladrama anyone?,"This is a story that is mostly told rather than shown with a tendency to restate the obvious, making the effort amateurish at best. While the storyline showed promise, it never evolved into anything more than a book filled with a sense of preachiness that would have been more effective had it allowed us to experience the story through its characters. Instead, we get characters with the fan fiction definition of a Mary Sue and Gary Stu with an over-done narrative description."
3,Religious....,"Well written, BUT, I will not purchase anymore of her works as she spends far too much of the book preaching for page after page. It's very easy to skip thru these sections but why should I pay for half a book of religious text. Happily she does balance this out by not using these same seemingly inserted sections of religious philosophy for gratuitous sex."
5,A Voice in the Wind (Mark of the Lion #1),"This book was purchased as a gift for a friend, and I was completely satisfied with the condition of the book, the speed with which it arrived here, and the accuracy of the description on Amazon."
4,A Good Beginning,Beautiful. This has to be the best Christian book that I have ever read. The characters are so real as are -most- of the situations. Francine Rivers has a very gifted style of writing-I couldn't put this book down once I started it and rushed to the bookstore to get the sequel after I finished.
5,Great start to the series,This book got me excited about reading my bible more. It helped me to understand the pressure and trials of Christians in the Roman period after Jesus' resurrection.
4,Good but graphic!,"From the moment I picked up the book, I was drawn in. This was a good story that was interesting and well researched. I felt that I was given a pretty good idea of what life in ancient Rome was like. Once I started the book, I wanted to know what happened to all the characters. I would have rated this book 5 stars except for one small thing. I sometimes found it too graphic for comfort. I like that Ms. Rivers portrayed the time period exactly as it was without whitewashing it, but I don't see this book being one I will read again and again. It is a well written book that definitely leaves an impression. To me, it was also disturbing. It is definitely worth reading but not for the faint of heart."
5,An absolute must,"I am awed by Francine Rivers, best author I've read. Her research ability is admirable. Wish I could have read this when I was studing Roman History.This is my favorite out of the trilogy, which was mainly due to my amazement for the talent of Rivers. Her character development spans numerous profiles, her factual details of Hebrew life, the Fall of Jerusalam and the Roman Empire, places her in a reputable class of a Historian author, and how she weaves theology into the mix is awesome.A must for every Christian Library & Home.I strongly suggest AN ECHO IN THE DARKNESS standing by, you won't want to wait."
5,The character of Hadassah,"The storyline was exciting. The characters were great. I used to read ""love stories"", but not any longer since this series. The heroine is a homely (not like your ""love story beauties""), teenager, a slave, growing up in Rome. I have found Hadassah the most beautiful person. I would love to know a person like her. Her total faith helps mine grow stronger. If I were not already a Christian, I would run, not walk to get Baptized!!"
5,This book is a reflection on our world!,"This was a GREAT book.....but it's kinda scary that in so many ways, this is a reflection of our OWN world! The culture and society of Ancient Rome are so like our own that it makes you wonder.....are we so different from those who put Hadassah in the arena?Anyway, I absolutely LOVED this book! I can't wait to read the others!!"
5,The best...,"Here they are, the band wich comes the brazilian greatest rock singer/composer Rita Lee!Everything she does is just perfect"
4,Legal!,"Worth a listen, if only for the beautiful 'Fuga #II' - a tune that Paul McCartney would have been proud to have written.The other standouts are 'Baby' and 'Panis et Circenses' - one of the most catchy songs ever written."
2,"""Everything is Possible"" but don't buy everything","What drugs do I need to take to make this sound good? So many raved about this group so I bought a cd. Big mistake, HUGE. I'm such a sucker."
1,Discouraging,"These blocks just don't stay together. My son was aggravated making it. I had to hot glue some pieces together, they just would not snap together."
5,Great value and a nice gift...,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for our friend's son. He loved it and put it together immediately. He is 8 years old, an experienced builder and put it together by himself in under 30 minutes. Perhaps I should get him a more advanced set next time. I would recommend this for a younger builder or perhaps a beginner builder. Nice quality and excellent price."
5,You need this book,"Every working class person/student/new parent/dot-commer needs this book. Never has poverty and lack of full cabinets been so fun. I love that this book is indexed and arranged by ingredient. In know that everyone has at least one item sitting in their kitchen that doesn't look enough to eat, let alone something worthy of sitting down and eating.With this book you will be able to create something out of seemingly nothing. This book helps ease the pain of not being able to afford take-out, let alone the drive-thru. It is a wise, wise investment."
2,Not that great,"I got this book because I wanted something I could use to cook with. What I got is some boring recipes. Also if I'm looking for something to eat at night (and having not gone shopping), I'm kinda screwed. A lot of the recipes have ingredients people won't have on hand."
2,Very disappointing.,"First I'm going to say: I'm 20, I love Prog music and thus, I love Kansas, and I even met Steve Walsh once. But this album is weak, it kinda starts out strong, but ends in disappointment. I've tried to listen to it, but none of the tracks really stand out. Its not that its bad, the production values are good, and some of the riffs are kinda cool. But nothing stands to far above mediocre, the music is okay but not great or really all that progressive either. Lyrically it pretty weak(I fear Walsh's Creative juices have run dry), but after all the great songs Walsh is written with Kansas you gotta give him credit for trying. One the main problems is I think Steve Walsh's voice is about shot. He just can't belt it out like he used too, and this is apparent on this album and the recent Kansas live recordings.Fans of Walsh's other solo work, or fans of Kansas's post-1970s sound may find something to like here but to me its a letdown."
2,What happened to his voice?,"The reviewers before me here must be rabid Steve Walsh fans. I personally don't care for any of his solo work. The material on Shadowman is banal at best, the musicianship uninspired, and Walsh's voice sounds tired and as though he is singing through a cheesecloth. What did he do to his voice? None of his solo material holds a candle to Kerry Livgren's work solo, or as projects with A.D. and Proto-Kaw. I used to love to hear Walsh sing and have seen Kansas live three different occasions. He was magnificent. Arguably the best voice ever in rock! Sadly, this dog has had his day... I would recommend this only for avid Walsh fans..."
4,"Smart adult pop, trying to do the right thing","Michael Tolcher's debut CD gets better the more I listen to it. The CD is primarily adult top 40, and alongside potential pals like Will Hoge, Graham Colton, and John Mayer, what Michael offers that is different is kind of a search for virtues that other guitar singer/songwriter stars sometimes overlook.Take ""Bad Habits,"" for example, in which the protagonist is striving for life lessons and experiences to be a better person. ""Mission Responsible"" sounds to me like encouragement for a father to do right by his baby's mother and future family. ""Sooner or Later"" consists of good advice to a daughter who has a lot of questions but doesn't necessarily want the answers from her folks, but they love her and they'll give it anyway.I don't think this is Christian pop, but damn, if you're not feeling a bit uplifted either by the words or the sensible and effective guitar/percussive elements, I would be scared to meet your children someday."
1,Disappointing.,"The album cover alone should clearly suggest that this album is not good. The whole peace sign is cute, but a little lame if you ask me.I saw Michael Tolcher live, and it was a good concert. The album however, is not. Most of the songs on this irritate me ten seconds in, and there's not a single track here that is truly enjoyable.Michael Tolcher has ripped off bands on this album, and has even admitted to it during his live performance. Half way through the song Miracle, he started singing the words to the Four Non Blondes song ""What's Going On?"" The chord progression is exactly the same, as is the melody.If you're looking to discover a real musical treat, steer clear of Tolcher. Check out Stephen Kellogg and The Sixers, Matt Nathanson, Ari Hest, etc. for similar artists who are actually talented.Oh yeah, and I'm not thirteen."
3,Enrique?,Come on not another Enrique. Michael looks exactly like the latin pop star. His music is somewhat appealing... to those of the age of 40 and over. Don't get me wrong the cd was not bad I reviewed it for my school newspaper. Just think things are a little mellow. Maybe thats his style of music. I dunno. Good Luck Man
5,ALL MIDSOMER MURDERS DVDS,"Midsomer Murders, Set 20I love these movies. I've got all they ever made. John Nettles is sensational.I'm always looking forward to the next set at the time I'm watching the current set. If I could give more than 5 STARS I would. To me they rate a ""10"". Please keep them coming."
4,the series continues,"if you enjoyed the previous seasons, this is a must to continue. Not too may episodes thobut still enjoyable"
5,good service,Arrived on time. It was a nice ending to Baranby retiring. Nice to have the close captioned as wish some of the earlier series had it
5,Midsomer Murders set 20,The product came without any problems. It was on time.I have loved this series and have all the sets now withBarnaby.....but I cried as I learned he is retiring andthis was his last video. I hope the following videoskeep me watching??? But I so loved the series with thefirst Barnaby!
1,Wouldn't Play Properly,"My wife has collected all the episodes of this series, so I felt confident in ordering the newest set. When the first one arrived, none of the disks would play at all -- the ""ACORN"" logo would appear after loading the DVD, but then nothing would work. Using the ""next chapter"" button or the ""play"" button didn't accomplish anything. Since all our other DVD's continued to work just fine, I arranged with Amazon to return this and to have another sent to us.The second arrived and also failed to play normally. My wife discovered that if she pressed the ""next chapter"" button while the ""ACORN"" logo was being displayed, she could get to the episode, although only after having to watch a long series of previews of other BBC shows. Trying to press ""play"" at any other time didn't work, so we returned this set also."
4,"Alas, the last one!",Good stories and John Nettles is as likable as ever. I'm so sorry he is no longer in the series.
5,Thanks,Another great addition to our Midsomer collection. especially at an affordable price. We look forward to adding more sets as well...
5,A sad farewell to John Nettles.,"Well this is where John Nettles leaves the series. I think he has done an exemplary job and I look forward to his ""cousin"" replacing him. Only time will tell if Dudgeon can pull it off."
3,Disapointing,It was a very disappointing farewell. How can the writers think that we are going to believe such a transfer? If they tried to lower expectation for the next series they did it. Only one really good story on par with the past.
3,Stories not up to par,I wanted the complete set of Midsomer Murders. But the stories in set 20 were disappointing. They didn't have the quirkiness that all the previous stories had and which made watching interguing and enjoyable.
5,Midsomer Murders Set20,"Unbelievely great. I have loved all the Midsomer Murders that we ordered. Can't wait to see more. Will miss John Nettles in the titled role. Hope he will come back. He has that great chemistry, that makes a great show!!!"
3,Nice words; questionable provenance on the art,"The works featured in this book, attributed to Georgia O'Keeffe, have been discredited as fakes for over a decade. The Kemper Museum (where they were purchased and displayed) demanded the return of the purchase price and I believe that was done years ago. Here is a reference to the story: [...]It's still an interesting book, with thoughtfully selected quotes from O'Keeffe, Willa Cather, Edward Abbey and others. But understand that you likely aren't viewing O'Keeffe's work."
2,Dead Battery,"Came without working battery, not easy to find this battery, naturally. Company would only reiburse 50%. Will have additional expense for sizing. This was not convenient or a cost savings. Would not purchase a watch from the internet again..."
4,4 Years and Running..,"I've had this Sony NPFF51 battery for about 4 years now and despite heavy-duty usage the battery is still going strong. The battery fits nicely onto my Sony DCR-PC109 MiniDV. Charge time is less than an hour.Actual usage-time is slightly less than the advertised 2 hours; and even less still if your are using the flip-out moniter instead of the viewfinder.Overall though it is a nice little work-horse that has withstood the test of time. For even casual users I recommend an extra battery just in case. And for that extra battery, I recommend the Sony NPFF51-F Series."
4,Good sampling,"This set samples Stans activity from 1950 to 53. It starts out with 11 tracks of early quartets followed by 5 quintet tracks with Jimmy Raney and 8 with Johnny Smith. Then you hear 11 tracks with Jimmy Raney from the ""Plays"" lp, a particularly creative and swinging set followed by 12 tracks from the 3 volumes of Interpretations with Bob Brookmeyer.The fourth cd is the Live at Storyville lp with Jimmy Raney. There's almost 4 hours of early Stan although I would prefer the complete albums instead."
3,sizing is off,"Cute costume but the sizing is off. We bought this for my small 4yo for Hallowween. The body of the costume was fine since it is a round bug but the leg opening was snug. We didn't snap the legs for trick or treating because it would have restricted her movement. My daughter is only 34 lbs. This should say 2-3T. Otherwise, no complaints."
2,A lie,"I bought the custome based on the picture showed. But, when I received it I felt completely dissapointed since it was incomplete according to what I saw in the picture. Reading the features I realised I made a mistake ordering this ""incomplete custome"". I didn't receive the tights nor the tees."
4,Not just for guitar players!,"This is a great study in music theory for anyone wanting to learn improvisation. You will find as much text and diagrams as music, so be prepared to block out some quality study time! Aside from the exercises, which are annotated for guitar, and a few other areas, the book would be useful to anyone wanting to learn more theory.The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the book might dive into hardcore theory a little too fast for some people. Personally, I like it because of my academic background, but the book might be accessible to a wider audience if it had just a bit more introductory material."
2,Defective structure - too heavy to be built this way,The smaller folders are really good. But this big size came to me falling apart that the inside clear display section fell off the cover. It looks to me to be structurally defective because of the heavy weight making it impossible to stay in place. Returned
5,Tired of buying frames? Looking to get wall space back?,Being an avid concert poster collector getting this item was a dream come true. After spending hundreds of dollars on frames and running out of wall space this product was brought to my attention. Its construction is great and its made to last. It's a great way to show other people your artwork without giving them a tour of your house and another plus is that your collection is now east to transport. So far i have two and i like them so much that ended up removing 90 percent of my posters on the wall to put them in these portfolio's.I hope they make larger sizes in future. I consider this to be the ultimate coffee table book.
5,Art Porfolios - These are wonderful,"I bought 2 of these, at that price I could not pass them up. They are $50 everywhere else. They are heavy duty and with 24 sleeves, that is a lot of room for your pictures. And the delivery was quick, within 5 days. Thank you."
5,"Beautiful, professional quality portfolio for presentation","Book is aesthetically appealing, and durable. I was initially concerned that the plastic cover might scratch easily, but that has not been the case at all. Book can only hold approximately 25 page holders (50 pages inserted back and front with professional photo paper) comfortably; provided page holders are archival and do not smudge or dent (plastic and paper) easily. Only dislike is tiny blue square painted on top outside of spine of binder! Perhaps this was done to help the portfolio presenter identify top from bottom? Can't say for sure..."
5,Awesome Product,Pros:- sturdy- doesn't smudge my workCons:- the ad says their is a free sketchbook but it didn't- the plastic sleeve is damaged
5,Universal Traveler BEST VERSION,"This UPDATED CLASSIC EDITION is one of the BEST DESIGN PROCESS BOOKS I use as a Design Professor. This book was first introduced to me by my wonderful professors as an undergraduate student in 1979, I have and continue to use this book for myself and for all levels of art and design students from high school to seniors in college. The Universal Traveler helps us to understand that Design is a Process and a Journey. The authors have created an easy way for anyone to understand how we can make use of slowing down and looking at each phase of the process. Each stage of the design process is explained in detail giving the user tools to use immediately in their life and for their life. I highly recommend this book."
5,GREAT story!!,"I REALLY enjoyed this book! And, despite what a couple others have said, it DOES follow the ""rules"" that were said in the series; in that it IS possible for Sam to leap into the past. That was said in the episode where he leapt into his great-great grandfathers body, during the civil war."
5,Great Monitor,"I was worried that this would be a waste of money believing firmly in the you get what you pay for motto. But I guess there are always a few exceptions to the rules, this is a great TV with a crystal clear picture. it was easy to set up both our cable box and the video games. Just remember that it don't have a tuner, for the low tech people that means you need to have a cable box (or VCR) to change channels. Great display for the price."
1,LCD flat panel failed,"I bought the Olevia LCD because my brother in law recommended it based on price and quality. I liked the picture and ease of use, until the picture went out- black screen. dead, kaput. It worked for about 6 months, and was never moved or mistreated in anyway. Olevia said this was a ""unique"" case, but when I googled around I found that I sure wasn't the first. They said it would cost $575 to replace the panel b/c I ""failed"" to purchase an extended warranty. I replaced it alright, replaced it out on the street for garbage pick up. For the record my brother in law's LCD still works, and I'll buy another LCD, but not from Syntax/Olevia. Do your homework, don't trust my brother in law, and get something reliable. If you need further info feel free to respond and I'll provide more details."
4,Awesome value,"Didn't like that Amazon only advertised a black model and we got silver :(. Performance-wise, it does excellent. HDTV comes off pretty crisp. It works well as a computer monitor. Cordage was a little bit of an issue. Make sure your cords and adapters are in order for immediate use. Price is generally amazing and I'd get a larger one in a second!"
4,"olevia 32"" hdtv","Great price, great look. The tv however, has a couple problems.1. Often times the volume abruptly mutes without notice and requires us to restart the TV in order to regain the sound.2. Also, sometimes when you attempt to turn the tv on, the screen does not show a picture. In order to get a picture, we must again restart the TV.It's kind of annoying, and may be an indication of a larger problem, but I'm no tv expert so take these comments at your own discretion.Overall, however, I'm satisfied with the product."
4,LCD HDTV review,"We are very pleased with this TV--the clarity and color is great. I noticed the people seemed to be squashed, but I think I can change something on the viewing to remedy that...just have to read the instructions! Great price...I could never afford a $2000-3000 TV, so this is the poor mans substitute!"
3,Ok but not a Sony,"The picture is good but doesn't dazzle like a Sony, I guess you get what you pay for."
3,not so impressed,"after reading the highly rated reviews for this product, I went in to a circuit city store and viewed this baby. I was not very impressed with the quality of the image. three screens down from this baby was the samsung 32 inch version of their LCD flat screen. the samsung was must brighter and cleaner than was the Olevia. the price was $400 more. but, if you want to view a great picture on a flatscreen display, then get the best picture."
3,More like '3 year',"As far as design it's on par with other shocks, and wore well.However, the screens started to fade (battery began dying) after only 2.5 years of normal use - it became very hard to read. If you buy this with an expectation of not having to replace the battery within a few years, look elsewhere. Otherwise a fine watch."
4,"Good to make the baby exercise, get tired and fall asleep",Used it sparingly to keep my 6 month old son entertained while we caught up with chores. He loved to hit the frog on its head. Good thing is it doesn't need any batteries. Easy to clean and easy to disassemble.
3,Serves the purpose,"It serves the purpose in getting my little one going, but if you pick it up to move from one place to another the parts will seperate."
2,Baby Walker,"The item has a design flaw, it's well documented (front legs do not snap and lock in a position). Amazon should not sell this until it's corrected."
1,Product is not safe,"Length:: 0:23 MinsSafety 1st Grip 'N Go WalkerThe walker is unsafe. The walker falls apart when my baby leans on it. Please see the video for a better explanation.I am fairly competent at assembling things and I might have received a defective product. I don't know. I normally do not submit reviews but I thought this might be important for parents.Perhaps I got a defective one. However, I can only rate this one star and this item will be returned or thrown in the trash.Best,"
4,good walker,The service by target is very good. Item arrived in good condition and quite fast. The walker although is not as colorful as it seems from the picture but is good enuff to keep my son engaged. It is safe and at the same time glides both on carpet and vinyl floor.
1,Too high for 4 months,"The walker is advertised for 4 months and up. Our little one is 5 months old, normal height and is still not close to reaching the floor. Maybe it should be call the hovercraft- because that's all baby can do on this. To add insult to injury, it was difficult to fold up when we realized we had to put it away for a couple more months. If your 4-5 month old baby is Wilt Chamberlain Jr., go for it, otherwise hold off. Boo!!!"
1,not good,Under the lid you have the two legs that hold it up well the right one wouldn't snap so it kept on falling while the baby was sitting in it.
1,Don't bother,This item is useless as baby can't touch ground nor reach any of the toys. Ours is sitting in the garage as we couldn't take it apart to return.
3,"Nice, but too high","Very beautiful product, great price, however, it is too high for my daughter. I think it's perfect for a very TALL baby."
2,"Ok, for a moment","Received this as a gift and only used it a few times with one child, and the seat broke. Called Saftey 1st and they want $20+ to replace the seat."
4,Great for a mover,I was given this walker from a friend who's child progressed so fast he skipped the walker stage. When I brought it home my son instantally fell in love with it for the shear fact that he could move around pretty freely he really enjoys it. It is a little basic in design and I have found that the toys do not stay put for very long they are not made very well and are very basic. My main problem with this walker is that it is a pain in the butt to put away it doesn't fold up easily and it doesn't stay folded for very long. I also am having problems ajusting the height of the walker my friend put it all the way down and now I can't get it to go back up so my son's is basically standing all by himself when he is in it (which I am not complaining about).
3,hard to collapse when you want it too,"This walker was hard to assemble. It falls apart easy. At the same time, when we take it to the babysitters house, we cant get it to collapse properly, and end up re-attaching the legs when we get there. The legs are constantly popping off when Baby is playing in it. This walker is so giant, there is no way for Baby to walk around in it. She mostly scoots a few inches around. She does enjoy looking at her feet thru the see-thru plastic tray. This walker is truly a mess and I dont recommend it."
5,Great Walker,"This walker has been great for our 9 month old daughter. She moves around the first floor of our house with ease, and the walker itself is wide enough so that she can't open drawers, cabinets, or pull things down off of counters. She loves it, and so do we."
5,Value for Money,"I was hesitant in taking this walker after reading some negative reviews. However, after reading reviews for other walkers, this appeared to be relatively inexpensive risk and I took it. To my surprise, this turned out to be a good deal. My baby loves to walk around in it. Installation is easy.I'd recommend it if someone is looking for relatively inexpensive, less jazzy, efficient and safe walker."
2,not as good as reviewed,"I purchased 2 of these baby walkers and was very disappointed at the quality of the product. once i got the package and i wanted to return it but the shipping was almost as much as the walker. it came together pretty easy, but the high was not adjustable. the back wheels was fixed and can't turn. only the front wheels trun. its too bid and took too much room."
4,I know students who will benefit from this book!,"A Book of Hope for Students includes issues pertinent to students using adult conversational tones. It is a wonderful collection of meditation and journal topics that students will deal with during middle school, high school, and even college. The book emphasizes the benefits of a strong work ethic, takes the time to express the characteristics of successful individuals (creation, motivation and determination), and develops honor and integrity as pieces of the person every student should want to become. A Book of Hope also includes inspirational sentiments on the fulfillment of life and the meaning of the journey to others and us."
1,Dont bother,"I bought this as a second bench grinder for knife sharpening using buffing wheels so i wouldn't have to swap my stones out for cotton wheels all the time, and it doesn't even have the torque for buffing a knife!!! I use a Sesale wheel and a cotton wheel with buffing compound and you can hear the motor start to strain as soon as the sesale wheel touches the metal. I also stalled it out with a PLASTIC bottle..... no way its a 1/2hp don't waste your money."
1,do not buy,This grinder has very little power and starts very slow. When it finally gets going it is ok but I would not recommend
4,Tests to evaluate your general knowledge of subjects,"Do you feel you want to brush up on a subject? Is your American history a little rusty? Do you want to impress someone with your art history knowledge? Essentials of Cultural Literary will provide you with the fundamental knowledge to brush up on a subject. If you enjoy learning, this is a fun way to see where you knowledge stacks up on the scale. After taking each subject test, there are not only answers but detailed explanations of the answers. The tests are not only fun but present a digestible amount of information. This book is certainly an enjoyable way of testing your knowledge on a gamut of subjects. This would make a great book for taking on the plane or waiting in line!"
3,Great for New and Old Cheerleading Coaches.,I thought this book gave great ideas that all cheerleading squads could use. Although I did'nt like that the stunting pictures were all of very basic stunts and that they showed drawings of the jumps instead of real pictures.
5,A Cheer Coaches Bible!!!!!!,"Believe it or not I used this book to build an entire cheer team from the ground up. I carried this book around, highlighted, and flagged pages and used the pre-printed handouts for everything. I would have falled flat on my face without it. There are chapters about every possible obstacle, what to expect, and how to run your squad. My squad went from being a ""joke"" at half-time with 10 people watching to being a ""crowd pleaser"" by the end of the year with over 100 people coming just to watch my girls. I was very proud and thank God for this book!"
5,Great!,"I absolutely loved this book. I am a novice on creating a cheerleading/twirling squad for my school so this book proved to be very informative. So far, I've only read the 1st chapter and beginning of 2nd chapter and it has given me a fundamental basis to start from. For example, how to get your philosophy going, goals and expectations for the squad and school community, communication between peers on squad, appreciating your school and community and getting them involved with supporting your school, affirming and motivating those on the squad and personnel in your school. When it comes time for me to present my plans to administration in my school, I will be very well prepared. Thanks Linda Rae Chappell for making such an insightful guide for those aspiring twirling/cheerleading coaches to create squads in their school. I feel this a lost art!"
2,This book has almost NO pictures!!!!,"I didn't actually read this book, but my coach has it and it has hardly any pictures, how is a coach going to teach a team to do stunts and jumps if she can't see how they are supposed to look? and all of the jumps that there are pictures of are not anything really neat, we were looking for some exciting jumps and stunts to do that other teams woulden't be doing in competition, and we didn't even find all of the stunts we already had."
3,vetyver by lanvin,"usually a great item but be careful with purchasing cologne thru amazon, could be dated thus having strong alcohol smell."
2,Missed change,"Unfortunately this is not a good movie. Crucial events of one of my favorite books are not found in the movie. With giant steps the director walks through the story, Alain Fournier's popular Le Grand Meaulnes. Camerawork is ok. Acting not bad. It's nice to see France in 1910. But director Verhaeghe should take the time to tell the story of Augustin Meaulnes, his strange adventure, mystery of the lost castle, the story of the gypsy and so on."
2,Look for the 1967 version!,"I was happy when this showed up on my French TV channel, TV Cinq Monde. I assumed it was the 1967 classic. But no. This 2006 film is not awful, exactly, but it is pedestrian and conveys NOTHING of the enchantment of the book, which was caught so well in the '67 version."
3,Excellent CD,"I only purchased this cd for one track, so keeping that in mind, this cd was excellent."
3,"5 stars for the cover, 3 for the music","This album is not as good as it looks. The duet with her father is no competition to ""Something Stupid"". The Lee Hazlewood songs are not his amongst strongest, except ""Sand"" but that has been on so many compilations already. Buy best of instead!"
2,Nancy In One Ear,"Very disappointed in this CD. I love Nancy Sinatra's music and I was really looking forward to this CD, but unfortunately although the CD appears to have been remastered, the songs are all ""separated."" The music comes out through the left speaker and Nancy's voice comes out through the right speaker, so you only get to hear her in one ear if you are listening through headphones. The remastered songs on the compilation ""The Essential Nancy Sinatra"" do not have this problem. I compared the song ""Bang, Bang"" from ""How Does That Grab You?"" with the one on ""The Essential Nancy Sinatra"" and there is a noticable difference. The one on ""Essential"" sounds full, rich, and ""centered."" The other one sounds much thinner and weaker in comparison. Beware!"
5,Very good storage solution,"I got two of these to organize my closet. One for training clothes and out of season items, another for shoes I don't need frequently. Although I would like them to have a one piece support at the bottom, after filling them up I didn't miss it. Very sturdy, great size and good looking. Will buy some more."
2,Not worth the little it costs,"I ordered two of the Rubbermaid 3F23 storage chests. I am returning both. They are much too whimpy for what I intended. I am amazed concerning the size of the cedar inserts; I could not even smell them, they were so small. This item will not stand on its own. It would have to be stuffed full to hold its shape. Sorry, Rubbermaid."
1,Not worth for the price - look for better alternatives,"I bought this based on all the +ve reviews I saw in amazon. I got ordered this last week and received it yesterday, couple of days longer than the estimated delivery, but that's ok. What I felt about this product is - it is not worth the 24 dollars I paid for it. It can store stuff, yeah, but not like the kind of storage you would expect for the money spend. I wanted this to store my off season dresses, but I will need another three or more to actually store them all, and for $24 a piece they are not worth the bargain.I think I might return this back. I might just buy a proper plastic storage bin or something. For like $10, this might have been an ok deal, but CERTAINLY NOT for $24. I am disappointed, because this is one of my bad buys in Amazon - I am usually always satisfied with what I get from A because I do so much research. But anyways, here's hoping someone else doesn't also get his fingers burnt the way I did."
1,Product not as shown,"This storage ""chest"" hardly needs 3 handles since it's so small! In the picture, it looks like a full-size trunk. It isn't. It's little more than a sweater-box and will hold maybe a half-dozen sweaters. Also, the bottom is canvas - not waterproof nor dust-proof.Certainly not what I expected from Rubbermaid! I would not buy this again."
2,Price Changes,You just love it when you order the item to make the two day delivery and the price decreases within one (1) hour. Purchased for $6.00 more and it is very small. Ordered several of these pieces and this is not going to hold and protect ZILCH !! Very disappointed because of the price change and delivery by DHL was THREE days late !!
2,Where's the Cedar???,"The cedar inserts are extremely thin and extremely small and there is absolutely no ""cedar scent"" in the chest....even after keeping it closed for over 2 weeks. It's not a bad storage box for the price, but I prefer the plastic ones as they are sturdier, stack-able and easier to clean - this ""chest"" will not hold up to stacking unless the item on top is significantly light and, keep in mind that it's fabric so if you're keeping it in a basement or attic, it may be an issue. I kept it but wouldn't buy another."
3,happy with my purchase,"I just received this today and I couldn't be more pleased. I bought it with the intention of using it as a lingerie storgage box and it couldn't be more perfect. The size os about one size smaller than a carryon piece of luggage if you're having trouble gauging the size by the discription. This will be perfect for my intended purpose because it will be easily stored just about anyplace I choose to put it, and it looks nice. The price is also right.The only real complaint that I could even possibly come up with is that the zipped closure does not seem to be the as sturdy as it could have been, but no real biggie, not a deal breaker."
4,"Holds a lot of stuff, and matches other accessories.","This storage container holds a lot of my out-of-season clothes and is just the right size to fit on my Rubbermaid Configurations shelf. It is attractive and there are lots of other matching products to go along with the Rubbermaid closet system, my favorite being the 2-pak nesting bins. The cedar inserts, however, aren't what I expected--there are two, approximately 1"" x 4"" and about the thickness of an emory board. Not a big deal though and I do plan on ordering at least one more for storage."
2,"Okay, but nothing to get excited about","It's an adequate piece for basic storage, but not as protective as I expected. There is no moisture barrier, so this is strictly for dry areas. And the cedar inserts are teensy-weensy, too small, I think, to have any deterrent effect. I didn't smell any cedar aroma at all. The only upside is it's collapsible when not in use. I'll use it, but I won't be buying any more like this. Other pieces in the same series are a much better value, which is why I bought this one. Recommend only for clean, dry storage use."
3,It's Okay,"I used to store my winter clothes and put in the closet. I usually use storage bins, But works fine too. Not too sturdy soft canvass material.I am happier with the storage bins."
2,Not good for transport...,"I purchased this product as a gift for someone and the intention was for carrying the organizer and not just storage. While its a great storage product and if that is why you are purchasing it, it's great. It looks nice and will match any decor but for anything other than sitting somewhere in your house, it doesn't hold up. The bottom and top material are super flimsy and when you carry it, you can't carry it by the handles, you have to carry it underneath so it doesn't collapse. This product is good for storage but unfortunately it didn't hold up for my purposes."
3,"""Disneyland Hostage"" Is A Pretty Good Book","I just read ""Disneyland Hostage"" by Eric Wilson. It is about a girl named Liz who travels with her aunt to Universal Studos (City) and to Disneyland. They meet a young man on the plane who accompnies them on their trip. She meets a new friend at Universaal and they hang out there and at Disneyland. While at Disneyland they become hostages by terrorists who want to end poverty where they came from. I was first attracted to this book because it was placed at Disneyland( ny favorite place)but it contained so little of the sights of Disneyland and so I was turned off by the book. It was an exciting read but I wanted to hear more about Disneyland."
4,Best coffee substitute,"I have never liked coffee until they started making flavored coffee creamers. Then I was hooked. But when I started having stomach problems, everytime I drank coffee my stomach would hurt. At the time Kroger carried Natural Touch Roma, so I tried it. The first few times I drank it with my flavored creamer it tasted a little different than coffee but it did not hurt my stomach. So the more I drank it [with the flavored creamer] the more I liked it. I have drank it for years. When I ran out of it recently I purchased a small jar of instant coffee. After a few cups of the instant coffee my stomach hurt again. I would give it five stars but as I only drink it with flavored creamer I thought I better not. Some of my friends, who also like flavored creamers, said they liked the Roma as well as coffee also."
2,Nonstandard sizing--chest band small,"Seems the bands on the Playtex bras run smaller than those on other standard brands like Bali or Vanity Fair. Couldn't even close it, and have to return this and another Playtex style I bought. Also unattractive appearance."
4,Very comfortable,"I found these to be very comfortable. The only comment I would make is that the little piece of stretchy material in the sides, from which it apparently gets it name - flex, did not lay quite right on me, so I did a little modification and I now love them."
5,"what term describes ""beyond must read""","The ""Evangalist"" should be sufficient to re-direct the path of contemporary golf course design from its current preoccupation with window dressing and waterfalls to the structural soundness and strategic integrity inherent in Macdonald/Raynor's work. Devotees of this book will require hospitalization the next time they hear the hot architect of the day say that he doesn't want to adapt old principles when there are ""so many new strategies yet to be developed""."
4,Uber Goop Vinyl repair for dishwashers,This is the second time I've purchased this product. It's great at sealing the stripped vinyl on dish racks. Helps the racks last longer. Can't find it in any appliance or hardware store.
4,Dishwasher rack repair,Good stuff! Easy to use and looks great! recommend removing any rust even tho the product doesn't stipulate this in directions.
1,Dishwasher Rack Repair,"I have used a product similar to this before that worked well. This product instructions are to let completely dry before applying second coat. I had to put many coats on and some are still not repaired. If the bottle is left open too long, the product gets thick and gooey."
2,gliew review,"This product would work well if there were minimal rust. In my case, the dishwasher racks were too far gone. I think it would work better given other circumstances."
4,Uber Goop,The goop worked very well for filling in those cracks on the dishwasher rack. It has been holding up well for the past month since I applied it.
4,dishwasher rack repair,I have used products like this before. This one performed the same as previous products. I ended up needing to use lots of it and let it set over night before using the rack in the dishwasher. It has stayed on well.
4,could have used more info,"Product was great. Just could have used more information prior to purchase to let me know that I need the liquid along with the caps for it to work.Did not have any horizontal repairs that needed fixed in the dishwasher and thought I would only need caps. Got caps and found out that I needed the liquid for installation of the caps.Bit more cost and time, but good product."
4,Goop,It works if you grind the rust off completely. Our Maytag is over 30 yrs. old. I have used this stuff 3 times. Sure beats buying a dishwasher rack for an old dishwasher!
4,Uber Goop!,The product worked well on the dishwasher rack. I experienced a few problems with the product congealing on the brush and bottle neck before I was done. A larger bottle is required to repair one dishwasher rack though!
3,Ok product,"I ordered the Uber Goop and the plastic tine caps. The Uber Goop requires at least two coats to coverprepared repair areas, and one bottle is only sufficient for one of the two racks. The brush suppliedwith the bottle is a little too short, and I had to use two of my own little brushes to get all of theproduct out of the bottle. It dries quickly on the brush and in the bottle opening. A recommendedsolvent would be nice, so that you could reliquify the stuff that starts to dry in the wrong places.Time will tell as to how long the repair lasts, but I am pleased with the initial results."
4,Works great.,"We will eventually replace our older dishwasher, which despite its age, still runs fine. In the meantime, this stuff works great where the dishwasher detergent has etched off surfaces on the racks--lots better than the $200 + shipping, handling and tax to replace the upper and lower racks on an appliance that is worth next to nothing."
2,Uber Goop aptly named,This product may actually work well however even when using it quickly and repeatedly closing the bottle it goops on the brush and it goops in the neck of the bottle and requires constant wiping away not to mention that the gooping results in a lot of waste...had to reorder because perhaps 1/4 of the bottle gets lost because of the gooping. Definitely do not let it get on your fingers.
4,Casey's Grammy,Great little toy for the curious little minds. Easy for little hands to make baby happy. 8 month old can learn to make it run and enjoys making it move over and over again.
2,Dissatisfied,"Book did not arrive in very good condition. Very poorly packaged. It was a paperback (for some reason I thought I ordered a hardback) and a product originally from Scholastic Books. I ended up paying more than the cover cost from Scholastic, once I included shipping, etc. and was disappointed by this as well. I already had a hardback copy of the book and purchased this one as a gift. So I knew that the book was / is great. Every family should have a copy. But just not from this vendor."
2,Pulp fiction heroes,One of the greatest of the pulp fiction heroes of the Golden Age. This version however was totally lacking in imagination and special effects. Could have been a lot better. Transfer from film to DVD was not the best either.
5,20 Ton Log Splitter Review,"I have had a chance finally to use this splitter and it performs as expected and is easy to maneuver. I would highly recommend this unit to someone looking to split wood for personal use. Easy to start, runs smoothly, and thus far has split all my hardwood up to 14 inches across."
1,Absolutely Distraught!,"The trucking company (Loraine @ ABF) phoned and left a message on my home answering machine, disclosing the item which was to be asurprise/gift. I'm curious how they got my home phone number, when I provided my cell phone number for this order.Have you ever gotten engaged? This is like calling to tell you your engagement ring is ready BEFORE the proposal. It's very disappointing to experience this level of discretion during the holidays, or lack there of!Absolutely Distraught!"
5,Practical and powerful introduction,"Highly recommended. This text is encyclopedic. As an MFT, I used the book more by itself than in conjunction with an overview class. Want to learn about the ""discredited"" TAT or Rorschach Inkblot? Great--this unbiased book has extensive information on ALL major tests, which will enable effective research in other sources. I was able to use this text to intelligently confer with professors, constructing a more modern, TAT-like test for the specific population I work with."
2,Booooooring,I purchased this CD for one song and regret the purchase. Should have used iTunes for the song.
3,THis ones ok,I bought this after his more recent works. This one is more different then those. Having said that its still his beautiful voice so I just left off the songs I really dislike on my ipod.If your a fan you should still check this out.
3,As So-So as 3 Stars Would Indicate.,"Sufjan Stevens is my personal favorite artist and arguably the most talented modern American musician. This first effort from the Michigan native is not entirely impressive when compared to he latest albums, but it still manages to charm just as well as its predecessors. While the folk and banjo-driven ballads of his 50 States series albums are present in this album, it seems more like a failed acoustic guitar pop album to me. It has it's moments, ""Super Sexy Woman"" and ""Ya Leil"" showcase both aspects of Sufjan Stevens. We get his poppy side, and his musical creativity. The greatest aspect of this album is that Stevens never takes himself too seriously, as bits of humor are splashed all over the album. Its almost as if he knew that this album would be a footnote in his musical career, and just had fun with it. In that aspect, it is a fun ride."
3,A good start,"First off, I love Sufjan's work. However, this first album oftentimes does little to indicate the future awesome-ness of Sufjan Stevens' catchy, folksy songs. Some parts drag. Some parts make me cringe. Overall, though, this is a worthy buy for fans of Mr. Stevens' work."
3,A Star Came,"3 1/2Proving to be ultra ambitious ever since day one as far as album releasing was concerned, Steven's low-fi massive debut will be a treat for any fan, but for first timers should be avoided in favor of his newer releases. Mixing his folk roots with early alternative, electronic and world music, anyone listening to Sufjan, would at least take notice, if not necessarily start the celebration just yet. The eclectic songwriter is as unhinged as ever, sometimes wiping distorted chaos into whispered ballad with the ease of a pro, you could already see the vast production intuition amongst the youthful vibe. Although many of these songs do seem adolescent when compared to his further releases, one must at least acknowledge that this is some of the most intelligent adolescent instrumentation that someone so young, yet so open to play, could produce in our sad market."
1,Prices SUCK!!!!,I Want A CD You Have For Sale But You Want 50 Dollars For It!!! Are U Crazy????!!!!!! Lower Your Prices!!
4,"Fun, light pop in a small package","A great soundtrack for an entertaining movie. Rat Race features the title track from Baha Men (including an amusing choral version), plus ""Who Let The Dogs Out?"", the inevitably overplayed but still excellent ""All Star"" by Smashmouth, and a nice clip from the John Powell score. Some of the tracks are mild duds, such as Colony's kinda fun but ultimately wan ""Happy"", but these only somewhat dull moments are offset by otherwise excellent stuff like Hot Chocolate's lecherously fun ""You Sexy Thing"". Watch for ""America Rocks"" by the Hatch-Penny Band as unbilled track 11!"
5,A great CD for a great movie,"This soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard!!! This is a really great feel-good album, cause it's really silly and lots of fun. I think the Amazon.com person went a little harsh on the poor Baha Men (I must be the only one that likes the music they make for movies), who I think came up with two amazingly goofy themes for a really catchy tune. But, come on, Smash Mouth....I think this is the third year in a row I've heard ""All Star"" in a movie, twice this year alone. The rest are all great. John Powell needs more movies to score, because it's great. GO MR. BEAN!!!!!!!"
3,It's fun!,"Here's a fun little CD! Enjoyed both versions of the title song ""Rat Race"", as well as ""Who Let the Dogs Out?"" [those filthy flea-infested mongrels]. Yep, there's an unannounced 11th track though, ""America Rocks"", which in the wake of the tragedy of September 11, 2001 seems to this licensed pilot to be rather a downer to be included with the rest of this goofy, fun compilation."
5,Vintage Buck Owens revived,If this CD isn't in your collection you're missing out on some great tunes.Not only do Buck and Don harmonize on some fantastic tunes but you'll here Doyle Holly on a couple of the tracks.Great deep voice with some awesome steel guitar work here by the one and only Tom Brumley.Rose Maddox is featured in a duet with Buck and Ralph Mooney and his steel guitar make it work.This CD is with me all the time and it gets played.Chalk another one up for Sundazed.Keep 'em coming.
3,crazy frog Cd review,My grandkids love crazy frog and this CD was great but I was dissappointed that it didn't have more songs. I thought maybe it was all x-mas songs but theres only the one.Since I did not read the entire info about it I didn't realize it only had 4 songs. But if your a crazy frog lover its worth it.
5,Mask,"The poems in Mask are exquisite. Many of the poems make a deep contribution to the interpretation of Charlotte Salomon--Berlin-born artist who perished at Auschwitz--her struggles and her transcendent ability to turn those struggles into art. Elana Wolff's poems remind me of the poems of Jane Kenyon, one of my favourite poets on earth, in their conciseness, and also in the translucent way they portray love--even in its darkest context."
5,"Great! Absolutely Fantastic! Move over, Harry Connick Jr!","I love it! I never knew that he sang, now we want more! Danny's rendition of ""You Belong to Me"" is absolutely wonderful! I love this song, and This is the best arrangement I've ever heard. The title of the album is so apropros - ""I just Wanted to Hear the Words"" - you can't understand the words of the so-called music the kids listen to today. You can hear and appreciate EVERY WORD of this CD!Thanks Danny for a wonderful CD!"
5,Cynic to believer - HALLELUJAH!,"Call me a follower now....I have to agree with all the reviews. SUPERB album. For lack of any better definition, it just sounds lush and continues to grow on you until you can't get the songs out of your head. Maybe they put nicotine in the mix ;) Given any choice, grab this one."
2,I can't believe the gushing.,"Danny Aiello the actor...wonderful.Danny Aiello the singer...well, let's just say it's a good thing he has a day job. I am sorry. I am not one to usually put down someone who is probably a real nice guy and works real hard, but this album is beyond bad. Strike that, the arrangements are pretty good but Mr. Aiello simply doesn't have the musical chops to pull this stuff off. I'm sure his friends and family thinks he's all that, and he probably knocks 'em dead at local pubs and at parties, but simply put...he isn't cut out to be a recording artist. His intonation is way off, his timing shoddy at best. He attacks these songs with all the voracity of a toothless old man gnawing away at a juicy steak....Plenty of desire, just no bite!I am sorry if this comes off as being a bit harsh, but I gotta call 'em as I see 'em. Give it a listen and try being objective. I'm sure you'll agree. If not, then I guess there's nothing left to say other than...pass the A-1 and enjoy!"
4,"Felt like i was on ""dope""","If Alexis wasn't in this, honestly, I don't think I would have found it so enjoyable.Face it people, this really isn't great cinema, but I am guessing the producers know this. The scene changes really did get to me , they are quick, and one in particular made me think my disc was skipping ahead , had to check the time stamp twice to see that no, it wasn't a skip, just a whole scene that looked edited out except for the very last part. One thing i will say that wasn't cute, camp or fun was the ownership notice that kept appearing on the bottom of the screen, and it happened way more than once, ridiculous!Alexis was pure fun and it was hilarious to see her mind at work in some scenes because you know she was thinking "" really? am I really doing this movie?""So like i said if it wasn't for her i would have never watched this, or kept watching it once i started!"
4,Queens of culty B Movies!,"I expected this movie to be crap, but it's really quite charming. Ginger, super unbeatable hit woman, and her BFF CoCo, are a fabulous killing team. Well, Ginger kills and CoCo lends moral support. Ginger's boyfriend, Bobby, has been ordered by his crime family to do some hits, but he's farmed out the job to Ginger and CoCo (who do wonderful kills that include drawing fake eyes on the lids of one of their marks!). But when it comes out that Bobby isn't really doing the hits, his family is mortified, and now Ginger and CoCo are being hunted! This is a campy, kitchy film with lots of great moments: ginger on a roller-derby killing spree, the ladies having a tea-party with acid sugar cubes...really quite sharp!"
3,"Entertaining, but sadly flawed","The previous reviewer has the story down pretty well. The author uses current fears of cyber-terrorism to construct an interesting plot... but there are so many things missing or flawed. Characters are developed... and then left unused... and their motivations often don't make sense. Technology varies between easy-to-understand descriptions of public-key encryption and non-sensical radiation mumbo-jumbo. Enjoy it, but don't expect great insight... or great literature."
4,Good but not great,"This is a good book, but I wouldn't call it one of the best. I preferred William T. Grant's book. I can think of two things which would have made this book better, which I have seen in other first person accounts: 1) Continuity - the narrative is split into small stories, instead of flowing. 2) Books which deal with Special Forces or their helicopter support seem the most exciting, and the men seemed to have a tighter friendship which makes me empathize with them. The author mentions there were pilots who continually volunteered for LRRP missions.One unique and interesting thing in this book was an account about the author's 1993 return to Vietnam. He toured several of the battle sites he fought on, and interacted with the Vietnamese tour guides."
4,The Way It Was,"Carlock does his friends and future historians a great service with this book. It could have used a tighter structure, but the combat stories, the day to day living experiences of Carlock and his crewmembers will remain as a testiment to who those guys were and what they did. And why they are still so proud of it. Remember Carlock grew up on John Wayne movies, so it may sometimes have that John Wayne flavor, but it also shows John Wayne results. If you want to live vicariously in the flightsuit of a U.S. Army, Vietnam gunship pilot, you couldn't do better than to take the ""Peter Pilot"" seat next to Chuck Carlock. I hope you enjoy the ride as much as I did."
2,"disjointed, confusing, and boring","I have to agree with the reviewer who called this book confusing. I'll add disjointed and boring. I expected more emotion and what the crew members did and said during their ""heroic"" efforts. Instead, it was nothing but a day-to-day description of his tour, which got pretty boring after a few chapters. I'm glad I only paid seven fifty for it."
4,"""No"" was never in a helicopter pilot's unwritten philosophy","I Corps and northern II Corps were very dangerous places in Vietnam. Artfully recalling day to day missions might seen boring, but when you combine it with happenings back in the World, things are really placed in perspective. Chuck Carlock and the ""Firebirds"" were at the very epicenter of the hodge-podge Americal Division as it was growing into the massive command it would eventually become. All royalties from the sale of book are donated to the 71st AHC Association. Tom Payne, RVN 66-67, Bandit32"
4,A bit too fractured...,"I've picked up and read just about every Vietnam helicopter book out there. While this book is good, it is more a collection of short stories than a flowing book. I found my mind constantly changing gears as a different story was told. The stories are great, no question, but I would have preferred that they connected a little better."
5,Buck Owens is DA BOMB!!!,"I can't believe I've spent most of my life thinking Buck Owens was just some corny, old guy on Hee Haw. The man ROCKS! I've only been listening to Buck for about 3-4 months and in that time I've purchased almost all of the great Sundazed reissues-this one included. Not only do you get ""I've Got a Tiger by the Tail"" and ""Cryin' Time"" but a bonus live version of ""Act Naturally"". To be honest just about everything on this is great except ""Street of Laredo"" which sounds too old fashioned and ""Memphis"" which sounds to rock n'roll. Buck and the Buckaroos didn't need to play rock 'n roll to rock. If you're a fan of country music or '60's music or just plain MUSIC you need to check this out. Forget ""Hee Haw"", leave your expectations at the door and listen."
2,Okay...,"I wasn't happy with the shape ness of the blade...I felt that the knife was made well, again except for the shape ness...I would been happy if it were shape."
5,"Good feel, and just the right size.","This is a very nice dagger at a very good price. The blade holds a sharp edge well and has a good feel in the hand. The sheath is good quality as well. Overall, I'm very pleased."
4,A Review From Hollywood Reel To Real,"Touch This, track 15, is just a nice and naughty adult groove to wet the erotic senses and allows a refreshing escape from moral contraints...would love to jam to this under a soft red light with my one and only....The Duchess"
5,Spyro Gyra you picked the right name for this cd!,Wow you can just tell these guys know how to play with each other what a professional sound. I like there versatility of each song a must get cd. The true meaning of the word team work!
3,"Good but Spyro Gyra ""lite""","I think this particular CD of Spyro Gyra's is OK. Unlike other reviewers, I think Springtime Laughter, with all its changes, is one of the better cuts. Overall the CD does seem a touch formulaic for Spyro Gyra to me, but still a safe bet for those who are looking for a safe bet."
4,Pure magic,"I am no jazz expert but I do love music. If not live,played through quality electronics.GOT THE MAGIC makes me smile and know every penny spent for my system was worth it. I don't know if the switch made to the Windham hill label made a big difference but this CD is produced to perfection! Some people think SPRO GYRA as ""jazz du jure"". Perhaps some of this CD is ""same old"". I would say about 70-80% of it is top notch pure jazz pleasure.Believe me get""GOT THE MAGIC"" it will cast a spell!"
4,Yet another great one from Spyro,"The new style of jazz these days is most definitely headed in a Latin direction. Spryo has endeavored to show us a little bit of what they can do in that realm, but not too much. The only track that sounds a little cheesey is track 4, which sounds like something you'd hear while at the grocery store. They could have developed the bass lines a bit more, but the saxophone work is just right--not overdone like Kenny G or Boney James, but not underdone in the least. I'm a huge Rippingtons fan, so you get an idea where I'm coming from. Pick this one up if you're serious about great jazz music, I promise it won't let you down."
5,If you like the group...,"I'm listening to the CD right now, that's how much I like it. Got The Magic is my favorite track, but Sierra and Silk & Satin are right up there too. A must for any fan."
3,Not the best of SG,"I don't think this album is the best of Spyro Gyra, simply because they've changed the style too much. I like the ""old"" style (such as on '20/20' and 'Road Schulars'). But if you're looking for a good smooth-jazz album, this is one you should consider."
5,Yet Another Great CD,Spryro Gyra just keeps pumping out one great CD after another. Their upbeat style never gets stale. Keep them coming.
3,"It was good, but dry.",This book was informative and well written. But amazingly dry. There is not much the author could have done to prevent this however. It was not a book I couldn't put down. But if you are interested in capital punishment it has good information.
5,Michigan Rolls still rolls,"I had read this in the mid 90's originally and loved it. Just read it again and still enjoyed it. I have recommended this one and Criss Cross (another non series title by Kakonis) to others and it was appreciated. The Tim Waverly character is appealing (ex con-ex literature professor now a card counting gambler) with some remnants and scruples still of his former life in academia. Any dialogue involving the two low lifes sent to retrieve the money stolen from Mr. Big (Gleep and Shadow) or their handler Mr. Gaylon was absolutely priceless. The author is compared in the review to Elmore Leonard - but to my mind he is a little edgier - perhaps more in the Eugene Izzi, Timothy Watts category."
2,for dedicated Sufjan fans only; others won't be impressed,"This was Sufjan's venture into techno music, and it's a good thing he didn't continue this way. This album wasn't what I expected and I wasn't impressed. I am glad to have it to complete my collection, but I'm not sure I'll put it in my cd player much. Don't expect ""We Are What You Say,"" or any ""For The Widows..."" in this one. As I mentioned before, I would've bought it anyway, but you won't fall instantly in love with this one as with others."
1,Not what I expected from such a great artist,"I purchased this album, having already owned his ""Illinois"" and ""Michigan"" albums. My expectations were not met in the slightest. While Sufjan Stevens is hit or miss within his good albums (he experiments, and I dont like some of those experiments), I felt like writing NFG on this CD after I listened to it. [NFG is an engineering term for No F###ing Good] It is an abstract piece of music, no melody, no harmony, no beauty, no meaningful lyrics. Nothing worth listening to, in my opinion. I was heartily disappointed in an artist I am usually praising. Know what you are getting into with this one."
3,Inspired just beats out indulgent,"Interesting early release gamble of highly experimental, non-vocal electronic sketches didn't exactly pay off, but after huge success that followed, EYR is even more appreciated than perhaps its actual worth. Littered with frazzled lo-fi glitch-ery, much of the album lacks cohesion, but a good amount of ""wow"" moments, followed by a continuously solid final stretch makes this oddity worth pursuing."
2,Not electronic- just a bad experiment!,"I would best describe the ""music"" on this disk as noise. There were a few moments when there was music, but mostly it was just a non-harmonic mess. He's done much better work before and since, I'd stick to those."
2,Not what one would expect.,"So I don't have any real problems with this album. It just isn't my cup of tea. It is an instrumental album that is a branch off of the usual Stevens. I would suggest this album if you really enjoy high intensity electronic drone music. I wouldn't call it noise because there was is intention in there, but it is kind of hard to listen to unless this is your thing. I am all about experimentation but buyer beware if you are looking for the normal Sufjan Stevens album move past this one."
1,jive turkey,got this game for christmas and ....theres no game. just the expansion pac! ASPYR doesn't sell the application any longer. What the f?
4,Good way to teach the faith,"I bought this book for my nephew who is 10. He goes to a Catholic school. However his parents do not seem very religious or devout. I am trying to help teach the faith to my nephew and nieces in subtle form. Since the artwork is done by Tomi Depaola, this book will go over nicely. The content is good. Just a tad dry. This is where the artwork will help."
1,awfulll smell,"this is the worst smell! its like a super syrupy caramel. it literal stunk on me. it didnt smell like a sugared apple at all. as a matter of fact i didnt smell any apple. i will say, it doesnt smell synthetic at all just overdone"
2,Invertekk - Baldwin Sales,"I purchased this table and found the leg supports uncomfortable... instructions for use were very poor... I actually hurt myself initially... I bought this table directly from BaldwinPines, Inc. because when I tried to order it thru Amazon it would not ship.. called Amazon Customer Service and they told me to just contact the Distributor directly... at that time it was BaldwinPines Sales... they refused to take the table back... and basically were very rude... do not buy from them....They have a no return policy and are selling something that is not there normal product line.I really can not Recommend this table, it is more expensive and your movement is restricted.Richard"
2,Perfect if you never intend to move it,"This is a great desk - compact, nice looking...but as soon as we tried to move it the whole thing cracked apart and we were unable to repair it. The plywood it is constructed out of is very weak."
4,Not a can,The hose is great and has worked well with the 3 different types of gas cans I have. Only gave 4 stars because it is a little misleading; you do noy get a can just the hose.
1,rfrus,"Overpriced, I am unable to use because there is no gas can adapter included. Save yourself $10 b going to Harbor Freight and purchasing a sipon hose."
5,just right,This was Santa's best gift for my daughter. Very huggable. I liked that it did not have the saddle and bridle aplique'.
5,Quality with great price!,Keeps our larger toy horse company at the barn. Lots of fun and a big hit! Definitely recommend this seller and product.
3,Fine soundtrack...,"I've owned this soundtrack for three and a half years, having bought it for the A Camp song (Persson/Larson). The rest was okay, but nothing really grabbed my attention. In October, I discovered The Execution of All Things by Rilo Kiley because of my fixation with Saddle Creek Records, and it became my favorite album of 2002. Five days ago I discovered that there were two Rilo Kiley songs, ""The Frug"" and ""85,"" in my possession that I didn't even know about, so I gave them a listen. Now I have bonus tracks. Hooray! I just got my copy of Rilo Kiley's Take Offs and Landings yesterday. Hooray! I love Jenny Lewis now. More than Nina Persson."
2,Short range,"The claimed range of 50' is false. I purchased three of these switches. They are all installed in an older home which would make re-wiring for three way switches difficult. Even so, I'm considering doing the work because these switches are unreliable, to use them you need to be standing in just the right spot or your body blocks the signal to the receiver and the light won't turn on. It's quite frustrating and my kids won't even use them. All three are mounted on opposing walls, in standard boxes, less than 15' apart. One other gripe, the switch style is unlike any other, so they don't match any of the other light switches we have, and for some reason they are only available in white. I wouldn't buy them again."
2,Disappointed this time.,I have used the previous models of this Dimango product for over ten years with no problems. But this item was of poor quality. The wireless switch became intermittent almost immediately. I finally bought a replacement - different model - from another vendor.
3,"Just ""good""","Very basic, simple. Ideal for anyone just starting to read about Christianity. Book was just ""good""."
2,The Art of Simulation Using PSpice,"I have read this book, and found that the first four chapters are good describing the syntax, as well as the basic circuit simulation. Other chapters are fairly easy to understand and worthy for beginers. However, this book do not describe much or provide you a good chapter with examples about CMOS circuits simulation, except 3 pages about CMOS in the appendix G. This book would be great if the author revises and adds some things such as editing symbols, converting subcircuits into symbols..."
2,Not so great,"Not a particularly useful or current description of PSPICE. Orcad puts out a much better reference with their products (easily found online for free). I would love to see a complete PSPICE handbook with clear examples and discussions, but this one isn't quite that."
2,This Book is Getting Old,"If you've read some of Robert Bly's other books on Direct Mail --you've read this one. As for chapters other than on Direct Mail, such as ""Lead Generation on the Internet"", I get the impression that this was written 10 internet years ago. Bly has some good points but you might want to look at his other books in paperback that will be more cost effective."
3,From Back Cover,"She's having a baby!Darby Parker Conrad was the town widow--a sweet, single mother of twin girls. John Sparks was the town sheriff--a former bad boy and her late husband' best friend. And now, three months after one secret night of passion, they were the talk of the town.John was going to be a father!And a husband too, if only Darby would say yes. But the headstrong beauty was convinced he was only asking because she was carrying their baby. And though that might have been true at first, the confirmed bachelor soon realized he was falling for his best friend's widow....[Follow-up to ""The Woman for Dusty Conrad"".]"
1,WAY overrated,"It's about time that the myth about Merrell Fankhauser was exposed for the fraud it is. His career has been a series of mediocre records with little to recommend them. Actually, this one's worse than mediocre; it's downright awful. Bad songs, bad production, and weak imitations of Merseybeat, folk rock, and Roy Orbison. Sorry, but to say that Fapardokly is on the level of the Byrds is pretty laughable.The only worthy effort he ever made was the first Mu album (also available on Sundazed) -- but then, it's a great record mostly because of Jeff Cotton's slide guitar playing, even though Merrell contributes songs. Buy that one and skip overrated crap like this."
3,Less than readable.,The material seems to be spread to thinly. There are alot of great books out there that focus on a particular industry. Therefore they are able to offer much more targeted advice. This book on the other hand jumps around and just briefly touches on subjects that in many cases won't have anything to do with the company you may be forming.
3,Identifies the problems Entrepreneurs face,"A good read if you are thinking about starting a start up but if you are already have an operating start up, then this book will confirm the obstacles you are facing but no major enlightening answers to overcome these obstacles... only a list of resources in the back of the book."
4,Rather beautiful and inspirational,"I have no way of assessing this as a Saharan Travel Tips Guide, but whatever some reviewers may think, there are other pleasures on offer in travel literature; this is a lovely romantic and glimmering armchair trip to the Sahara of fantasy and mirage, and form some might be preferable to extensive information on appropriate tyre sizes. Not all travel books ask us to travel corporeally. Some ask us to use our imaginations. This is one, and it's rich and satisfying at that level."
5,Very Happy,"I am very happy with this product. I saw some complaints about the mouse mode vs pen mode on this, and I wanted to comment that those users apparently did not realize that the mouse and the pen can have different modes set, and the software will recognize which you are using. So, if you are using the pen in pen mode, when you switch to the mouse, it will realize you have switched, and change to mouse mode. You just need to have it set up that way in the control panel. Also, pay close attention to your hand position while drawing, it will make a big difference. I love this pad!"
5,Silver Graphire Tablet,"This is an exceptional tool for me to use with Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. It gives pinpoint accuracy, which is what I need to create my illustrations and enhance my digital imaging. I am 100% satisfied with this product."
4,Very Useful Device,"This has proved to be an excellent purchase. The mouse takes a little while to get used to, as you have to pick it up and move it back into the active area when moving across large areas of screen. But after a while you don't really notice it anymore.I had never used a pen and am still getting used to it, but the additional control it gives me in Photo Shop has been a revelation. There are less expensive tablets, but the software bundle more than makes up for that, even though the software is all one generation old.I STRONGLY RECOMMEND A WRIST REST! I got a small one with no mouse pad about two weeks after I got the tablet, as my wrist was starting to ache.Minor Details:It's nice being able to put a photo in the tablet. Not only does this personalize it, it makes it easier to identify the active area with a glance, unless you use a real big photo.The software called Just Write Office only works if you have Microsoft Office installed."
5,Great,I love usimg this thing. It is so much better then using the mouse. You have alot more control for fine work.
3,Wacom Graphire specification misleading,I like the pen and particularly the mouse. BUT--the adverstisement and specifications omit the fact thatmany of the features are NOT available for users who have Macintosh computers.
3,"Hard to get used to, but still helpful","It's taken me a few weeks to get used to using the tablet to do some image editing. I'm sure I'm not using all of the features to their best and since I use GIMP, I'm pretty sure it's not using them to their most either. But overall, I'd get another one, although larger now that I've used this one."
4,watch the stylus,"The rubber grip of the stylus disintegrated in a few weeks. Then with an unprotected skeleton of a pen, one of the buttons fell out. (It still works, just looks bad.) I have used the same tablet before, though, and it lasted for years, so I would recommend it all over again and buy it again. The tablet is protected by a strong acrylic casing, so the entire surface is smooth."
5,Great for size and price,"The Wacom Graphire4 may be a little small at only 4x5, but it is a great option for those looking for a cheap tablet. I purchased this item partly because of the great programs packaged with it. It is a great option for the casual artist."
4,wish I had gotten a bigger one!,This technically works well. I am finding learning to use it difficult. I really wish I had spent a little more and gotten a bigger one!!!!! It is a lot smaller than I thought it would be and would be alot easier if it was bigger.
4,Awesome Price!,"I couldn't turn down this product for the price that it was being offered at! I recieved it on time and everything works great. I myself wish that I had purchased a tablet slightly bigger to draw on but the product itself, I have no complaints about."
5,AMAZING!!!!,"This tablet is amazing... it is a really good deal for artists ^_^Not only do you get a tablet but you get COREL PAINTER 2 which is an amazing art program, and also PHOTOSHOP ELEMENTS 3!! And another photoeditor program (which I dont really use). It also comes with a wireless mouse... I use the mouse when I'm typing and the pen for casualties or when Im drawing of course.The only thing I was worried abotu when I was ordering it was it's size... I thought it might be too small, but it isn't! It's like PERFECT size. It's nice... it RARELY doesnt make a penstroke when I'm drawing. Like maybe one time a week? And thats only one penstroke."
5,The right size,"On recommendation from a friend, I decided on this small version (thought at first I wanted a larger one) and have found it to be a perfect size. I don't do any drawing with it, just photo editing."
5,yay,"Not sorry I bought it--this thing rocks...see below reviews. The Wacom only comes with PS Essentials, Corel Paint essentials, and some crappy photo editing software. The other 2 office ones that analyze your handwriting [mentioned in the description]are not included."
3,"OK, but not exactly pen on paper","I bought the tablet to write cursive notes for others, but it requires more pressure than what I normally use when writing - especially when writing fast. Also, not using it all the time, it's tough to transition between mouse and tablet. I hadn't used photoshop before, and I do really like the Photoshop Elements software that's included. The product is probably just fine for artistic types."
3,Okkk...,"I do some graphic design work for my employer, and I decided that I would purchase this tablet for home in case I needed to take the work home with me.The tablet that we use at work has a surface that shows your drawing on the tablet itself, so that it is really like you are darwing on a regular piece of paper, in a way. I don't know how to really explain it.With this tablet, you have to follow the cursor on screen, and it is very disorienting. I think it is a good tablet for beginners, but overall, the one at work is a much better model and much easier to use. I will come back and tell you what the other tablet at work's brand/model is once I get back on Monday."
5,Wonderful pan -- holds heat forever!,"I have a set of the Gourmet Distinctions line. My only complaint is that the set came with only two small skillets.So I purchased this saute pan, which is wonderful. It distributes the heat very well across the bottom of the pan. It holds the heat forever because of the thick bottom. And it cleans up great. We use it all the time.My mother-in-law, who just purchased an uber-expensive All Clad set, was impressed with this great pan as well."
3,Induction cooktop warning,"We purchased this pan to complement other cookware that we purchased for use on an induction cooktop, in this case a FAGOR tabletop model that we got to try out induction cooking. It is a handsome piece of cookware, but two family members with acute hearing noticed a high pitched buzz (supersonic dog frequencies)that the pan emits when the stove is active. Cast iron pots do not make this sound. A Sears Kenmore set that we purchased also makes this noise and was returned. I borrowed an ALL CLAD pan to test, and it made the buzzing noise, but to a lesser degree. The problem could be related to inadequate bonding of the metal layers in the base, but I didn't want to saw the pan in half to find out. This could also be particular to some, but not all induction stoves. If the operating frequency of the induction power supply were high enough to be out of human hearing, only our dogs would complain! With a conventional cooktop, these pans should be just fine."
5,AWSOME SCI-FI,"This is a great Sci-Fi movie. It has great caracters, cool space ships, cool costumes, and a great story line. I highly recommend this movie and the rest of the LEXX series. Every show is sexy, funny, with good visuals and great action. Don't miss it...."
5,The best alternative sci-fi for mature audiences,"A long dead androgynous assassin, a security guard, a female love slave, and a robot's head get together inside a huge flying insect. Also there's a cultish universal order with clerics, a female cannibal, revolutionaries wearing miniskirts, and a collection of brains who steal people's memories to share among them... This movie is really a weird must see space trip, is nothing like Star Trek."
4,A MUST have bot not the BEST of the four films,"This episode of Lexx takes us to the abandoned former home world of the Bruhnanji. There is no one on the planet except the holographic remains of a former disgruntled inhabitant, masterfully played by veteran actor Tim Curry.While I found this episode enjoyable and mostly essential to any Lexx collection, because it shows you the prophecies of the time prophet, and you get to see Kai sliced into thin wafers, I just dont think it was as good as ""I worship his Shadow"" and GigaShadow.I give it four stars for being great. I can't give it five stars, because it's just not quite as exciitng as the other films in the series."
4,Its a great movie!,This movie is reminiscent of Star Wars. Supernova is a great movie and should be veiwed if you can find it. It appears on Showtime Extreme alot. The special effects are amazing. This movie is quite bizare though. Its about a giant insect that blows up planets for a security gaurd class-4 on the cluster. His name is Stanley Tweedle. Only he can pilot the lexx because he has the key. This really is a great movie! So watch it if you can find it.
3,Poetman screws the day,"This was the first I saw of the series, and the worst--though seeing it out of order, not having seen the first one, contributed a lot to my total incomprehension of the events and characters. Seeing it again, after seeing I WORSHIP HIS SHADOW helped, but still. The computer animation was nice, but the weirdness prevailed. Tim Curry wasn't star of ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW for nothing! The shower scene with Zev was nice, though."
1,Save your money.,I bought the video based on the reviews. I enjoyed the first volume of this series. This (volume 2) was so horrible I was driven to write this review so that others might save their money. I can not explain the other reviews that liked this video. This video changed the way I will look at other peoples reviews.
1,Warning,"I write this review, not to belittle those who like Lexx, but simply to warn others not to watch what I believe to be one of the worst sci-phi films ever made. I can only imagine what an ""ordinary"", non psi-phi viewer must think of this mess. I don't even know what provoked me to keep watching it - hope that it may change for the better perhaps. Unfortunately though, it didn't. Poor acting, laughable dialogue and a thoroughly ludicrous plot contribute to an absolute shamble of a film. About the only positive thing I can say is that it conjured up a fraction of interest when introducing the idea of the Shadow, but even that enthusiasm was quickly ebbed out by extremely amateur plot handling. I just can't help but wonder how anyone was given financial backing to produce such a sure fire disaster."
4,Good sponge,the main reasons that I purchased this item is conveneience. Quality of product is not bad but kind of boring (more color selection would change this a lot). It is alright.
2,Just OK,"Back when this sponge was only $2, it was a good deal, especially for pushing your cart total over $25 for free shipping. The price is currently almost $5 now, so I wouldn't even consider it unless the price dropped. You can get a pack of 3 at a well known department chain store (BB&B;) for around $6, and quality is either the same or better (not sure if the three-pack is still available). The sponge itself is decent, though I find it rather small.Edit (2/9/13): Holy cow, thirteen bucks for a single loofah?!? Just dropped review by a star (probably too generous). Price gouging by Amazon is getting ridiculous! I recommendAquasentials Mesh Pouf Sponge (4 Pack)if you want to go cheap. Although the Aquasentials unravel easily and aren't super high quality, it's decent for a little more than a buck a piece."
1,Unravelled after two uses,"My use of this sponge lasted for a total of two showers. All seemed nice. But on the third use, I loaded the sponge up with shower gel and the sponge immediately began to unravel into a single piece of crinkled material. Perhaps this specific one was defective but I am certainly not purchasing another one!"
1,"Almost $10 for one??? Yeah, right...",I've bought these before when they were $3 and now they are almost $10. You've gotta be kidding!! Why would someone pay this much for a single sponge?
4,Good product,"This item is very good, except the retractor button does not work every time. But after trying it a time or two, it will usually retract the cord. Amazon did a nice job of getting the item to me quickly, and I appreciate that."
5,Do you want to protect your eyes and being attractive at the same time?,"The product arrived in perfect condition, it was really well packed so the 3000 miles it traveled up to my city did not affect neither the package nor the product. When it arrived (On time), you can enjoy really distinctive sunglasses, they are perfect for outdoor activities, they are very light. You can be sure you will be seen because of the design and colors !!!. Happy with this purchase!!!"
5,Premier Shades!,"I now own 2 pairs of glasses from JimartiPerfect fit and love the style!What a value too, comes with a hard case, soft case, cloth and a few free accessories!You can't beat the price on these! Also get a coupon for a free pair of Aviator's for the cost of shipping!I'll keep buying from these guys!"
4,"Nice Shades,","Protective polaroid lenses provide very good view, over my expectation. Even though the frame looks cheap, I recommend them to who ever cares for eyes. I'm going to buy few more.Jimarti V8 Polarized Sunglasses for Golf, Fishing, Cycling. Some Colors on Closeout."
4,Perfect,I purchased the silver and orange glasses and they are an excellent deal for only $40.00. I use them primarily for running and they don't bounce around at all. When you receive the glasses in the mail you are also given a mesh case and cloth bag. Considering I only paid $40 I got much more than I was expecting. This is an awesome product.
1,Would've been great if I liked the way they looked on me.,"I returned this product because I didn't like the way they looked on me, which is too bad because they arrived quickly, they were a great price and came with a nice leash and very nice case. My refund was processed quickly so I would definitely do business with this vendor again."
5,Great buy!,"Bought these sunglasses for my son for Christmas. Didn't expect them to be in so quickly. My son loves them - recommended item, recommended seller!"
4,Good enough,"I got the Ice Blue and Smoke version. I am happy with the look and quality for $20. I would not have been as happy if I had gotten the $40 version. They fit well. I use them running and playing golf, as well as driving. Good enough."
3,Awesome shades for the price,"Shipping was very quick! I received them and took them out for a run which happened to be a race. During the race I found myself adjusting the glasses often. The shades are a tad small and I've got a big head. So it was tough finding a comfortable fit. The make is nice and solid. Unlike some other shades, when wiping the lenses the lenses don't fall out. That was a big plus. The lenses are not as dark as I'd like them to be. On a very bright day, you could probably see my eyes through the lenses. So I guess that means I can't check out girls while they run past me. Oh well."
4,Nice for Running,"I use these for running and they are great. Nice and snug without being irritating.The fit and finish is just average, but in line with their cost, which is great.Overall a strong recommendation for affordable and functional sunglasses."
2,"Work well, until the screws fall out","These sunglasses are great but after sporadic but very gentle wear, the screws have started to fall out of the frame and so the lenses are actually falling out. I've never had this happen with a pair of sunglasses before."
1,I'll hear it today,O.k already. Am I the only person left on the planet that has not heard Richard Smallwood's lastest c.d.? I have heard enough about it that I am going out today to buy the video and c.d. He was here in Cleveland last weekend and this city will never be the same. You can tell right away if the person to whom you are speaking with was in the church with Mr.Richard Smallwood. They glow. So my heart is fixed and my mind made up. Today I'll see and hear for myself and in a few weeks I'll write my review.
5,Awesome Album,"I love songs based on scriptures. It's amazing how Bro. Smallwood writes his songs. The first two songs I listened to were ""Faith"", and ""Highest Praise"". I thought his last album was good, but he went off the richter scale with this album. This is by far one of the best albums I've heard in a long time (since the Jackson Southernaire's days in the 80's). ""Healing"", ""Come Before His Prescence"", ""Holy Thou Art God"", need I say more. ""You're Not Alone"" blesses my soul everytime I listen to it. I think that VISION is an awesome compliment to his songs. If you don't have this album, get it. I am very picky about the music I listen to, but this album exceededdddddd my expectations. It gives 100% praise to God the Father, and Jesus Christ our Lord. Keep doing what you're doing Bro. Smallwood."
5,The Answer is on the WAY!,"This CD was a great blessing to me, the songs were beautiful and touch my heart.If your going through something. Buy the CD, Trust me The Answer is on The Way.Abel Gonzalez"
5,Awsomely beautiful !!,"Moving, artful --- no words to describe. Worth much more than $15. My personal favorite tracks: Holy Thou Art God, and Feast of the Lord. If you love gospel, you gotta have this CD, in my opinion. If you're curious about gospel, I think this CD might help you understand what the buzz is all about."
5,HE'S DONE IT AGAIN,"PRAISE THE LORD,IT IS A PLEASURE TO TALK ABOUT BROTHER SMALLWOOD AND ALL THAT HAVE ASSISTED IN THE YEARS TO HELP MAKE THE RECORDINGS NOT JUST A MUSICAL TREAT BUT CERTAINLY A SERVICE. I AM FROM NEW YORK CITY AND CURRENTLY SING WITH REV. TIMOTHY WRIGHT & THE CONCERT CHOIR. WE WERE ALL AT A McDONALDS GOSPEL FEST RECENTLY HERE IN MADISON SQUARE GARDEN AND BROTHER SMALLWOOD AND VISION BLESSED US ALL IN THE SONG ""HEALING"" FOR THIS SONG HAD TOUCHED ME IN A SPECIAL AND UNIQUE WAY... KEEP PRAYING FOR OUR BROTHER AND CHOIR AND MINISTRY THAT HE HAS KEPT OVER THE YEARS TO ENCOURAGE GODS PEOPLE."
5,Annointed best describes this project.,"At the very beginning of this CD, I immediately recognized the fact that God has truly annointed this project. Each song is such a blessing and ministers to the heart and soul of all who listen. Just when you think you have heard from heaven, the next one reaches a place in your spirit."
5,History of the Great Reformation of the Sixteenth Cen V II,In the Suggestion Box you entered:Volume 2 of J.H. Merles d' Aubigne book The History of the Reformation in the Sixteenth Century captivates the reader. As an artist the picture is painted of the event and the reader is there. This book written in 1843 gives insights to Martin Luther's life and those of whom he associated. The completion of the book takes the reader to Switzerland and leaves Martin Luther still fighting the battle. I highly recommend this book. Hope to soon read volume three to complete the biography of Martin Luther. P.E. Anderson DMin
5,Beautiful briefcase,Received today and it is great!Beautiful and very expensive looking.Very satisfied.Great people to do business with.
1,Not what I expected.,"I received this yesterday and was very disappointed. It didn't look anything like the bag they showed on the photo. I ordered the brown bag but the one I received looked grayish brown and dull with scratches. This bag is BULKY and HUGE. Beware, the vendor doesn't offer a paid return shipping option, that means you are resposible for shipping back this big bag!!"
4,Business (not tech),"I am a consultant that deals with IT management. After years of carrying around the ubiquitous nylon laptop bag, I decided to get something that reflected my expertise more. I was tired of people thinking that I was a programmer.I bought this briefcase because of the styling and 1940s look. Glad to say it has met my expectations about the impression it makes. I would have given it 5 stars but there was no padding in there for my computer. I improvised with some foam. Works great. Terrific product."
5,"Very well made, good quality and affordable","Purchased this briefcase for my husband as an anniversary gift and he loves it!!!Delivery was right on schedule, actually delivered to my door step a few days earlier than expected... came in a nice brown bag to protect leather during shipping/handling.....the briefcase is a mixture of your traditional and modern/contemporary briefcases, perfect for everyday use, not too big, not too small, perfect size....and it's very reasonable/affordble( got it for $89.99), although it looks wayyyyy more expensive....you cant go wrong with this briefcase."
5,Very handsome case,"I dig it. Feels sturdy, looks sharp. A much more durable construction that anticipated. The interior compartments are pretty spartan, but that's okay for me."
4,hardware is good,"I worried this might be cheaply made because it was so inexpensive. It's not cheap at all. I've had it three years now and used it frequently, but not daily. The hardware is good and the leather is holding up."
2,frayed/limp,Had to return b/c the leather straps that secure the flap are to snug. I could see after just trying it out that the leather straps that secure into the two metal closure points will quickly become frayed/limp and will be very difficult to close.
2,More Essay than Explication,"The title is misleading. This book is an excellent essay about Marx that places his thought in historical context. Beyond that, however, it leaves much to be desired. I found it to be only an historical introduction to Marx that failed to provide any focused overview of his ideas. Aside from the cursory mention of other philosophers and very brief allusions to their ideas, there is little here for anyone hoping for an explication of Marx's philosophy. In short, I found the book light on content and difficult to read. I was very disappointed and chose not to add it to my library. If you are looking for a clear and concise discussion of the philosophy of Marx, this book is not a good investment."
5,new book,I am happy to have ordered this book from this book seller. It came in time and good copy. I had ordered a new book and I got a new book.
4,Feel Like Singing you won't!,This book will not make you happy but then that is not its intention. Its purpose is to deal with difficult and taboo topics which many authors avoid. In an uncertain world it provides its readers with raw material for understanding the stranger aspects of life...a book that makes you think is worth a lot - this is one of them!
3,this game is fun,"This game is great. when you first play it you think, WOW this game is fun! this game can be addictive even though it is not as great As MLB 2K7or MLB '07 the show. There are a lot of great powerups in this game.Very easy to win in season mode.recomended team:pablo sanzechsammy sosaacmend Kahnpedro martenezderek jeter (once you've unlocked him)Alex rodrgezpete wheelerIchiroshawn green (once you've unlocked him as well)this is my team i higly recomend it beacase with this team I NEVER lose.Hope this revew is helpful to whoever reads thisby the way this game will get boring if you play it all the time.Bye"
3,Nice book but a bit disappointed!,"This book is no doubt well researched and written, but I thought it would have better photographs and the book was not as large as I thought it would be. I glanced at it a few time, attempted to read the text, but became disinterested and placed it on my book shelf for later."
1,Pathetic Ramblers,As a long time fan I am amazed that I was unable to listen to the entire album. This album is really bad.
4,Hotter than a pepper sprout.,"For Nancy Sinatra's fifth album, Nancy and her producer Lee Hazlewood decided to make a country record. Instead of just covering some popular country hits, like Ray Charles did on his country albums, they commissioned some top country songwriters to write new songs for Nancy. Then, they went into a Nashville recording studio and taped the songs with some of the top Nashville session musicians. What they ended up with is a pretty fair approximation of a mid-'60s country album. True, Nancy doesn't sound ""Southern"", but the musicians sound authentic, complete with fiddle and steel guitar. The hit song was Nancy & Lee's cover version of Johnny Cash & June Carter's ""Jackson"", but the rest of the songs are enjoyable, too. The CD adds three bonus tracks from 1970, after Nancy stopped having hits. Not bad, though."
4,SOULQUARIAN SHOWS CLASS,"Bilal Oliver's 'First Born Second' gives an impressive show to any would be listener;he has an unusually fine vocal range(strong falsetto,varyingly deep lower voice) that makes for unique listening.He has musical qualities that seem originate from D'angelo and Prince,yet are individual to both these two artists,due to his right of centre,off-the-cuff soul/R'n'b lyrics and multi-layered jazzy soul/hip-hop production.'All that I am','Sometimes','Love it' and 'When will you call' are easily the pure genius that provides the thoughtful,organic texture that feeds the musical soul.If you are not familiar with this artist-just remember the cloud-nine talented vocalist that was a guest on Common's 'Like Water for Chocolate' and Guru's 'Jazzmatazz Vol 3'!"
4,With a Voice Like Fine Wine,"I just saw Bilal perform at S.O.B.'s about a week and a half ago. He gave a great performance and has obviously created a nice following for himself judging from the amount of people that came. I absolutely love this man's voice. His album was definetly slept on. I must even admit when it was passed to me in 2001, I put it on the back burner for a few months. He is working on a new album though so, watch out for that. He is defintely a voice that deserves the utmost recognition. If you ever get a chance, go to one of his shows."
4,Under Estimated Album,"I under estimated this album....I enjoyed almost every cut off of it. Bilal has his own style and doesn't fall under the ""NeoSoul"" umbrella and sound like eveyone else."
2,NOT THAT GREAT,I THINK THERE ARE ONLY 2 SONGS ON THE DISC I LISTEN TO. ITS JUST NOT THAT GREAT AND IVE ONLY ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THE CD TWICE IN THE YEAR AND A HALF IVE OWNED IT. MAYBE BECAUSE HE YELLS TOO MUCH LIKE PRINCE. IT GET ANNOYING.
3,He Needs His Own Sound & Style!!,"If you are expecting a CD overflowing with meaningful lyrics & great music, this may be it!!! If you are expecting another classic 'neosoul' project from an artist out of Philly, this CD will remind you of others!! This CD has interesting music, and Bilal has the need to use the 'N-Word' to get his point across on many songs (a real turn off!!).After hearing the cool D'Angelo influenced 'Soul Sista', I expected more of the same from Bilal.His singing is ok, but his sound is 'too familar' to D'Angelo, Musiq Soulchild, and others.This CD had to grow on me, and if this cat gets his own sound & style, watch out!!!"
4,1st Born Second is hot!,"I don't normally write reviews. Like most people, I'm too busy living life. However, I felt I had to put in a word for this talented young brother. I bought this cd the week it was released and I listen to it daily. Bilal is a creative and talented artist.I read the earlier reviews comparing Bilal to Musiq Soulchild, D'Angelo and every other artist out of Philly. I'm from NYC (Harlem) and we don't give a damn where the music is from - as long as it's tight. Cut the comparisons and just enjoy Bilal on his own merit. The earlier releases - ""Soul Sista"" and ""Love It"" -are nice. The real standouts are ""All That I Am"" with Common, ""Fast Lane"" with Dr. Dre and my current favorite ""You Are"". This is definitely a cd to have in your house and your ride for the rest of the summer. Support new, promising talent and get this cd."
5,The B-O-M-B!!,"I pretty much knew that Bilal's album was gonna be good when I heard songs like Soul Sista and Love It,but man the album was actually better than I anticpated. Bilal style is original and this album is unlike anything out there. His voice is just mellow and very soulful. My favorite songs are......well...it's actually hard to pick a favorite cuz I like all of them.Excellent debut from and up an coming artist. Ths brotha gonna be around for awhile. Pick it up"
3,its okay,"The CD is good he has alot of good tracks on it. But the voice and all the screaming can become overwhelming at times. I don't regret buying the CD, but it is not a CD I would chill to when I have a headache.I love sometimes and reminisece, and all that i am and Sally. There are other good tracks on there. You can tell that he has some training and he is very original and has some good lyrics and feels what he is singing i always give points to someone who wrote there own lyrics it makes the CD more presonal. over all i will give this CD a 3.5. If soulful, jazzy, scat singing, with a sprinkle of Hip Hop is ur thang this is the CD for you."
5,The Un-catagoric Artist,"1st Born Second is indeed a breath of fresh air!. I had the opportunity to see him perform at the South Seaport and I must say that because of his natural ability to bless the air with his sweet melodic voice, I felt compelled to buy his CD IMMEDIATELY!! Now I, for one, know that the urban youth may be too caught up in the ""ice and bling-bling"" side of hip hop, but I knew that it was time for some real down-home music. ""When will you call"" is one of my favorite songs and has truly gotten me through the tough times recently. Even with all of the comparisons that are being made, BILAL holds his own and truly makes his mark, especially in my heart.Please support real music an buy this CD! Peace........"
1,Not impressed.,"There's nothing more that I can say. No doubt, he's talented. Maybe he'll do better the next time around."
4,rolling stone knows...,"i don't know much about bilal, except to say that rolling stone magazine says his cd 1st born second is all the rage for 2001."
3,Not Feelin' It,"The wave of Neo Soul artists bringing artistic merit back into the field of R & B music that had disappeared in the mid 1970s is an astounding gulp of fresh air for a music that had recently devolved into overly-produced POP not far removed from the Motown Assembly Line era (come on everybody, that was what Marvin and Stevie were working against!).So it is refreshing to see that many fine young singers are entering the filed with artistic skills. Bilal is no exception. He is as gifted as any other Neo Soul singer.This said, I have to admit that his strange sound is a little bit too deep for me, something like D'Angelo's Voodoo on overdrive. Whilst I may like it more in the future, I am afraid I have to give this one 3 stars, but this is on artistic merit alone. Perhaps I will like this one more in the future. Only time will tell"
2,...another neo-soul coffin nail...,"...SOUL-SISTA IS OKAY, 'SPECIALLY THE INSTRUMENTAL AND THE NEW ALBUM IS...okay...I JUST AINT FEELIN THIS. IT'S ME; NEO-SOUL IS DOIN ME TO DEATH! ...i'm sure bilal is expressin himself in the real and i mean no disrespect...it takes alot to stand up and be out there like that!! i got his back with that, but i'm jaded, spoiled by the efforts of them like jill, erykah, d'angelo anem...and with maxwell being the last of the heavy-hitters to come out now, the future of the neo-category is lookin bleak!...for ya'll lookin for somethin a bit more distinct and maybe something you're unfamiliar with, let me suggest isaac hayes' 'the best of the polydor years' from the soul essentials series...that's that dirt!"
2,i dont think so,"i dont usually write reviews but seeing as everyone gave this 4 5 stars i had to tell the other side of the storythis cd was recommended to me on amazon so i read the reviews,they all sounded good, everyone is putting him in with jill scott, angie stone, jazzyfatnastees, maxwell so i was like alright...i expected a smooth sounding neo soul album, a few of the songs were just that but not the whole album, and most of it sounded like that generic r&b; stuff. it is not a cd i can play from beginning to endmaybe i just need to listen to it a couple more times to get used to it, considering i spent almost $ on this cd (i am in another country) im just going to make myself like it"
2,it's ok,this Guy has moments from time to time on here but overall the Feeling&Vibe is very Oridnary to me.He has a Interesting Voice but the Music for me on a whole goes nowhere.instead of showing Him as His Own Artist I Feel Like it's D'angelo part 2 at times.He has more COmplexity in His Work than D but overall the feeling&vibe is very much the same.anyway I don't get too excited on a Debut ALbum from many Acts ever so we shall see what the future Holds for Bro Man.
5,Bilal the great!,"This is my first review of any album and I feel that I have picked a very exceptional one to begin my reviewing career. Bilal and his prodiction team have put together a collection of music that will inspire and elevate music lovers from all walks of life. The stand out cut on this album has to be ""ALL THAT I AM"". The music and Bilial's voice got together perfectly, like a hand in a lambskin glove. The Mike City produced ""LOVE IT"" is another shining example of voice and music together in perfect harmony. WHY DOESN'T HOT 97 PLAY THIS SONG? ""SOMETIMES"" produced by The SOULQUARIANS is another standout on a CD filled with standouts. For those contimplating, procrastinate no more, buy this CD; you will not regret the ....Lastly, for those who haven't had the opportunity to see Bilal perform live, you should make plans to see him when he's in your town. He gives an energetic perfomace that's as good as his recordings."
5,A TRUE ARTIST AND GROUNDBREAKING LP,It's very rare that a R&B artist of this magnitude comes along to take a musical artform back to its NATURAL origins and this is exactly what he's done with this MASTERPIECE. I recently had the opportunity to see him perform live at the Essence Music Festival and the funny thing is Jill Scott was performing at the same time and I stuck around to see him because I knew I was about to bare witness to something truly special. Almost like seeing Prince in his very early years. This GIFTED young talent can do it all from sing to songwrite to produce to perform live. Every song is extremely well written and produced. Even the CD cover booklet is extremely well designed. This CD has a timeless sound. The Bar Has Been Officially Rised For The Future Of Neo-Soul and R&B Music. Without Question. The Sky Is The Limit For Bilal. Believe The Hype. A Classic.
2,Not too good even with beautiful Sandra,"I admit it. I bought this one because I think Sandra Bullock is beautiful and she looked nice on the box. I need not have bothered. She is a very minor character with minimal screen time. She does well in her few moments but that is not enough to make this a ""good show"".The story revolves around a Madison Avenue type who thinks he has a divine mission to found a new religion. He sets about hsi task with all of the market research tools at his disposal and manages to fleece his flock of much of their disposable income. Near the end, he begins to see the light and reforms himself.There are a few brief moments of laughter, a few moments of Sandra in briefs but the the redeeming moments are all too brief."
2,A Sandra Bullock Movie that I didn't like,"This movie was a waste of time, weak plot and uninteresting. However, Sandra Bullock was as beautiful as ever. Was not something I would watch again."
5,An A1 product,"I don't have anything negative to say about this product.If your a Rocky and Bullwinkle fan along with their friends,then this product has it all for you."
3,Rocky and Bullwinkle,"The cartoons are just what I remember, uniquely funny and metaphoric but I was disappointed when I didn't hear the Frank Comstock version of the theme song. I purchased the complete series! Wish they would look into offering the complete series with Comstock's theme."
1,WHERE IS SEASON 5 !!!,"Who can we write to to protest the lack of a season five stand alone set ?This is either very sloppy merchandising or a blatent attempt to gouge the very people who support releasing classic animation.I faithfully bought each season when they came out in spite of the long wait between season three and four and the release of incomplete setsas ""Best of"".As much as I like Rocky And BullwinkleI for one will not pay twice for the same material."
1,This Is Simply Wrong,"Like many other, previous reviewers, I have been diligent in purchasing the individual, stand-alone seasons of the show. To discover, just today, that the producers are releasing a complete box set -- without a separate release of the elusive Season 5 -- is wrong. I will keep an eye out for this to eventually occur. However, I will not be one to pay again for items already owned. I will not pay $100.00 simply to avail myself of Season 5.I share in the thoughts of those who have requested boycotting this item."
1,Le Grande Rip-Off,"I wholeheartedly concur with the previous reviewers. I waited patiently, and bought Seasons one through four one at a time - and there is no way I am buying them all again to get Season 5. I want it. If/when it is released separately I will cheerfully buy it. But I will not reward blatant duplicity!"
5,Blame yourselves!!!,"Why give the series one star when you should be giving it to yourselves? Distributors do this all the time, yet you people never learn, can't wait, then kick yourselves afterwards. When the complete series comes out next month, other companies are offering it for under $70.00. It's your own fault! Sell your individual seasons on Amazon Marketplace, use the money to buy this complete set and STOP WHINING!"
2,props for complete. boo for price,"ok so this is a great show and I wanted to buy it for my father, but they screwed up on the price. seasons 1 and 2 sell for 12.99 season 3 drops to 11.99 and season 4 jumps to 14.99 all of witch average out to 13.24. so season 5 the last season should cost between 11.99 and 14.99 all by it self maybe a little more since its the last say 19.99. Well putting it in a set like this without listing it by itself puts the price of season 5 between 47.03 and 99.99 depending on if you if you had seasons 1 - 4 yet. the price for season 5 should be $20 or less and all 5 seasons should be discounted to less than buying them all by themselves ie $65 or so."
2,Next question.....,"I guess this begs the question, will this ever get released on Blu-ray? I have Seasons 1-4, don't think I'd buy the whole series just to get Season 5. I'd shallow hard and do it for my all-time favorite series, The Bob Newhart show, which only has season 1-4 out and nothing in the past few years. But good grief, this is highway robbery if they don't release season 5 as a standalone. Not sure how some of these execs can even sleep at night."
4,Complete Bull review,I got this about two weeks ago. It came quickly since I was a prime member at that time. I have only looked at two shows but all seems fine. I have been too busy to really watch. I got it when it was on sale here YA baby! So the price was low enough to get it great deal and hope amazon offer many more. I do not know if would have bought it at $100. Others have complained about the series.I am happy to have it and it brings back great times of watching this show when I was in my teens. It use to be on every sunday morning where I lived. I have no complaints. I am not to anal about somethings. Package arrived in great condition and it had a good book talking about the show.
5,worth the wait,"I was so happy to see the complete series in one package. The packaging is great, it comes with a Bullwinkle award ribbon that's silly but fun, and a nifty booklet with interesting historical tidbits and lots of archival photos. I've started watching, and am pleased to see that Bullwinkle stands the test of time, as much fun today as when it originally aired. I highly recommend this to any and all Bullwinkle fans."
3,"Bullwinkle and Rocky, what can you say","i bought this set because i was a kid when it was on TV and i remebered liking some of the shows, now after fifty some years i see too much of the show was cheap production, though sometime the dialog was witty. the animation was sloppy and very little continuity, the artist who did the voices were talented indeed but the art work was just to hit and miss. you might enjoy it more if it was listen to like a radio program."
2,No closed captions!!!,"I bought the first season of this great animated series mainly to finally understand the dialogue. Being hearing impaired caused me to not enjoy the show as much as most people. When I began to play the DVD, I realize there were no closed captions!??! This is stupid when several companies do not put closed captions on shows. Anyway, I quickly sold the DVD. There could have been a chance for closed captions to be put on the Box Set; but I see in the product description that there is none.It's a cryin' shame! I won't be spending my money on this!"
4,Rocky and Bullwinkle Never Looked Better !,"I got this as a gift. I was born in 1958, so I only got to see the show on the local UHF station in reruns when I was a kid. There's a lot of great cold-war era humor here, reminiscent of vintage MAD magazine. Great fun, nice packaging, too."
3,Cheesy Release,I think it is quite cheese to release the Rocky & Bullwinkle Complete with extras and not release the Season 5 with the same extras. Those of us who bought the shows by season get screwed and have to buy everything again in the comlete package to get the extras. Talk about scabbing for money.
5,"Well, it works!","I love this DVD. It's a great title because you really do feel great all over after you've finished and you know you are moving forward in your mission. (Mine is to get stronger and more flexible as I get older). I didn't think I could do Pilates - it seemed like it was for meant someone with a more advanced sense of movement and strength, but Tannis makes it clear: work at the your own level and you'll advance. She explains the movements and how to make it a challenge you can handle it. An hour (plus a bit ) goes zipping by. The tape is something I look forward to - I do it 3 times a week. I'm stronger (I understand what I'm doing because she so clearly explains everything - breathing, the inward pucker) you can't help but get better at the technique. And there is a goal to reach for. I'm going to achieve the arc of that mermaid one of these days."
5,Loved it!,"I am a 62 year old woman who has been doing yoga for years. But ""Well Worked Out"" exercised muscles I wasn't using. It is fun, energizing, and feels great. Sometimes I do it in parts over a few days, and sometimes I do the entire workoout (I think it takes about an hour). I highly recommend it."
4,Where today's country came from,"If you want to see where today's country came from, this is required listening. But listening to this CD is not simply an academic exercise. It is also enjoyable to listen to, even today.It is amazing how much influence on music Buck has had. ""Act Naturally"" and ""Save the Last Dance For Me"" were covered by other groups and who can forget his harmonies. Many of these tunes hit the charts when they were new.If you only know Buck from his goofy skits on Hee-Haw you owe it to yourself to listen to these tunes."
5,a fun CD,"When I first bought this one I didn't take it out of the player for two weeks. Even if you don't like what passes for country music nowadays you should give Owens a chance. I challenge anyone not to sing along with Truck Drivin' Man, Act Naturally, or Storm of Love. There really isn't a weak song on it though I think these are the standouts."
2,Not as pictured...,"This is not worth $40. If I found it in a store I would not spend $15 on it. There is another review that talks about the candles, sticks, and cards but this item is just the DVDs CD and lotion. It comes in the box that I would never give as a gift (and I'm a guy). It looks cheap and if I had known what it looks like before purchasing I would have never spent $40. Basically you get the box (that is just like a happy meal box), two DVDs that come in the small packages like in the $9 bend at Wal-Mart, and the CD that you can find for $1 on Amazon. That's it. There are no little yellow cards, no white packaging stuff, no little sticks, and no candles. Now I've got to go back to the store and find something worth giving my wife for V-Day."
3,Not a basket,"The ""happy meal"" box in the background is the basket. I opted to toss the box and make my own basket. Also note that the picture shows six candles and three tea bags/honey sticks, but the item includes three candles and one tea bag/honey stick. My vote is the contents make a great gift idea, presentation is lacking."
3,"Ok, but not the best Nightside book.",I've read all of Simon Green's Nightside books and I've got to say this one was a bit disappointing. After the demolition job Heaven and Hell's major hitter's did there should have been more death and destruction evident imho. There was also a lack of spark in the plot. This book might have been better placed earlier on when John Taylor was just a PI.
2,Full of Cliches,"I wanted to like this book, I really did. I liked the PI angle, but it was hard to root for this self-proclaimed ""bad-ass"" because he seemed too two dimensional. Everyone in the Nightshade fears him because of the horrible things he's done, yet when push comes to shove, he seems more like an average guy with a god complex than someone who is equiped to handle the likes of the Griffin.I almost couldn't finish the novel when I read that Dracula (yes, THAT Dracula) was in the bar & he was a has-been. I'm getting the impression that the Nightshade is full of everything, especially things that have had their copyrights expire...I won't spoil the ending, but it is a big letdown, especially after the church scene. That's it? was all I kept wondering.This was my first peek into the Nightshade, and I'm afraid it will be my last."
4,Welcome back to Nightside,"PI John Taylor has been hired, for ten million pounds, by Jeremiah Griffith to find his missing granddaughter. Griffith is not the most powerful man in Nightside and immortal. He is said to have made a pact with the Devil and as long as his grandchildren don't reach the age of adulthood, he, his wife and children, remain immortal. So why is he now so determined to find his missing granddaughter just days before her 18th birthday. Is he tired of immortality, or does he want to destroy?I'm very happy to have the Angel Wars over and have John Taylor back investigating with his usual humor, strange ""friends,"" and array of powers. Nightside is a fascinating place to visit, but only from the safety of my sofa. Although this entry could stand on its own, it is a series best read in order. I find these books to be delightful escape, although they are not particularly recommended for the weak of stomach."
4,Another venture to Nightside,"Having read all of the other Nightside novels, I was very pleased to see that there was another Nightside novel out after the conclusion of the story arc of the last novel. That being said, this novel seems a little bit adrift compared to some of the other intrigue going on in the other novels. That's the only reason that I would give it a 4 out of 5. It's still a Nightside novels so that means it's still a great read. But I felt that this novel was not as tightly written as some of the past novels where the story line was building to a conclusion of John vs. his mom. Definitely not the starting point for any budding reader but a must for a Nightside fan."
5,great series,"This is one of the best fantasy series of the decade. A delicious, dark wordsmith, Simon Green sets fabulous imagery with great plots and good action."
5,Hell to Pay the nightside novel,"I don't know why I have never heard of Simon Green before, this is thebest book I have read in a long time, such a pleasant surprise like whenLaurel Hamilton first starting writing the Anita Blake series until shewent complete off course and started writing junk, or Anne Rice firstInterview with a Vampire, until she got all holy, I can't wait foranother Nightside Novel, thanks Mr. Green."
2,A fun read...but,"Every review after this loves the book,and I do not fault them. If you like over the top empty mysteries this is a good book. If you like the Garret files, this is only fair. Green likes to write large flashy and in two dimensions. That writing always has the potential to be a fun read, but not a good read. Like the rest of the series this is a fun book. It's no Dresden files, and it could almost make the young reader's section, but it's fun."
4,todo ok,"Todo muy bien y rapido envio,buena calidad y recomendable,buen empaquetado de envio,muy bueno para traslados internacionales.lo unico malo que compre 3 posters y me cobraron el envio de cada uno por igual"
1,Terrible,"hello i was happy with the designs and posters i had choosen, but was very dissapointed in the crease that came right through the middle of all my posters!!! they look extremly tacky and i was very dissapointed in the products i recieved from amazon!"
1,Never got it.,I really needed this poster for the holiday season but I never got it. Because of that along with several other gifts meant to be given for the holiday season I was out a significant amount of money because of my purchases and empty handed!
4,Fast Delivery,"I was pleased with the fast delivery, I ordered the black frame which i think complimented it well, it seems sturdy enough and everyone loves it...love he fact how they combined smaller pics to make up this pic"
1,This Isn't The Switch You Had In Mind!,"If you were thinking that this is the debut album from Switch, a band with a storied career at Motown Records, you are mistaken. The band that is heard here (and their name may well also be ""Switch"") falls somewhere in the seam between Hard Rock and Heavy Metal, based on the info I got from the samples. If funky, falsetto-laden love songs and tight dance grooves are more your speed, The Best Of Switch IS available. If you can't find it by normal searches, look inside my public reviews and you can link up to it there."
1,the worse of carol douglas,"I was very unhappy with this cd,Very bad disco and probably her last.no recommend it!what a shame for a very talented artist ."
3,Great fun EXCEPT FOR ONE THING!,"What a shame! Lots of great fun pieces (mix of classical, with a few pop rag types) played very well by both saxophone and piano perfs, BUT almost all bands have CLAPPING AT END (obviously live performance)which really ruins flow of music. If they had taken the time to cut the clapping, would have rated close to 5, so, if you don't mind the short audience ends on each, you'll enjoy this cd."
3,Just Fair,"I'd rather spend my money on Koko Taylor or Etta James, but the CD is fair. Pretty good sound and half the songs are decent."
1,"This glossary does help, but it could be improved a lot","This glossary contains definitions in English and Spanish, and also a long list of acronyms. It is very useful in that sense. But it also contains some unforgivable mistakes. For example:""Potentially Responsible Party"" is given as ""partido potencialmente responsable"". Any bilingual person realizes the right word is ""parte"". ""Partido"" is a political party.""Aerobic"", as in ""aerobic bacteria"" is given as ""aeróbico"". This word means ""aerobics"". The right word in Spanish is ""aerobio"".""Red blood cells"" is given as ""células rojas de la sangre"". This is perhaps the most serious mistake I found. It should be ""glóbulos rojos"", ""hematíes"" or ""eritrocitos"".This shouldn't happen in a specialized glossary."
5,A Treasure,"I rediscovered John Denver's music just recently. This was one of the first albums I purchased, and I fell in love with it. The inclusion of songs not normally identified with John, such as ""Today"" and ""El Paso"", was inspired.Something special happened on that stage that night. His performances of many of his most familiar songs are extraordinary. I found this recording of ""Whispering Jesse"" to be truly remarkable, transcending any other recorded version I have heard. The first time I played the album was the first time I had ever heard the song, and when it was finished, I had tears in my eyes, and the only word I could get out was ""Wow!"". What a wonderful, melancholy love song. It moves me every time I hear it. For me, this song alone is worth the price of the set.John had really grown into a mature artist.I am disappointed that I never got to see him in concert, but very grateful for concert recordings like this one which capture the magic forever. This album is to be treasured."
2,Not what I ordered,I ordered for the product and edition shown in the image. What I received was an older edition of a larger size. This was not the book I was expecting.
5,cushions are great,good price excelent service they fit the first time with no trimming or having to glue in i will be ordering more in the future
4,"Real women of the American West, not Hollywood!","Each chapter contains a photo and a unique and interesting interview with a real woman of the west, ranchers, cowgirls, young and old alike. Every night, after my own chores were done, I'd read about another woman, who like me, loved hard work, the outdoors, and animals. It was like visiting with a new friend, some I liked more than others, but all of us similar in some way. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and want to read more like it."
5,"Great Product, Awesome Value, Babies love it!!!","As a mother and degreed professional (in chemistry) with a 23 year career in food safety and quality, I can attest to this product being one of if not the best on the market. Baby number 7 in our family (5 of my sisters and 2 of mine) have thrived with no problems on this formula. All are healthy, well adjusted children, the youngest 2 months old. You can't go wrong. Also the value here is the best that I have researched! Thanks to Amazon for free shipping!"
1,No Scrub? Yeah right,"I was looking for a no scrub cleaner so Wouldn't have to get into all the nooks and crannies to get brake dust out. This served no purpose after advertising it did. Even on the smooth surface, after I sprayed it on and let it soak for 45 minutes, when I hosed it off, the amount of grime that was there before was still there. I ran my finger through the grime and it went straight to the aluminum, but I could have did that with a rag and basic cleaning. It says NO SCRUB, so it should work. What a rip off."
1,No...doesn't work like it should,"Wheel cleaner products love to advertise ""simply spray on...rinse off"". This one can't do it at all. First off, the way it sprays on to the wheel...it's more like it squirts on to your wheel. Suds? Barely to none at all. The cleaning solution is so thin it runs off your wheels like water. Lifts dirt? Not at all, in my opinion. I get more dirt off by spraying the water hose directly onto the wheel. Scrubbing with a brush? Yes, it works...however, if you miss a spot, you'll definitely spot it when you hose it off. So you end up having to repeat the process 3-4 times with this product to make sure you get every part of the wheel, which is not the purpose of these wheel cleaners since they are meant for convenience. It's a cheaper priced product than others, but you end up using much more to get a thorough job done, so you don't save any."
1,No better than a sponge,I sprayed and sprayed and sprayed the Eagle One wheel cleaner on my wheels looking for the same results as the other reviewers. No luck. I still had to scrub the wheels with a soapy sponge to get all the dirt and brake dust off. Worthless. Waste of money.
2,"Nice photos, but printed lyrics are often wrong","I think the book has value if you enjoy seeing reproductions of Jimi's lyric writing - stuff in his own hand. I also enjoyed the many nice photos. I am irritated at the poor quality of the printed lyrics - lots of mistakes. Example: Burning of the Midnight Lamp. At one point the printed lyrics say ""About the surface in the wishing well, and a couple lines later the word ""bale"" appears instead of bell. If you look across the page at Jimi's very legible handwritten version you will see ""about the circus in the wishing well"" and also ""someone to toll my bell"" - not bale! My recollection was that Jimi sang the words circus and also bell. There are many other similar mistakes. So I believe the printed lyrics are worthless. I bought a used copy and I am happy with the photos of Jimi and his original lyrics. I'd be upset if I paid full price for the book with all those incorrectly printed lyrics. A revision is in order."
1,Not Very Original,Did not like this book at all. It was not original nor very modern. It was also very thin with little substance.
1,"RIP OFF DON""T BUY FROM THEM",Description says 2/carton with shipping weight of 37 pounds. You would think that means you are getting 2 boxes of detergent. NOT! Only sent 1 box!
5,Great Buy,"The Tide is fresh,not stale dated or old. -Plus you get two boxes. That should last my family a very long time. What better way to recieve the neccessities of life, than to have them delivered directly to your door."
5,Food for your soul!,"If God's words are the ""meat and potatoes"" of life - then Nancy's books (more specifically 'The Fingerprints of God') are the icing on the cake! It would be very easy to devour her books in a single sitting, but I try to slowly savor each heartfelt chapter. Nancy's words touch my soul to the very core, she writes the thoughts I so often have inside. By the end of the book, you will probably feel like you've made a new friend. This book could be used as a daily devotional, but I dare you to sit down and just read one chapter!! When you feel as though God has maybe deserted you, pick up this book and feel renewed that just as He has heard Nancy, He will hear you too."
1,Pretty Bad,"In a world where so many books have been slopped together trying to cover a genre such as horror videos, this one is reallly the worst. A comparison would be the volumes done by Joe Bob Briggs, the CREATURE FEATURE sets, and so on, who don't think that horror films were non-existant before NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Very, very poor homework."
3,A Hit With Some Misses,"Like groups such as Primus or Ween, you'll probably either love or hate this album.HB3 has put together an eccletci mix of tracks here. Many I like (ROM, Another)and some just annoy, esp. Pound for Pound. I am not sure why Amazon likens them to Blackfield or Porcupine Tree, these guys are more Beta Band meets Beastie Boys.They can sound quite raw, and other times quite refined. Listen to the samples first before buying, please! This is not one I can really recommend, you have to decide for yourself."
4,On a Autumn Afternoon,"I was entirely unawae of this disc until very recently. I stumbled upon it on Amazon. I love piano music ..... be it jazz, classical or whatever. Having heard Brad's wonderful interpertation of Nick Drakes 'Time has told me' I thought that this disc might prove to be quite an intriguing foray into the area of reflective/solo pianowork. Well, I was quite right. The music presented here is extremely reflective offering one the possiblity of a bit of a journey into one's inner soul. I can hardly wait to listen to it on an autumn afternoon. Brad's playing and soul searching compares quite favourably with Mingus' 'Improvisations for Piano' , a disc that I save for the most special of moments. You are in good company ..... Brad."
5,"Spiritual, cerebral, peaceful.","I've never listened to Brad Mehldau before. But I'm glad I found out by chance this recording, which reminds me of Chopin, Brahms and Rachmaninoff, but in a jazzy setting. The pianist is quite talented and his solo debut is worthwhile. One of my favorite tracks on this album is Resignation. Moreover, the cover of the album itself has a beautiful scenery and reflects the spirit of the recording. Congratulations, young man!"
2,Grating,"I really enjoyed ""Love Songs"" by Anne Sofie Von Otter and Mehldau, so bought this cd hoping it would be equally likeable. I have been sorely disappointed. Something about it is rather like scraping your nails down a blackboard. It grates. There are a few tuneful moments, but they are fleeting. Overall it tends to sound rather dissonant and off tune. I realise that is largely to do with my lack of appreciation of this form of jazz.I would not recommend this to the casual jazz fan. It's for advanced aficionados who can ""get"" the difficult harmonies. It's not for beginners. I would not compare this to Keith Jarrett. His style is readily accessible to most music lovers. Mehldau's is not."
1,This is poor,"This is really poor CD, Mehldau actually has a very poor touch on the piano and quite a poor general technique. Also, he's a pretty boring improvisor with very few ideas, side from playing up and down the scales with little invention.The review below ,claiming him to be the 'best jazz pianoist ever' is talking nonsense. He's not even a good pianoist.I would like to say more ,unfortunately theres nothing to say about this CD except not to get it.I really don't advise you to buy this or any other mehldau CD'sI took my copy back to the shop."
4,Missing a great intro...,"My only gripe is the missing intro to 'This Town'. I wish they'd have spared us the lame bonus tracks and used the complete version (which of course, is not noted anywhere). A minor quibble I know, but still..."
4,Sinatra's best outing,"This is good stuff from Nancy Sinatra and what fun to listen to. She evokes her mini-skirt clad tough girl in songs like ""I gotta get out this town"" and a sweet sensual side in ""wait till you see him."" Her voice, while not a superior instrument, blends nicely with her 60s pop arrangements, though her Up, Up and Away has a hokeyness to it that seems OK. ""Younger than Springtime"" is sung by her dad. Originally a love ballad from South Pacific, father now sings it adoringly to his most talented child. Be careful though if you've seen the TV special, you won't find ""Sugartown"" on this disc. But easily available on her disc ""The Hit Years."" And that's a good buy, too."
5,"It's A Mad, Mad, Mad Cola","The Soundtrack to Nancy Sinatra's 1967 T.V. Special. The show was sponsored by the Mad, Mad, Mad Cola - RC Cola. This is her best CD. Buy the DVD of the T.V. special - The best retro 60's show - Nancy kicks ass!"
4,Truth is Definitely Stranger than Fiction,"I would have given the book 5 stars except that I had a problem with Horner trying to create intrigue in the first few chapters. I felt it was unnecessary because this has to be one of the most bizarre true crime stories I've ever read. There are still many unanswered questions that I hope one day will be brought to light, but that doesn't detract from the book at all. It was well researched and a satisfyingly complicated and incredible book."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"Save your money for something better written. I bought this book because I read rave amateur reviews of it. But Horner's sentences do not contain whole thoughts; his build-ups lead nowhere. He makes little sense. (for instance he writes ""and then the jury hears something they would remember for a lifetime."" How the hell does he know? They heard it 5 years ago! Has a lifetime passed?) .... What a shame; the Girly Chew case deserved a lot better handling than this. Now, do you want some magnificent true crime writing? Read ""The Only Living Witness"" by Stephen G. Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth--Now THAT is writing. Will someone please send Mark Horner a copy of it? God bless."
3,Hated it.,"I could not even finish this book. It was written in a very confusing manner, and the characters were horrible. The author jumps around from past events to present events and it is difficult to follow."
5,A great story... well told,"The Renaissance is a subject of great interest and curiousity to me. The author provided for me a depth of information, with supporting detail, I found very engaging. I am a docent at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco where we are blessed with an exact copy of the Ghiberti Paradise Doors.. one of just three in the world stuck from molds of the original panels. I learned of this book from a visitor who told me she could not believe her surprise and good fortune to see the doors here after her enjoyment of the book. She was correct. I believe the author provides a very good mix of history, supporting documentation and story telling to move this beyond a flat text book and into a favorite reference for me."
2,A disappointment,"I was hoping for great things- but was disappointed in the text. There are not many history books that I give up on, but this was one- put it down after the first two chapters and haven't picked it back up yet.The major problem- more of a Brunelleschi bio than anything. Even worse, - at least in the first two chapters- every paragraph seems to be a new topic, and not related to the previous. I was really hoping for a nice, easy to read, narrative.Also seemed a little light on facts, but maybe they come later."
5,Love these clogs,I use them at work everyday. They are light and comfy and the holes let your foot breathe. They are also easily cleaned
5,Love Them!,These shoes are awesome. I was standing on my feet for about 6 hours straight and Dr. Scholls definitely helped. The shoes do run small. I wear a 7 1/2 and purchased a 9.
5,Market Spice Tea,"My husband and I were introduced to Market Spice Tea in 1984 while we were living for a few months in Seattle. We loved it and, upon our return to Jamesville, NY, begain to regularly order it. Many of our friends now order it, too. It is an ideal hot drink in the winter and equally good iced in the summer. 23 years and counting it is still our favorite tea!"
5,Nothing else like Market Spice!,"We moved from the Pacific Northwest 11 years ago, but our fondness for Pike Place Market's most famous tea has not diminished. With its orange and cinnamon flavor and distinctive bite, there's nothing quite like it. So naturally sweet it doesn't need anything else.Our order arrived on our doorstep within two days. Definitely worth a try if you are a tea buff!"
5,A wonderful spicy tea,"This is the best tea we have ever had. It has a wonderful, spicy flavor with a hint of citrus."
5,"Good, really good, tea","Market Spice tea is a real favorite in our family. We are so glad we don't have to travel to Seattle to buy it now. The tea is worth the trip, but unless we buy an obscene amount, it makes it very expensive."
3,Not my preference,"This is a quality product obviously well respected as evidenced by the reviews. I knew it was reputed to be strong and with a spiced flavor, but for me the spice comes through but not the tea, I cut it by mixing with a good loose black tea and getting to a balance that more suits my taste."
2,Looking for other flavors....,"My mother is a recent transplant to Seattle and she bought me some Market Spice Tea - Cinnamon Orange. It would be FANTASTIC tea, IF I liked that flavor. Is there anyone that can direct me to a website with their tea flavors? The Cinnamon Orange is DEFINITELY NOT my cup of tea, NO pun intended. Thanks for your help!"
1,Bond's Franchise Guide,"I thought I was getting a book on franchises that was a ratings of franchises. This might as well have been condensed into a 5 page booklet on franchise cost. It did however, contain some good contact numbers for someone who has no idea of where to start their franchise search."
5,Will thrill and excite reader to tears.,"True account of a humble woman of God who simply preached the gospel and trusted God for the results. God moved through those hearing the message, and many amazing miracles were the resulting affect. I've read this bood several times and it still excites me each time."
5,Amazing must read,"This book will challenge you and leave you searching the Word of God for more of His truth on the gifts and ministering of the Holy Spirit. He is the same then , today and tomorrow! I want more of Him. If Scriptures say I can have it I want it!"
4,Daughter of Destiny,I remember my Grandparents listening to her program on the radio and found the book interesting and it brought back memories of my relatives entirely caught up in to the healing that was done by Kathryn.
2,No Table of Content links!!,"i was disappointed that for the price, there weren't any table of content links on the kindle edition. Gotta step it up."
4,"It's good, if you don't mind hearing the same tune over and over again in different ways.","Some people might get sick of that, but I like to hear how the same song can be made different. When I bought this, I thought it was going to be, you know, Major Tom - I didn't realize it was the German version!! It turned out to be really awesome. I was really disappointed at first, but now it's cool because I know all the lyrics in German and English!"
2,Major Tom single,I think the CD itself is fine. However I'm not very please with your website since there was no mention anywhere that the CD was in GERMAN. A language I don't happen to speak. In the future it might be nice to indicate if a product is in another language other than English.
3,Well...,"I'm not sure what to make of this book. I very much like the idea of presenting history in an accessible and funny way and it definitely is a good read.Still, as others mentioned too, I'm not sure about the facts. I think in the first chapter, Mark Steel writes that it was Louis XVI who said ""L'état c'est moi"", when I think it actually was Louis XIV! Please do correct me if I'm wrong, it really confuses me ever since reading this passage in Steel's book. How can an author make such a mistake when he's writing a book about the French Revolution!?That's why I'm giving the book 3 stars - because I'm not sure if what I learned by reading the book is wrong or right! :("
2,No Reason to be Cheerful,"With the formation of the Directory, some greedy self-seekers were empowered. They crushed the Revolution in the Parisian bread riots of 1795 and hi-jacked the process to their own advantage. These pseudo-revolutionaries were thrown out in the 1797 elections and turned to Napoleon to gain by force what they could not have by consent.That is the story of the French Revolution that one expects a man with Mark Steel's background to focus upon instead of the tritely amusing but disappointing confection he has chosen to provide.One looks in vain for a eulogy to Francois-Noel Babeuf, the Editor of Tribun and someone whom the author cannot but recognise as a fellow traveller.Shame on you Mark - was it because you have too many `reasons to be cheerful'?. I think you wrote this for the money and you have spoiled your reputation. How the mighty are fallen."
4,Possibly the best of the trilogy,"I found plenty of emotional depth to enjoy in this effort by Smith. The way Lilith and Gabriel were torn and kept apart resonated with me. Their chemistry is undeniable, and their struggles to compromise and find a way to be together (or to leave each other) are tense, emotional, and realistic. Their inner struggles to thrive despite the pain they have inadvertently caused each other pulls the reader into their lives. Their pain, resentment, and longing are palpable.I found this second chance at love story compelling."
5,Another wonderful romance from Kathryn Smith,"Once again, Ms. Smith has crafted a passionate, intriguing and exciting romance. Rather than focussing on the ton, her story ventures into the gambling houses of Regency England as her hero and heroine, separated years earlier by circumstance, battle each other and their rekindled love. Gabe has his reasons for wanting to end gambling in England, while Lilith is proud of her achievement in building a business all her own, the elite gaming club, Mallory's. Each is haunted by demons from the past, but must learn to put them aside and trust in the other.Well-paced, with lush detail, a tender and tantalising romance, and intriguing plot twists, A Game of Scandal proves Ms. Smith is definitely going places in the world of historical romance fiction."
1,"SuperCash is a bad book, says Altucher","In his blog Altucher confesses this is a bad book and that he is ashamed of it. I read this book a few years ago, and I must concur with the author."
4,there is good information here,"If you are looking for serious and scholarly documentation regarding hell, this isn't the book for you. With that being said...I found this book informative especially from a media based standpoint. Many things that had any reference to hell can be found in here and some unexpected like Saturday Night Live. I think this is a good book for background information on a variety of subjects relating to hell but it is by no means a 100% complete comprehensive culmination of Hell. A agree with a previous reviewer saying that a complete encyclopedia of hell that would make the rest of the reviewers happy would have to contain many volumes and even then would it even be possible to be complete? It is a decent reference for things relating to hell and if you are doing research, like any good research you should not only have one source."
1,"Ridiculously Bad, covered such topics as t-shirts and bubble gum cards but absolutely nothing of real interest.","This book is a perfect example of pop culture bubblegum pap. It deals with such topics as bubblegum cards and t-shirts but either doesn't mention or very, very superficially such things as: Paradise Lost, Dante's Inferno, the Hieararchy of Hell, The Catholic Church's View of, Demons, Demonology, and so on. This book is truly useless and a waste of time. I can understand if the book was written for 1-6 year olds, it might be entertaining and of some interest but for anyone with any intelligence and/or education it is just horribly bad. So, save yourself some time and money and avoid this purchase. Spend the money to buy anything but this book. Avoid at all costs, can produce mindnumbing stupidity in readers."
