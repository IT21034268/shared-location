3,GOod book,"Tells you everything that if you listen to your gut you already know. BUT IT DOES GIVE YOU WAYS TO GET OUT OF THE RELATIONSHIP if you didn't listen to your gut to begin with,.,, So its worth owning"
5,A Truly Amazing Story,"I have been reading Nana in Shojo Beat (manga magazine)religiously, and now that it's finally available as a manga in the U.S., I could no wait to get it! The story is wonderful, two very different girls who complete eachother. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone."
3,Adequate in Japanese: in English?,"I didn't actually read this in English, so I'm not sure how it is in that language. The collected Japanese edition is interesting, but for me (a middle-aged male) the most interesting aspects were language use (moot in a translated version) and asking various younger people I know why they liked the manga. This is very light reading, and Yuzawa does a nice job with characterization. Note that one need be familiar with visual shorthand depections of emotions to fully comprehend some of the action."
3,Affordable but filled with errors,"Although the stories are complete, they are filled with errors. It is distracting when sentences don`t make sense and it takes away from the experience. It is understandable why it was so affordable."
3,MobileReference edition also has at least one error...,"Tales of the Jazz Age: The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, The Diamond As Big As The Ritz, My Last Flappers & more (mobi)I'm sorry to report that there is at least one error in the MobileReference edition of Tales of The Jazz Age in the Jelly-Bean story, and that it mirrors the same error I found in the public domain editions.In the paragraph that begins with, ""In the twilight of one April evening when a soft gray had drifted down...,"" this sentence is truncated: ""His mind was working persistently on a problem that had held his attention for an.""I bought this MobileReference edition based upon the publisher's post and claim of no errors in this thread. It's no big deal (""To err is human....""), but I'll be asking for a refund of my 99 cents."
4,Mixed,"A diamond as big as the Ritz emphasizes Fitzgerald's genius, but other stories left me flat. Overall a good collection of an iconic American's work.The Numbers Game"
5,affordable edition,"Tales of the Jazz Age by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Published by MobileReference (mobi).Kindle edition of Tales of the Jazz Age is superb. It is ""must"" reading for F. Scott Fitzgerald enthusiasts and fans."
1,"Too many typos, even for a free book.","Same review as I left for the free Kindle copy of Flappers and Philosophers: I happen to love this book, and I love F. Scott Fitzgerald even more. So I was appalled at the number of typos in this Kindle book's copy. I understand that this Kindle book is free, but does that mean its final version doesn't deserve to be properly proofread?I was already feeing funny about reading a book like this via Kindle. (My Kindle was a gift, by the way.) I vowed to only buy books that I already owned in hard or soft copy, just out of principle. I bought this book to read on the plane and couldn't even get through its first story without becoming a little bit angry and sad. I finally just gave up and will now delete this from my Kindle ""library"".This convinces me that in being converted to a Kindle book, every ""real"" book is in danger of losing some of its dignity."
1,"AVOID THE ""TIMELESS CLASSICS"" EDITION","Avoid the Timeless Classics edition. It is a mess. Far from being ""carefully formatted"" it is in fact full of typos and odd formatting choices that distract and detract from the enjoyment of Fitzgerald's stories. If you wish to save money just download the free version which is certainly no worse than the awful Timeless Classic edition.If you want a better file try one of the more expensive editions.If anyone at the ""publisher"" (or at Amazon) cares I would appreciate a refund on this ebook or a free download of a better edition."
2,fabric is velour,the fabric boots are shiny velour and the buckle is faux diamonds. These boots were a little much for me; I sent them back.
2,Too much,"I agree with J. Witzel, these boots were a little over the top for my taste. They look better in the picture. I'm gonna send them back"
4,from the Quad Cities USA (mid-coast) along the Mississippi,For historical accuracy Elizabeth Grayson leads the pack. Her storytelling skills are par excellance! Her name on a book guarantees the reader a delightful read. I enjoyed this latest book of hers immensely.
3,Not exactly what I was expecting,"I was hoping for a manual that provided more of a quick reference to both the basic wokings and commands of Linux than an intro to the various apps found within that OS, such as emacs, vi and pico. Knowing how to network, send email and FTP is all good, but those are topics that should be explained in greater detail in a regular IDG book, not skimmed over in a quick-guide."
3,When I received this product!!!!,When I received this game I thought I ordered a Game boy Advance game. That's what the picture said anyway. It came as a CD-ROM. my daughter liked it anyway.
3,Entertaining but not too informative,"The investigators in these episodes tend to seek out ghosts rather than to try to prove or disprove anything. I really don't like that technique. You should always try to make the evidence as credible as possible and not base evidence on ""feelings"" or popular belief."
5,Statistical Methods with SAS Examples,"Great book to show the two main pieces of biostatistical studies; choosing the best statistical design for the clinical study, and how to run data points through SAS software to produce statistical output. Calculations by hand for the statistics are also presented, so the reader can see that the software yields the same answer. Best book I have seen showing explicitly how conduct a clinical research statistical study."
3,OKay text,This is an okay book that has examples of statistical methods in research. It is a good source for learning what methods to use in which situations.
3,average mixer... some good feautures,"the 6 channels are nice and balanced. haven't had trouble with my ipod in the usb port. it's okay for recording but not top notch. overall assessment is it is average quality but a good alternative if you are on a budget. it is very lightweight which is good, i just hope it is durable."
2,The Material is So Low-Quality!!!!,"To be honest, I really like the style and the design of the jeans. Fit quite well and nicely. However, after just TWO times of being washed, the material fell apart, and the jeans look old and over used. Not happy AT ALL!!I give it two stars because of the design."
1,Very Stiff Jeans,These are the most ridiculously stiff jeans I've ever touched. They also shrunk around the thigh (not in length or around waist). I guess if you are looking for durable jeans that won't tear easily - these would be ideal.
3,Nice jeans but should say EXTRA slim jeans,"I bought these for my brother who has slim legs, but the jeans were super slim, however, I had no problem sending them back for a refund. I just recommend ensuring that the person who you buy them for, be it yourself or someone else, that they are really, really thin..."
5,Great quality jeans.,Great jeans!! Quality construction and fit my slim build with just enough room to space. I would highly recommend this product.
3,Not Slim Fit,"I'am a 61 year old male, 5'10"" and 145 lb. I was looking for a pair of jeans that fit a little better for someone slim like me. Most all jeans now are relaxed fit, and the regular fit are still a bit baggy for me. The jeans are very well made with heavy denim. I would be willing to pay extra for a better fit. To me these fit the same as regular fit, which I can get for half the price, so I returned the jeans."
4,accurate fit,"A true short rise pattern with comfortable ratios (waist to hips, leg size, etc.). Measures are accurate, sewing work good. They hold the color and wear well, although I do wish Wrangler had a premium denim to match Levi's Red Tab."
3,Nice jean but too tight in the crotch area,"I returned these. Although the overall quality seemed good, & the jeans fit my skinny legs & small rear-end, they were so tight in the crotch/zipper area that they were too uncomfortable to keep. I gave it 3 ***'s since maybe the problem was my body & not the jeans......So I went to Target & bought 'regular fit' jeans that are a little baggy in the butt & leg, but I can at least breathe !"
3,Good jeans but still will not stay up,These are good jeans but still no jeans will stay up on me. I guess it is because I have no hips and no rear end.
4,You should put one of these in your wardrobe.,"Great Wrangler quality. Denim is thick, rivets are beautiful, and stitching is strong but unobtrusive. Fits to size for me. Only slight quibble is the cut. If you're used to Gap, Levis, Diesel etc, these jeans may feel slightly odd when you pull them on. But once they've melded to your skin, they feel great and look like you're heading off to the ranch. Not for every occasion, but when the time is right............."
2,"Way too stiff, like wearing cardboard","Will buy soft jeans in the future, these jeans feel like they were triple starched at a Cinese laundry, and after repeated washings were still tough to get into.Wrangler Men's Cowboy Cut Slim Fit Jean"
3,Wangler Slim Fit Jeans,"The rise in this pair of jeans was very different than that of all the other Wranglers I have. As a result, I had to take them to a tailor and have them shortened by 1 1/2 inches."
5,Great jeans,"I like the materials, the quality of manufacturing, and was delivered as promised.I like the slim fit because of my work as a hang glider instructor."
1,jeans not right,jeans was wrong size order 32 x 32 got like 28 x 32 but jeans size said 32 x 32 jeans was cheap looking will not order any jeans from amazon again!!!!
5,Good quality,The quality looks great! It just won't fit a skinny old guy with a belly. He really liked them but agreed they would spend too much time in the closet because they weren't quite right.
3,Right but tight,"These jeans are indeed the right size, which is wonderful when you wear a 28x34. The downside is that the legs are super tight. They really mean slim fit! I'm one of the skinniest dudes I know (6' 0"", 145 lbs) and the thighs in these jeans make movement uncomfortable for me. The hips, the butt, the calves etc. are all fine.Don't plan to do any cycling with these jeans. You won't be able to move, and also if you develop cycling muscle from cycling in other jeans, these will get even tighter."
5,Best fit ever,"Haven worn Levi's 501s my whole life, and for the past 30 years or so having a hard time finding ones that fit well, I decided to try Wrangler Cowboy Cut Slim Fit. These are the best jeans I've ever worn. I have a 30 inch waist, but the size 30s were a little snug. So I went with the 31x32 and they fit great. I'd highly recommend these jeans for anyone with a slim/slender body and who hate the saggy seat fit of most other jeans."
4,Almost the best fit,"This is the first time I've purchased Wranglers online. The size is exactly as represented, and the quality of the material can't be beat. My only problem with these is that the cut is not for me. It almost is, and I'll wear them for a long time, I'm sure. I don't know what the difference is between slim fit and regular, I have some regular cut and they seem to be the same. Maybe Wranglers are just not for me."
2,Below par workmanship,"The jeans fit well, but the seam on the right leg drifts to the front instead of the side. If I twist the right leg of the jean so that the seams are paralled to the right leg, I can fell that the fabric has a twist to and it will rotate back out of position by almost 90 degrees. It makes me think that these were rejects purchased from Wrangler, as I have not had this experience before with Wrangler jeans. I'll purchase my next pair in a physical store as opposed to an on line retailer as there was no cost savings."
5,Zaurus15,This item was perfect I bought 2 pairs of these and it was easier and less expensive than going to the store. They fit perfect.
5,Best Fitting Jeans In The World,These Are the only Jeans I Will Wear - Have never bought a women's pair of jeans -Only mens Wrangler .Cowboys & Cowgirls Trick for A Great Look - To put a permeant crease in jeans without Ironing -Fold crease -Wet the legs put under a mattress ( for weight ) let dry a few days & you'll always have this crease even after washing them .Best You Can Buy !
4,Finally found them,"My husband does not wear baggy clothes and he is slim. He likes traditional western cut - these fit the bill. Every other site I looked at either did not have them in stock or did not carry this particular style. Thanks, Amazon."
3,VERY Cowboy,"I was hoping these would be flattering on my husband's skinny frame, but when they say ""Cowboy,"" they mean cowboy. We're from Texas, and these are the same jeans that real cowboys wear. We returned them, not because there was anything wrong with them but because they're too western for an office setting--surprise, surprise!"
4,great jeans,Gave them as a gift but so excited to find the size...very hard to find. I have bought them before and they were perfect.
3,Limited appearance selection,Would have preferred a more washed out look but not to the extent that was offered as a selection. Even though they are pre washed they still look too new. The front pockets are very shallow.
2,stiff and wrinkles abound,"These jeans are very stiff and are so wrinkled after washing that it is even hard to steam iron them enough to wear. They don""t look too bad after concentrated ironing but are still very stiff."
5,Exactly as advertised!,"We ordered 2 pair and they were here in less than 24 hours! After driving all over and searching the mall for this odd size, all we had to do was click! We will definitely order more."
3,Very basic feels cheap,"The cloth is quite rough, The jeans looks and feels cheap. Need to see whether the feel would improve with multiple washes"
3,stiff & rough,"I was unaware that cowboy jeans fit the way they did. They are stiff and rough maybe because farmers or rodeo riders won't wear them out so fast. They fit different then what I thought they would, I just don't care for them"
5,"excellent fit, just what I wanted","After endless trawls through lots of jeans shops with my husband for this particular cut of Wranglers which we first bought when on holiday in Las Vegas, I was amazed to find them on the net, so I treated him to a pair for Xmas, they are a great fit for him with thin hips and legs, but a bigger waist, can't get them anywhere else except Amazon and really pleased with them and the jeans and how quickly they came from overseas. GREAT I'm definitely going to buy more, soon."
4,Great Jeans and Great Selection!,My son is 28x34 size which is very hard to find in stores. Amazon had it and the Wrangler Cowboy Cut fit him perfectly.
4,Good fit,"Very nice jeans. My husband feels best in a 35 waist and they are very hard to find. These fit him very well, color is great and very good quality."
4,Good if a little confusing,"I'm doing a year long beginnng German class at the moment andusing this book. Although it is easy to use and the vocabularyis comprehensive some of the exercises are confusing, particularly as the illustrations don't always give a clearpicture of what is expected of you (a lot of people in the classhave complained about this). It's a good book to use in a classsituation but I think it would be difficult to learn Germanon your own with it. However, it seems to be the main book usedin Australia so it must be the best of its kind."
5,Excellent series,"I first encountered this series when taking German classes through the Goethe Institut in Boston, MA. Other reviewers have noted that this is a difficult book because it's not always clear what is expected. I can certainly see that point of view. I guess this series is best when you've taken at least one in-person course as opposed to trying to teach yourself. That way you get the proper flow and feel. The other piece of advice I would offer is to make sure you buy the course book, the work book, the glossary and the audio tape or CD. This makes for a complete learning package."
2,Review of german workbook,"This book is difficult to use. Necessary basic information is located in the back for some reason, and the print is very small. I would not have chosen this one for the course I am taking."
1,"Not history, but a popularized account.","Written by noted Western author Glenn Shirley in 1957, this book is not up to the standards of his more recent works. Shirley depends extensively on other books, and unfortunately, his book contains a large number of errors. Sure is fun to read, but if you are interested in Judge Parker and the Fort Smith court, read 'Hell on the Border' instead. Leave this one to hollywood...."
2,not history but hagiography,"This book cobbles together accounts from policy makers and the popular press seeking to show that Indian country was a lawless place, with Judge Parker and the federal marshalls as the slim line between law and anarchy. The account utterly ignores the reality in Indian country and works mightily to justify the actions of a man for whom, apparently, the accusation was enough to make you guilty. The book does, however, compile some interesting sources not found elsewhere, including a description of each of the 79 men Judge Parker hanged, the battle between Parker and the Supreme Court which continually reversed Parker, and the statements of some of the Indian defendants on their views of federal justice. The evident desire of the author to celebrate Parker and the court rather than objectively examine his record, however, fatally taints the entire work."
5,Great reading on the history of Ft. Smith and Judge Parker,This is a very easy book to read. Not at all like a history book...but it is! It thoroughly tells the tales of the infamous characters that came through Judge Parker's (the hanging judge) court. It tells of the founding of Ft. Smith and the frustrations Judge Parker had to endure to tame the Indian territory around Ft. Smith utilitizing his marshalls and deputies from the likes of Belle Starr and the Daltons. I recommend it to all interested in the history of the west.
4,Handy camera cover,"I bought this for a trip to Alaska - I knew I was going to be traveling and outdoors a lot and I wanted to make sure that my camera wasn't going to get damaged but that I would be able to get the shots I wanted. This ended up working out fairly well - I only used it on one day and I was glad I had it. I was shooting with a Canon DSLR and a relatively small telephoto lens (55-250mm). This is the smaller size of the storm jackets and it was still a little bit bigger than I would have liked - it was a little bit unwieldy. I also found it a little bit difficult to shoot with the storm jacket on - if I exposed the back of the camera to be able to see shots or change settings, things got a little wet, but it protected the lens and the body well, so I was glad for that. I think this could be designed a bit better, but I don't know of a better alternative, so I would recommend it - I was definitely glad I had it and I got a lot of shots I probably wouldn't have gotten if I hadn't had it."
2,Not impressed,"I read this at the prompting of a friend. However, I'm not that impressed -- it didn't hold up to the literary expectations I had. It isn't horrible -- just a historical novel about the 1920's in Germany and Britain. Hughes did a good job of providing sympathetic portrayals of characters some of whom are so flawed I would call them evil. Honestly, that contributes to why I don't care for the book."
1,Religious life,"I have no idea what the heck you are talking about. I haven't ordered anything from you in a year. Ok so you rejected this the first time I told you because I didn't do it in enough words. So this time I am putting more words in here to help you understand that I have no idea what you are talking about. If anyone ordered anything here then it wasn't me. So now, is this enough words to satisfy the dumb computer program you are using to count words and to reject reviews that don't have enough words? I mean I can go on here for an hour or so. Hey I am tired as it is late but I am not really tired enough to go to bed yet. So once I get enough words on here (oops, almost made a spelling error) then I will probably check to see if I have any other email and then watch some tv.OK? Thanks now and you all have a good day :)"
4,great blues,David Clayton-Thomas is a great artist. I saw his performance here in Kansas with Blood-Sweat & Tears and his new group and they were fantastic. Davis is an icon in the world of music having been performing since the 70's with BST and then out on his own in 80's up to now. I would recommend this cd.
1,Misleading,I ordered not only one copy of this book as it was my daughter's favorite book as a child. Both stated that the books were new. After getting the first and finding a very used copy I ordered another. Neither was new. One had the price $1.00 in permanent ink on the cover and throughout the book it was obvious it well worn. The other's cover edges were smashed and page edges obviously used. Ended up in the hospital and didn't have the time or energy to return the items. Real bummer!!!
4,an exciting and intersting book about spearfishing for shark,This book presents many exciting mini-stories in its chapters. The authorand friends travel to various Australian locales inorder to spearfish for sharks. They hunt mostlynurse sharks with catches of up to 10 feet made byapproaching the shark with an explosive tipped spearand plunging it into the shark. Lots of excitementand an interesting viewpoint which contrasts to todayseco-sensitive attitudes. Worth reading
4,Full steam ahead!,"I've been dying for this book for months, and let me tell you... it lives up to the expectations. It doesn't matter if you want to play a Jules Verne-esque Romantic Fiction romp or a James Blaylock Steam meets Spells dark comedy, this book will help it come true.Essentially, this book makes the assumption that Victorian-era culture, morality, and society would not change much had the technological marvels been possible, and I tend to agree. The setting gives players and GMs a terrific overview of a mis-understood culture that is chock-a-block with gaming possibilities.As an example, my playing group is using this book to re-create the Battle of Rourke's Drift... but the Prussian government has secretly armed the Zulus with advanced weaponry, in order to win an ally in the region. Is it plausible? Probably not. But is it fun? HECK, YEAH!Never mind those ""more-anarchist-than-thou"" cyberpunks or ""more-gothic-than-thou"" Vampire gamers. Pick up GURPS Steampunk. Pick it up NOW. Trust me."
2,Well it’s a backgammon board...,"Well it’s a backgammon board, but that’s about it. For $50 I didn’t expect it to be great, but this is pretty bad. First of all, the way the points are sowed onto the playing surface there is a inch flap that gets caught on the checkers if you slide them from one point to the next. I’m guessing they will eventually begin to pull up after extensive use.The most disappointing part of the board is that the points are positioned off-center. So on one side of the board there is a gap and the other side doesn’t allow the checkers to fit without overlapping onto the next point.As I said, for $50 I didn't expect it to be great, but the fact that the points are off center along with being poorly attached to the playing surface leads me to a 2 star rating."
5,Great backgammon board,"This board is well made, and the included accessories are also well made.I've played backgammon for thirty-five years, and aside from a full-size table board that I once owned, this is the best board I've owned. The pieces are heavy, solid, and uniform. Even the dice and cube are of quality.I would buy again without reservation."
1,Stay Away...,"This product ships in great packaging and it looks good, but the taste... horrible. In fact, there is not much one can do wrong with good fresh crab legs, just steam/boil, and freeze to ship. They added salt to the legs while cooking so much so that it tasted not only bad in my opinion, but my cat did not eat them either.So, save your money, and go to any local store that carries the king crab legs, I bet you they are not worse then the ones I had to throw away."
2,king crab legs,"King Crab, low quality, small legs. Can buy better quality king crab legs at my local supermarket.Would not purchase this product again."
3,Okay,"I found this book to be informative however, for a beginner I have found that Towards The Wiccan Circle by D'Este is simply more straight forward and broken down into a study guide, where I feel like I am actually learning about my origins as a wiccan. Like every web site and book author will continue to repeat YOU MUST do your research and find your way into what works for you. This was one of 4 books I am currently using as part of my research. Good luck!"
4,Good Fundamentals,"This is a good beginner book for those interested in learning some basic philosophy and ethics as well as very basic beginning practice. Details are a bit sketchy, but this book may peak someones interest and get them looking for more."
3,not my cup of tea,If you want a primer on the occult this is a good book.I'm a christian and wanted to know something about the occult and this book seemed like the safEist way to learn about it but the book gave me bad dreams. I got some bad vibes from it. It has some prayers and wicca religious rituals in it and reciting them is a problem for christians. but it is a good read. I don't want to knock someone else's religion. Just not a book for me.
4,You will love it,its a good book liked it alot and i hate alot comes with so much you need to know or to tuch up on very easy light read
3,good book for beginners,a good basic guide book for beginners only - recommended for people looking into paganism
4,Really for Beginners,"Though there are certain things that might sound really strange for the solitary practitioner - such as the taproot - the book is very well put together, starting with more general questions and then going to the matter of the practice itself.It's important however to keep in mind that this is a jumping board, not the only book you'll ever need, whether you are seriously considering the path, or whether you are making research. It's very, very basic, in that sense, often leaving you with the feeling that there should be more to some of the topics."
3,"Sheet very thin, but otherwise OK","I just received this and the t-shirt material is much thinner than I had anticipated...more like a men's undershirt than an actual t-shirt. It was stiff at first too but softened up a bit after a wash. Overall, a good value for $8, but I was still expecting a thicker, softer sheet. Finding a good alternative sheet for the PNP is near impossible!"
4,Fits Pack N Play but is not perfect,"I bought these sheets because the reviews on the Graco sheets were so poor. These sheets are very soft and they fit my Graco PNP. However, they don't fit perfectly but it works just fine. I also takes these sheets with me when I travel since they fit most hotel cribs. That way my baby doesn't have to sleep on scratchy hotel sheets.Buy at least 2 if you use your PNP a lot. That way you have a spare while the other one is in the wash."
2,Still feel unprepared,"I bought this to help my teething baby. Maybe I was naive about how skilled you need to be to learn the techniques, but I don't feel like this book was all that helpful."
2,Didn't LOVE It,Oh wow. This was ... pop culture treacle masquerading as weak spiritualism. I finished reading the book in roughly ten minutes one night while I was in bed. And ouch. That was ten minutes I'll never get back again. The book was sweet but it was a lot like cotton candy. Very sugary but no substance to speak of.
5,Excellent reference useful worldwide,"Wood and Wollenberg provide a most useful guidance for graduate courses in power engineering in Chile. I have been using it regularly as the text book for a course on Economic Operation of Power Systems. The basic concepts are well explained, the mathematics are clear and the power generation matters are well supplemented with the optimization basic concepts. Thus, the book stands on its own as a most useful educational tool. Although deregulation has somehow changed the way power systems operation and control are handled, the book stands strong in providing a coherent understanding of concepts and methods involved. My graduates, working in industry, have found the course (and of course the book) most useful for their careers."
2,Unusable,"The recording is mostly very quiet but is punctuated by settling logs & pops of a shocking volume. The crackling is faint & sometimes far apart, but initially the gentle roar is nice & ""warm."" There are also a couple of hisses & metallic pings.This fire CD is the only one I know of besides Relax with Crackling Fire that has falling logs in it. I like settling logs, but this event happens 20 times in 60 minutes, & twice it is startling--like a pile of books falling on your head. So too for the pops--5 of them sound like the report of a gun.However, the weirdest feature begins around 28:00, when the roar becomes an up-close static. The worst occurs at 39:00, when the grossest burst makes the disc sound defective. The static eventually dies away but not until about 56:00 does it finally disappear. This CD is a very bad choice for anyone who finds sudden noises unnerving."
3,A pretty good book,"This is a good book covering the fundamentals of Transportation Engineering. There are a bunch of typos which irritate a bit, otherwise the book is okay."
4,You don't have to be a Vampire and/or SR to enjoy this book.,"This is one of the most interesting SR books I have have read.It is a bit more violent than the others, but it is an excellent read.You really don't have to be a fan of vampires or SR to truly enjoythis novel. Be patient as you read the intro, but then be prepared for action."
4,Pretty Good but needs a sequel,"I like this book alot. The vampires were not the main focus but rather how an awakened world might deal with them...[T]he good guys were more than easy to spot as where the bad guys. Doctor Wake was cool. I loved the mad scientist thing. I like doctor Pakow who had inner struggles. I do want to know more about Martin de Vries though. How come he got to keep his soul? Or did he? Rachels transformation from stripper to shadowrunner was done excellently. I have read better books but this is not shabby by any means. Also, you may want to read the Dragon Heart trilogy it was even better."
4,The Terminus Experiment: One of the best.,"I thought this book was excellent. It's got all the necessaryelements for a great Shadowrun book: Good characters, good story, andgreat action. And it is Dark. Sometimes very dark. Without spoiling it, things don't always go well for the runners, and certain plot developments actually shocked me. Good to read a shadowrun book where the characters aren't always invincible and bulletproof. Up there next to 2xS and Fade to Black. This is an excellent read for someone with a passion for the darker side of Shadowrun."
1,Truly awful. Don't waste your money.,"This book is truly awful. I suspect that Mr. Bond and Mr. Koke intended to create a spooky technothriller combining the best aspects of Shadowrun and Anne Rice. Instead, the result is a cheesy, predictable mixture of dubious science fiction and B-grade horror- everything from the evil cult of vampires bent on world domination to the ""I'm so EEEE-vil"" mad scientist. It won't even give you an in-depth look at the Shadowrun roleplaying world, because this book often contradicts previous sources and novels. It's really a shame, given the inherent subject matter; this book could have been great. But as it is, it's just so much drivel. Don't waste your money on this book. If you're really looking for a good Shadowrun read, try ""Burning Bright"" by Tom Dowd."
3,Eh?,"I have just ordered this CD so cannot comment on it. However, I do own a number of Haydn sonatas recordings (too many to go into - they've been my favourite for over 25 years.) Simply have to say that the previous reviewer is way off beam. The Gould recordings are (to quote Andras Schiff) ""perverse"" and someone who thinks otherwise has a screw loose. This isn't about only subjective taste (if you like them you like them) but in comparison with modern grand exponents such as (Alfred the Great) Brendel, Schiff, Reisenberg, Cohen, Ax, Richter, and Horowitz and fortepianists such as Schornsheim, Brautigam, Odiaga, Badura-Skoda, Staier, Hoogland, van Oort, Fukuda, Dütschler, Kojima and Ranki (as well as notable others such as Koscis, McCabe, Jando, and Kalish) the playing of Gould is nothing short of ridiculous. A parody of Haydn. Doesn't mean the previous reviewer is wrong about Planes but he sure is about Gould. Steer clear unless, like me, you have Haydn sonatas by all the others first."
3,This is a very relaxing cd with a lot of fantasies,"This is an above average cd that will entertain you. It highlights a lot of GG's greatest hits.On this cd the orchestra was brilliant. The arrangemnts were superb. Everthing seemed to work together in a synergenic way.The only draw back I had for this cd was, I thought they could have included some more of George's big hits.Buy this cd and enjoy!"
3,"Excellent film, bad quality DVD","After reading Doris Lessing's THE GRASS IS SINGING, once again I must feel absolute admiration for Karen Black's acting! Also the film is a good adaptation from the novel. It's just a shame that the so-called DVD is only a bad copy from an even worse VHS copy with no menu or chapters... you just insert the dvd into the player and it starts! Amazing!"
2,Hack Job!,"I wish there had been a customer review of this DVD before I purchased it. I own the VHS version of this movie and was pleased to see there was finally a DVD copy available. I received the DVD and threw it on to watch it. All I can say is, the copy I burned off of the VHS I have has better picture quality and is uncut. This DVD release from Amazon was a waste of my money! Unfortunately no reviews were available when I ordered which was around 2 months ago or maybe more. Do yourself a favor if you're looking to get this DVD...buy the best quality VHS copy you can find and burn it off onto a DVD-R. The picture quality will be just as good and the movie will be unedited."
1,killing heat (1981),"played like a pirated, edited copy....i expected at least an unedited version.....i vaguely recall seing this movie before,and was looking forward to seeing more of what i could recall...."
4,"Good book, especially with the film on Lincoln coming out.","This was an interesting book and gives a surprising picture of Lincoln's struggle to find Generals who were adequate for the military task presented by the Civil War. I am the daughter and granddaughter of Army Generals, but one was a doctor and the other an engineer, so my own notions of wartime leadership are based on their observations, not their actions. Still, it was a surprise to find so many General officers drawn from the fighting arm who were inadequate. One completes the book with a healthy respect for Lincoln, whose abilities were amazing, particularly given his background.The book focuses on command and control, and in 1952 when it was first published, the world of war was not yet as sharply defined for us as it is today. Consequently, at times one is frustrated by the treatment, particularly by the conclusion, which leaves the reader hanging.Lincoln and His Generals"
4,Won't Someone Bring This Classic Back Into Print?,"""Lincoln and His Generals"" is an absolute must for anyone who aspires to a true understanding of the American Civil War and how it was fought, especially from the high command perspective on the Union side. Poring over the orders that passed back and forth between Lincoln and his top commanders, Williams paints a highly opinionated portrait of Lincoln's efforts to find the commander who will at last win the war. Williams' portrait of McClellan is extensive - and unforgiving. How this classic study could have been allowed to pass exclusively into the realm of the used book seller is a mystery to this reviewer."
4,Well Researched and Comprehensive,"Williams notes in the preface of my 1952 edition that it is not about the Generals of the Union, but rather about Lincoln and his problems with the Union military commanders. While much of the text is dry details about this letter or that between Lincoln and his generals, the Williams does interject some bits of interesting facts and educated theories on why Lincoln often acted as he did. This is a well researched book, with most pages having between about 3 footnotes, and it is very helpful in understanding the political climate of the American Civil War."
5,Makes you want to cry.,"I've hiked and traveled this country in recent years. I first traveled through it when a youth (19-1954), awed but not truly understanding what I was seeing. This book, along with Tad Nichols' """"Images of a Lost World"" will drive home the point of what has been lost. It can't be recovered, even if the dam were to come down, or at a minimum, be drained, but these two books will make the argument for ending it and starting some sort of resurrection. If you look at these pictures you will understand the imperative."
1,A bit outdated,"This book contains a lot of pictures and reference that are not applicable in todays karting world. The content is insightful, and with proper care you could glean some information for you current high-tech kart.Overall a total re-write is in order to get the maximum effect."
2,Out of Date,"Although this book gives decent explanations of kart chassis tuning, almost all of its real world examples are hopelessly out of date.Most of the basics in kart tuning theory are sound but a revised edition based on modern technology would be much more useful."
5,"Received a large, interesting piece of driftwood","I'm very pleased with this purchase. This piece was ""Y"" shaped, with the longest dimension 17"". Fairly hefty, sank without any problem. I boiled it about 12 hours, then soaked it for a week, to leach out any tannin; I didn't see much tannin leach out, and now my aquarium water stays quite clear.This, and a medium piece, really fill out my 20-gallon aquarium, and make great decor."
3,well...,"its definitely not as large as it says it is. i would say its barely a foot long. wish it was more like 20"" but it definitely isnt. i got two pieces and they are both very different from each other but both are the same size. i cant even imagine what a medium would look like (that would be super small). if you have anything over a 10 gallon tank you are going to need something a little larger. and its not as red as the picture makes it look like. i would say it has a very very faint tint of red to it."
2,Wont stop leaking tannins and very small,"I've soaked this thing for months and boiled for many hours but it still turns my tank a tea color. Also, the piece i received was barely 9 inches which is tiny."
4,"An excellent text on cognitive development, clear and to the point.","I am a personal growth coach who studied in the areas of biology, biochemistry, physiology and psychology. I am familiar with neuroanatomy and the deeper workings of the brain. I also work one-to-one with clients and do public speaking on a variety of topics. Therefore, it is important for me to have a good understanding of development, especially cognitive development.I have looked at a lot of books in this area and I find this to be one of the best general texts. The material is presented clearly and is easy to understand. While it has meaty concepts, they are delivered in a highly digestible form.If you want to understand how the mind develops over time as a child ages, this is a good anchor book to have in your library. I also recommend the DEVELOPING MIND by Daniel Siegel. This is complimentary to this text and more up to date in many respects. It also brings in more neuroscience and less emphasis on cognition as such."
3,a summer to remember,"I remember the movie in 1984. Unfortunately, the tape does not have closed capitons that could bring good memories of the program shown in 1984."
1,Extremely Over Priced,"This file package contains 2 files for $10.95. Other vendors on this site are selling the same for less than $4.00. Also, you can buy a 12 pack for about $12.00. The files are fantastic, but it doesn't make sense to spend that much on two."
2,Now Obsolete,"Being that XP support is going a way, this software seems like it would be a bit of a waste at this point. I picked it up for a newbie. I tested it and it ran flaky. So, it was never used. Based on the cost, a return wasn't worth bothering over. Looking back, a waste of money."
1,Buyer Beware!,"Although this compilation of oldies reads like it would be great to own, about half of the songs in the set are not the original recordings we remember. As soon as I listened through all the titles I immediately returned the set for a refund. Too bad a ""listen"" for each song was not available prior to buying. What a disappointment!"
4,Blount Does Well with the Material,"Roy Blount, Jr. is an interesting choice to write the short biography of Robert E. Lee for the Penguin Lives series. Historians have had their chance and now it is Blount's and he makes good use of many of their interpretations, in addition to his selective, yet effective, use of primary sources. All the facts are in evidence and the details feel right. The narrative is straight forward and moves at a brisk pace appropriate to the small format of this impressive series of biographies. The usual witty style of the author breaks through on occasion and he lets his best self come out in the appendices, including one on the humour of Lee and Lee's attitude to slavery. A biography of Lee still suffers a little as Lee never seems to come across as colourfully as most of the Civil War leaders but the author does his best to provide his own colour commentary. A quick, interesting read."
2,NOT WHAT I'D HOPED FOR!,"Too much psychoanalysis and too little factual information. Almost 140 years after the Civil War and Blount searchs for personality quirks to define a complex and interesting gentleman, general and leader.I'm disappointed too in the general trend for many historians to ever search and highlight as much negative as they can about our historical figures, especially military leaders.It's easy to second guess and use modern beliefs to define the past. Blount (or anyone else for that matter go lead men in battle for four years) and then write your book."
3,-----Disappointing-----,"I came away from this biography of Robert E. Lee feeling that the author didn't like his subject very much. It was almost like he wanted to prove that General Lee was just another man with more than his share of faults. He kept trying to pick Lee's personality apart and gave meaning to every gesture and casual comment that Lee had ever made. I felt that the historic facts in this book seemed accurate as far as I could remember from other things that I had read, but I also felt that there was not enough information given to substantiate some of the negative comments. He painted Lee as somewhat of a flirt, ignoring his wife, and being a cold and indifferent father to his children.If you want to read about General Lee, there are better biographies available."
3,Nothing Great,"I know little more about Robert E. Lee now than I did before reading this book. Unlike the other Penguin Lives I've read, this one does not fit much significant information into a compact book."
1,Blount sure is a witty guy!!,"A nice little overview of Lee's life is marred by Blount's incessant, cynical wit. The tone of the book is basically ""Hey everybody, check out this guy Lee - what a square he is!! And these people in the 19th century - weren't they silly?!?""If that kind of history appeals to you, then go for it."
5,nice mic,Sound better than my other Radio Shack mic which costed me the same price. This mic sounds even better (less distortion) when I use the XLR cable instead of the one that came with it (XLR on one end and 1/4in on the other end).
3,"Not a great mic,but worth the price","Its a cheap mic and you get what you pay for. It a crappy vocal mic, but if ur using it in a studio like i was it can be somewhat useful. Works good for micing a drum and with some decent EQ, its not terrible. In terms of using it as a vocal mic, I had some problems. First its very sensitive to any type of sudden movements. If you don't hold it tightly, you will get loud booms any time u move. Overalll, you can make up for the sub par quality by using it in combination with their high quality mics."
5,Good Buy,"Good buy for the price. Unless you need something special, this lower-priced item should fit most needs."
2,Strange noise,"do not know why this microphone goes crasy from time to time. that is, when you plug in it to the jack of pc, and use skype, the other side would hear some music! really amazing...and i am sure it should not be the problem of skype, since when i use other softeware to record my voice, the same happens. it is really a strange problem and quite annoying...you cannot really tell when it will go crazy like this. if it works normally, it is good."
1,Shipping too slow to use,"I wouldn't know how this product works, because Amazon shipped it too slow in order to ""teach me a lesson"" regarding free shipping option. You see, Amazon simply sits on items that qualify for free shipping to ensure that the ""6 - 10 day"" delivery window is properly met, such that they strongly steer you toward the pay shipping choice. Since they have a shipping hub in TN, there's no reason in the world why my item shouldn't arrive in Ohio, even with slow mail service, in like 3 days; except that they just don't let it leave the warehouse. So, I had to borrow a MIC to support my needs. I give it one STAR since the borrowed MIC was a ""SHURE"" brand and worked as expected."
1,Didn't work,"After several hours installing it on my boat, I took it out for a test run. It did not accurately give me a depth reading. I had to return it to manufacturer for replacement. Good customer service at manufacturer."
1,DONT DO EEET,please please dont buy this stupid mother ***** piece of **** my friend bought this sword and let his cousin swing it around. the first swing his cousin did was a straight down hacking attack he stopped half way through the swing and the handle broke the rat tail tang bent and the sword fell apart!! do yourself a favor and stay away!!!
4,People aren't giving enough credit to the good sword,"Its a pretty sterdy sword, and for it price it good, but i got mine with scracths and could other things, probley smithing, but its good for price, id recommend it. 4/5 stars, (it'd be 3.5 if half was a option"
3,For Display Purposes only.,"While I do not own this sword, I do have to make a comment on it. This sword is clearly for display purposes only as a sword the proportions of Cloud's Sword in the video game and movie clearly are unwieldly and could never be used for anything but display purposes. The question I raise is why didn't they make it more to its true dimensions in the game/movie. It would be much harder to swing around a 5-6 foot long 1 foot thick blade, and would also be more true to the original. So you'd have less people breaking it by trying to use it and it would look much cooler as a display piece... I imagine it would be much more expensive, but I'm sure avid fans would buy it.Haha course I can see people now trying to swing it around and hurting themselves, but at least it would be comical."
4,Buster Sword,"This Buster Sword replica is awsome. The blade is wide and sturdy. Im not sure about the amount of tang this thing has but it is very well built. The handle is curved a little instead of the flat handle that the game's sword had, but this is an awsome sword and I would recommend it to fans of FF7 and sword collectors."
2,For display not fighting.,"For those thinking of buying this sword just let me tell you this is for decoration only not fighting, you can swing it but not hard, thats the fisrt thing i did when i got it and the handle bent, this sword is a good replica but ""ONLY FOR DISPLAY""."
5,Very insightful and at times hilarious,Very interesting documentary I bought one for my friend after watching it. We all know women cheat and they all do it for different reason but this kind of puts things into perspective. Very funny at times.
3,Works Well!,"The actual product itself looks to be nothing more than the stuff you can buy for your kitchen drawers or shelves to keep stuff from sliding around. The listed price on here is WAY out of line; other locations sell it for a much more reasonable price. It does work though, my futon mattress used to slide off the metal frame all the time. With the ""Magic Grip Brown Gripper"" it stays in place (even with a 60 lb dog jumping off and onto it!)"
3,Pretty tame drama/mystery,"Not bad in some ways, but people looking for tension-filled horror are better off looking elsewhere. This is a pretty tame drama/mystery... true, it doesn't bill itself as a horror, but there are definite elements of it in the storyline. How can one NOT think of scary thriller potential when contemplating a theme of reincarnation ? But you won't find it here (at least IMHO). Pretty good acting though."
2,Could have used a better editor,"Let's get one thing straight here people. The boy was not naked in the tub. Of course you saw him take off his clothes, but you never saw anything above the knees. He was wearing a bathing suit I'm sure. Child Services people are present at EVERY film where there are minors involved. End of that subject.This could have been a great movie if the boy had been just a little bit older. Even 18 would have done the trick. What point was it to have a 10 year old in that situation? The acting was great, but the whole premise was totally lost in the cradle and highchair robbing being done by the character of Nicole Kidman.Run away together? In 11 years you'll be 21? Give me a break!I gave this movie two stars only because the other actors has the guts to show up."
2,Facinating yet disappointing.,"Very interesting situations: ""reincarnated"" boy, the mistress, the jealous finace etc.The above story lines with potentially explosive results instead ends with a whimper and leaves too many loose ends.Other than the fact that Nicole Kidman is stunning on the screen, the movie is ultimately disappointing."
2,Promises much but delivers little,"A potentially fascinating plot - exploring the possibilities of reincarnation, is largely wasted by flat and painfully slow delivery.Even the usually dependable Ms Kidman just looks like she's going through the motions here, and the legendary Lauren Bacall is utterly wasted.A couple of inspired moments - the growing jealousy of Kidman's fiancee and, of course, the famous bath scene with the creepy Cameron Bright (does the poor lad /always/ play such roles?), raise the interest momentarily and just about save this from being a lone-star movie but, believe me, you will feel totally cheated by the (non-)ending.An opportunity wasted."
2,Very strange,"This movie just felt wrong from the beginning. The subject matter is disturbing, but that isn't even why I disliked it. It was just all very odd. The plot, the character portrayals. Its a very pointless film and really not what it seems or what it pretends to be. It wasn't a confusing film, but at the end, I was left scratching my head. It was a waste of time and a waste of talent."
3,Beautiful film...but very boring,"Genre: Drama/ThrillerGenre Grade: C-Final Grade: C+This movie only saved itself in my book because of Nicole Kidman's wonderful performance and the amazing cinematography and soundtrack. The story itself was weak, uninspired, pointless, and did nothing to entertain the audience. It seemed as though the director made this movie for his own enjoyment and didn't care that it might put the audience to sleep. It's sad because this movie had such potential...if only it had an ending.Snaps to Nicole Kidman, Alexander Desplat (for the music), and Harris Savides (for the cinematography), but that's all the credit I can give, this movie sucked other than those things."
3,Could someone please explain this to me.,"I really liked the movie, but then at the end I got confused.So was the boy Shawn or if not who?I really want to understand this movie."
2,Birth? More like abortion...,"I cannot remember the last time I saw a film that began so spectacularly well only to so miserably blow it in the end. The first half of the film is like an Anton Chekhov ghost story by way of Stanley Kubrick - creepy, haunting, gorgeous, mysterious, transgressive - and then at some point it suddenly careers off a cliff. I was waiting for it to go south all along (so many films disappoint) but it kept getting better and better and my hopes kept lifting. When it began to get bad, it wasn't even in the typical Hollywood ways that I had expected. It was worse. The air went out of it, the suspense drained away - it was a movie that needed to remain at least partially ambiguous, to be allowed to be allegorical. Instead, the filmmakers tried to finally ground it in reality and ended up killing it off."
1,"""Birth"" of what?","This movie doesn't even deserve a 1 star rating! Can't we have something like a --100,000,000? I have to say this is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life to the extend that it has no real plot, no real acting, and no real substance at all. This has to be one of those ""art"" movies that no one understands, not even those deep intellectual spiritualists that prolificates on the profoundness of the spiritual world. The subject matter has been handled much better by others who at least had a plot in mind before they took pen in hand or stepped behind or in front of a camera. Don't waste your time or your money unless you want to sit in a theatre and eat popcorn and drink a coke and relish the dim lights."
1,Such a disappointment,"I agree with an earlier reviewer that with such interesting subject matter, they really did a laim job with this movie. not only are there parts of the plot that just dont make sense, but the whole movie drags along like a rake through honey. some of the scene changes are so awkward that it takes you a few moments to figure out what might be going on. The only reason I rented this movie was because it sounded interesting, and Kidman was in it. I think the director knew this. this movie would have been nothing without her name. rent it if you must, but dont buy it. save your money."
1,The Absolute Worst,"This is positively one of the absolute worst films I've ever watched. Hard to imagine that anyone could take a subject as interesting and provacative as reincarnation and manage to turn out a film as excruciatingly boring and tedious as this one.A major bowser, folks. Don't waste your time."
1,A Ridiculous Film..,"Hollywood has gone nuts. If you don't believe it, look at this movie. I mean really look hard with an intelligent, discerning eye. Then when the credits roll, you'll say ""What???""The premise of this film is that a ten year old boy claims to be the reincarnated husband of a widow. (And does it badly by the way.) That's it. There is nothing else. No ending, no logic, nothing. The two hour running time of this film is full of bad filler. Even bringing Lauren Bacall and Anne Heche into this cinematic disaster does nothing for it. It is ridiculous. Save your money."
4,HMMMM....,"This is a weak four stars...just could not see giving this one a lower score....I understood the plot of the film, was interested in what it had to say, and what it was about for the most part. I have to agree with some other reviewers and say that there was a lot of silence in the film, but the music that played in the background was awesome!!I think that both main actors, Cameron Bright, and Nicole Kidman did a great job in working with the script.A little weird, but when you are working with type of material, what is to be expected?Worst part of the film...the ending!!! Kinda left you hanging!!"
1,It's perfectly ok to bathe with a ten year old boy...?,"Hello, child protective services?The last time I saw or read about an adult taking a bath with a 10 year old, that person ended up getting 25 years for Child Sexual Abuse. That scene alone should have been enough to assure that this film never saw the light of day. In a time when we are seeing an terrifing increase in crimes against children, it is irresponsible and downright criminal to allow something like that to be shown in a motion picture.I am only thankful that I did not waste any money to see this picture."
1,What crap,"I watched this because of the controversial hype it got. Birth is a slow, boring movie. The producers should've hired a lighting director, because the movie needs one."
1,This Left eye doesn't see ghosts,"One of the most boring 90 minutes of my life-sitting throught this movie. If you have any intelligence at all--you'll have the plot figured out within the first fifteen minutes. Lots of filler--such as the scene focused on Nicoles face for about a minute with nothing happening--other than some uninspired background music droning. While not a prude--I found the scenes of Nicole and a ten year old boy naked in a bathtub together to be in very poor taste and simply an excuse for some cheap pedophile thrills--I'm sure if it were an adult male with a pre-teen female--there would have been more objections.If you want to see a good movie about reincarnation--though a bit of a comedy-I recommend ""My Left eye sees Ghosts""--a far superior movie to this boring waste. In advance--I know everyone who disagrees with my evaluation will say it wasn't helpful. So be it--at least it's honest!"
1,what next,does nicole kidman ever do anything other than crappy movies?her script choices and sometimes even her acting are disgraceful. the bathtub scene in this movie was unnecessary and in poor taste.
3,Witness without the punch,"A mood film like ""Witness"" from 1985. Concerning itself with more unspoken and unshown emotions, this film grandly protrays a woman and a boy both ""frozen"" by either loss or longing. The husband character arcs with expected patience, anger, and then a snap. The actions are not realistic but they are not meant to be so. At times I wished more information to validate the lonley tones of this film and earlier I commented that there was a need for flashbacks or some other device to explain at least the boy'smotivations for his actions. That being said, the music and atmosphere are rich and thus gives the film a real heaviness that does in fact create bouyancy for the whole. Sad, effective, but distant. A neat failure."
3,what a copout to a good movie,I ENJOYED THIS FILM TILL IT GOT TO THE ENDING WHAT A COPOUT THE ENDING WAS A JOKE.IF U GOING TO DO A MOVIE WITH A SERIOUS SUBJECT MATTER THEN A LEAST HAVE THE CONVICTION TO STAY ON COURSE .BUT DIRECTOR MUST HAVE GOTTEN A AFRAID SO HE PUT ON COOKIE CUTTER ENDING.NICOLE KIDMAN WAS GREAT MINUS THE FACT THAT HER FACE NEVER MOVE(MEMO TO NICOLE LAYOFF THE BOTOX TELL THIS TO ANNA HECHE)THE LITTLE BOY IN THIS MOVIE WAS CREEP IN A GOOD WAY .THIS MOVIE SUPERSLOW BUT SHORT GOOD THING.
1,Pretentious nonsense,"From it's over-long opening shot, this film punishes the viewer with dreadful, cliche ridden dialogue and the kind of heavy, doom-laden score which makes one wonder whether Nicole Kidman is being stalked by the orchestra. One noteworthy feature is Kidman's foot stamping, spoiled child performance, which culminates in a toddler-esque rant to the fiance she abandoned about how nothing is her fault. However, as this happens towards the end of the film, I suspect few will be awake to see it. Conceited drivel - it is telling that the only ""quote"" from a review they could find for DVD cover was from the Christian Science Monitor."
4,Birth has a lot of life!,"This film is amazing. It's one of those films that I've had on my list to watch but just had not gotten around to it for one reason or the other. Shame on me! This film was mesmerizing. I was hooked from beginning to end. Nicole Kidman was hypnotic as Anna. I am such a huge fan. I feel that she is one of the best actresses in movies today. I love the choices she makes. I love how emotions play across her translucent face. There is a shot of Anna at the opera, no dialogue just music, that locks on her face as she makes you believe in her reality. What a marvelous choice by the director. What a shot! Cameron Bright as Sean is also great. He made me believe. The whole movie was so beautifully atmospheric. The gorgeous score was haunting. I just cannot say enough good things about this movie. If you love movies you owe it to yourself to see this."
2,Creepy Show!,"This is a very creepy movie. Does love extend from beyond the grave? I imagine that this was the question the movie tried to pose, and to answer, and the answer seems to be yes, whether or not reincarnation is a possibility. But there is an incredible sadness that overwhelms Anna, and it is not clear if this is because of her love for her dead husband, or in spite of it.As Anna, Nicole Kidman is as beautiful as ever she was, a down-under version of Isabella Rosselini, and while the movie is a downer, watching her certainly isn't. This is no ""Sixth Sense"" but Nicole Kidman makes the film watchable."
1,ONE OF THE STUPIDEST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN!!,"I have had this movie on my ""must see"" list for a couple of years now. Due to a recent snowstorm, I finally had my chance to sit down and watch it. What a HUGE waste of my time.The music was irritating...the photography was irritating...the stupidity of every adult involved in the movie was irritating...and the dialogue was excruciating!!!This was an absolutely pointless movie!!I believe that the people who will enjoy this film are the type of people who go to an art museum and see a white canvas with a little black dot in the middle...and consider it to be ingenious!!!Don't waste your time or your money on this one!!"
2,AFTERBIRTH,"Soon to be married widow falls for a 10 year old boy who claims to be the reincarnation of her deceased husband. Nicole Kidman, looking and behaving a lot like Ellen Burstyn in ""The Exorcist"", and the kid, pudgy Cameron Bright, are cinema's newest odd couple and given the strange sexual direction this film begins to take, I'm only thankful the two of them didn't end up in a cheap downtown hotel. Whew, darn close though! Loaded with bold symbolism of the concept of birth, the film fights itself, offering a logical if implausible explanation, but holding tightly to a supernatural element that never materializes. Lauren Bacall, looking as always like she'd kill for a cigarette, plays Kidman's gruff mom, and Danny Huston manages an effective jealous rage towards his ten year old rival. It's said to be the kind of movie that causes after-viewing discussion and we agree, because we're wondering if it's not symbolic of Kidman's marriage to Tom Cruise."
3,Too clever for its own good,"Nicole Kidman takes on yet another look in this overly-clever but moderately entertaining film. Nicole Kidman's character isn't as glamorous as in other roles, which allows viewer to appreciate what an extraordinary actress she is. Her husband, the love of her life, dies in the first scene, and 10 years later a 10 year old boy inexplicably appears claiming to be the reincarnation of her husband. To complicate matters, Kidman's character is about to marry another man, who has pursued her for years but been put off because she's never gotten over her first husband. The film takes the story line and explores it in depth; it's sometimes insightful and sometimes unintentionally humorous. The performances are credible even if the story isn't. There's a clever twist at the end which attempts to tie up all the loose ends--and there's lots of them-- but is probably too clever for its own good."
1,wow! (not a good wow),"I was so syked to see this movie when it came out in theaters. But, half way into it, I regretted it. The storyline is awesome though. But the movie itself is SOOO drawn out. Once you think it'll get better, it switches the story to something really dumb. At the end of the movie, I just sat there thinking, what in the heck. And like one reviewer said earlier ""Why did I just waste 2 hours of my life watching this"". And I agree with that. This movie had such potential, and it got flushed down the toilet. Watch the previews of this movie... it's more interesting than this movie experience."
1,BIRTH IS A NOT WORTH THE TIME WATCHING IT!!!!!!!!,"I had high hopes for this movie,but Nicole could have did another movie instead of this one!!!!!!! The movie is boring and it was such a waste of my time and if i was your guys i would stay far away from this movie!!!!!! If you guys and girls are in the video store then please stay away from this movie it is not worth your time or your money!!!!!!"
3,Pace it...,"Nicole Kidman stars in a controversial film that takes a few chances. Kidman's acting is solid and believable.The story ventures off somewhat, but what we are attracted to is the slow and deliberate pacing of the film. There are moments where you fee like you're watching this movie in slow motion.I liked this film for being the anti-Hollywood commercial film...there isn't any built up drama or tension and we don't get a climax either.The only thing missing is that I wished it was shot at the famous Dakota building in New York City (it could haved and should haved because of the proximity of Central Park)...it would have added another dimension of spookiness."
4,birth review by a cheesehead,"i loved this film. it makes you think and ask or want to ask questions afterwards. my suggestion is to see it at least 2 or possibly, 3 times. you'll pick up key things that you might have missed the first time around - and i did. a few things seemed a reach. for instance: this kid's REAL name is sean and it turns out that was the name of nicole's husband. sean is not a common name. now this is if you believe the kid's story to begin with."
5,Masterpiece,"I read the so-so reviews prior to watching Birth: Did I watch the same film?The acting was superb. The musical score brooding, perfectly capturing the magical what-if theme of the movie. Can the soul of a grown man be reborn to marry his widow? This one-liner raises hackles. In the city-world of New York, can a souls rebirth occur, or are we so jaded we cannot even entertain such a notion. The age of miracles has past. Hasn't it?This is the fundamental dilemma facing the movies characters . . . each in a distinct way. From the opening frame of death and birth, I was mesmerized. How often does a movie make us ask the big questions: where is our soul? What happens after death? The fact that these questions are not answered(only hinted at) adds to the wonderful mystery of Birth."
1,I had high hopes for this film.,"Needless to say, I was sorely disappointed. I like the idea of Anna's dead husband returning as another person, but didn't enjoy him as a 10 year old boy.The bath tub scene really weirded me out. Nicole Kidman's character toed the line and never really does anything outright sexual with ""Sean,"" but it was close enough to make me very uncomfortable.The whole movie was totally unbelievable because there was never any explanation why Sean knew so much about the dead Sean and Anna's life together. How did he know they had sex on the green couch? I mean, the characters were ridiculously stupid not to wonder how in the heck this 10 year old stranger knew the intimate details of Anna's life with Sean. And they really didn't seem to care all that much either. It is just not how normal people would react to such a bizarre situation.Very disappointing because it had so much potential."
1,This was trash!!! Utter and vile trash!!,"This was the dumbest most preposterous piece of crap I have seen in a while!!! The writer and director should be strung up by their toes for creating such drivel. I had the horrendous experience of watching this cinematic blunder during another one of my late night insomnia episodes. To get to the point, this movie waa a ""hot mess"" gone wild. The actors were delivering their lines like they only had an hour of sleep, the dialogue between the characters was simplistic and uneventful and the ending concluded horribly. Moreover, they could have kept that bath tub scene with Nicole Kidman and the little boy to themselves. That mess gave me the creeps and it really was uncalled for. To sum up, this movie was a hot searing ""volcanic ash"" of a mess. Avoid this mess as if it was an STD!!"
1,Just plain bizarre,"Judging by the very divided reviews, there is a wide range of opinion on this movie. For myself, I couldn't get through all of it. I just found it too bizarre for my taste. I caught it one evening on the IFC channel, but didn't bother watching all of it."
2,Too Slow Even for a Melodrama,"Birth has a thought-provoking story, beautiful setting, superb acting, an unnerving scene and a lush score. It lacks, however, fluency and vigor, both of which are essential to any satisfactory moviegoing experience. I understand it's a melodrama, but it crawled even by melodrama standards. There are way too many long pauses that don't really serve any purpose or convey anything. Nicole Kidman never looked better, in my opinion, and that alone was worth sitting through this film. I would wait till it comes out on DVD and I would only rent it!"
1,What a waste!!,"I am sorry but if anyone actually enjoyed this movie then they are sick people. The fact that Anna (played by Nicole Kidman) let a 10 year old boy get naked and share a bath with her is disgusting!!! Also that she planned to run away with him is just sick. There is nothing to appreciate about this movie. If you are offended by these things, then this movie is not for you.If I could rate it less than 1 star I would."
1,One of the worst movies ever,"This was one of the worst movies EVER. It had so much potential and just failed. It was way unbelievable. A ten year old boy that is really a 40 year old man, yet he acts ten through the whole movie. The ending is dismal. The movie claims "" a man reincarnated as a ten year old boy"" but, this is NEVER made known in the movie!I wouldn't pay five cents for it even if Nicole did a nude seen. It is rated ""R"" for unknown reasons. there is no foul language, no violence and only a cloudy nude butt."
1,"Pretentious,senseless,faux-artsy rubbish.","I like Nicole Kidman, and think she is a talented actress. So I watched this expectantly as I enjoy a film that stimulates the thought processes.This is beautifully filmed, of course with a score that is supposed to add to the ""tension"" I suppose.So what's it about. Pre-pubescent male obsession? Spirit re-incarnation? Grief unrequited? Women's psyche? Man's psyche even? The human condition?Erghm no. It's pretentious rubbish with loads of shots of Nicole Kidman about to burst into tears or have a breakdown over a 10 year old kid who for no apparent reason says he is her dead husband, set to a dramatic musical score.Possibly the biggest waste of a couple of hours of my time since I ran over a nail and blew a tire last month, but less entertaining."
4,A Very Odd Film,"Not everyone will like this film. I just saw it for the first time. Visually, its beautiful. The lighting and the sets are lovely. The story is a little slow at times but it seems to be an intentional choice by the writers and the director. Jonathan Glazer has made one previously film and lots of videos so his films are always going to have an edge to them and be visually beautiful. I enjoyed the film but I especially enjoyed the soundtrack. The first song in the film and the visuals that go with it are spectacular.Overall, its a gorgeous film with wonderfully strong performances from a great cast. Its just a little slow."
3,Trapped in a little boy's body.,"Birth starring Nicole Kidman has got to be the strangest film of 2004. You will either love or really despise this film. I am torn in the middle, first of all Nicole Kidman is an extraordinary actress but the plot is thin and unsympathetic. The ending was pretty straightforward but Birth is pretty much a headscratcher, every character seems detached and robotic especially the little boy who tries to seduce Kidman's character, what a creepy kid! To some people, Birth will amaze you and for the rest, this one will give you the willies!"
1,What was the producer thinking,"There was no depth to this movie, it was unbelievably boring. I was so disappointed with the movie and I could not believe the ending. There were way too many long drawn out scenes and the opera scene had to be the worse, I swear it felt like ten long drawn out moments with the same dreadful music playing, looking at Nicole Kidman's face. Also I found the story line to be very disgusting. If you are a sick warped individual this movies perfect for you and I could have did without the sex scene that looked like it was from a cheap porno. The movie was a waste of money.Rose DesRochersTodays-Woman.net"
1,Don't Rent This Unless You Have INSOMNIA!!!,"If you can't fall asleep, this is a great sedative. The first 40 minutes utterly drag and the boy never provides really convincing evidence of reincarnation. Then in the end it's like ""That's IT!!"" Try watching ""The Reincarnation of Peter Proud."" The only part of the movie I enjoyed was observing the interior of their penthouse, because I like their traditional decorating. There is way too much silence in the movie. I can see only a film student appreciating this, or someone who loves Nicole Kidman so much that they will watch anything she is in no matter how terrible it is. This is NOTHING like ""The Sixth Sense"" and if they were trying to copy the idea of a creepy little boy and dead people, they missed it on this one."
2,Color and holding mechanism not as described,"The package shipped very quickly.The mats fit well the Audi A4.I had to return them though for the following reasons:- the color was not as in the Amazon picture (they were dark gray instead of light gray - I chose ""Charcoal"" color)- there was no means to attach them to the holders on the car's floor - in the picture there are some holes that are not present on the mats."
3,"the quality is ok, but the size and shape is wrong","The color and quality look good. But all pieces are significantly bigger. They also don't have those holes that are supposed to help them stay in place (like on the picture). I managed to fit the front pieces, but don't know yet what to do with the back, they are so big and wide."
5,Heron,Love this decoy. It sits next to our fish pond to protect the goldfish from our neighborhood heron. We're very pleased with this product as well as the speedy delivery!
3,Blue Heron,I bought because it was cheap but the wind has bent the pole it sits on & color is fading so you get what you pay for! Next Blue heron I buy will have TWO legs to sit on as they say these stay up in the wind better.This company DID ship fast !
4,Blue Heron,"Before installing the plastic heron we lost about four koi from our fishpond in a week or two to an egret. Since installing the product last month we have not lost any further fish. It seems to work and although we are in principle against plastic ornaments in our garden, it does not look too bad."
5,just as described. Great product,"Kind of had my doubts about this when I bought it, but I had to try something. a Blue Heron was decimating my fish pond, and I didn't want to kill it. It Worked! Glad you were there when I needed you.Thanks"
2,This is NOT the music from the TV show,"I'd loved ""Speed Racer"" as a kid, so I went looking for the music from the soundtrack. When I found this CD, the ""Complete Song Collection,"" I thought I'd struck gold. Unfortunately, this was not the case.Apparently, there has been a more recently released Speed Racer cartoon that has a techno soundtrack. This CD has THOSE songs. But since all of the song titles were written in Japanese, I had no idea this was the case until I'd opened the package. So, as a techno CD, it's not bad. There are actually some fairly cool remixes of the Japanese version of the Speed Racer theme song. However, if you, like me, were looking for the original orchestral music from the '60s TV show, this CD will be a bitter disappointment. Instead, you should search for ""Mach Go-Go Music File: Round 1."""
5,Blew me away,"I'm a lover of music and a producer of some, and this album totally blew me away. I think of Emil's vocals as like Brian Wilson, only one octave higher; or like Grandaddy, except less stylized and drawn out. The rhythms are almost fidgety, but steady nonetheless. What is amazing about this music is the way Emil builds a storm using sounds not usually found in pop music these days. Clarinets, saxophones, baritone snare drums, glockenspiels, barking keyboard bass, and odd percussion are layered gradually through each song to create wonderful compositions. Each song is like a mini party, with a warm up at the beginning, a huge development part, a climax near the end, and a cool down to finish it up. It's electronic music unplugged, it's fast woodsy party rock, and it's fantastic pop. Emil's lyrics are understated and catchy, poignant only when they need to be. Sub Pop seems to be promoting this stuff well, so I hope people catch on. I can't wait to hear what comes out next!"
4,Fantastic,"I got turned on to this artist via Rhapsody, I decided to buy the CD so I could enjoy the music in my car. I am happy that I did. The mellow but still up-beat groove is fun to listen to."
2,Very Theortical Approach to Forecasting,This is a very theoretical book.It is for the faint hearted who want to understand theory and do not want to apply in practice. This is not suited if you are looking to use the forecasting techniques in the next 24 hours to forecast sales of your business or your bank account balance or developing cool forecasting models.Good book to understand the basics and theoretical aspects of forecasting. I recommend a triple espresso if you plan to sit wit this for a few hours.
4,Sales Forecasting by Mentzer,"Best book of Sales Forecasting I have read, especially the chapters on forecast accuracy measurement and best practice."
5,caphalon omelete pan,This pan was made in the USA and the quality was excellent.It wasn't cheap looking. It stands up to its name.
1,9 weeks later and two phone calls and my warranty replacement has still not been shipped,9 weeks since Calphalon received by 5 qt dutch oven for warranty replacement (fyi NEVER cook cranberries in Calphalon they take the coating off of the pan) and my order still has not been processed. I call every week for a status updated and I am told it will be expditied and shipped the next day and it never gets expedited or shipped...TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! I still do not have my replacement nor has it even shipped!
3,Non-Stick Pan Set,"They arrived fine, but they were encased in pizza-box grade cardboard. I believe it was this that gave the pans scuffs and scratches. I sent my first purchase back, adn the seconds ones were a little better but not much. I just kept them since I can't afford to pay shipping again for this."
4,TOO EXPENSIVE,"XLNT product, but Amazon has just bumped the price up by $5 a box. (currently $17.95)...thats $1.12 per bar. Out of my price range :(The last time I ordered these a few months ago, all flavors were $12.95/box."
1,Propaganda at its' worst,"This film was made during WWII when our government was allied with The Soviet Union against the axis. It is definitely an ironic example of WWII propaganda. In the film, Russian peasants live a beautiful happy idyllic life until the Nazi's invade. The film depicts the brutality of the Nazis very well, but it presents a totally false image of life in prewar Russia, which, in the real world had famines and purges and the mass murder of millions of people. The Ukrainian peasants were so brutalized by Stalin that when the Germans invaded them, they thought that they were being liberated. They found out that the Nazi invasion was not liberation in short order. Never the less, this film is so distorted as to be a cross between something to laugh at and something to vomit over. The sugary depiction of life in pre-war Russia is ridiculous."
4,Definitive!,"In LITTLE GLORIA, Barbara Goldsmith has written the definitive biography of Gloria Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt has had a life that reads like a preposterous soap opera. Goldsmith details all of it, particularly the notorious custody trial in which Gloria's paternal aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, battled Gloria's notorious mother for custody. The fact that the focus of this well-publicized battle was just a single little girl too often is forgotten. This book is a thorough look into a fascinating footnote to history, and a glimpse at the lifestyle of America's richest family from the Gilded Age through the early years of the 20th Century. LITTLE GLORIA is required reading for students of American social history."
5,Little Gloria,"I absolutely love this book. I bought it when it first was published, but lost it in a house fire. If you are interested in the subject of this book and can find it in new condition, grab it up !"
2,Good for the basics,The DVD shows a couple of blues patterns which is a good start for a beginner trying to learn this style. The examples are easy to follow and fairly basic. I give it only two stars because for the lack of topics for the advanced drummer.
5,I love the pressure cooker and this book. Why?,"I work and coming home to face a pile of raw ingredients that somehow must be converted into a dinner is pretty depressing sometimes. Besides, I'm hungry too!Many people don't think of the pressure cooker as a tool for speedy cooking, but you can make delicious stews (try the one in this book, it's wonderful) and other roasts and one-pot dishes really quickly. I really love the steamed chicken; it's so digestible and really delicious. It helps to have this cookbook because it isn't always easy to figure out how to convert a regular recipe to a pressure-cooked version. These recipes never fail. We got a T-Fal pressure cooker and really use it a lot. I even make desserts in it."
4,Nice little book,"I like this book. Nothing at all actually ""wrong"" with it. The information is good and all the recipes I have tried turned out really well. It might be a good ""starter book"". However, I must honestly say that I would not have bought it if Miss Vickie's Big Book of Pressure Cooker Recipes had been available then. I like to get the most for the money. Miss Vickie's book is more than twice the size (considering thickness as well as the size of the pages...maybe more than 3 times larger), with much more information, time charts for every kind of food, and over 400 recipes. Yet, it doesn't cost a whole lot more. No photos in either book...but we all know what food looks like."
2,"High fat, little general info","Certainly the price is right but there is no nutritional info, no info on electric pressure cookers and the recipes are very high fat. I gave it two stars since there is a reasonalble variety of recipes. You tell from the ingredients it is high fat etc. there are many better cookbooks out there - anything by sass and the dummies guide for pressure cookers etc. I would send back but not worth the postage and then my order would go below 25 and I would have to pay shipping on the other items too. Go to your library and check it and others out first. Now I have done that after the horse left the barn as they say!"
4,De Luxe Indeed,"In a market full of copy-cat releases, Groovin' Records dares to take a step ahead of the pack with the House De Luxe compilation, a killer House DJ mix by master turntablist/producer/engineer Choco a.k.a. G-Dubs, who's best known for his studio work with the Wu-Tang Clan. With tracks from stars like Basement Jaxx to up and coming new jacks like Big Bear, no wonder the dance press is calling this ""one of the best House mix cds of the year"". The real deal, my friend."
5,BETTER THAN SEX!,You will never get bored of this masterpiece-mix of house music. Every track will leave you feeling grooves you never felt before! Get 2 copies and spread the joy!!!
1,Bumpy Red Itchy Rash,"I bought this at my grocery store because my skin has been so dry this winter.I figured if its made for babies, it would be safe. Wow, was I wrong! I do not have sensitive skin and I have never had such a severe reaction to any other skin product. My skin is covered with a bumpy. red and itchy rash after using this for about 4 nights in a row after showering.I have been using Cortisone 10 for the past three days and using benedryl to try and get rid of it. How are they selling this stuff with all the incidences of rashes? And for babies! This stuff should be removed from shelves everywhere."
4,Great moisturizer - be careful how you use it,"I purchased this recently and tried out what everybody before me has suggested... apply after bathing when skin is still wet, pat dry with a towel, and you're good to go! Just use a small amount because a little goes a long way, but I don't see how it could be sticky unless you slather on a ridiculous amount. It's much more effective than lotion, you use a lot less product, and it's also roughly 10 times faster than lotioning your entire body. I highly recommend trying this for dry skin, maybe a couple times a week!"
1,RASH!!!,"Awful, awful, awful! I did a search about allergic reaction to this gel and found these reviews!! Used it TWICE and endeded up with an itchy, splotchy red rash. And have I mentioned it's ITCHY!! I cant believe this product can stay on the market with all of these consistent physical reactions by so many people."
1,A serious rash from J&J Baby oil gel,"I'm really glad that there is a place to comment on products; thank you, Amazon! I used this for less than a week and developed a terrible blotchy red contact dermatitis all over my chest and stomach. I stopped using the product but the rash is still developing, now on my arms. I'm using oatmeal in the bath and lotion, but it isn't looking a whole lot better yet. I'm shocked at the number of products Johnson & Johnson has had on recall. This was a product that mothers could trust for use on their babies and I used their lavender baby bath with very good results until they change the formula. Shame on them and their dirty facilities. That people are suffering with rashes as they continue to sell this product! Such a fall for an American icon."
2,"Red, bumpy rash","I thought I was crazy. Why was I getting a red, bumpy, itchy rash after using a product that is supposed to be so good for you? I'm glad I'm not alone. I have tried off and on this winter to use it because it is so moisturizing. It takes OTC allergy medicine and topical hydrocortisone to relieve the itching and get the rash to subside. I hope this doesn't happen to babies or children."
3,good product,"I only came on line to see if you still sell the Lavender and calamine oil. I am so sad the you know longer carry this product. I don't have any babies or little ones anymore. My girls are in their teen years, but I always bought that for us to use after our showers."
1,Rash-Confirmed,"Last night I used this product after showering and followed the directions. Waking up this morning, I had an itchy red rashes all over my chest. I never, ever, break out in rashes. I did use the product all over my body and it seems my chest is the only part of my body that developed rashes. I browsed online trying to see what could be the cause of this rash and here I find all these reviews about others experiencing the same thing. I am almost positive this gave me a rash because this is the only product I have used on my skin recently. I put hydrocortisone cream on and it helped a little. I would not use on infants especially!"
1,RASH!,"Liked initially. Used for one week, then rash on legs where I used the product. Firey red, mottled---itchy! Never had an adverse reaction to any products before, so not just a case of sensitive skin."
1,Horrible Rash,"This product deserves a zero for its negative impacts. Like everyone else, I have also gotten a horrible rash from using it. I too used it for about a week after getting out of the shower (following the directions on the label exactly) and now I have small itchy red bumps on my hips and on the backs of my legs. I've been wondering where it came from and now I know. I'm throwing this stuff out and will avoid using other Johnson and Johnson products."
1,Horrible Product!,"I bought the baby oil product with the same ingredients. My husband, 1-month-old, and I all are broken out in an itchy, red rash. Shame on Johnson & Johnson for continuing to sell a product with these side effects, especially when targeted for babies!"
1,rash caused by babyoil gel,I purcahsed the Target brand baby oil gel which is comparable to the Johnson & Johnson product. Ths skin on my legs is very dry and I have been looking for something to add moisture to my skin. I tried this and liked it a lot for the first week. It made my legs look so much better and more smooth. I would apply it every night before sleeping to let it soak in. After about a week a red rash appeared on my legs and arms. I have had this small bumpy rash now for about a week and it isn't really going away. I think it could be from this product because the only thing I have done differently from my normal routine is to apply this baby oil gel.
4,Works perfectly,"I was able to use the motor to replace my old Nutone 8660 fan motor, but I had to first shorten the shaft to fit the fan housing. As you can see in the picture the shaft is much longer even though the motor comes up as a direct replacement. This motor is also sealed. The original has open vents in the housing, which probably contributed to it failing because of dust getting in the windings and bearings over the years. Any way, it works and was a good price."
5,vegetable book,got it from the library and really liked it..easy to read and use...so I ordered one from Amazon..this one was a hard cover so it will last longer than the soft bound from the library..
5,Great compositions and playing,"I wasn't familiar with Duke Levine, and heard a track on NPR that caught my attention. This is a guitar virtuoso that plays what is necessary without going over the top. His compositions are diverse, fun, and he has a wonderful sense of taste."
4,Another unknown master,"My preferences lean toward the blues and not country, therefore only 4 stars. The dominant flavour here is country, but BLUES / JAZZ and a number of other flavours make appearences. If you like the HELLECASTERS - JOHNNY A. - DANNY GATTON and the like, you will like / love this CD. The playing is of the highest standard and the compositions are superb. Great CD for just about any situation that even my mellower better half loves."
2,Slightly disappointed.,"This wasn't exactly what I was expected. For some reason I thought it would be larger, and have more pictures of Batman. I bought it for my friend for her birthday since she couldn't find a Batman coloring book in town, so I'm sure she'll be happy with it. I just wish it was a bit better."
3,Utopia through extra-terrestial influences,"I first read this and saw that it was a Utopian Novel which was much more positive than others I had also read(by Orwell,for instance).However,I can see now that,although highly disguised through the science-fiction and humanity,this was Wells' own Socialist ideas of the world.Wells is an author whose works can be read as either science fiction,human interest or social commentary."
3,Expected More,"An extremely verbose book on the social and political issues between the Boer War and World War I in England with a solution to the world's problem via the green mist left by Earth passing through a comet's tail. I truly enjoyed the movie renderings of ""The War of the Worlds"" (the first version with Gene Barry), ""The Time Machine"" and ""First Man on the Moon""; but I am let down by the wordiness of this novel and hope my reading of ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Time Machine"" do not do the same."
4,"Not just polemic, plotted polemic","In the Days of the Comet may not be Wells' finest scientific romance, but it is a provocative, insightful, often humorous and finally scandalous look at how the world may be transformed into a prelapsarian wonderland. The comet of the title dusts the earth and transforms the jealous and possessive behaviors of men and women into passions for cooperation and peace.Idyllic as it may seem, contemporary readers were aghast by the suggestion that religion, marriage, and capitalism, would (or should) be replaced by a primitivistic urge to help, share, and love. Granted, Wells was by no means a proto-hippie, but in this book we get the softer side of a writer who is elsewhere concerned with destroying the world and recreating it in his own image. This novel is the perfect antidote for the anti-social Wells we can find in his nonfiction.Bison's edition, unfortunately, does not include Wells' original epigraph (from Shelley), but does include a fair introduction by Ben Bova."
2,"Sheet fits well, but doesn't hold up to washing","This sheet has nice, deep pockets that fit easily, yet snugly on a crib mattress; however, it does not hold up to washing. Mine got large holes in them after only the second washing. I was quite disappointed as it's hard to find crib sheets that actually fit on the mattress. I wouldn't reccommend this product unless you have the time to handwash the sheets."
2,Happy Mom....not so happy,I bought two of these fitted sheets for my daughters bed and after washing and drying per the directions they both became so deformed in shape they barely fit her mattress. Crib sheets are supposed to fit snug but not that snug.I'll still use them but only in emergencies.
4,Buy it,I've read many personal narratives about World War II and I must say this is an excellent book!!!
1,Amerileather backpack,"I received the item on time. The product was good, just too small.Customer service for this company is awful!!! I will never again buy one of their products. Returns are way too difficult and costly."
1,Big Disapointment,"Wow. I was shocked at how small the pictures were. 1"" high by 4.5"" wide. This was a very very disappointing purchase.It clearly demonstrates why buying books on line can really be a problem.I sent in a suggestion to AMAZON to alert potential buyers that the pictures are so small and that there is only one picture every 2 pages.Dont waste your money until you have seen this at your local bookstore or in person.It is way over-rated here."
1,Dinky Pictures,"Gorgeous photographs that you need a microscope to examine. The total available area per page pair is 19 inches by 9 1/2 inches and most of the photos measure 1 inch by 4 inches. Excuse me?? I don't know and cannot imagine what the editor and publisher were thinking about. Lilliput maybe?? This is not a book of photographs, it is a book of glossy white pages. I bought it as a coffee table book and to share with my son when he gets older but I'm afraid I am going to return it as I can't afford to waste fifteen dollars."
1,Thumbnails on the web are larger,"This book was a waste of my money. As stated above, there is one pic for every 2 pages and it's 1 x 4.5 inches. The area is gorgeous and I'm sure the pictures are lovely, if you could see them well enough to get a sense of it. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY>"
2,Not enough detail,"I bought these cards to supplement A&P, but the cards do not go into enough detail to be very useful. Also, I've found several smaller mistakes, and one large mistake (one of the cards of the heart was labeled backwards - I confirmed this with my instructor). After a couple weeks I went back and bought the Netter's flash cards - they were comparably priced and are *much* more useful."
1,BARRON'S ANATOMY FLASHCARDS,"I just bought BARRON'S ANATOMY FLASHCARDS, ISBN 0764178326,and I am disappointed with the product, because on card number 11 (skeletal system) there are several mistakes. Card number 11 identifies the carpal bones erroneously (incorrect name and location). I contacted the publisher and they promised to correct the problem on the next printing. I thought the cards to be beautifully made, but as an Anatomy tutor, I can not recommend them since when you are first learning something it is extremely important to get it right. I did not bother to keep reading the rest of the cards, so I do not know how many mistakes there are in the entire deck. It is a shame that such a wonderfully crafted and useful tool contains mistakes like that. I will return it because I can not rely on the information given by the product."
4,Invaluable tool for visual learners,"Wish I'd had these back when taking anatomy and physiology courses. I was so impressed, I bought a set and use them for quick review and reference to this day. Well organized, easy to review, and greatly detailed... overall,Barron's Anatomy Flash Cardsare an invaluable fine learning tool."
2,Incorrect information,"I got this hoping that It would help me study for my exam. I spent most of the time correcting the flash cards and HOPING that they were right. Don't buy this item, I found so, so many mistakes it was ridiculous and really rude."
2,Anatomy flash cards,Very time consuming and rediculously organized. The only thing I liked about the product is the free anatomy poster. The cards are not well organized and hard to get out of the box. Also Integumentary Sytem is not included.
5,what a great show,"I started watching this show on netflix, and I'm planning on getting all the episodes on blue-ray in time. If you like BBC shows, and like something different you should give this show a try."
4,Torchwood,"This season had more engaging episodes than the first season. The characters were engaging. However, Owen's ongoing condition got a bit tiresome."
3,Would have been a really good episode,"This would have been a really good episode if not for the soundtrack. The last two episodes had really depressing soundtracks that played at times that weren't depressing. There were places in the story line that the track (as crap as the music they selected was) would have fit but instead they played it at really weird times and made the story seem disjointed. But this has definitely been one of the better episodes so far, storywise. They weren't horribly depressing, there wasn't sex for the sake of sex, and the acting wasn't miserable (also I agree with the previous rater and that without Owen this episode got better for me)."
3,Decent mix of ideas that deliver,"Nice mix of techno-gadget and time-travel with some revenge tossed in. A fun ride. Bad guy bites it, but so do a few others on his way down."
1,Puzzled,I can not understand why the creators of this show have a need to make every character gay or bisexual as if this accurately reflects people in general or makes the characters somehow more highly evolved. Very disappointing that the creators have ruined what would otherwise be good sci-fi by trying to make a social statement about homosexuality.
1,Horrid little show.,"In any story or film you've got to have at least one character you like or sympathize with and in Torchwood you'll not have even half a one. Bad writing, bad acting, bad special effects. [...] If it's sexy, sensual, great special effects and better that excellent writing Sci-Fi you want best to buy, Farscape, Lexx, Dr. Who, the X-Files, than this sloppy seconds Sci-Fi wannabe."
1,VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING,You can not get around the Agenda built into this show. It ruins it completely. This could have been a great sci fi program and worthy spin off of Doctor Who but fails. Many scenes are totally appalling and no one wants to see nor care about. A waste of some good talent and characters. But thats what happens when you try to put forth a pc agenda no one wants to see or care for. Sad could have been good.
2,Lacks Dr. Who's light heart.,"I bought this series having never seen it but it had Captain Jack and I loved him in Dr. Who. I was so disappointed. It's darker , less fun and very focused on exploring sex in all it's dimensions. I was just so hoping for the wonder and fun and morals of Doctor Who. Oh well I learned my lesson."
5,Go Torchwood,I love torchwood it is the best show. If you like Dr Who you will love Torchwood it is great.
2,poorly written.,"I can suspend disbelief with the monsters and aliens and all, but to stretch it to believe that this bunch are actually a part of a world saving organization, and that they actually save the world, is just too far out to accomplish. this is so poorly written that it is an embarrassment. I give it two stars because the production values are so high."
4,Promising but flawed,"The first season of Torchwood shows tremendous promise, and that's partly where my 4**** rating comes from. The show itself has some deep flaws, most notably the change in character for Captain Jack from his appearances on Doctor Who, where he has a much more charming personality. Here he tends all too often to bark his lines and yell a lot. It seems that later in the season Barrowman finds his way again and gets Jack back on track. Of the supporting characters, there are problems as well, including too much rebellion and conflict among the team - they are, after all, people we're supposed to like and want to invite into our homes on TV or DVD, but all too often they aren't.All of that said, some of these stories are fantastic, and I'm excited to see what they come up with for their second season! I'd recommend sci-fi fans give the show a try."
4,Romantic and reflective,"This episode is a bit of a departure from the usual scenario of alien crazy messes with the world. Here we have the simple plot of three people from the past landing in modern Cardif and facing all the reality of losing love, finding it, and creating new lives. It is very reminiscent of the original Star Trek episode of 'City on the Edge Forever.' It is more character and emotionally based than the usual techno-gadgets and flashy action. Nice change of pace and well acted by all...and I'm not a romantic at heart."
3,Fantastic Series. Great Extras. Horrible DVD quality,"[...][...]Very enjoyable. Very dark, well written and interesting. My only complaint is that I could do with a bit less explicitness. ""Dark"" and ""mature"" themes (even sexual themes) can be presented very effectively without spelling it all out for us in the form of excessive nudity, blood, and in-your-fact sex. [...]Looking forward to series two, and hoping that they get the production glitches ironed out."
1,The worst thing Britian has ever produced.,"I can make this short and sweet, horrid Buffy wanna-be poor writing, pathetic plots...if you saw the series Extra second season, and you saw what they did to the show he was trying to make, all I can figure is this is the real life result of what the character BBC forced Rick's character to work with in that show would have made on his own.P.S. If you are a zombie and you can talk...you can breath...that is how talking works....so you can give mouth to mouth...all I can figure is they hired people with no education to write the shows. The only good thing about this series is it makes the worst of the Star Trek series look like the best of the Farscape series."
1,Crappiest sci-fi series I have ever watched,"I am a huge fan of sci-fi. I love X-files and Firefly, for instance, and Torchwood is less than pale in comparison to these great sci-fi series. I get that sci-fi is supposed to cater to the improbable, but the acting and the story lines are so difficult to believe that I could not get into the series. I still gave it a chance by watching a few episodes, but then the drama between the characters started getting totally ridiculous. I would not recommend this series to anyone."
1,Pornography disguised as Science Fiction,"For the most part, Torchwood is pornography disguised as science fiction. It's a vehicle for casual promiscuous sex, and the producer writers in their reviews seem to be very proud of it.The few episodes that were not about sex had an X-file feel to them, but in Torchwood there's none of that platonic love that you find and admire between Muldar and Skully.What's the worst is that you are expecting a Dr. Who chivalry aspect to Torchwood, and that's not there either.The immortal hero who can't die is pretty much the only cool 'gimick' that Torchwood has going for it.I collect Dr. Who. I borrowed Torchwood from the library to see if it was as bad as everyone is saying. It is as bad a they are saying. I put hundreds of dollars into Dr. Who. But, I'm not going to spend any money on Torchwood.At least in the new Battlestar Galactica series, the whole series isn't just about sex. The first season of Torchwood is pretty much all about sex."
2,X-Files Meets Shagtown,"At first, I didn't quite like this series. Then, after viewing it, I really didn't like this series.The characters - from Gwen to Cap'n Jack - are so unreliable and so obsessed with falling in love or bedding one another (or regretting falling in love and/or bedding one another) that the entire series would only be believable if it was set in a small town coffee shop and its characters were over-stimulated 20somethings with nothing other to do than lie (either about themselves or with their co-workers).As for the alien threats, you have to stick around for the majority of the series until you hit an episode with a fear-inspiring foe and an emotionally-packed ride."
1,Couldn't get through the first series,"I tried to like this series but just couldn't do it. I read reviews saying it was Dr. Who but rejigged to appeal to adults. Well, if you're a gay atheist that loves corny science fantasy then you win because that's obviously who the producers are appealing to. Plots are very thin, characters are all sluts (male & female, gay & straight) and utterly lacking a moral compass. Perhaps series 2 and onwards improve (viewership in the UK must have been abysmal for this dross) but I won't be buying."
5,Incredible.,"I adore this series. It's dark and sexy enough to hold me in with a healthy dose of one liners to keep things upbeat. I bought this after watching the entire first TWO series on youtube, on a tiny computer screen! Was well worth it, have forced my family to watch my favorite episodes and bloopers over and over!"
1,They're not lying,"This is a review of just the Cyberwoman episode. I wish I could wipe this episode from my memory. I really like scifi and powered my way through five seasons of Primeval without a second thought about the usefulness of the time I spent on it but this episode made me feel silly for watching. The previous reviewers aren't lying, the acting is bad in this one (except the Japanese guy, so the guest actor with the fewest lines did well at least).Some positives: To be fair, they did a really nice job on the fake body with all the metal stuck through it. Aces to the prop team, and even though Lisa's metal suit design would look at home on the set of Power Rangers (or Xena) it was at least really well built. Oh, and the actor who plays Jack was good at acting like he was being electrocuted. That's all the positives I've got.So yeah, skip this one. At least now I can get some sleep instead of getting hooked into watching another episode."
2,Wildy Disappointed,"Wow! Now that I have completed the first season I have to say that I am widly disappointed. I held out hope that the season would improve, but there were no signs of it by the end.While the cinematography and general sci-fi feel are OK, the characters (other than Caption Jack) are absolutely miserable. I kept hoping that they would all be killed by the end, but alas I knew I would be disappointed since they are in Season Two. Even Captian Jack was only a shade of his brilliance in Doctor Who.I can't believe that Russell T. Davies could be associated with this. My opinion of his writing has just taken a heavy hit. I will certainly not be buying Season Two nor watching it for free if I can watch The Doctor in a re-run."
3,Promising but not as good as it could be,"I was hugely looking forward to this series but ended up a little disappointed. The concept is great, most of the story ideas also were (well, not all), but there are lots of shortcomings. The acting is at times downright bad (especially the actor playing Owen), the plots are about as full of holes as Swiss cheese, and most action scenes look downright silly. Still, the series has its moments, and the slow, more reflective episodes really shine; the highlight certainly being ""Captain Jack Harkness"". I just hope that season 2 picks up where this season leaves off. I will, despite my misgivings, be back to watch it."
5,"I LOVE the show, but future viewers be warned!","I absolutely LOVE this show. I am a big fan of Dr. Who, so when I got Amazon Prime and saw that this was for free, I thought ""Why the hell not?!"" I was not disappointed. Action-packed cop-ness with a Sci-fi twist! However, if you want a familiy-friendly, nice ""good vs. evil"" and ""good guys catch bad guys, hoorah!"", this is not for you. Contains strong language, violence, and the occasional sex scene/reference. So, if your fine with that, WATCH THIS SHOW! The only real complaints I have are that Jack is a little meaner than I would like (but its understandable) and Gwen cries too much. 5 stars!"
4,Jack finds a moment of love and the man of his name,"Well you don't find a story of love about two people caught in a time rift every day, okay...well you do. There are a lot of them in the same genre of 'Stranger in Time' and 'Time and Again' but rarely, if ever, do you find the romantic interests between the two lead guys. That's right, the dudes find each other dare to feel what they feel and then step out on the dance floor of life and own it. Honest sentiment, well acted, and as always...time wins. This episode has a great, authentic 40's feel and the actor playing 1943 Captain Jack nails it."
3,A bad rip-off of Jeepers Creepers?,"Its when the woman rescues the Torchwoodies stuck in a cellar that one realizes the lurking suspicion which has been growing on the viewer all through this 'filler' episode of Torchwood - it seems dreamed up by the writers after a night of creative vacuity and having watched Jeepers Creepers - the classic horror film where a killer returns every 27 years or so takes fresh victims.The flesh eating killer in the countryside is a meme that's overcooked and this episode of Torchwood can be passed over safely. That being said, you'd miss the growing attraction between two of Torchwood's loyal members if you skipped it, so watch at least the first 10 minutes, then skip to the denounement."
4,Awesome series with great extras,"This is a really great Sci-Fi series on the BBC that I happened upon, being a big doctor who fan. It stars John Barrowman, who was Captain Jack in the new doctor who series. It is very edgy and adult with lots of great humor.Getting this on blu-ray is well worth it for all the great action sequences and the extas are pretty cool too. There is a gag reel and tons of behind the scenes clips. I would highly recommend this to any sci-fi or doctor who fan."
1,"A very bad spin-off of ""Doctor Who"".","""Torchwood"" has a great concept, but is ruined with bad plots and way too much drama. ""Doctor Who"" is an action series, but ""Torchwood"" is nothing more than a drama with very lazy writing and very little suspense. It does have it's good episodes, but they're few and fare in between. Not recommended!"
3,Torchwood Season 1 on DVD,"The DVDS themselves are in perfect condition, but the casing they came in was cracked and not attached the box itself. Also some of the DVDs fall out when you open the box because they have nothing keeping them in. I have my hesitations about buying furthers seasons from this seller since this was a gift to someone else."
4,Torchwood//Some Episodes Really Light Up,I Watched all 13 Episodes Of The First Season And Enjoyed Most Of The Episodes//Just A Couple Of Stories That I Did Not Care For//However I Know That The Ones That I Don't Like Someone out there will Love//I Did Like Episode #10 OUT OF TIME//It Was Very Very Interesting As Most Of Them Are//I'm Looking Foward To Season 2I'm Sure That Most Of The Episodes Will Even Be More Interesting//Stanley Cooper Jupiter Florida[...]
5,A lifetime favorite...,"The problem with the US and the UK is that we still have different mindsets -- from current events to physical and emotional displays. Torchwood is one of the most daring shows I've seen to date. The storylines show innovation and feeling; no character's gender or personal attraction is singled out because of whom they interact with, whether physical or not. The Torchwood staff is unique team of real people who happen to have the means to protect the planet.While it was marketed as a spin-off from the [incredible] new Doctor Who series, this first season of Torchwood has certainly proven itself on its own with original characters realistically created. The show depicts a world in which exists newfound frivolity and homosexuality to losing new interests and old loved ones. Now that's real life, folks...why have we still not gotten used to it?"
3,Not the same Captain Jack,"Torchwood's Captain Jack Harkness is more sombre and serious than his character from Dr. Who. Strangely he is often peripheral in the espisodes that seem to revolve around Gwen and Owen. I won't mention any spoilers, but his staff are not always behind Jack and demonstrate it. In fact, Gwen, Tosh, Owen and Ianto, the main characters often are in need of a whack on the head for not doing what they know they should. Professional in some ways, but emotionally each is a bit of a mess.The stories range from very good to mediocre. Actually I liked the two 'Suzie' espisodes best. The special effects are good and so is the acting. The actors just need stronger more original stories. I am hoping that the next season brings back Captain Jack Harkness of Dr. Who."
4,Torchwood,"* Very good acting.* Special affects are very well done, along with make overs.* Need to view ""Dr. Who"" series to get better understanding of main character Captian Jack Harkness.* Danger with these series is that they get a little soapy."
5,Torchwood Burns,A terrific compilation of the first season with tons of extras. The Commentary and the ability to watch with subtitles during the commentary made this a treat. A friend who was visiting and had never seen the show went thru the entire set in two days !!! I thought I was obsessed. Can't wait for series 2 to come to DVD as a box set and hold out hope for a series three. Best thing from BBC for adult SF fans in a long time. THANK YOU RUSSELL T. DAVIES !!!
1,Not For Children or Families,"This show is not for families or children. It is a sad attempt to cash in on the Dr. Who franchise. After wading through the first season I found the stories tedious and weak. It seems that the creators are attempting to push some political correct sexual mores into their stories since more often than not the characters are involved sexually with each other, as well other characters they come across."
1,Dissapointing Series,"I had high hopes for the series. Especially being a doctor who fan and it being a Dr Who spinoff. The actors were good but the stories often contained scenes and images that I can only describe as grimey, dirty, and ugly. A good scifi series should spark your imagination. This one simply left me wishing I could purge from my mind of the ugly things I saw. Do yourself a favour and don't go near it."
1,"Torchwood, snoging the world, one alien at a time!","Very rollercoaster. Characters have much potential that was, for the most part, unrealized in the first season. Too dependent on having seen all the episodes of Doctor Who in which the lead character Jack appears, as well as random monsters, unexplained ""voids"", and time rifts. Add to that the fact that there's apparently a whole library of books about Torchwood and you get a big jumble of characters and events jumping centuries as well as out of sequence. Whom the Gods wish to destroy the first call ""promising!""Don't waste you money or time. You'll simply never catch up...."
2,"So, this is what passes for cops in England?","This is the keystone cops meet pornography. And yes, the second episode is softcore porn. This isn't moralizing, it's noticing the obvious. In one of the episodes, no less than three of their team members have guns on the bad guys and they STILL get disarmed by their own incompetence (namely, one of the characters is having a conscience issue with shooting a self proclaimed mass murderer). The dialogue is idiotic and the plots are what you'd expect from a 6th grade sci fi fan (I'm thinking like beevus and butthead, ""heh, heh, let's make a female alien who kills people with sex, heh, heh...). If you're looking for decent sci fi, try Primeval, it's so much better."
5,Torchwood Complete First Season,It's a great series. It has wonderful actors (John Barrowman!!) and the writing is superb.
2,"They ruined Captain Jack, he is better on Doctor Who.","I just finished season one and it is amazing how they can take the character of Captain Jack and turn him into a jerk. He was great in Doctor Who, I liked a few of the episodes and there are too many half naked men, other then that I am okay with all the Homosexuality. My only other gripe is that Ianto should have been fired after that cyberwoman episode, instead of just getting a slap on the wrist. I thought this would be a more scfi oriented show, hopefully season two is better, I am starting on that next."
5,Torchwood -Season 1,Totally Awesome series. We rented the series and fell in love with it and had to buy it as it is one you can watch over and over. The only thing I might caution anyone on is unlike American television the BBC shows are not censored like ours are so you will see some risque stuff. The characters are wonderful and the acting is amazing and it was just a huge bonus that it's a spin off from Doctor Who (The greatest series of ALL TIME!!!) I really recommend the show if you are a Who fan or even just a regular sci-fi fan.
5,Torchwood!,these are great shows and are very entertaining for all ages. Great casts and writing as well as good music.
3,Get through the first few episodes and it gets better,"It really picks up after the first few episodes. It turns in to a pretty entertaining show with a few awesome episodes. It can definitely pull you in and fix a craving for the DrWho-verse, just don't expect quite dr who level quality."
5,Spin Offs,"Well I will be the first to say that usually spin offs are not my cup of tea. I usually avoid spin offs since they usually let me down. there have been few exceptions to this and Torchwood is one of them. I have found the show highly creative and fun. So if spin offs are always your thing, give this one a try, you may find yourself surprised."
1,"If you liked the Mystery Science 3000 movies, this is for you!!!!!","I read the other reviews here, and I'll admit it, they suckered me in. Mentioning CSI, and more importantly Firefly with this series is defamation of character. The special effects are so bad that I went back to look at the box to make sure this wasn't released in the 80's. The first episode was the best, after that I could only muscle through another 5 episodes, each one getting more stilted, and boring, and far fetched. I am a geek, so maybe a little tough, but REALLY, this is about the quality of ""Earnest goes to (Space) Camp"". Save your money, I'll give you mine!! Like I said, if you liked the movies on MS 3000 and couldn't understand why they were picking on them, buy this."
5,Torchwood,"'Torchwood' is a quirky British SciFi series about a special unit that tracks down otherworldly events and aliens. For the most part it's character driven and frequently dark but there are lovely moments of humor to balance the pathos. The characters are worth caring about as their personalities evolve over time from cold individualists to a supportive team of specialists. Unlike most British programs that cross the big pond, the characters have easily understandable accents and the occasional references to politics and cultural differences do not detract from the plot lines. The actors are accomplished and likable and the scripts are well written and engrossing."
2,Really tried to like this show...,"I've been favorably impressed with other BBC shows I've seen via Amazon Prime IV, so was looking forward to this one as well despite the difference in genre. [The ones I've liked recently are Bleak House and Downton Abbey, but I also enjoy sci-fi. Dr. Who was an old favorite of mine growing up, as was Star Trek Next Gen, etc. etc. - so this is not a genre-based issue for me.] I'm second generation American, but most of my mother's family is still over in Wales, so I was excited about a show based in Cardiff, and quite predisposed to like it. The plot sounded interesting on synopsis, and I like the main actress, who in my opinion does a very good job with a very poor script. The actual episodes are barely coherent in their plotlines, and create situations so ludicrously unrealistic and implausible as to make suspension of disbelief untenable. I gave up halfway through the second episode."
2,So Dark It is Depressing,"Torchwood - what a great idea for a Dr. Who spin-off! A little more dark than Who? Well, OK. Unfortunately the show is so dark it is depressing. In almost every episode someone close to a main character dies unpleasantly, everyone in Torchwood betrays everyone else, all beautiful things have horror inside, and as one character says ""no one is nice, nobody cares."" Such a pity - it could have been fun."
3,"Great series, really poor DVDs","As others have summarized the episodes and the premise I'll skim over that aspect, save to say this fills a TV void left by the departure of such creative shows like the X-Files and Buffy. Yes, they seem to have the need to add gratuitous sexual content to every, single episode, but this can be forgiven as you'll like the characters and the writing.(...)"
1,"Awful, awful and awful","Unless you like logical inconsistencies, lots and lots of whining, and some really terrible acting, you'll not like this episode. I'd recommend saving yourself some pain and skip right over it."
2,"Torchwood, first season","Having seen & enjoyed Dr. Who & with the high ratings this series was being given, I expected a lot more from it. I loved the first two shows, but as I got deeper into the series I thought it deteriorated into specious ridiculousness. There was so much great material to work with & they could have done so much better. One thing I think was missing was an on-going touch of humor (humour, if you're Brit). Guess I'll stick with Firefly."
1,I want to punch everyone in this show.,"Leave it to Jack to assemble a team composed entirely of incompetent, whiny little bitches. And then hardly be in his own show. I sat through almost the entire first season, really wanting to like it because I love Doctor Who. But this is not Doctor Who. It is an awful show that gets worse as it goes along. Never have I seen so much hormone-driven high school drama crap in a sci-fi show. I would rather watch Stargate Universe."
2,Funny but not always fun,"Ghost takes over bodies for their sex energy. Really. Must have been a rough week for the writers, though some of the tech created for this episode is done nicely. Not bad, not great. Sexy if you're seventeen. Consider this episode a bologna sandwich on white bread with mayonnaise...nothing else. It fills you up but doesn't nourish or inspire."
2,More miss than hit,"I don't quite know what this show was aiming for. I think an Adult oriented show for people that liked Doctor Who and over the age of 18.Sure, Captain Jack was there but he was not the fun rogue that he was on Doctor Who but a drull leader of a group called Torchwood. Pretty much everyone was so serious that they weren't engaging enough to hold your interest and the chemistry and writing were not there to suck you in and make it a real guilty pleasure.The Producers idea of being an adult show seemed to be throwing a sex scene in every so often for titilation purposes. Sex is fine but only when the story really calls for it and it makes sense for other reasons that just being there to be there.The last three episodes of the season did improve a bit and am hoping they continue with the writing similar to these last few episodes. One can only hope they lighten up a bit."
1,"Torch wood fantastic, scratched disks that kept freezing my Mac, the worst. Am returning it.",See the title. I am so disappointed. It was a purchase of used DVDs that were supposed to be in great shape. Caveat Emptor! I lost chunks out of the middle of several episodes and I don't know how one ended and another started. That's why I am returning them. Is that enough words in the review now?
4,Captain Jack,"Ok so torchwood is great and all, but this isnt what this review is about. One thing that annoys the crap out of me is Jack's pronunciations of words. The actor himself was raised in Illinois so he should have an American accent right? So then why does he pronounce some words like the brits do?Examples:In episode 1 he pronounced the word Estrogen ""E-stro-gen"" instead of ""eh-stro-gen"" and in this episode he said ""Pee-do-file"" instead of ""Ped-a-file"".It just bothers me... ok im done lol"
2,Expected more... but still fairly good,"I was very anxious to view this show once I received it but quite frankly, it wasn't as good as I expected. Of course being a BBC show should have been a clue to me that the cast would be British, therefore with British accent & expressions that I'm not custom to hear, which made it really painful to understand. As for the plot, well, I can't say that it was that great either. I'm just used to better quality than this. One thing for sure, I'm not buying season 2, and might not even rent it... Definitely not worth the asking price."
2,I didn't like the soun but CD design was cool.,They should probabley stick to ska and get a little more edge becuz there sound isn't that great.
2,Missing sections,The whole did not upload. The writing was somewhat archaic in form. Did not get to read the whole book so cannot comment.
5,Amazing!..,"This is by far one of DJ Dero's best traxx ever. If you like 666's AMOKK 0r Lock & Load's BLOW YOUR MIND, you will absolutely love this one too. Extremely energetic and fast paced, it will surely get the party started. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up, I guarantee you won't be dissapointed."
4,What are you talking about?,I don't understand why anyone would bash this book. Maybe you just didn't get it. I found it to be a little drawn out but Hawthorne's use of smbolism was so incredibly obvious. The whole book was based on smbolism. It was worth the read.
1,BORING!,"It is 3 in the morning and I am trying to read this book, which has to be the most boring and worse writtien novel that I have ever picked up. I am being forced to read it by my school. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HORRIBLE BOOK!!!!! If anyone has any suggestions on how to keep myself awake through this book, please email me."
4,hawthorn- a master of symbolic literature,"read it twice, the frist time you get the plot the second you get the true skill it took to write it"
5,--A treasure to those who take time to read it,"This rich, beautiful tale of forbidden love is possibly the best book I have ever read. It is filled with rich detail and fascinating symbolism. It left me in tears and in awe."
3,The book is very complicated and over-wordy.,"Hawthorne uses a lot of symbolism and themes, most of which he over-uses. His sentences last for paragraphs, and his style is so sophisticated it gave me headaches to read it. If you want something to put you to sleep, this is it. Ow. I personally disliked the book and I would rather eat my gym socks than read it over again. Booorrring!!!!!!"
1,"This book was interesting, however, wordy and undramatic.",The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne was excellent. This criticism destroys the fundamental point of reading the book; to interperet on your own.
2,Overly descriptive,"While the book has an interesting back-story, and a nice moral (religion gets you nowhere), it is overly descriptive, and at times, boring. However, some of the last scenes are rather nice, but it doesn't quite help the rest of the book. The vocabulary used doesn't help, and the storyline is far too off-track to be worth reading. I'll take Twelfth Night over this any day. (definately worth reading)"
2,It does not encompase the puritanism found within the novel,"I designate the novel transcendental, using the term in a sense that will be distinguished from romanticism, for the use of transcendentalism is usually considered with in the bounds of romanticism. The reading does not attempt to even specify this."
2,997C Problems,"I purchased one of the very first 997C units. I waited six months for the release. I have also purchased two of the Cannon Mag20 DT's that can be controlled by the 997C.The head unit has been back to the factory twice and both of the Mag20 DT's have been back to the factory. I have had to take the boat apart twice to install a new transducer and then to install a new connecting cable between the two Mag20's. All of this has taken over a year. The last component that the factory had me replace was the CannonLink. The system still does not work and the factory is stumped. I have been waiting over three weeks for them to get back to me with what they want to try next.I do believe that if everything worked it would be a great fishing package, but with all of the frustrations I have experienced I am about ready to junk the system and try something else.PS. I have over $4,000 invested in this system."
3,Good but uncomfortable,"I do a lot of woodworking. When I had Lasik eye surgery recently I needed to get a quality set of safety glasses that not only keep debris out of my eyes, but also dust as well. These certainly do the trick. They're relatively inexpensive, reasonably fog free, and optically clear too. The only challenge is that they are very uncomfortable. No matter how much I futz with the adjustment strap I can still only wear them for an hour or two at a time."
5,I LOVED IT!,"Debra's story made me believe that if she can do it, I can do it. The Give It A Go Assignments have been great because she gave me tangible to do's which got me going. I'm already seeing new results from following the strategies in the book and I've been sharing it with my friends and family."
3,old school,its great to take a break from the newer more compicated games and rexal with some old school simple and fun games like this one. still a challenge at times but easy to play and can be done in a much shorter period of time.
5,Great Game,We received this game promptly and it was in great condition. Only worked on older computers though
3,meh,I expected the disc to run better than it does. It often degrades into an unwatchable and unplayable format. You get what you pay for.
4,Hot Stuff,"TERRIFIC READ!I HAVE JUST READ A MESMERIZING BOOK ABOUT MARLON BRANDO. THE AUTHOR IS GEORGE ENGLUND...I'VE NOT HEARD OF ENGLUND BEFORE BUT THIE GUY CAN REALLY WRITE. I KNOW HOW INTERESTED YOU ARE IN BRANDO SO RUN,DON'T WALK, TO YOUR NEAREST BOOKSELLER AND GRAB A COPY. I KNOW YOU'LL LOVE IT"
1,A Downer!,"A REAL downer. I realize Marlon Brando's life had many sadnesses, but this book really seemed to dwell on them. Mr Englund told of how HE thought. I wanted to hear how Mr Brando thought.The ending really ticked me off...I saw no need for the story of Butch, the dog.A TOO SAD story.I do agree with the review by Book Review Weekly."
2,They Wear WHAT Under Their Kilts?,"I didn't like the email format of this book. It was hard to follow. It was a funny book, but more for the younger set, not for older folks like me. It was OK, but I don't think I will purchase any more books by this author unless the age group is older."
2,Very superficial,"I have a good grounding in photography and was hoping for more detailed instruction on product photography. I learned practically nothing. There is a lot of very elementary filler material on general photography, digital cameras and editing software and Internet. The photos are not that great either. May be somewhat useful for someone who has no knowledge at all of these topics"
3,Dick Vitale+television+college basketball=nice movie,"Dreamtime features Dickie V. watching TV using some graphic magic to introduce some bits and bytes about college B-Ball. In fact, there is some that is nothing to do with College B-Ball. This is a very nice movie, but it needs more college B-Ball action!"
5,Love love love these rings,"I was worried about buying this set of rings, when I received them I thought they were beautiful! They are very true to size, so if you purchase them for your dominant hand order a size bigger, I have gotten so many compliments on them, they look real...and I'm not telling anyone there not!"
3,Not real sterling silver,Purchased these for my wedding ring to wear on opposite sides. I got a lot of compliments on them and they did look amazing for about one months before they started to loose their lustedr and sparkle.. two months later all the silver has been rubbed off and I don't even wear my wedding rings all day. Good for show but don't last long.
5,fantastic,very good product no flaws looks to good and very nice quality would buy more rings and things from this deler again thanks again
5,Beautiful and fun!,"I bought this for myself because I love the look of diamonds but I am not too excited about what some people have to go through in order to mine them. So, I thought I'd get some CZs. I have gotten SO many compliments on these rings. People think they're real, I'm assuming... Anyway, I got one as a gift for one of my ring's many admirers and she was thrilled. One of the rings does have larger stones, as previous reviewers have mentioned, but it doesn't bother me at all, especially considering the price. I just feel so fancy when I wear these. LOVE EM."
4,Very appealing,"I wasn't really sure what to expect of this set of 3 rings. However, it's a very appealing ring. I'm not sure if I could fool anyone that they're real diamonds but it's still very beautiful and I plan to wear it often."
4,reasonable price that ring not bad.,resonable price.No bad for private wearing.If you need to look better.Should make by used more weight of sterling silver.and bigger Cz.if the price is more expensive but i can affordable.for conclusion this ring good enough for private wearing and reasonable price
5,Awesome!! soooo worth buying!,"This ring is the bomb!!! I was lookin for something pretty I could wear everyday. My wedding band set is very expensive so I did not want to overuse it. I got this ring because it looks soooo much like my original wedding band and matches my eng ring. When I received the package (within 3 days), I was shocked how similar it looks. The cz is a great copy of the diamonds! I swear you cannot tell the difference unless u have it 1 inch from your eye and u stear at it for a while. I even wear this ring with my eng ring which has real diamonds and you really can't tell the difference. The only difference is th metal, my eng ring is 14k white gold which is obviously darker than this sterling silver. Anyhow, I'm very picky about my jewelery and I love the real stuff, but i do not mind wearing this at all!! Too bad they dont have half sizes, i'm 5.5 in ring size so I got the 6 and its a little loose."
5,STUNNING!!!,I just received these ring's today. Super fast shipping. They arrived in 5 days. I ordered this set based on others reviews. I was NOT disappointed! These are definitely more beautiful in person. I am using two of them as ring gards for a three stone princess cut ring I just ordered also. It looks SPECTACULAR. I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER.THIS LOOKS LIKE A VERY HIGH END PIECE!
2,Tarnished,"Not happy :( I was so excited for these, and I'm sure the rings would be wonderful if they weren't tarnished!! Not sure if they were just old stock or what, but they def didn't look new. I will prob just try to clean them up the best I can."
1,not like real thing,This look exactly what it is: CZ. Is NOT WAY for somebody to believe that is real.
1,WRONG ITEM,"DID NOT RECEIVE THE ITEM I ORDERED! VERY DISAPPOINTED IN AMAZON, AND I AM A REGULAR CUSTOMER! I RECEIVED A SINGLE ROW BAND. NOT STACKING!"
3,they're ok,"The rings are very cute. I personally do not think they look real, but then again you get what you pay for. I don't know if anyone else had this problem, but the CZ stones very easily come off. The first day I wore them, I lost 2 stones on each ring. That was disappointing."
2,Rough edges make it tough to wear,"I purchased these rings, to go with my gold rings, (to help make my gold rings, ""pop"" a little more with the white metal, without spending a fortune). I purchased them, to wear only two of them, on either side, of my real anniversary ring, and engagement ring. However, the stones are set in a way, that they dig into the fingers, next to the ring. Even when worn, with another two bands, (to help take the ""pressure"" off of the new bands), they still dug into my fingers, on both sides. I also found the rings, to be a bit larger, than a true size five. Don't get me wrong, they were pretty, very pretty. However, they were not worth being THAT uncomfortable."
1,Looks cheap,Shipping was very fast and came in a velvet pouch but don't waste your money. It looks cheap on and feels cheap. Very dissapoibted in this purchase.
4,Size matters,"Lovely piece of jewelry, BUT...What the photo doesn't clearly show is that one of the rings in this 3-ring set has larger stones than the other two. Not a big deal really, but I think there should be some clarification in the product description."
2,Loved it at first but just too uncomfortable!,"It sparkles and looks nice. I absolutely LOVE thicker bands so when I saw this, I had to try it. I loved having the option to wear all 3 or just 1. I wore it for a week then decided this had to go back. As much as I liked this, it was just too uncomfortable. The prongs stick out a lot and goes all the way around. It pokes the sides of the fingers next to it. I tried to deal with the discomfort but by the 5th or 6th day, I was soo ready to return it. Maybe this will work for someone who had really thin fingers but it was just too uncomfortable for me."
5,Good Product and Gr8 Customer Service,This was bought as a gift and the person I bought it for loved it very much so there you go. I brought a smile of a loved one's face for a relatively low price plus the customer service was gr8 this product as well...
5,Great!,I just got these rings for valentines day and I am so impressed. They sparkle beautifully and I don't find them uncomfortable at all. The top and bottom together make great ring guards and the three together are extremely beautiful as well. I am so happy with this set.
2,Looks like costume jewelry....FAKE,"I was looking for a replacement wedding band, not too expensive because I recently lost my real wedding band (so sad)! This ring is far from ""real"" looking. Its very sparkly but its just something about it, that looks unreal...hard to explain. I hate to return things, but I am returning this ring. This ring is good to compliment other costume type jewelry, but will never pass for ""real""."
4,"Nice ring but, BIG","The ring(s) are very pretty, sparkly and well made but...much too big to be worn together. They do not have the same look when worn seperately."
5,Sterling Silver CZ stacking eternity band rings,After 6 months these rings still have their shine and sparkle. Good bargain. Looks like little diamonds to me.
2,pretty but painful,"I returned these rings after wearing them for one full day. They look pretty, but have sharp poking edges all around the sides from the stones and their settings. Washing and drying my hands was so uncomfortable because of the rough feeling these rings had. I actually had 2 cuts on my middle finger from where it had pressed against the rings on my ring finger. I was disappointed, but had to return them. Its just not worth the pain!"
2,cheap,"I was looking for a costume set to go on either side of my engagement ring. After reading the reviews on these rings, I thought they might work. I was wrong. They are clearly costume when worn next to quality jewelry. They are also not all the same size. One of the bands was a bit wider than the others. All in all, I wasn't impressed enough to keep them to wear casually on their own. These were repackaged, and returned. Good luck ladies!"
5,"Beautiful, high quality!","I bought these stacking bands to wear in place of my engagement ring and wedding band for vacations and at the beach. I am used to my wedding set, which is absolutely stunning and full of sparkle, so i wasn't sure how I'd feel about wearing tiny cubic zirconiums. At least, I wanted to get sterling silver so this ""vacation set"" would not turn my skin green over time. Well, let me tell you - I am pleasantly surprised! These bands SPARKLE! To the untrained eye, they look like real diamonds. The craftmanship of the sterling silver seems to be pretty high-end, too. I ordered a size 6 (my regular wedding set is a custom-made size 5.75...but I have big knuckles) and they fit great! I am really happy with these."
5,Perfect,Beautful! Sized perfect. Middle band has slightly larger stones which is a plus in the total look. Don't think you will be disappointed if you purchase this. I know I've been real pleased with it.
4,"LIked it, a little flashy","Only had it for a few days, but like the look of it. Time will tell if it can hold up"
5,Love them,The stacking rings are absolutely beautiful and if they had them in emerald or black diamonds i would have already bought a set of each im going to look around amazon for them
4,Very pleased.,The band is bright and seems to be well made-I ordered this for granddaughter and she really likes it. She thinks it will stand up to here daily duties in hospital -wearing it instead of her wedding rings.
3,It's just okay.,"I bought this ring(s) hoping to love it, but it was *okay*. Maybe because I do own real diamonds, my eye is a bit to keen. I felt like it looked fake. The silver also seems to bright, which may have been what made it look fake the most. It wasn't SUPER bad, which is why I gave it 3 stars. If you're wearing for fun, then you should be happy. But, if you're wearing it to pass it off as the real thing or to try to impress someone--don't bother!"
5,Very nice!!!,I am very happy I ordered this ring. It is gorgeous! Do not hesitate to purchase it! I hope it doesn't fade:)!
5,myhats,Love the Eternity ring. Very pleased worth mSterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Stacking Eternity Bandsore than what it cost.
3,Stacking rings,"The rings are nice, but they are not that sparkly.... But other then that they were not too bad for the price...."
2,so disappointed,"I have triplet sisters, so I bought 4 of these rings as sister rings...and the pictures on here made them look so elegant. Then when I got all the rings, I was so disappointed. I am embarrassed to give the rings to my sisters."
3,pretty but not for long walks,Nice flip flop for social occassions but do not try walking all over town. I did and got big blisters!
2,"A mesmerizing, yet inaccurate, incomplete, and potentially harmful way of looking at archaelogy","Nice, fun, but superficial book which makes heroes of treasure hunters who destroyed half of the artifacts that they were digging for because of poor technique, put thousands of years old treasure around their wife's neck to take a picture, and secretly smuggled entire treasures out of the country where they were found (read: Schliemann). Does not mention scholars who built their work on other scholars' work but took all the credit. This would be a good book for a child under 12, but for anyone older than that, it is too much ""popular"" and not enough ""science"" and does make heroes out of antiheroes."
5,The origin of Indiana Jones,"This is the kind of book that never comes back when you lend it. Archeology is a serious subject, but this reads magically like a mystery novel. The domain of archeology has made gigantic steps since this book was first published, but it does not matter here: this is about how it all started. If you have not read it yet, or read it less than three times, you are very lucky: you are in for a great trip."
5,Exciting Music!,"Scott has again outdone himself! His music is inspirational and so full of life. It is impossible to sit still listening to this CD. Scott continues to grow musically and this music is daring. My favorite song on the album is ""Cuban Pete"" because it makes me want to dance! If you listen to a little of this Cd you will want to buy it for your friends and family. Thank you Scott for your integrity and creativity."
2,"Refreshing perspective, but obscurity overpowers message","Mary Louise Pratt has a lot of fresh and important things to say, but her writing style makes this book tough to read. I consider myself a good reader, I can usually pick out main ideas and meanings quite easily, but I found this book really frustratingly hard to read! Pratt flip-flops between a readable, clear style and one in which she employs almost indeciperable sentences. I think her message is really important and structurally, ""Imperial Eyes"" is smartly organized, but it takes a lot of patience and re-reading to understand it."
5,Love this!,"This collection offers a wide range of music from traditional (Come and I will sing you) to sweet (Graceful & Charming) to just plain fun (Mermaid, though it's not as good as the YouTube version! and Captain Kidd). The harmony and simplicity of the River Driver balances the fast pace (and, to me, tongue-twisting!) of Charlie Horse. All together, this cd is one of my favorites from GBS."
2,"lacking, and no direction","I found this book to be lacking and has no sense of direction to the plot. They don't explain the background of the Princess much. Princess and William seem to have a cold interaction, yet he claims he's in love with her, or could it be just in lust with her? The book gives the perspective mostly through William's point of view, but should also reflect the Princess to make their interaction and feelings towards each other more real. I think if the author wrote more of the background of the Princess within the story, then it would make the story more interesting. I've enjoyed most of Lois Greiman's books, but found this one needs improvement on a lot of areas. It was a dry reading for me."
4,Dark Tortured Souls Find Love,"I thought the book was good -- I like the mostly male perspective (although another reviewer was right in that a little more female perspective would've been better). This is a dark book -- the main characters were tortured, miserable people. In fact, all of the characters were tortured and miserable. I almost put the book down for the depression of it all. But I didn't because the writing was good, I wanted to know what happened next, and the story ended very well -- in fact, this ends the series of her 3 princess novels and draws everybody into its conclusion. I hope future books do not involve characters who hate themselves almost into suicide, though."
5,Where is this product?!?!?,"This was by far the best Hawaiian Tropic product the company produced. I know for a fact that there are many loyal users that have used this product for decades (myself and family included). For the company to discontinue a wonderful product with such a loyal user base is mind boggling to me. To make matters worse, the company now only produces the scented lotions which smell awful and do not hold tans or mostiourize as well. Bring this product back!!!!"
5,Bring back Hawaiian Tropic Aloe After SUN Moisturizer - Please,"For 30 years, Hawaiian Tropic's Aloe After SUN Moisturizer has been our family's ""lotion of choice"" for use YEAR-ROUND. It's the only moisturizing lotion we use. I even use it under makeup. We cannot/do not use products with a pungent fragrance . . . it's totally unnecessary for this product. Moisturizers with a fragrance (especially a pungent fragrance) usually irritate my eyes, but this product does not . . . even when I pat it on around the eye area! My family and I will not be purchasing your ""new, fragranced"" versions of Aloe After SUN Moisturizer. . .Bring back the ""original"" product that we now cannot find anywhere."
2,Beware the title,"This book is not all that the title implies. While there are many decent poems, essays, missives and the like from around the planet about the majesty of earth and life therein, mixed in are a lot of woe are we and the world is going to pot creations too. Alan Ginsberg was even featured in a diatribe. Alan Ginsberg and earth prayers? Give me a break. While overall this is not a bad book I think someone looking for inspirational daily messages would be well advised to go elsewhere or at least be prepared for a good bit of whining about the state of nature and man's part in the process."
3,Review for Earth Prayers,"Earth Prayers From around the World: 365 Prayers, Poems, and Invocations for Honoring the EarthWe are finding this book useful each week in our Mass readings and will continue to use it for reflection."
5,just what i was looking for,Ordered this for a Halloween costume and they worked perfectly. Sturdy and comfortable (I was in my costume for 12 hours) I would recommend this product
1,What a shame,"I paid $10.00 for the real moon boots over 10 years ago.I still wear them. They are perfect to slip on, for light outdoor work like shoveling snow and driving in the cold. I've been looking for another pair, and the closest I've gotten is a velcro moon boot by Itasca for $15.00 ."
1,Big Apple definition is wrong again,"The Big Apple definition in the book is wrong again. Other guide books have it right, but LET'S GO just doesn't care about accuracy."
4,A must have for beginners,This book is just what you need if you are beginning or need to learn the basic skills and shortcuts for Windows XP. I thought I knew a lot until I read and worked the lessons in this book at my own speed and at my own time.A handy reference for the layman and almost anyone who uses a computer.
3,Hefty but not as inclusive as claimed,"Has as a lot of useful information but is not as all inclusive as they claim.Not one word about how to handle .dll problems, for example."
3,Childrens Bible perhaps...,"I picked this book up because I was looking for details on Microsofts ""latest and greatest."" I have to admit I should have done more research.This book is probably suitable for someone new to windows(any flavor) and computers.It is full of basic information and is well written,however if you have no difficulties maneuvering in previous versions of Windows or consider yourself a poweruser...look elsewhere."
4,Good reference material,This is a great book for reference in general. It covers XP across the board and gives some good defenitions.I was impressed at how it gives you step by step instructions for installing all versions of XP. Including OEM versions on a new hard drive.It also explains some of the new technologies that Microsoft has incorporated into XP such as the NTFS file system.This book has helped me as a newbie to XP navigate my way around this new OS. I would buy this book if you are new to XP Home or Pro.
2,Good Book For Begineers,I bought this book thinking it would cover everything and anything about windows XP. I was wrong and it took me about the first ten pages to realize the book was going to cover only the very basics of XP. The book is mainly for begineers and does not go into the depths of windows XP. Do not buy the book if you have a basic understanding of windows XP. I would say that this book is for absolute begineers only.
5,Excellent!|,"From Planeta Journal - The Handbook looks better than ever. This new edition of the South America guide provides reliable information about general tourism as well profiles of national parks and reserves. Of special note is the ""Responsible Tourism"" essay that the book pioneered in 1992. This is a terrific guide. The format is easy to follow. Colorful pictures and maps compliment the text. Highly recommended."
3,So Amer HB 2000 vs. Lonely Planet So Amer on a Shoestring,"Against my better judgement, I bought the South American Handbook 2000 instead of Lonely Planet's South America on a Shoestring, based on several of the reviews on this website which gave the Handbook 2000 a much more favorable rating. The only problem is that unlike the Lonely Planet books, the handbook gives very little information about prices of lodging, restaurants,etc.which I feel is very important as prices vary a lot. So while the Handbook 2000 has some good information, South America on a Shoestring (or one of their country specific guides) is more essential especially when you are looking for a place to sleep at night. I personally don't use guidebooks to do most of my planning for my trips. But in a pinch when you get off the bus late at night in some strange city and you want to know what hotel to tell the taxi driver to take you, you can't beat the Lonely Planet series of Guidebooks."
4,Comparing Footprint,"This Footprint guide definitely compares to Lonely Planet. It is laid-out very well and easy to follow. The only thing I miss is the actual prices for accomodations. Even though they change quickly, it is a better way to make comparisons."
2,It doesn't have images!,"I bought this book to prepare myself for a trip to South America. I was very disappointed that this book does not contain any images at all.How are you going to decide which countries to visit if you can't really ""see"" what they have to offer?The book does contain a lot of information but it would be much better to have some pictures.I bought the Lonely Planet Guide of the countries I was mores interested, after this one and I am enjoying it much more. Also, Lonely Planet Guides are written by locals so you really get a lot of inside information."
5,Good Price and Delivering,"For me It was good service.That was the first time I ordered a book by internet, and the time it took for delivering was less than the indicated in the order confirmation, that's a good point to consider 'cause I was expecting the book before my vacations trip begin and it arrived just on time, even a little before =)Indeed, the price for the book (plus shipping and handling) was really good, keep going with the special offers and discounts!!!Thanks for a good delivering and price!!!"
5,VERY (all most too) Comprehensive!,"Footprint's guide to South America is pretty great. The key word, here, is ""thorough"" -- almost too thorough. It's a dense brick of a book that will be impossible to travel with, but I'll make photocopies of the relevant sections and be OK. It quite literally has everything the curious traveler wants to know about South America. The parts on Chile and Argentina are dead-on; parts on Brazil need a little refreshing (just because Brazil is so dynamic and always changing)."
4,Whew!,"This volume contains so much more information than I can use, that it is a bit overwhelming. I use it as a cross check on Fodor's South America. I do, however, recommend it for the amount of information it contains....a good cross reference."
1,no answer key,"Here's what Customer Service at Pearson/Prentice Hall had to say when I inquired about the answer key for this workbook: ""We do apologize the answer key is in the Teachers Resource Kit only and not sold separately. The Teacher resource is 0130375675 - PH Advanced Algebra Teacher Resource Kit 3/e 2004c...$199.97"".Not helpful. Without the answers, this book is worthless for extra practice."
1,Isbn 0131339982,"How annoying... No solution manual or even answer key... This cuts out any desire of being productive in your work. A student, even good student, is at teacher's mearsy every time s/he takes the initiative to do the work.What is the use of doing math on your own if you don't know when done correctly and what your mistakes are?Very discouraging. We are looking at Saxon Math instead. Solution Manual IS available AND sold separately, which makes the whole set very user-friendly. Half the volume with less fu-fu's, very much to the point. Came recommended by our teacher. I am thankful!"
3,Confusing,"The title made me think that there was additional practice for every lesson in addition to lessons. The actual book doesn't have an answer key, so you're forced to buy it with everything else. There aren't even any examples!"
4,A Pantheon of Passion,"Agapi's book is both inspiring and informative. Having studied mythology for many years, I found new fun aspects of the gods and goddesses to contemplate and perhaps even to incorporate. Desire, love, and passion are marvelously complex; Agapi's approach offers useful tools of awareness for self and others, plus ways to enhance and enrich the heavenly experience of being In Love. It's my new favourite gift for birthdays, engagements, and weddings."
1,Disc contents does not match label or box,"Like another reviewer, I have purchased this disk set and been disheartened to find the contents of the discs do not match the labels. The ""Mammals of North America"" set is masquerading as ""Dangerous Encounters"". Even worse, I have now returned this set once for replacement, and received a SECOND erroneous set of discs. It's the manufacturer's fault. They should have a recall on their website. There's not much the vendors can do."
5,Hawaii Revealed,This is a great in-depth book of all the best there is on the Big Island! There is alot of information with complete details on finding everything there. I would highly recommend getting this book for anyone wanting to visit the Big Island!
2,The Best,"The best out of three guide books I looked at, and a must for the first trip to the big island."
5,Big Island guide book,Purchased this guide book for our trip to the Big Island of Hawaii and found it to be extremely helpful!!
5,Don't Leave Home Without It,"This is the absolute best book on Hawaii that I have ever read, and I have read many. There is a very good balance with photos and commentary, and though the descriptions are not always lengthy - that is to be expected getting in as many attractions as they do. I have taken it with me the last four trips to the big island, and I discover something new every time.I would never have discovered the green sand beach on my own, and it is my favorite now. It takes a hike to get there, but it is worth it! I found several remote beaches that I would never have known about without this book.One word of warning..... when the book states a site is hard to get to and you will rarely see any other people there, believe it. I had a very lonely nervous drive out to South Point."
1,Not so effective light,this product was suppose to be black but was silver and the intensity of the light is not good or may be too bad...waste of 5$
4,Inexpensive Multimeter,"A lot of features for the money, nice carrying case. English problems in the manual and descriptions - could have used some editing from an English-speaking person. I used a RS232 to USB converter cable on the PC output and it made PC hook-up painless. I bought that from Tiger Direct."
2,Someone Please Shorten This Book,"I don't know how many more books like this I can read. Except for the examples, its very high level. At least half the book is allocated to middle management-esque writing regarding how the best way to manage ""enterprize systems."" There is some good information here, but it seems a little too Politically Correct to my tastes. I have not seen a data center that actually operates as the book describes. Also, the author has a relationship with Veritas, so how many of Vertitas' shortcomings can we expect from a book like this? The entire manuscript would have to have passed through Veritas' legal and PR department before getting anywhere near the publisher. So much for getting the real story. As far as alternatives, if the reader is looking for corporate/unix information, Unix Backup and Recovery for UNIX is the way to go. For PC users, you can't beat How to Backup Your Windows Computer. Really, there are very few titles in this area."
1,implementing backup and recovery,"I thought the book was a waste of money. It is for the absolute beginner, nothing of value beyond that. I would say you have more chance of learning something from blogs about storage."
4,Well organized and worth the reading,"Vertical applications, such this backup software, often comes with bare documents or none at all. So it is frustrating to go screen after screen trying to understand how it works.""Implementing Backup and Recovery"" is not a techonology book, not a general book on backups and security procedures, but a full manual to Veritas software. However, the way the book is developed it will help you not only to put Veritas on service, but to understand certain secururity issues and create your backup policies.An easy to read and well written book that will demand an aditional read of newer PDFs to apply to more updated versions of the software, but still a good reading."
3,not that useful. not good at all for netbackup.,"not that useful in real life. not good at all for netbackup.however, it is good for ""general knowledge"" about backup.really good for calculating capacity etc."
5,Very Interesting - Excellent!,"Mr. George being described as a conservative really turned me off. I certainly wasn't going to waste my time reading what some [...], opportunist wrote. However, since I first became aware of him in ""Dark Matters"", a book of African American speculative fiction, I thought I would throw caution to the wind and give him a try. I am glad I did. I absolutely loved this book. He deserves to be better known. I am now reading all of his books. I highly recommend this author. Black No More is my next read, which was featured in Dark Matters. I am looking forward to it."
4,Better than expected,"Usually when they tell you something will arrive within 14 days, it arrives on the 14th day. Not so with Better World Books. My copy of ""Black Empire"" arrived in less than a week (BWB, the guys at the Mishawaka warehouse are safe; howevere, if you've already started the torture process on them for not giving 108.8% satisfaction, it might be a good time to begin the cover-up -- inside joke, of course).The copy I received was in very good condition, though it did have a few dog ears and some highlights (both of which were mentioned in the book's online description).I was very pleased with the service and I would use BWB again."
5,Superb stompin rocking Celtic music,"This CD was everythng the band promised and more. If you like the upbeat style of Celtic music, you'll love this. Original lyrics well matched to some old and some new tunes. Well recommended, if you're into such bands as Alias Ron Kavana, Skin The Peeler, Mara, Fling, Wolfstone, Capercailie (possibly The Pogues ?)"
4,Beware!!!!!,"If you decide to buy this CD, be forewarned...you will want to listen to it over and over and over! I would have bought the whole CD just for the title song, but the rest of the music is fabulous as well. The Paperboys deliver!!"
5,LOVE GONE WRONG,"Based unofficially on the then-Lana Turner/Johnny Stompanato trial that involved a knife and the daughter of the late movie star, this sordid tale follows the same track-type puzzling murder, but goes once step further by including the omitted denouement thought by all regarding the real-life case. Protagonist Luke Lurey is the ex-husband caught in the middle, whose ever-present guidance helps put the pieces back together. And what wicked pieces they end up being. Just like any scandal sheet type magazine of the time, this Harold Robbins offering is pulp fiction at its best. With its effervescent plot scheme and narratively swinging point of view, this ""fictional"" delivery by the man who once has been hailed as a master storyteller is one addictive read that surely will please fans of the melodrama, and that, despite the toned-down sex scenes of its time (1962).-----Martin Boucher"
2,"Systems Theory shifts ""blame"" to community","This book advances a theory of conflict management called ""systems theory."" At the core of this theory is the concept that individuals in the congregation are not responsible or accountable for their aberrant behavior. The fault lies in how the community interacts within itself, the unwritten rules it has established, and the secret games it plays. To improve a conflicted congregation, one must fix the system and not confront any individual.Sadly lacking are biblical references that either support the ""systems theory"" approach to conflict management or show ""systems theory"" in use by God. In fact, a systems approach to conflict resolution is at odds with revealed Scripture, since Scripture places individuals on the hotseat for repentance, resolving their personal disputes, and making restitution.Assuming you value biblical methods for dealing with life, pick up a copy of Ken Sande's ""The Peacemaker"" instead."
1,Zero Stars,This book was a waste of money. It was irrelevant straying far away from Biblical and concrete conflict resolution practices. Don't waste your money to read trivial church stories.
1,Church Conflict: The Hidden Systems Behind the Fights,This book is very boring and I feel that it is a stupid way to look at the church and to try to settle conflicts. I did not like it and I do not recommend anyone purchase it unless you necessaryly have to for a class like I did.
3,Beowulf,"Hey, the story is timeless and the illustrations are fantastic. You will love this book. For all ages but a great intro for the HS student facing the text for the first time."
2,The Collected Beowulf,"First, the binding on the book was coming apart. And, I wish the seller would have stated that the font was difficult to read not only because of the font type but because the colors ""blend"" on the page which makes it difficult to read."
5,High Quality and Effective,"My daughter takes 20 of these a day to control her acne. It works amazingly well. She is much clearer than her dermatologist can get her, and she doesn't have to take all those harmful antibiotics. BTW, there are zero side effects with vitamin B5 that we can see. She tried NOW brand for a couple of months, in my effort to drive down the cost, but she broke out terribly. I don't know why, but Vitamin shoppe just has a higher quality vitamin."
5,Transformers Armada Best Of The Autobots,This is a awesome show and this dvd has some pretty good episodes on it. if you want to see a full seasons get or rent from netflix season 1 part 1 and season 1 part 2. if you have not seen this show then i recommend you do
2,sigh,"these episodes are way out of order and don't make since,If you are an older gen1 fan and must get this series wait for the box set because at least the episodes will be in order.armada was a pitiful cartoon with so many mistakes it's pitiful,for example just about every episode has someone calling another character by the wrong name or they reuse the same animation over and over again,in fact some animation just has the mouth moving but nothing else moves,and those kids are annoying,you have a fat kid you complains all the time about how hungry he is and you have a mexican kid who is so stereotypical that it's not funny,alexis is the female and she tries to boss the autobots around like she knows everything,rad is the only normal kid but he's still in it way too much in fact...SPOILERS.............he saves the universe at the end of the series,I guess we didn't need the autobots after all...."
1,Too Much Trouble To Use!,"I just got a small dog after falling in love with my friend's small dog of the same breed. My friend trained her dog on puppy pads, and had a plastic frame that held the pad in place. I couldn't find her particular frame in a store here in California, so purchased this frame. The problem with this one is that you have to take four pieces apart EVERY time you replace the pad and then put the entire frame back together. It's a major pain. I ended up buying a second frame from Amazon.com (via KV Vet Supply) by ""Nothing Like It"" Designs. The top frame piece is a single piece, and picks up easily when you have to change pads. I like the single piece frame so much better!"
1,Do NOT buy this puppy pad holder!,THIS THING IS EIGHT PLASTIC PIECES OF JUNK. Does it really have any purpose at all? I didn't bother returning it because it would cost more to ship and luckily did not lose my shirt on this thing. I left it out in the recycling for someone to take it. It does not hold together well and has to be taken apart each time. The pieces do not fit together well at all.DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!
3,"Works, but cumbersome","The Puppy Pad Holder works, but is a bit cumbersome and isn't the easiest pad holder to use. You have to disassemble the four bars on top that hold the pad to the assembled four parts on the bottom, then reassemble. This is not as convenient as I would prefer. It does work, however, and it seems to better define that potty area for my dogs. Its small size works well and fits nicely behind a chair. Cheap pads readily available at WalMart fit perfectly."
2,Pain in the arse,"Although it does stop my border terrier from shredding the pads, this holder is a complete pain in the arse to use. You have to disassemble the four piece frame every time and I have found this very cumbersome and time consuming. Now having to buy an all-in-one."
1,Simple Solution Puppy Pad Holder,"I can see why this thing is cheaper than other products with a similar function - this one is junk.As others mentioned, it is in 8 pieces, 4 top & 4 bottom - I suppose so they could ship it easier/cheaper.Problem is that every time you have to change a pad, the top has to completely come apart & most of the time part of the bottom falls apart also. And with my puppy, she still shreds the pee pee pads. I bought mine in a pet store. I would recommend that a prospective buyer may want to spend a little more, and get a better product."
5,Wonderful service & great product,The shipping was quick. The customer service was wonderful. The product was as advertised. I would buy from again. Thanks.
2,Monodimensional characters kill an otherwise decent book,"The plot is a sort of mystery, decently realized. The fact that it's entwined with WWI makes it somewhat novel (forgive me).But the flatly drawn characters all but kill the story. There's little growth, little development -- for all their experiences, all the characters seem to remain the same as when they were first introduced in the novel. And what's worse, the lead character is almost saccarine sweet -- so much sentimentality!The writing itself is decent, but not good enough to overcome the poor characterization and the sentimentality.Great literature it is not."
5,"Before Amalie, there was Mathilde...","It is a shame that I saw ""Amalie"" before reading this book. Though I loved the movie, I kept seeing that actress as the main character of this book. And though there are some similarities in personality, Mathilde exposes herself to our examination far more deeply than Amalie did.Many books have been written about missing fiances, missing lovers, war widows. This book takes those stories and binds them into a gripping mystery. This novel is NOT a tear-jerker and for that alone, it is wonderful. It is a novel about strength and love and a wish for what could have been. It is about who you would want to be if your lover was lost in the war. I will be buying this book for my mother and my best friends. It is something different. I loved it."
4,An Unusual Love Story,"This was a rare, intelligent, beautiful love story . It is particularly deft in its handling of the war scenes. It was the perfect balance between mystery, historic fact and clever story telling."
2,much ado about little,"Two people whose opinions I respect recommended this book to me - one even said it was the best book she had ever read, and she is a mature, intelligent and serious reader. So I approached the book with great anticipation. Sadly, after an interesting beginning, the book became quite tedious. Ultimately I finished it just so I could get it done with, not because I was enjoying it . Some prior reviewers have blamed the translation but the problem lies in the story itself. There is a very linear simple and obvious plot which is made overly complicated by a plethora of ancillary inessential characters and confusing twists and turns which are impossible to keep straight. In addition there is no character development - the characters are drawn once (very simply and always sentimentally) and never change, and are drawn with thick crayon at that. The depiction of WWI was well done, but other than that it is not a book I would recommend."
5,Took my breath away,"I hardly know how to describe this book. Saying ""I couldn't put it down"" is not sufficient. It is different, unlike any book I have read. The plot was intriguing and the writing exquisite. Don't miss it."
3,The Engagement Was Too Long,"As a translation, the text has that awkward charm that occurs when phrases are not quite equivalent. I tend to like that stilted flavor. The author's use of present tense verbs in describing the action was also interesting. The plot itself was quite simple. The opening descriptions of the five condemned men and the surreal horror of WWI was the best part of the book. The conclusion also grabbed the reader's attention as it offerd a resolution to the question of the plot. The middle of the book, however, dragged. How long can a person write letters, ask questions, and talk about a missing lover before getting tedious? I have mixed feelings about the whole impression made by the book and probably would have liked it better as a condensation."
1,Not a very good book,"I'm amazed at how many people loved this book. I did not enjoy it at all and only finished it because it was a book club choice. I thought the writing was poor and confusing (maybe something was lost in the translation), the characters were dull, and the story was draggy and boring. This is the first book in a long time that I disliked so much."
5,Very engaging mystery,"I love the book. I couldn't wait to see the movie. I must admit the movie fell flat. Don't waste your time with movie, but definitely read the novel. It is set during and just after WWI. Wheelchair-bound Mathilde Donnay is told that her fiancé has died honorably during the war. She notices discrepancies in the official story and is convinced that her fiancé is still alive. This is a love story set in a historical setting, but what I loved about the novel was the mystery or I should say mysteries because there are several in this novel that Mathilde must solve. I really admired Mathilde's tenacity to find the truth about her fiancé. The twists and turns this story took while investigating her fiancés whereabouts and the mysteries that are discovered and solved during this time really keep you guessing about what actually happened to her fiancé right up to the end of the novel. I read this novel in 2 days, something I haven't done in quite some time."
4,Complicated,"This is an excellent book. Its greatest strength is the main character Mathilde. She is a complex, three-dimensional character who is believable and interesting. At times maddening, you still can't help but like and admire her.The plot is a kind of mystery which does make for compelling reading. However, since it incorporates so many different stories, story lines, and characters it becomes needlessly complicated at times and, yes, might even strain your patience.Still, after reading this book I now want to see the movie to see how the director approached this ultra-complex story."
2,A terrible translation - read it in French I guess,"The translation was very choppy. Sentence structure was of an odd cadence that was hard to follow. I had a really hard time with the translation in general -it was too vague. I am still not sure how the book ended! How sad!The heroine is SPOILED rotten, and I felt NO sympathy for her. Poor little rich girl. She had too much time on her hands and used her wealthy Daddy's money to pursue her curiosity.... hurting others while she was at it! How selfish!The other characters were very real, but nonetheless boring. Eskimo could have been interesting, but the plot was so confusing who knows?!"
2,Sounds Great but LIMITED Lifespan,"The sound performance out of this system is pretty good. Like you'd expect, there are no mids but the subwoofer is excellent and the system runs relatively efficently. Excellent for PC use when matched with an appropriate sound card.However, there is a cronic problem with this system. The internal components have no air flow what so ever and the system will blow varistors and mosfets, which is cheap to repair if you're an electrician but Creative will charge in excess of $300 to do so. This affects ALL systems. Don't take my word on it, google the problem for yourself.Thus, I cannot recommend these speakers to anyone."
2,Scattered and unorganized,"I looked forward to reading this book and learning a lot about what inspired Walt Whitman, hoping to discover what made him the representative poet of America. But the information is poorly presented. I found myself craving some sort of context, an axis. The author relies far too much on quotes from WW's books and letters to fill the page, rather than using those sources to back up some sort of theory. In short, this is a badly written sophomore English paper. There is no logical progression of his age/place/time and WW's writing. We learn that WW updated and reissued ""Leaves of Grass"" numerous times, but what informed those changes, for example? The text jumps from one year to another, but the reader is never quite sure where he is in the ""story."" It's a lot of disjointed notes and snippets that result in a fractured and unbalanced account of WW's life. I wish I'd started with a different WW biography."
1,Failure... to love those with whom you disagree,"This book is only worth one star, or even half. While the authors make a few thought-provoking arguments, these are obscured by the book's snide tone, sarcasm, and name-calling. How seriously can you take what it says, when, for example, one essay likens openness theologians to drag queens? This book is only fit for those who are convinced that the rightness of their doctrine exempts them from the command to love. Any Christian who is trying to make a serious assesment of open theism's claims would be well-advised to look elsewhere."
3,Does its job !,This little guy works good! The only complains that I have are on the distance. Sometimes had to get really close to the door before it actually worked ! Overall a decent unit.
3,"Nice and Compact, but slow","This remote is a good product and delivers as promised, but it takes 3-4 seconds before it opens the garage door after you press the button. Not a very long range remote either."
4,"Not everything, but still good","This book is pretty good, but it doesn't cover everything. No German or Prussian history- scant mention of Peter the Great. But the strategies and practice questions are good. Use this one for the tests and practice questions and get the Barrons version for studying."
4,Pretty Good,"This is a pretty good book, but it leaves out some important things. It is good if you had a bad teacher or something and you're starting from ground zero, but there's not enough detail- I thought there was too much emphasis on test taking techniques and not enough on the history you need to know. I would get it again, but review with other study guides too- I recommend finding a study guide that accompanies your textbook. I got a 4 using about 5 different sources to study. Good Luck those of you taking the exam!"
4,Excellent review for exam,This book gives a concise view of what you need to know for the exam. Excellent tips for cracking the exam - lots of humor too which makes it very easy to read. Very good review if you already know your history and need to review for the exam.
1,do not buy not what your paying for!!!!!,"Well like the title says, dont buy this item you think your paying for a mixer and it turns out to be a speaker coil this ad is no good. DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY!!!"
4,Jamela's Dress,"""Just one more time"" are the words uttered by my two year old after we finish reading about ""Kwela Jamela African Queen"". Jamela's Dress is a unique representation of the simple joys in a child's life and how imagination can sometimes lead to trouble. Niki Daly's illustrations are a brilliant use of color that not only are appealing to the eye but also represent that of the African culture. This is definately a story that ties in a silly sence of children's adventure with a mother-daughter bond and cultural richness."
4,Jamela's Dress,"Jamela's Dress celebrates the youthful spirit of Jamela, a young South African girl. Jamela and her Mama shop for some material with which her mother will make a new dress to be worn on the occasion of a family wedding. They take it home, wash it, and hang it up to dry. As Jamela guards it against harm she becomes so excited by the beauty of the cloth that she wraps it about herself and parades through the town. Inevitably the cloth is ruined but through a clever plot device all turns out well and Jamela redeems herself. The wonderfully warm watercolors bring Jamela's neighborhood to life in all its energy and drama. An author's note traces the changing meaning of the word ""kwela"" through the changing history of his country and so illuminating some of the reasons new South Africa may have to exhibit a youthful spirit similar to Jamela's.For children from three to six."
4,Joyful book,This book is fun to read and it has a lot of good messages. The colorful illustrations playfully draw the reader into the daily life of this South African community. The little protagonist of the story gets herself into trouble but then the problem is resolved with an almost magical solution. Perhaps it's not the most perfect message but overall I like the book a great deal and so does my daughter.
2,Not pleased,"Was a little dissapointed in the product, not as big as it seems in the picture and not as high quality as some of the other attachments we have purchased."
2,Contains PARABENS,"You wouldn't think that an expensive baby skin product would contain cancer causing substances, but this does! It was a gift from good friends and used it for a week before reading all the ingredients. I was moderately satisfied until that point - OK cleansing power, interesting light foam, nice fragrance. Too bad about the toxic ingredients."
5,Engineers create a new sound,"The Engineers debut album has shares similarities in sound to that of other bands, such as Air, Sigur Ros, and even shades of Pink Floyd (more remiscent of the Wall). Much of the album consists of an ethereal and melancholic sound. The album also reveals many layers of sound that creates a wall of energy. It's a great debut by this band from Manchester and should catch on quickly."
3,Not All It Promised To Be...,"I purchased this CD based on an Amazon recommendation. The formula seemed conducive to something I would really, really like. I do admit this is a good album but it lacks something that I can't quite put my finger on. I would definitely point to comtemporaries such as AU4 and, more importantly, the very strong and fleshed out album ""Love And Distance"" by The Helio Sequence as alternatives. I won't shelf this album for good...I'll give it a chance...but my first impression is that there are a lot better albums out there in this same vein."
4,Shock of the New,"In today's music climate, where everything ""new"" is really re-cycled from old spare parts, it's very hard to create something truly different and original, but Manchester's ENGINEERS have done just that - at turns understated, sumptuous, and haunting, ENGINEERS have created a lush sonic soundscape that recalls past influences, yet carves out a new niche on their own - quite a feat, and quite a debut longplayer. This is a definite keeper that compells on to press ""Repeat"" on the CD shuffler - won't you try it?"
3,"Thank U Guys, But We Already Have AIR","Ovo je svakako mogao da bude jedan od najboljih albuma 2005. da momci nelice toliko na Air i nesto manje na Flaming Lips. Generalno, ovo je dobar album kojem jedino nedostaje mastovitost i orginalnost, tako da i odlicne pesme kao sto su Home i Forgfivness ostavljaju za sobom znak upitnika u vazduhu.Steta, nadam se da ce sledeci album biti mnogo kreativniji"
4,"Good, but no reinvention of the wheel","To preface my entire critique, I should say that this album is excellent.However, Engineers are not doing anything new here. Since I purchased this record, countless comparisons have come to mind: Boards of Canada meets Crosby Stills and Nash; The Beta Band meets Mum; Trent Reznor meets A near lethal dose of Thorazine, and so on... This is not a groundbreaking work that will forever change music. It is, however, something that would greatly benefit any music collection.Best Tracks:Track 6Track 9Well worth the money I paid for it, even if its only purpose is to emulate the better aspects of excellent contemporary groups."
4,Mellow electronica,"This is a very relaxed album, versatile enough for background music during a dinner party or with a set of headphones at night. Contrary to some, I wouldn't call this experimental, as it's far too polished for that definition. The more you listen to Engineer's album you hear different elements occurring, it's a little reminiscent, thematically speaking of bits of the Radiohead ""OK Computer"" album combined with a folk music sensitivity like Kings of Convenience. Nowadays it's not that common to hear something that really sounds different enough to listen right through from start to finish but The Engineers do it well. Looking forward to their next output."
4,"Kind of tight, but feels safe","I really like the design of this helmet, it is round but doesn't make your head look like a ball. The visor clips in really solidly and doesn't easily clip off, I have had issues with this with other helmets. The red color looks really really nice, I am a big fan. Sadly the chin strap does not have a clip on the end, so the extra fabric just hangs there. The helmet is a bit tighter than other medium helmets. I even got a sizing chart from the company and it still doesn't fit to the measurements that well."
5,I'd give it 4.5...,"Great value. Comfortable. Runs a bit small considering it's a medium.A little crackly and crunchy when bent, clearly of not the highest qualitySame goes for the inside, but it is plenty comfortable.I bought it as my first helmet, but also considering that I would probably make it a spare in the future. For now, it works, and I use it on my moped.Most people say you should spend at least 400 dollars on a helmet because it is your head. I'm confident this helmet would do just as well of a job as a 500 dollar helmet in 99% of scenarios. That one percent could mean your life... but I guess that makes me a gambler."
4,Raptor Open Face Helmet,I ride bikes from the 70's and prefer the old school look. The color (Red) is a real close match to my 1975 Honda CB400F. The finish on the helmet is very good. I bought a medium for my wife and a large for me. It seems a little tight but I can already tell the padding is settling in to fit the shape of my head. Can't beat it for the price.
4,pleasant colour & very soft,"The crib sheet came in nice solid colours and I loved the texture of knit. Overall, a very nice purchase. Only problem was that the size was a little off. Sort of longish and due to the stretchy nature of knit, I had quite a bit of extra fabric to smooth down to the sides. I also wished that the sheet was a just a bit thicker."
3,Nice and Soft for Baby but Stretched Too Big,I have three of these sheets in assorted colors. I bought knit sheets after hearing that they were easier to change. The sheets have washed well - no fraying - but two of the three seem to have stretched out and have to be tucked in at the ends. The friction with the mattress pad seems to help keep it in place and I have not had any problems with them coming up but I am disappointed that they stretched out. The material seems very comfortable and gets softer each time I wash them.
3,Helpful book for non-Mormons,"This book provides a quick and helpful summary of the beliefs of the Mormon Church, presented for non-Mormons. It seems to be not interested in convincing you to join the church, but in informing you about the church. As a non-Mormon recently moved to Salt Lake City, I found it very interesting and valuable"
2,Look Closely,"As a non-mormon looking to increase my knowledge of Mormonism, I was disappointed. Like other works by Mormons I have read,the Bible references were taken totally out of context when they refered to the subject at all. Most of the unusual Mormon practices were not justified with references to the Bible. This work uses words not in any dictionary and known only to Mormons, see in particular the pages on the three levels of heaven. Mr. Lee does not have enough knowledge of the Bible or Christian theology to understand the message of the New Testament. For this reason he claims Mormons are just another Protestant sect. This work displays clearly how different Mormons are from Christians. Read this with the Bible in one hand and ""What Do Mormons Really Believe"" in the other."
1,You'll like this book if you're a woman-hater,"Cathy Young, another woman whose making money from the trials & tribulations of other women. Don't give her the satisfaction! Read women of intelligence instead, & abstain from this tripe!"
1,Yet another man-pleaser,"Why doesn't Amazon have an option for Zero Stars? Because that's what this nonsense deserves. Save your money. All you have to do if you want to hear what she has to say in this book is talk to any high-heeled, eyelash-batting twit who ignores solid research and goes on trying to please abusive men. She is one of the prime examples of why men feel entitled to their misogyny. Hey, if women are against other women, why shouldn't men be? Suggestions for EXCELLENT books are: ""Speaking of Sex: The Denial of Gender Inequality"" by Deborah Rhode, ""Who's Afraid of Feminism?"" by Juliet Mitchell, & ""The Feminist Memoir Project"" by Rachel Blau DuPlessis and Ann Shapiro (Eds)."
5,With Power Comes Responsibility,"Cathy Young defends women's right to be bad, to do bad things, to be wrong, to be violent - and to accept the responsibility for such actions. Who would want these rights? Well, today's women should want them - they are the right to be fully human. Common wisdom, fed by advocacy groups (as Young so skilfully delineates), gives us two images of women: 1) the forbearing and sensitive nun, easily offended by the slightest hint of sex or physical confrontation, and 2) the ""woman warrior"" - infinitely capable and contemptuous of men. If women commit violent acts (and, as Young proves beyond doubt, they commit these acts regularly) it must be in self-defense (the media and the Ad Council tell us). Young's idea is revolutionary and could get us out of the Edwardian simplicities of our current dogma - that men are predators and women are pure and innocent. Women are human, capable of evil, and deserve the right to be held responsible when they do wrong. Now that's equality."
4,Sheesh.,"Reading some of the other reviews for this book has reminded me of the complete absence of anything resembling rational thought found in the majority of humans, particularly those of the stubborn, ideological variety that are sometimes termed 'opinionated'. When someone is lambasted by nutty extremists on both 'sides', that person is usually doing something right. Though in this case the two 'sides' (i.e., 'difference feminism' and male chauvinism) have more in common with each other than they do with anything promoted by Young, this certainly holds true for her."
1,A Grave Disappointment,"To say that the synopsis written by this book's publisher and other reviewers is just hype would be a big understatement. I guess none of these people actually read this dribble. I was looking forward to reading something intelligent, but Young's understanding (or should I say misunderstanding) of the issues is at the 6th grade level."
1,Written by a woman-to-man transexual,The only thing empowering about this blather is that it seems males are now writing under female pseudonyms (as in Cathy Young)
1,In a word...,"To say this book is stupid is to give it a syllable too many. But hey, I'm feeling generous."
1,Can I please have my money back?,"The least I could get is my money back, since my wasted time in reading this tripe cannot be returned."
1,Literary Dung,What can you do when someone is blowing piffle chunks? Hold your nose & get the hell out of the way! I threw my copy of this book out.
5,A blueprint for true equality,"I have already written a review for Christina Hoff Sommer's book, ""Who Stole Feminism"" and it is my pleasure to write another one for Cathy Young. After taking a mandatory women's studies course at my university, and learning about bizarre theories that blatantly pit all men as sociopaths, Young's intelligent, fact-backed, book is something that is truly needed. As Young and Sommers have said, changing the knowledge base of our institutions is not the answer to achieving true equality of the sexes--we need to both take hold of the level playing field we now have and forge together to further form and then take a advantage of a world where NEITHER gender is depicted as inferior. It is not remotely surprising to me that some of the reviewers on this page have resorted to calling Young a ""transexual"" or her book ""doo doo"". What else can they say when truth and progress lie on the other side of the battlefield."
4,The Doctor's Dance,"The author doesn't fit my image of a witch doctor but he does a dance and the dance changes to the tune of the times, places and circumstances of his practice. From medical school high jinx to internship struggles through rural house calls in Appalachia, the author reluctantly makes his way to the specialized, technological but defensive embodiment of modern medical practice.This is a collection of stories and anecdotes that happen under the different circumstances of a long and varied medical career. The book is admittedly a mixture of incidents that happened to him personally along with others that he has heard about. However, it is written in such a way that the reader tends to forget that as the story flows through his career.Humorous, enlightening, easy reading and absorbing sum up my appraisal of this book."
3,"Fits great, sounds ok.","The exhaust fit great and was very easy to install myself. BUT it has a hum when you are feathering the gas and not accelerating very fast. Under a heavy load it sounds awesome, its just under a light load. The price is hard to beat and I dont know if I would install this system again if not for the low price."
5,Gibson 7100,Direct fit on my 05 Tundra. Love the new look and the sound. Only took about an hour for me to install myself.
4,Must have for using vellum in scrapbook...,"I used acid free adhesive for vellum quotes on a scrapbook page, and I could see the tape/adhesive through the vellum--had to be re-done. Once I researched the problem, I discovered the tape especially made for vellum. It works perfectly--just a bit icky to use--stringy!"
1,difficult to use,"I bought this specifically to make memorial candles. I found it very difficult to use. It does not come out of the dispenser easily and when I finally got a small piece of it on the paper it didn't ""glue the ends of the vellum together very well. I had excellent results just using generic double stick tape. It was a waste of money."
5,Vellum Tape,This is very good tape. It works well and looks very good. I am very pleased with it and would buy it again.
1,DVD does not work,"My DVD does not play. It displays the name of the company and gets stuck after that. I did not play the DVD in the first 30 days after my purchase, and now I cannot even return it for the full price."
5,?,"There is a tune, which is played when Fiona decided with their cousin to clean the houses in the island.in DVD they call Cleaning day 1 2 3"
5,"My daughter (7 yrs old) calls them her ""babies""","When my daughter was 3 we got her the gray rabbit.She carried him everywhere! She named him ""Stinky"" and slept with him every night.Stinky is still in great condition for being loved so much! Then we got her the white one. She carried ""Snowball"" under her left arm since the right was reserved for Stinky. Then we bought the brown rabbit. ""Butterscotch"" also joined the ranks on her pillow every night. Then ""Fluffy"" (Tan) and ""Cow Bunny"" (Black and White) came to live with us. She still sleeps with all of them. Before school she covers them up in bed and kisses them goodbye. I think any child that likes stuffed animals would fall in love with these rabbits. They're so soft,durable,and fit perfectly under your arm!...Snowball is no longer white...but in great condition...I came to this site specifically to compliment Animal Alley--Don't discontinue the bunnies!!!!"
5,Adorable!!!,I just got this guy and i've already fallen in love! He is so cuddly and is a great sleeping and hanging out buddy!!!!!!!!!!!
3,limited comparative approach,"Suzuki basically has written this book, which primarily about Buddhism rather than Christianity, as a way of drawing connections between the different mysticisms present in Christian tradition and how some of these mysticisms share common traits and insights with Buddhism. Not surprisingly, the mystic whom he chooses to do this with is almost exclusively Meister Eckhart. This is, thus, no comparative history but a Buddhist slant on Eckchart's thought and spirituality. It is a slant that might make some Christians uncomfortable but it is interesting nonetheless. This serves a window through which he continues to discussion Buddhist mysticism at large in the rest of the book."
5,This can be the key to open your door,"In a way that is neither condescending or patronizing Denis outlines what he believes to be 10 attributes, or seeds, that can lead to a fulfilling life. He draws on his own life's experiences and truly gets you feeling pumped. He allows for introspection at the end of each chapter that let's you do some true soul searching. A true 5 star performance that will appeal to those readers new to philosophy/self help or seasoned vets. I will certainly read more of Waitley's work."
5,Highly Recommended ! ! !,"Dr. Waitley reminds us of a truth his grandmother told him, ""things don't matter as much as your attitude toward them."" This book helps you to gain and sustain the attitude that results in success. Waitley goes on to tell us that his grandmother advised him to follow the lessons of the Bible and model his life on people who have creatively serviced others.Love is the most valuable gift that can be given he writes, and quickly adds, that it cannot be given by someone who doesn't possess it. Love is an emotion. When we feel it inside, we have something to give. Giving love away is done by successful people regardless of the crowd he notes because, ""their own self-worth is stronger than the rejection or acceptance of their ideas by others.""That's a small sampling of the delicious intellectual meal awaiting you in this extremely motivational book. It will fill your mind with the kind of input that will work itself out in desired accomplishments."
5,Inspiring Must Read!,The kind of book I'd want all my children to read. Insight and wisdom lacking in many of today's professionals. It will fill you with energy and clarity of direction.
4,An Inspirational Classic!,"This is my first Denis Waitley book. Waitley has done well to illustrate these basic truths about the power thought, will, persistence, faith and other seeds of greatness with touching personal stories and anecdotes. His doting grandmother and her down-to-earth wisdom are truly inspiring for me.My advice is to read each chapter and to practice his recommended skills section before moving on to the next chapter. You'll be able to appreciate these pearls of wisdom better and you'll also start to see the positive changes in yourself!Not just another motivational book on the shelf. This is in the league of Og Mandino, Norman Vincent Peale and James Allen.Wait no longer. Plant your seeds of greatness today!God Bless."
3,Ethan Frome,"I thought Ethan Frome was an average book. At times though, I had to push myself to read it because I'm not really into romance novels. Edith Wharton (the Author) gives the book a lot of details at times and I think thats why I found the book to be only average. Although, I like the way that Edith Wharton brought Jotham into the story. He doesn't play a major role like Ethan, Zeena, or Mattie, but his character helped bring their house to life. The book was about a young lady who took care of Ethans mother in her last hours (Zeena) and Ethan and her begin to fall in love. The interesting twist to the story is that when Zeena begins to also have a life threatening disease, her cousin Mattie comes to live with them to help out around the house. Ethan and Mattie start to fall in love and the rest of the story takes off from there. I don't want to give away the ending because that is about the only part in the book that I actually liked and enjoyed reading."
5,Great Kit for FM DX reception,I purchased one of these units for my own use. I love building kits and this one was a real source of joy. I plan to use it to boost a real low signal that I want to listen to daily. Very well designed.
3,"It's Cool, But Could've Been A Lot Better","I'm a huge Quik fan and this DVD is cool, but it had too much studio footage and too much of the camera following Quik around. And the big dissappointment was that it only had 4 videos. It should've had most if not all of his videos and a better biography of how he got started in the game. So you should only buy this if your a big Quik fan. If not than don't bother."
5,This DVD is awesome,"This DVD is so good. I picked it up at my local store for $10 Australian Dollars. This has the full-length film-clips for ""Tonite"", ""Trouble"", ""Born & Raised In Compton"" & ""Quik Is The Name"". It also has lots of concert footage, a tupac tribute, a mausberg tribute & lots of behind-the-scenes footage. If i was u i would get this without even thinking twice about it."
2,Flimsy,"We purchased these, along with the saw set for our son, and they looked so cute. When they arrived, they are thin plastic and hollow. I do not think they would have lasted working on his tool bench. For the price I thought they would have been less flimsy."
4,Good Prep,If your child is homeschooled like ours this test prep is important. We quickly discovered our child's deficiencies using this product. The testing format of multiple choice will familiarize them with state required tests.
5,THE NEW ERA,Hey people first of all this is the greatest series of all time and second I have followed this series from the beginningever since RALLY CRY came out all those years ago . At first I bought it cuz of the Cover but a year later I read it and became immersed . After the #8 book there will be 3 more books entitled DOWN THE SEA and it will chronicle events after the BANTAG WAR . If you have any more questions e mail me at my address .
4,Series that SHINES,"I can't say which of the books in this series is my favorite. I love them all. Alternate Universe and Civil War buff readers will enjoy. If you're not into Civil War books, this set will most likely have you read more. W.R. Forstchen at his best."
4,Here is the site,"A lot of people have asked me about bood number 8. It is scheduled to come at the end of this year, more towards December.There is a web site I happened upon... this site is great to give all the forthcoming books for all sci-fi series."
4,This is a great series,"When book one of this series was loaned to me I put off reading it because it just didn't look like my cup of tea. Needless to say, I was wrong. I haven't been this enthused about a series since Phillip Jose Farmer's ""Riverworld"" . This particular book, while not the best one, was very fast paced and enjoyable.This was the one I waited longest for and I can't wait for the next one.......I would love to see a grand finlale, but don't really want it to end......Please, William, get to work on #8 ASAP.....and I have to agree with everyone else...a map couldn't hurt!"
4,"Good, but not as good as the early books in the series","This is my favorite, currently running series. However, I have to say that the later books are not as good as the earlier ones. Some of the more interesting characters are getting killed off, and some of those that remain seem to have different personalities than they did before. Even some of the names are getting mushed from one book to the next. Still, it is a great book and a great series. I would advise someone to start with the first one before this one though. You will probably get hooked on them just as I did, and will be looking forward to number eight as eagerly as I am."
3,This is a product catalog,I must have mis-understood what this book was. It turned out to be a concept book for a product line of manufactered ironwork. Not what I was hoping for. The product was new and the shipping was fast. Any problems I have with it have nothing to do with the seller.
4,Gorgeous--Where is the CD!,"There is a conspiracy to suppress the best music by not issuing it on CD, forcing everyone to buy into the miserable, compressed, badly distorted and overloading MP3 format suited for screechy earbuds jammed in tin ears. Here is an example. I found a near mint LP by searching elsewhere, so bleep the headachy bozo format. Material is excellent, however."
2,skateboard Roadmap,This book only tells you some tricks and they dont show you pictures of it. So I think it was a wast of mony
3,Perhaps a great find?,Found this today at the annual library sale for $1 and now that I have read the reviews on Amazon I am anxious to read it.
1,T. V. Goodwin is right,"Too late.I just read T. V. Goodwin review after I placed an order for MAGIX Audio Clean Lab 10. I am going to send a complaint to the FTC since it says nothing about the upgrade on the package until one go to export a file as a MP3 format. The upgrade says nothing about not being transferable. It is bad enough to have to buy a program twice, but 3 and 4 times? That is why I quit buying Norton products."
1,You'll need insecticide and a lot of patience,"I have never owned a piece of software as buggy as this thing. I am running it on an AMD 64 3500+ system with RAID and SATA drives, XP Pro. This thing does nothing but crash. I got it to record a record, but when I went to the audio cleaning section, it crashed every time I tried to use the Wizard. The interface is not very intuitive and the whole thing is cobbled up with really stupid looking audio equipment faceplates and dials. What a mess. I have yet to make a recording with it. Don't waste your money on this software. Want to buy my copy? I certainly can't use it."
5,Very special book,"This is the second volume which covers the much publicized controversy between George Whitefield and John Wesley. Two men who shaped the Methodist Movement and were mightily used by God to turn the world upside down. The work that George Whitefield did to open up the gospel to people that had not heard is to this day not equaled. This was the ""prince of preachers of the 18th century."" The only other to earn that esteemed title would come some hundred years later, C.H. Spurgeon. If you can find the first volume, it is worth it to see what early influences were brought to bear upon this giant of the faith"
5,This is the standard for history / biography,"The best history / biography I have ever read. George Whitefield's life is exceedingly interesting and Dallimore covers it and all the history of others surrounding it, exhaustively!"
5,excellent book,I am a Catholic and I found this book to be both inspiring and refreshing. Cahill gives a history of the papacy to provide background for the reign of John XIII and tells the story of John's life up until his death. This is an excellent book for understanding the history of the church and the second vatican council. Very refreshing and spiritually enlightening.
1,Good guys and Bad guys,"Liberals: good. Conservatives:bad. John XXIII: a saint.Sadly, that's pretty much a synopsis of this book."
3,This biography is no biography,"Let me say at the outset I enjoyed this book. I am also not Catholic. But this book is not about John XXIII. It's about Thomas Cahill writing a 200-page history of the Catholic Church and saying why he doesn't like Pope John Paul II. It's a similar trick used by John Cornwall in his book Hitler's Pope. Thomas Cahill is a wonderful writer, and he condenses and popularizes history better than anyone going. But let's be honest; this can be summed up in the comment Cahill relates from a Jesuit that the Catholic Church has been set back some 200 years by John Paul's pontificate. That admission comes in the final chapter, and it speaks volumes about how the life of a godly man has been used, painted in broad and vague brushstrokes, simply to promulgate someone's ""enlightened view"" of how others should worship."
2,Ax to grind?,"This book does not come close to Cahill's other books (How the Irish saved civilization, Gift of the Jews, Desire of the Everlasting Hills). Cahill presents a leftist's view of the Catholic Church. Anything ""progressive"" is good, the traditional church is bad. John Paul II sets the church back. Seems that Cahill goes for the permissive church, the welfare state. I was deeply disappointed."
5,Wonderful account of the life of John XXIII,"My husband and I read this book together...we enjoyed every moment of this book, some times crying, some times a bit of laughter, most of the time we felt we were blessed by Thomas Cahill's talent of putting pen to paper and walking us through a great read."
5,Different perspective,"I have read numerous books by Thomas Cahill, and I have found him to be sound in the intentions of illustrating to the reader not just the factual information, but too, the historical perspective. He does not hesitate to let the reader know what side of the fence he is on.I like Cahill, and his leading the reader through the historical background showing us the huge act of courage Pope John XX 111 demonstrated. With the knowledge of the historical, Cahill transitions the reader into what not only took place in 1962, but also give us a greater perspective on today's Vatican attempt to dismantle all he had accomplished."
2,Poor Knock -off,"First, it was pictured as a handle and 2 boxes of cartridges. What came was a handle with 2 cartridges. After using it, I would not recommend it. It gives a rough shave(hard on the skin) and the blades have a tendency to pop out of the handle. Back to Gillette for me."
1,Too Superficial a Study,"While American Reformers gives a fair overview of significant individuals and their movements in U.S. history, the book glosses over much material. Walters has accumulated much data, but it comes across as if he's heading a p.r. campaign for reformers instead of digging deep into his area. Much of Walter's writing is very light here and elsewhere (especially in his monthly columns he writes under the name of ""Guido Veloce"" for the Johns Hopkins Magazine) and at times it appears frivilous."
4,"Simple design, easy to keep clean.","The Audubon oriole feeder is easy to clean, unlike most hummingbird feeders. Unfortunately, my hooded oriole visitor hasn't been by to try it. Finches will visit the orange slice on top, though. Is there a finch guard?For those who are trying to fight garden pests with green lacewings, I noticed that adult green lacewings are attracted to the orange color and enter through the feeding holes to lay eggs on the underside of the cover. After which they fall into the sugar water (I was able to rescue those that had). So for now my oriole feeder is an orange finch-feeder green-lacewing incubator--I need to take off the bottom, so the larva can escape when the eggs hatch."
2,Audobon Oriole Feeder,"I was disappointed with the small dishes to put the jelly in compared to the other feeder that I had. My old feeder's perches broke and when I tried to find it again to buy, it was not available. My orioles and catbirds like the jelly a lot more than the nectar..."
5,nice feeder,"nice feeder, easy to clean, has ant moat and places for jelly as well. only down side is wasps and bees can fit through the ports and drown."
4,oriole feeder needs birds,"I like the design of my oriole feeder, and it is easy to clean. But so far it has only attracted wasps, bees, and ants. Orioles have flown by, one even landed, but no regular visitors."
2,not what I expected,"My Oriole feeder from the last 3 seasons finally broke, so I got this one to replace it. This feeder is small and light weight (not a bad thing in itself) but you can't see how much nectar is left in the feeder so you don't know when to refill it. My Orioles really like nectar. I know a lot of people say they like grape jelly and oranges more than nectar but my Orioles don't - they LOVE the nectar. Right now all I have hanging up out there are 2 cheap (Wally World) Hummer feeders and they're attracting all the Orioles I can handle! I think I'll stick with them - the Orioles don't discourage the Hummers (they're not afraid of those big guys!) so I get the best of both worlds on one feeder. I wouldn't purchase this feeder."
2,Too Many Honeybees were dying,I liked the style and ease of this feeder but too many honeybees were dying. I came home one day and there were bees stuck inside some still slowly drowning. I took them out and saved as many as I could. The next day there were probably 100 dead honeybees inside this feeder. I don't know if it is a poor design but I don't want to be killing any more honeybees. I haven't used it since. I think it was probably a waste of money.
4,A good try.,"We put this feeder out early in the spring in southern NH hoping the color would attract Golden Orioles before the trees came into leaf. We did not see any Orioles on the feeder but maybe it did help because we did see them on our Humming bird feeders!We did see Cow birds on the feeder, they liked the grape jelly but the fruit was never touched"
2,one good thing,"I chose this feeder because of the Audubon seal. The quality and price were fine, but the orioles only ate the grape jelly. They never touched the sugar mixture or the orange. I wish I had just purchased a jelly feeder."
4,A fun book!,"I liked this book a lot. I didn't laugh out loud all the way through, but a few cartoons really hit home. Especially the New Fad cartoons. That's so true, people think of us as jumping on a bandwagon, when this diet goes back to Pythagoras or even farther."
1,The Joy-LESS of Soy,"I got this book as a gift and I thank God becasue, if I had actually paid money for it, I think I would have sued the publisher.This book is unfunny and the cartoon artwork looks like it was drawn by a 5-year-old.Save your money and buy a vegi-burger."
5,Our everyday go-to,"In our house, we have several vegetarian cookbooks. This one, by far, contains the most approachable, straight-forward recipes that are delicious and nutritious. I highly recommend this book to anyone."
2,5 stars?? Really?,"I bought this book, hoping to convert my husband to a more vegetarian diet. Usually, I try recipes selectively from cookbooks that contain a range of meat and vegetarian options. Good cookbooks will have good recipes, regardless of the orientation. I have tried probably 8 or 10 recipes from this book, and every single one has disappointed. The Julia Child award assured me that this would be something special, as did all the glowing reviews here. I don't get it! Given all the sophistication in the food world--even the home cooking world--today, I can think of no excuse for such bland, lifeless, unimaginative recipes. I give this 2 stars only because I still have hopes there is SOMETHING exciting in this cookbook; I'll keep trying."
3,Good but a little much for me,Im dabbling with vegetarianism and cooking (esp dinner) seems challenging-This has tons of recipes but most of them I wouldnt eat or seems like it would be an all day project to make. In the book's defense I am a picky eater-and not a very experienced cook so I was looking for something pretty easy and simple to prepare. Some of the ingredients I have never heard of (but she does tell you where you can find them) Its not a bad book-I had a friend recommend it for me actually-but I think maybe as I get more experienced I will come back to it.
5,Best all around,"This is one of my favorite cookbooks and I use it over and over. It's a cookbook that I go to for a wide variety of recipes. It has basics like broth, cakes, crackers, soups, and more complex things like tortilini, gnocchi, strudels. Really good index. Its a great ""reference"" cookbook. I think it's a must for any cookbook library. The peanut sauce is awesome, and so is the tortilla pie (polenta crust). Easy to understand recipes, easy to find ingredients."
5,I am NOT a vegetarian,"I am simply someone with high blood pressure who was looking for a source of ideas for eating healthier. This book is terrific for that purpose.Like rice and beans but not the 1200mg sodium in the packaged mixes ? Try Creole Red Beans and Rice, p.142. Can't face eating steamed broccoli one more time ? Try sauteed broccoli and garlic, p.242. I use (sodium-free) chicken broth rather than veg broth most of the time. There's a fine Caesar salad without anchovies. Time after time I ask the question - what can I do with avocado, asparagus, broccoli,... and the book always has a good answer."
5,A fabulous cookbook!,"I found this cookbook about two years ago, shortly after I became a vegetarian. I have quite a few vegetarian cookbooks now, but this one is still my all-time favorite. Great variety of recipes, most of them quick and easy, though she also has many more elaborate dishes too. I can't say enough good things about this cookbook!"
2,Bland and Boring....,"I was really excited about this book, especially after reading such great reviews. I have made a number of recipes, and most of them have been so bland- we've had to add a lot of spices just to make them have any flavor. Some have been good- but I am disappointed."
5,Excellent,Recieved item before expected...It is just what I wanted. I hope to do business again.Thanks
2,"Should be called ""1001 Cheese Recipes""","Despite honors from Julia Childs and James Beard this book is lacking imagination and any commitment to vegetarian cooking. Everything tastes better with cheese (eggs and butter). Try making something delicious without it! Her comments on tofu and tempeh revealed that this author has little or no exposure to soy products and their preparation. Her vegan recipes were frighteningly colorless reenforcing the notion that vegetarian cooking is bland, flavorless and strange. Why not put a little cornmeal on that tempeh before frying it, Carroll? Her adaptations of standard college veggie cuisine like hummus and baba ganouji were flat and lacked any real effort to make them her own. All in all this author wracked her brain to come up with 1001 recipes and it shows!"
3,First Tail Light was chipped,Gave it three stars because the first tail light came in chipped on the left corner. Had to drop it off and get it replaced. The process was fast and Amazon made it easy ... BUT I wish they didn't mail out a flawed tail light in the first place. The replacement came in quick. They say it might take a month and will email you when they'll have it available but both tail lights was shipped and arrive in about 7-8 days. I thought it would take longer than that. All in all: First tail light was flawed; fast delivery time and easy to replacement; Tail light fits my 2003 Civic LX coupe.
5,Early Church Fathers,"If you are Christian (especially Catholic) and are forever challenged by Fundamentalists, this book is one of many great resources. Reformers, in particular, try to discredit these documents but that is not new. The translation was tough for me and I did not find it an easy read. However, it held my interest and it turned out to be a quick read, considering the subject matter. I consider myself an amateur apologist of sorts for The Church and this resource is valuable when dealing with the ignorant (we will always have them with us, just like the poor)."
4,Church History,These manuscripts put a little different light on accepted canon. What the founders of the faith faced and managed to thrive in spite of severe oppression is something of which every Christian should be made aware.
2,Cedar Dream Songs,"I fell in love with Bill Miller with such albums as The Art of Survival and Reservation Road. The songs in these albums were unique and were colored with Bill Miller's Indian heritage. One of them has a really wonderful Indian flute instrumental, Wind Spirit. Each time, I looked forwarded to new releases from Bill. Then, one day it seemed that he felt guilty that he was denying his 'traditional' Indian heritage. From then on his albums, like this one, sounded like every other Native Indian recording. Sigh!!! The later albums are so ho hum. Bill, please go back to songs like Reservation Road, Ordinary Man and Tumbleweed. These songs and others on the other two albums I mentioned above, were drawn from your Native Indian heritage and are so far above anything you are producing these days."
2,"toxic substance in ""non-toxic"" recipes","As another reviewer has mentioned, almost every one of the recipes in this book uses sodium lauryl sulfate. This substance is a well-known allergen and one that no member of my family can tolerate. We must diligently read labels on everything from shampoo and toothpaste to headache remedies to avoid contact with this ubiquitous irritant. I was surprised and disappointed to see it listed as an ingredient on page after page.I found this book at the library, and I was very glad that I had not purchased it myself.A waste of money as far as the recipes go, although the illustrating photos are nice and the author's comments about attempting telepathy as a means of insect repellent are amusing."
4,Slip 'n' slide,This is a fun dildo...my only complaint is the rubbery fruity smell it has...it's noticeable but not quite overpowering...i love how long this is. I just wish it had a little more girth. I love how it feels while using it and it's even better when you add a vibrator for clitoral excitement simultaneously...thanks for another fun experience!
1,Terrible stench!,So I have had this for over a year now... and it still stinks! Not to mention that the type of rubber is very sticky.... and will pick up any bit of lint.Save your money and try something else...
2,Not very happy with this..,"I had decided to buy my toys off of amazon because of the huge price difference everywhere else is so expensive...But I guess price does matter I bought several different toys off of here and im not really happy with any of them,The size of this is very short the girth is good but the length is way shorter than what I thought it was going to be I dont know if me and my partner will even be able to use this together..And It also like the others had a very strong chemical smell to it but I hope it will go away with some washing!!"
4,Very well made and tight,These are really good. I own 3 pair. My only problem is I ruined my 1st pair after daily use for 5 months. I wore it everyday because it was the only one I had. It's also not the softest pair but it breathes well. The main wear and tear are in the heel..
2,Not a good feel.,The bristles are too thick and too far apart. I felt like my hair was still knotted and not smooth.
3,Fell apart quickly,"Loved the way this brush actually brushed my hair, however the pad with the bristles on it disconnected from the brush within a month of receiving it."
4,Not another dull poetry book,"Anne's Anthology is a compilation of many of the pieces of poetry which Lucy Montgomery mentioned in Anne of Green Gables. They were the pieces which ""Anne"" loved. These were pieces that the girls in Lucy Montgomery's audience were very familiar. Many of these pieces have been lost from recognition and therefore the allusions are no longer understood. Like a patchwork quilt made from scraps of loved clothing, Anne's Anthology exposes its readers to best-loved poems from a previous era. Anne's Anthology contains footnotes and illustrations to help the modern reader understand these poems."
2,Listening to the written word,"I find the reader of this audiotext ""Witness to Appomatox"" very difficult to understand. Besides trying to understand his quick English/Irish accent, the ending to his sentences sounded a bit weak which made it even more difficult to listen to. Read the book instead."
4,"D'aaaw, cute little Bambi","I liked this book alot, in fact it's one of my favorites. ... It is alot different then the movie, but some parts are quite the same, thought the book is much better. the only thing i didnt like about it was the simplicity. ... This book seems like for kids, but is kinda brutil. shows how nature REALLY is. ..."
1,A Reckless Adaptation of A Tired Fable,Mindless enthusiasm for simplistic woodland tales is most often found in those puzzled by whitetail deer populations in suburban areas that now can exceed 100 animals per acre. There is no Disney-like nobility in deer displaced by urban sprawl. And the illustration of a dead hunter in the snow is simply gratutitious violence.
4,"Bambi, Life in the Woods is Wonderful","The story is a little sad, but it is very interesting. There are a lot of animals in it, and anyone who likes animals would enjoy reading this book. It takes place in a forest and a meadow. The author uses lots of exotic names of animals such as sedgehens and yellow birds. The main enemy is man and He comes into the story a bit too much. The story is very detailed and does have lots of hard words, but it's worth reading. I liked it much better than the Disney movie."
1,Why buy this when you can have the original?,I don't understand. Why buy this version by Janet Schulman when you can have the original written by Felix Salten himself? Is Salten's version out of copyright? Is someone else trying to make money off of it?
4,An impressive nature story,"Salten's tale of animal lives and survival in the woods can touch many people.The tale of Bambi's maturity from fawn to stag parallels many other stories of growing up and realization.Bambi is one of Felix Salten's first and best animal stories, showing how similar humans and animals really are."
3,worth a quick skim,"Not a bad piece of writing by someone who was truly ""there"" and isn't ashamed to make some bucks off of it now that she isn't. You'll probably enjoy the book whether you're pro- or anti-Bush, since Hughes avoids any serious discussion of the issues. It's worth skimming quickly, if only to get some semi-interesting tidbit to drop in a conversation at work or a party. By the way, what's up with the picture of Bush on the cover? I'm not sure why, but he looks a little weird to me. And when did he ever grow his hair that long?"
1,Another Version of What MIGHT BE the Truth,"I started to read this book with great anticipation; I had hoped to read about the nuances and details of life in the White House. After about thirty or so pages, I quit; because, I realized I had been had. If she spent all of her time at home in Texas writing this book, she needs a new consultant; she wasted a lot of time putting these words on a page.Ms. Hughes wrote the book to make $$$ from many unsuspecting folk; there is nothing ""new"" here. Feeling like I should have read more of the book for I had paid my money for this thing I returned to read randomly throughout the book. NOTHING HAS CHANGED FOR ME - I do believe that Ms. Hughes should go on national television and apologize for having written such a work; its best use would be to line the bird cage."
5,"Personal journal of a political leader, suporter of President Bush - Karen Hughes","I really enjoyed this book. It gives a good insight into a busy life of a politician..BEAWERE, Karen Hughes is a friend and a supporter of President Bush, so if you lack respect for the president you won't rate this book very high!"
1,Don't put money in this woman's pocket,"In her criticism of the pro-choice rally taking place in Washington on April 25, she is equating support for pro-choice policies and politicians as support for al-Qaeda. She is a shameless policial hack -- decency prevents me from stating what I really think of her. Don't buy her book. Don't support her destructive, divisive politics disguised as ""compassionate conservatism."""
1,It is junk,"Despite what some have said on this review thread, this book really is a piece of junk. It is poorly written, and is so sappy in it's admiration for George Bush that you can use as a topping for your waffles.I would recommend other books if you're interested in the Bush adminstration because this one has no depth or substance, and reads like childrens book."
2,family values,"While being no fan of Hughes, I was concerned when she left the White House. When an administration official says they're leaving to 'spend more time with their families.' is usually code for, 'I'm leaving because of unreconcilable differences'Now we find out that she left the White House to write a book about 'spending time with her family', (which in reality is just cheerleading pap for the bush administration)And she accuses Richard Clarke of political aggrandizement and profiteering?"
2,What would Dr. Laura say?,"Surely Dr. Laura must be having a fit, what with Ms. Hughes abandoning her teenagers, causing them to become latchkey kids, just so she can selfishly re-enter the rat race. It's not all about YOU, Ms. Hughes, your role is as a mother to your children. Further, when you stepped down as advisor to the president a year ago to return to your family, it's clear now that you spent all that time writing a book! A book! And now, a year later, the book finished, you're returning to the White House!As Dr. Laura says, children (especially teenagers) are in need of parental guidance, and a stay-at-home mom whose focus is on THEM, not professional aspirations."
4,"Masterful communicator, Masterful manipulator","Karen Hughes is a brilliant communicator and master of the anecdote and the parable. For those who have heard Karen Hughes before, this book will not have much of anything new. But I walk away from this book with the same sense I had walking away from her last speech. Be afraid. Be very afraid. This woman is brilliant, a master manipulator, and a fanatic. Her stories truly are masterful, often appearing as though they address an issue, and for the vast majority of Americans who do not stop to think and consider the logic, the manipulation and irrelevance of her story to her point is lost. As a woman, a parent, and a person who cares about having a habitable world, I can only thank God that Bush Jr. is not as smart as Karen Hughes."
3,Haven't read it,"but was not surprised by customer reviews including such comments as, ""Anyone who criticizes this book clearly hasn't read it and just plain hate Republicans and/or George Bush."" I have not read the book and it is logical that I should not criticize it. I *have*, however, read some of the customer reviews and ""defensive"" would be the word I would use. This repeated theme among Bush supporters of ""if you criticize him it is because you hate him, nothing else"" is getting to be disturbing. Surely even Bush supporters do not think he is beyond criticism? If not, I suggest you spend some time studying history and you may find that the leaders associated with this kind of mindless support are *not* the ones you'd most like to emulate.By the way, I gave three stars because it wouldn't let me post without doing it - figure an average score shouldn't mess up the consensus of ratings for the book."
3,"This appears to be a discussion board, not a review board","so I'll chime in again. Again, haven't read the book, don't intend to waste the time, have read the customer reviews. Comments such as ""If you are just some hate-filled liberal, please don't bother posting your hate here,"" are *dead on*, with one caveat (if you are pro-Bush you will likely ignore said caveat): that goes for mindless, cheerleading conservative praise from those who *also* haven't read the book, and never will. Let's have reviews that are fair and balanced (no, no - not the Fox news version - the *real* thing).Again 3 stars so as not to disrupt whatever consensus is building."
1,Know Thine Enemy!,"Bush's Dominatrix Hughes is a consumate liar and expert at intellectual abuse and manipulation. The ONLY reason anyone should read this book is to ""know thine enemies""!The very idea that my tax dollars pay her salary let alone some moron publisher thought he/she could cash in on the ignorance of the average American is infuriating beyond belief. They KILLED TREES for this bimbo?This dumbed down treatise on her nauseating reveling in her personal arrogance and hubris is a perfect example of why this nation has become so detested around the world."
1,"This is so, like, shallow","What a waste of paper. Do not waste your time on this book, unless you want to learn deep facts like what kind of cheese Ms. hughes recommended that George bush put on his cheeseburger on 9/12/2001. good lord, is this what our country has come to? As a life-long Republican, I am appalled."
1,Hypocrisy,"A poorly written paean to our Worst President Ever. A cheap suck-up piece.The one thing I learned from this book is that the woman responsible for the ""John Kerry looks kinda French"" smears that circulated early in the campaign was herself born in Paris.She looks kinda...Soviet...to me."
2,Karen Loves Herself,"I read a review that said whether or not you are a Bush person would decide if you like this book or not. Well, I am a huge supporter of the president and I have to say, this book falls short. I found it hard to swallow how highly this woman thinks of herself. I do think she was a good communications advisor to the president and I guess that is why I was expecting more. For the money, you are much better off with David Frum's The Right Man. If you can pick this up at the library, it might be worth your time, but if you are spending money, I recommend looking in another direction."
1,Mission Accomplished: Send The Other Kids To War,"Hey Karen and George, you volunteering your sons and daughters for duty in Fallujah? Wow, I mean Karen Hughes is such a patriot -- she thinks everyone should fight for her cause except her own family. But what else do you expect from someone's who supposed to be more loyal than the family dog?After reading the book, my question would be how could such a smart woman worship such an ignorant, sheltered, phony that stumbled into being President. Is this the best our country can do, a pampered son of a former President who had a track record of failure in every other past venture? Or how about a corporate crook who sold his shares ahead of a bad earnings report and then failed to file with the SEC? Or how about a drunken driver who very easily could have killed your loved one?In any case, you'll get some clear insight into the mind of a Stepford wife, a blind devotee and true believer in the equivalent of a village idiot."
1,"PR, PR, PR (stands for pointless rhetoric)","If this book had ONE thing of substance in it, I'd be happy to report. Having known Hughes in a former life, I can testify that she is a master of spin (I think she even believes it herself sometimes). She can write in circles for pages and pages, and this she has done well. But this book has NOTHING of substance in it except perhaps to let the public know that Karen really REALLY likes geo bush and owes him a lot. If this book is her payback, he should be concerned."
1,What a Crock!,"You know, I voted for Bush in 2000. I supported Iraq. I read this book. It's looking more and more like I made three mistakes, three more than Hughes says Bush has made. This book is nothing more than Hughes showing that she is Bush's cheerleader.If this is how deep this administration is, they've lost my vote. Unfortunately, I can't get back the time I spent reading this claptrap of a book."
1,What a loser!!!!!,Anyone who can compare the ability of women to choose what to do with their lives to 911 and the war on terror is a terrorist herself. Don't buy this book and support this kind of mind set. What the bushies want to take complete control of your lives and to create rules of what we can and can't do. I though the wall came down years ago. Apparently they shipped it to the US and are building here. Stand up for what you believe and the right to make our own choices. Boycott her book and book tour!!!!!!!!!!
1,Propoganda and junk,"Let's see, according to Hughes:1. Pro-choice folks are terrorists2. Only republicans are normal3. George Bush is our best president ever4. This administration is flawlessHere we have yet another attempt to dumb down our country. These are the same folks who left a mess in Texas."
1,Troubling,"What a waste of time. If you want to read about President Bush ordering cheeseburgers, KH using bacon on her skin, and other inane topics, then this book might be good. But it is shameless in its star struck representations of GWB. She makes him out to be superman, cary grant, and god all in one.Save your money."
4,Can't We Just Try to Get Along?,"I think somewhere back in the misty recesses of history there have been a few times when Republicans and Democrats somehow laid aside their nasty animosities and worked together for some valuable compromises. I think on some very rare occasions, Reps and Dems have worked together because they knew they had to. I even think there have been a few cases in which there was deep, abiding respect between particular members of opposing parties. I'm tempted to think maybe that sentiment has died for good when I read many of these reviews. Could they be more rude and mean-spirited? Maybe, but not a whole lot. Kids, Bush was wrong on some issues and right on others, just like the rest of us human creatures...just like every Democrat who has ever served. Ease up a little."
5,FANTASTIC!,"Mrs. Hughes has written a master piece that will fill your heart with joy and remind you that everyone in Washington, whether Republicans or Democrats, are human. She is charming, funny, witty, straight foreward, and honest. Her book is an inspiration for any person, a women who has worked in the ''halls of power'' and whos story will make you love her. Shes very honest and has written a political book that is one of a kind, in that it bashes NO ONE. For someone as myself who reads a lot of these political books it is a wonderful change. Whether you support President Bush or not, this is a book that everyone should read in order to paint a clearer picture instead of the one that has fogged America's view with Democrat's bashing and name calling. The book was a real treat and I never wanted it to end. Great job Karen."
1,Don't fall for this Bush campaign garbage,"This book is nothing more than window dressing for the worst and most dangerous President in the history of this country -- to revive the phony ""compassionate conservative"" theme just in time for the 2004 campaign. Incidentally, sales of this book will also put lots of money into the pockets of the author, even though she and her cronies in the Administration are always ready to claim that any author critical of George Bush is motivated only by profit. Save your money -- or better still, contribute it to organizations that support veterans and their families, who are getting the shaft from this government."
4,Very telling Book,"I though Karen's book was most excellent. But I was a little confused about the title. With her ""unique point of view"" I thought a more proper title would be ""The View from Bush's colon looks wonderful"""
5,When Is A Review Not A Review,"When it is a blog. Apparently only the left, when they find themselves in a deep hole, keep digging. As one reviewer noted earlier this is supposed to be a place for book reviews, not a place for leftist whackos to vent their spleen and spew their vitriol. So blinded by hate and choking on their own ideology they now find themselves falling further behind the power curve and so now attack the messenger. WHY?? Because their messages have been repudiated by an ever more aware electorate that refuses to be spoonfed their elitist BS. You know who you are!! You reap what you sow!! Live With It!!"
1,wow,"This is a fawning, fan-letter kind of book that used to be published by Bananas Magazine in the 1970's. Only those books used to be about teen stars like Scott Baio and Willie Ames...and they were a lot more subtle and insightful.Karen Hughes thinks God chose Bush to win the 2000 election and ""come to a royal position for such a time as this.""Karen Hughes thinks George Bush is so intelligent that his tongue can't keep up with his brain, thus all his speaking gaffes and inability to give a speech without looking down at his notes every third word.Karen thinks the Harvard/Yale educated, Maine raised son and grandson of prominent Washington DC insiders has a ""disdain for East Coast elitism"".Karen must think we are as dumb as poor George's tongue."
2,Your Enjoyment Will Depend on Your Views of Bush,"I will dispense with my typical, reasoned review style for this book. Whether you should buy and read this book is actually a fairly simple question. Ask yourself this:o) Do you approve of Bush? If so, you will greatly enjoy this loving, insider look at him and his campaigns.o) Do you hate Bush? If so, this book will enrage you, and it's soft-focus view of the President will drive you wild.o) Are you undecided about Bush? If so, decide if the insider look will be enjoyable to you, or if the fact that that this book is too admiring of Bush will drive you wild.Hughes makes no secret of the fact that Bush is Her Guy; whether he is Your Guy will ultimately determine if this is the book for you."
1,187 used & new from $0.02,"No one should let this book escape perusal, especially at this reasonable price! You've heard that Karl Rove is ""Bush's brain?"" Well, Ms. Hughes is ""Bush's brain on drugs (with a side of bacon)!""To read her describe Dubya's mind as ""laser-like"" leaves no doubt in my own mind that when she worked for Reagan, she was a conduit for Dubya on the ""Star Wars - Strategic Defense Initiative"" project. I don't remember if that was his pre-cocaine or post-cocaine years, but it all makes so much sense now.I'm happy that after a lifetime of one political success after another, she took time off from her busy schedule for a sabbatical to bake brownies for her young, hungry son. I wonder if perchance, she has a recipe for a cake with a file in it?Now that she's back on the team with her traveling road-show thumping America's generosity and love for the rest of the world, I suppose her son will go hungry, but at least America will be safe from those naughty terrorists! Praise da lard!"
1,KoolAide Queen,"Every president needs his lackys, yes people, and media spinmeisters. Hughes is nothing more than one of these. If you want to read more lies like ""Bush has never to my knowledge made a decision as a result of political pressure"" which she said to Terri Gross on Fresh Air the day before he reversed his decision to forbid Rice's public testimony before the 911 Commission, then this book is for you. Most of the rest of the world will give it the ""Washington read"": look in the index to see if your name is mentioned, and read what she says about you."
3,One chromosome from normal...,"As a fan of transgender non-fiction I was somewhat disappointed by Karen Hughes (formerly known as Hugh Karinsky of Passaic NJ) story regarding his plight as a trangendered ""woman"" in America. This is not at all what I was expecting. I was impressed with ""Ms"" Hughes ongoing love affair with the commander-in-chief with all of it's ""love that dare not speak its name"" overtones, but the whole ""leaving my job for my (as it turns out) mythical family"" failed to contain the ring of truth I have come to expect from good Christians like ""Karen"".As a former teacher/librarian with a Xanax habit and two drunken twins, I need all the uplift I can get. I guess I'll have to look for good transgender/Christianity true-life stories elsewhere.Hmmm. Maybe the ""Left Behind"" books..."
1,Political Spin?,"Karen Hughes book is similar to the writings of any anti-feminist; anti-woman. She gladly takes her backstand to all males- as conservative women do. Her description of GW Bush as having a ""laser-like mind"" is laughable and only confirms my suspicion regarding her lack of average intelligence.Anyone who can look at George W. Bush and not see a moron-is a moron herself.Hughes insults not only herself but all women who enjoy an above-average level of intelligence. Dont bother reading it unless you too, have such low self-esteem that you wish to degrade yourself and all women."
1,Bush knew Sept. 11 was going to happen!,"Karen Hughes delivers a walloping new book that places her in the fine company of Leni Riefenstahl. George Bush loves America, but hates Americans. Karen supplants Karl Rove as the real propaganda mastermind in the Bush Administration. After orchestrating the smear campaign against Richard Clarke, she's equating pro-choice supporters with terrorists.Well Karen, as a New Yorker who lived through 9/11 I have just one question. Karen, why does George love the Saudis so much?"
4,Works as Advertised - Almost,"Product installed easily with minimal manual time. I particularily like the feature controlling access to the internet and general computer access seperately. This allows the kids to prepare a report without spending their ""valuable"" internet time.Only complaint is we have not yet received any reports from WebRoot regarding sites visited. After registering the product we received an acknowledgement of the registration but no reports."
1,yuck,"My estimation of humanity went down a notch when I read the reviews of this book.The book is clumsily written, and uses cheap sentimental tricks to try to get us to swallow the shallow and ultimately dumb chunks of sophmoric philosophy.That people can be charmed or even moved by this kind of bunk makes me sad, and also makes me realize how vulnerable people are, and how many would rather go for comforting and easy answers than actually think and confront the realities of the world.And no, I do not believe there was any such child."
3,Book,The book seems comes from a library. It is not as good as described in the ad. I am wondering how a library book will be on sale.
4,Holding Hands with Mister God,"I really enjoyed reading this novel of a little girl's understanding of Mister God, partially because of how it delved into personal spiritual development and fellowship, and largely because it tried to approach quandaries about faith with a scalpel and wizened simplicity. Sometimes it succeeded; other times it failed. Regardless of the misses, the entire book is a wonderful eye-opener that will inspire you to take your own inventories, conduct your own experiments, and perhaps check your insides and outsides for Mister God daily.A friend recommended the book to me when I needed guidance on how to approach prayer; believe me, it helped tremendously."
5,"Mister God., This Is Anna","A friend shared his copy of this book with me many years ago and it became one of my favorites. It's a sweet book told by a little girl in her words. Funny and sad. Once you read this, you can't help but be touched..."
5,Mister Anna This is GOD,This book is the most amazing thing i have ever read. Anna figured out so many complex things at 5 that most people never understand.The best thing you could do with your time is to read this book.
5,AMAZING !,"This is THE most amazing book i have ever read. although it is categorized as a children's book, it is so sophisticated and witty that you have to be grown-up to fully understand it. Anna's conversations, discoveries and way of thinking is exceptional and intriguing.I truly recommend this book to all those who have a poetic streak in them."
3,mister god,"A life-changing, heart-opening, mind-expanding story. I highly recommend it. I was dissappointed with my order though - the books were in perfect condition but in an unusual size - very small making the book hard to read - and the paper is not of good quality. I don't feel i got great value for money with this purchase."
3,Hum,This book was interesting. It is kind of hard to believe that this actually happened though. I'm not a big fan of religious things though.
2,A Struggle,I hate to begin a book and walk away from it without finishing. I did read the entire book but found it real struggle to hang in there.
3,More suggestive than coherent,"Generally interesting, occasionally tedious, sappy, or scarcely credible. Worth reading, especially if you're interested in fundamental questions of theology, but more suggestive than coherent. Some good use of dialect. Anna herself is charming, and this is the best of Fynn's Anna books."
5,The book that changed me the most,"This book converted me from being a confirmed atheist to a shaky atheist and then to a shaky agnostic. After each reading of this book (more than five times in two years), I have changed some of my attitudes towards God, towards Godliness, towards nearly everything. It is a ""once in a lifetime"" kind of book. The sequels to this book are also as good. The drawings of Papas enhance the quality of the book. Even if they had not been there, this would have been a great book, but the drawings make it even greater (if it were possible)."
3,Nom de Plume! Not his real name!,"Daniel Easterman is the Nom de Plume of Denis McEoin, professor at Univ. Newcastle-upon-Tyne, an embittered ex-Baha'i."
5,Encyclopedia! Tractate on Autogenic Training. The best!,"This is THE classic manual on Autogenic Training and approach. There's nothing better that I've seen on the subject, nothing more detailed, and nothing more authoritative.If you're a medical professional or a serious hobbyist who wants to know as much about Autogenic method as there is to know - this is the manual. Make sure to study all the six volumes - they cover therapeutic applications."
4,"Great Story, Great Performances, Lousy Production","One of the most entertaining adaptations I know. The script is excellent, the performances perfect, the whole less-than-an-hour story is involving and funny and sad and subtle. After enjoying it for years and then watching it with my eight-year-old son whom I didn't expect to respond to such muted teenage romantic tensions, I was surprised that even he ""got it"" and laughed because the actors played their roles so effectively.But it's also one of the most poorly produced pieces, technically, that I know. Student-grade filming. I assume it's shot on 16mm film. The audio is muffled. It's a shame that such good acting and interacting was not served with better production."
3,Bernice Bobs Her Hair,"I think that this story was one of the better movies that we have watched in our english classes. It kept you wondering what was gonna happen and you wanted so see the end because the people are so different than today. The people that are friends with Marjorie are all stuck up and stick to their own social group and when Bernice comes they all look down on her. Marjorie thinks that Bernice is ruining her summer so she teaches her to ""fit in"" with her people. Bernice tries hard but when she bobs her hair then everyone frowns on her again. I think this story is a good one to watch in class because it is funny and shows you how you shouldn't give into peer pressure."
5,Hilariously comical,"Wow, what a movie. We watched this movie in english class. I laughed throughout the whole thing. The part of Bernice was played very well. I thought she fit the part. She was ditzy and ugly. I thought the part of marjorie was played well. She was pretty, self-centered, and very popular. She lured Bernice into a trap, but Bernice was not smart enough to realize it and she did not back out of bobbing her hair. In the end I thought it was funny how Marjorie's mom was all mad at Bernice.The end has a nice little twist.GREAT SHOW![.] HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!..."
3,Bernice,"I thought the movie was good for class use, but I don't think I'd go and rent it or buy it so I could watch in again. It helped show what kind of a writer Scott Fitzgerald is. It seems to me like he must have met someone in his life that was with a lot of guys and kind of snotty because I've now seen 2 works of his writing and both of them had a girl in there that was like that. I thought it was very rude of Marjorie to pull that on Bernice. Marjorie got Bernice to cut her hair after she had everyone liking her. Then after she got it cut no one liked her anymore so she had fallen into peer pressure. It was really rude of her to get her talked into it then the people who she thought were her friends abandoned her. But, overall I thought the movie was interesting and funny."
3,Never the less it's a movie....,"I think that this movie was ok but not the best one but for ususl english class movies, I gave this one props! I thought that Burnice was one scary looking girl, I can compleatly understand why her Cuz had to ask people to dance with her! Well, that doesnt excuse Margiry for the way she acts, but then look at her mother? I was thought this movie was kinda funny. I was rather suprised that it indicated sexual indications and peerpresure things that are still happening today. Just like Brunice everyone is now pushing to be different and go agenst the grain. Plus she was mean and spitful when she cut of Margeri's hair."
2,Hookah Lost,"Not a bad CD, but lacks the voice and writing capabilities of John Mullins. If you want to hear Hookah at their best, pick up the double live album or dubbabuddah. Also if you are ever in Columbus, Oh check out the Mullin's Band, he is sober and sounds better than ever...."
3,Personal review; your experience may vary,"I do like the Mojo bars, even with some of their unfriendly ingredients (see Lara bars for better alternative). However, this is the least favorite of my flavors. Honey roasted nut and the like hit the spot much better. Like I point out in the title, this is personal taste. Good luck."
5,Great book by great author,This book is a wonderful introduction to Indian Philosophy. It is not too fluffy but it is not so hard that it cannot be understood.
5,depth and truth,"I have several Talbot CDs and have listened to him for about 11 years. Besides The Hiding Place, this is the most profoundly simple and moving CD I've heard from him or anyone. Particularly the song ""God Alone is Enough."" The lyrics meaningfully state: ""God alone is enough. Whoever has God, wants for nothing at all."" These lyrics have affected me many times and the music is also very fitting. I recommend this CD without hesitation for anyone seeking a simple and true musical ministry experience."
5,The study Bible that needs to be brought back into print,"I have almost every Study Bible made and this one is one of the best. It is as good as any of the other ones on my short list of the best. The others I would recommend are the King James Study Bible by Nelson, The Ryrie Study Bible by Moody, The MacArthur Study Bible by Nelson, and The Geneva Study Bible by Nelson. Nelson please republish."
5,Detailed Figures,"It smells terrible when you get them out of their box. The pumpkin doesn't stay lit up on it's own, it lights up only when you press down on it's stem, it's still pretty neat. Young Michael is very well sculpted and painted, you can take his clown mask off completely. Michael is also very well sculpted, it almost looks like you can take off his mask. I don't like the drapery on him, but that's probably something not very many people would mind.Michael's arm fell off when I was putting the knife in his hand for the fifth time. I was being very gentle too! Anyway, it's back on now."
3,Alright,"I read the entire series so I liked it enough to keep reading, but I didn't love them. I'll probably try another book by this author though."
3,Too many distractions,"Plain & somewhat prudish El Paso local station manager almost has sex in hotel bathroom with attractive man who she finds out next day works for interested but ruthless buyer of their tv station. Although it started as a case of mistaken identity, hero goes on with the pretense that he just works for the buyer but regrets it when he becomes emotionally involved with heroine. BUT other things get in the way...like the Bachelor-type show they're trying to put on as last-ditch effort to save the station, his intrusive family, & her clamming up about her own childhood/family. Dialogue, various cast of characters, & plot got in the way of the romance.Romance & sexual chemistry would've been good if it wasn't for the overloaded plot & cast of characters. Reading it became annoying.Read if you don't have anything more interesting to read."
5,A wonderful distillation of a complex man,"Simply put, this is the finest of the Penguin Lives series. It gives Dr. King in simple sentences, does not ignore the complexities of his life, and does not indulge in the myth making of previous biographers. You get the man, with his failures, successes, obsessions and ironies, all in one tight package. Wonderful read."
1,What is the Point?,"First of all this book is a collection big English words which makes it impossible to fully understand huge parts of the book. It makes it very frustrating to read. Secondly, the impression you get from reading the book is the effort to discredit the works of MLK. Unbelievably all the book does is to attempt to 'cut him to size' so to speak. This is not a balanced book.It contradicts every book or story told about MLK. I do not recommend this book and wish I could take my money backI hate this book, yes I do"
2,A Pretty Little Atrocity,"This book begins with a sentence fragment arguing that the age of white racism and Southern apartheid seems like ancient history. It ends by implying that it was really all for the best that Dr. King was shot when he was shot, as he was ""passing irretrievably into decline."" The stuff in between these two whoppers is cribbed from a range of authors, all of whom are vastly more qualified than Frady to have written this book for Penguin Lives.Alas, I suspect Penguin is simply engaging in good marketing here. Yuppies buy most of the books, and this one is a perfect ego-stroke to yuppies. It lets you say you know something about MLK, without having your basic worldview challenged by a truthful presentation of his real meaning. Imagine Dr. King living to challenge our economic and political elites over several more decades. If you're smug and dumb enough to believe this wouldn't have mattered, you'll be happy to have Frady's tropes.The book is a serious miseducation."
2,Too much too fast,"I had two years of high school Spanish, and another year in college. When my husband and I started traveling, I wanted to relearn some of my Spanish. Even with the background I had, this audio was much too fast. I have persisted with listening daily, but have not had the progress I would have wanted because relatively difficult and unusable sentences are repeated quickly, then I won't hear them again until I get back to that section of the day in several days(I'm listening on the way to work, so don't back tape up). Some sentences are not translated, and individual words have to be figured out by elimination of the words you already know. This is definately not a beginner course, but may be helpful for someone who had been relatively fluent in Spanish and now wants a review. I am in the search for another (and better) tape, hopefully oriented toward the traveler who will need to make hotel reservations, arrange train travel, etc."
2,All-Audio Spanish Basic-Intermediate,"Before trying this course, I took the Berlitz introductory course and courses I and II by Pimsleur. I found both the Berlitz and Pimsleur courses better than this one. I agree with all the reviewers who didn't like it. This course is too heavy on discussing grammar and vocabulary and not heavy enough on practicing dialogue. It's easier to learn grammar and vocabulary from books. Audio tapes are more useful for practicing dialogue and pronuncation. The section in each lesson where you are asked to respond is too difficult for a beginner, and at the same time not very useful for an intermediate student, and it's much too short. Now I am trying Pasos 2 which at least has more dialogue to listen to, even though the speakers use slang and are difficult to understand."
5,Best words-and-phrases English/Spanish hip-pocket reference!,"Most useful for its size. The key 2000 of 20000+Spanish words are in caps. Concise, it doesn'twaste your time but gives you a best return onyour most precious investment -- your own effort.Its only real fault is that words referenced on theEnglish section (appropriately somewhat smallerthan the Spanish section) do not always appearin the Spanish section, and vice versa, thoughthis fault seems universal in English-Spanishreferences.The only English-Espanol reference I liked wellenough to send to our son in Peru."
5,"Serious, still easy to read book about a sad story!","albert c. veldhuis - november 11, 1998 Serious, still easy to read book about a sad story! It is because Ralph Anspach is a fine and honest story-teller with a great knowledge of human character, discernment and perseverance that he finally succeeded in getting the truth popped up. It is really unbelievable that ""certain people"" succeeded in cheating the world (read: their customers) for over 60 years while so often honest people have tried to tell the truth. Thanks to Ralph Anspach everyone can now read the true story of a game that is so well-known over the whole world and in so many countries even when this games DOES NOT HAVE THE RED BAR."
5,Great Color,"As a watch enthusiast, I can honestly say that one just doesn't find many yellow watches for women, which is what makes this watch all the more appealing. I would like to mention how pleased I am with the St. Moritz company for having the notion to make dive watches for women in as many colors as the watches they make for men. Well done.As for the watch, it's fairly standard. It has a timing bezel and date function, as well as very bright glow in the dark hands. I should mention that I don't scuba dive, so I have never tested the function of the watch at any considerable depth. I do snorkel, however, and so far the watch and the band have stood up well to salt water.Overall this is an attractive time piece. I recommend it for any outdoorsy sort of woman (or child, as another reviewer mentioned that he bought this for his son--I would have loved this when I was a kid) who can appreciate its eye-catching appearance."
3,"Loved the watch, BUT it didn't last long.","I bought this watch to have something to wear while exercising, which included water aerobics. I have small wrists and hands so often watches are just too big. This watch fit - although only on the tightest hole of the band - and it wasn't overwhelming - a perfect size for me. Wore it frequently, and got lots of comments and compliments on it. All was fine until about a week ago. I went swimming, and afterward I noticed that the crystal was fogged up and there were water droplets on the watch face. The watch stopped working three days later. I don't remember exactly how long ago I bought the watch - probably a little more than a year. By this time also, the watchband had started to crack and discolor. Nice watch while it lasted. For the price, I think it should have lasted longer."
5,Great Truck Cover,The cover was shipped very quickly and was easy to install. It fits perfectly! Great product at a fantastic price.
5,The best pair of shoes i've ever had,"This is the best pair of shoes i've ever had. True to size, true to width, true to comfort. Soft and light as a feather. High speed walking boots - all is exactly what i need. But this model even exceeded all my expectations. So i am just happy with it. I would highly recommend this product to all my friends."
2,Difficult to look at red character,This G-shock Black/Red has two letter Black and Red. Black is conventional but red character is very difficult to look at.Side window of second sign is little cheap.
3,very comfortable,"I bought these shoes for my husband. He thinks they are extremely comfortable, but thinks they could have looked a little more like leather."
3,What? No fava beans and chianti?,"I saw this movie on late night cable. It's a wonderful substitute for ""Silence of the Lambs"" when I'm too lazy to pull out the DVD. Plot is excruciatingly similar-female cop has to drop her psychological armor to gain the trust of a psycho killer in order to free a high profile victim (a relative of a politician no less). Tierney and Brody gave very good performances. Too bad the characters' motives made absolutely no sense. One curious point-the husband/captain was named Tim. Actor Terry Kinney who played him also plays Tim McManus on HBO's Oz. To be typecast as a cop named Tim..."
5,Gripping,"Witty, dark, twisted, thrilling. Maura Tierny (Primary Colors, Forces of Nature, News Radio) is great, and quite unlike you have ever seen her before, and Adrien Brody (Thin Red Line, Summer of Sam) is wonderful as the remorseless, calculating and manipulative psychopath."
1,Length is Very Different From The Picture,I ordered these and my boss ordered these and both of ours came way too big. They fit nothing like in the picture. Both of ours came down to our ankles.
2,You'd never guess it was the seventh edition,"The book was full of typos, just do a few problems and check the answers in the back if you don't believe me. I have never seen a seventh edition with so many mistakes. At times it was readable but more often it was not. I thought the last few chapters were very good, however. The flow of material seemed quite logical, but I thought some important things were not stressed enough. I just cannot justify giving this book less than two stars, or more than three."
1,Don't waste your time with this book,"First of all, there are so many mistakes and typos in this book that you will be quite confused reading it. Also, there are very few examples, and many of the numerical answers to the homework are just wrong - sometimes by orders of magnitude! The book may seem deceptively good, but try reading it. I gaurantee you that you will be confused. Some things just do not make sense, not because they are intrinsically hard to understand, but the text was poorly written. He does a poor job with being consistent, which further adds to the confusion. Furthermore, the book is quite dull. If you want to beleive the other reviewer, go ahead and waste your money. There are many other great textbooks out there. I actually rate this book 0 stars. Nobody should have to waste their money buying it and end up suffering as I did."
1,This book stinks,"This book is lousy. It reads like stereo instructions. There are virtually no useful example problems presented. Answers are provided only for some problems which require numerical solutions, and as far as we can tell, many of the numerical solutions are just plain wrong, while others are off by orders of magnitude."
3,Under the Black Flag,"In the first Chapter of this book the author David Cordingly lists some movie adaptations of Stevenson's ""Treasure Island.""Here's the last one:"". . . in 1990 Charlton Heston played Silver and his son played a somewhat older than usual Jim Hawkins.""In actuality Christian Bale (16 years old at the time) played Jim Hawkinsand the movie was DIRECTED by Charlton Heston's son Fraser Clarke Heston (who was 35 years old in 1990).This was a strange error for the author to make but probably doesn't reflect on his expertise regarding actual historical pirates. Robert Louis Stevenson doesn't mention the age of his fictional hero Jim Hawkins in ""Treasure Island"" although there's been speculation that he was perhaps 14 or 15 years old.Although Christian Bale was older than the other young actors who had played Hawkins previously, he gave a believable portrayal of the boy."
3,A good reference,"'Under the Black Flag' is a book containing the history of the pirates age (1600-1700's). The book focuses on the pirates of the Caribbean, but does reference pirates in the South China Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, and the coast of Africa.This book is a good resource regarding pirate legends and reality. Cordingly discusses a number of the main pirates including Blackbeard, Captain Kidd, and more. I found the facts interesting and the information on the legends and myths equally engaging.My only issue with the book was that it got a bit repetitive. The hanging of Captain Kidd is discussed in a couple of chapters, as one example. Cordingly does provide a great glossary regarding the old nautical terms. I had been looking for a book on the pirates, and this book fits the bill."
3,Frustratingly lifeless,"It is amazing that someone with as little interest in pirates (or, at least, in what interests other people about pirates) as Cordingly has could ever become such an expert on them. Instead of the skull and cross-bones, this book should just have one of the plain blue covers that are on the booklets that students use for written exams. It's not that I would prefer an inaccurate account of piracy. The facts about pirate life are actually just as romantic and exciting as the fiction. The problem is in the way Cordingly presents them. He should open the book with, ""I can even make PIRATES boring! Watch this:"" If only Cordingly had found someone with a pulse to collaborate in the writing of this book. Someone like me or anyone else who finds pirates interesting enough to have purchased UNDER THE BLACK FLAG. The side of a cereal box is written with more energy than this book."
5,Yoho ho and several bottles of rum!!,"It seems life as a pirate wasn't so bad! At least that is until you were caught by the authorities, such as they were. The adventurous life as depicted by fiction was almost the way it was - a little more sanitized and glorified, with pure motives ascribed to them. They were in fact the first democracy with leaders elected and deposed by popular vote on board each ship. They were also hard livers - drinking and carousing to great excess with rape and fighting sports to be savoured on the long voyages between continents and conquests! The worl is certainly better off without them but they certainly bring colour to history!!"
5,Under the Black Flag,"A most excellent perspective on thelives of some of the most notorious pirates in history; how theylived, and how they died. This book illustrates in fine detail thecircumstances of the times that enabled the freebooting rogues toplague the shipping lanes and islands of the world. Cordinglycovers not only the pirates themselves, but the political atmosphere,the living conditions of sailors upon the seas, the ships on whichthey sailed, and even the devices of torture used by the British navyand the pirates themselves. A rich history of heroes and villains."
4,Not your father's pirates...,"Well researched and very readable. Full of great stories and larger than life personalities, as well as common drudgery that was the life of a pirate. More pirate information than you can shake a stick at."
5,A History Major's Review,"As a child pirates fascinated me, but as a college student studying history I found that serious forays into the historical truth of piracy were few and far between. My boyhood fascination and adult inquisitive nature both found outlets in Under The Black Flag. The book is written with the general population in mind but has enough for historians to gain further insights into the lives of pirates.The book deals primarily with the pirates found in the Caribbean and North America, but gives brief accounts of pirate activity in the rest of the world as well. It profiles such figures as Blackbeard, Captain Kidd, Anne Bonney, Black Bart, and Calico Jack among others. The book even has a section on famous fictional pirates, reminding us of literary classics such as Long John Silver and Captain Hook.If you have ever wanted to learn more about Pirates, this is the book for you."
2,Cool cover,The book is a overview of pirates. I was expecting a more in depth knowledge of some of the more famous pirates. Some interseting facts but not in depth enough for me.
4,very interesting,"Good book, would buy it as a gift for a young person or a casual reader. Not to academic, but not to kiddie either. Lots of interesting info on the real deal of pirates. Worth the money."
2,Avoid these shores...,"I agree with the previous pans of this book. Ridiculously repetitive, poorly organized, largely dependent on secondary sources, Under the Black Flag has little to recommend it. Cordingly takes an inherently interesting subject- the reality of the Caribbean pirates- and finds a way to make it boring. Furthermore, the ponderous writing style and endless digressions on the image of the pirate in literature, the stage or screen soon overshadow the few good stories the book contains. There have to be better books out there on pirates."
5,Jolly Roger of a good book,"Cordingly has done his homework on the subject of the pirates. The text is very informative, historically acurate, and an easy read.You will learn all there is to know about these sea rogues. The author seperates fact from fiction that helps paint a clearer picture of those who sailed under the black flag. He dispells a variety of myths that surround some of the most famous pirates including Blackbeard and Captain Kidd. Cordingly takes you back to a vanished age when pirates ruled the seas. You'll journey with them across the oceans and share in their adventures,living the life of a pirate. Tally Ho!!!"
4,Nice book until the dog ate it,This is an interesting book filled with I what believe to be facts and some fiction about pirates. It was an easy read and could be used for research. Just keep it out of th the reach of little dogs
3,Informative but boring,"There is a lot of information in this book, and after reading it I no longer have any illusions that pirate life was romantic. However, I did have to force my way through it all because it was a very boring read. The book has it's moments, but it made me experience lethargy more than anything else. I was disappointed, because I had a keen interest in pirates and was expecting a much more engrossing book. I was relieved when I finally reached the last page."
4,Good but.....,"It's hard rating this book because on the one hand the subject matter is so fascinating and wonderful to read about, but on the other hand, the author's writing style is overworked and, at times, sloppy. I didn't mind the abundance of footnotes, but his language seemed unnecessarily florid. It was however, filled with interesting facts and did not have TOO much conjecture (which I hate in history books, just the facts please!). I've read several other books on Mozart which had mainly focused on his later Vienna years, so I will say that it was enjoyable to find out so much about the whole ""wunderkind"" years. So I recommend this book for serious lovers of Mozart, but it may not be the best choice for the casual fan looking for a fun read."
2,Back pedal,"I used this book after I completed a week long NCLEX review session to test myself and evaluate if the review was helpful. I scored just as poorly on the practice tests before as after the review course. The questions are outdated and the strategies given to me by the review intructor were not beneficial in taking these particular test questions. I thought some the questions were flawed and the answers sometimes just plain incorrect, as well as typos, which makes one wonder if the correct answers were typos. Also, the rationales are vague and do not fully explain why incorrect answers are incorrect. Very frustrating."
2,Probably great back in the day...,"This book is too old today to be useful as prep for the current NCLEX-RN. It was published in 1999. The test was reformatted last year or the year before and is much, MUCH harder than it used to be, so most NCLEX prep books published more than two years ago have questions that are much easier than anything current. The best use for this book is for nursing students who are in the first half of their program, and have not had a lot of content yet. The level of the questions are appropriate for, say, a sophmore in a baccalaureate program. A better choice for someone taking the NCLEX-RN would be just about any NCLEX prep book published in 2005 or 2006. Only buy this book if you are starting a nursing education program and want some basic questions.My other gripe is that although the book boasts ""over 2,000 questions,"" many of them repeat throughout the 17 tests. And they need a proofreader."
2,OK -- not very intuitive and poorly supported software.,"I've owned this scanner for about two years. I bought it because it also offered a document feeder for photos and business cards, as well as negative and slide capabilities. The document feeder sporadically works and jams often -- not worth the effort.Also, the software provided was on a CD and works ONLY with Windows XP. While Epson provides updated software, another five companies also provided software for the scanner. One, Smart Panel, is almost critical to the scanner. Unfortunately, Epson doesn't support the software and refers the customer to another software company (Newsoft).I'd recommend going with another company that offers better support for their product."
2,Problems with print driver,"This scanner is fast and scans well when it works. Problem is I have to reinstall the drivers every time I use it. However, the last time I went to use it even installing the drivers wouldn't start it. Real frustrating."
3,Really Good Scanner for about 18 months,"For a while, this 2480 was a really good scanner and buy for light usage. Now after 18 months of ownership, there are cloudy markings on the underside of the glass from 2 to 4 inches in that makes that part of the glass unusable.I really like the software and quality of scans, and I am thinking about buying another Epson 2480 if they can be had for under $99."
3,Casts shadows,"My 6 year old trusty Umax scanner was starting to show its age, so i looked for a new scanner that had good reviews. The Epson Perfection 2480 seemed to be one of the best rated.I use my scanner a few times a week for scanning graphic art.I have found this scanner to be disappointing compared to my old Umax. I find I get cast shadows around my images, so much so, that I took it in for repairs after having it only 3 months. All the major parts that could have been causing the problem were replaced, but I still have the problem, so I assume it is a builit in defect.Too bad. I will probably look for a better scanner for my needs."
5,Good for birds and other animals!,I love Kaytee products on a whole for my parakeets. I have two parakeets and I only have to change theyre bedding twice a month. Kaytee is a great product because they carry a great portion size bag so you dont have to keep running out to purchase more bedding in the middle of the month.
3,Good alternative bedding,I decided to switch to this kind of bedding since there is less dust which in turn is better for our Guinea Pigs. At the time I ordered this our local store only had a different brand of bedding and was more expensive. I took some stars away because now our store does carry this brand at a much better value. I would highly recommend this to others if you can't find it at your local stores.
5,Must READ!!!!!,It's a great book and i think everybody should read it. IN my own life it really helped me a lot.
4,"Faith Inspiring...Faith Increasing,","Tremendous testimonies of God interacting with people in their daily lives, of Him being a very present help in the time of trouble and of Him rescuing His creation from self-destruction.After reading it you'll have no doubt that God not only knows what you're going through, but that He cares and is able to change your life."
3,"sweet, but flawed","A warming introduction to some themes of caring for livestock, but... Some of the rhymes are forced, ie lambs don't ""creep"" just because the author needs a rhyme for sheep... and ... My dad would've killed those mice in the corn; otherwise they and their descendants would have eaten it all up.I recommend it only if your child can't get enough of farm books and has sources that are more accurate. When s/he is a little older, share Farmer's Boy by Laura Ingalls Wilder."
1,Don't buy any Honeywell of this style,Honeywell thermostats of this design have pins in the back that fail to connect properly after a couple of battery changes. They will not last.Save your money and buy something else.I have two of these and they both lose their memory every time they are touched. Bad connection coupling design.
2,too offensive,"although I am a big onion fan, this collection is particularly trashy. dead baby jokes. f-- k and other language."
1,not funny,"I saw all the rave reviews, and bought it. But it just wasn't funny. Maybe it's me, but I can't understand how people enjoy this."
4,Perfect for my 17 year old,"My son LOVES the Onion, and this was a great way to see the headlines of previous years twisted as always for hilarity. Finest indeed!"
3,"Too much ""stupid"" and not enough funny","If you've read Our Dumb Century, you probably will be disappointed by this book if you're looking for something similar. Instead of being filled with funny parodies of historical events and attitudes, this book a lot of mindless ""filler"" (for example, an article titled ""Me like being battery!"" written by a 9-volt battery on how much it loves to deliver power!) I would look at a copy before buying to make sure that this is what you really want (and, if you haven't bought Our Dumb Century, why don't you?)"
4,a fun parody,"This book is absolutely hilarious! Be warned, it is only for people with a sense of humor, as the material is sometimes offensive. But most of it is parody, meaning humor with a social point"
5,Funny -- a great book!,"The Onion is so-o-o-o-o funny. It's my uplift each week. Entertaining, captivating, fun journalism. But head warning: This isn't your grandmother's produce."
4,Alpine CDA-9885,"I bought this in 2007 and it has served me well.Pros- Outstanding sound, great looks. Cons- The time change setting is not intuitive and tricky to use. The ipod jack is located on the back of the unit. I had it I installed without one and am out of luck.Great sounding and looking deck with a poor a ipod jack set up configuration. It's frustrating to change the time through the controls. Everyone I have exposed it to agrees that it sounds fantastic."
4,"Smart, funny debut","This weddingland memoir takes the modern-day nuptial industry to task with a sense of humor and honesty that is unrelenting. By recounting her own experiences as a bride-to-be, Hana Schank illustrates how the ""manufactured need"" pawned by industry magazines, shops and web sites turns perfectly independent and cosmopolitan women (like her) into obsessive denizens of the commercial culture. The author's capacity for self-depreciation not only helps to illustrate wedding excesses and absurdities (she spends weeks tying fancy ribbons for her save-the-date cards), but it makes her a very likable companion for the book's 211 pages. This is a deft and entertaining read, whether you're married, single or somewhere in-between."
5,Best book for teaching shapes,I attribute our daughter's early learning of shapes (including more difficult ones) to this book. The book has beautiful photos of Wegman's dogs with various items that show what a shape is. There is only one concept per page. The pictures are not cluttered. The dogs are cute & amusing. It was one of the best book purchases we made in the preschool years.
4,Psychodynamics,This was a mandatory book for one of my college courses. It is about theories and applications. It is not very fun to read but it is highly informational and not too hard to understand.
2,wouldnt play on 360,"this game does not play on th new xbox 360 like many of the other original xbox games do, so beware in your purchase"
4,Way cheaper than Big Orange Box store!,"If you are looking to purchase this at HD, they charge almost $80 for it! Great programmable thermostat. Works for me!"
5,Simple and straight forward,"First I must admit that I have installed zero thermostats in my life. I was more than a little hesitant about buying one and 'taking the plunge' for installation. No worries however. I had downloaded the 'quick start' guide and installing could not have been easier. Turn power off, disconnect old thermostat, match wires with color, attach to wall, turn on power. It really was that simple. The physical buttons are a definite advantage for this model (the next model up has 'virtual' buttons). The logic of how the 4 time periods (wake, leave, return, sleep) were a little confusing at first, but once you figure out one day, you can copy it to the rest of the week. If you're looking for a basic 7-day thermostat, look no further."
4,Easy to install - easy to use.,"I replaced a manual old style mercury Honeywell thermostat with this one. I loved the description how to disassemble and old one, how to mark the wires etc and how to hook up properly the new one. 30mins later, everything was installed, setup and worked perfectly."
5,Works like a champ,"Haven't had it that long, but have had no problems with it. It was easy to install & easy to program. I especially like it switching between heating & cooling automatically when needed which saves having to go to the thermostat when it needs to be switched."
1,"Crappy product, even worse customer service","Installed the product in December...by August the display had failed. Amazon said to contact Honeywell, so I did and it is now September 27th (almost two months later) and I still do not have a resolution to the faulty product! Multiple calls have been made with wait times upwards of 20-30 minutes each time. This product comes with a one year warranty...I guess it is going to take a year to fulfill the warranty claim. As is the case with a lot of American companies, their customer service and technical support lines all seem to be outsourced.If I were you, I would avoid Honeywell all together. I know this is hard when looking at thermostats, but there has to be something else better out there!"
5,Very Happy So Far,"We bought this elsewhere, but I've been so impressed, I had to leave my two cents.Installation took about 15 minutes for my DIY husband. He failed at the scheduling, however. I was able to program it without even reading the booklet. Yeah for me! This actually has more options than I need. It has: wake, leave, return, sleep. I love that it controls the heat and a/c. Our old model was not programmable and required that you slide a switch between a/c and heat. I don't miss that old thing at all.Although I haven't received the first electric bill since installing it, I'm certain it will save money. Far too many days someone (me) would forget to bump up the temp during the day, wasting tons of energy and money. I'm sure this will pay for itself in a single summer here, maybe even a single month!"
5,Works as Advertised,"This is my second programmable thermostat. Years ago, I purchased the Lux TX500E. That thermostat also worked as advertised... for a while. After a few years of use, the override buttons stopped working as expected. We had to pound on the override buttons in order to manually change the temperature.I am happy with this Honeywell model. I was able to quickly swap out the old thermostat, and programming was really easy. I was pleased to discover that I could program multiple days in one shot, which allowed me to program weekdays all at once, and weekends all at once."
4,Easy to install,"I found this thermostat on sale here at Amazon, just in time because my old thermostat's LCD was failing. I had never removed or installed one before so I was a little nervous, but it really was as easy as the description says it is. Took about 15 minutes just as described. Instructions are clear and easy to follow. It definitely helps if you are handy with tools (I am) but even if you aren't, as long as you can figure out how to use a screwdriver and a drill, you should be fine. The display is big and bright, and the system is easy to navigate. No complaints. So far it has been working fine."
4,Great device - but take care when installing!,"I love my new Honeywell! It does exactly what I want it to do and it is so easy to operate. Plus, it looks pretty cool on my wall. I had heard how easy it was to install, and it was easy(ish) but no cake walk. The biggest problem I faced was removing my old dial from the wall, matching up the wires, and then installing them properly into the new thermostat. The wires didn't exactly match the instructions so there was a little trial and error before success. I haven't received my first full gas bill yet, but I'm hoping that I see a little savings. I definitely recommend this product!"
1,DON'T,"Cumbersome programming, lousy, confusing, inaccurate instructions and the backlight does not stay on long enough do any real programming. I give it one star becuase I can't give it none."
5,Saved $400 in one month,"We installed three of these thermostats in our church fellowship hall/gym the last weekend in December. We replace manual thermostats that were frequently being left on. Our previous utility bill was over $600 for the holidays, November and December. We got our current utility bill this weekend for December-January. It was less than $200. The weather was the coldest we've had in North Alabama in several years.We have two 5-2 programmable thermostats in our sanctuary. Based on the savings experienced in the fellowship hall we are replacing the 5-2 thermostats with these 7-day thermostats.Installation was pretty simple. We did call Customer Support on a Saturday morning to get details on the ""no battery"" option. It is mentioned on the packaging but the instructions did not say anything about it. Turned out, we did not have the required wiring for that option. Our experience with batteries in other thermostats is that they last about a year."
3,bad honeywell advice re aux heat display,"I have a gas fired conventional furnace with 2 stage heating. I have no cooling system. My old Luxpro displayed which stage of heating was being used. Before purchasing this thermostat I called Honeywell to see if this unit would display both stages. He said yes. He did not ask what kind of furnace I had so I did not offer it.Upon reading the install manual it says the 2nd stage indication is ony available with heat pumps having aux. heat.I then emailed Honeywell with my issue, asking for a possible workaround. After 3 days they have not replied to my email.Otherwise the unit is fine. I suspect the battery life issue mentioned elsewhere is related to the backlight. I do not have a ""C"" (house power) connection coming from the furnace. My old luxpro had no backlight and in 7 years I never once replaced the batteries. I'm planning on checking these more frequently, since it is not possible to control this thermostat without turning on the backlight."
2,Honyewell RTH7500D,"I dont like it, it not hard to set it up, but the one i got was broken and few times at night will drop the temperature in the room to 60 and we live in Chicago area. Frizzing cold for me. I call Honyewell and the guys are very help full, but i was not able to return mine so i have to buy a new one. Honywell offer to sand me a new one for free, but i just want a simple one now so i dont have to run @ the same problem."
5,Awesome Product,I have been wanting to get a programable thermostat for a long time. I am glad I finaly did. This product is awesome. Very easy to install and program. Keeps the house at the temprature I set. It has programs for all 7 days of the week and 4 different time periods. Makes it very easy to take advantage of rate changes throughout the day.
5,Works Great!,I have been wanting a programmable thermostat for some time. This model has been great so far! Our first gas bill was almost half of what it was the previous year for the same time period. It is very easy to program and install. The individual day programming is nice as is the filter reminder. We have been very happy.
3,No Vacation mode,I really like this thermostat and it's been a great replacement but I was displeased to realize there is no vacation mode. I think this is a must have feature - otherwise you have to reprogram the device anytime you leave for an extended period and return.
2,two failed,"After the move back to Eastern Standard time this year, both failed within one month of each other. Something about the time change, which did not replicate through the thermostat. They still work somewhat, but not like they did when new. They require a lot of tweaking and manual override. I am replacing both."
2,Glasses Needed,"This thermostat worked and then didn't work on my system within one week. Also, the screen is so small that you need a magnifying glass to see the screen.Needless to say, I returned it. Amazon was prompt with my refund."
2,pins came loose,We've had our unit for over a year. The pins that connect the thermostat to the wall unit have become loose and the thermostat can no longer communicate or be effective (I'm writing this while wrapped in a blanket and waiting for the hardware stores to open). We'll probably try to find a unit that is better made.
2,Honeywell RTH7500,"The RTH7500 was fairly easy to install but the screen went blank in less than 6 months. We replaced the batteries three times and nothing! It is supposed to have a one year warranty! We contacted Honeywell customer care and after several phone calls and emails dragging out for over three weeks,we still do not have the issue resolved! Glad I kept the old thermostat! The worst customer service I have ever dealt with! Bye Bye Honeywell!"
3,Bad experience (defective unit) with a good thermostat,"We purchased this model and were initially very happy with it's performance. However, three times this month, the unit shuts down, the screen goes blank, and the A/C is off. We have to press any key to bring the screen back to life, at which point, the thermostat is in ""compressor protection mode"" (a built-in 5-minute delay). Calls to the thermostat help line at Honeywell were fruitless -- they suggested that maybe the battery was dead or installed with reverse polarity. Neither was the case. We are currently on the phone with Honeywell headquarters trying to get a replacement for this defective unit.We like the thermostat -- when it's working -- because it is easy to program, but because of this problem, I can give it only 3 stars.(Honeywell has agreed to send a replacement! Well done, Honeywell!)"
1,"Bad product, poor service.","You get what you pay for and heating your house is not the place you should skimp on. 10pm and this thing is broken, it's going to cost you an arm and a leg to get a repair man out, trust me, I know. Called customer service and talked to a nice gentleman in India that I could barely understand. What I did make out was that my thermostat was broken and it was two months out of the warranty period, so ""please purchase another quality Honeywell product"". My advice to you is spend a little more money on the furnace manufacturers recommended thermostat (trust me it is not a Honeywell) and it will do a much better job to keep you and your family warm for years."
4,Good for what I need,"This Honeywell thermostat was easy to install. It does short out every once in a while. I'm not sure if it is my problem or the thermostat. It hasn't bothered me enough to send it back, yet.The one negative I see in the design is that the buttons are not very intuitive. I guess I'm spoiled by iphones and other intuitive devices. This device just doesn't compare."
4,Works well with a heat pump,"This T-stat is compatible with a variety of Heat/AC systems. Installation is not too difficult. It's important to pay attention to the instructions. Be sure to tag your wires before disconnecting your old t-stat. We took a photo of ours before disconnecting which helped.It functions well. The interface is a little quirky but its easy to figure out and become familiar with it. The programming feature will be nice to use, but not sure if I will have use for the auto changeover feature in our climate.The display is somewhat cheap looking but it is easy to read which was one reason why we upgraded to this product.When we opened the package we discovered that Honeywell covers the display with a sticker that leaves a heavy residue. It took 15 or 20 minutes of light, careful scrubbing with WD-40 and soft cloth to remove it.Very satisfied with this purchase."
4,Great purchase,This was relatively easy. The product came. I installed it the same day. The only thing that gave me trouble were the tiny screws I had to loosen that were attaching the four wires. One came off easy and the others were too tight. I finally got vise grips to use with the tiny screw driver and that did the trick. Took about 30 - 45 minutes. If the screws had not been so stubborn it would have been easier. I try to do most of the repairs here myself. My husband has Alzheimer's so we are very careful with our purchases. Thank you.
3,useful information,"Itay Gil is widely recognised as an authority on anti-terrorist measures and close combat. His book, unsurprisingly doesn't disappoint, although anyone with a background in these areas may not find anything new. Very readable and he tells-it-like-it-is, with no BS. With the current conflicts and spread of global terrorism, the information detailed in this book may prove to be very useful, although anyone wishing to really develop their skills in close combat should consider joining a Krav Maga class."
2,DIAMOND LIVE ?,"This is a new live album but I agree I would have liked a few more old songs from the vault as it were. As for live, well erm yes. I can't help but feel that this sounds like a studio album with a backing track of a live audience. Now I understand that loops and backing traxs are an acceptable part of modern rock shows however I feel like I am listening to the original studio recordings. So I think this CD works better as a recent greatest hits. I am sure the negative votes are gonna start up as soon as this is posted, and unfortunately I haven't ever had the honour of seeing the band live, and if they do play this well then it will be a fine experience. Only once we get to the tail end of disc two do you feel there is a genuine live feel. Why, oh why we have to endure ""No Presents"" (again) is beyond me when you consider the depth of work the man has to offer. But I'll say it again I don't believe for one moment that this was recorded predominantly live. Sorry."
2,Sounds like a studio album with crowd noise,"The problem with this album is not that it sounds bad, it just somehow ended up with a production nearly identical to Puppet Master's. Not only does it sound way too polished, there's also all these overdubs on the vocals. There's really no reason to listen to it if you own the albums. In Concert Abigail is a much more relevant live disc."
5,Track Listing:,1. Walk On The water2. To The Cross3. Satisfied4. Old Ship Of Zion5. Then Came The Morning6. He Took The Chains7. He Was There All The Time8. Home At Last9. Lay It Down10. BrotherThese are the tracks on this CD.
4,Gospel for a new generation,"This is great! Who is going to carry the torch when the Bill Gaither's of the world leave and go on to heaven? It's great to hear younger voices take up the old sound with fresh ideas to southern gospel music. I cannot believe how deep the bass travels up and down your spine with valor worships. A great cd just for that fact alone, not to mention the well writen music. Check it out!"
3,"Interesting addition to ""Arnhem"" literature","This is a well-written addition to the extensive literature on the battle of Arnhem. It is part of Cassell's Fields of Battle Series (another in this series is Gettysburg by Hugh Bicheno).The author tells the story from the point of view of those incommand - both Allied and German. He points out the things that went wrong on the Allied side and stresses how well the Germansreacted to emergency situations. The Allied troops were well-trained elite soldiers while the Germans were, quoting from theForeword by Richard Holmes (the series editor), ""a heterogeneousmixture of the untrained, the convalescent and the worn out "".There are good photographs (some very graphic) and good maps andplans. Altogether a very good book."
2,I wanted it to be good,"I only recently dumped the disks for this game. MOO2 was fantastic and I looked forward to this being much the same.Unfortunately, I found it heavily convoluted. It was overwhelmed by getting down into the nitty gritty of every planet you owned and I could not handle it.There was a certain amount of AI you could put in charge, but you had to check up on it to keep it in line. Fighting also left a lot to be desired. Most of the time I found my tail getting whipped, even with superior numbers.I would say, go back to MOO2 or get Space Empires 5. It was much closer to a inheritor of the MOO legacy."
2,Too much Micro-management,Lost in translation moment in what was an otherwise excellent space strategy series. MOO3 has an overdose of menus and build/management screens that pulls you out of the game and kills the enjoyment factor. I still pray for a rebirth for this title.
3,Maybe I am just slow,But I can't make any sense of this game. I loved MOO2 and was excited about the graphics/ more you could do in this version. But it was kind of a chore to play. Maybe they need to try again!
1,Do NOT Buy the Honeywell Heat Only Round Thermostat,"Where do I begin? With it's inaccurate thermometer? With it's ridiculously inadequate screw terminals for the wall wires that a breath would dislodge and that one would need a magnifying glass to deal with? (You need jewelers screwdrivers for this!) Or with it's inscrutable wall mount plate? Perhaps I don't have to begin at all because I'm finished with Honeywell. Very often, difficulties with installation come from not reading directions. I took the time to read the directions and an installation that should have taken 10 or 15 minutes - took me nearly twice that long.My advice: Go with ANY brand other than a Honeywell Round Thermostat."
3,Thermostat is OK,"This thermostat is OK. It gives a low reading by 1 to 2 degrees, which is as good as any other thermostat I've had.My problem is that Honeywell seems to think that everybody only owns new homes. The instruction say, if your wire colors don't match the colors on the thermostat use the chart they provide. But what if your wire colors don't match the chart? Well start guessing, 'cause Honeywell didn't provide for that option. My house was built in 1967 and the only color that matches is white. If you do a search of home project web sites, you'll see many others have the same problem.I don't expect Honeywell to provide for every possible situation, but don't ignore us, like it's not possible to have wire colors that don't match the current standard. It would be helpful to describe how to figure out the correct wiring hookup."
1,"AWFUL PRODUCT, STAY AWAY","Folks, stay away from this, I have bought it and installed 3 different units in the span of 1 day(3 separate purchases and returns to local Home Depot) and all were defective, with the third one I also picked up a 3M brabnd thermostat unit, and it worked, I even called a Honeywell customer support, they guided me thru troubleshooting points and the rep said himself, that it ids a defective unit. Lost 7 hours of my time to realize to buy a different brand. the inevitable conclusion-inferior outsorced - to - China - product."
2,Returned for low indication of thermometer function.,"My mistake I guess, for not buying digital. I demand high tolerance indicators in everything I am reading in life.I returned this thermostat because it was indicating 3+ degrees low. I would expect a 1-2 degree tolerance, but when compared to 2 known digital accurate indicators it was low. The Honeywell website product details states ""Precise Temperature Control- +/-1F accuracy for maximum comfort"". Actually, this does not say thermometer accuracy or tolerance. I call the Honeywell tech support, and he first stated 1-2 degrees, but when I told him mine was 3 degrees low, he backed off, and started explaining that the temperature control was more accurate, and tried to tell me that 3 degrees was OK. WTF?He recommended the digital RTH111b if I wanted more accuracy. I have found the RTH111b for a little less money from the same store."
1,Disapointing,"I bought one of these to replace an old Honeywell round. It is so inaccurate even the thermometer in the bottom part does not register right. Probably because there is no vent for the room air to enter the unit to sense the degrees. Honeywell should recall these units before their reputation is trashed, as this crap should be!!"
4,Honeywell stuck on 65 degrees,The thermostat doesn't show room temp. Either broken or defect. not sure. Seems to be stuck on 65 degrees ambient room temp. Setting the furnace temp is fine.
3,Feels/looks very cheap,"My plumber brought some of these to my house to ""upgrade"" my old thermostats. I had to ask him to take them back. They instantly looked cheap when I took one out of the box, and the feel of the dial was too loose and vague in my opinion. I can't say for sure accurate its dial is, but I'd guess +/-5-degrees or worse, just because of the sloppy feel. The clear plastic is also very hard with ""sharp"" edges, which also made it feel cheap. I popped the top to look inside... not much in there. I'd guess this thing cost $2 to manufacture, and the rest is going to fluff some exec's chair at Honeywell's corp. office. ;-) Note that this review is in contrast to my review of their digital round version (CT8775A1007), which looks and feels very nice. (Overall I think *all* thermostats are overpriced for what they do... It's just a switch!)"
1,Never recieved it!,"I am currently disputing this. Apparently the item was delivered to Tennessee, problem is I live in San Diego, Ca. but they still charged me. Not happy since it was supposed to be part of a gift basket! I would actually not rate the product but it made me give some type of star rating!"
5,really good,I ordered this book for my testing and I really like it.It had all the info I wanted and helped me a lot!
4,good,good book if practicing by self to show off if you want to spar with someone it dosent provide the expirence recomended to those who want to show off to those who dont know how to do it themselves
3,Covers everything but could be better organised,"This is a good book. It covers all the basic stances, strikes and blocks. It normally gives the english name of a technique after the Japanese name, but not always. For someone with my limited memory, I would have liked an index to the techniques, so when the book refers to one I've forgotten, I can quickly find it. But it doesn't have an index so I spend a lot of time flicking back and forward.Also, the descriptions are very wordy. Instead of just saying 'Execute an XYZ strike', it describes every step every time, which make the combination moves and kata very long winded."
4,Excellent begineers book,"This book is an excellent choice for anyone interested in learning the bo. It shows every basic movement in a clear, precise manner. It contains information on all attacks, blocks, stances, and grips.The only downfall of it, is that it lacks in forms (katas). It shows one form at the end, but unfortunately the form is very boring. Having a couple more forms would have made this a 5 star book."
5,Bo or Staff,"My brother has the first (original) publishing of this book. When we were kids, we self-taught ourselves martial arts weapons. In the 1970s and 1980s most Karate, Tae Kwon Do schools did not teach weapons unless you reached brown, red, or black belt. So we bought this book to teach ourselves. Although I specialized in the nunchuckau, my brother loved the staff.Fumio Demura is a karate legend. His books are easy to follow and understand. This is a MUST HAVE book if you are learning the Staff, Kwon, or Bo. And everyone should learn how to use a staff.... lots of the techiniques can be used whether you have a staff, broom stick, mop, long umbrella, or cane.I bought this book again to teach my daughters. Get the book over the DVD. We bought both, because I thought the DVD would help more. But the DVD doesn't do justice for the student."
3,"Nice, but no need to buy.","Firstly, I love minimalism. The two quotes at the beginning of this book sum up what is wonderful about minimalism rather nicely, and I encourage you to read them (at the book store). Secondly, some of the exibits in this book are really fantastic, especially the Japanese projects. I found a lot of inspiration looking at these designs, and the photography is mostly great.BUT, you really don't need to buy this particular book. I suggest Minimalist Houses over this particular collection because it has a lot more variety, and greater international representation (eg. you'll see more from Germany, Sweedan, the U.S. and Japan) for about the same price. Minimalist Spaces is a nice book, but read it the store as an appetizer for Minimalist Houses, if minimalism appeals to you. Some people are uncomfortable with minimalism, and there are plenty of books and designs for you too :)."
3,The Controversy Continues,"I've read four books on this subject, and EVERY ONE of them says different things about what is acid and what is alkaline. Even the people who are supposed to be researching and studying this thoroughly don't know what is going on, but they pass the information on anyway and expect us to follow and believe it? In addition, if what all these people are saying is true, then half the American population should be dead. Period. There is no way a human being should be able to live eating the typical American diet of junk food and very little fruits/veggies, smoking, drinking, etc.There is health-promoting info in here, however, but that is just basic common sense: Eat more fruits/veggies, drink more water, and cut down on meats and alcahol, etc. Because of that, I'll give it a decent rating, but don't expect to find any hard answers in this, or any other book of its kind."
4,Book,This book was easy to obtain on Amazon.com. I had a hard time finding it in a regular book store. It was also cheaper.
1,"dumb, dumb dumb","This is nonsensical foolishness. I am a chemistry professor- (Organic, Biochemisty, toxicology) The book is a load of cr*p. There is no scientific basis for much of anything in the book. Plain and simple it is a scam."
1,it was like i died reading it.,"Not a fun read. It did not keep my interest at all. I wish I purchased another book with the same topic with more ""UMPH!"""
4,Information for all ages,"This book is very easy to read, very informative too! Dr. Baroody explains how an alkaline body is a healthy body, he also gives solutions to many health issues. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to be healthy."
3,Interesting book but not referenced well,"The book provided some interesting insight, but it wasn't referenced well. The author could have done a great service to the topic if he took the time to provide references for the claims he made."
3,Is it true?,"I wonder how true this...your stomach has a very acid environment to protect us and to help digest food. Then the food goes into the small intestine where the body makes an alkaline environment (using bile etc). All the digestion products then go to the liver for more processing. Also the human blood stream is kept at pH 7.35-7.45 via complex buffering (bicarbonate ion etc).Also, the kidneys remove excess acids of alklaline substances. So is it truethat we must eat alkaline when the body is both acid and alkaline inside?"
1,new religion,"If you're looking for a new religion, or want to read about how to live to be 200 years old, Alkalize or Die might be the book for you. If you want useful information about how to shift your diet to more alkalizing foods, you should look elsewhere, because this book doesn't have that."
2,Don't waste your time or money,"The title says it all. The food chart is worth a few bucks. The book is not well written. I may try to sell it on amazon marketplace. Too much fluff, religious points of view etc. When I buy a book on nutrition, I'm looking for good science, not someone's religious/philosophical points of view."
4,Alkalize or Die,"Bood arrived quickly and in excellent shape. I have not had a chance to read the entire book, although what I have read, I am enjoying the newfound knowledge I have gained. I have several books on this subject by different authors, and each one has differences in their approach and diet. I am hoping to find the best alkalizing diet that will work for me and one that I will be able to live with for a long time."
1,Alkalize or Die claims people in India are living to 140 years old ?!,There is no credible evidence that says people are living beyond 122 years old as recorded historically. Why is this author claiming people are living to be 140? seems very dubious. This book does not seem credible and is full of chemisty jargon probably purposely meant to confuse. The only good advice is to eat more fruits and veggies and drink more water but that is free common advice.
4,Alkalize or Die,"I am still in full-time employment,and normally it takes me some time to read anything, and especially something as comprehensive as this book.I have read a lot of similar books and it is comforting to note that these books link in with their findings.I think the way forward is to use this book as a well-thumbed reference book, and slowly conform to its preachings."
2,Who is this guy?,"His background is an interesting alternative health almalgamation. The name of his book, ""Alkalize or Die"", is in itself a marketing scare tactic. As in similar books, I don't see much in the way of hard data to back up the claims made. There are a few pearls, but mostly sand, in this slim paperback. Most of the foods mentioned as being acid-reducers are known to be good for you anyways. I just don't see anything revolutionary. The last 37 pages of the book, the guy is trying to peddle questionable alternative health products. Clever marketing scheme, first I will scare you into buying my book, then I'll sell you a bunch of products to 'save' you from dying.."
4,Alkalize od Die,I have enjoyed reading this book and have refered sections of it's findings. Some area's are for dedicated grass eaters and slightly obsessive. I am glad I have it in my library and will refer to it in years to come.
5,GROL Plus: A Must Have Book!,"I just took my GROL this past week and could not have possibly passed it without this book. This book is great. It provides you with all the possible questions the test givers can ask you and provides detailed answers for every question. Plus, you get the same info for the Element 8, the Ship Radar Endorsement. I took all three elements on the same day and passed every one of them with ease. Trust me! Your money will not be wasted!"
5,Good Book to Pass the FCC GROL test,This book is great for studying for the GROL test. I used this book and www.fcctests.com website for practice test to pass the test.
3,OK,"This book rather than teaching the principles, teaches the question pool. It goes through question by question, just giving the answer and an extremely brief explanation, if any explanation at all. All of the material is covered, however, the book seems best suited for someone with previous radio and/or electronics experience."
5,Great,I like all Gordo material. I used his manuals to pass my amateur radio exams from Tech to Advanced operator. I look forward to passing the GROL exams.
2,the other side...,If Alice Deejay had an ounce of credibility this would have been her release. It sounds like 2001. It's dancey pop music. It's not electro in any way.I will try to never listen to this cd again. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because the production value is above average.I can see why young girls like this. I may give it to my niece.
1,Very deceiving...,I ordered the cargo liner that I thought the picture represented. I got a small liner to fit behind the 3rd seat row. That's NOT what the picture shows and no where on the page are measurements given. This is extremely misleading and I'm very disappointed!!
4,Great protection,This cargo liner was purchased for a 2009 Toyota Sienna. It fits perfectly and the raised sides will keep most any spill contained. Amazon had the best price on the net for this liner. No need to shop any further.
5,Duke Levine rips,"Duke Levine struts some hot licks and incredible tones on Country Soul Guitar. The title of the cd says it all, soulful country with outstanding musicianship.This isn,t your typical truck stop country either,it's engaging instrumentals that will make guitar officianados drool."
4,Nice Product,Worked very well for my wife in her shop. One or two of the screw holes were locaterd in a spot to make it very difficult to mount. I think I only used 2 of them because of this. Still worked well though
4,Is it what's really that bad that makes this book so good?,"In beginning Twain's ""King Leopold's Soliloquy"", one immediately notices how wordy Twain is. Yet, the context plays a major role in portraying the oddity of how the king actually thought his cruelty was well deserved. This book is pure genius when it comes to irony and sarcasim. One of Twain's most horrid yet thought provoking novels."
2,I wish this was made of Metal...,I wish this keychain was made of metal instead of plastic/rubber cause while it was sitting in my car it eventually warped faded and fell apart. It's a shame cause I really liked the keychain and the funny looks I got for having it on my keyring...mainly cause no-one really understood it unless they watched the show it came from of course.
4,Awesome,"Great item for any Ghost in The Shell fan, bought it expecting it is somewhat small so it won't make my keychain bulky. When it arrived I was surprised it was quite big, but still awesome to have. The rubber they used to make it also is quite sturdy I expect this to last a long time."
1,Animal lovers beware!!,"This is NOT a book about cute capers of animals. It is a collection of the horrible, cruel and inhumane treatment of our fellow creatures by human beings and the unfortunate consequences of their responses to our invasion of their lives.The only thing I could do with this book was burn it! Save your money and don't condone this type of writing by buying this book.(The review form would not allow me to give less than 1 star. I would like to have given it minus stars!)"
5,For the cajun in all of us.,The wife is from New Orleans. We wanted some cajun music and this fit the mood. It is good old Louisiana stuff.
2,"interesting subject, terrible writing","I had to read this book for a course, which was a good thing because I would never have made it through otherwise. I am interested in the subject, and you do learn more about what the world is like for a learning-disabled individual. It is amazing that this guy could write a book at all, even with a lot of help! Unfortunately, he doesn't appear to have had access to any kind of editorial services, so reading it is like reading a 200-page freshman essay: painful. This is a pity, since this book could have been a fascinating read, and even a sort of reference work."
1,Poor quality - broken after 1 fall off the table.,"My son was extremely excited to get this toy. He saw one at a relative's house a couple months ago, and he couldn't stop saying ""Ninja Wheelie Time"". On Christmas morning, we even heard him on the monitor saying it before we even got out of bed. To his surprise, Santa had gotten him one. The orange one. Just what he wanted. But after only about an hour of playing (and he's not really rough on his toys) he decided to push the button while it was on the kitchen table. It rolled off and to its death. From that point on, none of the buttons work. It's still, lifeless, and quiet. Physically, it is pretty sturdy. Even the ""training wheels"" that keep it standing appear to be made of metal. But the thing that makes it SO COOL to kids, the electronics, the wheelie, the noise of the engine, are cheap. And they broke much too soon."
5,Rocking lullabies,This CD is awesome! It is a lot easier to listen to these CDs over and over again. Baby loves repetition but I don't. It's also kind of funny to listen to if you know the words to some of the songs they turn into lullabies. We highly recommend this series of CDs from Metallica to Nirvana to Greenday. Enjoy!
4,Beautiful re-imagination,"As a MetallicA fan I was excited to be buying my young daughters these calming renditions of MetallicA songs. They have been impressively re-imagined and composed and it's amazing such frenetic, loud music can be transposed in such a way.My only wish was that some of the songs were a bit longer, or that instead of favouring the 'hit songs' they had re-worked some of MetallicA's more musical numbers or perhaps done some medleys. But that aside, it is still a fantastic CD that all the family listens to when we need to chill out!"
5,Great Product,Came in great condition. Fantastic seller. Package arrived much sooner than expected. Would be glad to order from them again!
3,"cool, but a little scary for a baby","I thought it was really cool and cleaver, but a little scary for a baby."
2,OK but there is better- MyCradleTunes,"Rockabye is great but I don't love all the songs on the album. Go to [...] You can custom build CDs and there are more options- country, rock, pop- everything for baby!!!!!!! You can even request songs you would like added to the site. Awesome!"
3,Enter Sandman?,"I've been a Metallica fan for 20 years and was beyond excited when I recieved this as a baby shower gift. What a great idea! I mean, who doesn't want their kid to throw up the horns instead of formula! What new mom doesn't want her kid's first word to be ""Lars"" instead of ""mommy."" Get 'em started early, that's my motto. However, upon listening to the cd, even I was creeped out! I'd rather my kid listen to the real ""Orion"" than this cd. Dark, gloomy, emo, destined to walk the halls of his high school wearing black eyeliner and black nail polish and a black trench coat. Not to mention skinny jeans. Not for us. We'll share time on the iPod by alternating ""How Much is that Doggy in the Window"" with ""One"", ""The Wheels on the Bus"" and ""Master of Puppets."" Throw in a Metallica onesie and you're set."
3,"A little ""dark""","While I love Metallica, the renditions in this cd were a little too ""spookey"" for my daughter (age 4) . After listening to it with her, I can agree. It kind of replicates some sounds that would be associated with scary scenes in some movies and cartoons. If you have a baby that can not obviously associate the two. I would recemmend it! But for this age group not so much. We played two songs before she shut it off herself."
2,Can't clasp it,"the necklace is pretty, however, the clasp wont open far enough to attach to the chain so I cant even wear it."
1,Super Disappointed! Arrived BROKEN,"Well, that will teach me to not check out merchandise before I wrap it up for Christmas. I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas, paid the one day shipping for $3.99. It came in the mail and I did not take it out of the plastic wrapping it was in when it arrived. I put it right in to the gift bag. My daughter opened it thie morning and the chain is broken, not even at the clasp. It is broke right in one of the chain links!!! Thanks for NOTHING."
4,excellent text on all positions with great pictures,I found this book to be very well written with a good attention to details that can aid in making the learning process smoother. The chapters are laid out well keeping an order to the important steps one must take to learn and build upon each skill. I was pleased with the chapter on metalurgy as it is very important to all types of welding procedures. I suggest this text to any welder in search of a basic starting point in this field. Well worth the money.
5,Awesome book!,"Great reference book for welders new and seasoned alike, a good referenceBook for getting back under the hood after taking some time off."
1,Not for 2006 ML350,"If you used Amazon's part finder for select this wiper blade for your 2006 ML350 -- run for the exits! It will fit on the rear wiper blade holder, but it is too long and will not work correctly. Sorry that I don't know the right part. After the problems with this order I just went to the dealer and paid through the nose. At least they know the right part."
5,Photos from Paradise...,These are marvelous pictures of a time that is barely imaginable --Tom Blake looks like god......his photos of he and Duke Kahanamoku and Tom's girlfriend are classics and priceless. Great slices-of-time surfing at Waikiki.....presented in a beautiful hardcover. Soon to be out of print....save in the limited edition - joe t. of surfbooks.com
4,Archive photos of a surfing legend,I got this book as a gift for my dad. He is a dedicated longboarder and he digs books like this. Its quite a slim book but the photos and layout are cool... it feels like your holding part of a museum archive in your hands. Its amazing how those guys surfed on huge wooden boards back in the day.
3,NOT MUCH FOR THE BUCKS,THERE ARE SOME RARE PHOTOS WHICH ARE COOL.SOME GOOD TEXT ALSO.JUST NOT ENOUGH FOR MY $.
4,Mike's sweetie,Most new parents don't think the first 12 months of parenthood is a laughing matter...till they read this collection of 101 cartoons by Lynn Johnston. There's something about sleepless nights and babbling days that seems a lot funnier in a cartoon book.
3,Hi Mom! Hi Dad!,"I love the book, but the details on this used copy were not very accurate. There were names stamped in the front and back and on the title page and the pages showed much more age (yellowing and spotted edges) that were not listed in the description."
5,Ronstan specs,"* Ronstan Snatch Block-All Purpose Roller Bearings.* This Ronstan block features tough and reliable solution for temporary leads and line deflection.* Features easily operated latch mechanism, soft resilient cheeks, removable aluminum sheave, stainless steel needle roller bearings, and 'cam lock' models feature easier opening and positive closure.* Materials: 316 stainless steel frame and load strap, anodized aluminum sheave, 316 stainless steel needle roller bearings, soft PVC cheeks, and investment cast stainless steel snap shackle.* Sheave diameter.:1 3/4"" (45mm).* Max. rope: 5/8"" (16mm)deforms at (Ib): 5000."
4,"Great, underrated movie",Beautiful cinematography and a heartfelt story. An underrated gem that's absolutely gorgeous on Blu Ray. Certainly one of Coppola's better modern works.
4,Drama & them some ... Don't blink !!!,"Intense drama about brothers?Yeah, you thought so.Younger brother seeks out older brother.Older brother has issues.You find out why as the story unfolds.cinematically rewardingvery creative, meaning the plays / moviesThe characters are very likeable except for the main actor.... very short 2 hrs ..."
2,Every Font Seems Divine,"Gallo is hilarious when he gets mad!! This reminded me of Buffalo '66 at times. The story is a little too ambitious, but the cinematography, acting, and score put me in a daze from beginning to end. Right up to the end credits -every font seems divine."
2,Long movie short rental time,I was enjoying this movie but since it is pretty long I couldn't watch it all at once. The 24 hour rental is impractical. I probably won't rent from amazon again.
3,NOT 16 gauge or Flat,"This wire is usable ... but NOT flat ... actually quite bulky. It is also very fine stranded wire and NOT 16 gauge. That is likely why it is so cheap. I had some flexible, clear, 18/2 AR wire which was really very good for ""thin wire"". In this case you get what you get pay for ... cheap wire."
3,Speaker Wire,"This is the second time that I have purchased this same item from Amazon.com. With each purchase, the eight banana pins was not included with the wire as shown in the picture and as outlined in the item description. Amazon is falsely advertising this item. As a result of the banana pins not being included as shown, it has cost me an additional expense to complete my project."
4,Speaker wire fine - missing connectors,"As noted by another customer I received the speaker cable which was just fine, but the connector pins were missing. I emailed Amazon and they sent a replacement order automatically. Same issue with the second order - wire only, no connector pins. I'm happy with the wire by itself - just be aware you'll need to order your own connector pins if you want them."
1,Worst purchase,"the speaker wire come very fast. However it doesn't come with the connector. I called the Amazon support, they send me another set of speaker wire, it still didn't come with the connector. You have not other choice either return the entire order or take the order without connector."
3,slow reading but nevertheless a great historical record,The Pastons and their England by H.S. Bennett is a interesting story about the lives of a 15th century family and their struggle and truimphs along the way. This book is a great reference through the letters written by various family matters for historical matters. If you are a history major in college or just a history fanatic this book is one you can't let slip through your hands.
2,Inaccurate!!,"I purchased this thermostat back when I bought my house. I replaced an old Honeywell round mercury switch thermostat. This one is difficult to see in the dark, so the light comes in handy. I have found it to be very inaccurate. The GasPack unit actually goes into overheat protect and shut off because this will run and run and run. Same thing in the summer with cooling, only it doesnt overheat.If I set it for 70 and the house is at 65 it will overheat when it reaches 70. In the summer it will show 80 for room temp and 80 for set point yet run for over 5 minutes and never change. Then it finally shuts off but turns it back on in 2 minutes. I didnt have these issues with the mercury switch thermostat"
4,Good Value,"This thermostat seems to be a functional unit, not a bad deal for the money. My order shipped from several facilities, taking a couple of extra days to get them all, but all in all a smooth transaction."
3,No indicator for Aux (EmHeat) on display.,I have a heat pump system with EmHeat (or called Aux) and replaced my manual thermostat with this one but noticed that this unit does not have any indicator to show if your EmHeat is running. Having an indicator is very important to me to make sure system is running and how long and how much my unit is consuming power.
1,Garbage,"This by far the biggest piece of garbage I have bought. The programmability part of the thermostat is nice, but the ability to gauge temperature is down right horrible. I have it set to 80 during the day when I'm at work. I've come home during the middle of the day to find it be low 70s in the house while the thermostat reads 80ish. At nights it is set to be around 72 while on a thermometer it will be anywhere from 65 up to 78. It is supposed to adapt to know how long to run the A/C to reach the desired temperature based on time of day. It has only adapted to becoming a nightmare. I'll never buy one of these units again."
2,very expensive,"the cover says it handles outside power source, but service hotline was not helpful.the instruction is the same thickness as the thermostate"
2,"easy to install, but intuitive program is a nightmare","It is very easy to install. But we have a new house and it replaced a basic digital thermostat. The BIG annoying factor is the intuitive program that calculates how long it takes to heat or cool, so therefore it has it to the desired temp for the designated time. BUT for me, I wanted to save money so I want it off during the day and off at night. But I find that it is on for HOURS before it is supposed to turn on. I wished it was simpler and would turn on when I want it and be off when I want it. It's not saving me a dime in my utilities. Don't get it unless you don't care about your money.It is very easy to setup, and is VERY easy to use."
5,Stunning!!!,this is the most beautiful CD i've heard in a long timeand yal has the most stunning voice
4,Obsession,Great read. How many others have tried this and simply disappeared because of the many dangers along the way?
2,Inferior To Siberian Dawn,"Tayler's story wasn't bad, it's just that the underdeveloped Congo with its many hardships made an inferior setting compared to post-Soviet Siberia. I didn't find this recounting of his journey nearly as interesting as I did the other book by him I read earlier in the year. Tayler has guts to make these one-man trips into the wildest places on earth, and I expect someday we'll just...stop hearing from him."
3,"Good coverage, puzzling length.","I just recently tried regular Tampax tampons (as in not ""Pearl"") for the first time and I can't get over how long these guys are. You obviously don't feel the product as you're wearing it (good grief!), but you definitely notice the amazing length when pulling one out. It almost reminds me of the scene in ""Mary Poppins"" when she pulls the impossibly tall plant out of her bag."
1,Stop. Not what's advertised,"This product is listed as six drill bits. It is only one. Do not buy this product. Again, do not buy this product, it is not what is listed."
5,Excellent!,"This is a superior product for drilling mild steel and other uses.Have not tried on harder materials. As a retired IA Teacher, I've been through many 3/16"" drill bits.I find them perfect for drilling pass through holes for sheet-rock type screws."
5,Magick in Self-Respect/Honor/Love,"FireFox shines the light and opens the door on things many of us may need to look at more closely. Her laid-back, casual, writing style is personal and unpretentious. In a very readable and usable format, she offers an approach to ritual that is remarkably personal and effective. She shares with us some ways to love/learn/listen/understand our bodies more deeply and grow into the fullness of which we are capable. She invites us to explore our heart and to become our best lovers - She shows us how this powerful Magick is always available and in us always - Best of all she shares with us how to use this Magick once harnessed.I highly recommend this book. I will however caution that readers may require some measure of comfort with their own sexuality or at least a willingness to be open-minded about exploring this aspect about their lives."
3,Sexy Witch,"""Sexy Witch"" is written for women who are uncomfortable with sex, sexuality and their bodies. If you have body-image and/or self-esteem issues and want to increase your comfort level with yourself, this book may be beneficial to you. I gave this 3 stars because I did not care for this book, but I can see where it would be helpful to a sexually repressed woman with a negative attitude regarding sex and sexuality. It contains some course language, but it is not used in a negative context. The author is trying to make the reader comfortable with her feminity by using the common, crude names given to the female anatomy by society-at-large. This book is not geared towards women who are comfortable in their own skin. If you are comfortable being a confident, sexy woman and are looking for ways to enhance those qualities, this book will not be beneficial for your situation and maybe, you should consider another selection."
1,A Sad Disappointment,In reading this book I had high hopes that it would be about empowering women or at the very least celebrating the sexual side of womanhood. I found it a rather juvenile boring read and the course language in poor taste.
1,"Wow, this is SO bad...","If you want a book about how to gaze at your crotch with a mirror, or advice to smell and taste your body secretions, (I KID YOU NOT!!!) this book is for you. If you want a serious book about Witchcraft, go somewhere else. This book is going in the trash bin."
3,Not impressed with the book itself,"The seller was great, but the book wasn't what I expected. A lot of it is to prerecord, then lay down and meditate on. I'm sure I'll use it at some point"
4,It sure ain't your average ghost story/suspense novel,"I truly enjoyed this book. It was suspenseful thru and thru (although a little slow at times). The story was like a spider's web in that it brought together all these little pieces to make a great big picture.My favorite character was little Dulcie, the daughter of the deceased Kristin. She was a great character full of life, vitality, and wisdom.I also loved that the author didn't force Julia and Paine's mutual attraction down our throat. The book was surprisingly free of the usual romantic cliches (they really annoy me!) that you find in other suspense books.I am sure that anyone who reads it will enjoy it!"
5,In the Blink of an eye...,"One night I was at a book store and came across the shelf with wendy Corsi Staub's books on it. I have'nt read a good book since my son was born last year, so I thought I would give this Author a try. I thumbed through all the books the store had of Wendy's and found "" In the blink of an eye"". I was hooked from the very first page. I love any book that starts off with twists and turns! It was so hard to have to put this book down lol, I took it every where! I was sad to finish it last night :(, If you run across this review, I really think you should give this book and Author a try. I am now purchasing ""All the way home"" and ""The last to know"".I DO wish there was a little more written romance between Julia ( who when I pictured her, Ashley Judd came to mind)and Paine. Great job Wendy!!! :)"
2,In the Blink of an Eye by Wendy Staub,"This was my first book by Wendy Staub and I was disappointed. The story line is great and when I ordered it I couldn't wait to read it; however, the author's writing style totally turned me off. I prefer ""first person"" writing style. I'm not sure if this is an example of ""third person"" writing, but whatever it is I don't like it. I don't know if this is her style in all her books---I hope not."
3,Took too long to get to a good ending,"Too much unnecessary detail in these 420+ pages. This book could have carried the plot, characters, setting, and denouement in 250 pages or less.I did enjoy the ending, but it was mighty cumbersome getting there.She has obviously done her research into the Lily Dale community, but I wonder how the spiritualists of Lily Dale feel about one of the mediums in this story being a fraud?"
5,a different look only 15 minutes away,"Reading this book was a pleasure for me since Wendy Corsi Staub is from the same city as I am and that I too have visited Lily Dale also. This book just draws you right in, while explaining Lily Dale and any part of Western New York to a T. I recommend this for anyone interested in spiritualism."
4,I enjoyed It!,"I have read this author in the past, and I like her style. Her plots are always interesting, if not a little far-fetched. This was one of her better books because she developed the characters so well. Even the dead girl, Kristin, is portrayed with familiarity and distinctive character traits. I found the main character, Julia, to be a little pathetic. Here she's supposed to be the sensible one and she can't see that the guy she's dating is a creep? He was sort of a pointless addition to the cast, but I think he was included in the story to provide the reader with another suspect. Rupert was a very confusing character. He will walk on a bed of nails for his wife, who's dying of cancer, but he doesn't seem to care about his daughter, whom he so easily discarded from his life. I would think a man who loves his wife as much as he does would have an equal love for his own child. However, overall, I thought it was entertaining and fun to read."
5,Dang Good Book,"I love thrillers and I love paranormal thrillers even more. Joseph Nassise delivers a faced paced thriller filled with paranormal/supernatural suspense and drama. And to add to the appeal, he uses the Templar Knights to drive his tale. The Templar Knights, gave a mystical feel to the whole book, adding a depth that draws you into the twisted turn of events that lead to a satisfying finish.Cade, the main character, has to identify and locate a supernatural enemy know as the Adversary. An enemy he has already tangled with once before, which resulted in him having a few supernatural abilities himself. Cade leads a team of Templar Knights dedicated to protecting mankind from exactly this kind of danger.Excellent read, can't wait to start the second book, A Scream of Angels."
4,Pretty good read,"A nice mix of actual history and fantasy, engaging and easy to read. I'll be purchasing the next book in the series. :)"
5,A thrilling read,I love this story. It's fast paced and action packed. I love the whole 21st century update to the Templars role in the Church. I look forward to reading the other books in this series.
3,Pretty good,"I enjoyed ""Heretic"" - mainly for the supernatural ideas and concepts involved. There's definitely room for improvement in the area of organization and layout, but it was a decent page-turner (something I really value in a book)."
3,Bloody Beach Read,"I read the sample and thought this book would focus more on the organization. Instead, it's about Cade and his elite squad of hunters. But once I made the adjustment, the book isn't too bad. The plot is a bit cliche and it relies a lot of deus ex machina, but if all you are looking for is a mindless, bloody story, it works.I wish there had been more character development, though. There are hints of character in Cade and the others, but those hints are brushed aside in favor of ""more kill!"" Maybe this will be addressed in later books; maybe it won't.Overall, this is the kind of book you want to take on vacation."
4,"Engaging, Imaginative Thriller","I found the premise of a modern day, SWAT team Knights Templar interesting.The story picks up pace quickly and maintains the tension throughout. There were scenes in the book so well written I could see it in my head like a movie was playing.The book reads like a movie or video game.The writing gets a little sloppy towards the end, and I get the sense that the first half of the book was well edited but there wasn't as much focus towards the end.Overall a great, quick read with interesting characters and story."
4,Pretty good,I was pleasantly surprised with this book. Templar books can get overly complicated. This one did not. It is a quick read. My only complaint would be the glaring typos. Some you could forgive...others made no sense at all.
2,could not finish,"Trapped by the sample into buying. It is not a case of bad editing, just fizzles as a thriller. Nothing to keep you reading. No depth to characters. No hook in the story."
5,Great read with a side eerie.,"Really enjoyed ""The Heretic"" and look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy. Cade Williams is one of the most interesting characters I've encountered in a while.Enjoy, the book is definitely in your price range."
3,"Action, Adventure, and Armageddon","Always eager to explore the writing of a new author, I ""borrowed"" this e-book from the Kindle Library.The author seems to spend more time forcing himself to give detailed descriptions of the environs of his characters and descriptions of individuals than concentrating on the story being told.It is a good story, and he holds true to the storyline however there were moments that reading the book, the writing felt stilted and forced.Having read the first in this author's series for free through the Kindle library, I'm very likely to pay to read the next book in his series when I finished the other books I'm currently enjoying."
3,Lots of action but not much character development,"I thought the action was intense, but I have a difficult time accepting Jesus and the Templars as action heroes. Machine-gunning and other gory death scenes just don't jibe with my concept of spirituality and the war between good and evil. It's more like Sgt. Rock meets the Ghoulies.I was also disappointed in the lack of much of a feminine presence or influence in the book. The only female characters are both presumably dead."
3,"Do you like ""Buffy""","This book ended up not being my style (hence 3 stars) but if your into ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" you will like this book. It's well written, fast paced with lots of monsters to be disposed of in varied ways, the story line is interesting enough to be a good page turner."
5,A surprise!,"I got this book thinking it would be a switch from the mysteries I usually read. I love series, I enjoy getting to know characters and revisiting them to learn more. Not really thinking that I would be interested enough to want to read the next book, I am happy to say that I can not wait . Good plot, interesting characters, enough twists for even a mystery fan."
5,great plot,I picked up a free Kindle edition and couldn't put it down. Once I finished I immediately purchased the next in the series. If you are a fan of action/suspense/supernatural I think you'll enjoy it too.
2,Needs edited,"I'm nearly done with this (93%, according to my kindle). I wonder if it is worth finishing. The blurb sounded interesting, and initially the main character seemed interesting. I wanted to like this book, but as I read, the chance of that gradually diminished.I think the idea has potential, but the writing needs to be both cut and expanded, contradictory as that may sound.The thing is very wordy, partially due to the excessive use of progressive tense (i.e., sentences with endless strings of verbs ending in ""ing""). The prose is often overly melodramatic. There is tons of description that really isn't necessary to move the story along. This is the sort of stuff that could be cut, especially during the agonizingly slow (and lacking in tension) action sequences.The characters could be more fleshed out, and some of the plot elements reworked to make them less cliche."
3,"Not bad, but not for me.","I really wanted to love this book and I feel bad giving it a mediocre review. I'm not sorry I read it because I read quite fast and read scores of books, but I would probably only recommend it to someone that I know would specifically like the subject matter and enjoy the style of the book. That said there are things I liked about the book, I liked the way the necromancers and their abilities work, and some of the creativity and imagination put into the story. Overall not a bad book by any means but it was just not really for me.(I edited my review because I thought it was kind of harsh and vague. I must have been in a bad mood or tired or something)."
4,Exciting and Fun,This is my first Joseph Nassise novel and it won't be the last. I just bought his first novel based on the strength of this one. High action and a really great concept/idea. Hope this is the start of a series. This is a guy I will follow.
4,The Ford that Beat Ferrari: A Racing History of the GT40,"This is a good book, but not a great book. I own several other books by the author, John Allen, on similar subjects and there is a definite bias towards a british view of the subject. I have read about every book available about the mid-sixties era of racing, especially the Ford contribuiton. Although I feel very knowledgeable on the subject, this book still filled in many empty areas I have on the subject and did it in a fairly enjoyable fashion. Having already stated I own many books on this subject I still am happy that I purchased this one. It is one of the better books on this subject. Enjoy"
4,My Favorite Crossword Puzzle Dictionary!,"Although I'm sad to see the New American Dictionary has not been revised since 1986, I am buying a new copy since I found this to be absolutely the best crossword puzzle dictionary. The cat ate the front and back pages off of my old one (my fault for leaving the catnip package to close to it!), so I guess I'll have to part with it and get a new one. It's categories section is the best and includes categories such as: The Bible, famous names, foreign words, geography, mythology, presidential information and more. It's a must to help find the answers for those last empty boxes!"
5,Crossword Dictionary,"This is my second copy of this - I use it daily doing puzzles, so it became quiteworn out. I couldn't do without it!Barbara"
3,In the USA rice is just rice.,"Want to taste rice with a unique flavor? Try Vietnamese rice. They use a very unique fertilizer. Comes from animals that eat many things. Vietnamese noodles are made from ground up Vietnamese rice. For breakfast have noodle soup, shrimp, ice coffee and a dead ripe mango."
2,Poor Quality,"For this price I was expecting something that would last a long time. I bought two and as others have noted, both eventually broke within about a year. The pepper mill stopped grinding (rotated freely without catching on peppercorns) and the coarseness adjuster snapped off on the salt mill when I tried to adjust it. They are also unduly heavy."
3,good grinder but doesn't last,"We have owned two of these grinders. We really enjoyed using them (although company always needed a lesson in how to use it properly). They both ground the pepper easily and to our taste. It wasn't too big, but big enough that we weren't always refilling it. However, both grinders lasted 3 years, and then the plastic internal parts broke. We won't buy it again. Looking for a grinder that has all metal parts."
2,Broken in less than 3 years,I bought this in October 2008. I thought a pepper grinder would last indefinitely. Not so when plastic is used for parts that must take frequent stress. A chuck of plastic broke off the grinding mechanism. I wonder if it got ground up into my food. Back to the old mortar and pestle.
2,Ditto on the Didn't Last,"We are pretty heavy-duty cookers but this product only lasted for about a year before the internal mechanism cracked. I should note that we purchased two at the same time, one for white pepper and one for black, and they both broken within a week of each other."
2,Prefer pepper to come out the bottom.,"I have had the same peppermill for over 35 years. I bought this type without noticing that you have to take off the cap, turn the peppermill upside down and then put the cap back on when you're finished. What's with that???? Well, I just want to grab the peppermill, give it a few twists and put it down. I don't like the style of this in the least and it is going to be returned. I don't mind a bit of pepper-dust on the counter now and then. Grab and twist; that's what I want!"
3,Didn't last,"We enjoyed the peppermill for about a year, but then the grinder mechanism stripped out; too bad we didn't look at the Amazon reviews before we bought ours!Regarding the top-output design, it is neat (no pepper on your counter or in your cabinets), but the lid is one more thing to juggle when you're cooking. Not a big hassle, but something to consider.Now off to search for something better.UPDATE: ---------------------------------------------See my customer image for a detailed view of the failure.UPDATE 2: -------------------------------------------I emailed the company with my picture of the stripped out part and they sent out a new one, with nice multi-color peppercorns and no questions asked!"
4,Great for grinding larger amounts,"The one thing I loved about this product, which was not mentioned by other reviewers, was the ability to grind quite a bit of pepper at one time. If you have ever come across a recipe that called for a teaspoon or a tablespoon or more of freshly ground pepper, you know that this can take a while (and probably cause your hand to cramp) with most other pepper grinders. This one can easily create a tablespoon of ground pepper with just a couple of turns.Like some of the other reviewers, the grinding mechanism on mine also quit working after about 2 years. I am sending it in for a new one. But, if they don't repair it, I will probably buy another one just like it, because I liked it better than any other one I've owned.Update: I sent the pepper mill in, and in less than two weeks, received a brand new one from the manufacturer."
1,Plastic Part Breaks Time and Time Again,"I have owned three of this model. One by one, they have all bit the dust. The internal grinder component is made of plastic and gives out in 8 or so months of use."
2,Olde Thompson peppermills don't hold up.,"Our second Olde Thompson Bavaria peppermill just failed. The plastic piece inside broke and the head just spins free (same as the first one that failed.) If you buy one of these, plan on it lasting a year."
5,No messy counters!,This peppermill is sleek and at 5 1/2 inches does not take up too much room in a cabinet or on the counter. I love the fact that the pepper is ground in the top of the mill and poured out over the food so that when you place it back on the counter you don't get messy pepper grounds everywhere.
2,Good until it breaks,"Like other reviewers, mine broke. This happened after a few years of use but the use was modest. The internal grinding ring stated spinning so you could twist it beautifully in synq with grinder which of coarse means it no longer grinds. You cannot take it apart with breaking a plastic retaining ring so efforts to glue the grinding ring is not practical. The grinder looks good, worked good until this malfunction but the way it is made, I would call it a temporary grinder. I would try another."
2,Not durable,"Owned this pepper mill for 5 months before it broke. When it worked, it was very nice. Ground lots of pepper with little effort, and I liked the lid thing that kept grounds from getting everywhere.However, the grinding mechanism would loosen itself slightly with each grind, so your pepper became progressively more coarse if you forget to readjust. The mouth to refill the pepper container is also quite narrow, so refilling takes longer than it needs to (though is not very hard).Then one day, after 5 months of moderate use, the pepper mill broke mid-grind as I was making breakfast. I gave it a couple rotations to see what was going on, and the grinding element and a load of pepper corns came streaming into my eggs. The apparatus that holds the grinding element in place inside the grinder is made of plastic, and it cracked in half.Not happy with the durability of this product. Gets more than one star only due to good grinds while it worked."
2,Interesting but extremely dated information.,"Much of the information would be applicable back in the late 1980s, and even early 1990s, but after the recent events of September 11 and increased scrutiny of people who would use the information would be setting themselves up for trouble.In addition, there are a number of companies mentioned in the book, and no address, phone numbers, or contact information are provided. It might be the author's intent that whoever really wants to know the needed information would know how to get it, but the casual interest person would be left in the dark.There are more current books out there, don't waste your money on this one. Now, if Mr. French and Lapin want to update this one... THEN, it would be well worth the money."
3,A very informative book 15yrs before but now................,"That's really a informative and powerful manual of espionage 15 yrs before. If you had taken this book 15 years before, it would be sure that you would have became a successful, well equiped spy. But now most of the companies which it mentioned in order to get the materials to build, make, manufacture the things that this book taught was already closed and lot of techniques this book taught is already out dated.If you are doing some research or want to know more about the espionage techniques of the past, this book is for you. But if you want to become a spy, what this book can do for you is --for fun."
3,"Muted Performance, Poor Sound Engineering","I do not recommend this performance. It doesn't engage me. Either Zacharias' vision for the piece doesn't work or more practice is needed to execute it well. Perhaps a little bit of both. At any rate, this performance lacks the emotional range that you will find with successful versions. On the engineering side, the recording has poor imaging, slightly restricted dynamic range for a SACD, and unusually restricted bass. I hope this ensemble gives the work another try as I bought this disk based on my love of their Mozart Piano Concerto # 21. Get that disk instead as it has a great performance supported by excellent sound engineering."
2,gulp,"these episodes are way out of order and don't make since,If you are an older gen1 fan and must get this series wait for the box set because at least the episodes will be in order.armada was a pitiful cartoon with so many mistakes it's pitiful,for example just about every episode has someone calling another character by the wrong name or they reuse the same animation over and over again,in fact some animation just has the mouth moving but nothing else moves,and those kids are annoying,you have a fat kid you complains all the time about how hungry he is and you have a mexican kid who is so stereotypical that it's not funny,alexis is the female and she tries to boss the autobots around like she knows everything,rad is the only normal kid but he's still in it way too much in fact...SPOILERS.............he saves the universe at the end of the series,I guess we didn't need the autobots after all...."
5,If you think .... you will like it,Molleen Matsumura is someone I met in the mid 1980's in Berkeley at a SHEB meeting and so I am biased in some ways.Having said that I am also a damn honest person and speak my mind. Voices for Evolution is a great book for those interested in knowing that others besides non-religious folks believe in the theory. And since Kansas (run dog run) has banned the teaching of evolution in their public schools (how many Nobel winners have they turned out in Kansas anyway?) I think this book has even more value.I would even suggest you buy a copy for your local library and then have a bookplate with your name as the donor put inside the front cover and thus let everyone in your village know at least one THINKER lives there.
4,Interesting Collection of Pro-Evolution Statements,"This book is an interesting collection of statements which favor evolution (and oppose so-called 'scientific' creationism) by various scientific, educational, and religious groups. This book contains ammunition that could be useful in debating creationists."
5,underrated... should be on the best of 2005 list,"This album is a miracle in itself, firstly because most bands would have given it up after so much adversity in a career and secondly, because they had the courage to write about all that pain in a way that never darkens the heart too much to make you turn it off rather you want to turn it up!!! Still ass-shaking and rocking harder than before, theSTART bring all the followers to their knees with this one and the courage to deviate from the popular keeps them ever so interesting... love them and love this album."
4,"""Life is Sweet"" and so is Initiation","This is actually a pretty good album, although it's not as strong as""Shakedown!"", or their ""Death Via Satellite"" EP. My favorite tracks on this album would be; Peacocks, A Thousand Years & Initiation."
1,Should have been better,"Bring back Human Waste Project, this is horrible.I did meet Aimee once and she was the nicest person, but I just can't dig this new stuff."
1,Light On Content!!,"I agree with the last reviewer. I purchased this book based on the positive reviews, but it is VERY light on content."
5,La novela que no olvidarás.,"La novela me fascinó! Una mujer desencantada de la vida tiene la más increíble de las aventuras al iniciar la búsqueda de su esposo secuestrado.Rosa Montero se las arregla espléndidamente para contar, sin cursilerías ni sentimentalismos, una divertidísima historia con inmenso contenido humano."
5,Excelente vision y filosofia de la vida.,"Es un libro como lo diria yo ""REFRESCANTE"" y sobre todo ameno. El que desee liberar tensiones y ver como esta escritora ve la vida ,desde su punto de vista lealo y no se arrepentira."
5,great foundational book,Quick read that does a great job summing up classical education/homeschooling. Even gives intro info about Latin and Logic study that I had never been exposed to.
2,Just nothing to say,"I can't say anything of this book, or almost anything, in the first 20 pages you know who is the bad guy and the book keeps rounding and rounding 400 more pages until they finally discover him, I really don't recommend reading this book."
4,The Salamander - Morris West,"Morris West's powerful novel is set in the tangle of Italian politics. Italy is a democracy that walks the tightrope between the extremists of the right and the left. Colonel Dante Matucci, of the Intelligence, fears the topple into totalitarian rule, as does the Salamander - the wealthy industrialist, Bruno Manzini.The Salamander is the legendary beast that lives in fire - the symbol of survival. And Matucci has to decide how much to pay for his survival in face of a threatened coup; his life, his soul, his love for Lili Anders, one-time spy and now his mistress.This is a novel of the intrigue, the violence, the passion that is Italy; the decisions are those that face us all at one time or another.Read the complete book before you judge it. It will surprise you by the end. ENJOY!"
4,It really works..,"I was skeptical about the first/second generation of these but my Apex seems to work fine. The only problems I could find were that under the 2 Hr resolution, the picture was extremely pixelated. However, what do you expect? A regular dual layer DVD rarely holds anything over 3 hrs, so why would you expect that a single layer one could hold that WITH GREAT QUALITY at 5 hrs?As with all Apex players, this plays everything you throw at it.The one lower budget aspect of this player seems to be that the recorder and player seem to be two completely different devices. When you switch from one to the other, it seems to take a while and 'boot' up that function as if it hadn't already been turned on for a while. Other than that, does what it says.The other quirk is that it has a really loud fan going while it's on, but I believe this is quite common among all of these."
3,disappointed,"I just received my second apex 9200 dvd recorder/player. The first one stopped at every chapter stop. (I must interject here that amazon.com was fantastic at taking care of my problem.) Just received the replacement. I thought I'd give it a real test and recorded a movie that was 2 1/2 hrs long. The quality was fantastic. The only drawback is that it still freezes at every chapter stop on my jvc equipment, yet it plays beautifully in the apex and in my HP computer DVD Player. Oh well, you cant have everything for $119."
1,Piss Poor Quality,"All I can say about APEX quality is: piss poor!I have now owned 3 DVd players/recorders, all of which have crapped out on me in less than a year. My first player started having problems in less than a year. The second two both broke on me in the same week. One is a combo machine, the other a recorder. When I called customer service about the recorder, which was purchased in December of 2004, all they could offer was $80 for labor and I pay shipping to California. What a joke! I can buy a new one for less than that. They make their products with either inferior parts, or inferior design schemes. After the 90 day full warranty is over, they will not last much longer. Avoid their products like the plague: I know I will.Bless,MJH"
1,Nightmare Customer Service,"When I got the machine, it wouldn't set the pm time so it wouldn't record. After calling Apex for two months, they finally told me they couldn't fix it & I had to return it. They said someone would call in 2 days with a RA#. After 2 weeks & many calls to them, they finally called with the RA#. I sent it back immediately & they told me, since it was being replaced it would be only 2 weeks before I got the new one. For the last 2 months, I've called each week to find out where the replacement is & they keep saying ""it'll be another 2 weeks before it's shipped""!! This is a replacement!! They can't seem to explain why it's taking 2 months to put a new machine in the mail. Finally, I asked for the money back instead of the machine & they said ""we don't do refunds - it's company policy"". I have now filed a complaint with the BBB. I strongly suggest you do NOT by anything from Apex. Their customer service is non-existant."
5,They don't make 'em like this anymore!,"True, the language is archaic (published 1937) and the vocabulary at times daunting (we've dumbed down quite a bit since 1937). I picked this book up at a used book store for $1; the subject interested me because I had just moved to Maine. It not only enhanced my appreciation for New England and American history, it kept me at the edge of my seat all the way through Book 1. What a pity this is not required reading in high school history classes across the nation! An interesting side note: I noticed that my copy, a second printing, was created only 6 months after the first printing - must have been quite the sensational best seller back in the day!"
4,Well worth the read...,"This is a book which I would consider it third in a group of books which I've read regarding the American Frontier and/or regarding the period from French and Indian War to the War of Independence. A book which is factual and and absolute must read is The Frontiersmen by Alan Eckert. However, in reading some works which are part or all fiction I would then say that the Leatherstocking Tales (i.e... Last of the Mohicans, Drums Along the Mohawk, etc...) by James Fenimore Cooper surpass this one to some extent but this one is still entertaining and is definitely worth the read."
1,Undoubtedly the worse math textbook I have ever seen,"This was the text book that was used in a course I took in Finite Math. Do not waste your time or money on this book. It does not go into any depth whatsoever, many of the thereoms shown were just pulled out of the authors hat without any proof of any kind. I honestly, had a hard time staying awake as I would read it, since it is so dull. It places far too much emphasis on phony applications and almost known on good solid theory. I only wish I could give this book a negative rating."
1,This textbook eats!,"I hated this stupid textbook, which I was required to have for a college math course. There are homework problems which the book does not give examples for. The examples it does give are extremely not helpful, especially if you are not a genius at math. My teacher explained things better, and he was foreign with an incomprehensible accent. Don't buy this crappy book if you can avoid it."
5,CREATIVE-MEDIA BOOKS,"Great transaction, Book was better than expected. Ship time was fast. So happy with the whole experience! Would do business with again."
4,Its a must for Rampa fans...,"Im not going to spoil your read, but if you're a Rampa fan - just buy it!"
1,The book disgraced authentic Tibetan Buddhism,"Cave of the Ancients by T.Lobsang.Rampa is a disgrace to the Tibetan buddhist tradition. The author claims the stories philosophy originated in Tibet. All the teachings such as crystal gazing, aura reading, and astral projection are unorthodox meathods and have no validity to Tibetan Buddhism which condems such practices as distractions to the true objective of enlightenment. Tibetan Buddhism recognises such practices as western occultism seeking eastern influences, much like Madame Blavatsky's Theosophical society."
2,Incomplete,"Either my back yard is foreign insect heaven or this book falls far short of being even a remotely complete guide to Florida insects. Since much of insect identification is done thru color identification, having pictures in black and white is a real hinderance. I know my insects, and even I had trouble placing the black and white picture to the real thing had I not known the name. They did get the habitat down, but not specific enough."
4,Crystal Theory Christmas Chillout,"This is a great CD for people who don't care for the traditional renditions of all those classic style/versions of Christmas Carols. It's almost irreverant in it's jazzy, bluesssssy, electronic style, but it is really enjoyable to listen to...especially if you CAN'T STAND those church coral, or operatic style of Christmas Carol.bert"
5,"So chill, it heats up your Christmas!","Bought this two CD and one fireplace DVD collection after hearing it at Costco in December 2008. I have lots of Christmas music, some traditional, some contemporary, but nothing else like this one. It is so great! You can pop-in the fireplace DVD and choose the music or crackling fire.The two CDs are remarkable, and playing them during a December dinner with guests will have them excited about picking up this set. My favourite is ""What Child Is This?""He is the reason for the season! Love, peace and joy."
1,7th CD a Disappointment,"I have 6 CDs by Butch Thompson, and they're all great. But this one - Christmas music - stride piano - It just doesn't work! By the time some tracks were half finished, the melody was still a mystery. Very disappointing!"
3,Not my cup O' Coffee!,"Good coffee for those who prefer a lighter cup of coffee, I happen to prefer a more robust cup."
5,What a wonder of a book!,"This is a book that I wish I had known years ago when I was a younger player. The way the different positions are displayed, including both the right and the false approaches, really gets one thinking about the game. I can read about the faults I clearly recognize that I make and then get advice on how to avoid them. This book is a must for any serious french carom player. I'm sure it will help me improve my position play."
3,Good for beginner,"This book is good for people who want to know the basics of billard game. The various techniques in the book are useful for beginners. If you are looking for more advanced techniques, you won't find them here."
3,THE REVIEW 2nd attempt,"This book looks good, but it is very over priced, so if you buy this book you are a stupid fool. That is all."
4,Low-tech fun,"This is a clown attached to a wire balance beam that ends in two red/ yellow balls. You balance the clown on his head, on his nose, on his feet--all on an attached pedestal. It's low tech, but it's fun. You have to figure out how to make the balance work, and then he turns in a circle with a slight push, or wobbles precariously. Simple pleasure."
5,Physics of star trek,"As a science lover , physics become interesting specialy in sci fy, and waht could be true know or in the near future"
4,unbelieveble,"I'm a trekkie for over 30 years, i've seen every episode, i know a lot about star trek but after reading this book, i'm astonished how much science there is in these shows.I'm happy for purchases this book, it makes me even more a TREKKIE. great book."
4,"In one word ...""Heisenberg Compensator""","Oh, wait ... that's two words. Must be over my head, like the book thought it would be. But I understood the thought processes of the author from start to end. (I learned something in science class after all.) Good explanation on how it should work. Too bad it won't work with todays thinking. Just wait - there will be someone to come along with a gadget like the 'Heisenberg Compensator' to make it all work the way SCI-FI saids it should work. Even if it shouldn't work because of the Laws Of Physics."
4,Not too shabby...,"As I looked through my local bookstore for an interesting read, I could not help but notice this interesting title in the Physics science section. Being a sporatic viewer of Star Trek myself, I picked it up for a closer look. As I read the first section of the book, I realized that it was more than blatant critique on scientific errors. Rather, it was an interesting view of future possibilities and also impossibilities in the field of science. In this book, Krauss explores the existence of things such as wormholes, black holes, and existence of other intelligent life in space. Krauss is also relentless in his discussion of Einstein and other renowned Physicists. He often writes about highly esoteric subject matter, but on the whole this book is well rounded and a relatively interesting read. However, keep in mind that one must have an interest in science, specifically fields such as quantum mechanics and relativity."
5,my brain hurt...,This books really surprised me.. I reread some parts several times to really grasp what he was saying because he delves into some pretty deep thinking and math based ideas. I highly recommend this to anyone who ever wondered how a transporter or warp drive could work and wanted a really good answer
5,Recommend this product,Product is as described and was delivered on time and in good condition. I would definitely use this service again.
5,Hey! it's by Lawrence Krauss... that's all ya gotta know!,"Anyone who is interested in science should buy and read this book. Like all of Krauss' writings, this will leave you inspired and uplifted. For Star Trek fans, it is also a fun read and an introduction to the possibilities which open up for minds unrestricted by outdated dogmas."
2,Author doesn't understand,"Although the author is great at stating on how impossilbe it is to do things like warp drive and transporters, according to relativity and quantum mechanics, the author knows nothing of the physics of star trek. His interpretation of how warp drive works for instance is not even close to how it really works. And all his assumptions on the technology is using modern day physics, which is portrayed by the author as the absolute truth to the universe. 500 years ago it was impossible to circumnavigate the earth, 50 it was the sound barrier, I suprise a scientist would say that anything(such as warp drive) is impossible no matter what improvement in physics. If you want a book on physics, get a brief history of time, if you want a book on star trek get the tech manual, just don't get this book for either."
2,We know it's impossible.,"Mr. Krauss does a great job of explaining why Star Trek technology is impossible in the real world. What I wanted to know was how it worked in the Star Trek world. What is subspace for example and why are they so many domains within it? If that's a question you have, this books doesn't have the answer."
1,The Physics of star trek,I was very very dissapointed with this book. It was advertised as a Hard back and when i received the book it was not it was a PLASTIC back. I have always been happy with my purchases from Amazon but i am sorry not this time.
1,Not unless you're a Trekie,"Ahh! I had to read this book for a class and it was awful. Unless you're a huge Star Trek fan, I don't recommend it!"
2,abridged version,"Although a well-made book, beware that this is an abridged version of the story. Good references in the book and notes. Helpful insights with questions at the end of each chapter."
3,La vraie édition doit tre mieux,Je crois que ce n'est pas une vraie version du livre. Il y a plusieurs erreurs de franais dedans et de typologie. Il y a des retours de ligne indues... La mise en page est ordinaire... Mais il est gratuit et le contenu est identique (j'espère) que la version éditée qui cote quelque chose.
4,None,"C'est une histoire tres interesant. Zola nous emmenent a la fin du XIXem cielcle et il nous montre la vie d'une vendeuse de nouveautes a Paris, la fin du ""vieux commerce"" et le debout du ""nouveau commerce"""
1,....,"this book is really dull... sorry, just had to say it. a complete bore, no poetic passion.. a tiring, sleepy pretentiousness may be a good way to describe kahn's book. Save yourself. Buy the work of a <good> poet - say, Thom Gunn for American homosexual poetics."
4,amazing and fresh,"kris t. kahn's first book of poems is beautifully written and sudden in its haunting grace. His poems probe the deepest part of a human psyche and bring back a masterpiece truly new and aware. His voice is solid and whole as every stanza brings the reader to a pivot of emotion, undeniable in its effect. Having read his book, I feel that it is one of the strongest I have encountered of the present generation and he will without a doubt make his presence known."
2,"Not bad, not especially good.","This book is full of heavy, self-important poetry lacking in depth but disguised with some eloquence. It is not bad if you keep in mind that the writer is an amateur."
1,Toshiba TVs are not reliable.,"I purchased a Toshiba HDTV and had it fail just after the 2 year warranty expired. Toshiba explained there was nothing they would do back up their product. No TV should fail after 2 years. I recommend selecting another brand, you can get the same performance and price, and end up with a more reliable product."
3,Jeez-Glad Dad didn't spend more than 500 for this....,"My dad bought one of these tv's. It's nice and all, but I don't think it's woth what most people pay for it. You can't even hook up a computer to it."
5,Love This Album,"One of my very favorite albums, I like this even better than ""Strikin' It Rich"" and ""Last Train to Hicksville"""
4,Swing On Back To Hicksville,"That ultra-cool hipster Dan Hicks is back with another swingin' collection of his unique brand of folk swing. Great music and a lyrical outlook like no other, Dan shows that he has not lost his touch. What this CD lacks is the magic of the original Hot Licks. Only Sid Page is back this time around. While this new edition is certainly talented, there is not the same chemistry. The female backup singers, in particular, are really underutilized. Maryanne Price is sorely missed. Still, the special guest like Bette Midler and Rickie Lee Jones turn in standout performances. Even though I may pine for the originals, this is definitely a disc worth owning."
2,Heat Exhaustion,"I am a Dan Hicks fan. I have every album (now on CD) that he put out back in the early 70s. My daughter's favorite song as a toddler was the ""Laughing Song,"" and I still catch her listening to it as a 17-year-old. So I was really excited when I read about this CD coming out. Placed my order in advance. Oh Dan, what happened to the snap in the band? Even the likes of Tom Waits and Elvis Costello can't pep up this tired testamnet to a well-followed and much liked troubadour. It sounds flat. I've listened to it about a dozen times, hoping to hear something I had missed; a little snappy violin, some good background harmonizing, some catchy lyrics. It just ain't there. Well, it is, but it's nothing like it used to be. I hope this is just a warm-up for better things to come."
5,Good product in plain packaging,"This item arrives in plain plastic packaging unlike the items in the retail store, but it works just as well and at least a third cheaper. I would recommend."
4,yes,This is just as good as Cinematic Orchestra. I am a hard grader but this gets four stars which means - you are lucky someone told you to GET IT!
2,Way too basic,"I just got a sparkling new Excalibur dehydrator and purchased this book for innovative ideas on how to use it. The book contained little more than the instruction book that came with the machine. There are no illustrations, which would have been useful. Most of the recipes are not ones I would use. For example, the recipe given to use tomatoes is ""Lamb Stew.""I wish I had purchased a book with more text, more ideas, and some pictures, since I am totally new to dehydrating. Disappointing."
3,Your mileage may vary,"I was given ""The Dehydrator Cookbook (Nitty Gritty Cookbooks)"" as a gift with my dehydrator. I flipped through it once and it has been on a shelf since.Most of the book is regular recipes that use dehydrated versions of the basics (fruits and veges). It has a couple of pages about jerky and fruit leathers. If you are dehydrating to save the bumper crop from the garden, this may be what you want. However if you are dehydrating for backpacking/camping etc, these are definately are not trail-ready recipes.The book doesnt have more than a few pages about what to dehydrate, and how to do it. It does have a nice table about how long different foods should take to dry, but it turns out that the listed times are significantly longer than my dehydrator takes so it is of no use to me.I have found much more useful info at various 'net resources."
1,"Simply, a lousy record","I recently bought this record, but nowhere in the Amazon website advertising, was there a warning that this record was a live presentation and I feel I have been swindled by Amazon. The record is lousy and the voices do not appear to be the original cast members of The Four Tops. Therefore, a warning to you all. Do not get swindled by Amazon, thinking that you are buying a record with The Four Tops original hits. And from now on, I'll be very carefurl when buying another record from the Amazon website."
1,2 tops at best,"possibly this is the current incarnation of the 4 tops- one top is dead and Levi Stubbs ( original lead lead singer and 'voice') had a stroke in the late 90's, so he is not with the group- but they still forge on.........I don't own it- heard soundbytes- and will stay away"
5,The Next Step,"This book not only will help you begin to expand what you can do with Acid Pro 5.0, but will also provide a review of basic music theory and song creation. It is more detailed, and not as fun to read as ""Instant Acid"" but can actually serve as a reference as you continue to grow in your technical abilities. You can hear how I used the info by lisening to Griffman on acidplanet.com"
1,Does not hold up,"Really unhappy with this product. I use a food mill a lot around the house and this had some warts from the start. The mill did not feed food in well and required a lot of scraper use to keep food in the processing area. It is now broken after 3 months of use, after paying $100+ i expect a lot better durability"
1,Chinese Manufacture + German Overpricing,I think the title says it all... Who is kidding whom? Why pay an extra seventy or eighty dollars for an 'umlaut' in the seller's name?
5,The 'best' of Tony!!!,Following Tony from publication to publication this is yet by far his best work to date. I highly reccomend reading the foreward written beautifully and eloquently by one of the greatest art connoisseurs I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. Pick it up...you'll never put it down.
4,Great product but buy from someone other than Amazon.com,"I love this product and have always purchased it from my local PetSmart however it seems as though they have discontinued carrying the product so I did a search on sellers of the product and Amazon came up! I purchased three bottles of the product, in addition to some other items, and each time it shipped I would receive an email indicating the package had been damaged in transit. So I finally wised up and just cancelled the order and ended up having it shipped from someplace else. I'm not sure if Amazon is the problem or if it's UPS but regardless, the product is great however don't buy it from Amazon."
1,Same Experience as Other Reviewer,"I also received a soaked box with about 25% of this product left in the bottle. I was able to use it enough to tell it is a good product, but I recommend you buy something at your local retailer where it doesn't have to be shipped."
1,Don't buy liquids from Amazon,"I ordered this product but was unable to use it. 9/10ths of the product had leaked out and soaked everything in the package. It was wrapped in plastic, but the plastic was very thin. The bottle was not closed securely and made a horrific mess. I don't know if it works 'cause I was unable to use it."
5,Good product. Great Company.,"The grinder is attractive, works well, and uses a glass jar.We bought this salt mill when looking for an all-glass variety, of which there are not too many choices. Unfortunatly it was dropped on our tile floor just a week or so after we got it. I found the company doesn't sell the jar individually, but they were super great about solving my issue, and mailed me a replacement jar right away at no charge - not even for shipping!!!So the company says, ""we can't sell you a replacement, but we will mail you one for free""... or words to that effect. I felt it was pretty great of them to handle it this way. I do wish they'd sell replacement jars in case it were to happen again, but what excellent service!Incidently, in a pinch we found that a typical $1.00 glass salt shaker from the market, has a jar that is threaded the same and would fit fine. wouldn't look so nice and doesn't hold much, but at least it would still be functional.I recommend this product."
2,poorly made,"Granted, I have used it every day. I don't think this should break in the first 6 months of use. The metal ring that fastens to the plastic base of the grinding part will come off as it is held by hot glue. Not the best, but sadly I can't find a replacement. No one makes glass grinders?"
2,Worked well but broke after only 8 months,"Our daughter and son-in-law had this pepper mill and as my husband puts pepper on most of his food, even his morning oats, I got one for him. It worked well but a few days ago the plastic parts inside broke into several pieces. We're disappointed with the quality."
2,Works great - except for the rust and breakage...,"My husband and I purchased a set of these (one salt and one pepper) shortly after we got married. We were very happy with them at the time. They were used several times a week and had to be refilled on a regular basis.Before our first anniversary, the salt mill simply broke. The metal parts rusted through. What a horrible design flaw! Metal is great - except when it rusts as it will when put near salt and humidity.The replacement mill that I bought was a Peugeot. After using it once, it was immediately apparent how wrong I was about THIS product. The Peugeot grinds the salt more fine and more evenly than this.Save your money. Buy quality."
4,Very readable,"Linux Bible 2008 edition is very readable. The page-countmay intimidate some, but the book is well organized andseems to provide an appropriate amount of detail. The CDand DvD work very well for trying out various flavors ofLinux. I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to exploreimplementing Linux onto their computer system.Linux Bible, 2008 Edition: Boot up to Ubuntu, Fedora, KNOPPIX, Debian, openSUSE, and 11 Other Distributions"
3,Out of sequence,I've been reading and enjoying all of Jan Karon's Mitford books in sequence and this one was out of sequence (as listed by the author) with events and offered the least content of all in this series.
2,Disappointment,"Still well written but this is really only a chapter that has been lengthen with wide margins, larger type, whole pages for chapter titles, and generally more white space than necessary into a novella. A BIG disappointment! I won't buy the next one sight unseen."
1,I've been ripped off!,"I can't believe it. I loved the Mitford series. What is this book? It's as though Jan needed some money, took something we had already read, slightly expanded on it and charged us full price. I'm feeling like a fool for buying it. If you've got an hour or two and are really bored, borrow it from the library."
3,Phillippians 4:13 for Pete's Sake!,"I too was disappointed in the length and lack of detail in the latest Mitford novel. I had read about it's forthcoming publication so I knew it was about the wedding of Father Tim and Cynthia, so going back in time a bit didn't take me by surprise. What did surprise me was the disappointment I felt when I saw the the lack of depth of detail in this book compared to the other books in the series. It's completely different in format from them, shorter text, larger type, wider margins. While I enjoyed the story contained in this book, I wish it had been treated with the care and consideration of the first books. I feel the author has let her loyal and enthusiastic readers down. I'll be careful to look at the next one before buying (this time I had pre-ordered the book)."
1,Disappointing,"I had eagerly anticipated the arrival of this book, having been totally captivated by the characters of the previous five books in the series. However, I was bitterly disappointed to find that the book did not continue the series, but rather went into full detail of the proposal, wedding and honeymoon of Father Tim and Cynthia. I do hope that the author will eventually get back to the story and I do not anticipate buying the two books coming out this fall(""Father Tim's Favorite Quotes"" and ""The Mitford Snowmen: A Christmas Story"" unless one of them actually continues the story of these most beloved characters. I do, however, highly recommend the first five books in the Mitford series."
2,Save your money - wait for paperback,"I'm a huge fan of the Mitford series, and I have given copies of the first 5 books to several friends who now share my love of this wonderful series, but I was terribly disappointed by the brevity of this book. It's much too short to justify paying hardback book price - it's advertised at 208 pages, but if you discount the very wide margins, the double spacing of the text, and all the blank pages, one would end up with about 50 pages. I preordered the book but I should have waited to read the reviews on Amazon first!"
1,What a Let Down,"Having devoured all of the ""Mitford Series"" books, I felt cheated while reading this one. It comes across as just being pulled together with bits and pieces from the previous novels. After waiting with great anticipation for this book's release, I was met with great disapointment."
1,A Common Life,"I was VERY disappointed. Maybe I'm just not following the author's intentions,but I was so waiting for the 6th book in the SERIES. This 6th book is not in sequence as I see it. I have already been through the emotional ups and downs of Tim meeting Cynthia -- the proposal--the wedding -- Miss Sadie dieing -- etc. I'm ready for a continuation -- Did Tim go back to Mitford? What happened to Morris Lamb? Is Dooley going to be reunited with any more siblings? I love Jan Karon's style of writingand the content of her books but ...."
3,I think she did it for the money,"Compared to all the other Mitford books, this one is like a bad movie of the week, or an old rerun of Love Boat. She could have easily added this to the next in the series, rather than devote a whole book to the wedding. And it isn't all that eventful a wedding, anyway."
3,A disappointment,I'd been eagerly awaiting the release of this book for months and was surprised to find it such a let-down. It seems as if the whole book is made up of left over chapters from the other books. I only hope the next book in the series is better.
1,B-O-R-R-R-I-N-G,"This volume is painfully boring. The reader (not the author)stinks.Way too religious. Un-interesting. As good as the other volumes were this is so bad it may be the last ""episode"" I listen to (audio book).I actually had to fast-forward the tape just to get through it."
1,So-o-o disappointing!,"I loved every book Jan Karon wrote in the Mitford series. When I read each one, I felt I lived in Mitford with these friends. I shared each book with friends and family, all of whom loved them. The announcement of ""A Common Life"" delighted me and I ordered it immediately. What a mistake!!! If there were a rating lower than one star, I would have used it. This book is not up to the talents we, who love Fr. Tim, Cynthia, Barnabus, Dooley, and the entire population of Mitford, know Ms. Karon has. Please, Ms. Karon, your fans have been terribly disappointed..."
3,A Picture Postcard...,"A Common Life fills in the details of the wedding of Father Tim and Cynthia. While the book is short and in someways sparse, it was a lovely glimpse of the events and days both before and after the wedding. While there is no ""story"" other than the wedding, we are given glimpses of our favorite characters and memories they hold dear. We see a ..show through Dooley's tough outer exterior, Uncle Billy finds his best joke, the townspeople of Mitford turn out in droves for the wedding of their beloved Father Tim. Initially I was disappointed in the lack of a ""story"", but as I read I became wrapped up in the love story again. To be a witness to the marriage of Father Tim and Cynthia as they stood before God was a true gift from Jan Karon. I stopped wishing for more details and a longer story and was grateful for being a part of a snapshot in the continued tale of the town of Mitford."
1,Disappointment,"I feel that the entire content of this book would have made an extra chapter in the one to which it relates. There is not much that is new here. All of the new information, if extracted, would take up 25 pages (without the art work). There is so much border art, it is obviously intended to take up space & make the book look longer. Jan Karon has a very faithful following for the Mitford series. I am disappointed that Ms. Karon thinks so little of her readers, that she would trick them into buying this."
3,Good but not her best!,I was disappointed that this book was not longer! I wanted it to keep going. It does answer questions that aren't answered in the other books. Next book please!
2,Wait for the Paperback,"I was anticipating the arrival of book six...what a disappointment. First, take note that it does not pick up the story where we left of in the fifth book...it is confusing to stick this book in the middle of the series and make the reader go back in time. Could the font get any larger without being ""large print""...huge margins = Karon didn't have time to write a full novel, but she wanted the money from one. Writing was ok, but clearly not as good as the past books. Disappointing...wait for the paperback if you buy it at all."
5,What she promised--Just what we wanted!!,"This book was a little piece of magic in an otherwise crazy work week for me! Jan Karon promised she would write about Father Tim and Cynthia's wedding and told us it would be a novella. This is what her fans asked her to do!! As for the margins and the type and the cover and all that other stuff--this is a love story about a wedding and must be properly packaged, don't you think??? This would make a wonderful wedding gift--the stories of our favorite Mitford character falling in love!! What better gift to give than the stories of love from our favorite town??!!"
1,"From Extraordinary to ""Common""","A Common Life was just that - nothing extraordinary here. I was so eager to have this next book that I purchased it without doing my homework. All the reviewers who expressed disappointment were correct - this looks like Jan Karon sold out. She wrote a short, quick, easy story (the plot was already crafted in a previous novel), just to get the income. Though I had been eagerly awaiting the next in the series, I would certainly have waited longer for a quality book. If you are compelled to read it - at least wait for the paperback, this book is not worth it.What a shame!"
1,I'm really disappointed!,"I bought this book without opening it. I love all of the others and I was anxious for a little more Mitford. The margins are large, there are a lot a blank pages in this book -- and -- it is extremely ""wordy"". It appears that Jan Karon needed to turn in a paper for her ""middle school"" English class and it needed to have a certain number of words. She must have opened her thesaurus periodically to just write down descriptive word, after word, after word. This book was definately NOT up to the standard of the others. I would not buy it - check it out of the library or borrow it from a friend. It is NOT worth adding to your book library with the other Mitford books. Trouble is, now I'm not sure I want to buy her next book - I'll have to read the reviews first next time."
2,Karon disappoints this time.,"A Common Life was a big disappointment after loving the rest of the Mitford series. Seems like Karon threw together a new book to capitalize on recent success. A Common Life lacked the familiar details of the characters we had come to know and love. The first five books in the Mitford series were wonderfully detailed about the community of Mitford and its residents. A Common Life wasn't a horrible book just a quick and simple read. If you don't already know and love the Mitford characters, don't bother with A Common Life."
2,I feel cheated!,"I have loved the Mitford books and eagerly awaited the latest one. It arrived today and I've already read it!! I have the feeling that Jan Karon felt pressured to come out with another book but didn't want to spend the time to really develop a plot, so she simply rehashed what we've already read. The story of the proposal, the wedding plans and the wedding are sweet and it's nice to revisit the familiar characters, but I felt she churned out something with the least amount of effort possible just to get it done. I was ready to learn more about the lives of all the people we've come to know and love and what they're doing now, not going back and devoting a whole book (I say that with a wink) because this book is more like a short story. Frankly, I'm disappointed and I feel cheated."
1,A Common Life,"A Common Life : The Wedding Story (The Mitford Years) by Jan Karon 4-11-01 I was VERY disappointed. This 6th book is not in sequence as I was lead to believe it would be. I have read all the other five books. I have lived through each and every one of the SERIES.... I was excited to find a new book in the Mitford Years.... but then to glance through it and see it is a rerun of what has already happened. I for one did NOT purchase this book. I love Jan Karon's writing style, but am uncertain why she would allow this book to be released two years after Tim and Cynthia's wedding had been in publication. I am looking forward to the next release.... hopefully the continuation of the Mitford family .... did they return to Mitford from the beach? What about Dooley and his siblings? What new jokes does Uncle Billy have to share?"
2,Good Short Story,"This would have made a good short story or,better yet, the last chapter of book #2 or the first chapter of book #3. I had looked forward to the next Mitford book, but was disappointed. Her publishers must have made her publish a new book before she was ready. Her previous book finished with sort of a cliffhanger, and I had assumed the next book would pick up there. Hopefully, Ms. Karon will spend more time on her next book."
1,Jan Karon Rewrites From Previous Books,"Come on, Jan Karon - this is just the old books rewritten. I have loved the first books and read them front to back without breaks. This is nothing new!What's happening to Dooley? There are other adventures Father Tim and Cynthia can have, why the rewrite?I am truly sorry that I waited anxiously for this book and that I spent money on it. I hope if Ms. Karon decides to write another in the Mitford books, it will have heart, and spirit, and joy, and new material!"
1,A Common Life,I was very disappointed in this book. I hope Ms. Karon will stick to the story from now on. Her previous books have been so well written that her fans have high expectations.
3,Mind candy,"I listened to the audio version during a lonely 7-hour drive. I selected this particular tape because I had read the first book in the series and wanted something light and entertaining, something that wouldn't distract me from my driving but would ease the boredom of the highway. It was the perfect choice.This is a simple story, simply told. I think it would have bored me to tears to read it but Dana Ivey presents it with just the right amount of acting (changing the voice only slightly for each character, for example)to be entertaining."
3,Sweet and Uplifting,"I agree with most other reviewers. A Common Life is not one of Jan Karon's better wrks. Still, it is sweet and upllifting with a wholesome message, much like Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin and The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks."
3,Out of Order,"I have read the previous 5 Mitford books and dearly loved them. This 6th book disappointed me in that it was out of context. It was confusing at times reading about things that had already been resolved in a previous book...I would have liked it much better had she put this book in proper position, as right after Father Tim had proposed to Cynthia.."
2,Disappointed,"After reading all Jan Karon's previous books and loving them, and not wanting them to end, I was really disappointed with A Common Life. It just didn't have the energy her others have had. I can't recommend it like I could the others. However, I am looking forward to her next book. She is a good writer."
4,Short but sweet,For selfish reasons I was hoping for more detail. We tend to miss these folks after we have read the whole series and feel that they are part of our lives. I guess Ms. Karon had her reasons -- -- I think the best is yet to come from Jan Karon!!! At least I hope so.
1,Father Kavanaugh: A mush-puppy?,"After being thoroughly delighted with the Mitford series and it's refreshingly innocent view of American ""down home"" culture, I was thrilled to hear that another book had been added to the ""middle"" of the series. However, my disappointment was tremendous when I read the book. The characters are transformed from real, likeable people into insipid, romantic mushers. I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst enemies! I hope Karon's next efforts revert to her previous talent."
3,Missed the mark!,"While the previous 5 Mitford books were each a sumptious feast, The Wedding Story was more like an appetizer. Got far too over the line into just mushy emotions, not the fun and rich and inspirational story lines of previous series. This could have been better handled on fewer pages within the series time line. But I have no doubt I will buy the next Mitford book. Hurry, Jan and get it to us!"
3,wonderful story,"I have read 6 of the books of the ""Mitford Series"" they are all very good. I laugh, I cry, but can any one tell me what has happened to ""Dooley""?"
1,Disappointment,"I was so excited to get this book and settle in with the characters from Mitford. How disappointing this book was. Dooley was back to 12 years of age! This book lacked the usual warmth that I enjoyed in all the other books. It was hard to read about Miss Sadie, knowing that she had died! Don't purchase this one!"
1,What's missing in this book?,"Like millions of others, I have read all the Mitford books (twice actually) and so when I first learned that the next one would be published in April, I pre-ordered it. I thought the cover was beautiful, but there was something missing...the plot. There isn't any story here. After reading it I didn't feel as if I knew the characters or the town any better. There were people we know and love missing from book..surely they would have been at the wedding. The next time we meet, Ill be expecting a lot of news and stories from Mitford!"
2,A MONEY MAKER????,"I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS BOOK CONTAINED SO LITTLE SUBSTANCE. WHERE IS THE NEXT MAJOR STORY I EXPECTED, A NEW CHAPTER IN FATHER TIM'S LIFE?"
2,A Common Life,"I was very disappointed once I received this book. I have so loved the Mitford series, this new book read too quickly with no substance, even though the Wedding was left out of earlier books, I anticipated this to be about Dooley and Lacey and their wedding."
2,WHAT'S GOING ON WITH JAN KARON,"I love the Mitford series. I recommend them to everyone. I, like most people, were left out when there was very little mentioned of the wedding in her last book. Unfornateley, this book left me very dissapointed. She really should have included the wedding in the last book. There was no plot. It only gave daily descriptions of what the characters were doing. There was no story line, or a plot. I kept feeling like Jan Karon, just hurry up and get to the wedding. Everything else was filler. I am so glad that I got this at the library and didn't waste my money on it. I will still look forward to her other books though."
2,Definitely not up to Jan Karon's usual standards,"I read all five of her first books and absolutely loved them. I was so excited to see another come out that I ignored the reviews and ordered the book immediately. Having just finished the book, I walked away wanting. This latest look into the life of Father Tim didn't have nearly the character that the first five books had. The citizens of Mitford were barely visable and I really don't understand why Ms. Karon chose to write the next volume smack in the middle of two previous books. I didn't miss the wedding when I was reading the other five. I would have much more enjoyed to know what Father Tim and his followers are up to now. It seems like Ms. Karon didn't put much thought into this book. She just pumped it out to keep her readers happy. This certainly won't stop me from buying the next book. I just hope that Ms. Karon gets back on track."
1,Disappointing,I read this book in about an hour and a half. The story added little to developing the wonderful characters I've come to love through the other books. The book seemed to be just a quickie fill in.
1,A Common Life: The Wedding Story,"I feel as though I have been cheated by the author. The Mitford Series was delightful and I was so looking forward to Jan Koran's new book, but I am highly disappointed that events are repeated. Dooley went off to college in the series. This book takes you back to where Dooley is a young boy living with Father Tim and wondering how he will feel about the marraige.Deja vu! Been there and done that."
3,"Well, it still IS Mitford!","I echo the review above, I am/was disappointed. This is NOT a 'continuation' in the series, it is a step back in memory. We all know how it all turns out. For the first few chapters, I kept having that 'de je vu' feeling. I kept turning back to the title page to make SURE it was published in 2001. Then I wondered WHY. Why after all this time, with Father Tim and his love being married and sent to the coast, am I reading about the wedding? I think the author goofed!However, as I said in my title, it IS Mitford and it's been a long time between doses. I DO wish book 6 had been a more current offering, however. The wedding story is nice and anything to do with Mitford is great, but I'm sorely disappointed that I'm not current with the gossip etc. in Mitford.How long do we have to wait for the REAL continuation to be published??????????"
2,Disappointed,Not up to the standard of the rest of the Mitford series. Lacks an exciting story line. Strictly for those readers who like wedding stories.
3,A Common Life: The Wedding Story by Jan Karon,"I enjoyed the book, as I have all of Jan Karon's other books; however, it was mainly a rehash of some of the other books."
4,A Common Life: The Wedding Story,"A good Read, but wish I had read it before some of the other books. Wish Amazon would list them in sequence."
2,A Common Life,"I fell in love with the Mitford Series and thought of Father Tim and the rest of the town as family. When this book came out, I raced to the book store anticipating another great book - I was so disappointed - I wish she had included this within the series - I didn't like going back (Miss Sadie had died already) I wish it had just continued from the island and included more of Dooley and what happened to him. I really hesitate to buy the one about snowmen - So sad in Indy!!!"
1,Not worth the wait,"After listening to and enjoying the audio tapes of the Mitford series on my way to work every morning, I was really disappointed in ""A Common Life"". Too much thinking from the characters and not enough story."
2,Disappointment,"This book was a major disappointment - I considered it ""filler"" and not much more than a rehash of the prior books. I really expected more after waiting so long for a new book. The book could have been written ""in order"" and would have made a great deal more sens."
2,A disappointment - not up to par...,"...okay, so Jan Karon said to expect a 'novella' rather than a full blown 'novel'. But, I found that this was a total letdown. The soul, richness and depth inherent in the other Mitford books is lacking in ""A Common Life"". Like many others, I preordered this book - not only for myself but for my mother and mother-in-law as well. I took my copy along on a trip to the UK, hoping that it would last me the trip - only took a few hours to read.Something else I missed - the wonderful illustrations that are so much a part of the earlier books. The bouquets throughout the book are nicely done, but I would have liked to see Cynthia, Fr. Tim, Dooley, Barnabas, etc. decked out in their wedding finery!Of course, most Mitford fans will purchase this book regardless - but I suggest you wait and get it at a much lower price. This book should have been list priced at less in my opinion. What a let down!"
3,We got what we asked for!,"Jan Karon is a fabulous writer, and has given all of us such a wonderful gift in creating Mitford. We all love Father Tim, Sadie, Louella, Dooley, Cynthia... But she chose to let us dream about their engagement and wedding, and we chose to believe that we could not! Karon was continually deluged by Mitford fans with requests for the wedding story, and now that she has written it, we have got to admit that even she could not do justice to the sweetness of the Timothy/Cynthia story! So we need to quit whining! A Common Life is a retrospective story about their wedding, it is a short read, and it is not a continuation of the Mitford series. But then, it was never promoted as one!"
1,"I'm so disappointed! Why did she bother, oh yes, $$$$","This is the laziest way to write a book I've ever heard of. Jan Karon has more integrity than this, please restore my faith in a great author. Write a ""BOOK"" not an epilogue."
1,Boring and sappy,"Though I love the Mitford series, this one is a waste of time. Additionally, while I found the other books in the series quaint, I found this one just plain sappy. I hope Ms. Karon takes the time to write an interesting book next time, rather than selling out to her publishers."
1,What a Waste!,"I had truly enjoyed the Mitford characters in the first 5 books and anxiously waited for this book's release. However, as other reviewers have stated, I too bought the hardcover thinking it was a continuation of the other books. This book reads like a marketing ploy ..."
3,Much too short!,I too read this in one sitting. It was more of a short story than a novel. Ms. Karon's other books ran 350-400 pages. This was a mere 180 with HUGE margins. I was very disappointed.
3,A blast from the past,"This was a nice little story; it was good to hear some kind of news from Mitford even if it isn't exactly fresh. I had to wonder if Jan Karon is getting extremely burned out, yet feels compelled to keep writing about Father Tim just to hush the clamoring of her many fans who are hungry to read about where Father Tim and Cynthia left off. As pleasant as this was, I am not particularly looking forward to the Christmas novella unless it can provide something new. This all goes to show that writing books for a living probably isn't as nifty a job as we readers all think it is."
3,Better a novella,"It was nice to get invited to the wedding. I was always sorry it was skipped over. Yes - it could have been a longer book. Yes - the margins are rather wide. But it was a lot of fun to hear all the details about the flowers and food and people. So if you arent a die - hard fan, you might want to wait and read a library copy, or borrow it from a friend."
2,"good book, but expensive","I knew what the book was going to be about, and did enjoy the story, but felt that for $20+ list price, it was rather expensive for such a small book. (Yes, the graphics were beautiful, but I'd rather have had a smaller price tag and less artwork.) If I could, I'd give it 4 stars for story and 1 for value for money."
1,Not up to snuff!,"I ordered 4 copies prepublication, for myself and three friends who are devotees of the series. Next time I will wait until I can peruse a copy before ordering! ""Common Life"" is closer to novella than novel, with its double spacing and chapter illustrations attempting to stretch a work rather lean on true material. I was disappointed that it did not further the Mitford saga, but merely expanded on a small retrospective piece. I hope Jan Karon has a more substantive novel in the works for her fans, or her following will greatly dwindle."
2,"DISAPPOINTED, CONFUSED AND A LITTLE MIFFED TOO!","Okay, I know this book was promoted as a short novel about the wedding but what was the point in writing it in the first place? If Jan Karon wanted to write about the wedding then this should have been the third book. Most of us Mitford fans were looking forward to a continuation of the story and this is not it. In my opinion, this book was disappointing, shallow and seemed to be just a way to get another book out there for us to buy. I hope Jan gets back on track and continues the story ( the next two books don't sound too promising either- Father Tim's quotations and hymns and the Mitford Snowmen? What snowmen ( never mind, I don't really care ) just get on with the story. PLEASE!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I knew before buying this book that it was about the wedding of Fr. Tim and Cynthia. But I was still very diappointed in the shortness of it, and the skipping over Ms. Karon seemed to do for a lot of the characters. There should've been more in the book of the people and their thoughts on the wedding. There is no real substance to this book compared to her others. It's almost as if someone tried to write this in Ms. Karon's place. And, for as long as it took for this book to come out, you'd think she could've done better."
2,Doesn't fit,"This book, about a third the size of the others in the series, appears to be something left over or deleted from about the second volume. ""A Common Life"" is way out of sequence and just isn't very interesting. It deals solely with the marriage of Father Tim and has little to do with Mitford or the other characters. I found the novel (it is scarcely that) a real disappointment, compared with the first four books of the series. If the author felt that the information therein was significant, why was it not included at the appropriate place in time? The question is never answered."
2,An After-thought?,"Having read & thoroughly enjoyed the first five Mitford novels, I was anxiously awaiting book six. A Common Life is disappointing & certainly not up to Jan Karon's usual quality writing.The fact that it is out of sequence makes me feel it was an after-thought or that it was hastily written in response to readers' disappointment with lack of detailed information about Fr. Tim & Cynthia's actual wedding. Whatever the motivation, the story lacks character development, plot, & substance.If read at all, it should be read BEFORE book five!That being said...I will definitely buy In This Mountain, the seventh in the Mitford series."
2,Written by a tired Jan Karon or an indifferent committee?,"Compared to her earlier Mitford books, this one was a major disappointment. Not much text even though the hardcover book was 186 pages long: too much white space including wide margins on each page. The character sketches seemed more like outlines than in-depth discussions by and about the people we thought we knew. The quality of writing that I'd come to expect simply wasn't there, but perhaps the author was responding to pressure by the publisher to get this book out in a hurry. What a shame, since she's already proved she can do better."
1,Rip off from the Book of Common Prayer,"A large portion of this book is taken from the Book of Common Prayer; much of the rest is pulled from her earlier books. I've read all of her books & have enjoyed them except for this one which is different in narrative voice from her other books and really does nothing to further the story line. The book is printed on very heavy stock to give the impression that there is more to the book than there actually is. Buy this book if you like heavy stock, not if you want a good story of the caliber of Karon's other books."
1,Be Warned - This is a Huge Disappointment,"I approached this book with enormous anticipation, having loved the previous books in the series, blew through it in less than two hours and will not keep it because I cannot ever imagine wanting to re-read it, as I have done all of the earlier Mitford books, again and again. Jan Karon, having already beautifully told the story of the romance between Cynthia and Father Tim, here retells it with far less grace and almost no charm. The peripheral characters, whom all Mitford readers have come to love, are almost non-existent. What a waste of time and money!"
1,"A Common Lie, The Wanting Story by Jan Karon","There is nothing really new in this tale of a wedding. Readers of the Mitford series are well versed in the storyline. Well, there is one thing new ... I've never seen such an abudance of blank space on the pages of any book, about 25 lines per page. The pages are 5.75 in. across and the print covers 3.75 in. That's 35% of nothing - in addition to the double spacing. Maybe the book is supposed to be poetry, but it certainly isn't tree-friendly. Good-by Viking Press and Jan Karon, enjoy your money while it lasts."
1,I want more!!,"I have been anticipating the next Mitford book since finishing reading the last one. This book is a disappointment to me, as it is not what I was expecting. There was not the usual depth of characters. I did not feel like I was involved with what was going on, but was merely an onlooker. I think, to be fair, that if I were to read all the books again, and read this one in context between volumes 2 and 3, it would be alright. It took me less than a few hours to read; I had been hoping to savor it for a week or two, as I usually do. I hope this is not the last of what we hear from Mitford - I need to know what is going to happen with Dooley and siblings!"
1,Unnecessary and weak installment in the series,"I wonder which was the bigger driver in producing this book: Karon going for the green, or her fans sending her letters telling her how disappointed they were not to have been able to read about the wedding.No matter which, this is a book that should not have been written. It detracts from, rather than adds to, the series. One reviewer called it ""sappy"", and I agree. Did Father Tim suddenly enter his second childhood? Gone is his dignity, replaced by mushy dialogue. I almost expected Tim and Cynthia to start calling each other ""Pooky"" and ""Snookums"". Or did they? I'm not sure, because I was unable to finish this book."
2,A common dissapointment,"The richness that you found in all the other Mitford books was unfortunately lacking in A Common Life. The book does provide some additional insights into the much loved Mitford residents, but I found the book lacking in many areas. It would have been fun to read about the wedding arrangements and the reception. Also, I would have liked to read about the reaction that Edith had to Father Tims engagement. I hope that Jan Karon publishes further stories in the Mitford series that are as rich and enjoyable to read as the previous books."
3,A Common Life: The Wedding Story,"I was so excited to see a new Mitford book and expected it to take up where we left off at the beach. As I started reading, I thought I've already got this book. The characters are the same wonderful ones, but we need to move on. Quite disappointing I must say. I'll keep it just to say it's part of my Mitford Series, but again, I'm disappointed at the lack of imagination and rush in publishing a book just to say another one has been published. I don't want to rule out purchasing the next Mitford book, but I will think about it before buying it."
2,A very common life . . .,Disappointing for Ms. Karon's readership -- very mundane and you could skip this book entirely and not miss anything with the Mitford happenings. This is not worth the money!!
2,Disappointing,It took me several chapters to realize that the author was backtracking to a wedding that had been eluded to...two books ago in the series!! This ruined the suspense for me since I knew it had already taken place. I did not feel this book was up to the author's general standards.
3,my review,"I was surprised to find a book about details on the wedding of Father Cavanaugh and Cynthia. However, it felt good to read about all the other people in Mitford.Good easy read."
2,A common retold Tale,I always look forward to NEW books in the Mitford Series. I was very disappointed in that I was rereading history. I felt cheated even though there were details explained in this book not previously revealed. But I really didn't care about the who what and color of the flowers or bridal suit.....bring on NEW stories please!
3,Disappointing,"I knew before the book came out that it was going to be the story of Tim and Cynthia's wedding. I was very excited to learn about this episode in their lives that had been skipped in previous Mitford books. However, when the book was released, I was extremely disappointed in the writing, which seemed rushed. The characters did not come alive as they had in previous installments. I love the Mitford series, and I look forward to Ms. Karon's future books, but this one was by far the least fulfilling of the series."
1,"Do not bother to read this one, it stunk!","This book stunk. It was to mushey. I dont get what took her this long to write it. This book comparded to all her other ones stunk. Father Tim was actting like he could not live witrh out his wife. I like it when she writes about Emma & Dudley, but this book did not have much about thouse two. Also the wedding was weird. Every one was crying to much. So don't bother with this one! I hope her next book is much better and comes out faster!"
2,Disappointed,I waited a long time for a very thin book. It was good but if you took out all the empty pages and spaces it was only a 100 pages. What took her so long to write so little.
1,a common life: the wedding story (the mitford years),"I read some of the 107 reviews, I agree with most of them, there was no heart and soul in this book, It was just thrown together, I was very disappointed in this book."
1,Disappointed,"I was also disappointed by the book. Jan Karron will have two new ""money makers"" out in the fall - a Christmas story and Father Tim's book of quotes. Please Jan go back to the series!"
2,Sleeper,"Waste of time. Boring. Slow moving. Love the author. If you are a HUGE fan and have to read everything of hers, then read it. Otherwise, move on."
1,A Disappointment,"While the information on the jacket implies that this sixth book is a continuation of the story, it backtracks into an event not previously covered in detail. Moreover, this is a short story packaged as a novel - with large print, lots of white space, and little to say. Definitely a disappointment. It appears that the author ran out of original ideas but needed to make a deadline (or more money from her previously loyal fans)."
3,OK but a bit of a disappointment,"This wasn't one of Jan's best efforts. But I think she just wanted to have something out ""between books."" I'd sure recommend reading Hickam's Coalwood books in the meantime - October Sky and The Coalwood Way - better in a lot of ways than Mitford!"
1,Who wrote this book?,"Any faithful reader of the Mitford series could have written this book. I love the first five books in the series dearly and highly recommend all of them to everyone. But, A Common Life: The Wedding Story is not in the same class. There is precious little really new in the book and the writing doesn't look familiar. Perhaps it is because of the various view points. However, that approach could be interesting and give us new insights into the supporting characters. But, it gives us very little.We love you Jan and we'll be waiting for book 7 (and 8 and...)."
4,A Delight,"For anyone who read the other Mitford Years books, this one fills in the gaps about the wedding of Cynthia and Father Tim. It actually is very quick reading, easily read in a night or two. I love all the Mitford Books. However, I always missed the important parts that she leaves out between the books, such as the wedding. I was thrilled to finally see how Father Tim and Cynthia were wed.There is something very genuine and soothing about her writing. There is nothing of nudity, cursing or immoral behavior that is found in so many books. Her writing is relaxing and truly enjoyable."
2,Trite,"A Common Life lacks the delightful storyline and dialogue that characterize the earlier Mitford books. In this book, the writer does not produce the character depth, spiritual tone, and charming witticisms of her earlier novels. I would not have guessed it as the work of the same author. Overall, I was very disatisfied with this purchase and do not recommend it to Mitford fans. It spoiled the series for me. Be content with the other volumes."
5,Excellent Reading,This book is easy reading. It is well worth reading each one of the Mitford series. So freshing.
4,A Common Life: The Wedding Story,Another in the wonderful Mitford series - I have enjoyed each up-lifting book! The characters become like family and neighbors; you laugh and cry with each one; and as soon as you finish one book you can hardly wait to read the next.
5,Another great one by Jan Karon!,While this book was shorter... it was nevertheless a great story! It is well worth the money and time!Mitford is the kind of place that we would all love to live.... a slpeey little town in the mountains where you know your neighbors. I recommend buying this book... and curling up in your favorite chair with a warm blanket and cup of hot chocolate! Turn the phones off and slip away... I guarentee that you won't want to come back!
2,Not her best,"I have loved all the previous books in this series but was disappointed with this one. It didn't have much plot or story line other than ""they get married"". The other books had so much more depth, drama and character development. Any drama that might of been present was taken away by the fact that the book is out of place in the series. Anyone who read the earlier books already knows what happens in the marriage, in Dooley's life and the other story lines."
1,Adolescent,"If I could return this book, and receive a refund, I most certainly would. How disappointing to find Karon resorting to an adolescent review of the marriage event. This indicates to me that she is out of material, and has given us this poor substitute in lieu of a true sequel. Unfortunately, this too often happens when an author has enjoyed financial success with previous books. They start to churn out dribble that has dialogue that even a thirteen year old would find laughable. Oh for the days when an author only published a work that reflected work, not speed. I will not buy any more of this author's books. Based upon this latest ""effort"", I see that she has nothing left to give that is worth my money."
1,What a Letdown!,"The Mitford books have affected my life in such a positive way, and I felt somewhat cheated after finishing this book a day after starting it. There was little plot, and while the character insights were nice to read, there was nothing to hang on to, nothing to go back to time and time again like every other Mitford book. I've read the series many times over the years when I'm feeling down or needed to be inspired, and this is one volume I'll skip in the future."
2,Where's The Beef????,"I was so looking forward to reading this book, even though I knew it was not the next one in the series. I knew it was to be a book about the wedding, but I am really disappointed and surprised at the 'lack' of story. I have to agree with fellow reviewers; the short pages and the margins make it appear as a 'short story' rather than a book. For the price, it is very deceiving!! You can easily read the book in a little over an hour's time. Although, it was nice to be with old friends again (Father Tim, Cynthia, Dooley, Emma, Uncle Billy and Rose, etc.), they only appear in very minor ways. I want my Mitford friends back! I want the strange ending of A New Song wrapped up and let's go home to Mitford for the next adventure in the series. This book seemed like it was just written on a whim without much thought put into it. I'm a huge Mitford fan and have loved every book in the series; I am really disappointed in this one."
1,wish i hadn't bought it,"Like the last two reviewers, I purchased this book on the strength of the previous Mitford books. This book is so sappy and lacking in plot that I will think twice before buying the next installment in the series. If I could give this book less than one star I would."
1,wish I could give it no stars,"so bad I could hardly pick it back up after taking a break. sappy, shallow, clealry only a ploy to make some more money from a story that was already told. from what it looks like, we're in for more of the same--the christmas story and the book of quotes advertised in the back of the book. I wouldn't even consider buying more of the same drivel."
2,Utterly bewildered,"To say that this newest Mitford book has confused me is too simple a statement. Beyond the vague details and sketchy facts contained in the body of the work, the syntax in which this wedding story appeared in the overall scope of this series leaves devoted readers trying to remember which events had happened at the time the wedding occurred and which had yet to unfold. Hadn't Dooley already bonded with Cynthia? Or was he still surly and unforgiving? Reading this installment had the exact opposite effect of the others--it made me tired and addled where the first five have been a balm to my soul every time I have lost myself in them. Sadly, this one will most likely not be revisited as often as the first five. I look forward to the next trip to Mitford, whenever Ms. Karon is ready."
1,Very Disapointed,"I always wondered why the wedding story wasn't covered in its proper place. Obviously Jan Karon didn't want to write about it and this is even more evident in this book. It is a brief look at the wedding without any real depth into the characters or insight into the many events, decisions and thoughts that led up to the wedding and could have included the wonderful citizens of Mitford. Each book in the series has gotten shorter but this one at 185 very skimpy pages seems to be nothing more than a way to exploit the many fans of Mitford."
1,Cheated!!,"I received an email from Amazon to let me know that Jan Karon had a ""new"" book out in the Mitford series. I should have read the reviews before ordering. Rather than a continuation of the series, this short story disguised as a book, goes back to between the second and third books. What a ripoff."
3,Sweet...,"This mundane novel is something that would appeal to my grandmother..simple, quaint, well written. It is a geat book for a young girl, but for an adult reader it lacks the ability to hold one's interest. Perfectly harmless, but it makes for a dull read--a filler type story for when you simply want to pass the time..."
2,stretching too far,"I enjoyed the whole Mitford series as a delightful and enjoyable escape. Therefore I was disappointed after reading Karon's latest. It was entertaining and was a satisfying completion of the series but it could have been included in the previous book instead of stretching it into another book. I read the whole thing in a couple of hours. The pages of this book had wide margins and was obviously straining to fill enough pages to make a book. I don't like feeling that an author is taking advantage of her public. Having said all this, I still enjoyed finishing up the series with the marriage. It was sweet and left me with a warm fuzzy feeling."
1,A Common Life - A Big Disappointment,I loved her other books but feel this book was put together just to have another book. A big disappointment to me.
2,A Common Life,"This book appears to have been written simply to hold the readers until the next book in the series (hopefully with some substance) is released. I should have had a clue when I saw how few pages the book has. Definitely not pn a par with the previous 5 books. I, as a reader before me suggested, would recommend that those reading the series check this one out from the library."
4,Charming,"At first I was a little confused when I began this book, because I was expecting book six. Hey, why are we going backwards?! Once I got into it, it turned out to be a very nice read, especially if you were dying to know what happened at the wedding. Short but sweet (I read it in a little over an hour, but I'm fast) Karon once again showed her talent for touching our hearts with universal emotions."
2,Dissapointed,I have been hooked in Mitford since book one. I could hardly wait for the books to come out. I felt the same about A common Life. I was the first one at the store to buy it. As I sat down to read it I was so dissapointed. The book was short and had no interesting story lines. We all knew that they were going to get married. I expected more.
2,Not Up to Ms. Karon's Usual Standards,"I am a huge fan of the Mitford series, but this latest entry is a real disappointment. Rather than carrying the story of Father Tim and his wife, Cynthia, forward, this book is a return to the story of their wedding. After reading this slight effort, I came to the conclusion it was written more for its marketing than its literary value. I think Ms. Karon wants this book to become a stand-alone gift book for weddings, much like the Dr. Seuss book on age is a perennial best-seller as a graduation gift. But if you aren't already a fan of the series, this book won't mean anything, and if you are a fan of the series, this book is a disappointment. If Ms. Karon wanted to write a wedding book, why didn't she write about Dooly's wedding and move the story along? Not her best effort."
2,disappointed,"Thank goodness I borrowed this book from the library... I would have been very upset if I purchased it! This book should not have been listed as ""the sixth book in the bestselling Mitford Years series"" as it implies it is a continuation of the prior books that are written in chronological order; somewhere the words PREQUEL should have been included. Details provided in this book could have been included in a previous book of the series; A Common Life was too wordy and too religious giving this reader the impression it was written to fulfill Jan Karon's contract. I enjoy reading about life in Mitford, but will thoroughly research future books in the series before reading them."
1,Hugely Disappointing...Don't Bother,With the use of maximum margins and a large font the minimal content of this book is nothing but fluff. I'm a big fan of the series but would rather have waited for an addition with some substance.
4,Sweet Story,"I liked this book and thought the story was very sweet. I also thought it did a good job showing the older child how things will be changing while mommy is pregnant and after the baby is born. Although my son seemed to enjoy the story, he does not request to read the book very often."
4,great conversation starter,I read this book with my 3 1/2 year old. I am expecting twins and she has been the only child/grandchild for a long time. This book opened up some conversations and made it easier for her to talk and ask questions. She wanted to know if I will hold her again after the babies are born and be able to play with her )I have been on bedrest). It also gave me a great idea to have a special project for her and I after the babies come. We are going to buy some ladybugs and watch them grow in her bug farm. The mom in the book takes time out for her son to hang a birdfeeder.
5,Another book you might like: On Mother's Lap,"If you like this book, I recommend ""On Mother's Lap"" by Ann Herbert Scott. My older child and I enjoyed reading this together before our new baby was born.On Mother's Lap"
1,Gross,The sole is okay but the stuffing is gross. It's mostly breading and is really nasty in would never eat is again. My husband took 1 bite And could not eat anymore.
5,Awesome,"I tried this from a package direct from Omaha Steaks and fell in love with this item, so I just ordered more from Amazon.com."
2,back ache problems,Dissappointed in its length. It is longer than necessary and extends over to my wife's side of the bed.Had to give it up and continue using a pillow under my knees.When I find some one who can use it I will give it the them
2,Very hard and rigid,"Over long, hard, not flexible at all; actually uncomfortable. I don't use it and cannot return it. Do not recommend it."
2,Too hard! And not the right shape fo me,"This wedge is just too hard and not at the right angle fo me. I kept it because it was difficult to return and with a couple of other pillows it works to some degree; but finally I actually went out and paid $80 for a different shaped wedge at my local 'relax the back' store. I am sure there is something similar here at amazon; however, in this case, I thought it paid to support my local bricks and mortar store where I could try it out."
3,"Slightly helpful,","but no better than a couple of pillows.Unless you are a very small person, this is practically useless. I wouldn't choose to order it again. I'm 5'7"" and don't find it helps very much at all. The person in the picture must be very tiny."
4,Does it's job,The pillow is firm enough not to squish down like a regular pillow. It's worth the money.I bought this pillow because I have the tendency to rollover to my stomach in the middle of the night which results in me waking up with back pain. This pillow helps keep me on my back.
2,Not what I hoped for,I've been dealing with Back issues for 12 yrs now and have gone threw SO many bolsters & wedges trying to find one that is high enough and firm enough. I can't seem to find both in ONE item. This was perfect in length but after a wk of having it under your knees it flattens to almost level with your legs. The foam would need to be higher or if the foam was harder it would have been fine. Unfortunately Im stuck with it and am off in search of another. If anyone knows of one please let me know.
2,Not what I expected,I was looking for something about half as tall and half as long to put under my knees at night. This was WAY too big.
4,Good for my back.......,Just experimenting to see what works for my back. This does better than 3 pillows. I may want something higher. Good service and good product.
3,Leg cushion,The product is far to large for my use. I am sure it would fit the need for others. I am trying to find a way to reduce the size in order to use it on just one leg.
3,Great beginners reference book for beginners!!,"This is a great reference book for beginners... I myself am a seasoned systems analyst and already had books that covered most of the basic topics discussed in this book. There were no real world examples and nothing about the pitfalls of using web standards before they are even supported by popular browsers. Like I said at first, it is a really great reference book; and if you need one to get started, this is it! You will still need a book dealing with the methodology variations in coding."
2,Could of been much better,I new this book was not for beginners as I have done some html programming before. However I think this book is total waste if you never done any html programming before. The content sometimes can be confusing and just today I realised there was a bug in one of the examples. If there wasnt google or reference websites like [...] I think I would really srtuggle with this book. I am refering to most of the references from w3schools and trying to get some theory from this book. I think I should of done some more search before I baught this book because I definitely think there are much better books than this.
5,Hi-tech Cables,I got these to use with my new Marantz cd player. The cables that came with it were not shielded so I got these to make sure I did not pick up any interference.Can I hear the difference? Not really. If you read the packaging it appears that a lot of research went into this cables construction.They work fine and at less than $7 it was worth making sure I don't get outside emanations on my audio.
1,D.O.A.: Defective on Arrival -- and Worse,"One plug would not go into a jack. On inspecting the plug, I found that the central pin had been mounted at an angle during manufacturing. Checked the package: made in China. But the waste does not end there: this little cable comes packaged in a huge plastic shell that can't be opened without dangerous knife maneuvers. Such packaging is a sign of a dismal, second-rate company. It is a shame what has happened to Acoustic Research."
5,more from the master....,"Ryan Moore does it again...vital, lush dub with the trademark big basslines and beautiful melodies...all I can say is that this man is, in my opinion, a dub genius...'dub voyage' is exactly that, a voyage through some of the most intoxicating soundscapes ever to bless speakers (or even better headphones)...sit back, light up, and relax..."
3,Twilight Circus Dub Sound System - 'Dub Voyage' (M Records),"Legendary Pink Dot's multi-instrumentalist Ryan Moore's 2000 side project. Best described as 'electronic dub'. Not my favorite TCDSS title (as I didn't realize TCDSS had at least a dozen CD's out), but it's okay - is it just me or is this release more reggae-like than the other Twilight Circus Dub Sound System discs? I, myself have only heard three of them. Tracks here that make for a good listen are ""Acetate"", ""Depth Charge"", ""Fast"" (reminds me of The Orb) and ""Slicer"". Listen to this site's sound bites, then go from there."
5,A Powerful Tale of Suspense!,"Sometimes the atmosphere of a novel is so powerfully rendered that the setting assumes the importance of another character. Mary Higgins Clark has this nack, and so does Mitzi Pool Bridges. She has a talent for vivid descriptions of the characters, their thoughts and actions. This book is a page turner with a razor-edged plot. It is one that you will not be able to put down. It is such a satisfying read filled with emotion, and laden with dynamic characters. This is a story to savor long after you've finished it."
5,Great book to read to toddlers!,"We received this book in a book club offer and it was our first experience with Thomas. That said, it's one of our favorites after 4 years of constant reading! The illustrations are SO much better than other books - the children and other characters look more like cartoon drawings instead of the ""wooden"" figures that you see in the videos. We prefer that in our house quite a bit. Also, the children are so grateful for Thomas picking them up in the end when Bertie breaks down, that one of the little girls gives him a kiss. Thus, sending Thomas into a very cute blush at the end of the story.A very cute story - Ages newborn up to first to second grade. Highly recommend!"
4,Loving Children,"In this little book we have Thomas, a train who loves children.The children are going on a school trip, but Thomas has work that he must do and he can't take them. Thomas is sad. Sir Topham Hatt tells Thomas if he does his job and hurries back, he can take them home. On his journey Thomas learns that by doing his job things have a way of working out for us. He learns how important it is to help others. This is a simple book for children to read, with short sentences and colorful illustrations."
4,Amazing and Rare Footage of China's Silk Road,"If you are even slightly interested in Asian Culture and/or rare footage of unknown cultures, this film will satisfy you. It covers the 6 month journey taken by many Chinese that was (and still is to some extent) the engine of the Chinese economy. There is also footage of personal culture (ie: marriage, harvesting rituals, days of celebration, etc..).Click here to read my more in depth review.Marco Polo's Silk RoadHope this helped."
1,Is this for real?,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer. I found this book in a $1 box at B&N and decided to get it to send to a kid in one of those chain letter things. After getting home and reading it, I am almost ashamed to send it. The other reviewer's sum-up of the story is perfect. There's nothing to it and the lemmings just act dumb. Don't bother with this one. Its a waste."
4,information in an entertaining way,"There's a lot of information in here, most of it presented in a nicely readable way. I did fade out a bit over the medicines and drugs; those you hear so much about. The section about the attempt to develop silk production in the US was new to me, and had a personal connection to the mulberry trees I used to have. One lesson to draw from these stories of where people's enthusiasms have led is to beware of the next great idea a politician or potential reformer is dedicated to promoting. But we do seem to muddle along past the disasters again and again."
1,What a crock,"I read this book hoping that it would be in the same class as J Ernst Berendt's books "" The Third Ear"" and ""The World is Sound""This man has a completely narrowminded, and blinkered viewpoint, and if it is something that is not withing his little intellectual fram of reference, then it must be associated with evil. It's more like David Lame than David Tame. His incessant tirade against Jazz and Polyrhythmic structures shows a poor understanding of music as well as a narrowminded bigotry towards non western art forms....what a crock coming form a musical idiot!!!!!"
3,"hit the nail on it's head, miss the point","Mister Tame writes a provocative book.His research is excellent and he brings forward interesting topics that should be at the core of the teachings of music theory. But...His analysis is weak and one sided. Contemporary music brought about a much needed discussion on spirituality, allowing for great religion to be viewed in their similarities.Music is an art that use sound and non-sound and can not be defined by acoustic principles of tones although it may use this element.The study of Tones (as differentiable angles) and resonance should be studied from kindergarden to universities. It is important and that could really change the world for the better.The judgement pronounced on many musical work is shallow. He doesn't understand the true function of music and he is accusing many of materialism while himself seem trapped in that cloud.Any way, a book worth being read!"
5,Radical Dreaming knocks the others right off the shelf...,"Dr. John Goldhammer's ""Radical Dreaming"" is groundbreaking, brilliant, and ultimately freeing for folks like myself who wish to uncover their true essence. The author goes to battle with much more than a pen; rather, he (to borrow from one of his images) ""pulls the sword from the stone"" in his own life and images, leaving the reader with only inspiration and courage to fight for his or her authenticity. And I've read many dream books before this one, but this book by far knocks the others right off the shelf...BUY it, READ it, and LOVE it!"
