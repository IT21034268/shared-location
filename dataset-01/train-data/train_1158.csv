4,"Very nice, but I had one problem","This is a very nice set. However, I had a pot that didn't sit down flat. It wobbled. When I contacted Cuisinart they said I'd have to ship it in and pay for the shipping myself. Wish they'd have an option making it easier on me so I don't have to pay $20 shipping a factory defective heavy pot when I've already paid over $200 for the set."
1,Spots and sticking issues on first use,"As with other people who recently reviewed this product, I experienced spots and discolorations on the pans after their first use. I also had issues with eggs sticking to the bottom of the skillet even with the help of cooking oil. I was overwhelmed by the overall positive reviews of this product, but upon closer inspection I noticed a trend that the more recent reviews tended to be negative. Based on the issues I experienced I decided to return this set."
2,"Cooks fast, but everything sticks and can't clean!","I bought this set after reading the fabulous reviews, but I seem to be missing something...Everything sticks to the pans, rendering them practically unusable! We've resorted to using our old non-stick pans because these are terrible. No matter how much oil or butter I put in the pan, the food sticks right away and won't come free. Can someone please explain what I'm doing wrong?Then, we have the hardest time cleaning these. Even if I've just boiled some potatoes in the pots, it's practically impossible to clean the residue off. The pans are even more difficult to clean.I'm really disappointed, since we spend all this money on a new set and now don't even want to use it.The only positive about this set, is they do heat up quickly.I've watched a bunch of YouTube videos on how to cook with stainless and how to clean it, I'm not doing anything differently, but yet these still don't work.Would appreciate any techniques people have who enjoy this set."
3,not as advertised,"The pots & pans are really nice, very hard to clean after cooking something. Lids are cheap at best and they should be glass for the cost of the package. Handles on the pans or pots don't get hot fast. My biggest thing is that when I cook something they are VERY hard to clean up."
2,Cleaning is NOT easy! Food sticks to the PAN!,"The Cuisinart cookware is more like artwork, that looks good hanging up in the kitchen, but when it's actually used, it's difficult to keep food from sticking in the pan and clean-up is difficult. The cookware says to not use any steel-wool for clean-up, using only soapy water and a dish rag. If that doesn't work, Cuisinart suggests to let the pan soak in warm water or boil the stuff of the pan, returning the dirty pot to the stove (not very practical). The best way to use this stainless steel product is to place a little bit of water into the pan, after spraying it heavily with non-stick (PAM) or using a lot of olive oil. Suggestion: when cleaning of caked on food, heat up the pan and pour cold water on the pan (over the sink) to instantly remove the food ... and you'll likely still use an abrasive pad to remove some food particles. The price is reasonable ... but, the cookware is certainly not the best out there! Rating: 1 to 2 stars out of 5."
3,Don't get too excited,"If it's too good to be true, then it isn't true. These are decent for the price, but overall not of good quality. Don't judge a book by it's cover."
3,Havent used them yet.,"I have not used them yet just received them today. They were delivered the day after i ordered them which is great!! What is not so great is the price dropped >10% in less than 24 hours after i purchased them which is a little annoying. I will update once i get to use the item and inspect further, but for now i like the shipping speed, hate the price drop."
1,Pan Handles fell off after only 5 years,"I have always loved these pans until the handle welds failed. Cuisinart wants me to mail them the pots and lids at my expense, they will determine who is at fault, then they will charge me to mail the pans back. Oh yeah, and they said that the lids are not under warranty - despite that there is the exact problem with the lid handle... so I have a stockpot with only one handle, and a lid for another pan with no handle and the company wants me to be out $40 in postage costs to determine if they are at fault.... I am kind of pissed, as I purchased this ""quality"" set to last my lifetime ."
5,Uncomparable in looks and price,Purchased for Thanksgiving 2011. Made great impression. Cookware is functional and looks amazing. Not sure yet about cooking eggs as they seem to stick to the pan. May be because I have never used this type (SS)item before and need to read up on how to best use. You will love this item and for the price you cannot beat it. 5 Stars
5,Great Cookware - Just What I Was Looking For!,"I purchased this Cuisinart cookware set after looking at a number of other different brand sets, including AllClad which despite it's good reputation, I found to be TOO heavy - this will probably be my last set I purchase (my last set lasted me 25 years), and I wanted something I could handle when I'm 75 as well. I have been perfectly happy with my decision. This cookware is well made, heavy (without being too heavy), cleans up well in the dishwasher and out, and is everything I was looking for. Food cooks evenly, and I don't have to worry about the dangers of aluminum and non-stick coatings, since it is stainless steel. Great job, Cuisinart! I received my order within days of placing the order on Amazon - they always deliver quickly and without a problem. I wholeheartedly recommend this cookware set!"
2,Metal pitting,The first time I used the 3.5 qt saute pan it pitted in two spots on the inside bottom of the pan. I was cooking onions and potatoes. Nothing reactive and using teflon spatula. I'm not taking a chance with the rest of it and returning for refund.
3,"Nice Set, but pans warp really easy...","Owned for about 2-months, purchased this set to upgrade from our cheap dated T-Fal set. I really like the way the set looks and it's nice to not have to worry about scratching a non-stick finish off; however, all but 1 of the pans have warped and no longer sit flat on the cook top. This is rather disappointing since the pans are very bottom heavy and this was one of the main reasons I purchased. Next step will be to contact the manufacturer (Cuisinart) about replacements - - - - and no, have not heated them on the stove with nothing in them.Overall, I would recommend the set due to quality look and feel; but be cautious of warpage."
5,Love this cookware!,"I purchased the Cuisinart MCP-12 cookware only after researching all other cookware brands. I found that this cookware had more and better reviews than its competitors. While I've only owned this cookware a short time, I've cooked on it everyday. Following the directions that came with the cookware, I haven't had any problems with food sticking or burning. Cleanup has been a breeze with Barkeepers Friend. I highly recommend this cookware for anyone wanting stainless steel cookware, just remember to follow all the cooking and cleaning directions that come with it."
3,"Not as pleased, as written reviews were high","Product cooks very well but when i tried to clean with just mild soap and water, food does not easily come off. Also, left small bubbles on bottom of cookware after use. My brand new set of pots that were just used twice looks used looking inside. With careful cleaning and shinning, they should not look that way just after two times of use. Not happy with this product."
4,Very good quality,These pots & pans are very good quality. They cook evenly and I love that you can put them in the oven. They are not very heavy to lift which is very good since I have bad wrists. But they are heavy duty enough to feel tough. You should never put them in the dishwasher but that's ok they are easy enough to clean. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because they get kinda streaky once in a while and you have to use a citrus juice to clean them really well. Other than that they are great.
4,Cookware for life,"Love it, love it, love it. After much research, I picked this set of cookware, and I do love it. Some of the other reviewers were right about a few things...my handles can get hot if I'm not careful and the pans are more difficult to clean to keep that bright shine. But it's still fabulous stuff. I wish I had more cupboard space because they are getting scratches from being stacked so tight in my cupboard. But that's life. Love the pans though. I'll have them forever."
5,Fantastic Set,"I read a lot of reviews on cookware before purchasing this set. I was looking very hard for any flaws as I cooked the first few meals. So far, I have had the set a few months, it still looks great, and I followed the basic instructions that said not too cook on high heat; I have not had a problem with food sticking. The set has been easy to clean, and I am very happy that the handles stay cool.. The pots are sturdy, but not too heavy. Overall, I am very impressed."
5,Cuisinart Multi Clad Pro Cookware,"Excellent set of pots and pans. High quality, induction ready, good price, lengendary Amazon service. Very please with this purchase. Cookware performs very well in real use."
3,not always 18/10,"i apologize if this is a repeat.i just called cusinart. the product used to be produced exclusively with 18/10 stainless and now she said that has been replaced with 100% stainless. i honestly don't know the difference - maybe someone can enlighten me - i just know in the reading that i have done on cookware it always suggests looking for 18/10 stamped on the bottom. she said some products out there might still contain the 18/10 and the only way to tell is to look at the bottom of your cookware for the 18/10 stamp. if it is not there, it is not 18/10.hope this is helpful."
5,Great so far!,"I've had this set for about three weeks now. I replaced a set of cookware that we got for our wedding 19 years ago. It was definitely time! They take a bit longer to heat up, as they definitely distribute heat more evenly than our old, cheap set. I love the steamer for veggies. It doesn't boil over like the old one! I also like all of the sizes. Things do tend to stick, so use a nonstick spray if you're making eggs or something that's notoriously sticky. You'll probably still need a nonstick pan or two. If you follow the instructions and soak them right away, they wash up very nicely, though.I haven't yet used them in the oven or created a lot of dishes, but I'm looking forward to having this cookware for many years and using each pot and pan in lots of different ways. The construction is very solid, and I expect it to be very durable. I was checking out a much more expensive set the other day, and I honestly think this is just as well made. It's a bargain!"
4,Great Pans,"The pans have worked great so far, or so my husband says since he does all the cooking. However I wash them and so far I haven't had a problem getting food off except potatoes. We don't cook eggs on them but they are great for everything else as long as you cook in the heat specified with the instructions. We also bought the stainless steal cleaner which works great."
4,Happy Wife,So far I am very happy. One thing that I did learn from using the pans is that I have to heat everything at a much lower temp.
3,Strainer does not double as a steamer,"I bought two sets of these as presents for my children last Christmas but due to moving and etc. they didn't open them until May. They say they are dishwasher safe and although it does recommend hand washing, we put them in the dishwasher and the finish changed. Disappointing but not a show stopper. Then we wanted to steam vegetables and found out that it is a strainer which is not the same as a steamer. We thought they were the same thing. It does not fit into a pan so that you can put a lid on it and close it to steam the vegetables. That would have been a show stopper if I had realized that before I bought them. The pans are nice and well balanced. I love the multi-clad. It is very important to cook on low heat as they burn quickly which is great saving of energy. As it turned out, the sizes of the pans aren't as useful as the set that I bought at a discount outlet for my other daughter. I would have preferred a smaller pot rather than so many skillets."
5,pots and pans are awesome,I am very pleased with my cuisinart pots. A bit heavier then i imaginedwhen flipping product or lots of liquid volume. Cleans up nicer then i was used to with my old anolon set. Lids are perfect. Husband is now cooking up a storm ...he feels like he is on iron chef now..... what a joy to cok with lower heat and even cooking....the product description and other testimonials did not lie. These are a great value for the price.Gotta go get more saute recipes.......
4,mr angry,"Good value,cleans up well, looks good,makes food taste good, and by-golly it does yer good.LIDS ARE A BIT ON THE LIGHT SIDE.I would recommend these pans."
3,Not sure,"I have no issues with Amazon's service or shipping. I received the items promptly and in good condition. I was disappointed when I saw on the bottom of the box, ""Made in China"". If I would have known this set was of Chinese manufacture, I would not have ordered it. Now I wonder what toxins are in the product, and am upset that my money has gone to China. I would like to see Amazon require the indication of the country of origin for all of the items on the its web site."
2,Made in China,"Good price, but what's the cost? Buy American made products. It's patriotic, environmentally conscious (less shipping) and supports our troubled economy. True, All-Clad lids are made in China, but the pans are all American and carry a lifetime warranty."
1,Terrible product,The pans all had permanent damage after their first time use. One pan was chosen to be sent back for replacement and Cuisinart took my money and never gave me the pan. Customer Service is horrible and I have filed a BBB report. I have been having a problem with their CS since March. I bought the set in Feb. Never again!
1,Cheap knockoff product,"This cookware is a cheaply made in China knockoff of the original Cuisinart French product. The handles are very thin and difficult to grasp and hold onto. Compared these to available store bought Original Cuisinart French cookware at HomeGoods, Marshall's,Macy's, etc and found the better original cookware available there.Always look for the word French, not Chiina when you shop for these. Cheap is Cheap -you get what you pay for."
4,Good for the price,"For the price, I think it's a very good stainless steel cookware. It won't work for cooking eggs, they will stick very bad, but most of the stainless steel pans are like that unless the cost a fortune. Eventually you will get some spots hard to get out on soap but if you put some vinegar (the cheap kind) and add salt and scrub that a little and they'll be like new."
5,Couldn't Be Happier !!,"This product is exactly what we have been searching for. Heavy Duty, Easy to clean,Comfortable Handles and Tight fitting lids. As with all Stainless Steel you must adjust you cooking method to a lower heat setting. As long as you keep that in mind you will love this cookware.As a matter of fact we loved it so much that we purchased every single piece of Multiclad Pro Stainless that Cuisinart makes. WE JUST LOVE IT!!"
3,This Won't Cover All Your Needs,"I purchased the Cuisinart stainless steel set with high hopes. What I have...is cookware that I cannot use to cook essential things, like meat. No matter what you do....cold meat will stick to the bottom of the pans. You can put butter, oil or water in the bottom....and you will not be able to brown anything. I can't cook eggs in them, I can't cook rice a roni. I can't cook any meat without it sticking, unless I boil it. Now, after spending a large sum of money on this set, I have to buy more, that are nonstick...to prepare my meals. It's a huge disappointment to me. The quality of the items themselves? Fantastic. But it won't cover all my needs, and there's the rub. I bought them here because Amazon offered the best price, but what good is saving money if I can't do all my cooking with it? I have to buy more now."
4,Great set of pots and pans!!!,"Cooks food even and warms up fast. Easy clean up, dont have to scrub and scrub pan, just a little dish soap and there clean."
5,Why spend more for the same?,"Many have written real lengthy extensive reviews here which I cannot add to but agree. The quality and materials of construction are easily on par with cookware costing much much more. Seeing this set, it makes no sense why anyone should pay more if for nothing else than a name. You cannot go wrong with this set (or any other from this series). Cooking in a good stainless set just makes the whole experience so much better, especially knowing that it is so much safer than a non-stick set."
4,Beautiful and functional cookware,"Very happy with this cookware, performs as described and very easy to maintain. Did have a bit of trouble with a fried egg sticking the first time I used the small fry pan but I think I may have had the temperature too high as the next time I used the pan I had no trouble with it all. Would recommend to anyone contemplating a multiclad product. I have a set of All-Clad cookware as well and these perform just as well and continue to look brand new even after much use as long as I use a non-abrasive cleaner. Also, they are dishwasher safe but I prefer to wash them by hand as sometimes they come out of the dishwasher looking a bit stained but as soon as I clean them with the non-abrasive cleaner they look new again."
4,Cuisinart Multi-Clad Stainless Steel Pans,"After buying a ceramic flat-top stove, we had to replace our good reliables with pans with a flat bottom. After much consideration, we bought selected pans of this Cuisinart group. We've been fans of stainless steel cookware for some 35 years. Stainless steel is hygienic and cleans easily -- at most, with a short soak in hot water and they clean with a swipe. We are very happy with our new Cuisinart Multi-Clads.The only negatives for us are:1. The lid handles get hot; need a potholder2. The pan handles are somewhat flat which makes them harder to grip; someone else might not find it so. (These handles DO stay cool throughout cooking though, unlike the lid handles.)We gave these pans 5 stars because they cook very well, are sturdy & well-made, clean easily, and work with a ceramic flat-top cooking surface. We would buy them again."
5,Cuisinart Set.,This set looks beautiful and cooks even better. Food cooks at a lower temperature and always tastes delicious having been cooked perfectly. Steaming requires very little water with the tight fitting lids. I am delighted with this purchase.
1,Listen to most recent reviews,"from day one, these things stained very easily even from basic cooking, like an egg. Weird brown stains up along the sides. The bottom is a mess too. If I scrub real hard I can get most off the inside bottom of the pan. I read the directions, used low heat, use oil, tried bar keepers friend to clean. I am tired of trying to clean these things.Sending back the two fry pans, paying for shipping, will see what happens. Might want to consider spending a bit more and get the best."
4,Commitment maker,"These are tough to review because they take a lot of care, but are better for your health in the long run. There are certain ways to use and clean stainless steel cookware, and you must follow them or you'll get frustrated. It sure beats the cancer causing non-stick options though, so I will fight through! As I scrub off stuck on food, I will tell myself it's better than eating chemicals that cook off into our food or into the air. Using these is truly a commitment to your health. They cook food very well, but are heavy, so if you have arthritis, you may want to look for a lesser gauge steel. I'm a huge advocate for ridding the world of dangerous non-stick cookware, so do yourself and your family a favor and buy these instead."
2,poor quality,"I bought this set of pans after doing extensive research and reading all of the wonderful reviews. These pans are very nice looking, however the quality is not what it should be and is not what is described in the item description as far as foods sticking to the pans. I used one pan, once, to scramble eggs. I even used a heat deflector that I bought to use with them. I have had to soak the pan for two days and had to buy a special tool to get the egg off without scratching the pan. It was tedious and painstaking and way too much work, especially after spending hundreds of dollars on this set. I have never had a nice set of pans and am buying my first set after sixteen years of marriage. I am very disappointed with this purchase and will be returning it."
3,food seems to stick,"This is a great looking set of cookware. The rubberized lids are really nice and do not rattle at all when you have a full boil. My only complaint is that food seems to stick really badly, but this is the first time I've ever owned cookware like this so perhaps it's normal."
1,Terrible cookware,I purchased this cookware a couple of years ago and have already gotten rid of them because everything sticks to them including the nonstick spray even with butter! I finally broke down and bought some Alanon cookware and love it. I was surprised because Cuisinart is usually better than that. Definitely not worth the money.
1,Very pretty and shiney and super light weight with speedy delivery,I was so excited to find a listing on a reputable seller like amazon for such low low price. Upon receipt found that they are NOT 18/10 quality. Promptly returned. This is my third attempt at posting a review for this itrm.
5,Awesome cookware,My wife loves this cookware. She wanted a new set and after researching several types I gave her this one for Christmas. It's very durable and very nice.
5,cuisinart mcp 12,"I have to say I bought these pans based on all of the other reviews and was not disappointed. They are well made, heavy and perform quite well. I was especially happy about the lids that fit the frying pans and my favorite pan is the large sauce pan. They do water stain if you dont dry them right away but that is not a problem. Cooking is definitely more fun now...and I hate cooking! Enjoy"
4,Very good set of cookware!,"When it was finally time to upgrade from my 10 year old college cook-set, I did my fair share of homework. After reading many of the comments on this list and physically checking out the Cuisinart set at the store, I went with this set and couldn't be happier. I cook alot at home and wanted a sturdy set to last me many more years. I didn't realize good cookware REALLY makes a difference but it does! If you do decide to go with this this, I'm sure you'll be pleased!"
4,Nice pans,"After buying Rachel Ray, and Paulla Dean, pan sets that didn't last. I spent the extra money and bought an real pan set. I was worried that it not being non-stick I would have a hard time with sticking, but with a spray or a little oil. No problems. My only problem is the discoloring on the bottom of the pan from my dish washer."
3,Mediocre,"I've been using them for less than one month and I regret this purchase. They look amazing when first opened, but loose their luster and stain on the first use. They cook evenly over low fire and so far are not sticky, even though all the pans are permanently stained now. I've followed the directions the company provides for cleaning (i.e. boil soapy water and then simmer for 15 minutes; allow to cool and then wipe clean. Use wooden spoon on tough stains), but it does not work. I've used other cuisart pots and pans before and had never been this disapointed."
2,"Everything sticks, Don't waste your money!!","EVERYTHING sticks to these, they are impossible to cook with. I really regret purchasing this cookware. Avoid at all costs!!"
4,Cookware Set,"Great set. Only one short fall -- two of the lids don't fit perfectly. They fit well enough, but not as well as is advertised."
1,an awful cookware set,"Needless to say that they are very heavy, both pots and pans also discolor on my first uses. I am so regretted that I bought these junks..."
5,Awesome quality!,"Sturdy, awesome quality cooking product. We love ours and know you will too. Recommended as a must have for any home chef!"
5,Excellent Purchase,"I have owned this set for a year and a half. This is hands down the best set of pots and pans I have ever owned. This may also be the last set I ever need to buy. I couldn't be happier with them. I love to cook and use them daily. Burnt on, stuck on foods clean up easily. These are worth their weight in gold!"
5,best cookware I have owned,"for the money you cannot beat this cookware. It is a very solid, well constructed performer. Highly reccommended!"
4,just what I wanted,I read various reviews on the Cuisinart Multiclad Pro Stainless Steel set and also looked in kitchen stores at other All Clad sets. I have to say this is a terrific set and I am most happy. I have cooked both Thanksgiving and Christmas meals since my purchase and it gives you everything you need. The clean up has been easy and I have not had to do any major scrubbing of pans. I especially like how the pans heat up quickly and are not heavy to move around on your stove. Great set!
4,Great Cookware for the Right Price,"Cooks evenly and easy to clean. Beautiful stainless steel cookware with all of the pieces I need. I would have given 5 stars, but stainless steel can scratch easily when cooking even if you use the proper utensils. I searched for weeks for the best stainless cookware set for the money, and I am not disappointed w/ my purchase. I used to use teflon products and was concerned about how stainless would cook and clean, but it is great and I don't have to worry about toxins! :)"
5,Great quality cookware,"I'm not a chef and I don't work in any industry where I am in a position to test other cookware for comparison. I'm just someone who likes to cook at home. I bought these after reading the reviews and trying to find a good set of stainless steel cookware. I was making the switch to these from non-stick fans for something a little healthier and better quality. I also wanted something that was safe to use in the oven since I'm a fan of making frittatas. It took a little while getting used to cooking with a different type of pan, but after some research, I changed up my cooking techniques, and am having a much easier time adjusting to them. I even made my first good and well-formed omelette in these pans. I'm very happy with them and will probably buy the same type when I decide to expand my collection."
1,Not 18/10 - Not a good buy!,"I contacted Cuisinart to question them on why many of the recent reviews from 2011 and 2012 have been negative. They stated that they are not aware of any problems and that the only change they made is that the pans are now 100% stainless steel and not 18/10. I researched this and found that this change is likely what is causing the problems that people are having with corrosion, pitting, rust, etc. 18/10 means that they add 18% chromium and 10% nickel, which helps with shine and, more importantly, corrosion resistance. This was likely a way for Cuisinart to save money, as nickel is expensive. Unfortunately, it makes this set significantly lower in quality, in my opinion. All-Clad is 18/10, as well as good silverware sets. I really wish I had discovered this set before the change. I would not buy now."
4,'discoloration' and spots can be removed,"I saw those pictures of discoloring of the pans after cooking or boiling water. it is absolutely NORMAL! let's shed some light on this issue. those spots are not 'impurity' in the steel but in your water!! water needs nucleus to boil and those spots are most likely the minerals in the water. anyhow enough said the SOLUTION to clean it is go buy some ' bar keepers friend' or baking soda, sprinkle them onto a moist pan and rub in circular motion in the pan then rinse. guess what's gonna happen?! SHINING pans! this is the nature of stainless steel pans. you have to polish them with 'bar keepers friend' or baking soda."
3,Same quality???,"I purchased the Cuisinart MultiClad Pro stainless steel because of all the exceptional reviews here on Amazon. There were hardly any negative reviews. I guess my expectations were pretty high for the cookware. I have been disappointed in the white spots and discolorations that I've had. I do use the Bar Keepers Friend or vinegar to clean it up. The discolorations and spots are from med to low heat. I have bumped up the heat, however, when I boil water as it took forever to heat up.My question -The set I received is the brushed stainless, I'm wondering if the great reviews were for the older set that was 'shiney'?I'd love to hear your comments."
2,"Frying with 10"" skillet","I just purchased a 12 piece set of multi clad pro and decided to test the 10"" skillet out on frying an egg.I let the pan get hot on a medium heat on a gas stove.I tested the heat by put a drop of water in and watched it dance.Than I put about a tbsp on canola oil in the pan and moved the oil over the whole surface including up the sides The egg fried OK so I was sort of satisfied.The big squawk I have is cleaning the pan.I wiped the oil out but the big problem is the brown sticky residue that was left.I put warm water and dish detergent in it and let it soak.I than used a blue scotch brite pad to try to remove the residue but it is still there.I am not willing to spend an hour of more to clean a frying pan.With my cast iron pans I just wipe it out than put some water in the pan and bring it to a slow boil run a brush around it to knock of any residue pour to water out and dry with a paper towel.What I need is some advice in cleaning the multi clad or they will be going back."
5,Outstanding cookware,"Love these. Well made, Solid, heat very evenly with no hot spots and seem to distribute heat well away from the burner when I have to use them on an undersized one on my electric cooktop. They make cooking on electric tolerable. Clean up well. I once added eggwhites to a too hot pan ( I hadn't adjusted to the lower heat required) and burned a layer with no oil or butter and it came off easily with bar keepers friend. Great pans."
5,Love love love these pans.,I am 42 and have always had teflon pans. I was starting to pieces of teflon in my food and decided it was time to get a new set. I was scared at first to go with stainless steel. But I decided to try these out and wish I would have bought these pans years ago. You must purchase Bar Keepers Friend (cost a couple bucks at walmart) and they come clean in an instant even if food is crusted on them. They have been used so many times already and still look like they did when I took them out of the box. I would give them 10 stars if I could. Cooks great and my food does not stick and clean up is a breeze. They say you can put them in a dishwasher but I just sprinkle bar keepers on them and wipe them clean in an instant. Love love love my new pans.....
4,"""African Sculpture speaks"" ... to its readers","Very interesting. Information presented in a very organized way. An excelent way to get aquainted with the subject of African Sculpture. The ony flaw is that the book was published in this late edition in 1975 and so much work has been done sence then in the study of African Art that it does have some blank spots, but over all this is a good start and one of the best general works and texts that I have seen. Images are black and white, but this works to the sculptures advantage so that you can see more of the relief work and shadow. The book is very well organized, topics ranging from mythology and magic to general history and socio-cultural impacts of the west are covered."
5,Complete Blue Horizon Sessions,"I had never heard most of wat is on this album,and was very suprised at how good it is.I took a chance,and Im glad I did.LB"
4,55 Tracks - not 56,"I just purchased this new direct from Amazon and track 16 is missing from disc 3, as mentioned from a previous reviewer. I'll keep it as I just really care about the Christine Perfect tracks anyway, but just be warned that you might encounter this."
3,Christine is perfect but Stan sings like a duck,"I may reduce this cd on my ipod to the tracks that Christine Perfect sings. Stan Webb's voice is as annoying as Chris Farlow's. Sometimes his guitar salvages a track, but then he comes back to sing again. Not enough Christine Perfect to salvage the release, but it sure is good to hear her before her California dreaming became a reality."
1,Harmony Remote SST-748 Software,"O-Stars was not an option.!Cannot remove software through control panel or Harmony uninstall! I have used Registry Mechanic, Defragmented, cleanup disc..you name it I tried it and the windows installer keeps popping up to install the Harmony! Even when I try to open another program. I cannot get this crap off my computer!The remote has been returned, but I am still having grief over the software that was installed for it. I have emailed Logitech 5 times and they don't even reply."
5,one of the finest southern rock collections,"The Allman brothers gold I the definitive collection from this great southern rock band which covers their most succesful years from 1969-79.This terrific compilation was mainly penned from the following albums,THE ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND,IDLEWILD SOUTH,LIVE AT FILLMORE EAST,EAT A PEACH,BROTHERS AND SISTERS,WIN LOSE OR DRAW,WIPE THE WINDOWS,CHECKTHE OIL,DOLLAR AND GAS and 1979's ENLIGHTENED ROGUES.I bought this collection two days back and just cant stop listening to it.Most of their popular songs are featured in this collection and is highly recommended to all rock fans who want their music on a single compilation."
5,The Greatest Collection for the Allman Brothers Band!,"This is an incredibel colleciton from one of the finest bands of all time, and a strong contender for the all time greatest American band. If you want an introduction to the band, get this! This is the only one of their ""best of's"" that does them justice. It has pretty much all of these songs from their first 5 classic albums. (about 25 of 35) and is much less than getting all their albums. (but you still might want to get Fillmore East.When I got my first ABB CD (20th century...) I read a reivew that said ""you WILL get more."" I laughed at it because Jessica and Ramblin Man were all I needed. After listening to it, I had found the reviwer to be right, you will always want more ABB! The 15 dollars to get this CD may be the best 15 dollars that you will ever spend in your life!"
5,closet organizer for dad,"i use my closet organizer to set out matching clothes forour son and daughter for the week. my husband is a stay at home dad,and when he dresses them i just wanted their clothes to match he likes it because he doesnt have search for their clothes."
3,Trucker action,"This is the 1st in a series about ex-Special Forces vigilantes who happen to be truck drivers. And as with most of the action-adventure genre since the debut of Mack Bolan, their 1st adventure pits them against the mob. It's not bad. The truck driving setting gives plenty of opportunity for chases and gun battles. All in all, a not bad debut and I'll probably dip further into the series soon."
5,Breathtaking,"Featuring Euroboy (a.k.a. Knut from Turbonegro), this is one of the best releases on Man's Ruin. Euroboys features lush, orchestrated retro/urban instrumental sounds. This is one of Euroboy's post Turbonegro albums, and he's immersed himself in his own over-the-top guitar mastery, and he's pushed it further with vast, layered compositions and crosses genres into a kind of retro pop sound. It's as far away from punk rock as you can possibly get, but any punk rocker who grew to love ""Apocalypse Dudes"" by Turbonegro is probably ready for this album. It's almost like a soundtrack to some long lost spaghetti western or spy movie. Tunes like ""In Farfizium,"" ""Sex Kabin"" and ""Transatlantic Phonecall"" are atmospheric gems, and only get better with close, attentive listening. One of the rare vocal tracks, ""Filadelfia"" is a brilliant, catchy number that you will have in your head all day."
4,Valet stand,This valet stand is really nice and useful. My husband always likes to set out his outfit the night before work and this really comes in handy. These are not very easy to find in stores so I really was pleased to see it on Amazon.
2,Berry Has Much Better Poems,"Wendell Berry is one of my favorite poets; I highly recommend 'Entries', 'The Timbered Choir, and his various collected and selected poems to anyone interested in language that is alive and powerful in evocatively imagistic and spiritual ways. But 'Given' left me a bit cold. These poems would be better suited to Berry's excellent agrarian commentary work; but as poetry they failed the genre a bit, coming off like bland polemics in a language all too flat. The work is not without some merit, but I would certainly give Berry's other collections a much higher priority."
3,Monotone,"Lessons move very slowly, and are quite difficult to listen to. The speaker has a very monotone voice and there does not seem to be much emphasis on phrases, yet it is easy to follow and understand."
5,Fraggle Rock Rocks!,"These plush dolls are so cute, I am very pleased with this classic item...I wish they had the whole clan...""Dance your cares away!"""
5,Fraggle Rock Red Doll,Fraggle Rock dolls are the greatest because Fraggle Rock was the best TV show. They always take off the best.
5,this thing is tight,i love this chair its the best thing in the whole world<br />i love it if any one takes this chair i will be really mad <br />its so soft i fell asleep on it and the next morning i couldnt even move
5,Fishman PRO-EQ Platinum Bass Preamp,"I was really satisfied with product. Item was better than I thought it would be. Would recommend to anyone interested in a preamp , this item is a good choice."
1,Not all that..,"I bought this for upright bass. I liked the features, and really wanted to like the sound, but it just didn't have the drive or tone that my Tech21 Bass Driver has, which is what I ended up using. Now, before you jump to the ""well, you weren't using it right"" conclusion, I really did try several configurations, i.e. direct into a power amp, throught the front end of my GK bass amp, into a mixer, etc., and still came up with the same conclusion, it was weak."
5,A must have in your home,Received the DVDs timely and the package was good. Original DVDs. A must have in home. We watch them over and over again regularly.
2,not at all what i expected,"I picked this up because the cover looked cool and i expected it to be full of fun, hip stories, but it wasn't like that at all. I am a fan of authors like sophie kinsella and love books like the nanny diaries and the devil wears prada. But if you like books like that this is not for you. All these stories are about looserish people with bizarre problems and none of them are very funny. If your looking for a fun summer read this book is not worth your time."
2,.,"This was a problem of high expectations. I thought it would be great and it wasn't even good.If you want some time killer short stories, it isn't bad."
1,Thought I Bought Big Print,"I ordered a western book for my 86 year old father-in-law who is having vision problems and would like read again. We wanted to buy him a western that is printed in Big Print Type Face about 14 or bigger type face. So we went to the vendor that said they had this book in a large size type. Well, I was sadly disappointed when we not only received the book and it was NOT large print and in fact it was a library book and too small a print face for my father-in-law to read. The total cost was about $4.95 including shipping, so I guess I should have been alerted to the low price and what that might mean. I am disappointed that we did not get a western book that is large print. I think that Amazon's search engine sent me to the wrong resource."
2,spacemaker coffee maker,"first of all.....cannot pour coffee from the carafe, without it leaking all over the place..problem still exists if you remove the lid. Previous models had a large illuminated clock face where you could read system status. This unit has small and dark panel and is hard to read. In summation, the older models were superior."
2,Irritating Machine,"we dealt with the spillage while trying to pour a cup, we even learned not to use the ""sneak a cup"" feature as it only backs up on top of the lid when returning the carafe and we only thought we could deal with the leakage from the water tank, but we can't anymore because the little part on the bottom of the tank is broken and we can't find a replacement for this part so we're going to have to buy a whole new machine, hopefully after super glueing the piece back on it will hold until i can get to the store..."
2,Leaks Water,"At first I really liked the ODC-400 except for the pot, which already has enough complaints. It does keep it hot for a reasonably long time though. It's 5 years old, and the water tank has been through hell. I bought a new one in hopes that my leaking water issue would be resolved, but it must be leaking water from where the tank meets the internal gasket. Naturally there are no replacement gaskets, or I'd change it out -- if possible. My 22 oz. mug fits nicely under the brew basket, so that's what I usually do."
1,This is the worst coffee pot I have ever purchased.,"I am on my 3rd one, exchanged or returned all the others. They have all had issues with not brewing, stopping in the middle, and leaking water from the tank.Even if they didn't have these problems, its difficult to pour the coffee without spilling it all over.Horrible. Horrible Horrible."
1,very dangerous also,"The coffee basket keeps popping out while brewing and therefor the coffee is not able to drip into the glass pot and it over flows from the basket onto the counter and our wood floor!!!!!! The basket also has a metal front and gets very, very hot. We are taking our pot back to the store for a full refund! Very disapointed as we sold our home with our old B&D undercount pot that we loved and had for 9 years!"
1,Waste of money,"Coffee drips into the cold ""thermos"" as it is brewing. The pot heats up to almost hot but there is no burner so the coffee never gets very hot and cools off rapidly. It's very difficult to pour and hard to get the top back on straight. Don't even think about buying this one."
1,Leaking pot,"This is the worst B&D product I have ever bought.Pot leaks when u try to pour,comes out in a trickle.Reservoir is hard to hold(no handle)sometimes it leaks while brewing.Poorly designed product"
2,drippy caraffe,Its too bad the only spacemaker available is tarnished by a badly designed caraffe. Everything else is good except when you go to pour your coffee it only comes out at a trickle pace or it spills down the side.
2,Terrible coffee maker,"As everyone has said on this list, the pot on this coffee maker ruins the whole thing. Otherwise, decent machine. We had no choice but to buy this type of coffee maker because it's for our office and there's no counter space in the kitchenette. I read the reviews, hoped for the best and got exactly what everyone else said. Impossible to pour this without it dribbling out all over the place. Ridiculous design. Too bad, because it overshadows an otherwise efficient machine."
3,Decent,"I picked this up from my local electronics store (because I didn't want to wait for shipping). 30ft spool covered my center channel and bi-amp'ed mains, and 50 ft easily wired my surrounds. Never hurts to get extra, too.Pros:-It's very reasonably priced, for ""name-brand"" cables.-It's ""THX"" certified (not sure that it really matters for speaker wire?!)-I was able to tell the difference between ""red"" and ""black"" (the labeling is consistently on only one wire).Cons:-It was surprisingly tough for me to strip & crimp the wires (tip: try setting strippers for 14ga. wires)-It's not very easy to tell ""red wire"" vs ""black wire""-It probably costs extra for the THX nameNeutral:-The wires claim to be directional (I realized after I ""mis-routed"" one surround) - but they're wires. They work whatever way you tell them to.All that being said, they are just regular, generic speaker wires. Not the fanciest, but nothing really bad about them, either."
4,Affordable Monster!,These look very good quality for the price. It's Monster after all! I was using Sony supplied thinner wires (must be more than 20 gauge!) for about two weeks before these arrived. Sound quality didn't improved so dramatically - may be I don't have an audiophile ear or may be my Sonys are not that good of the speakers. But still I am very very happy with the purchase. These wires are much thicker and looks cool!One thing though: these wires are half copper and half aluminum (or silver?) coated.
3,an Englishman in India,"This is an historical novel about an Englishman in India during a civil war in the 17th century. He becomes involved in the war and, of course, involved with women. Not a bad read."
5,Superb,For a 1930's movie I was very impressed. They just don't make them like they used to. My 6 yr old loved it and wants the rest of the Tarzan movies. It was quite graphic for the era. Good action for kids
2,Too light for me and no SPF protection,"I have dry, sensitive skin, so this one is too light for me... doesn't even touch the problem.Plus, please be aware that this lotion has NO SPF protection at all."
4,Healthy Thirst Quencher,"I first saw this product in a Harry and David's store and since I like pears, I bought it. It has a nice fresh pleasant taste which makes for a good thirst quencher. I enjoyed it. If you have the money, it(and the other real fruit Izze's} would be a good replacement for your kids who have a pop or soda habit. If you like pears, give it a try."
2,Nice Attempt With Pears,I gave this drink to my best friend and she said it was nasty. I usually trust her judgement. She didn't have anything nice to say about this product.
3,Decent system for around $400,"This appears to be the same system Wal-Mart is currently selling for $394 (as of April 2006). It's a decent system, but like all the other Sony home theatre systems, the CD/DVD player is painfully s-l-o-w! Maybe Sony will fix this issue in next year's models?"
1,How NOT to record a live album,"1.-I'm a L7 fan. Let's make that clear2.-It's a shame such great songs are featured with such poor, terrible sound. Imagine going to a Rock show with the flu, seeing the band in the back of a low-budget club. This is it3.-Some reviewer wrote ""I have heard worse ones"". Yeah, me too, but they were not OFFICIAL releases!!! ANY BOOTLEG nowadays sounds light years better!4.-Such cool intro with the marching band...again, down the drain it goes5.-Great poster designer Frank Kozik did the design for this one... And he did not do very well either! The photoshop tricking is obvious on the cover6.-L7 RULES...BUT NOT LIKE THIS!!"
4,Where's 'Pretend your Dead',"'So what's there to do in Ohmaha?''Nothing? OK a whole lot of nothing!'So goes some of the banter on L7's live show in both Omaha and Osaka. I love L7, and really love them live (I've seen them three times), but the fans deserved better than this.I love Live, raw rock at it's finest and you can tell there was no over-dubbing in the studio, but the recording is so amateur. You would swear someone was taping this in the crowd with a tape recorder ala 80's style.The song set is great, but L7 always ends their show with 'Pretend we're Dead', which isn't here. I thought also they might sneak in 'I would walk 5000 miles, and I would walk 5000 more'. They do that song as a joke for every show I've seen them at.Oh well, it's L7 and if you're a fan, you just gotta have it. Rock on."
3,Let's rock tonight!,"Since I continue to wait for a ""Best Of"" disc from L7, I thought I'd take a gamble on this live album. I found the performances to be fairly good, while the sound of the disc is not. After the marching band medley to start, which is unique and interesting, we get ten tracks live in Omaha, and the remainder from Osaka. Also this is obviously part of the ""Beauty Process"" tour, as half the tracklist is from that album. I won't complain about missing songs, since this is actually a decent mix. I can safely say this is for the bigger L7 fans out there, and newbies should just stick with ""Hungry For Stink"" or ""Bricks Are Heavy"". Still, if it sounds good go for it. It's cheap used."
4,Curious if George really tumbles?,"Yes, my sister said it really does! I sent it as a present for my niece's 4th birthday not knowing if it was good or not. My niece loves Curious George, so I thought she would love it no matter what. She actually brought it to pre-school and the children loved it!"
3,be a good little monkey,"George is an old favorite, this one needs no batteries, his head is weighted so he tumbles when you sit him up, he's soft and cuddly and my grandson loves to watch George with George!"
3,Poor CD reproduction,"This is a splendid version of Boris Godunov. Its main advantage is a splendid sound: splendid voices, splendid orchestra and splendid recording. The 2003 CD version reproduces this splendor, but with a slightly mushy sound. This more recent CD version kills all this! The sound is neater, but over exposed. The orchestra is so far away it cannot be heard correctly, the texture is dry and thinned... nearly ugly. What a pity! The voices have lost their thickness."
5,Blue paint scheme is awesome,"This is the same figure as the first prime but with the dark blue paint scheme. This figure looks much better than the first prime. The first prime although original, the red, white, and silver paint just didn't look that good and the legs look very bulky. A week before the movie came out in the theaters I saw 30+ primes at Toys R Us and Target, of course they were all sold out during next few days. I didnt buy it because it just didnt look that good.Then I saw this few days ago at Target and it looks really good so I got it. It's well built and huge.By the way I saw the masterpiece version of Megatron at a toy store(Bandai Japanese version, I dont think it's released in USA due to the GUN design issue. It's huge and made of all plastic like this prime and the shop wanted $150 which is rip. If they release here for $40 I would get it."
1,Generation EX: Adult Children of Divorce and the Healing of our Pain,"Horrible! The book was obviously written by a women who had a major axe to grind and she needs some professional therapy. I felt sorry for her as I listened to the book. She lumped all divorced people into the same category, and made insulting generalities about parents who divorce. I divorced, but I did so to protect my children from their father's abuse (that I did not know was going on). I very much resented being talked about in her book, like I was selfish for divorcing.I threw the book away. I would have loved to have passed it on to others who had adult children of divorce who were struggling, but I honestly thought that the book would do damage, so I threw it away!I would not recommend for anyone to read it. If your adult kids are messed up from your divorce, this book will only mess them up farther."
3,Campy,A look at what passed for action adventure back in tbs 60s. Fun to watch because its so corny and full of stereotypes.
4,GREAT WATCH!,A few bad words but great tense story. Will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time!!
4,An interesting look at the escape of an entire war prison,"Frank Sinatra is the American who, with two other Americans, an italian guard,an English solider and a priest, plots the escape of an entire prison camp after the Italians break off alliance with Germany during WWII. By train they try to sneak into neutral territory with the help of the Italian soldier who once was in charge of the prison camp. Big highlight is when Sinatra, as spokesperson for the camp, demands better conditions and when he doesn't receive them he orders the prisoners to strip and burn their clothes to which a partially-dressed Edward Mulhare(the priest) comments, "" Sir, I take being a member of the cloth, literally."""
4,Von Ryan's Express,This movie is referenced in the movie 'The Godfather'when Vito Corleone gets the war movie staring role forfor Johnny Fontane A.K.A. Frank Sinatra.There is plenty of action with the most believeableperformance comming from British pow Trevor Howard.Sinatra's performance as the title sugests is self serving.The reference given in the Godfather says it all.
4,Interesting WWII yarn,"The movie is good time pass, there are numerous movies that exploit WWII and this is ok, one of the better. It lacks emotional intensity of Great Escape or the thrill of Burt Lancaster's Train, Sinatra looks silly and many scenes including the escape on the train are downright stagey. Still there is some humor and Trevor Howard does a neat job. Worth watching once."
3,Frankie,"It has been said of Sinatra, not a nice person off screen but on screen, always dependable and in charge of the situation. He even outshadowed the venerable Trevor Howard in this one. As a drama, very good and as a war movie, good again. Interesting locations like the old ruins. Back to Sinatra, seen many movies with him and never a bad one."
1,Read the book. See how miscast Sinatra was!,"This is a terrible movie version of a pretty exciting book. Frank Sinatra was and never could be Joseph Ryan. He was totally miscast in this role. I have a feeling he was a producer who acquired the rights for himself thinking that he could play the part. So wherever you are, Frankie, it didn't work!"
2,"With German soldiers this dumb, Hitler never had a chance.","""Von Ryan's Express"" has about as much credibility and subtlety as an average ""Hogan's Heroes"" episode but sadly without the humor.The story of a group of POWs in wartime Italy attempting to escape for freedom via train is told in heavy-handed, obvious - not to mention juvenile - fashion. With German soldiers this dumb, Hitler never had a chance.Sinatra and Trevor Howard are actually quite good but are surrounded by second-rate acting talent. With believability jettisoned early on, this ""boys own"" adventure becomes downright tedious.Sound and picture quality on this DVD are excellent. Unfortunately this tends to highlight the extensive use of obvious rear-projection shots."
1,Skippin' video,"It appears that the DVD is damaged since it locks up and/or skips portions of the movie in several places. I put my DVDs in jewel cases and I threw away the DVD case; if I hadn't, I would have returned this product."
4,Von Ryan's Express 1965,"As the allies begin to push the nazi back toward Germany , U.S Combat pilot Col. Joseph Ryan ( Frank Sinatra 1915-1998 ) is shot down and placed in a prison camp . Initialy , he's more concerned with surviving than escaping , carning him the isulting nick name *Von Ryan* , But in time , Ryan takes over from the commanding British officer ( Trevor Howard 1918-1988) and masterminds a daredevil race for freedom that involves commandeering a train and getting it across Italy to Switzerland with the nazi in hot pursuit . Then it's a blazing action , hairraising chase and spetacular Italian scenary in this oscar nominated adventure that runs full speed until the nail-bitting finale . High Quality Transfer ."
5,Classic Sinatra and Trevor Howard,"One of my fav films . I bought this on VHS years ago for my now late father. He loved it and I enjoyed it so much I also bought a copy .Being from NJ many people knew Mr .Sinatra ( my ex father in law grew up with him ) his works are without compare .I bought this again as it reminds me of the times dad and I would set and watch old sci fi films , Abbott and Costello and of course Mr Sinatra .Tevor Howard is a fine English actor and has much to his credit , I do feel Edward Mulhare stole the show as he impersonated an arrogant German officer .If you like something thats actually light , yes a war movie , and enjoy rooting for the good guys this film is it!we baby boomers must have good taste as my nephew has asked to borrow Von Ryans ....."
5,"Classic Quad Set 12 (Desert Rats, 12 O'Clock High, Von Ryan's Express, The Young Lions)","Four really outstanding World War 2 movies. This set is worth every penny and more, buying them all individually would cost 4x as much. The DVDS are all top grade and the movies are totally remastered. Where else can you get 4 great movies together with so many great actors in them at such a low price."
4,Von Ryan's Express,"I saw the movie a number of years ago and liked it. Wanted a copy for my ""library"". This is good WWII action film."
5,A coffee-lover's favorite,"I will take coffee over tea any day, but I do have a short list of teas I like. This tea came in a sampler pack and I have not been able to find it in stores. My favorites were always Darjeeling and Earl Grey. But, now Prince of Wales tops my list. I agree with the other reviewer that a pastry or Pepperidge Farms Bordeaux cookie doesn't hurt as an accompaniment!"
4,Change of pace,"Im actually drinking it now. My favs are Lady Grey, Mixed berry, and Peach. Its Twinnings, its a bargain, when you get the 6 pack. I buy enough to get free shipping and Im good for a few months. I do 4 ""cuppa's"" a day."
1,Buyer Beware,The description may say one size fits most but this hat was giant! Not even with the velcro strap does it fit an average adult's head. Now I have to pay a ridiculous amout to return it. Not a happy customer....
4,not for women,"This hat is a quality hat, but it is not really for women. It is fairly large and looks more like a square baseball cap."
2,Look Great....Not so Great on Quality,"I've always been impressed with the look of Kenneth Cole dress shoes, but not so impressed with the quality. This is the second pair that i've purchased in recent years and it's also the second pair that i've returned. Steer clear."
3,Typical B3 Jazz of the era,"It's not spectacular, but it's solid. The flutes on tracks 2 and 3 really pin this release down to the 60's era, and aren't my thing. There are a few swinging numbers on here though, especially track 1. The last track is a really good blues piece."
1,Worst book ever DO NOT USE-does not help,This book does not cover much of what is on the test. I was so upset and very dissapointed I studied this book over and over and I passed the practice exam at the end of the book. I went to take the test and the questions that were asked were not covered in the book. The last two chapeters are not even on the exam. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! Now I have to stay an extra semster!!! Please do not buy this book. Just looked at the title page and it has not been updated since 1991!!! This book is neither credible or reliable. The people at Comex systems should be charged for fraud!!
1,Minimal CLEP Help,"I failed the CLEP using this book. There was way too much information missing. Topics on Employment Law and Environmental Law were not even covered. I studied from Barron's Business Law before taking the test again, and passed. Barron's provides very useful examples and YOU SHOULD REMEMBER boxes that are very applicable to the test. You need to study more for this CLEP then the others. This was the hardest CLEP I have taken. Good Luck"
2,"Okay book, but you will need the Barron's Review as well","The book is very simple and has okay examples and a fair practice test. The material covered is not very deep, and it is probably barely enough by itself to pass the test. I read this book, did the test and I also read the Barron Review (the relevant parts), and got a 68."
1,Useless book,"This title covers only a feeble percentage of the material you need to know to pass the clep exam. If you rely on this book alone, you will fail. It is a waste of money."
1,Don't buy,"This review guide is horrible. I knew the content inside and out and still didn't pass. It is either out-of-date or not researched. Either way, don't buy it."
4,worth the extra bucks,This portfolio is sturdy and well-designed. The slots for the quarters are tight so you dont have piles of change when you set it down. Nice descriptions of each state next to slot. Well worth the few dollars extra.
4,bto gold cd review,This is a great collection of songs. So much better than that short 20th century cd. But it is missing a few tracks though. They should have included somes songs from street actions and a few more songs form rock n roll night. But other than that small complaint this is a great collection of songs and I recommend you buy this cd if you don't have it yet .
3,Bachman-Turner Overdrive: Gold,"This seems to be fine, but there has been some blues playing in that album with Randy Bachman, his brother Rob Bachman, C.F. Turner, and others. I like some of the songs just fine no doubt about it."
3,Contains all the essential tunes plus filler,"This collection contains the essential BTO and then some. It does not insult this band's legacy to claim that this generous 35 song collection, including instrumental pieces, easily brings together all the highlights of this band's accomplishments. However, there is a lot of excess fat here that could have easily been trimmed to make this a superior, more cohesive representation of this band's riff-heavy, hook-laden brand of boogie-woogie rock. What makes this not an easily recommended, no-brainer purchase is that the 2nd CD is loaded with filler. It's well-executed filler, but, this compilation shows that BTO endured by recycling riffs and melodies of their brighter past.I don't regret my purchase, but the impact of this band can be captured more effectively by a far slimmer package of their tunes. There is a lot to enjoy for those who like BTO's style and punch, but there is nearly as much filler as well."
3,Good Compilation Poor Remastering,"This isn't a bad compilation but the remastering is poor, I have a lot of other remastered cd's of music from the same era and the remastering is far superior. Doesn't any other BTO fans think that it's time BTO2, Not Fragile & 4wd deserve to be remastered as full albums, Not Fragile could be done as a Hybrid SACD as they have the Quadraphonic mix which has been released as a DTS CD.BTO were a big band in there day worldwide and a lot of bands who only sold half of what BTO have sold have had their back catalogue remastered."
4,A plain-old good western,"Kirk Douglas stars as a taciturn marshall who must bring a highly lynchable cattle rustler (and accused murderer) to trial, fending off the mob that dogs their trail through the desert, as tensions mount on all sides. A nice western that drags a little, but is basically pretty enjoyable. Virginia Mayo is dishy as the tough, tom-girlish love interest. Raoul Walsh directed, and the B&W cinematography is pretty good."
4,"The mullet deserves 4 stars, no, I'm not kidding!","This is one of those movies that you look forward to to take a break from the world. You expect to just sit back and relax. While it's not a gut-buster from start-to-finish, you're completely unaware of this because the storyline slyly keeps you entertained. David Spade's not winning any Comedian of the Year awards, but he is actually funnier than expected. The originality of his character, Joe Dirté, along with the unusually well-written script makes for a movie which leaves you with more than just a gut-full of $8 popcorn. Somewhere near the end of the movie, I thought to myself, ""Self, what's going on here? Has this movie just made you feel something?? That can't be right."" Believe it. All-in-all you leave feeling you haven't just wasted your hard-earned money on cheap laugh-therapy, but invested in a respectable movie that runs away with Sweetest Haircut and Most Shockingly Entertaining awards."
4,Christopher Walken Plays Clem,"GUILTY PLEASURE TIME!!! I love ""Joe Dirt""! David Spade has captured perfectly the white-trash aesthetic here. The clothes, the trailer-parks, the music. ""Van Halen, not Van Hagar!"" We are completely in sympathy with this mullet-headed poor excuse for a redneck as he seeks out his white-trash parents who abandoned him at the Grand Canyon. I have known Joe Dirts in my life(truth be told I'm related to some), and David Spade is him. Good supporting turn by Dennis MIller as a radio talk-show host who uses Joe's poignant story for his audience's personal amusement. And Christopher Walken plays Clem."
4,Mullets R Us,"Okay some people like ""Dumb and Dumber"" and I use to wonder why. Well they are certainly entitled to their opinion. After laughing so hard at this movie I have to admit I see their point too. Let's face it their are some movies that may not have great acting or even much of a new storyline but they are just plain funny. Any fans of movies like ""A Night at the Roxbury"", ""The Waterboy"", and ""Deuce Bigolow, Male Gigolo"" should find this funny. Certainly fans of Saturday Night Live should like it. I have seen men, women, kids, and even grandparents laugh at this one. Considering they made a TV series based on this type person, it must have had something people liked. At least rent it, I don't think you will be disappointed."
1,One Lame Joke after Another,"I often wuestion why so many people like certain movies, and this is one of them. Joe Dirt is a lame movie that pokes fun at the redneck stereotype from every possible angle and still screws it up.The idea is that Joe Dirt (David Spade) is telling his life story to shock DJ Xander (Dennis Miller). He tells of how his parents abandoned him at the Grand Canyon and his journey to find them. However instead a funny touching movie you just get one lame joke after another until the cruelty of it all finally ends.Don't waste your time, you can find better things to do with an hour and a half."
1,Poor Movie.,One of the worst films in the world. It is a waste of time and is NOT funny!Rating: PG-13 for Language and Violence
2,"Now, 'That's' Entertainment....",....anything with Dennis Miller in it can't be all bad. This moovy also plays on the notion that endless Def Leppard concertsand roaring down the dirt roads in a hemi-hyped Dodge/Plymouth ala the Dukes is someone's idea of heaven....and is clever enuff to satirize it.
3,"Also, better than I thought.","This movie was recommended to me by my boss, and I admit to being skeptical at first. (I'm not a big fan of sophmoric humor in general). =-)However, despite the rather blatant 'sophmoric' bits, and obligatory potty humor, I found myself engrossed and amused despite myself.Joe is such an endearing character, that to see him triumph over his tormentors was quite satisfying. I would recommend this for anyone who likes tongue and cheek humor, and can ignore the sophmoric bits."
1,"Same Old, Same Old","You could easily insert Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, Chris Farley, Chris Kattan or any other ... SNL actor in this movie because all of their damn movies have the same damn plot! Loser meets girl, falls in love, does something stupid to make you think he lost her, finally gets her back in the end. Sprinkle a few chuckles here and there and bam! You,ve got another ..., predictable movie."
3,the forrest gump of smut ridden comedies,"this movie has a lot of crude humor.by ctude i mean whole parts centered around a dogs private parts and raw sewage on a persons body.yep,pretty nasty.no need for this i say.well,joe is searching for his parents and ends up on a talk show.he goes through his entire wild story starting with being abandoned at the grand canyon as a child and goes on up to the present day.that one loser from a talk show on hbo is the talk show host.he sucks!kid rock plays a redneck who messes with joe all the time.the material here is not suitable for the underage types.it is a good movie all in all and can be enjoyed by most.there is one sexy chick named brandy in it but.........yup ya guessed it,she keeps her shirt on.theres this other skank too.so,its good is the point if you can handle a few nasty parts."
5,Is this where you wanna be when Jesus comes back?,"Joe Dirt is the delightful comedy about a boy with a mullit wig surgically implanted in his head. He gets lost at the Grand Canyon when he was 8 and his heroic Journey to find his parents. I recomend this movie to everyone and the following is a quote from Joe Dirt himself:""When I was little i was sittin' in my room jerkn' my gerkn' and my mother came in saw me and said is this were you wanna be when Jesus comes back Jerkn' your Gerkn'"" -Joe dirt"
5,joe dirt rules,Never mind the dumbass critics. This movie is hilarious from start to finish. I liked it allot but not as much as Dickie Roberts.
2,quite boring,"I expected this to be a good movie because brittany daniel(one on my fave actress's) was in it. But it wasn't. This movie is one of those boring outback country types. I was really disappointed by the story structure because it didn't entertain me. Those who don't like country outback movies, be careful not to rent this one."
3,Another Average Comedy from executive Producer Adam Sandler,"SNL Alumn David Spade stars in this Forrest Gump spoof produced by Robert Simonds. Joe Dirt (David Spade) is a redneck janitor cleaning a radio station, when he is found LA Radio personality Zander Kelly (Dennis Miller) and put on Zander's show. Joe tells his life story to listeners which consists of, working at a number of terrible jobs, findng a belived comet, but later finds out it is made out of feces, making out with who he later suspects is his sister, falling in love with a girl (Brittney Daniel) and her dog, and most importantly trying to find his parents who he lost at the Grand Canyon when he was young. The movie is okay but it lacks the laughs that other Robert Simonds productions had like, Billy Madison, or Dirty Work. It also stars Kid Rock, and Malcom n the middle's Erik Per Sullivan."
1,"Yeah, um, David Spade HIMSELF walked out of it","When I heard that David Spade walked out of his own movie, I just thought to myself ""FORGET SEEING THAT ONE!"" Well, later that month my teacher brought in a movie for us to watch, RAVING how funny it was and what do ya know...JOE DIRT. Since I had nothing to do, I decided to actually watch it. BELIEVE ME, ""Joe Dirt"" is as stupid as stupid can get. See it if you want, but I would NEVER watch it AGAIN. I don't know why David Spade wasted his time..."
4,"Fun, simple, entertaining.","Okay, so Joe Dirt won't win any awards...it is still a fun movie. I enjoy the format....Dennis Miller is the radio host that walks us through the life of Joe Dirt, left by parents at the grand canyon, setting Joe on a life long journey to find his parents, never wanting to believe they left him on purpose. I am a big fan of Dennis. This movie highlights the finer points of redneck living in a light hearted humorous manner. Kid Rock is in it...you can tell it is NOT a far reach for him to display the white trash side of life, complete with early '80's Trans Am!! Christopher Walken has a fun part in the movie as well...a big fan of Walken too!While Tommy Boy was a better movie, this one is still a good one and I would recommend you give it a shot....especially if you can find it under $5 including shipping!"
3,sound quality was low,"movie was good with no skips but the sound quality was up and down. ""Loud at one point and quite at another"""
4,Ignore the critics...IT'S A FUNNY MOVIE!,"""Joe Dirt"" are some of those films you are really supposed to dislike: it's crude, has more stupid and immature jokes a viewer can take, and the title...well...it's original.Yes, when the film came out in the spring of 2001, the film received scathing reviews and dissapointing box-office numbers. But it seems to have an interesting cult following. It's not just the rednecks who like the film, but just viewers who just want to have a good time, ignore all the stupid critics, and have a laugh. It's a guilty pleasure spectacle! The film is so stupid, it's funny! The story has heart, a fine cast including the lovable David Spade, the always akward, but hilarious Christopher Walken, and fine quick-paced editing that keeps the viewer in tune.All in all, it's a hillbillie masterpiece! Just get the film, it's more worthy then any Farrelly Brothers flick."
3,IT MADE ME LAUGH,"Movies like JOE DIRT can't be evaluated for script or quality values. It's a raucous, sometimes unfunny, but always entertaining movie that has enough laughs to keep you with it. David Spade mugs through the role with his usual agressive, though somewhat contained, bluster. The movie's cast consists of such stalwarts as Joe Don Baker, Rosanna Arquette, Brian Thompson (in his brief unveiling as Buffalo Bob), Adam Beach, Kathleen Freeman, Fred Ward, Dennis Miller and so on. The meteor joke is priceless and Kid Rock's attempt at acting as Robbie is also a good joke.All in all, this isn't a classic comedy but it made me laugh."
3,Funny But Not Funny Enough,"This movie if funny, don't get me wrong, but as far as I'm concerned, it's mere comedic trash. I would suggest not to see it even though it has it's funny parts here and there."
4,Worthwhile Comedy,"This is the story of a guy named Joe Dirt, who while working as janitor at a radio station is pulled onto the show to be the butt of the host's (Dennis Miller) jokes. But once he is on the show and begins to tell his story, they find more than just a hilariously pitiful redneck with a hideous wig grafted to his head. Joe Dirt is a guy that has had every kind of misfortune, including losing his parents on a vacation at the Grand Canyon, and has still kept his head and his hopes up. Without the comedy the story might be a little lame, and without the story there wouldn't be enough jokes to fill a feature film, but together they make a great movie. I don't usually like ""mindless comedies"", but for some reason I loved this one. Maybe it was because Joe Dirt is such an up-beat, lovable character. You should definitley give this one a try."
2,Remember how much of a waste Magnolia was?,"Within the first two minutes you will know that you have just committed yourself to an hour and a half of pure [less than admirable viewing]. Okay, that's a bit harsh, but this is not a good movie. I gave it 2 stars because giving it just 1 would have looked like I didn't take the care to actually think about my rating. It is best described as a smokey-frat-house attempt at ""Forest Gump for Dummies."" While the movie has a few rollickingly funny moments (akin to the South Park movie), it is overall troubled. Good cameos by Kid Rock (not a good actor, thankfully) and Dennis Miller. ..."
1,Horrible,Zero stars really. Usually a film has SOMETHING to offer. This movie is beyond awful. Can't believe it was made. DO NOT BUY!
1,"BAD! Waste of talent- Denis Miller, Christopher Walken, etc","In short, this movie stinks. I mean it smells B-A-D! I like many of the actors in it, but the humor is just so predictable or at times disgusting. I couldn't wait for the movie to end, but found the ending like the entire story, unbelievable and uninspiring, not what good comedies are supposed to be about. The movie ARTHUR, for instance, has unrefined humor (person getting drunk in public, etc.), but you believe in the characters and aren't just watching actors portraying exaggerated personalities going through the motions for a one-liner joke or to be gross out the audience. Even the scene with the dog being frozen to the porch was unnecessary and unfunny, like this movie in general. Sorry JOE DIRT, you're a mess!"
1,Joe Dirt,I would give this no stars if possible. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. David Spade proves not only that he was the least talented cast member while on Saturday Night Live but also that he can't make a funny movie without someone to carry him (Chris Farley). Save your money. Not funny at all; I could barely sit through it.
4,'Joe Dirt' (Sony) Running time: 90 minutes,"# 123. Quite entertaining 2001 comedy that finds janitor / low-life / redneck wanna-be Joe Dirt (David Spade) in search of his long lost family that he hasn't seen since he was eight years old. Radio host Zander Kelly (Dennis Miller) takes a special interest in Dirt's story - as he tells it on 'air' over the course of several days. Dirt's gal pal, the sexy country girl of a small community Silvertown, Brandy (Brittany Daniel) seems to find that 'something appealing' about this society reject. Upside is that Joe Dirt turns out to be a geniune nice guy, yet many still think low and laugh at him. A humorous scene: when Buffalo Bob (Brian Thompson) keeps Dirt hostage in a 'Silence Of The Lamb' spoof. Not sure how this film did in the theaters, but it's still fun to watch on the TV."
3,Three Stars Is Really Good In My Book,"Okay...this is one of those dirty secrets that one tends to keep hidden away...I really liked this film. If you understand what it is...a silly lark that is not to be taken seriously at all!...That is, it is a film where you do not expect to think...nor even WANT to think at all!If you grew up in the late 70's to late 80's you knew guys like this...you may even know a few now!...""Van Halen man...not Van HAGAR!!!"" You knew guys like Robbie, ""Def Leppard SUCKS!!!"" You wanted girls like Jill, ""A Hemi?"" and you wanted a HEMI!!!After seeing this you can go back to claiming how much you are into foreign films that have such deep meanings you never figure them out...but for now...LIFE'S A GARDEN...DIG IT!!!"
1,The worst movie ever made,"Quite simply, this is the worst movie I have ever seen. Horrible acting, even worse writing and no story. Throw in Dennis Miller at his absolute worst and you have the ulitimate bomb."
2,"Life's a garden, dig it!","I don't belive this was ever an SNL sketch, but it wouldn't surprise me.It wasn't bad, so much as it wasn't too terribly good."
2,HUH?,"Did I read someone say that Rosanna Arquette had an astounding performance? Now it seems that Bradley Tobin was watching a completely different movie, because in the Joe dirt I saw, Rosanna Arquette didnt do much of a job at all, BECAUSE SHE ISN'T IN THE MOVIE!!! This movie was pretty bad, nad isn't even worth the 2 stars I gave it!"
4,Tristan,"Tristan is the perfect hero: intelligent, courageous, and incredibly handsome. But only one women, Isolde, is equally strong enough for him. The way that their lives amazingly fold to one another keeps the pace of the novel. I can't honestly say it is the greatest love story, but you will find a variety of excitement, including love. Plus, add in kings, queens, dragons, pirates, thieves, potions, jeously, passion, loyalty, revenge, and deception, you have an action-packed book. I couldn't stop reading the adventures."
5,Beautiful,"This book is about the important things in life: family, finding love, discovering the importance of heritage. House writes about a very particular place but manages to make it universal. The writing is often like great poetry. The characters are unforgettable. Our book club read it and this is the only book out of our three-year existence that we have all agreed on. And we all loved it. If you liked Big Stone Gap but like a more literary prose, this is the book for you."
2,"Wonderful sense of place, but .....","This coming of age story is set in Appalachia. It has a wonderful sense of place, both in terms of the people and, especially, the environment. Unfortunately, the characters are not well developed, and the plot is of little interest. I did not finish the book, much as I enjoyed it for awhile. Yes, I have read other people's 5 star reviews."
4,Wow,"This was the first work I read by Silas House. The world is a better place because Silas is in it, and writes about it!"
5,"""Another Silas House Winner""","I bought this book after reading ""A Parchment of Leaves."" I found it very engaging,almost as readable as ""A Parchment."" The characters are colorful and vivid, and one is drawn into the story, as well as Clay's love affair. You won't be disappointed."
5,Putting together the missing pieces ............,"Silas House is one THE most gifted Southern writers! Clay's Quilt is an amazing, heart touching story about a young coal miner putting the missing pieces of his life together in order to understand who he is and where he has come from, and what his future may hold. His mother is murdered in front of him when he is barely four years old. He is taken in by family and raised and loved deeply, yet he still feels incomplete and not sure how to change that. The story of his mother, her friends and her hopes are gently pulled together and carefully, cautiously Clay begins to get a sense of who she was and why. This in turn causes him to look deep into himself and discover what life holds for him."
4,My world,"I was impressed with the novel as a first attempt from Silas House, but I was a little disappointed with the predictable nature of the story. Perhaps I knew how the story would go because it takes place in a setting just a stone's throw from where I live. I liked the characters, but, I did sometimes feel that House made them and the specifics of the story a little ""more Appalachian"" than southeastern Kentucky really is in modern times. I suppose it bothered me that House might have been quick to give readers who aren't familiar with Kentucky exactly what they expected - coal miners, bar fights, domestic violence, teenage marriages and people living in houses they built themselves. I wished it was clear that this is not an ""everyday"" situation here in southeastern Kentucky."
4,Brought back memories,"Every Saturday afternoon, as a child we'd flock tothe movies. I remember seeng this as a child and it brought back memories. In spite of what many say about Tarzan, somehow exploiting black people, I feel it was entertaining and not made to offend anyone."
2,What a dud.,"JUST PAST MIDNIGHT has a great concept - erotomania, a subject not tackled in other ""stalker"" books. Unfortunately, it is a slow-moving book with two-dimensional characters that leaves the reader wondering why they wasted an afternoon on such a dud. While the writer does make it difficult for some readers to figure out the identity of the stalker, she fails to build the tension between Richard and Darian. One minute they are rivals. The next, they're in love. What happened in between? We'll never know."
5,Fantastic read,I found this at my local Barnes and Noble and picked it up because of the great cover. I didn't put it down until I had finished the whole thing! This was a fantastic read that kept me guessing from start to finish and I would highly recommend it. It balances the line between romance and suspense perfectly. I can't wait for the next Stevens thriller
4,49th parallel,Pretty dated but still a hoot obviously a propaganda project but a great way to get the point across. Laurence Olivier does a great job wish his character hadn't been killed off so early in the movie.
5,Great war time movie,Had this movie on VHS so I decided to buy it on DVD. Great war time movie set in Canada with many stars- good adventure film as well as a propoganda film for defense of the home land. Bonus disc included watched some of the special features.
3,Turgid propaganda,"The Bottom Line:A dull propaganda film from the Archers that concerned a Nazi Uboat crew stranded in Canada trying to make its way to then-neutral America, 49th Parallel sounds a lot more interesting than it actually is; I don't object to WWII message movies on principle (Foreign Correspondent is a masterful film) but I do object to how much this picture drags in the second act and how the most developed characters are somehow the one-note evil Nazis.2.5/4"
2,Huh?,"What a terrible film. I taped it off the Tv a while back, intending to watch it when i got back from school.Well i sat there, with my mouth hanging open. Once i seen my two favourite stars in action i turned it off and found my Maths homework much more interesting.I understood exactly what was going on i just found it so boring that i couldn't watch after Laurence Olivier and Leslie Howard had made their brief apearances.The general idea of the film was awful, i can't see a film so mind numbingly boring, inspiring the Americans to join the war or help the war effort at home, more like increase the suicide rate in both countries.What i want to know why the Germans all spoke with English accents?I couldn't work out where Laurence Olivier was supposed to be from, i thought he was russian at first (bit stupid of me as he was singing an obviously french song)."
2,The Art of American Indian Cooking,This book is dry. While there is some great information in it. I found that when I put it down I could not remember one of the recipes.
3,so-so,"A fun book, but the recipes are only traditional in a pan-american sense. In other words, before the arrival of Europeans, north american indians didn't have potatoes, apples, avocados, honey, etc. If you are interested in north american indian tradition/history, this book will probably disappoint."
4,"yup, they're right","Essentially, I agree with the other reviewers, although I have to add that these essays were not ""fun"" reads. I was expecting something I couldn't put down like ""Ride the Tiger,"" but this book I finished more because I wanted to have read it than that I enjoyed reading it."
3,Great Music......Horrible Singing,"Someone somewhere when this record was being conceived, produced, recorded should have told the bass player...'NO YOU CAN'T SING!!' The music is just fine (kind of a poor man's ELP) the lyrics and the singing however bring it down to a C minus in my humble opinion."
5,"One hit, amazing wonder","Another album that I had two copies of, in case one wore out. Two members of the Nice (Keith Emerson's first band) joined forces with Patrick Moraz (later of Yes) for this one album. If only Lee Jackson could sing better. He was holding the Nice back and his vocals here are an acquired taste. But Moraz' influence shines through, making this the perfect album for fans who liked the Nice and then followed Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Long, progressive rock pieces that set great moods. Buy one before it goes out of print."
1,Maxtor External HD piece of junk,"I bought a 100 gig external Maxtor USB hard drive in December from Best Buy (Maxtor Personal Storage 3100). I was backing up the data on the hard drive to the server and the hard drive crashed (It is now only June). I only got about half the data off of it. I went to the Maxtor website to get an RMA, and imagine my surprise when I found out the warranty was only good for 90 days. What a piece of junk hard drive. NEVER buy a Maxtor drive. I'm sticking with Seagate. I bought an external Seagate drive \from Amazon and it is built like a tank and just hums along. Seagate bought Maxtor recently, though why they would besmirch their good name I don't know!Caveat Emptor (Buyer Beware)"
3,"Good, but not that good","I got mine for $100 at Best Buy about 6 months ago. It works well most of the time, however the hard drive will occasionally stop responding while it is plugged into my computer, forcing me to pull the power(!) to reset it. It works, sure, but I would have saved another few dollars for a higher spec drive from another manufacturer. Still, the price point was great."
5,Helpful and Entertaining,"What a wonderful book! As a divorced/remarried mother and stepmother, I was both surprised and thrilled to find a book for our children that hit the nail on the head so well. The kids saw themselves in the story, and it actually opened up some discussion about the competition between them. The Tips for Parents and Kids at the end are straightforward and to the point. Although this is a storybook for kids, I have to say I learned a lot about how kids feel from it."
5,Jessica' two families,This is a great book for two home families. It addresses issues children maybe having going from one home to another
5,Flora's Plant Names - I Love it,"This is a wonderful book for any gardener that is in a Garden Club that has Standard Flower Shows.When a club presents a Standard Flower Show any Horticulture Specimens, cut or container-grownthe exhibitor has to list the genus and species of the plant they are entering to be judges by a panel ofthree Nationally Accredited Flower Show Judges.This is why I love this book."
2,It's raining Jacksons,"Director Gabrielle Burton heads FIVE SISTERS PRODUCTIONS, a corporation her sisters Maria, Jennifer, Ursula and Charity are part of. Maria co-directs; all appear in this film, as do their parents. (Mom wrote the script.)In the Burton family's MANNA FROM HEAVEN, a bundle of counterfeit cash blows out the back door of a step van and onto the lawn of a dysfunctional extended family. Years later one of the recipients (who's now a nun) convinces the others they must somehow replace their windfall. To do so, they get involved in various money-raising schemes, including a less-than-honest raffle and a dance contest.A good cast is unable to save this not very amusing comedy.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(5.5) Manna from Heaven (2002) - Shirley Jones/Cloris Leachman/Louise Fletcher/Seymour Cassel/Frank Gorshin/Jill Eikenberry/Austin Pendleton/Shelley Duvall/Jerry Orbach"
1,This movie is awful!,"My husband rented this film for me and our eight year old thinking it would be a good ""family film."" In the words of our daughter, who is a discriminating movie critic - ""This movie makes no sense! You can't tell how the people are related to each other - they want you to think that they are all getting to be better people, but really, they are just getting better at lying and stealing."" The plot is implusable and confusing, the characters are hard to feel very attached to, and as my husband said, ""if the best actor played second fiddle in the dopey sit com ""Just Shoot Me,"" you know the movie is bad. He apologized for bringing it home to us."
1,This book is of very poor quality,"After you get over the unbelievable price of this book, you find that the binding is of very poor quality and the printing smears at the slightest touch. This is not a robust book that one would typically expect in a college textbook, and cannot stand up to normal handling, much less the rough treatment typically given to textbooks."
2,Not Recommended,"As a first semester college freshman with an excellent high school mathematical education, I found Larson's text insufficient in examples and explanation. Self-teaching with this text is impossible. My professor supplemented this text with many other examples and additional exercises for students who wished to truly grasp the subject matter. The number of exercises was satisfactory, however."
2,Huh?????,"This book is extremely hard to follow. Yes the graphics in the book are great and do contribute to the understanding of the course material, but what good is graphics if the language describing these graphics are above the heads of the average students? Also, my copy of this book lasted only 2 weeks before the cover started to come off and the spine started to break."
1,"Horrible Book, Bad Author","I would recommend that NOBODY purchase this book. If you see the name ""Roland E. Larson,"" try to avoid his math books. His Calculus book was wretched. A lot of the main points were never explained well, and then my teacher punished me for not understanding the things Larson never even cared to explain.In the lesson reviews, the final few questions are extremely difficult. What makes them difficult rarely even has to do with Calculus. It asks you to know some weird geometric formula or be able to do some weird trigonometric manipulation. Then I get graded for it, even though it's NOT a class in trigonometry or advanced geometry.Roland E. Larson: Stick to messing with numbers; don't mess with students."
5,Vegan Organic Kosher Choice,"Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Crispy crackers in a variety of attractive shapes. Like saltines, but not salty on top. Nice (very, very mild) garden veggie flavor, not totally bland. Excellent with organic soups or for appetizers. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices. Check out ""Vegan Grocery Favorites"" and ""Vegan Grocery Top Ten"" in Listmania. Your ""helpful"" votes count and will be greatly appreciated to benefit the search of others. Thank you."
2,Unhappy,I purchased this blade and it does not cut 2 sided melamine very well. Actually it chiped both sides of the melamine board. I removed the blade and installed an Amanna blade with out doing any thing to the saw and the Amanna blade cut perfect. Save your money and buy an Amanna.
3,As romantic as you can possibly get.,"Ricky Martin's second solo outing is a great treat for all of us romantics. In collaboration with Juan Carlos Calderon (composer & producer for various Luis Miguel albums), Mr. Martin explores his soft, sensual side.This album is off to a great start with ""No Me Pidas Mas"", but doesn't quite make it. This album seems to wander in all directions, without quite knowing where it's headed. By the end of the album (""Horray! Horray! (It's a Holiday)"") I was left a little lost. ""Horray!..."" feels like an afterthought. It was thrown in to make the album a little more upbeat.When the album let's the romace flow, however, you are in for quite a treat. There are a number of songs that can turn a nice romantic evening into an EXCELLENT romantic evening. Among my favorites are ""Entre El Amor Y Los Halagos"", ""Lo Que Nos Pase, Pasara"", and (my favorite) ""Me Amaras""."
1,Would you spend more money for brand name salt?,Monster is a joke! You can get the same quality speaker wire for 1/10 the price. I wish consumers would get wise to Monster's scams.
2,wrong product,"i bought 100 ft speaker wire and only got 50ft i waited for it for awhile, and now it's more of a hassel."
2,Not any better than 16 gauge lamp cord,"All availible double-blind testing indicates that differences between copper wire of the same gauge over the same distance is completely inaudible.Monster Cable is no better than any other cable of the same gauge in terms of audibility, except in terms of Monster's marketing budget.16 gauge stranded copper is more than enough for nearly any power draw over nearly any reasonable length of cable to any speaker.Anyone who claims otherwise has never attempted to A/B speaker wire under double blind conditions.Spend your budget on speakers and amplification and use the change in your couch to buy 16 gauge lamp cord at a hardware store. Anything more is a monumental waste of money.Thus spake Julian Hirsch, and it is the truth."
1,more Monster snake oil...,"Monster Cable and its similarly overpriced imitators are a triumph of hype over substance, and ruthlessly exploits the consumer's naivete and trust in shady audio/video salespeople.Yes, for most things you DO ""get what you pay for""---but when it comes to speaker cables, interconnects, and other a/v wiring however it's another story.All you need for optimal sound is any 12 to 16 gauge generic cable which you can buy at Home Depot for a fraction of the cost.Save your money for things like speaker stands, which really do make a world of difference."
4,Good product,Very nice speaker cable for the price. Overall sound quality is better than the standard smaller sized cable. Would recommend.
4,Very flexible for its thickness,Can't tell if the THX certification actually makes a difference in audible quality. Well built speaker cable.
5,Good and Quality copper wire,I have used this cable for my Home Theater 7.1 channel. And it really sounds great. Bottom line to get good quality sound then it better to take this cable .
5,In Wall and in Attic and Still GREAT - Dont Waste your Money on other Wire,"Amazing speaker wire for the price - I needed this wire to go from my receiver then 30 feet for each speaker around the room, all the cables go into the wall for 10 feet and then in the attic for 18 feet, I have no Noise, or anythig interferring with my sound.So dont waste your money on the Crazy priced CLR Wire when this does it fine."
5,Great stuff,Other than its being the same thickness as standard electrical cable (I'd been hoping for a bit smaller gauge) it's absolutely great. No issues with sound quality whatsoever.
1,Overpriced regular cable,This is an over priced cable. I fould OXYGEN-FREE-COPPER wire by philips for half the price here100' Better PHILIPS speaker wireMonster wire does not have the above standard.The better sound quality is from1. Source and Connection type (ex.DVD/CD player connected via optical to recevier vs connected thru RCA cables)2).Quality of speaker3). Receiver4).

2,Product was actually too good,The gauge of this cable was not specified and it turned out to be much more than my system could use.
5,Don't be Put Off by Author's Exuberance,"I agree with the enthusiastic reviews here and just wanted to add that, if one finds the author's style annoying (I do), this is still a great book. I didn't buy this book at first due to the overly-zealous style. On a second look-through I bought it, read it, and have bought multiple copies as gifts ever since. Terrific ideas to keep a child's interest as well as wonderful recommendations."
1,Useless book,"I thought it was a book on how to get my child to read, to enjoy reading. The title is deceptive. Instead, its a book advertising other books and it doesn't even tell you what the books are about or for what age group. A total waste of money!!!"
5,great reference,I am very pleased with this purchase and found it to be a great value. I didn't realize what a huge book I would receive and I am thrilled with the information crammed inside. There are so many wonderful ideas with book lists galore. I have actually carried this book around my public library looking up different recommended titles! This is a wonderful book for both parents and teachers and makes a perfect gift!
3,Darcus @ Starcrossed,"I absolutely love R.L. Stine. I always have. And even his short little kids books are not disappointing in my opinion.I was excited when I pulled this book out of a box of what seemed like a million books that we had stored in our shed. I had no idea that it was there, but apparently my husband had been holding out on me.This book reminded of Invasion of The Body Snatchers, if there were a kids version. And as it seemed, there was even a reference to the movie in My Alien Parents.It was a very short book, but it still had the classic R.L. Stine twist at the end that you weren't expecting. Very reminiscent of the Goosebumps series.I loved it!"
2,Where do I start?,"Very dry material, difficult to get through! I had to read it for a class, and it was torturous, to the point of falling asleep."
5,Here's all the information you need to get up and running with ASP.NET,"Examples, insights, and even code samples pack a reference for programmers working in C# and VB in an updated second edition to a popular step-by-step guide. Here's all the information you need to get up and running with ASP.NET, from how to build a first web site to applying the free code samples within to more advanced projects. It's a top pick programmers - especially newcomers to ASP.NET - won't want to be without."
4,Awesome Primer!,"This book is helping me to learn ASP.NET with VB.NET. I wish the author would have spent more time discussing the IDE of VisualStudio.NET, but as a beginner's book, it's everything I'd hoped for!"
5,A great reading,"Written by a web expert, it shows readers how to create the basic, dynamic, and advanced ASP.NET pages in Microsoft's .Netprogramming languages, and explains how to interact with the database using ADO.NET.The author reviews the fundamentals on Object Oriented Programming with clever and easy to use examples. He also explains how to create web forms and web controls.The author covers every aspect of developing a Web application including building an e-commerce site or reinforcing the security.One thing I particularly like in this book is the code published in the two main .Net languages, C# and VB.NET.Thumb up !"
4,Nicely presented material and easy to understand...,I had a really good look at this alongside about 10 other books (in a book store for a few hours) and it was one of two that I finally selected. What I really like is the fact that the website screenshots looks like a decent professional website. So many of these ASP.Net books show screenshots of websites that look totally amateurish and unusable in the real World. I like to see programming books that show slick results and this book fixes that problem with some very cool screenshots.It has decent technical coverage of the material and it's very nicely laid out and easy to digest.It's a great beginner/intermediate level book if you're just starting out.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
3,jToo narrow a focus even for beginners,"This book has a particular focus, to build a very simple website. But it also tries to cover (some) C# and VB, and doesn't do much for either language, and for such a simple example site, the languages don't much matter.What did bother me was leaving out information - for instance, in discussing building a Master page, they decide to skip how to build the sidebar menu, say they'll just build the header and footer, and then forget all about the footer, too!It would be better for someone who wants to learn C# to just get a book on that, or learn it however they can; and then pick another book on ASP.NET"
1,Save Your Money,"I have the 2005 edition of this book. The 2005 edition of this book was written by an author who teaches ASP.NET in San Diego. The 2005 addition author takes time to explain concepts and the real estate of Visual Web Developer. Unfortunately, in chapter 6 the book refers to Web Data Administrator which is obsolete, so I decided to buy the latest revision. Well, the third addition was written by new authors, which seems to give only the facts with little or no explanation of concepts. The third addition is a clumsy read. I grew tired of fighting to understand what the xxxx the authors where taking about so I returned the book.***The preceding statements are not a statement of fact but merely the personal, subjective opinion of the writer."
1,Did get what I purchased,The book I received is not the one I ordered. Though it has the same name as the one I ordered it was an older version (10 years old) most of the coding examples used in the book is out of date.This will be the last time I buy a book from you.
3,Good but could have used some live cuts for 2 cd set,"I can't comment on whether this set is properly representative or otherwise comprehensive as I have not heard the solo albums these were drawn from as I just know the ""hits"" from this set. Still, I am familiar with most of the WHO albums and I can say that this is quite a bit different from them, but at least approaching the same quality of music. Good writing and a great sound, a definite step above a typical side project album. I don't find myself skipping through the tracks as I do on some lesser collections. However; as this is a two CD set it would have been nice to hear some live material such as the ""Deep End"" recordings."
5,From a Long Time Customer,"I remember Alex's palce in New Iberia from the early 80's. Great food, my wife and I lived in Lafayette and ate there once a week. We bought the book years ago, shortly after it was published. We still use it today. Try Shrimp Mrs. Ann. You can use fish instead of shrimp and it is still wonderful. The green beans in a roux is very good. There are a number of books on Cajun cooking, this is one of the best."
5,The Real Thing,"My husband is Cajun, I'm from New York, so making gumbo, etoufee or chicken stew is daunting. The highest complement he can give is that it tastes like his grandma's -- and every recipe from this book hits that high water mark. The only change I make is to omit the okra from the gumbo.Try the Sweet Potato Casserole with Pecan Topping - it will be come the staple at your Thanksgiving table."
3,Mah Jongg video,"This video is just OK. I did get some pointers from it, but I bought another video called ""Mah Jongg with Susie"" a very helpful video."
4,A good resource,I used this book to study for the ANCC FNP certification exam (and passed). I found the book to be helpful in studying. Each chapter/section is concise and the review questions are helpful. I would have liked the topics organized by body systems instead of alphabetically. This book will be helpful in clinical practice as well.
2,Accompaning CD is being revised,"DO NOT buy this book until the CD is revised. The CD practice tests give all the wrong answers. I called Mosby's and they said they were working on the ""glitch"" as they put it. just my opinion but do not buy the book until the CD is fixed. I don't know what version the other people who rated this book have but i don't think its the same as the one I have. Are these people fictious? I don't know how they can give the book these ratings."
1,The CD ROM is AWFUL!,"If you are looking for a book with CD ROM to practice test questions on the computer...DON'T BUY THIS BOOK! The answers are incorrectly programmed so even though the rationales make sense, it is graded entirely wrong. Ditto what the other reviewers has to say about this major flaw..."
4,Classic early appearance from SNL superstars,"Featuring Dana Carvey and Kwevin Nealon (of Saturday Night Live), this 1985 release features 6 stand-up routines. Other comedians include Joe Alasky, Charles Fleisherm J J Wall and none other than the infamous SINBAD! Hysterical stand-up and an absolutely MUST-HAVE for comedy collector's. Would love to have this on dvd, but is so obscure I doubt the even still have the original film!! 1987 Veston Video"
4,Has it's moments,"This movie has a scene where Natalie P. hides behind a column in the aiport, while Susan S. (her Mother) is frantically looking for her. Natalie's character was verifying if her mother would care if she wasn't around anymore. I felt it was a good scene that really makes the film."
4,Definitely worth watching,"I really liked this movie! The ending was better than the way it ended in the book, although you would get a lot more out of the movie if you read the book first. It's really more of a character study than anything else, and a very good one. The plot is kind of rambling and makes you wonder where it's going--there doesn't seem to be much of a point until the very end--but Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman have great chemistry and both do an excellent acting job. Mostly, this is a wonderful movie, if something of a ""chick flick"" :-) I recommend it!"
3,Good acting but boring!,"Same scenes- the apartment where both lives their life. I think the movie is not clear in several things. First is about Anne's father. I don't know why they really break up. Well, I can guess but I am not sure about it. Second is about the fact that Anne's friend changes a lot. Why does she change? Or, I am not clear on how come her friend says Anne changes. Both mother and Anne have really good shots."
1,"The model ""chick flick""","If it wasn't for Susan Sarandon this movie would've been about ten times worse than it already is. That said though I still think the movie blows.Natalie Portman pouts her way through every scene, just like she does in all her movies.It's the same old cliche with all the characters too. Who cares about these people? Not me."
2,Unlikeable,"Unmemorable except for the fact that I remember it was depressing without being introspective, very meaningful, or even likeable."
2,not serious,"don't take this movie seriously, not even a serious comedy. It had some fun moments - not worth dedicated time - but to do other things at same time it's a nice background light entertainment."
5,Good Condition,"Was in very good condition when I received this movie. Came with cover, which was also in good condition."
2,good thing I saw it for free...,"What do you do with a couple hours to kill and a movie on tv? This movie was about as pointless as they get. Susan Sarandon plays the same absent-minded flightly woman she seems to play in most of her movies. Natalie Portman is a great actress but even she couldn't save this movie from being as lame as it was. It's the kind of movie where you debate whether to (and almost decide to) turn it off and get back to cleaning the bathroom the entire time.Not for me. Even though it's a mother-daughter show, I tried to watch it with an open mind. Nope. Not ever again. And I can't recommend it either."
1,Unlikable and annoying characters,"A mother/daughter story has potential to demonstrate some sort of conflict and resolution between parent and child. Or even demonstrate acceptance of one character's inability to change the other.However, this movie just stumbles along without a suitable resolution. Susan Sarandon's flighty self-absorbed demeanor gets increasingly annoying and Natalie Portman's numb portrayal of a daughter dragged along for the ride inspires little compassion from the viewer. If I couldn't find something to like about at least one of the characters, why would I care what happened to either one of them? By the time the movie came to it's inevitably predictable conclusion, I was unclenching my jaw in relief."
3,good!,I liked this movie was ok. It was kind of slow. They had some really good parts that I thought were cute. But the daughter just really got on my nerves with all the crying. Other than that the movie was ok.
4,What if things had not changed?,"I noticed that the effects of Ann if she had not moved to Beverly Hills arises in the changes in her best friend Mary (Thora Birch). Mary was a sweet girl when Ann moved to Beverly Hills, and when Ann came back under unfortunate circumstances, Mary had changed...she smoked and dressed different. It shows us a clue how Ann could have changed into if she didn't move from Bay City. I wish Thora Birch was in it more, but on the other hand, her character wasn't relevant to the movie other than this p.o.v."
4,"Great Movie, Natalie Portman was amazing",Once again Natalie Portman does a terrific job. She and Susan Surandon combine to make a terrific movie. The movie would have been perfect if their wouldn't have been so much crying. The movie actually was too sad. But Natalie Portman makes the movie shine with her incredible acting skills. She is truly the best actress i have seen to this day. This is a movie that i would suggest to anyone!
2,TAKE OUT SUSAN,I loved the romantic storyline...that just trailed off...between Natalie and that guy...but I hated EVERYTHING Susan Sarandon contributed...If you want a good movie rent Where the Heart is...with Natalie Portman...it is MUCH BETTER
4,Mother and Daughter re-define their relationship as they grow,"Susan Sarandon is a perfect choice for this quirky, yet very human portrayal of a single-mom who lives in her own theatrical reality. Her daughter is the more mature of the two, played by a very green yet forceful Natlie Portman, and she has the unfortunate task of trying to find her own identity while keeping the pieces of her mother intact while they pursue her mother's quest for a life of glamour-even if said glamour is not exactly the usual definition of the word. This movie is all about self-exploration and being able to find yourself without losing the relationships already present in your life."
3,Good movie for teenagers,"I purchased this for my teenage daughters and they loved it! I liked it too though which is why I purchased it to tell the truth. It's a warm story of a mother and daughter who move to CA as the mother seeks a better life for her and the daughter played by Natalie Portman. The mother character is annoying at times (Susan Sarandon) and I really don't think Sarandon comes across as the typical mother figure. The movie has some heartwarming moments and shows the struggles a single parent must endure to support their child. Although I like this movie, I think the storyline was weak. Natalie is too good of an actress for a poor story like this."
4,A Highly Readable and Informative Work,"This is not a dry and antiseptic treatise, but rather a highly engaging and informative work that grabs you early with a provocative foreshadowing of its premise and keeps you hooked right to the astonishing end. The authors build their case with logic and sometimes shocking detail taken directly from the national archives, making you wonder what other ""smoking guns"" may still lie waiting for perservering sleuths such as those who worked behind the scenes in researching this fascinating book. A ""must read"" not only for Kennedy conspiracy buffs, but for anyone interested in a candid and unflinching historical view of the Mafia, the French underground, heroin trafficking, the underbelly of American politics, and the events leading up to the Vietnam War."
3,"double delite, lenny dee at the organ","It is very definately Lenny Dee and the sounds of the organ, however it is in a rather dull, lack of fidelity would be a better way of saying it and very definately Monofonic, granted it was not advertized as stero just remastered...."
3,"Fictionalization of Mungo Park's own ""Travels"" book","I enjoyed reading this book and I thought it was quite good, until I discovered Mungo Park's (the book's main character) own ""Travels in the Interior of Africa"" (1798) written after his first expedition to Africa. Most of the things that I thought were clever and imaginative in Boyle's book come straight from Park's first hand account. Boyle should have acknowledged Park's book in his novel and made it more clear what he invented himself and what Park actually wrote. If you are seriously interested in history and adventure travel, read Park's book."
3,Snide and Clever,"Boyle is most definitely a writer for the present -- trendy, snide, clever, precious, and sounding as if he'd just graduated from some foul Master of Fine Arts in Writing program. I kept picking this novel up because of the gasping praise of the reviewers and the fact that I find Mungo Park rather interesting, but I just kept putting it back down after finding, once again, that it was simply not to my taste. Boyle is supposedly very inventive -- I find him rather tedious and predictably contemporary. MFA stuff, approved by the professors of ""creative writing,"" but ultimately pretty hollow and trendy, like any other fashion statement. For those who like their writing with the MFA seal of approval."
3,"Strong Start, Strained Ending","This is a difficult book to classify, because it contains at least two distinct parts, and I do not here refer to the paralleled stories of Ned Rise and Mungo Park. The first part of the book is deliciously humorous and great fun; I'm not sure whether Boyle's mood changed or he ran out of steam for the second part. Though it contains some witticisms, the tone of the second part is completely dissimilar to that of the first. The comedy which made the first part so uproariously fun is completely absent, replaced by something resembling satire or tragedy, but lacking the wit to pull either off. The first part of this book is worthy of 5 stars. The second, though it has its moments, barely manages a 2."
3,history and the novel,"If someone asks me whether they should read this book or not i will have two things to say to them: if you are interested in history, read this book; if you are interested in reading a good novel with a story, choose another book. As far as the historical information in this book is concerned, it was written masterfully. Descriptions of the events and the customs were seemingly perfect and there were no lose ends. On the other hand, this was not a book that I would read again, just for fun. The characters that were well developed didnot evoke any emotions within me. And the characters which were underdeveloped were ones which I think that I could have sympathized, or empathized for, but they were not developed. There was too much historical information, and it got in the way of the side stories, which I think could have been developed better."
3,Quite Enjoyable,"Boyle is an excellent story teller, and ""Water Music"" is a terrific read. The narrative flows along at quite a clip as the plot ricochets between characters. Boyle's sense of humor is strong, and I found myself laughing out loud on more than one occasion. While a jacket review compares the work of Boyle to Pynchon, I find little grounds for this. The intellectual attributes of the book fail to approach that of any Pynchon. But why make such a comparison?Water music is a splendid story quite wonderfully told- an excellent beach book."
5,Happy riveting,This is a very reliable piece of equipment for a great price. I have set several hundred rivets in hard to get spaces - not one failure!
4,Give me more...,"We had to wait while CE struggled to get this released in England but it was worth every second. It has a workable system, plenty of background and captures the feel of Babylon 5 to a tee. Whether you're a fan of the series or a gamer this is worth a look."
3,"Does the job, but should have longer screws","This product was good enough to keep, but it wasn't quite what I hoped. First, the screws are not long enough to prevent someone from just busting through the door. If you are trying to prevent somebody from entering with force, definitely get longer screws and maybe consider a heavier duty slide bolt. Second, this is definitely light duty, in fact the metal bends if you tighten the screws too much on the part that slides. It is definitely a step up from the sliding chain contraptions, but someone could probably kick their way through the door if you were relying only on this. If you are truly trying to prevent a forced entry, then I'd recommend one that is heavier duty."
4,Works well,Construction is of very thin metal compared to exact same latch in brass it replaced. Do not expect heavy duty for security.
5,Excellent,"Excellent work on the ""problem of evil"" in religion. For serious intellectual contemplaters only. Whether you ultimately agree or disagree with Augustine's premise, you will certainly appreciate the depth in which he addresses an issue that the world's most prolific religions readily ignore. If God is all good and God is the creator, why is there bad?"
2,Augustine,"The book is fine, but the pages were bound in such a way that the first time I turn each page, it falls out of the binding. It's still readable and everything... it's just a huge hassle to keep everything together."
4,"Very interesting, very philosophical","The book is written as an interview by a young student asking Augustine the questions of life, happiness, numbers, sin, and the will. A bit confusing at times for a dummy like me, but very enlightening nonetheless!"
1,uggg.,"Someone recommended this book as the epitome of Augustine's philosophical work. It tries to replicate the style of Plato's dialogues, but its shallow logic, infantile writing, and general poor scholarship as well as just plain lousy thought and development makes me feel like I got gypped buying it.If I could, I would ask for a refund. Ugggg."
2,NOT like Dara Joy,"This is the first Jaid Black novel I've read, and although I can really get into a steamy romance, the writing is poor. I found myself thinking that this is what it would be like to READ a soft-porn movie. Actually, I've seen some soft porn that has better plots.Additionally, I gave it only two stars because I like sci-fi and ""The Empress' New Clothes"" was tough to take because it was really poor sci-fi. I mean, come on... how plausable is it that the sands that cover that world are all in bright, jewel-tone colors, the entire palace is carved out of crystal, precious stones are everywhere and the slaves are really enchanted from the colored sands (can't imagine their skin was too soft or smooth).I couldn't give it one star because despite all its flaws, I kept reading."
1,Really disappointed,"I got this book thinking although it's not my normal reading style, I would enjoy it. I couldn't even finish the book I was so disgusted with it. I get the whole kidnapped thing but the charaters in this were awful. Kyra drove me nuts from the beginning. How any women in her right mind would be able to handle getting kidnapped, fondled by everyone it seems, given to another by her ""sacred mate"" and then decides hey I love him so it's okay? Not to mention the whole every female has to be naked or mostly naked seems to run in Ms. Black's books and I can't understand why. I see others really enjoyed it so it must have been just me but the plot was bad, the characters were worse. This is the second book I tried by this author and I won't be trying any more."
2,Mariaelena Kibbe,Too vulgar!!! I disagree completely with the hero having sex with all kinds of women. Sorry but not for me.
4,ZOR A MAN TO DREAM OF,The story was very good it wasn't hard core but that's the way I like um. Zor is a man you can dream of.
4,Hot!!,I loved this first book by Jaid Black. It was very erotic and I found myself drawn into this whole world she created.
3,OK-Don't Understand the Hype,"This book was OK. I am definitely in the minority on this one, but I didn't find it particularly hot. Most of the sex scenes just didn't do it for me. While there were an abundance of them, they were not very graphic or enticing. I also didn't find the book to be particularly well written. Try Marly Chance for some really hot books."
2,Not working for me.,"I've heard so many people mention that these books were sort of their introduction to romance and erotica, so I decided to check them out. It was so bad. Plot was okay. Characters felt a bit fake, especially the token black girl, Geris (head bob, finger snap, umm-hmm, girl). Converstations stilted and boring. What I don't get is that there is a whole series here."
3,My empire for a proofreader!,"As an avid reader, I read several Kindle ebooks in the romance, scifi, paranormal, fantasy and other genres per week. So, I am used to seeing many spelling and grammatical errors. It's never been enough of an issue to mention in a review before, but by a quarter of the way through this book I was ready to pull my hair out over the errors in names of real people referenced. In the 21st century, with spell-check and Google, there is no excuse. For example: Fay Ray (Wray), Hugh Heffner (Hefner), Thumbalina (Thumbelina) and Pamela SUE Anderson? So, authors, please have your works proofread. Maybe it's just me, but it annoys the hell out of me while I'm trying to enjoy a book."
2,Why was this rated one of her better reads!,I don't get the apeal of this series....it just was so high school boy fantasy....girls with big boobs dumb. Blacks other stories are a HUNDRED times BETTER than this stupidity
5,The Empress' New clothes,"I love the whole series but this one is my favorite by far. Jaid Black never fails. I could not stop laughing. This books is amazing, funny, sexy, and smart (did I say sexy). Will read it over and over.Anya"
5,"""Un cafe nome desir""...","I haven't ordered this from Amazon, but can certainly vouch that this coffee is without a doubt the best! It is a pity that it should be so pricey online while you can get a three pack in a regular supermarket in France for less that 10 euros. Quite shameful, really..."
3,Better than others,"Pretty good coffee - not the best I've ever had and not quite like in Europe. Good enough that I might consider buying it again, but not unbelievable.(Better than the year-old Illy or Lavazza you find in stores in the US)"
2,Carte Noire,"I had this coffee during my trip to Paris, it was very good. I bought this coffee but it was not fresh or had the same aroma as the one I had in Paris, I don't think I will buy it again."
5,Great Bubble Bath,"I love this stuff. There are no strange chemicals and it's made in the USA. It bubbles up great with just one capful (we have a standard size tub) and this particular one has the best smell.My toddler isnt a picky child so she would probably like anything that bubbles. That said, she does enjoy this bubble bath. We both enjoy blowing bubbles.So, really, I buy it for my peace of mind. It is pricy but the price is worth it knowing that I am not exposing my child to chemicals that could effect her growth and development. And we are able to make a bottle last approximately 2 months."
2,"Low quality fabric, should have returned","Quality is not what I was expecting from a Quicksilver product. The shirt was thin and cheap, makes a good shirt to work around the house in, just not something I would wear in public."
3,Not well made,"This karaoke machine would be great with all of its features, except the mic did not work from the beginning and we had to take it back. A big disappointment for Christmas. My husband, who purchased it at Circuit City, said they told him it was the nicest karaoke machine they sold, but he recommended purchasing a 1-2 year warranty because a lot of customers complained about parts breaking... as we saw firsthand.Otherwise, it has a great set of features - you can record on cassette, watch yourself on the camera, read lyrics from the screen, or sing a duet (only 1 mic included, but you can plug in another). You can also plug it in to a TV so that you either see yourself singing thru the camera OR watch the lyrics on the TV. It really would have been a great all-in-one machine...It seems like to get a quality karaoke machine that doesn't break easily, you need to step up to the next price-point, at around $250-300+."
5,Great Karaoke Machine!,Reviewers this is a great karaoke machine. It has great sound and the microphone works well. Be sure mot to pull on the microphone's wire or step on it because the wire will become loose and will not work anymore. It has echo effect that can add to songs you might sing. I recommend this item to people who like to sing for fun
2,Workaday readings that badly need a pep pill,"Comparisons aren't odious when it comes to CDs, and this Bernstein collection from Marin Alsop, however well intended, is so laking in the composer's own verve and brio that the music emerges as almost unrecognizable. Strangley, Alsop bills herself as a Bersntein protegee -- did she bother to hear his riveting performances of Facsimile and the Serenade after Plato's Symposium? Every rhythmn is smoothed out and flattened. The exuberance has been drained out and replaced with soggy respectability. Alsop's Bournemouth forces are clueless about the American idiom, and if you take a cursory listen to readings of the Serenade done by Perlman and (especially) Isaac Stern, Philippe Quint seems like pretty weak tea.In short, the positive reviews below seem incomprehensible to me. Do these people like jazz played by Mantovani strings? They must."
4,"Serenade, Facsimile, Divertimento by L. Bernstein","Serenade, Facsimile & Divertimento by Leonard Bernstein conducted by one of his protege's, Marin Alsop, on an economy Naxos label is a really good selection of his more down to earth instrumental music. The interpretations are lively, refreshing and accurate from the podium. I admired the agile solo playing of Philip Quint in the Serenade, which is sort of a violin concerto in the form of a suite. The hardly known Bournemouth Symphony proves its high caliber in this difficult music. The audio is clear and well balanced."
3,Know what you're getting,"This is for Ricoh Printer cartridge 88279. These are the 5,000 page cartridges, not the 15,000 page cartridges. If you don't need to use the printer for vast print jobs the lower price may interest you. If, however, you do a lot of color printing, which is why I bought this printer in the first place, go elsewhere. You are paying about half the price but receiving one third the product."
3,Ok but can be better.,"The only problem i got is the socks loose the new look after the first o second wash. Very conformtable, very cushion."
1,WARNING,"I'm a size 11. These socks fit great when new. After 1-2 washes, they were snug. After 3-4 washes, I think they might fit my 3-yr-old nephew. I'd call these a size 5-6, not 6-12."
1,Waste of Money,"The three black bands under the ball of the foot wear out really fast and the sock has to go in the trash. I like all my socks to be the same so I buy in bulk and usually just toss all the old socks out. This time I never got around to throwing away the old socks and it's a good thing, because 12 pair of Adidas purchased while I was buying Halloween stuff (six months ago) has become two pair and they're not long for this world either. I'm on Amazon to buy replacements, these popped up in the search and I felt compelled to leave a rating."
1,Useless,"It has no way of securely holding a PC other than gravity and friction. For that matter it won't even stay together by itself without gravity. Without a PC if you try and pick it up it just falls apart. It's leg adjustments don't lock, it will simply spread open, it won't grip your PC and it'll fall out especially if you try and move it. The only support for the center, which it needs, is a post or base that loosely attaches underneath rendering the wheels useless.I got it so I could tuck my PC out of the way but be able to roll it out for servicing. First off it won't roll, secondly it won't allow for removal of the panels unless you remove it from the stand.Pure junk."
1,"Decent hampers, horrible packaging","These are good value for money, lightweight, easily dented aluminum hampers. If you're anything like me, the lightweight part is nice because you can carry them to the laundry room without having to switch containers. HOWEVER, the seller who I think is Ace Hardware ships them without any padding. All it comes in is a clear plastic bag and the original box. No padding, no styrofoam, no bubblewrap. I ordered 2 and they both arrived completely dented and damaged. What a lousy way to screw up an otherwise decent product."
4,Blue Max a Winner,"This is a very entertaining story of WWI air combat. The flight scenes are well done and the planes appear authentic. A young George Peppard plays the main character very well, with coldness and intensity as he competes with the wealthier aristocratic pilots who look down on him. The romantic scenes with Ursula Andress are sort of tame by todays standards; keep in mind this movie is 40 yrs old and standards were different back then. James Mason has a small role as a German general who politizes the pilot into a war hero, playing the role with proper authority."
4,WW One in the air,"Power, Greed, Pride and some wonderful biplane film. I had forgotten quite a bit of this since I saw it back in the 60's.Again, wonderful footage and sound of the air war."
5,A flying fan's movie,"If you are a fan of flying or WWI aircraft, this movie is worth the price. The planes steal the show, though, as others have noted, the transfer was made from an apparently scratched film, which is a little surprising. Nonetheless, all the detail is there with an attention that even grognards will appreciate. Peppard does the best acting of his career, imho, and his performance will be an eye opener to all those who only remember him from such lame work as ""The A-Team."" But the aircraft are what the movie is about. The dogfight sequences are meticulously arranged. Those viewers with experience in ACM will be able to follow what is happening and what the pilots are trying to do with only a few instances leaving you with ""How'd he do THAT?!??"""
3,A fair WW I flying movie,"For those interested, this movie is vastly different from the book, & in many ways, not as good. (example: he dies at the end)Lots of great flying scenes, violence, dying (war), etc.If you like WW I area flying, it's worth watching, but not the best movie or war movie. (many better ones out there)The main character is a poor character---as in, poor morals, not poor acting.Overall, not a bad WWI movie, but, not great either. (3/5)"
4,"Good Story, Bad DVD","Had seen this movie before and liked it very much. It's an interesting story, very believable in WW-I Germany, and I like the casting much. Butas I suspected film quality very poor. Delayed buying it hoping it would be reworked. This is obviously only a copy of the original film and thequality, mostly lighting and some sound, is unacceptable to me. Would buy it in Blu-Ray if improved."
4,The Blue Max Will Please Red Baron Fans,The Blue Max includes some of the most realistic air combat cinematography in color relating to WWI fighter planes and their tactics.The movie is a collector's item for those who wish to experience how and in what type of machines the present day fighter pilots' ancestors fought for their countries in the skies over Europe.
3,Vintage Aircraft,"A nice tapestry woven around some WW-1 aircraft, some charactors are based on real life people of the era and the aircraft action shots are magnificent. The story has some dull spots but over all this is a video you might watch more than once. I have."
4,Blue Max for Stachel & Blue Max for the film.,"The first scene was memorable - the infantryman in the trench gazing up at the fighter circling serenely above, the music which was by Gerry Goldsmith was beautiful and descriptive; when I listen to it at home I can vizualise every scene. The story line did not exactly parallel the book but was nevertheless well done, it was the usual mixture of human things-Ambition,deceit,love and treachery, the characters were all well portrayed; the colour, the music the photography and those great replica planes made this an exceptional and unforgettable film.JOHN CAUCUTT,ESSEX,ENGLAND."
4,fun movie,"Fun footage of WWI air combat if that's your thing. Not hating on the movie, but it just sits in my cabinet. You want to buy mine?"
5,Great movie and a nice addition to mu collection.,One of my favorite war drama movies with great action scenes and terrific action by all the stars.The older aircraft makes this movie a must see for airplane buffs.
4,"A very good, if not forgotten film.","I first saw this film as a boy on a Saturday afternoon t.v. matinee, and was completely intrigued. Thirty years later I bought the VHS out of a bargain bin and found that the film was just as good as I remember it. Needless to say it is one of George Peppard's finest performances, supported by an all star cast. The movie has a good storyline, but the flying and dog fighting scenes are what really make the film. That with some good old class warfare, are what really put the story together. It is a classic underdog tale of a commoner, who will stop at nothing to make a name for himself among the aristocrats who will use him, but never accept him as an equal."
4,Blue Max,"I saw this when i was young in first release. After seeing now again i was not dissappointed. it's a long movie but seems short. Good action sequences refreshingly without CGI. If you like the genre, you will like this movie."
4,Blue Max,"The movie content is great, but the quality of the recording was a disappointment. Many of the scenes in the second half of the movie were very dark. Fortunately, the flying scenes were good. All in all, I was disappointed."
2,Lousy Film; great flights,"The dramatic narrative makes no sense. How would a lowly infantryman with two years of trench warfare experience somehow be transformed into a WWI aviator, posted with the aristocrats of the war?Why would such an aviator, relying on his fellow pilots for support, maintain an antagonistic relationship with his fellow officers? Not only this, some kind of ongoing in-you-face conflict with one of the unit's best fighters?Why would a German general, at the very end of the war, attempt to launch some kind of ""propaganda campaign"" to affect public opinion. . . when the public supported the war, and later blamed the generals for selling out Germany?And, at the end of the day, how are we expected to believe that our aviator believes the Blue Max award will somehow make him a real man? It's just a medal.The movie is a real leap from what the reality of that situation would be. However, the flight sequences are great!"
4,The Blue Max,"Great flying sequences. As a former military fighter pilot, the scenes to me,were believable and real for the time that the movie was made. Acting was excellent but what would you expect from George Peppard and Ursula Andress. James Mason was phenomenal. All the aircraft were pristinely restored."
5,The Blue Max DVD,"I already knew I loved this movie. What is important is that the DVD is of the highest quality and the price was excellent. If you are a WWI Airwar buff, you must see this movie. It is told from the German side of the conflict . Even if you don't care about aircraft, the air war or history, the movie stands on it's own as a mystery, action thriller. Buying through Amazon has always been a pleasant experience for me."
2,Where's the atmosphere?,"I purchased this hoping to replace my old vinyl version with a CD version especially for my 9 year old son to enjoy as I did when I was a kid. The music is great but why didn't they include the original Porsche and Ferrari sounds which made the original so wonderful?They could have done without the Hunter soundtrack and replaced it with the vinyl version of Le Mans. Then we'd have the best of both worlds.If you are after the music only, this is great. But for those who recall the wonderful original soundtrack, you'll have a bit of a let down."
4,Not perfect but close,"I use it to listen to audiobooks from my PDA. As other reviewers noted the sound quality is typical to similar devices - not great, but for audiobooks it doesn't matter. I have had the Irock for several months. There are two minor defects that I noticed - sometimes it 1. refuses to turn on and 2. when turned on it configures itsef to work on the very first FM channel, not the one it was tuned to before. I noticed that #1 happened more often during cold weather. Other than that it works fine - strong signal etc."
2,Not Impressed,"I was not impressed with the product. I had trouble getting it to turn off and on and had to force it into the socket. Got lots of static no matter which station I tried. If you have a cassette player, get the cassette version to use your MP3 player -- much better quality."
1,absolutely awful,"I purchased this transmitter to broadcast my XM receiver in my car. This transmitter is so low powered it was completely overpowered by any local stations. The sound, when you can get it, is completely awful, unlistenable, full of static. We went on a 300 mile road trip with this thing and weren't able to find anywhere where this receiver came in well. I am sending it back and looking for something else."
2,"Predictable, BOR-ING, wooden acting","I gave it two stars, because in truth, I have seen worse movies (how about ""The Wedding Planner?"" Sorry, I digress)--BUT NOT BY MUCH. I am not immune to the charms of good teen movies (witness ""Clueless,"" ""Never Been Kissed,"" ""10 Things I Hate About You"") but this movie was beyond even my sap-intake level. I thought Lee Lee (sp?) Sobieski was so vanilla that it was incredible either of these guys found her interesting, far less worth squabbling over. You saw (Ending Giveaway Alert) the demise of her character a mile away (more precisely, at the beginning of the movie), and the whole Kelley character's (no to disrespect intended) deceased mother/standing in the rain scene was nauseating. Spend some quality time with an amazing love story, acted to perfection, and invest in BBC's ""Pride and Prejudice""--also the inspiration for ""Bridget Jones' Diary,"" for those of you who might otherwise dismiss Jane Austen's inestimable charms!"
4,"Sad, but not heartbreaking","The more I watch this movie, the more I like it. But I have to agree with some people: they don't show enough Josh Hartnett and I wouldn't pick Chris Klein over Josh Hartnett.The thing that makes me mad about this movie, is that while Jasper (Josh Hartnett) does the reasonable thing and move aside, it breaks my heart that he's hurting and nobody is there for him and asking how he feels. He's most likely hurting more than Kelley (Chris Klein).The movie is good, but I wish it could've involved Jasper's feelings."
5,Great Movie,"This movie was refreshing, it held my interest for the whole length of the movie. I've thought about this movie ever since I first saw it. The characters were great, ALL of them. I would recommend this movie to anyone."
5,My favorite movie,"""Here On Earth"" is a great movie. I looked for it yesterday at the mall and the store had it on DVD but not VHS. I wasn't very happy about that. I think Leelee Sobieski is a very talented young actress and Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett are very talented young actors. I think Chris Klein is a hottie! Anyone who likes sappy chick flicks should buy or rent this movie. I am going to buy it soon."
1,Terrible,"The story was incredibly predictable and incorporated all of the ""adult"" issues. (cancer, suicide, car crashes) Although JOsh Hartnett shined as usual, his character was written badly, and LeeLee Sobieski and Chris Klein were terrible. Sobieski was anorexically thin, extremely dis believable and it made you wonder why Hartnett and Klein wanted her so badly. The plot was such a cliche story and although with different actors cast in Klein's and Sobieski's roles, it might have been a bit better, the overall result was terrible."
2,bah Humbug,"Ok I guess this movie would be ok if the hot guy got the girl, ... Chris Klein is a bad actor although he did ok in this movie. Who wants to see something that you don't want to see? exaclt the point. Josh Hartnett's character was to nice. Thought hot to nice."
1,Even Hilary Duff is a better actor than this.....,"Warning, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! The acting was horrible, and the movie was pointless! I have never seen such a bad movie in my life. I was appalled! This movie should have never been made. Can someone say burn this DVD? If you buy this movie, you are only going to contribute waste to landfills."
2,Oh please . . . We've seen this before,"The moment Leelee's character starts dying, this movie starts to smell foul. It becomes so cliche and boring. We've seen this kind of drivel before.This is not an A movie. There's better romance films out there, ""Titanic"", ""The Bridges of Madison County"".This is just dust under the rug."
1,Wow........,"Well the first time I watched this, I'm gonna admit this, it was only for Josh Hartnett. And all I can say is....Good God what a waste of his good acting talent. Were we supposed to hate his character for getting in the way of Leelee Sobieski's and Chris Klein's? If anything, all it did was make those two look like jerks for hurting the other guy. Maybe I could be more sympathetic if Sam(Sobieski) was in love with Kelley(Klein) and Jasper(Hartnett) treated her like crap. But Jasper was nothing but sweet to her and she walked over him. And comparing it to Love Story? Nope, don't think so.I know quite a few people liked this movie, but I don't. If you're a Josh fan, you'll kinda be disappointed. A Leelee fan, I recommend Never Been Kissed, and a Chris fan, Election. Not this movie."
4,It was an ok movie.,Me being a big fan of leelee I recently rented this and watched it.Leelee did a great job and so did hartnett. The storyline was great but i didnt like the part where kelley ups and leaves at the end just to return a little later. If it were me I would of never of left. I would of stayed by her side till the very end. Leelee was a great actor and did her best to make it believable but Chris Klein hardly smiled at all when onscreen. Acting is where you make it believable but he hardly did that at all. If i were on the screen with her instead of Chris Klein I would talk more and smile a hell of alot more. I think the only reason why he got in this movie is because of his looks. His acting skills in this movie are well okay but it sucks in this kind of movie when he shows no emotion. Makes it kind of boring.Only reason why I like this movie is cuz leelee is in it and she did a great job.
2,"Boring, boring, boring",I watched this movie on VHS and found it amazingly slow and dumb. Fans of Chris Klein will only be disappointed by how miscast he is as an angry rich kid.
5,"A Definate ""Watch Again, & Again ,& Again"" Movie!","This movie keeps me engaged from beginning to end. If you love watching young people being surprisingly mature and wise beyond their years (LeeLee's character), yet recklessly in love at times (Hartnett & Klein's characters), you'll like this movie. It's the story of two teen boys putting back and making right what they have ruined, and a teen girl finding out that her longtime bestfriend/boyfriend (one of the boys} isn't necessarally her ""true"" love....Can you guess what role the other boy plays?... The Robert Frost poem used as the backdrop of the film lends a special meaning. Music tops it off perfectly. It is truely a ""tear yerker"" at the end. LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH THAT I EVEN BOUGHT THE SOUNDTRACK...WHICH IS TERRIFIC AS WELL. It brings back all the great scenes of the movie!"
2,Not recommend....,"The movie realistically portrays the relationships in the modern days, which is unconventional to most of the Hollywood love fairy-tales I've seen.Nice for a change.Not mentioning most actors in the film gave solid performace.However it's disgusting to see what the movie is leading us.The movie seems to put emphasis on encouraging couples to jeopardise a health relationship to sneak out and seek for a new partner.What's it going on guys???Was the filmmaker probably initiated into making the filmfrom a past experience similar to the behaviour of the characters in the movie? Or when has immorality of this world become norm rather than exception?In my view, you can safely skip this movie and choose other title,and would most likely turn out to be a better choice than this one."
2,Only for Die-hard Josh fans!!,"I rented out this movie and did like it at first, i cried my eyes out. But when i rented it out again (yes again) I realised that the only reason I liked it was because of Josh, the only reason i cried was because of Josh, in fact Josh was the only good thing about the entire film and the only one who had any acting talent! Exactly what is he doing in a movie so Moronic?!"
4,One Of The Greatest Teen Love Movies!,"I liked this movie so so much. I'm a guy and i have to say that this is one of my favorite movies in the world. This is also definately a chic flick. All u guys out there, i recommend you to go rent, actually forget it, BUY the movie, it'll be worth it, i'm gonna buy it when it comes out. The movie could relate to a lot of people. You'll Love It. TRUST ME."
1,see this film and you'll wish you weren't here on earth,"Here on Earth is so trite and NOT worth seeing. The plot is riddled with endless cliches and the performances and dialogue are hopelessly stilted. It's too bad half-way decent actors were saddled with a script this wretched. Leelee Sobieski's character is annoying and only takes an avid interest in Chris Klein's brat of a character when he takes off his shirt to reveal a perfectly chisled chest. Better movie buys featuring Sobieski, Klein, and Hartnet would be ""Never Been Kissed,"" ""Election,"" and ""Virgin Suicides."""
1,Would give negative stars if possible,"I have read alot of reviews written here that says this movie will appeal to preteen girls. I like to think that even pre-teen girls have more sense than to like this dreck.First there's Harnett playing a slack-jawed yokel. I think the emotion he's trying to convey is his undying love for Sam (Sobieski's character), however, he just comes across as a rather dim bumpkin. Although Chris Klien has an awesome physique, he seems to be capable of only two facial expressions. And Sam (Sobieski) is a typical Mary Sue kind of character with long luxurious blonde hair that looks great regardless of the circumstances and who is nauseatingly sweet and dewy eyed throughout the entire movie. She is simply too good to be true. The writers of this movie should NEVER be allowed to inflict their ""skills"" on the movie going public ever again. The only saving grace I felt toward this movie was that I saw it on TV and did not waste money on a ticket to see it in a theater."
1,Where to begin.....,"What a HORRIBLE, HORRILBLE film! Seeing some of the previews for the movie, I figured I'd watch it to see a nice chick flick. The only reason I didn't stop the movie in the middle was because all the cliche diologue and stage action was much to humorous. Anyone who describes this film as ""moving"" obviously lacks any intelligence."
3,Good Movie! But unbelievable,"The movie was great don't get me wrong. But there was one major problem...a big mistake, which made the movie unbelievable. I don't know why anyone (whether or not this was a movie) would take Chris Klein (American Pie an American Pie 2) over Josh Hartnett (The Virgin Suicides and Pearl Harbor)"
5,Great purchase!,"If you've ever seen A Walk To Remember and liked it, you'll love this movie! It's similar, only way better!"
3,Brought back memories,"Although this movie does no require deep thinking on the part of its viewers,as so many other reveiwers have noted before me...it still has something special. Watching it, I found my heart pounding, just remembering those teenage years of first love and heartbreak. Give it a try. I'm glad I did."
2,A problem with this CD,"To my surprise this is the only CD among a large collection that will not play in my main CD player, a Rotel RCD-06 SE, although it plays in two old boomboxes I have. I took it into Audio Consultants in Evanston IL and they confirmed that it won't play in the Rotel although it will in other modern players.It's a mystery but very disappointing."
3,Not a great dryer,"I bought it as a gift and received feedback that the attachments worked great, but the dryer was basically useless and made your hand tired pushing down the switch to activate the fan. A regular hair dryer worked better. The motor for the attachments were just above tolerable and the multi-speed switch was flaky. Overall, it's just an ""okay"" product, but wouldn't buy it again."
3,Returned It.,Junky product that took up too much space. Dryer was uncomfortable to use and took too long.
3,medium,"If this is the type of dryer you want, it is great. I was wanting a UV Nail Dryer. When I did a search for a UV dryer, this product was listed under my search, so I thought it was a UV Dryer. I was very disappointed when I opened the package and found it was not what I thought it was. It is a lot slower drying than a UV dryer. Otherwise it is okay. I think, if it was what I thought I was getting, I would have been very satisfied, but since it wasn't, I was very disappointed in the product."
2,about 1hr 30min,Actually I expected more than 2hrs' using time after full charge. But the usable time was about 1 hr 30 min. I do not want to recommend this product to other people. You can buy another battery with similar performance at much cheaper price.
5,a gift for a friend,"my friend's father who passed away had writen a track called i'm crazy to love you. she had looked for years for the words so i looked on the internei for a long while till i hit on amazon she plans to play it on mother'day , needless to say there were tears i was glad to be a part in helping them thank you"
1,The politics still linger...,"Dave Johnson spends more time bashing previous authors than he does on the facts of the life of John Ringo. Despite bashing other authors and talking about bias, he is decidedly anti-Earp -- to the point that it dominates the book. In this book he becomes exactly what he criticizes others for being. I expected more..."
2,Hard to get into,At times I found this a very compelling read but for the most part I found this biography to be boring and sometimes confusing. When I finished this book my picture of the subject was still muddled. I found JOHN RINGO: THE GUNFIGHTER WHO NEVER WAS by Jack Burrows to be a vastly superior account of this subject.
5,A transforming work,"Michael Brewer's work is vital for all who are interested in spiritual transformation. The metaphor of carpentry creates a powerful yet open and welcoming context for understanding important aspects of a transforming discipleship. Although it would seem to be primarily a book for men and women who work with their hands, the blend of scholarship and brief, insightful narrative gives this work widespread appeal. This is especially worth noting with its context in mind. It's great strength, I think, is that it creates an approachable environment in which to contemplate the realities of spiritual transformation. No matter what a reader does for a living, the ""Lessons from the Carpenter"" speak deeply, simply, clearly about the power of God's work in our lives. I treasure my copy of this work, as I do Brewer's ""Superhero"" treatise, and I'm thankful for his ministry. ""Lessons"" helps us all see how to live and work in the Kingdom of God."
2,Good for Midi but very little else,"I bought this book as a guide to use Logic for audio post & audio production however the entire book with the exception of a few messy pages deals entirely with the midi side of Logic. This book is perfect for keyboard players who want to compose and set up entire midi enviroments but forget the audio side..Not one page on syncing video to audio!! What gives?? The author is obviously a midi nerd who believes Logic has only one function**MIDI**.The title needs to change to ""USING MIDI WITH LOGIC5"". I have purchased a lot of books on customer ratings so I feel I should warn any potential Logic user looking for an audio reference DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK......."
1,DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE ONE STAR!!!,"EXTREMELY Disgusted that I wasted my money and time on this book. Poorly written and terrible attempt to convey information to the reader. Author repeatedly says what can be done but doesn't go into details of how to achieve the desired action. Sort of like buying a ""How to build a Motorcycle"" book and when you open it up to read it you find these instructions: put an engine in the frame and make sure it has wheels and tires, make sure all the settings are right and it is properly tuned up and start it up. I think anybody could write a ""user's guide"" to logic audio better than this attempt turned out. I wish I could get my money back."
1,"Great Design, Poor Quality","This carafe was initially perfect. The design is attractive and simple, and it fits well in my bag in the mornings. The problem then began that keeping liquids boiling hot would cause it to explode after being jostled in on my morning commute.I attempted to remedy this by cooling my morning coffee or tea in the morning, although I felt this was partially defeating the purpose of bringing in my own coffee or tea. Then it became an issue that the liquid would either leak or shoot out of the carafe after being turned the slightest direction other than straight up. I'd suggest saving yourself the trouble and tea stained clothes by buying a different carafe altogether."
3,Do NOT read this one for Woodiwiss,"Her very short story was not worth the time to read it. Flimsy, contrived, and boring, without interesting characters or a well-defined setting. Perhaps those who have read whatever book these characters come from would appreciate it, but I can't imagine anyone else doing so.Anderson's Old West story was somewhat contrived, but humorous and engaging. It made a nice change of pace for me; I rather enjoyed it. The title's a mystery.Kleypas' story was not her best effort and featured a rather dull hero and an irritating heroine, but the tale was mildly entertaining.The real treat in this set of short stories was Chase's tale of the mad earl. It was populated with vivid characters, realistic settings, a tightly woven plot, and emotional range. Read this book if you read it for this story alone. I'll be finding more by Loretta Chase thanks to this story."
3,A mixed bag -There are better anthologies out there,"I really enjoy reading anthologies. It gives me the opportunity to sample several authors at a time. This one, unfortunately, is not so good. The only reason I gave three stars is due to Chase's The Mad Earl's Bride -an excellent story which saves this anthology. The others are just blah. I've read Kleypas (she's one of my fav's) before and Promises is not her best work. The same could be said for the others. Woodiwiss The Kiss was good but ended very abrubtly.So if you want to read a good anothology get Where's My Hero (Kleypas is excellent in this) and Scottish Brides. They are both really well written romantic historicals."
4,I would say FOUR weddings and MANY kisses !,"I bought this book together with Married at midnight"" in Amsterdam/Holland last May. At the begining I didn't intend to buy it, but when I started reading I knew I had to have it. I have all Woodiwiss's books, but unfortunately here in Slovakia The Kiss"" and Beyond the Kiss"" weren't published and I doubt they ever will be, there is only A season beyond a kiss"" available, so I HAD to buy Three weddings and a kiss"" and Married at midnight"" because of Woodiwiss's stories (and I rate them with 5 stars). But I read another novelle too and I liked Fancy free"" best (5 stars). A mad earl's bride"" was quite difficult for me because of many medical words (I give it 4 stars) and I found Promises"" a bit cliche - but at least it was written in easy English (only 3 stars). I appreciate I bought Three weddings ....."" - I improved my English and finally got Jeff Birmingham's whole story. I recommend to all Woodiwiss's (especially Birmingham) fans."
3,KOKO,BOOK WAS OK WISH THERE E=WAS MORE ON THE WEDDING THAT I WAS INTERSTING IN. IT WAS A SHORT PART TO KEEP YOU HANGING.
3,Three Weddings and a Kiss,I found the book dragging along in certain parts but all in all it was entertaining. Not as good as her previous books.
4,Loretta Chase Saves This Book - No Lie,"In fact, it is a search for other Loretta Chase stories that brought me to this review. All the kudos you've read here for the Mad Earl's Bride are for good reason - it really is THAT good. Truly one of the best stories I have ever read (my favorite heroine EVER). Not your standard romance, which bugged me at first. For the first couple of pages, I was thinking there was some kind of mistake - this didn't belong in a romance novel. Glad I kept reading though - the characters are quirky and endearing but their romance is extraordinary. It's the only romance I've ever re-read!!"
3,Disappointed in Kathleen,"Although this gave me an opportunity to read other authors, I was disappointed in Woodiwiss' work. She sounds tired. I will look for her next piece with greater expectations. If you are a Woodiwiss fan, you may also be disappointed in this short story."
2,Shallow stories,"Good teaser stories, but they are super short and shallow. If you like short stories then this is ok for you."
5,On my KEEPER shelf,As far as I am concerned all of the authors came through with flying colors. It is one I will keep and read again. Love Woodiwiss.
2,Not up to your usual standard,"After reading The Flame and the Flower years ago, you hooked me on reading. I started to read romance novels and could not put them down. I always look for books by yourself as I think you are an exceptional author, although I did not like your last book Three Weddings and a Kiss. It was way to short. I would like to see a further update of Heather and Brandon. I felt like I was swept up in their storyline. Today I still hold my original copy of the book and it continues to be my favorite. I have read it over many, many times. Please continue to write more books. I also liked Shanna very much. It is also one of my favorites"
1,Disappointed,Bought this and in less than a week the microphone quit working. I will be returning it and getting an upgraded model.
2,only lasted 9 months,Bought this system last Christmas. My daughter loved it and treated it extremely well. After about 9 months the CD player just stopped working. CD spins but machine does not recognize that a CD is in.
1,Stopped working after 2nd use,"We bought this for Christmas so we can use it at our New Years Party, we figured it would be fun for the adults and kids. We hooked it up and sang a few songs. The next night I went to hook it up to show the kids how to use it, guess what, it didn't work! It wouldn't spin the CD. I went to return it and they where out of them, the closest place that had them was 45 miles away. I am still waiting for one to come in and if one doesn't I hope they will also take back the 3 opened CD's I bought for it too. Needless to say we didn't get to use it New Years Eve."
3,only good for reference,"This book should only sit in library. Individuals don't have to own it. The article authors, of course, are famous scholars but the price of this book is way too high for personal use."
2,Broken Pieces,I purchased this wine rack in February and still am waiting on replacement pieces for the cracked sides I was originally shipped. I have been unable to assemble the wine rack thus far.
1,This company never responds to problems,"I'm revising my 3 star to 1 star. Not only did the company not respond when I had a question about instructions, once I did begin to assemble this product, one of the pieces was the wrong piece. I did not receive the back of the draw (received 2 fronts) which prevents the drawer from fitting unless I modify it by sawing part of it. Unacceptable since this would be an easy fix if anyone responded to my messages."
2,"you get what you pay for, maybe a little less","After reading other reviews of this product, I had high hopes that I had found a cute, sturdy wine rack for a great price. Well you get what you pay for...the cabinet was hard to put together and feels cheaply made. The screws are well concealed, but it made putting it together a huge pain! It took us well over an hour to secure the ten screws that hold the thing together!!In general the cabinet looks ok, not like a fine peice of furniture by any stretch of the imagination. It is a step below an Ikea purchase. Would be an ok piece to have in a informal bar area, but certainly not a fancy dining room.Don't think I would buy this again."
5,wine cabinet,"Very nice product. It was easy to assemble and yet looks quite sturdy and almost antique-like. It looks nice with other furniture. I especially like the drawer to put corkscrews, openers, etc. I would recommend this product highly."
2,Poor Quality and Parts missing,"I was hesitant to buy this product after reading all the comments but decided my luck and ordered it. It arrived nicely packaged and all the parts seemed to be included, well after spending more than 1 hours putting the screws and assembling the boards that make up the squares to put the bottles discovered that the parts were too big and does not fit the space where they need to be. I had thrown away the box and could not return it. If you are looking for a quality cabinet move on don't waste your money and efforts."
3,Missing Holes,"The product is as advertised, being low price anduseable quality. Manufacturing missed 2 holes for dowel joints that I had to complete, which is a bit frustrating, but it all worked fine with the fixes"
2,"Winsome Wood Wine Cabinet, Walnut",The original mfg packaging for the cabinet is inadequate for shipping. The box appeared to be in tact when it arrived but upon opening there were several pieces that were either dented or scratched. While the instructions are pretty easy to follow we had more than a few problems with assembly either because holes for the pegs were not predrilled and the insertion & tightening of bolts with the provided allen wrench should have been moved up in the assembly steps instead of as specified. After assembled the cabinet wobbled due one of the side panels being produced off set. Not worth the price but also not worth the hassel to return/exchange. I would not buy this again.
5,Wine Cabinet,We needed a wine cabinet to hold our bottles that would fit into a small area. It is by no means small but does the trick and I was able to assemble it by myself in less than 2 hours. Nice product.
4,Great buy,"The reviews for this product made me nervous, but I figured at the low price point I'd take my chances - I wasn't looking for an heirloom in any event. I was pleasantly surprised when it showed up - it's a decent quality, sturdy, and mine is attractive - none of these rough surfaces other people are talking about. It was NOT hard to assemble (although I've spent way too many hours assembling IKEA w/o directions so my bar might be low). There was a tricky moment with bolts in the back of the wine shelves, but it's not a big deal at all. This is a great buy and the drawer is super handy for all those wine gadgets. I'm glad I didn't judge it by its low price."
5,Very interesting album,"It's amazing how such heavy rock songs can sound so good played by a string quartet. I wish it had been played by a full symphonic orchestra but a quartet is still good enough.And being a huge fan of System of a Down, I am very picky. Some songs even sound like Bela Bartok (i.e. Sad statue). SOAD could easily rival with any contemporary classical composer. The songs, played in a classical style reveals all the complexity and melodic ingenuity that might not have been noticed by the ""non-fan"". You won't be disapointed."
2,It's not enough to express SOAD's music,"Musical instruments are Violin(x2), Viola, Cello.It's not enough to express SOAD's music.And their skills cannnot make up for lack of instruments."
5,better than a 1.5 cup chopper,"I am extremely pleased with this product. I had a 1.5 cup chopper that worked ok for very small amounts of food, but things like a large bell pepper, cut into finger sized pieces, would get tangled up and not cycle through the blades. This 3 cup chopped fits a lot more stuff in it's bowl, and so far, has worked perfectly for me. It is much easier to clean than a full sized food processor, and takes up a lot less space. Ideal for making small batches of guacamole, salsa, soup, stir fry, ect. It's noisier than my full sized food processor, but quieter than the cheapp 1.5 cup chopper I bought."
1,Wish I hadn't purchased this!,"Buyer beware and take a very close look at the shape of this chopper. The blades are very small and the cylinger is much too tall. Hence, you get minced product in the bottom area and large chunks on top. I have to shake it to try and get even chopping, but it still doesn't help. I will need to find another with wider blades and better bowl to get the even cuts I like. It may work okay if you are doing 1/2 cup, but you may as well do it by hand if that's all you need."
1,Bah Humbug,"This is supposed to have 2 speeds. Doesn't and so does not work well. Keep having to open it to remove the blade and mix it up. Too much bother! I contacted them and they said to send it to them and they'd fix (?) it for $7.99- sent them an e-mail saying no way. I still have the box, and have only used it twice. At some point, I'm going to have to throw this away!"
3,Recommend for older child,I purchased this book for my 4 year old. The book is clearly meant for older children. I would suggest the age range is more appropriate for 6-8 year olds.
4,I do like this one,"So Mirandy wants to win the ""cakewalk"", a dancing contest. She knows that if she captures Mister Wind she can get him to grant a wish, and that's just what she sets out to do - wish him into dancing with her. There's a very satisfying conclusion here, nothing much to say."
3,The Climb To The Top,"This book is mainly just about the climb from one of the lowest rated, to one of the highest rated TV shows in the US. Not a whole lot of content on the anchors or anything, but very interesting in the way of how the show rose up and became an American TV Icon."
2,A great disappointment,"The good news is this set contains many treasures which were just as good as The Righteous Brothers best-known hits. The bad news is everything has been remixed to such a degree that it no longer sounds like the Righteous Brothers, making it painful to listen to. The songs are so bass-heavy that it's like being parked at a traffic light when a huge SUV pulls up next to you with the volume and bass pumped so loud it shakes windows. A slight cleanup of old analog recordings is fine, but this is blasphemy."
3,Gold - Righteous Brothers,"The discs contain a wide variety of songs including their big hits, but I found my self skipping many of them."
4,"Quick, informative, and spooky.","I cannot begin to count the number of times I checked out this book from my jr. high library back in the day. Eventually I got around to remembering it, and what a pleasure it was to find a simple paperback copy rather than the huge hardbound I dragged home from school. And yet all the information is there, and to that I am more than grateful.What makes this a supurb collection is its expanse. While I'm sure Mr. Cohen couldn't throw all research into this work, what remains is still impressive. He does not go into all detail, but gives the necessary-yet-fascinating summaries of these ghosts, events, etc. It certainly fits the encycledia format, including the handy ""see also"" notes.It can be used as simply a spooky book of ghost stories or as a springboard to more research. Definitely a must-have for those interested in all things supernatural, whether serious or not."
3,"15, Not 25 Languages","I am planning my trip to Turkey and was looking for a menu reader in Turkish. The title on amazon.com claims that it is a menu reader for 25 European languages. In fact, it contains informaiton on 15, not 25 languages and Turkish is not on this list."
5,Very useful,"I used this book as my primary source in an independent study I did in my Junior year of High School, entitled ""Issues in Modern Urban Planning"". It was absolutely indispensable. The case studies and the clear, logical, empirical approach to the matter broadened my perspective of the very real issues facing the modern world tremendously. I cheer Mr. Cullingworth for this fantastic tome."
1,Nothing to see here. Move along.,We bought two of these: one for our daughter and one as a gift for a friend. Both broke in minutes. The orange piece connecting the spike to the sprinkler and the hose is the weak link - completely worthless.
3,Victorian Architecture!,Very good price for additional resource for survey of architecture class. Big fan of the Victorian Era Homes and Architecture.
1,it's cheap in two ways!,i bought this and it was not what i expected! it was so fuzzy! i expected better! it was so bad i could only use it to do little things! do not buy this it is a waste of money!
1,horriable product,"Makes loud noises and can not sign thru it.It is not worth the shipping send it back,lesson learned you get what you pay for."
4,Memorex Wireless Microphone,"I purchased this item from Amazon.com almost two months ago. When it first arrived, I thought it was the wrong model. It wasn't, though. It looks alot different in the picture than it does when you take it out of the box. It is actually a silver color rather than a black color. The receiver is much smaller and is also silver."
4,2 Wireless Mic's together,"This is in response to the question of whether or not you can use 2 microphones together. No you cannot. They are on the same frequency and it causes a lot of feedback. Painful for the ears, but they should definetly make the product so that you can change the frequency and use more than 1 wireless microphone."
2,Limited Usefulness,"Range is EXTREMELY short for this microphone, like 7 feet. If the person blocks the ""line of sight"" to the antenna the range the microphone cuts out. A very disappointing product but it is an inexpensive consumer item, about 1/5 the price of a ""real"" wireless microphone and receiver unit.<br />"
5,So what is to rate? This does the job and I like yellow.,Ordered this cable for use in the home network. There has been no problem with this and Belkin makes good stuff. I would buy this again and recommend it for home use.
4,Lumedyne Battery Pack,"Battery pack works great. [...]Lumedyne ships with an LED readout which is really helpful.Doesn't last as long as I'd expected, but can get through a full day of event shooting where you're shooting around 1500 flashed images absolutely no problem.Happy with purchase."
4,valuable guide,"Especially if you are in a book group that will be discussing ""Possession"", this is a thoughtful, comprehensive guide to that convoluted novel. It will ease the rather daunting task of taking in the nuances of A.M. Byatt's literary romance. Also included is a brief biography of Byatt. Recommended."
4,Mg 217,"This product works great. I've suffered from eczema my whole life and recently started getting very bad psoriasis on my lower legs. This has been the second day using it and already my skin is starting to clear. I'm sure it will take a few more days, but I'm amazed. It is the first product that has given me hope"
5,Best I've found for me.,Hard to find this lotion. Was not available for a while. Unknown why but I've found this MG217 lotion to really work well for me and not create a staining problem with clothes. Not everything works for everybody but you should at least give this a try.
5,Great Movie!!,A friend let me borrow this movie. I loved it so much that I had to buy my own because I know I'll watch it and laugh again & again.
4,Entertaining,"It was an interesting effect to show part of the end of the movie at the beginning, then explain the story. The actors were excellent for the part. Very entertaining. Humor, not gruesome, and unexpected ending."
2,Starts off good but then fizzles,"The movie stars off decent enough with the story off two cons who make a daring escape from prison. They then go on an interstate crime spree robing banks under the moniker ""The Sleepover Bandits"". There are some amusing moments, but as soon as they hook-up with a female accomplice the movie spirals into a tedious love triangle that should have been shortened in my opinion. The ending is clever and it should satisfy, if necsesary fast-foreward to the end."
5,bandits,a very funny movie. billy bob thornton steals the show with his hypochondriac self. bruce willis is the crazy one but he does good. a very good team. cant wait until this title is released on dvd.
2,"""Bandits"" thieves your valuable time","Despite the inclusion of the U2 hit ""Beautiful Day"" in the movie trailer, there is no daylight in this confusing, silly farce of a movie. With the sole exception of Thornton's character, I found no reason to sit through this. Unlikely scenarios collide with plodding scenes to reach an absolutely stoopid ending."
1,A WASTE OF INTELLECT,"Holy Cow was this a bad movie. If you liked epic dumps like Bull Durham or Get Shorty, you might think this horrible film is hysterical. For the rest of us, here goes: the movie is about two bank robbers out for (you guessed it!!) one last crime. Then enters the wacky, indecisive woman that comes between said bank robbers. Comedy is supposed to ensue, but man oh man does it flop. Billy Bob Thornton will look back in repulsion over this one, and Bruce Willis had better character development in ""Blind Date."" As far as the female lead, well, if you just loooove Julliane Moore, this woman is your style. Bandits delivers as many laughs as witnessing an electrocution. I would suggest either version of ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" for anyone looking for a funny AND well written movie along the same lines."
1,zzzz...(snort)...zzzz,"Rare is the movie that manages to make me stop watching before its conclusion, ""Bandits"" however managed the feat quite successfuly. The story was boring, the acting was bland and failed to make me care about any of the characters.Clean your house, go to the gym, read a book, whatever you do it will be a better use of your time than watching this film."
1,Note How many are available used!,"This movie has one funny scene ( the bandits having dinner with the hostage family ) the rest is made up of Bruce WIllis smirking and Billy Bob, the most overrated man in show business , Thorton worrying about being sick. In a word, boring.Dont take my word for it. Do yourself a favor and rent or better yet borrow, before you buy."
1,"""Occasionally forced and flat""? The whole movie's that way","This is a crime story that could only come from the minds of people who spend most of their time in Beverly Hills and Malibu, contemplating how the rest of the world manages to live without the most expensive privileges on earth. Instead of real characters, it gives us itemized lists of neuroses and life issues that never gel into real characters. The humor in the movie, such as at is, derives entirely from these unbelievable quirks.Too bad. Barry Levinson was at one time one of the great creators of unique and memorable characters, such as in Diner, Tin Men, Avalon and Rain Man. The characters on Homicide, the TV show he executive-produced, were vivid and memorable. But this movie's characters are unplayable, and the actors involved cannot make this come to life. Even the usually amazing Cate Blanchett seems lost here. Bad bad movie."
2,so-so,"A light-hearted comedy that I walked out on. Not that it's bad, but it's definitely a chick flick and I wasn't in the mood. Similar to ""Pearl Harbor"" in the sense that two men are fighting over a woman, so women will enjoy that fantasy. Bruce Willis has the same expression on his face the whole time. (Normally he's able to switch between all three of the expressions that he's mastered...all smirks.) Major releases are beginning to get more irritating in the sense that the men are always sheepish dummies and the women are the tough geniuses. Molded straight from the Hollywood cookie-cutter. As far as the title, it's appropriate. The producers are Bandits... They stole my [money]!"
2,"""The worst comedy I've ever seen""","Bandits, to simply put it, is a boring unfunny movie with an Ok cast. The ending is incredibly stupid and the whole concept of the film (robbing a bank) is not in every scene (the love triangle between Bruce Willis, Cate Blanchett, and Billy Bob Thornton) I though it was ridiculous, dreadful, and with not one laugh in the whole movie. Do not buy it. Do not even rent it!"
4,Charming Caper,"Another movie where my best friend and I split. I, too, believe that Cate Blanchett stole this film. Without her, it feels too much like The whole nine yards (comedy-wise) but with Thornton cast in Matthew Perry's slot. Bad hair-pieces aside, Bruce Willis' comedies feels pretty much the same dating all the way back to his Moonlighting days. Thornton gives into his corky side, but Blachette absolutely shines, orange hair and all. Recommended."
4,Good Movie,This is a good movie. It's got a really good sense of humor and some suspense. It really makes you fall in love with the criminals.
4,Bandits,I don't know why this movie did not get a better rating than it did... I found it to be very enjoyable and funny as heck... Billy Bob Thorton was a riot... He had some very funny lines and I liked the friendship between him and Travolta... Travolta puts up with his awfull mistakes and never gives up on him even as a love triangle develops...
2,What's with all the 5 star reviews?,"This movie is really bad... I felt that they tried to throw in a that twist (which I won't ruin it for you if you haven't seen it... even though I would recommend to watch Die Hard 1 again if you want to spend 2 hours...)... well I was mentioning the twist at the end, which felt forced... the movie is told in a nonlinear way... another method to make the story more interesting... so basically what I'm saying here is that the script [is not good]... the actors really do try to save the movie... even though I hated Billy Bob's role... Bruce Willis was so-so... Cate Blanchett stole the show... when we see her cooking hahaha! I don't think I'll ever watch this movie again... The only movies that I've liked from Barry Levinson have been Rain Man (of course) Good Morning, Vietnam (but here it was mostly because of Williams) ... maybe with one more rewrite and a different director, this would have been a very enjoyable experience"
3,"A decent film, but not very memorable","The film deals with two inmates who escape from prison only to resume their life of crime as the ""Sleepover Bandits."" Things get a bit more complicated when a ""desperate housewife"" decides to sign up with them...Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Cate Blanchett, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, carry out their performances very well.Nevertheless, there are quite a few unnecessary flaws with the movie, such as Billy Bob Thornton overdoing it in being neurotic, and the whole love triangle affair, to mention a few.In short, though not a masterpiece, it is a movie worth watching, though you might not want to go as far as purchasing it. 3 Stars"
1,Lame,"First step check out Barry Levinsons other films, and youll see where your heading with this. Essentially this is rainman with a pair of cons, Thornton plays Dustin Hoffmans part almsot exactly, trying a bit too hard in fact.This is a film which is pure 80s, there is no action, and little of anything, in fact imagine rain man all over again.A few comedy wigs do not make a movie, Bruce Willis appears to be on autopilot.If your into Barry Levinsons other movies this is probably your sort of thing, but ill take a real film over star vehicle anyday.Terrible."
1,Don't understand how people can like this one...,"I consider myself a reasonably open-minded person, but I can't grasp how people could actually enjoy this movie. I saw this movie on the plane to South-Africa, and boy, was it boring. It was so boring I had to ask the flight-attendant for a parachute.The acting in this movie is pretty good, as always, but the characters are totally unlikable : one is an annoying hypochondriac, the other is one of those strong and silent types. The script was just BAD, BAD, BAD !!I can't understand why this movie is promoted as a comedy. There were 2 scenes in the whole movie that made me smile. No one as laughing during the entire movie. I think it would have been better it they would have advertised it as a romantic crime-drama."
3,Worthy for the main characters only....,"This film is pretty weak. The plot is very unrealistic as it plays out. What is somewhat entertaining, is Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, & Kate Blanchett. I paid 99 cents for a weekend rental special. It is worth that much, not more."
1,What a waste of time.,"This movie could have been a lot better. There could have been a concise, fast-moving plot, and everything!There wasn't.I laughed TWICE throughout this thing, and both times were thanks to Cate Blanchett: the first, when she was dancing around in her kitchen to 'Holding Out For A Hero'; the second, because one of the wigs she wore in a disguise reminded me of Agent Spalko from Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.The framing device of flashbacks (Bobby Slayton? Really? REALLY?) added too much time, as well as nothing to the 'surprise' ending (who REALLY thought our beloved angry Joe and hypochondriac Terry would get it in the end? C'mon, now).Basically, if you're thinking about renting this, make sure that you have absolutely NOTHING else you want to do with 123 minutes of your life. If I could have given it minus stars, I would have; it gets one for Cate Blanchett (who looks even better with red hair)."
1,a real stinker,watched this Film over the Weekend&thought this Mess won't end soon enough.2 Hours of Cliche Parts&like a Sample of Films I've seen over the past Decade plus.Bruce Willis is just going through the Motions here.Billy Bob Thornton does anything ever change?? outside of the Wigs nothing here was Fresh.this is a Clunker I'd like to forget I even wasted my time seeing.
1,I endured this movie.,"Rarely do I regret watching a movie. This was one of those rare cases. This movie takes two hours for an overly simple plot to develop while having to endure the irritating and extremely campy portrayals of two of the three leading roles. The Terry Collins character tried to come across as a nonchalant, clever, yet paranoid sort of guy, but Thornton's acting was annoying and un-endearing. Blanchett, as 'poor me' Kate Wheeler, wants to claim a sense of pity from the audience, but never manages to pull you in and doesn't seem to be much more that a shallow-thinking ditz. This role was not worthy of her talents and was disappointing to watch. Bruce Willis was the only positive aspect of this movie. His well-known suaveness and coolness were conveyed very well through his character, but it was not enough to save this movie."
3,"Good Start, should have been better","I thought I was going to love this movie after the first 30 minutes. The plot was moving, it was well filmed with fun and interesting characters. Initially, Cate Blanchett's character seemed fun and exciting, but you get tired of her VERY quickly. Eventually, she and Billy Bob's character get a little old and by the end the climax seems a bit underwhelming. Bruce Willis is quite good in this. With a good start, it should have been better. The film really loses energy."
4,"ORIGINAL, CLEVER, QUIRKY COMEDY","Don't listen to the other reviewers. You seldom go wrong with Bruce Willis, especially if Billy Bob and Cate Blanchett are factored into the equation. Actors aside, the multi-layed flashbacks of the script are thrilling and clever, with a doozy scenario of the suavest outlaws you've seen in a while.The romance (triangular, no less) is interesting and the dialogue sports several quotable quips. 75% into the movie, the romance dragged for a 5-6 minutes, but that is forgiveable.Oh, and the soundtrack is marvellous. Get this one as soon as you can."
5,TOPS!,"In brief--one of the flat-out funniest movies ever. All the characters are off the wall, yet with a kind of dead-pan humor that gets you going. I don't agree with the philosohy that it's okay to steal from the wealthy, but still the movie comes across. Just so well brought off! The wonderful ""turn"" at the end will satisfy too. Great laughs. Neurotic, off-beat characters we like anyway!"
3,See what happens when you try to be too clever?,"Perhaps I had the wrong impression of this movie before I viewed it. I was hoping for more of a ""shoot 'em up"" flick, but instead, I ended up with a movie that explores the chemistry between two mismatched bank robbers, a bored housewife, and a wanna be stuntman.This movie tries too hard to be clever. Although the acting is fine, the forced quirkiness gets to be annoying. Billy Bob Thornton's character is just too much. Initially, his babbling on about his various neuroses was mildly amusing, but eventually, it got old. The funniest part of the movie was Cate Blanchett singing Bonnie Tyler's ""A Total Eclipse of the Heart"" while driving wrecklessly in Portland, OR.If it weren't for Ms. Blanchett's fine job of playing a ""bored housewife,"" and the Pacific Northwest scenery, this movie would rate lower."
1,more like blandits............,"I personally did not care for this movie. I couldn't tell if this movie was supposed to be a comedy or drama or action or what there is just no consistency to the plot. A movie with a little of everything is refreshing from time to time, but by the time this 2hour 5minute movie is over you might need to be revived! They are robbing banks and staying at the bank managers houses and stealing cars and just being bad people with attitude. That is the premise of the movie. I mean if you are a die hard (no pun intended) Bruce willis fan that has to have every movie he makes, buy it. Same if you are a Billy Bob fan. Otherwise don't waste your money."
3,Becomes boring towards the end,Interesting comedy with good performances by Bruce Willis and Bili Bob Thornton but mainly by Cate Blanchett. But it drags on in the end making you think about fast forwarding it...
4,Solid comedy -- even funnier the 2nd or 3rd time,"I missed this in the theaters, but my wife, my daughter, and I caught it in a hotel room--and loved it, in spite of the scan-and-pan display and lousy sound. So I rented the DVD, and found the movie even more hilarious than the first time.I suspect those who don't like ""Bandits"" were expecting something entirely different--maybe something more like ""Dog Day Afternoon"". ;-) This ain't it. It's a quirky character comedy that requires a keen mind and a keen wit. Definitely worth the time. ..bruce.."
3,"Some Laughs, and Some Snores...","Bandits has an all-star cast of great actors. So, naturally I thought it would be a great movie, but I was wrong. Bandits was, in a way, very true to it's name, because at some parts it felt like it stole my money. It had it's moments, but most of them were silly. Cate Blanchett was one of only good parts of the movie. Billy Bob Thorton was also funny, but his character kind of got silly, and redundant. Bruce Willis was also funny, but he acted the same way he did in The Whole Nine Yards. The script at times was funny, but it was too long. I found myself looking at my watch a lot. I also felt like I was in a music video with the frequent music montages. Without most of them, the time could have been cut down. But there were some surprises and some funny moments. If you are bored see this movie, it might make you laugh, but it make you even more bored..."
2,Really BORING,I Heard that this was supposed to be a really funny and action packed movie well its no except for maybe 2 secenes it is really boring and lacks a good plot do not buy this it is a waste of money!!!!!!!!!
1,Blech!,"I have seen the dubbed and subtitled versions of Magic Knight Rayearth. And may I say, the dub is terrible! The Music is awful, and the voice actors have no emotion in their voices. Not to mentian that they screech when they speak. If you are going to order Magic Knight Rayearth, go after the subtitled version! I would give this 0/5 stars if I could, but I`ll have to settle with 1/5."
3,To Expensive for What You Get,Wasn't particularly impressed with this product. The odor was just ok. Wouldn't pay that much money for a soap I use daily since this one doesn't last any longer than my usual brand.
5,BEST company,"I've ordered from Plantlife several times. And ALWAYS they send you a free sample of something, they're super fast and everything is wonderful."
2,Not that great,"He's described as a great writer. He's not that interesting to read though, and the reason becomes apparent when the author explains that the reason Cicero is so highly regarded as a writer is that he had a brilliant grasp of upper class and lower class Latin as well as Greek, and switched between the three, sometimes in the same paragraph. Of course all that is lost in translation."
3,A note on the translation,"I don't want to summarize the content here. I only want to talk about Michael Grant's translation.Let's admit one fact: Grant's translation is not that good. I suggest you to check out Cicero's works published by OXFORD WORLD'S CLASSCIS: P.G.Walsh and D.H.Berry are more competent than Grant, and they are fascinating indeed. Grant often unnecessarily chops up a sentence, rendering it ends up with a whole lot of commas, and this utterly destroy the fluency and lucidity of Cicero. In my opinion, D.H.Berry (who published Cicero's DEFENCE SPEECHES) is thus far the best Ciceronian translator.So why is it still worth 3 stars? It is mainly because of the contents, such as AGAINST VERRES, THE SECOND PHILIPIC, and ON OLD AGE, which are still not translated by OXFORD. Therefore, we have no choice but to stick with Grant's translation (unless you want to buy the expensive Loeb edition). If OXFORD will release more of Cicero's titles, I will definitely throw away Michael Grant's."
5,Cicero Selcted Works,"Absolutely superb in all respects, both the main texts and also introduction, footnotes etc. It is a classic and a renowned publication for modern readers."
4,Great Company,The tires are round and run smooth but Niagra Cycles in New York is the best .Great prices Great staff always bring a Smile
3,"Tires didn't mount right, blew off rim","I'm not sure why, but at 50 psi, the tire blew off the rim.I'll try at lower pressure, but the tires are rated for 50-75psi.It may be the wheels I'm using - they have very shallow rims.Addendum:I remounted the tire (with a new tube), and tried 50 psi again. Hasn't blown up yet!"
3,"Worst version of ""Prayer"" to date.","When I saw that ""Prayer of St. Gregory"" was on this CD, and that John Wallace was performing it, I couldn't wait to put it in the CD player. Unfortunately, I should have looked at the running time of ""Prayer"" first. At only 3.5 minutes the piece feels very rushed. Hovhaness himself conducted this piece on a CD that is nearly a minute longer. My favorite version of this song is Tommy Stevens recorded on the Crystal label. Aside from the atrocious tempo of ""Prayer"", the rest of the CD is excellent. Return and Rebuild the Desolate Places is the highlight here, and I would recommend this CD based on it alone."
3,Same old Hovhaness,"If you've heard one Hovhaness, you've heard most. I liked the ""Prayer"", but the symphony gave me nothing really new."
4,Strife in Central America A,"It is always difficult to define the right side in a civil conflict where the Dictator may look ruthless but keeps the country united. The rebels have a higher duty to causes that seem sublime for the poor but no real way to achieve them besides killing the rulers. An American photographer is trapped in the turmoil as enemies, mercenaries, idealists, politicians each fight what they believe is the right reason. In the end very few win and they are the wrong ones."
3,It's entertaining...,"just don't think you're watching history.Two American journalists get caught up in the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua. The cause they sympathize with is a good one, but they let their emotions overcome their professional objectivity. They commit a BIG ethics violation (you might ask, ""do journalists have a code of ethics?""), when they're ""hired"" to take a photograph of the national revolutionary hero who, as far as his supporters around the country know, may or may not be dead. They fall in love with the revolution and each other, their friend and colleague is murdered by Tacho's henchmen, they are chased by the murderous henchmen, but escape, and all ends happily when the Revolution triumphs.One part of the story is based on fact: journalist Bill Stewart was murdered by the Nicaruguan National Guard in 1978, sparking some long-over due non-covert American interest in the Nicaraguan civil war."
3,Not quite as good as all that...,"I wouldn't say that this is really an Oscar calibre movie, but it's good, especially after watching Last Plane Out (a pro-Reagan, pro-Jack Cox piece of propaganda that was only on TV). However, the script goes downhill as the movie comes to a close, and the ending is rather contrived.Your opinions of this movie (especially in comparison with Last Plane Out) will depend mainly on your political affiliation and your opinions of the Nicaraguan goings-on in the late 70s. However, looking at them only as movies, Under Fire comes out way on top."
2,TOKYO JO,"WELL, GREAT ACTING, GREAT MUSIC, GREAT COSTUMES. TO BAD THEY RUINED THE MOVIE BY MAKING IT A PRO MARXIST MOVIE. I HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME ENJOYING A MOVIE IN WHICH THE STARS ARE IN LOVE WITH A MARXIST REVOLUTION."
3,"Great movie, dreadful transfer","This is a wonderful movie, and I strongly recommend it, but DO NOT rely on this dvd transfer to deliver everything that the film has to offer. It looks and sounds terrible. Avoid til Blu-ray arrives."
1,"Student no, military yes","The book is meant for militarypeople! It starts out nice with some courtesyphrases and funny expressions used by people in the streets of bagdad. Later on you can learn ""how to plan an attack"" and finding out how many tanks and what military supplies your enemy got available. Its a sick book that does not deal with any grammar what so ever. If you are planning of going to Iraq to fight a war and do some killing while shouting some iraqui warphrases, this book will suite you just fine."
4,buy this book,"I find this to be the most efficient guitar ""chord"" workbook in its class. After years of struggling with similar books, finally, someone has written a book that not only prepares students to play music in the real word, but allows them to apply what they learn to their ""own thing""."
2,EASYRIDER,"O.K. I'm sure you already know that this is a low budget action film, Cynthia Rothrock stars as the leed character ""China O'Brien"" who's father is the local sheriff, the sheriff is murdered by the bad guys who attempt to take over the local turf, so in retaliation Cynthia runs for sheriff to avenge her fathers untimely death. now is when the action begins, there are outstanding martial arts performances by ""Keith Cooke"" as ""Dakota"" and Richard Norton also did a pretty good job of kicking [...] with the local Utah talent where this was fillmed."
1,Waist of time and money,"I am sorry I purchased this book, from the reviews I thought I was purchasing an informative book on IR therapy. Instead it is a personal account of IR therapy from someone who is not a qualified natural healer, only a perosn who has had IR therapy used on them and liked it enough to purchase a IR lamp and use it themselves. The book is written in the perspective of and to the level of a non-health care proffesional. If you are an individual seeking generalized simple information on what IR therapy is and what it can be used for, you MIGHT find this an interesting book.THIS BOOK IS OF NO VALUE TO A HEALTH CARE PROFFESIONAL WHO IS SEEKING INFORMATION ON THE USE OF AN IR LAMP IN THEIR PRACTICE!"
2,Get to the point!,"I agree, this writer is like a blogger who thinks their life's details are so interesting to everyone but the truth is I just wanted a concise guide on how to use the lamp and what it is good for and any contraindications. testimonials are good too but not a whole book that goes so off-track so often I'm too frustrated to finish reading it!!"
3,Two Piano Music,I heard a performance of some of Bolcom's work. The version on this CD is not as good as the performance I heard and the some of the other selections are pretty weird.
4,"Sony VAIO 17""","I love the big screen for movies and homework, it's a little hard to carry around so I bought a mini-computer, too. The problems caused by the weight and size (need a large, stable space) and the fact that it heats up so quickly have begun to outweigh the fun of the large screen in most instances, but I still like it. The battery only lasts 30-45 minutes without plugging in if you are using Wi-Fi, big drawback."
3,Good product but customer service is atrocious,"I really like the design of this laptop. I have had several before and this is my favorite in design and function. They keyboard is perfect, screen a great size and clarity.I didn't like that it didn't come with back up disks and I had to pay to get them. The jack comes loose a lot too.The computer crashed on me about a year in, just would not work and they had to replace the hard drive.The times I've had to deal with customer service at Sony have been nightmares. That alone would deter me from buying another Sony product. They absolutely do not value their customers.So it's really a wash on this one because I like the actual computer when it's working, but not Sony or customer service. If you don't have to go through them for your warranty work or technical support, then the computer is a good choice."
2,HELP ME AMAZON,I totally agree with Richard D. Unholz. I bought mine from antonline after placing the order with amazon first but they were out of stock. I am now expressing my dissatifaction with antonline since I have been trying to return the product 1 week now and although going through the necessary procedures they still have not sent me the RMA. I phoned them and the sent me back to their website. The pc is missing some key specs from the one I ordered. Guys be careful stay away from this company. You do not want to pay 3000 plus and its not worth it because the company itself ripped you off and they wont even respond to you email. I wish amazon could step in and do something cause all I want is exactly what I paid for or my money back if its out of stock. One would think that the service for a high priced machine would be better. Again guys stay away from antonline.
1,Not what it should be,First time I used it it bent and wouldn't open the bottle to make it easy open! Not worth a dime!
4,Great Helmet For Sesame Street Fans,"My son is not quite 2 and he can comfortaby wear the helmet even though it is recommended for kids who are at least 3 years of age. Overall, the helmet, knee pads, and elbow pads are well designed and attractive. It's a great choice for parents and young children who are fans of Sesame Street.There's one drawback on the knee pads and elbow pads. Although they have a sturdy construction, they will tend to pill at the elastic after normal use."
4,"Good Size, good buy",My daughter recently turned 3 and received a scooter for her birthday so I wanted a helmet and pads for her to wear too. She has a large head so I did a lot of research on Amazon as many of the multi-packs such as this claimed the helmet was on the small side. This is perfect and she loves wearing the entire set as it includes both knee and elbow pads too. The price was also great.
1,For ages 3 and up only,"We ordered these for our twin boys and were surprised when we received them that the age recommendation is for 3 years and up when the Amazon posting says ages 2 to 5 years. So if you are looking for something for a two year old, keep looking."
4,russian house,great movie...shows russian life and living conditions as they are in the real world...been there done that....james
1,Pfeiffer Terrible in this Connery almost as bad,"Impossible to watch, really poor ""high tech"" political non-thriller. Pfeiffer may be the most overrated actress in Hollywood and Connery looks ready for a rest home by now. No action, geeky storyline and this is impossible to watch, just a boring, awful movie. No reason to watch this at all, unless you haven't seen the strange, depressing buildings they have in Russia."
2,Tried to stay awake.......,I never thought I could sleep through a movie with Michelle Pfeiffer in it but I did. First time at the theater and the next time on video.
1,DVD from UK,"The DVD "" the Russia House"" came from the UK and I was not able to view it as it was not to be viewed in the USA according to the info on the DVD. I am returning it for a full refund."
1,Zuh DRAST voo chee,"I couldn't get past the first five minutes of this. Pfeiffer's Russian accent was so horrible, and her lines so bad, I decided to watch Rocky the Flying Squirrel instead, so I could hear Natasha and Boris have an intelligent conversation."
5,"Excellent story, score, setting, & actors","I've had the VHS tape of this for years & I pull it out everyonce in a while to view it again. I bought the DVD as the tape was getting a bit worn. The score sounds even better. I guess that's what really cements this movie together for me is the John Williams score. Recently, I've even bought the CD Sound Track.The world politics has changed, but it's still a damn fine Le Carre novel."
5,The Russia House,"Sean Connery at his best! James Bond takes a backseat to ""Barley""! Jerry Goldsmith music ties it all together beautifully!"
4,A Sean Connery fan,"The Russia House is a typical cold war spy film brought up a notch by the cast. For me, the film was particularily enjoyable for the too few wide shots of locations."
1,boring,"I am not trying to be witty here but this is probably the worse movie I have ever seen. Yes, I am experienced with watching a lot of movies. I have even taken a film class. Now my grade in film is not important and don't ask what it is. The point is...this is the worse movie ever. It's as if the director woke up and took out his bottle and said let me think... No neurons firing! Well if you watch it...do it at your own risk. You are sure to be bored.Or maybe the movie was so good that I missed the plot."
5,You'd think a love story set in the cold war,"might feel a bit dated, but good script and good acting plus nice chemistry between the main characters combine to make the final twists of the plot both surprising and believable .. As they said in the film, ""Honor is due"" and I find the unexpected triumph of a ""merely decent"" man, well worth watching. The VHS version I had of this film, had a more cynical ending leaving Sean Connery's character painting the appartment in Lisbon and hoping. This DVD version, spells out a much more romantic ending which may seem a little schmaltsy, but I prefer it."
4,The Russia House,Great movie. Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer play very convincing parts. It is a very believable story.
3,Charley Chase,"Some good examples of this neglected comedian, who has a pleasing personality and a command of visual gags. An excellent biography is an extra, as well as an ingenious film by Paul Parrott.But my disc was defective, which meant one film was hard to view, and the damage was clear on the disc. UK buyers should beware that they will be subjected to customs and post-office charges for handling over and above what are listed in the Amazon bill that can amount to almost as much as the product."
4,Important guidance for anyone considering wireless data,"This is a terrific book for anyone who is considering an effort to ""mobilize"" their workforce. Lots of great how-to advice on on wireless data can deliver real, quantifiable ROI for any corporation. My company followed the guidelines in this book, and we've increased productivity by enabling any time, any where access to corporate data. We also saved significant dollars on the implementation of our system by following the book's advice on common mistakes to avoid. Highly recommended for both CIOs and CFOs."
2,Selected Poems of T.S. Eliot,"This volume is very thin and poorly printed for the price. There are much better alternatives such as the one by Modern Libraries and the Barnes and Noble Classics edition. They are similarly priced or cheaper, and the print quality is much better."
5,The Politician for all Americans,John Kasich has always been the man who has stood up for the people. He has shown the guts and the temerity to stand up to unpopular issues simply because he believes they are the wrong thing for the government to do. Although many people stop to take credit when something goes well. John Kasich is already working on the next thing on a never ending list. This book should be a must read for anyone considering public service!
3,"Nice, but not original","It's nice to see something make a big splash that simply talks about good old-fashioned values in this increasingly degenerate world. BUT... it's hardly original. LDS church (Mormon) president Gordon B. Hinckley wrote ""Standing For Something"" several years ago with exactly the same premise. And almost exactly the same title. Hmmmmm... Kasich should have done his research first. Granted, as the leader of one of the fastest-growing religious organizations in the world, Hinckley may not be quite as hip, but his points are vastly more inspired than Kasich's."
5,I loved this book,"I lost a relationship to constant bickering. That will never happen again. There are so many tips, so much humor, and so much hope in this book that I know my relationships are safe from now on. If you love your partner and you want to keep her, get this book."
3,Not what I expected,"I thought this was going to enhance an already great marriage, but it's more of a self-help for couples who are having problems. I mean, it's probably great if that's you, but it just wasn't what I thought it was."
4,Dilute when using on cats,"I used this on my longhaired cat. It cleansed and rinsed well, and did not dry out his coat. I followed the directions which said not to dilute the shampoo, and I let it sit on his white legs and feet for one minute (used a timer). After rinsing out the shampoo, I blow dried him and noticed that his feet and legs had a lavender tint. Another bath with liquid dish detergent helped remove the lavender tint, and then he looked very white. The bottom line is that if you are using this on a cat or dog with medium/long hair, you should probably dilute it by adding some of this shampoo to your current non-purple shampoo."
4,Great shampoo.,"Helps remove stains on our show horses. Keeps the white areas looking white. Easy to use, just follow the directions."
5,Great product,I have used this product for years. It works great on my paint horse. He is mostly White and this shampoo makes him so pretty. One of my favourite shampoos to use...a must for anyone with a horse that has any White..
2,Ho hum,"The cover offers ""Blazing passion and thrilling adventure,"" but delivers neither. Ms. Young's reportorial style is as exciting as a two-day old account of a ball game. She fails to develop the characters to the point where the reader cares what happens to either them or the story - which is itself rather improbable. The sex is sterile and devoid of anything approaching passion. I probably expected too much after reading ""Curious Wine,"" ""Claire of the Moon"" and everything Kallmaker has written. My advice: read everything available before turning to ""Forever and the Night."""
4,Enough for the casual fan...but not for me,"A great compilation that collects all of Supertramp's big hits and does a decent job of hitting the highlights of their pre-BREAKFAST era. LADY, RUDY, and DREAMER are all good representations of the band, but like many classic-era bands given the anthology treatment, there are some curious omissions such as HIDE IN YOUR SHELL, POOR BOY, and the excellent FOOL'S OVERTURE. Plus, CRAZY was one of the better tracks from ...FAMOUS LAST WORDS... and is missing here. CRIME..., CRISIS..., and EVEN IN THE QUIETEST MOMENTS still remain essential albums for me even though this compilation makes for some good Sunday morning listening"
5,'Retrospectacle' The Supertramp Anthology,A sensational greatest hits disc. I was disappointed that it did not include 'Another Nervous Wreck' but I bought 'Breakfast in America' and took care of that. 'Sister Moonshine' is classic.
2,Returning it,"I just purchased this model for about $35. For an inexpensive steamer it takes out the wrinkles ok. However, I am returning it because it spatters water everywhere and burned my hand. Not impressed."
4,Too bad about number 7....,"This great mix is tainted by track 7. It's horrible. And at over 7 minutes long, it's the longest track on the CD. I've tried many times to let it grow on me, but every time I listen to this mix I can only bear it for a couple of minutes before I have to skip to the next track. Sad, because the rest is great."
5,Deben escucharlo !!,"Es un cd grandioso, juega con tus emociones de principio a fin, lo recomiendo 100% !!"
3,The master of the oud ... how would one tell?,"Yes the music is that of the great legend himself, Farid El Attrache, but the one thing I really wanted to hear was his taqsims and the prowess that he displays when playing the oud. It covers some of his most known and commercial works but his presence on the Cd is minimal given that it is a tribute CD more than anything else.Some great quality recordings from other artists but if you are a fan of Farid's oud playing you might be a tad disappointed."
2,Nice Looking and Long Lasting but Inconsistent,"I've had this scale for years, and it's still working. I've never had to replace the batteries. The readout is large and easy to read. The problem is that the readings are inconsistent from minute to minute by as much as five pounds. I put a footprint for the scale on a level spot on the bathroom floor with electrical tape, and that's helped. It also seems to be sensitive to where you step on it, i.e., in the center or towards the edges. This scale drives me nuts!!! I've kept it because it looks nice, keeps working, I don't weigh myself that often and I'm cheap. But now that I'm seriously trying to loose some body fat, this scale is destined for in the trash."
3,Great appearance but below average accuracy,"Sometimes this scale will report the same weight from minute to minute. Other times, your weight will vary as much as one to two pounds. Three of us have tried this with the same result and we are not very impressed."
2,Weight Watcher WW42 not accurate,I bought this scale a little over a year ago and thought it worked well at the time. I had put it away and took it out recently to start using again. It is not accurate at all now. My weight flutuates 10 to 15 pounds from day to day - up and down. I'm glad I read the other reviews - I thought I was crazy! I've also had the problem of my weight being different depending which room I was using it in.I'm really disappointed. A scale should last longer then this.
4,Love this scale,"I have to disagree with the bad reviews I have seen thus far. When I started WW 3 years ago, I bought this scale. After I learnt to tap it on the top instead of in the center of the scale, I was ready to go. I love this scale. As far as not receiving accurate measurements, that is so untrue. The only time I have ever received a measurement that seemed off was when I placed the scale on carpet or on an uneven surface. WW does not recommend using this scale on either of those surfaces. I guess one should expect bad reviews from those that fail to read instructions and fail to do research on the product before they buy. I also read, whilst researching this scale, that you should wait a minute after dismounting the scale before you get back on for a new reading. I only gave it four stars because I hate tapping my foot on the readout to get it on instead of tapping in the center."
1,Disappointed,"I chose this scale mostly because of the 10 year warranty it carried. It quit working after about 15 months and when I contacted Conair, the maker, I was told to package it securely and ship it to them...with the recommendation that I insure it. Besides the time and cost associated with that...I must pay $5 for the cost of their replacing it. I'm sure most folks would be like me....it's easier to just trash it. Don't recommend at all."
1,You Should Have a Zero Rate From Which To Choose,Unbelieveable. This product does not work. To have such a reputable name as Weight Watchers associated with it is even more disappointing. My $35 is virtual junk. Bought it as a gift.
1,Not Accurate.,This scale would not adjust and weighed about ten lbs. heavy.Not bad looking. It ended up in the garbage can.
2,I should have heeded the other reviews,"Like another lady, I read the reviews that this scale was inconsistent but I chose to order it anyway, thinking that maybe the ones that were having trouble were doing something wrong. Like not having the scale level, or moving around too much. I should have heeded the other warnings. I can step on the scale, get a reading, and step back on and gain .4 lbs. Today, I weighed myself, went straight to my Weight Watchers meeting (wearing the same clothes) weighed in there and weighed .8 lbs more. Bottom line, the scale is not reliable. I regret buying it."
1,Do not buy this scale,"Don't buy this product. I liked the look and what I thought would be accuracy. Unfortunately, I didn't read some of the earlier reviews and was unpleasantly surprised to note that the scale measurements vary greatly. The variance can be anywhere from ounces to over 15 pounds! Wish I had not bought this product and had to dig out my old $15 scale for my true weight."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was very excited when we bought this scale. I thought it was very accurate in the beginning. However, my husband kept telling me that his weight would change by 5-10 lbs within a minute, 5 minutes, etc..Finally it happened to me and I realized he was right. I got out our old scale that is not digital and weighed myself. I was 5 lbs lighter on that one. To make sure that one was accurate I put my dumb bells on it and it read it exactly, then I added other items just to make sure. SUre enough, our old $10 scale was right. I think most of the digital scales are not going to be very good. I am going to stick with our non-digital scale from here on out. Don't be fooled by the technology and the sleek look."
1,A disappointment,"Like other digital scales, this one is unreliable and doesn't work after a while of use. It doesn't balance correctly and the owner's manual offers no assistance with trouble shooting and fixing. Not worth the money, I'm going back to a manual scale."
5,Great scale!,"I have nothing but raves for the scale! All you do is tap it with your foot and get on. You do have to give it a good tap, but nothing that bad. I've found it to be quite accurate, too. Highly recommend!"
1,It is a piece of junk,"I step on, and it read one number, then I step on again with a cup of soda and it weights the same. So it will not tell me anything unless I gained two lb."
1,Just Don't Do It!,"Please do not buy this scale. I speak from years of experience with it. I do not know why I put up with it's crazy readings for the last 4 years. Every day I would weigh 5 times and all five would be different (within a 5 minute period). Big differences, like 3-4 pounds. I was just trying to get a consistent number. I just ordered an received the Eatsmart that has over 2000 FIVE star reviews. Already love it! Honestly, don't buy this scale. And I usually do not leave product reviews."
1,Doesn't last,"Stopped functioning after 3 years. Permanent message on display: ""Lo"" remains after multiple battery changes. No response from WW regarding problem."
1,very futuristic....looking,"The reason why I paid 50 dollars for this scale was because 1. I thought it looked very cool and 2. I thought for that kind of money I would be getting something very accurate, after all it does weight to the tenth of a pound. I did read the other reviews about its inaccuracy, but chose to ignore them. Don't make the same mistake I did. I can go on and off the scale 10 times in a row and never get the same reading, not even close. I get extreme weights from 130lbs to 155lbs. Last I knew my weight was around 140lbs but I'll NEVER know with this piece of crap. I thought maybe it was just my slight movements that was throwing the numbers off so I weighed objects and still got varied results. But I must say it looks really cool."
2,just for looks,"Although, the Weight Watchers ww42 scale may look nice on your bathroom floor, its measurements are terribly inconsistant.After zeroing the scale and paying close attention to my foot placement, I can get off the scale and back on the same way with almost a 5 pound differance in weight reading."
4,it does a cheap trick to please the customer,"I bought this product base on the great reviews here. Generally, the scale worth the money. When you step many times on the scale, at 15 seconds interval, it will show you exactly the same value. But if you look carefully, you'll see that the second or third time, the final displayed value will switch to the value from first time, probably memorized. If you ask someone to step on the scale in-between, the scale will not show to you such great constantness. The same if you wait few minutes between weights.I would say that it memorizes the first value and if the second or third are close in some tolerance limits, they will be dropped. I would expect to see measured value all the time."
2,Looks Good but is not accurate,"I purchased this scale in January after starting weight watchers on line. I noticed however that depending on where the scale was located I would weigh different amounts, which didn't make any sense. But if I put the scale by the window which is near my stereo, I actually weigh less, than if it's sitting on the other side of the room by the closet. So I initially figured the floors are messed up, but as I moved it throughout the house, I noted the same thing different weights same time of day. So I joined curves to go along with my new life style and found out the scale was totally out of whack by more than 40 pounds!! So I guess this is just going to go in the trash a total waste of money."
1,Bad quality. Don't buy it!,Weight Watchers ww42 looks nice and the measurements are accurate while it lasted (:- About two weeks! Now the air weights 15 pounds +- 10 pounds! Tried to adjust/reset etc but no success. I can't get a fixed reading anymore!
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this scale to keep track of my weight loss and exercise program. This scale does not take an accurate weight. Even if I have just been to the doctor's office, the scale will say that I have gained 10 lbs in a 15 minute drive. Despite reading the manual and following the directions, this scale is next to impossible to program. Maybe I have a defective scale, but based on the other reviews, I doubt it."
1,Weight Watchers Scale,"The scale is awful. It looks great, but works AWFUL. My weight measurements jumped all over a 20 pound range. I got on and off the scale so much I thought I was taking a cardio stress test! The unit itself is a sleek looking piece of equipment though, maybe I can use it as a fancy cutting board or picture frame. Instead of buying this - spend your money on Slim Fast and diet Pepsi... at least they work!"
2,Misleading readings!!,"I must be the incredible growing and shrinking woman because according to this scale, I can lose and gain 10 lbs in a matter of minutes!I gave it 2 stars because the scale itself looks very nice; clean and sleek, but the quality is crappy. Its hugely inaccurate, giving a string of varying readings that vary widely.There is no point to having this scale if your desire is to monitor your weight. It will mislead you!"
5,"Super fast shipping, excellent price. Thanks!!",I can't believe this movie is 20 years old!! It is truly timeless. One of my all time favorites.
2,Wanted more,"Couldn't they have included the often talked about deleted scenes??? I LOVE this movie: its part of my annual opening day celebration. So my rating isn't on that. But I rented this newest version instead of buying and I'm glad I did.The additions to this version don't make it worth upgrading if you already have it on DVD. It was neat to listen to Kevin and Tim giggle through the movie, but I wish they had included the deleted scenes Kevin and Ron talk about."
4,No Bull Here!,"An adult baseball movie with a love triangle to annoy some and to thrill others. Snappy dialogue, good characters (major and supporting) all with the science,philosphy, and religion of baseball in the foreground and background. The film that's one of Kevin Costner's signature roles as an intelligent, macho, aging baseball player is the highlight of the film, also bringing Tim Robbins into the forefront, and lastly, gave Susan Sarandon one of her final ""sexy leading"" performances. Good support performance from Robert Wuhl and from the game of baseball itself . Note: One interesting scene in the film... Kevin Costner's character, Crash Davis states (in one of his witty rants during one of the awkward ""love triangle"" scenes) ""...I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone...!"". A few years later, Kevin Costner plays Jim Garrison in JFK in which this character believes in the conspriracy theory of the John Kennedy assassination."
5,One of the all time great baseball movies,"If you are a baseball fan and have not seen this movie, you may be the only one that hasn't.Buy this for the classic lines.Buy this for the wonderful baseball insightsBuy this for an amazingly sexy performance by Susan Sarandon.And buy this special edition for the commentary from Tim Robbins and Kevin Costner. Both huge baseball fans and obviously friends, it's one of the most enjoyable commentaries I have heard on DVD."
5,i never get tired of it,"It's funny because I'm not a huge baseball fan or anything, but baseball movies tend to rank among my all-time favorites. This is a quirky and entertaining story about minor leaguers, old and young, dreaming of making it to ""the show."" I love the fun they have with player's superstitions, from blessing their bats, to wearing women's underwear, to abstinence. Overall I consider this to be a worthwhile feel-good movie, with a lot of quirky humor and interesting characters. Maybe not appropriate for young kids due to language and adult situations, but all in all I'd say it is pretty mild. For me anyway, this is a movie that I can watch again and again without getting sick of it. Well worth buying in my opinion."
2,Definitely not the greatest sports movie ever,"As a sports lover and someone who is moving to Durham, I could not wait to see this movie. However I found it boring. I cannot fathom why everyone loves it so much. I found the characters sad and one-sided. This one was lost on me."
3,an okay movie,"this is an okay movie. nothing spetacular like, radio or the blind side. this is just your typical baseball movie. if you have not seen this movie then i recommedn you don't."
1,"I admit it, I just don't get this film","I'm going to assume that everyone else knows what they're talking about and that this is a great classic film. Since it is a classic film, I recently watched it and basically it was a big huge yawn. Perhaps I should have watched it when it came out. Perhaps watching it now (2010) makes it look so dated and... 80s. The acting... I mean Tim Robbins is so goofy and unrealistic; it seems more like some highschool production than some highly acclaimed classic movie. My 1 cent worth."
1,A strike out,"Someone recommended this movie to me because we both love baseball. I bought it recently, and after 20 minutes, I turned it off, and put it down where all the ""never again"" DVD's are stashed away.I won't bother to even try and understand how or why it's a baseball movie. I just finished watching Moneyball, and that was a real movie, and a true story about baseball. I've seen Field of Dreams, and that was a great baseball movie and even though it was a fantasy, I liked it. A League of Their Own, yeah, I liked the story, and really liked Bad News Bears. But this was nothing more than a porno film with a baseball background. If you like that kind of stuff, you'll like Bull Durham."
2,Bull Durham dvd,This is a great movie. Even though you may not be a fan of baseball I think you will enjoy it.
1,Wonderful to watch NEVER again !,"THis lousy picture features Costner as an baseball player. If you don't like baseball, skip thismovie right away. If you like it, you'll regret ever renting it (or buying it), because Sarandon and Costner give us a cascade of cliches seldom seen nowadays!"
3,I hate Susan Sarandon,Not one of the best comedies that would be Mr.Adam Sandler are someone this was average at best and she sucks very badly watch other movies this is just alright nothing to special.Acting 8/10 Story 7/10 Direction 3/10 Action 3/10 Entertained 3Overall 24/50 A little Predictable 3 stars
5,Happy Anniversary!,"I purchased this DVD/Bluray combo set as small anniversary gift. It arrived on time and in fantastic condition. The seller did a great job of packaging it in a well protected evelope. I haven't gotten a chance to watch the movies disks yet, but I'm sure they are fine."
2,Blu-Ray: Substellar,"Obviously this movie is one of the all time bests. However, the Blu Ray leaves a lot to be desired. The picture is very grainy, and very minor enhancements (only really color) over the original DVD. As much as I love this movie, I cannot advocate buying the Blu Ray if you already own the SD DVD."
3,Disappointing,"We ordered this thinking it was a baseball movie - it is more about sex & more sex, not so much baseball."
4,it came really fast,It came really fast. it took us a while to watch it but when we did it was a really good movie.
1,What a Waste,"I got this with high hopes. I'd heard the movie mentioned during an interview on a PBS radio show. So, I checked it out as I find watching movies about baseball more interesting than watching baseball. The plot and dialogue are as predictable as the alphabet. It got so I knew what was going to be done and said a full minute before it materialized on the screen. Gag..."
3,Not my favorite by Napoli...,"Knowing that it was Napoli's take on the Hansel and Gretel fairy tale I was really excited to read this book. And, don't get me wrong, ""The Magic Circle"" started off great. Napoli is an amazingly talented author, however, I couldn't help but feel that ""The Magic Circle"" was lacking towards the end of the book. As soon as Hansel and Gretel were introduced into the book, I felt that Napoli was in a rush all the way to the ending. I did not really get a good insight into the caracters of Hansel and Gretel and their relationship with the Witch. In the end, I was just disappointed that a book that started off so amazing could be such a let down. I have not read all of Napoli's books yet, and the neutral feeling for ""The Magic Circle"" will not prevent me from doing so. However, I prefer ""Crazy Jack"" over this particular Napoli work."
4,terrific beauty.,"without ranking among any of my favorites, this book stuck in my memory anyhow, just with napoli's incomparable way of invoking the most appropriately perfect and beautiful images. it's for that if nothing else that i marvel at this book. taken simply as a story, ""the magic circle"" is just that--simple. clear cut, clear point, even the twist arrives with the sharpest warning. but napoli's language turns into heavy gold, thickly incrusted with jewel-images of the raw beauty of pinecones, mica sheets, a daughter, wild gorse. the language is perfect, absolutely. too strong and potent to be wistfully ""lyrical"" it manages at the same time to stay grounded without by not becoming overly sentimental, so that when the old woman tells of her loss, more bitter than self-pitying, it is all the more tragic. the writing makes the book itself as beautiful, definitely worth reading."
5,Good concise source for those in relationship with BPDers.,"I thought it was a very good book, and validated many of my experiences with this. It also provided some insight and advice to help with some of the situations that catch us off guard. Highly recommend as a resource, and is easy to read."
4,very helpful,"A very enlightening book, I wish I would have known about it years ago. Very helpful for figuring out that all our problems wasn't all my fault."
3,Same color and brightness as stock,This product doesnt give purple/white beam as described. Not brighter than stock. The color and beam pattern is not different from stock. Save your money.
4,15.01 including tax at Lowes,"I found this multi-pack at Lowes for 14.16 ... tax brought it to 15.01. One of the few times I've seen a brick and mortar outdo an online price. This appears to be a very small company that manufactures this, however, and their online business charges the maximum possible.The jury is out on whether it actually performs as advertised. We'll see."
4,Realistic,"A frank and very unsettling portrayal of a family's trying to solve the problems of contemporary existence.Although an Iranian film, the situations are universal and apply to everyone.If I had a criticism it woud be that the ending was a let down. After viewing two hours of intense and emotional scenes, at the end, this viewer had to ask, ""What?"".For others it will could be an exercise in making up one's own ending"
4,"Good movie, intense drama","I thought this was a good movie overall. It contains subtitles and very dramatic, but I enjoyed the movie experience."
4,interesting movie,"interesting movie. shows the ""separation"" of the educated/non educated, modern vs. traditional, wealth vs. poor etc etcbut despite all the accolades this movie has received, I have yet to see anyone point out that the whole story revolves around people LYING through their teeth about everything from the very start. If anyone in the story had the guts to tell the truth about anything, it would have saved all the families a lot of trouble.Iranians have lying down to an art form. It is for demonstrating this cultural quirk that this movie should have been recognized.check out this article from the Tehran Review: [...]"
2,A Separation,"Very disappointing - I chose ""language"" English "" - in the beginning some sub-titles then they stop.Then I went back and chose ""English Commentary subtitles"" - again some comments in the beginning. Then nothing.So now I'm looking for a friend from Afganistan who speaks Farsi - so maybe they can enjoy it and I won't feel like I've wastedmy money.That's not very nice, whoever produced this film..."
2,Feeling Separated,"Sorry to say - underwhelmed.Saw this with three close friends - major film buffs all. We all walked out of the theater wondering what me missed - everyone seems to rave about this film, but it didn't connect with any of us.Though we sympathized with many of the characters, their dilemmas were seldom so deeply involving as to rise above typical melodrama with an Iranian spin.Though A Separation won the best foreign film Oscar, I found Bullhead, another nominee, far more rewarding and far more intense.But that's just me.Hoping you find this more enjoyable than I did!"
2,Annoying,"This isn't going to be the most sophisticated-sounding review that you've ever read. From what I say below some of you may judge me as a boorish person, and not someone who actually watches many international movies and enjoys catching the color of different geographic and social landscapes. But I'm going to tell you what I really thought of this movie.""A Separation"" annoyed the crap out of me. People in Iran frequently do STUPID things, in my judgement. Their behavior is quite COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE and to watch it in dramatic form can be a frustrating experience. I have seen movies from Iran that I loved and liked, that brought home universal truths. And I can certainly appreciate a film about people making bad life choices - ""Trees Lounge"" is a favorite, actually. But to me this movie just didn't bring much of anything home, didn't get me to care about its characters, and didn't entertain or enlighten me in any way."
5,exellent,This is a great movie. I recommend this movie to every one. This is not a fact based movie but as an Iranian I know the day to day struggles that take place in Iran. Outstanding...
4,great movie,It was a great movie and i definitely enjoyed it! The ending was terrible though. There should have been a little more to it.
1,Terrible for Introduction To Linear Algebra,"I found this book to be poorly written and inferior to just about every college-level math textbook I've seen thus far. Definitions, theorems and other concepts are poorly distinguished from plain text. The book also lacks detailed examples that are relevant to the exercises presented.Another potential frustration is that it uses completely different notation from other linear algebra text commonly used. Furthermore, the notation itself poorly explained.Essentially, if one is already very familiar with the subject this book may act as a decent, concise, reference. But as a learning tool it fails."
1,This is a Useless Text,"I thought that my department was the only one to use this book since the author is a part of it, but apparently there are at least two other people who have. The text is completely useless to be used as an introduction to linear algebra. A few goodies are contained in it, but they can be found in any other book on linear algebra. I recommend avoiding this book at all costs."
1,I Wouldn't Even Use This Book to Start a Fire,"Lawson's textbook is absolutely terrible. The book provides hardly any examples, and the few examples it does provide make giant leaps in calculations and steps. In addition to the two supplementary manuals to this textbook, Lawson should have another manual devoted solely to apologies for the Math department's monopolistic imposition of this textbook."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"Tulane University math department makes us use this book for Linear Algebra. It was written by one of our professors here, Dr. Lawson.It contains about 1 in every 10 or 20 solutions to the problems. You will have no way of knowing if you're doing anything right. The explanations are sparse, poorly written, difficult to understand. Basically, the book is a hopeless mess, and let me tell you, the solutions manual doesn't help. Dr. Lawson himself doesn't even have all the solutions; if you ask him, all he gives you is the ""Student Solutions Manual"" which has 1 in every 5 answers. Oh, and the book has a huge amount of mistakes and typos, some of which are fixed by the solutions manual.Here at Tulane, math students know this book very well, and NOT A SINGLE STUDENT who has taken the class has ever NOT HATED this book."
1,Worst book in the world,I am a third year Computer Science major at the University of Waterloo. My class had the misfortune of using this book for two linear algebra courses. This is the worst book in the world. The entire book is one long incomprehensible run-on sentence. The definitions make no sense and the notation is alien. This book deserves negative stars.
4,I've always loved it!,"This product is excellent to control sweat. I use it in my shoes, my armpits...everywhere! It's also good for baby's diaper rash."
2,Runs small,This shirt ran very small! If I had not gotten it for a clearance price I would have returned it. The material is nice but buy a size larger than you need.
5,Four Gem Episodes- Archie tries to score undeserved insurance money.,This tape includes these episodes: 1) Oh My Aching Back; 2) The Insurance is Canceled (Archie's home insurance is cancelled at the same time he has to decide who to fire at work) 3)The Elevator Story (Archie's efforts to pay a insurance bill results in his being stuck in an elevator with a wide social range of New Yorkers) & 4) The Locket (Edith loses her locket and Archie wants to cash in by claiming it was stolen.)
4,Live in Sydney,"I love Arlo, live in Syndey and wanted something more recent than the rest of my collection of Arlo records and CDs."
1,Too Much Talking Too Little Music,I asked for this album for Christmas after reading the above reviews. I was so disappointed. The two discs consist of almost all talking. For $21 the listener gets about 25 minutes of song. How many times can a person listen to the same monologues. Quite boring after the first time. Too bad that wasn't emphasized in the professional review at the beginning. Very very unhappy!!!
1,this is a STRUT not a shock!,"according to amazon this is the rear shock absorber for a 2004 nissa xterra, but IT IS NOT! now my car sits at the mechanic until i can figure out what is accurate on amazon. amazon is good on price, GREAT on price but if the part is wrong, what good is getting a deal? out of $1,200.00 (about 40 various auto parts) for my two vehicles that i ordered this week, more than 25% of items are wrong fit due to Amazon's sketchy auto parts 'finder'. very inconvenient, very disappointed."
2,Too many loose ends leftover at the end of the book,I enjoyed the plot line and the mystery kept my attention. But I was very disappointed at the end when I felt like I was left holding the bag. Two people were implicated in the death of the sister and (give me a break) their involment was never explained but left for us to figure out. Instead we were handed a sugar coated fairy tale ending.Who cares who did it as long as the love interest survives?This is my first book by Ms. Hughes. I might give her a second look. But I didn't like the way this one ended.
5,I loved it!,"Okay, so it was stupid that the ""supposed killer"" is chaperoning a high school dance, but I loved it anyways!! Ms. Hughes, give me more!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"Fellow Sailors:Please don't waste your money on this latest book by Van Sant!Let me explain. This book is a MAJOR rehash of Van Sant's earlier ""Gentleman's Guide . . ."" but does not contain nearly as much. If you don't have his Geltleman's Guide, then buy that. Van Sant is VERY knowledgeable and if you can stand for and get by his pompous tone and condescending egocentric attitude(s)telling you how great he is, you will learn a great deal. My trick was to read until I started muttering to him while I read, and then put the book down for a while. I am glad that I bought the earlier book and got through it. I regret buying this one but I thought it would cover new material.Smooth sailing!"
5,Five Stars may not be enough - Great Book!,The author has a wonderfully informative and easy to read style. The book is packed with real golden nuggets of cruising / liveaboard information. Insights into human nature and societies and their application to a cruising lifestyle are unique and valuable.
4,For the hardcore Amy Winehouse fan,"If you really really really like Amy Winehouse than you will enjoy this DVD. You certainly will enjoy it more than ""Amy Winehouse Revving @ 4500 rpm's & justified"" The girl done gone includes interviews with people who have worked with her in the past. What I really liked about it is that it breaks down WHY this lady is such a musical talent."
1,The Girl Done Good......The DVD however sucks,"I like to say Im one of Amy's biggest fans and I have a massive collection of her stuff and when this was released I was so excited about getting it and when I finally did I was very disappointed. Its just a bunch of old british people trying to analyze everything Amy has ever done in fact there arent that many clips of her in the dvd at all. I paid 17.00 dollars for this thing and I wish I would have kept my money because its the worse Amy purchase I have ever bought. If you like watcing a bunch of old people talking in british accents about why ""they"" think she did this and that this is the dvd for you....however unless that sound appealing I wouldnt buy this prodict."
4,very interesting,"I bought this video shortly after Ms. Winehouse died; I believe her talent was incredible, and very timeless. It is documentary, so you don't get long video clips but I found it very enlightening and interesting. I also bought the Frank CD at the same time and it is darn good - can't listen to it when the kids are around though!"
5,Good material,"This material is given by the curators or the people from the music industry, musician, singers, composers and other all of them professionals . They will explains the phenomenon of Amy Winehouse as a singer and compositor. Recommended."
2,stop the yakking,"This would have been such an excellent video except for the overkill talking about Amy, the clips of her singing were so excellent and so very rudely clipped off by the narration that just wouldnt quit. I would love to find a video that is simply Amy singing"
1,May not what you expected.,"The whole things consists of 15 seconds of nice music and talk,15 secconds of music and talk. By variour people saying how great she was. Of couse she was. But it just repeating through out the whole DVD. Not a single complete song or performance. What a disappointment."
3,DVD,I actually did not pay sufficient attention to note that this was a DVD rather than a CD. But interesting none the less.
1,AW,This is not a good buy. A bunch of people I never heard of just talking all the time. Poorly produced and quite boring. Very little music involved.
1,LMMFAO !!!!!!!!,"she had the nerve to get upset over the audience BOOING her lyric forgetting, balance losing, note destroying ''performance''. this person having a recording contract is a mockery of music itself.for the life of me i cant grasp how some people become fads. she lacks everything needed to be a singer. so does dylan,reed,waits,grey,nicks etc.times winding down on her 15 minute clock."
3,Not another Wii knockoff,"This item entered the market before the Wii and the smart shopper who likes one or two of the Wii games but is not really interested in theWiiprice tag can put together a pretty decent system for less than the half the price with some savvy online shopping from Amazon, Ebay, and other sites. It's not a Wii knock-off nor is it intended to be. If you avoid those comparisons in your mind, you'll have a really good time."
1,XaviX Port: ONLY 3 GAMES??!!,"The Xavix port was released in 2004 along with 3 games. Unfortunately, those are even today the only games available for this system.It is said that this system will also have future applications. WRONG!The system alone is $$ and the games are $$!There is absolutely no point why you should buy this system. Sure it's innovative, but the price and the slim selection of games are both aweful. I recommend getting a Playstation 2, Xbox, or Gamecube. 1 out of 5 stars."
5,XAVIX IS FOR SUPER HAPPY FUN TIMES!,HOW FOR HAVING FUN? HA! ALMOST ALWAYS ENJOYS GOOD VIDEO CHEER UP. SPORTING TIME WITH JUMPING CONTESTANT PRIZE ALL! NEVER ALONE IN ALLEY TEAM WAITING BUCKET. OR NET LEAPING FOR SUPER ACTION! HA! HA!
3,XAVIX PORT,"We purchased the Xavix Port from Amazon and it works absolutley fine. We purchased the port for Xavix Bowling and while we love the game, it's difficult to control the direction of the ball and while we feel that we're throwing it straight, sometimes it just flies right into the gutter and it can be very frustrating. However, my boys play it all the time and we're going to probably try Xavix Baseball for Christmas."
1,quit working,this console stopped working after only about 10 times being used for short periods of time. i bought it and several games for grand kids when they visit but they never got to play it even once. now im stuck with a bunch of games and no way to play them unless i buy another console. i will say it seemed like it could be fun when it worked.
5,Small and Fun.,"This system is small and light great invention. The games are challenging to learn but once you get the hang of it, you will have hours of fun with it. Something the whole family can enjoy and it doesn't have all the many different wires and attachments like some other game systems so we can pack it and travel with it."
4,Fun for All Ages,"When we have a party, everyone, yound and old, are gathered around the set playing. We especially love the bowling. There are even some different games, my favorite is this wide bowling lane with pins inching across the screen. It is a real good workout throwing one ball after another to knock all the pins down."
2,Please do not buy this product,"I am not really an online shopper however I wanted a closed shoe rack and the found on amazon the color I was looking for. The product is to be assembled however does not come with proper instructions. So you are left to figure out which part fits where. Also some of the parts had broken edges, faded colors. WE spent almost 3 hrs assembling this product and after that the lower drawer does not close properly. The shoe rack is not even sturdy. Every time you take out something it feels like it will fall off. I checked on amazon site to even return this product however we had already assembled by then and thought that would rather stay on and never repeat this mistake in future."
1,"Not sturdy, small for men's shoes","Fell apart after 6 months - may be suitable for women's or childrens shoes, but not someone with size 12-13 shoes"
3,Super Reader,"This book is a direct descendant of the Hampdenshire Wonder, although in this case the enhanced intelligence is controlled and deliberate.When a very young James Holden's parents are killed, he is left in a different situation to most children in this situation. His clever scientist olds had invented an education machine that leaves him at five with the intellectual development and education of someone in high school, and beyond.Much as Tim does in Children of the Atom he realises he can support himself by writing, and makes a living doing so when eight years old. This is a profession where you do not need to be seen.Eventually he needs an adult front for economic reasons, and he approaches his landlord.However, he can't stay hidden forever, no matter how clever, and unscrupulous types, as well as the government and the judiciary with ambition decide to put his invention to use, while shielding him from harassment, spies, and other such annoyances."
4,A Good Cheap Stroller,"I'd like to start by saying that this is not a stroller for young babies. Young babies need more support than this model can give.This is, however, a good and sometimes great stroller for toddlers and lighter weight preschoolers. It gives them enough support, and more importantly, enough constraint.We bought one for our first child, and then another with our second. Much lighter than a double stroller, mom and dad found the ability to head off in different directions at the store a great feature.The other feature I would like to point out is that it is lightweight to carry. Let's face it, after a certain age, kids don't want to 'sit' all day. They want to run and carry-on until they get so tired that they NEED to sit. We didn't mind toting this stroller about until it was time to use it.Four stars. Very versatile. We've used our first one for four years and have just given both (the first and second) away to the Women's Shelter were they were very welcome."
2,works only on pavement and cement,"This stroller is great for the street, it is light and easy to open. But if you happen to walk into a grocery store, it won't work on tile, the wheels get stuck. It is fine for the price, for just walking around outside, but it does not work on any indoor surfaces and the wheels get stuck a lot. Don't get me wrong, I use mine daily, but find myself shoving it and pushing to get the wheels to line back up. You get what you pay for..."
3,Go for the shade,Stroller is light and easy to use. But...should have thought to buy the one with the shade. We'll be going on vacation at the beach and the shade would have been a terrifice plus.
1,Terrible stroller!,"This stroller has been used very, very little. The front wheels are already locking on it. I was in a crowded mall the other day when this problem started happening and was very, very frustrated. Lucky for me, I got this stroller for free when I spent a certain $ amount at our local Toys R Us. I would recommend spending a little more money and buying a better quality stroller!"
1,Front wheels locking after little use,"We got this stroller as a free offer from Babies'r Us. Af first we were very happy with it, as it was very light and cute as well.However, after only a couple of months of very light use, the front wheels are locking up and we can't use it anymore. Stay away from this. It is amazing that this is actually being sold!!"
3,Easy and Convenient,"I got this stroller as part of a free promotion, so I didn't pay for it. But as far as umbrella strollers go, I think this one is great. It's easy to set up and very light. I am glad that we have our travel system stroller to use with the car seat, but when we just need a light stroller to fit into an already full car, this one is great."
2,Outstanding design,"Kolcraft has done it again. Every time they release a new product I find myself doubting it, but every time they prove me wrong. This time with the larger than life Safari Stroller. My child weighs in at an astoundingly obese 45 pounds at age 2, and this stroller carries him with the ease of Ricky Williams carrying a football. The biggest concern most parents have with strollers today is their safety, both in holding the child properly and the brake system. Luckily for the consumers of this product, Kolcraft has been in cahoots with Toyota and has implemented an anti-lock brake system perfect for the stop-and-go stroller pushing lifestyle of modern America. As if these safety features weren't enough to push you over the edge and order one of these immediately, they've even added a wildebeest laden sun visor so your kid can feel like he's admist a real African safari on those hot summer days."
3,It's ok for being free,Receieved this stroller free when buying other furniture as a deal from the store. The handles were rather low for my husband to push (he's 6ft) and it doesn't steer very easily.
2,"It was free, can't complain about that!","We got this stroller for free after spending $75 at a Toys R Us store. I thought it would be great. Lighter than my Graco (that I love by the way, but too heavy!). Wanted something lighter for my babysitter also.This stroller has only been used a few times for short distance walks, very short distance, just a few blocks! Well, the wheels are already getting stuck. What a PAIN!If you get this stroller for free, great, at least you didn't have to pay for it, but I would not suggest paying the $12 or so dollars for it. I am going to go out and by a Combi, I belive it is for $99, it reclines, has storage, and folds like an umbrella stroller.And for the person who bought the $600 dollar Coach stroller, more power to you! If it works for you great! And, for the comments made about your comment, well, what everybody is writing here is DRAMA! :-)"
2,It's ok,"I ran into T R U on the way to the zoo and grabbed this one. It's kind of chinsy but it worked for the day. I wouldn't rely on it for the day to day grind.As for a previous reviewer he felt it necessary to comment on the review of another by calling their review ""DRAMA"", here's some advice. It's someone's opinion of a product not a personal attack. Addressing it was unnecessary and borderline pathetic."
1,"These are great for people 5'4"" and shorter","Be warned. If you are over 5'4"", you're going to get real tired, real fast pushing this thing around. I was at the mall once, huffing and puffing with this thing and I went into the Coach store and saw an umbrella stroller that was way out of my price range. I put my toddler in it and you would not believe the difference paying $600 more makes!In all seriousness though, you shouldn't have to spend over $600 dollars for a stroller that has handles high enough so no one has to walk around stooped over.My back gives this and all other strollers like it a minus 5 stars."
5,Dependable,I bought this to run a line from the den (where the router is) to the living room so that we could connect our Xbox 360 to the internet without handing over even more money to Microsoft for the wireless adapter. It's been working well for a few years now. Also survived a splice job I had to do when my puppy chewed on it.
2,Not Very Resilient,"This cable worked great and was a great bargain when I purchased it. However, I moved recently and the cable no longer worked when I installed it at my new residence. Granted high tech wiring is a little more touchy than say power cables but I had 100's of feet of CAT-5 survive a dozen moves during college and my roommates and I weren't exactly delicate during install and removal; or better termed ""rip-out"". I would recommend going with a different brand in hopes of getting a different manufacturer and more resilient construction."
4,Working well for streaming video,I bought this cable for hooking up my new Sony Blu-Ray player to the internet. I needed to run a line from my first floor to my basement where I have the Blu-Ray and did not think wireless would work well for streaming video. Cable was of good quality - and I am watching streaming video now.
5,"Hard to review, but very good","Its difficult to review such a simple item, after all...it's a cable. But it does what it says it will do, works well and have not had any problems with it whatsoever."
4,"Reliable cable, wish more colors were available!","Well, you can't really say much about network cables besides mentioning whether it works, connects smoothly at the ends, and provides a good signal transmission, especially if the cable is at least 100ft long.It does all three of the above, but I could not give it 5 stars because of an aesthetic issue - the cable is not white. It is dark gray, and it does not blend well with the wall corners that it travels along from room to room. If there was an available white version at the time that I purchased this I would definitely give it 5 stars!Also, to be honest about the pricing, if you look hard enough online you can find reputable branded CAT6 cables (which has better signal tranmission and more physically durability) for about the same price as this CAT5e one. But since I was ordering this for my dad, and he wanted to use this for his internet TV, it was sufficient for his needs."
5,Works Great,This product worked great. I need to connect a PC up to the router which was on a different level. There is no noticeable singal loss using a 100' cable.
3,classic salsa sound,if you like salsa-like my wife - yuo'll love this one. very good singer and composer.
5,a thought provoking book filled with inspiring words of love,"I first saw Iyanla Vanzant on Oprah (another truly inspiring woman) the more I watched this exceptional women the more I was astounded by her life and work. I looked up her books on the internet and read the excepts from each. These excepts were not lenghty but in that time I found a need in myself to discover more. The short excepts made real sense to me. So I went and purchased the book 'Faith in the Valley'. It made me wake up at night and listen to my thoughts that were deep in my stomach and not only to listen but to take notice of them, good and bad. To listen to faith that for so many years I had simply let into the fringes of my life and never into the core. Iyanla Vanzant is thought provoking, inspirational and gifted. I have all her books now. She is a writer and teacher that would inspire Mother Teresa."
5,Read this book and read it often,"This is the most inspiring, soul-revealing, soothing, book I have ever read. I carry it with me and read special passages as peaceful reminders to my spirit. Iyanla's words are constant gifts, a quiet voice that shouts at your heart, ""I am the best me I can be today!"""
5,Inspirational,"Faith In The valley by Iyanla Vanzant is truly a book to help us on our journey toward peace. Ms. Vanzant imparts words of wisdom and encouragement. She is reminding us of some of the day to day things we take for granted. We sometimes forget to be thankful for what we have; good health, a job and a place to live. You will not regret reading this book. As Ms. vanzant writes, ""What a blessing! I am so thankful"" that I read this book. Go get yourself a copy of ""Faith in The valley""."
3,Satisfactory,"I received book quickly and in good condition. However, it is a used book and there is a message to previous owner written on inside of front cover. If I had known that I might not have purchased. I can not give away to another now."
5,Very enlightening,"My wife suggested to me I should read this book, although I was a little apprehensive about it. So I did and coming from a males perspective I would say Sister Vanzant has open my eyes to a lot things I was doing. For example instead of ""being"" I was ""doing"" and now I'm starting to ""become"". I'm starting to listen to my inner self because it talks to me all day every day, and when you are able to listen you are on your way to recovery."
5,Change Your Life...,"This is one of the greatest life changing books I have ever read. Have given it in paperback to over 10 people who told me their lives too have changed for the better. It is like having a ""mother"" speak to you and remind you what your true purpose in life should be when you fall down--it teaches you to get back up.The world today is full of so many problems--I found this book in a self-help section of a book store many years ago. Iyanla Vanzant changed my life and when you lose your way--those words hit home.I taught from this book for many years, I helped a lot of people get through their toughest challenges in life. They changed their lives by changing their minds, their directions and realized that the path they were taking was not bringing them the power they so desired.I would also recommend ""Acts of Faith""."
1,Ordered but Not Received,To date I have not received this book and so cannot rate the product.Since it was intended as a gift I am disappointed that I have not received it nor given it to the person it was intended for. I had to place a rating because I could not submit the review without doing so. The rating is undeserved.
3,"Is just, OK",Beautiful product but that is it. Pressure is poor! Coverage is thorough and gentle. I wanted the best of both. Disappointed. PR
2,doesnt fit!,i got this shower head and guess what it doesnt fit nice i payed 40$ for a shower head i cant return
1,Poor Quality - avoid,It broke loose after only 3 days and almost smashed my foot. The heavy shower head is inadequately suspended from a thin and flimsy nozzle. This is cheap junk from China. Stay away.
4,"Good, but still not my favorite.","This showerhead is beautifully made, and boasts a nice wide shower head. The water flow is very pleasant, wide, and soft. It comes with a good S-shaped extension pipe. It even has a nice sound when water flows through it. The Pollenex is my second favorite showerhead.My favorite is the Deluge Country Club Shower head. That one is cheaply made and kind of cheesy looking. But the water flow is awesome. It provides a soft, drenching, gentle, high flow shower. It is like standing out in a warm rain on a tropical island. It also has an extension arm that adjusts it beautifully for us tall folks.I have decided to give my Pollenex to Goodwill, and go back to the Deluge Country Club."
1,Leaking from the sides,Its a very poorly made product. Water is leaking from the sides and is getting worse day by day. Wish I had gone for a better brand and NOT conair!
4,Overall pretty good refreshing shower with elegant look,"Overall pretty satified with the shower, looks elegant...andgives you a nice and refreshing shower. Although if you are looking for a power wash then this is not for you. its more like a steady stream of water pouring down...."
4,wrap yourself in warm water,this showerhead is extremely large and has a gignourmous coverage area which is awesome. you do lose a little water pressure but the coverage is well worth the loss
2,Nice but no water pressure,It looks nice and if you like a trickle of water (more like a sprinkle than a shower) then you will like this. I dont and uninstalled it after a week. It would have been nice if the product specs mentioned there is no water pressure. Even taking it apart and drilling more holes in it didnt help much.
3,NEED TO DRINK MORE,THIS IS THE REAL DEAL IT WAS RECOMMENDED BY A DOCTOR AND I TRIED IT ITS NOT THE BEST TASTED WHEN STEEP TO LONG BUT I CAN CONTINUE DRINKING
2,Illumination but overdone,"Before reading this book, I had no idea what Phillip Pullman's personal positions on faith and religion were and that was pretty much what this book was about -- variations on the theme of ""Phillip Pullman wrote this series as a rebuttal to C.S. Lewis and Christianity"". I picked this book up because I had so enjoyed Pullman books and had found the previous ""Smart Pop"" series books I had read so enlightening and mentally stimulating. Unfortunately, this one did not reach that same level of interest. I found the majority of the essays to be rather simplistic and very little of what I read made me think. It was illuminating to hear the underlying philosophy that Pullman brought to his writing, but I would have liked it if they essayists had not all addressed this same topic but had instead looked at other aspects of the books"
3,Simple.,"This compilation of essays on His Dark Materials is simple, at times comical, and an easy read for those who want to know just that little bit more after having read the series. Don DeBrandt's ""His Dark Pharmaceuticals"" is perhaps the most imaginative responses to the series and quiet the laugh! However, if you are look for a textual analysis or an in depth insight into the series, then this is not the book for you."
1,Very poor,"I would not recommend these scales. The weight reported is never the same, even if you use it twice in five minutes. I've only once managed to get my feet in just the right spot to get the body fat and bmi functions to work. All other times I simply get 'Err'. Don't waste your time or money with these scales."
2,"Easy to program, not accurate.","I was very happy that it was so easy to program, but after I used it a couple of times I discovered that it is not at all accurate! I can weigh myself one minute, step off, and reweigh and it will give me a completely different weight, usually a two pound difference. This does not give me much confidence that any weight I receive on it is accurate. Very disappointed."
1,Worst product I have ever received from Amazon,DO NOT BUY this Item! Weighed myself 25 times and got a different weight each time. Had a difference of 5 pounds several times. Should not get one star but that is as low as you can choose.
5,Jan from Illinois,Love this scale! I have taken it to my aerobics class and am sharing it with friends. We are tracking our progress with our weight loss and % body fat goals. It is easy to use and appears to be quite accurate. Great product!
2,does not work,"I purchased this scale, & it did work fine for the first month or so, but now I have no idea of my correct weight, it gives me a different reading every time,within minutes of each other.And the difference is usually a 5 lb range. I definitely do not recommend that you purchase this."
2,Has issues,"When I first ordered this scale, it would not turn on at all (and battery was in place). I returned it and got another one which did turn on, but the body fat % feature does not work at all, it keeps returning me ""Err"". So all it does is measure my weight, which my old scale did already, so it was a waste of money for me. It sounds like different people have different luck with these."
3,Beware of images and shipping,"When I received the bathroom scale, I was disappointed. The picture makes the scale seem that it's made of metal, and a silver finish. I got a white plastic scale that looks like it cost $20. It works great, I was able to easily input two people's information quite easily. I'm also upset because I ordered the scale two days ago, and NOW they decide to have a sale! Shipping irritated me too, I ordered next day. The bathroom scale I received next day, but the kitchen food scale I received two days later. <br /><br />Personally, this is not my choice product, I like my old WW glass scale a lot better, even if it didn't show the body fat and water percentages."
5,easy fix,"The dealer quoted me around $500 to relocate my purge valve, so I did a quick internet search and found the exact replacement part for under $20 including shipping. It was a 15 minute job and fixed my problem."
2,Mediocre,"There is nothing new or memorable in this book--no depth to the characters. It went directly into my discard pile. To be fair, I had just finished Rosemary Kirstein's ""Steerswoman"" series; and there is just no comparison. Otherwise, I might have given it 3 stars."
4,A good Gould addition,"I am glad that these two works appear together on the same CD. They balance each other so beautifully. The ""Variations"" is a wonderful Gould piece that is too often overlooked. My big criticism here is that both pieces are played a little too carefully and lack the fire that Gould intended. The Nashville Symphony is an excellent orchestra, but is better represented by their new conductor as opposed to Schermerhorn."
3,never got it but wanted to,"I have a copy of a partial recording of Fall River Legend and got a tape of the variations but as for the Disc of Mr. Gould's works, never got it, but wanted it."
4,"More From Mr. Malkmus, Please.","Hmm, Some people may question whether or not the rest of the world needs to hear from this ""Dude"" Stephen Malkmus again. Well, for those of us who are fortunate enough to possess musical taste, the answer to that question is a big, fat, resounding YES!The world needs to hear more from Stephen Malkmus, and much less from wanna-be critics (failed musicians, perhaps?) who can only muster sarcastic ""Whoop Dee-Doo's"" as their feeble attempt at writing an actual review.Perhaps those who don't agree with me that this album contains some truly inspired, adventurous music should move to Portland and play blues in a lousy bar band.WHOOP-DEE-DOO, INDEED!"
4,"More music, less talk please.","Yea I got it that more people showed than were planed for and it stormed, but everybody stayed cool and it was a beautiful and groovy scene, man. I suppose it was important at the time establish the social context of the festival. But by the time I knew much about music these acts were dead, had dropped off the radar, or were main stream pop rock bands, so I would like to have seen them when they were still ""changing the world""."
4,UNIQUE,"THE ABNAKIS & THEIR HISTORY by Eugene Vetromile, S.J., is an esoteric and unique book. A short work (171 pp.), it offers extremely valuable information on the Indians of the Northeast, Abnaki language, writing, customs, and religion, the character of the Indians and, finally, a plea for righting injustices committed against them. Written in 1866, this very scholarly work was reprinted in 1976 and is not easy to come by. For anyone interested in the Abnakis, the Penobscots, the Passamaquoddies, the Maliseets, and the Micmacs, this is a must. One cannot help but be impressed by the erudition of the author-- a man of unusual intellectual gifts and broad interests, as a glance at other titles by him would confirm. The book also has some quaint period engravings. Although scholarly, the book is eminently readable."
2,disappointed,Loved the glick show....this is poorly written and not funny. Wow what a disappointment.
2,Up and down,"When it comes to humor Jiminy Glick is up and down. Glick isnt really funny, instead John Michael Higgins' eurojerk character provides most of the laughs. The outtakes at the end are also great. If you give this movie a chance, you'll get some laughs (not many though)"
1,Jiminy Glick,This movie sucks! It is so stupid. We got it for our Kiefer Sutherland collection but will probably get rid of it. We couldn't even watch it all the way through. We will probably give it away. I do not recommend watching or buying this video.
3,So disappointing :-(,"I was so looking forward to this. I love Martin Short and I love Jiminy. But this was almost torturous to watch. It had it's good moments, but it had an equal amount of bad moments too. Dixie was not how I had imagined her and neither were the boys. The interviews were about the only highlights. I loved the Kurt Russell interview. That was great (and just before the credits roll, there are some outtakes where Kurt is doubled up in laughter - that was funny). I'm sorry if you don't agree with this review but I'm only being honest and I am a true Martin Short fan. If I had a choice, I'd just rent this instead of purchasing it."
3,It's okay,I bought this movie because it was inexpensive and I heard Martin Short's impression of David Lynch was hilarious. It was.
3,Good old 80s flick,Great acting performances but with an medioka story line good live set locations and plenty of action if thats what you want you will like this film.
1,Pretty Worthless,"I bought this unit at Target for a special birthday party. After two songs it quit working properly. Most people keep saying its the microphone. I find that the microphones were fine, since I got two of them when I bought the unit. It is the unit that does not work once it gets warm. This unit should be recalled by Memorex because it does not work and has ruined many people's plans for good fun. I strongly urge people not to buy this product because of the frustration it causes when you need it. Target was good enough to receive it back along with the extra microphone I got with it."
1,This system leaves much to be desired,I bought this system for my 6 year old son for Christmas. It worked for a few minutes and looked to be a descent investment. After a couple of uses the microphone developed a short and all you could hear was the crackling of the microphone. Target didn't have another machine in the entire metroplex for exchange or a microphone that would work. The system was disappointing and so was my experience with Target's service staff.
1,Don't waste your money!,"This machine is TERRIBLE. The instructions are messed up - they DO NOT tell you how to start/connect the system...but it gives you &amp;amp;quot;optional&amp;amp;quot; connection instructions if you want to hook it up to your TV instead of using the mini screen on the actual machine. The words didn't appeared on the screen, so I called the customer service at Memorex. They couldn't figure out why it didn't work, finally said that the monitor itself is probably defective and that I should return in to the store. When I return it, I will upgrade to a better system because the speakers on this are bad - sounds like you are in a tin can. Really, I can't say anything good except for the sale price when I got it ($38.00 or so)."
4,family fun,"We have been very pleased with this purchase. We did not experience any of the problems the other reviewer reported. Obviously hers was defective. My 6 year old grand daughter had no problem operating the unit. We have used it non-stop and loved every musical minute. It is easy to set up, easy to operate and easy to store! Big thumbs up!"
3,not a bad book :missed the main original characters,"I found this book to be not bad, though it was no way as good as the original. I was disappointed that the main characters like Catherine didn't appear in it. But as Northhanger abbey is my favourite Jane Austen story I am disappointed that of all the sequels written, only one has been written about it.I found the book interesting, though lacking a serious plot, though I did find the ending fitting. All in all, I found this book not bad and I guess its up to you as to whether you buy it. I'm glad I did but only give the book a 3."
5,This Edgar A. Poe audiobook is great!,"A great story. Good poems! Like Cliff notes, just very, very hip. Very very spooky. It helped me and my friends to understand Edgar's poems and stories for a class at school."
5,A classic tale of Edgar Allan Poe.,"Out there, in the darkness of his tortured life-Edgar, with his dreams and nightmares, his exposure to the night. How he must have suffered for his sanity and his art. How he must have suffered for his love, Lenore.-Lo, Tis a gala night. Within the lonesome latter years.""Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. This writer has reincarnated Poe in a sparkling way. The stories, the poems. My friends and I have lit candles, drank cognac and looked out the window at the rain-and listened to this wonderful tribute to Poe. It will take all listeners back into time. Bravo!"
5,A very David Lynch/Pink Floydish type take on Poe,"I am working on a paper about Edgar Allan Poe and I found this audiobook to be freakishly-fun and 'out there'! My friends and I have loved Poes works since we were kids in Baltimore. We mixed up these tapes and found out there was no real beginning or end to this tragic love story between Edgar and Lenore. This story is like a painting where instead of seeing new things or shapes in the colors at day or night, you hear things."
5,"A sad,yet beautiful story of Edgar and Lenore.",I never realized Edgar Allan Poe and other writers of the past had so many problems. I am fourteen years old and my girlfriends are using this tape for our book reports on American writers and poets. We like the Raven and the Tell Tale Heart. Although I wouldn't reccomend some of this tape to younger kids. I think this would be like a PG-13 kind of story. Anyways. This was a great story and I am sharing this tape with other friends at school and my dad is buying an extra tape for our school because we don't have one in our library.
5,Edgar's love story is beautiful,"Simple fingerprints of a child with colors of the seasons, taking you into a timeless love story. I sat on my porch swing and listened to this Edgar Allan Poe love story and listened to the rain, and the ravens, and the day, and the night; and I came back to look at the stars. We sometimes forget these things. This is truely a beautiful aubiobook."
1,A response to Chevy Chase reviewer.,"For the benefit of the Jan 2002 reviewer from Chevy Chase---I am the reviewer from Washington, DC. While I am a graduate of Exeter, I am not a former headmaster. And I continue to believe that the Levy work remains deeply flawed, largely for the reasons stated in my previous review."
5,Alexandra Holden!...,"Yep, Alexandra Holden is beautiful! However, she's not the only reason to watch WISHCRAFT. The story is great, with many unexpected twists and gruesome turns. There's a lot going on that only makes sense at the end, and what an ending it is! Basic story: Highschool brainiac, Brett Bumpers (Michael Weston) pines for beauty queen / cheerleader, Samantha (Holden). One day, Brett receives a mysterious package containing a mummified bull's -(insert favorite euphamism here)-, which grants him 3 wishes. Brett makes his first wish, setting in motion a series of macabre, even murderous events. I was expecting just another SCREAM-ish formula movie, but instead, WISHCRAFT is unique and engrossing. Own this one now!..."
1,*yawn*,"it's bored the daylights out of me. i never even finished watching it. kept falling asleep. i'd recommend renting, before buying."
1,Disappointing,"I've seen tinker toy men that looked more realistic. And they are hinged in so few places, there is not much to do, except stack them. Which gets old very quickly."
3,smaller than I thought,"I bought this toy as a desk filler at work, I thought this toy had more joints and was bigger in the photo, its really small and limited on creative movements."
4,Pvr 350,"I put this card in a Mythbuntu box. Overall the picture and sound are good, I can't really vouch for the included software. I installed it on my Win2K partition to test the card but I haven't really used it. It took a little bit to get everything in Mythtv configured for the first time but when I redid the installation for a bigger HD it only took about 1-2.5 hrs. For Ubuntu 8.04 the hardware drivers (ivtv) are already included in the kernel so it was basically plug and play. Also the remote is supported with LIRC. I had to select the remote type during installation of Mythbuntu and it took care the configuration. Overall, I'm fairly pleased with this card."
3,great card - but has bug with audio,"This card should be a 4 or 5 out of 5, but it records audio at such a high volume that its cracking. When I play back DVD's I have to set the volume on the TV to 2 or 3 when I usually have it set to 7. Fortunately, I found a fix on the web. You have to edit your registry. I did not get this info from the mfg web site. They are well aware of this problem, yet the latest driver date is 9/05. The alternative is to reduce the level going in - but you dont always have control of audio out of DVR's etc. Also, I occasionally experience jitter from their WinTV2000 app. The state its due to my motherboards VIA chipset - some flaw when recording to the HD."
5,Software is usless but I don't use windows anyway,"I built a nice pvr with this. A 566mhz 256mb SDRAM, 120 gb box. Running Red Hat linux 9. I use Mythtv as the software. Runs fine. Someone complained about how the drivers are messed up and the software won't work. Well mabey it because you use windows ;). Ditch it. It's good for nothing. The only reason you should be using it is if you play a lot of games. Even then Winex can play windows games well.Anyway, it has on-board mpeg-2 encodeing which comes in handy on slow machines. And has RCA and s-video out to watch all your recorded stuff on the tv."
5,PVR350 + GBPVR software = FREE-VO!,"If you like the idea of TIVO, enjoy to tinker with the software setup, and would like a project you can finish in a day, get this card. I've been running this card for about two months now as a successful personal video recorder. Never missed a show, and found a couple of things that I now watch all the time. Great card, can be a bit buggy on the software side, but if you can handle the tinkering, awesome! check out www.gbpvr.com"
2,No drivers for Windows x64 Editions,"If you are a sophisticated Windows user such as myself and are using one of its x64 Editions, you will be disappointed to know that as of the time of this review, no drivers are available either online or offline to get this product to work with Windows x64 Editions. Users have been requesting Hauppauge for these drivers for over a year now, but apparently this isn't a priority for Hauppauge. A call to Hauppauge indicated that they will be available no sooner than late summer 2006, although in reality I would not be surprised if that is delayed to early 2007 instead.Of course, there are alternatives such as the PowerColor Theater 550 Pro that support the x64 Editions right now."
1,Jerky frame capture,"This card didn't work form e. The picture captured moves in frames. Although my computer is configured according to the specs required for the Hauppage PVR 350, this card did not work for me. I wouldn't suggest any one to buy this. I would recommend a stand alone DVD recorder which works perfectly for recording to digital format. I bought the Panasonic DVD 30S. It works perfectly for me."
3,Don't buy for TV-OUT on your PVR.,"I bought this card for the TV-OUT while building my PVR. I haven't decided on MythTV, SageTV, or BeyondTV. The mpeg tv-out decoder on this card has GREAT quality, however since it is hardware, it only plays MPEG2. The apps i mentioned all have portals to YouTube or Google Video, so you won't be able to watch that stuff. I also have content in divx or xvid format that i can't watch. Also all the apps i mentioned seem to have dropped support for tv-out on this card because of driver problems and the other issues mentioned.It is a great card if you will only watch the mpeg2 content it records. If you don't need the tv-out, just get a PVR-250 and a video card with decent S-Video out. That's what I'm doing."
3,350,"Make sure that the drivers exist for the card you want before purchasing. This card has no Vista 64bit drivers.Strangely the 150 is a better card than the 350, who knew!?Beyond that - it works and I get a decent picture on my PC. Look for an HD TV turner if you're shopping for a tuner."
3,RF problems with 350 tuner card,"I purchased the 350 a month ago. There is severe RF interference on some higher numbered channels (channels 66, 69, 70, 71,72) only when the FM antenna is plugged into the card - these channels are not viewable. Removal of FM antenna returns the affected TV channels to good quality. I have had many email exchanges with Hauppauge technical support and after a month of trying different things, they are finally going to set up an RMA for the card. It is not yet determined if it is defective or a bad design. I was hoping to have it ready for season 3 of Nip-Tuck. I'm not too happy that is has taken this long to get to this point."
1,Didn't Work,"I'm the kind of guy who reformats and reinstalls windows once a year, so that my PC will be faster. So, I'm not afraid of doing things to my PC. I was not able to get the Haupauge-PVR-350 to work. I read through all of Haupauge's FAQ's, I updated drivers, reinstalled drivers, and generally messed around with the application.If something is a little tricky, but I can barely get it to work, it follows that it will be way too cumbersome for my wife. The main reason I bought the PVR was so that that she could record stuff.Maybe I just got a 'bad' unit, but it was enough to make me pack it up and return it. More user-friendly installation please."
2,No drivers for other software,"Very disappointed with this purchase. Their Tech Support was pretty good although they couldn't help with drivers for other software. I wanted to capture some old VHS tapes. The capture software supplied was poor, I had other capture software, but none would work with this card because Hauppuage doesn't have any drivers for other capture software .I had many other problems while trying to capture. If I changed to full screen while capturing the software would change channels!I returned the card for a refund and I am looking at other cards."
1,Software and Hardware HORRIBLE!!!!,"First off the Software is Horrible!! I have XP Media Center and the Win2000 interface program won't even run. The hardware drivers interfere with other programs on my computer; Now my Cineplayer has no sound and when i double click on my speaker icon in my tray, an error message comes up saying I have no active mixer devices available. I spent hours trying to resolve and my computer is still messed up.The remote is useless, I will have to get a Microsoft remote, and the picture quality using Media Center is POOR at best.Save your money and AVOID this item.IF YOU HAVE TO TRY IT, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND INSTALLING NORTON GOBACK OR SIMILAR SOFTWARE TO UNDO THE PROBLEMS YOU WILL HAVE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!"
3,Read carefully,Does not support composite input. What a POS. If you are going to spend this kind of money you might as well get the 550 or look at the plextor PX-TV402U. Good if you want to watch TV but for some serious capturing I would recommend looking else where.
3,Getting there.,"Not bad, could be better. As for switching to Linux - yeah, right. You're talking about consumers here, some of them have problems with Macs for god's sake. Linux has a long way to being user friendly."
1,Jerky frame capture,"This card didn't work for me. The picture captured moves in frames. Although my computer is configured according to the specs required for the Hauppage PVR 350, this card did not work for me. I wouldn't suggest any one to buy this card. I would recommend a stand alone DVD recorder which works perfectly for recording to digital format. I bought the Panasonic DVD 30S. It works like a dream!"
3,Synchronization Problems,"For TV, this card works fairly well, but the software does crash.I also use this card to convert old VHS tapes to DVD. It makes great quality transfers, but the audio and video become unsynchronized as the mpegs become longer. After about 45 minutes, the are noticeably off. Also, the supplied adapter to input from an RCA source has a female end for the 1/8"" stereo plug. The input on the card is also 1/8"" female, so you will need to purchase and additional 1/8"" male to male stereo cable to use the supplied adapter."
2,"Looks good, bad design","This showerhead looks pretty neat in a shower, but the design has some notable flaws. First, its more like a drip than a shower when u trun it on. Second, its difficult to tighten the sleeve over your existing shower pipe."
5,Belkin RJ45M Patch FastCAT 5e Ethernet Network Cable,"This network cable works very well. I'm no technician but I know I have not suffered any loss of performance. I also like the fact that it has a safety feature at the heads to prevent the snagging and breaking off of the clip which is what happened to me and precipitated my purchase of this item. Lastly, it comes in some pleasing colors for those of us who like our system to look good."
3,Works,It works like it should. Got here in the amount of time that it said. What I thought it would be
3,Swing Or Rock-a-Billy? Torn Between Two Lovers,"If you were a fan of the Stray Cats, you will like this CD. If you like the swinging Brian Setzer Orchestra, this is not the one for you. Many think the swing fad of 1999 has passed and to many it has, yet for those of us who never stopped drinking Martinis or listening to the Rat Pack, Brian, please make up your mind. You have us coming and going. The BSO is still solid and you have the ability to play a little jazz guitar too. Remember your jazz roots in the Village my man, your fans await."
3,Bring back Rockin Brian,"I expected something new from Brian,something new but in the Brian Setzer mould,unfortunately this CD is not that.It starts off with Sixty Years which has a George Thuroughgood/ZZ Top feel,hard rockin music with a hint of Rockabilly .I found ""Do,nt trust a woman "" the same,hard rockin with a half teaspoonful of vintage Setzer Rockabilly.The reason I love the Stray Cats music and the Brian Setzer Trio,and the BSO music is that he has basically kept a Rock n'Roll/Rockabilly base foundation and introduced new concepts ie Swing in the case of ""VAAVOM"".In this case of the move to ""Swing"" ,I was not sure at the start but I ended up buying the DVD,live in Japan.But this album loses the Brian Setzer magic it does not seem original .I feel that with this album there is a tendency on my part to think that Setzer has lost his originality and has become mainstream.I wish he had built on the success of ""68 COMEBACK SPECIAL"",songs like ""Hot Rod Girl"" or ""Americano"" from the Vaavoom CD."
3,Good but not his best effort,"Simply put, Brian's music and voice sound ""tired"" on this collection. That's the best way I can describe it. Normally, his music is so energetic. Even some of his lyrics are a little ""sappy"". Don't get me wrong, there is some good stuff here and it pains me to only give it three stars. However, Ignition! is a tough act to follow!"
2,"""Ignition"" is much better","This record simply does not match the overall quality and cleverness of 68 comeback special's ""Ignition"" and that's why it's a disappointment. Although it starts out with a great rock tune in ""Sixty Years"" it sets a somewhat depressing tone for the rest of the record. Gone is the witty lyrics of 68cbs and are placed with dull phrases such as, ""I think the bar next door is gay."" Gone is the mind-boggling guitar work we know he is capable of and the swearing seems out of character and a bit unnecessary. The record seems very raw and if I remember correctly, these tracks were cut a few years before they were actually released. I understand the desire for artists to expand or try different things simply to keep themselves interested in their career; unfortunately this is a disappointing follow up to a far superior record in ""Ignition."""
1,go ahaed and skip this one,"go buy the dirty boogie stzer cd instead, this is not a good setzer cd at all..."
3,"Hot rods, burger joints and What The Hell?!","If you're looking for Pennsylvania 6-5000...this aint it. This CD is more like a big black boot on the accelerator of an old Chevy big block, although tracks like ""Ring, Ring Ring"" and ""Smokin & Burnin"" will swing ya. But ya better off cuffin yer jeans for this one, kids. For the most part anyway....There are enough good tunes here for someone to accept Setzer's attempt to move away from the Swing ding, and he can do it well, but tunes like ""Wild Wind"", ""When The Bells Dont Chime"" and ""St. Jude"" are real soars in this whole mix. Left field and then some. Hepcats, take the two I gave you and call me in the morning. Stay away from the rest. If Rockabilly is your thing, half these tunes are up your alley. Very cool, even. And finally, if you are the type to praise anything Setzer does, no matter what, seek some help. I'll hit this CD from time to time, but it's hard to believe this'll be in the tops of any respectable collection...whatever it is you dig."
3,"Hot rods, burger joints and What The Hell?!","If you're looking for Jump Jive & Wail all over again...this aint it. This CD is more like a big black boot on the accelerator of an old Chevy big block, although tracks like ""Ring, Ring Ring"" and ""Smokin & Burnin"" are definately swingin. But ya better off cuffin yer jeans on this one, kids. For the most part anyway....There are enough good tunes here for someone to accept Setzer's attempt to move away from the Swing thing, and I think he does it well, but tunes like ""Wild Wind"", ""When The Bells Dont Chime"" and ""St. Jude"" are real soars in this whole mix.

1,appalling,I started with Dirty Boogie - GREAT! Then went back for Guitar Slinger - Also great!Since then?? I have given up on Brian - this went straight to 2nd hand.
4,Mother's Day Gift,"I brought this watch for my mom as a gift for Mother's Day and she said she loved it. She called it ""wonderful"" and said it's the perfect thing to wear when she's out with her friends."
5,WW Tracking Scale,"I like this scale. It does take some getting used to exactly where to position your body to get an accurate weight but once you figure it out it's great. I love that it tracks my weight loss, it's validating (as long as the weight is going down) and it was a great new years resolution scale."
1,Did not work,My scale never worked as promised. I was not able to set my start weight or goal weight. I finally gave up. After having the scale for six months all I get when I try the scale is an error message. Save your money.
2,Just okay,"I don't really have a huge problem with the weight fluctuating that others mentioned, but I am frustrated with this scale. It says to ""tap"" on the scale to get it to zero out, and when we do, it says ""lo"" and turns off. It takes about 4 or 5 taps to get it to go to ""0.00"". This has been happening since day one, and my husband and I have had it now for nearly a year. It's just a little annoying to waste so much time to weigh in."
3,I mistrust the accuracy of this scale...,"I've been using this scale for several weeks and what I notice that is the most troubling is that if I get on it three times in succession, it will show a different weight each time. How do I know which weight is accurate? I've found myself going back to my reliable, Health-o-meter, analog scale to verify which weight on this one was accurate."
3,Not very accurate,"I have the previous incarnation of this scale that only holds weight for two users. I have a few problems with it.1)Definately not as accurate as it claims. I would say it is +/- two or three pounds at best. It also cheats...if you change the position of the scale and weigh yourself again, it seems to display the exact same weight. You can get around this by hitting one of the user saved weight buttons to reset the scale. When you do this you will discover the wild variations in weight measured.2)Not very sturdy for something with a weight limit of 380 pounds. I am not near the max weight but there is sometimes nasty sounding groans, snaps and pops happening when I use it. The plastic feels cheap.3)You can not set a weight goal. It calculates a very inaccurate one for you. It negates the point of having a saved weight feature in my opinion.On the plus side, the scale has a great capacity if you are on the obese side and it is very easy to read."
1,Entirely worthless,"As others have noted, this scale 'cheats' to give duplicate measurements as if it's accurate. The truth is it's highly inaccurate. Simply waiting a few minutes between weighings will reveal the truth. This scale is fit for the trashbin."
5,I love this scale!!,This is the first scale I've had that forces me to be balanced before it gives me my weight. It ensures that I'm getting an accurate measure each time. It's easy to program and a big help on my weight loss journey.
5,Extremely Accurate,"I just got my scale and it's perfectly accurate. You can get on and off a few times within 5 minutes, and it'll display the same weight for you each time. I love it!"
5,excellent product,"I am very happy with this scale. It takes about 30 seconds to give a reading, but the measurements are very consistent. If I step on it 5 times in a row, it gives the same result."
2,Not reliable!,"Every time I use this scale the readings are all over the place. You get on the scale and get 1 reading....get back on a second time and get another....and another.Basically have to go with, take the reading as accurate if you get it four times in a row.That is ridiculous!"
2,Fluctuating weight and flimsy scale,"I ordered this scale because it seemed like a cool idea to keep track of your weight and goal weight.Received the scale, opened the box and took the scale out. I noticed that it didn't seem very substantial.I weighed myself. Got off the scale and weighed myself again. Then I did that again. The reason? I wanted to see if the numbers stayed the same. As other reviewers have noted, it showed my weight as wildly fluctuating by more that 5 pounds.Needless to say, I returned this. It's the first item I have had to return to amazon. The return process was relatively painless unlike overstock.com.Good idea, not so good product."
1,Cord broke the first day,"On the first day, the cord broke right at the base. Now it does not work and I'm not sure what to do...order another or just forget it."
2,Not bad,"If you want something cheap, this is okay. I use it for Karaoke and it breaks at focused vocals, you have to pull it away. Not bad for the price though. If you need something cheap just for fun, this would be okay."
3,"Yes Greatest Hits Live? Well, perhaps...","Yes fans will want this CD, if only for a great version of ""Awaken"" live (one only can imagine how they pulled off this multi-layered song live), and the price is certainly right. But the title is quite misleading, since half of the tracks on this CD aren't live at all, and seem to be added to this collection to fill out the CD and also to promote Yes's last studio CD, ""The Ladder."" Other groups have done this, to be sure, adding some audience sounds to give the appearance of being live, but this CD doesn't even attempt to do that. ""Homeworld (The Ladder)"", ""Open Your Eyes"", ""Spirit of Survival"" and ""New Language"" are the suspect songs here: nice to have them, but they are not live. A better suggestion for the definitive collection of live Yes would be YESSONGS LIVE. There's no studio songs purporting to be live on that one, and more greatest hits, too!"
2,OK Book,Although a short book it took some time to get into the material. Too much negative explanations in the beginning
2,Fair - Not a stand-alone textbook,"This textbook contained a lot of technical information but offered little connection to real-life macroeconomics. I love economics and feel that it is necessary to emphasize its everyday uses in order to motivate a student's learning.Further, it is in no means a stand-alone text. By that I mean that it is not a text that can be utilized by a student independent of participation in a traditional classroom setting. Most of the topics are not expanded upon sufficiently to create true understanding of the concepts."
2,You get what you pay for,"This is a very inexpensive sleeve ironing board. If you don't have to iron shirts very often, it might last for a few years, but if you need to do this type of ironing frequently, this product is not recommended. It is cheaply made with particle board and will break with frequent use."
4,Does the Job,"For occasional uses, I would recommend this ironing board. I have a few pieces of clothing with long sleeves that require a specific ironing board for sleeves. It probably won't last a lifetime, but it didn't cost very much and is small enough to store. For the price I'm very happy with the product. I would recommend it to others."
2,No padding,"This thing is pretty much unpadded, which makes it hard to use because you end up pressing creases where the edge of the board is. it folds up nicely though."
3,i like the size but....,I like the size of the ironing board. It is exactly as described. However the only qualm I have is that it doesn't lock in place. So when I'm ironing the board collapses. BOOO! I wish it came with that functionality.
4,sleeve iron board,"I have been looking for this kind of sleeve iron board for a long time till I found it of course in Amazon, it is perfect exactly what I was looking for."
3,Good for the price,"The Size of the board is good, just right for sleeves. If I could design one, it would have a way to weight it down or attach to surface, and would change the cover so the fabric slides over the board more easily."
1,Poor quality,I've purchased two of these....should have learned the first time. Both of them broke in the exact same spot. The particle board just cannot handle any sort of pressure and easily snaps. I will NOT be buying this kind of sleeve board again.
1,Piece of JUNK!,"I did not purchase this from Amazon, but from a local JoAnn's store, and within a few months it completely fell apart. I once had a metal sleeve board, but when it rusted, I bought this one, since I looked all over town and it was the only one I could find. It is made out of cheap particle board, and literally crumbled as I was using it. I am not a professional seamstress, just a mom who is particular about her kids' clothes, and sleeve boards are great for ironing kids' clothes. However, it seems if you use steam at all, it just disenegrates! I tried to return it to JoAnn's and they didn't want to take responsibility for it, saying, ""Sorry, that's how they are made now....you should try to screw a metal bracket onto it and fix it."" No, JoAnn's....YOU should check Amazon and find yourselves a better quality product to stock!"
3,Sleep Ironing Board,The ironing board works well. The only thing I would change would be the length of it. It just isn't quite long enough for dress shirt sleeves.
3,"Flimsy, but better than nothing","I purchased this for some tailoring work. I like the fact that it is collapsible, but that seems to be part of what makes it sort of junky. I can use it to iron the sleeves of my shirts before I wear them, but it bends far too much for pressing open seams and such for dress shirt construction."
2,too narrow and short,i have to iron a large number of shirts for my husbands work week at a time all while watching a 1 year old so any way of making things go faster and easier is welcomed. while this does fit his sleeves its so short and narrow that i have to keep turning the sleeve (4-5 times) to get it to hit the entire portion of the sleeve then it has to be moved to the upper part of the sleeve so i can get that part. Its so much easier to just do it on the full sized ironing board.maybe its made for childrens shirts?
3,"Accurate readout, but not backlit","I was looking for a small, very accurate tire gauge, and found this Cruztools would fit the bill. It has three different readouts, but all of them are a bit small and they are not backlit. So, if you are somewhere where it's dark and you don't have a flashlight you won't be able to see this one. Other than that, it is one of the few that will read out in 0.1 PSI increments, which is helpful with the new cars that have tire pressure sensors."
4,Very sturdy!,"Chicago Cubs Sphere ChairMuch more substantial than I thought. I bought this for our grandson and it is quality all the way. It would be better for home use rather than using like a lawn chair as it is rather heavy to carry compared to a lawn chair. This would be a perfect TV chair for watching TV or playing video games. It would be good in a sports-themed bedroom for a child or teenager. It sits a little low for anyone over 40, but will accommodate an adult just fine."
5,Outstanding Book,"The book was very insightful, easy to read and at times humerous. This is a spiritual guide to relationships that are pleasing to God and will change the way you interact with others in your relationships.P.S. I only rated the book five stars because of the scale ---it should get six!A must on everyone's reading list!"
2,Update platform,"I used this program several years ago when I ran the computer lab in an elementary school. The kids loved it. Recently, I bought it for my granddaughter. I was SO disappointed when it came. It will only run on Windows 95 or lower. Sim City tends to be too hard for younger children to use independently and enjoy. Sim Town was great. I'd love to see it updated for the newer systems. Don't waste your money if you have a system newer than Windows 95."
5,Hask Pure Shine,"Very happy with this product, unfortunate that it is not available in stores in Canada. Will definitely re-order this product."
1,horrible movie,this movie has put me off couples porn completely. The other reviewers must be talking about a different film. One complete star --generous.
4,"Good book, but tailor to your situation","I read the first half of the book (which is to be read by the dad alone), then proceeded to read the latter half with my son. I would highly recommend that the dad read the whole book first, not just the first half. Generally the book is well done, but I found a variety of the descriptions to simply cover situations and scenarios which I largely did not experience as a boy. Since the book asks the dad, at the end of each chapter, to talk about their experiences you want to be prepared to address issues you may not have experienced. I don't fault the author so much for this (everyone has a different experience, and it is ultimately absurd for anyone to think that everyone is cookie cutter), but this is an important set of topics to discuss with your son - read the whole book and tailor appropriately, IMHO."
1,Massive ripoff,"I agree completely with the previous reviewer, while all Monster cables are overpriced this one takes it to a whole new level. The going price for a cable like this is about $2 online or $6 at your local computer store. There is absolutely nothing about the Monster cable that makes it worth paying $50. This is about a $49 markup for Monster."
5,Medium Tension Band,"The Bell Resistance Toning Band is a high quality band perfect for intermediate users. As a bonus, this comes with a door attachment so you can do more exercises to sculpt and tone your body. The exercise manual is not exactly comprehensive and I found some of the exercises would only work with a light resistance band. In one exercise you attach the band to the top of a door while in others you place the band under your feet to do arm exercises. You may want to look for a book likeThe Great Stretch Tubing Handbookfor more exercises.The exercises in the manual include:LungeFront RaisesTricept KickbackSide RaiseArm CurlShoulder FlyesBack ExtensionArm RowsChest PressShoulder PressAb CrunchLat PullSo overall this is a good product that will last you a long time. You can also take this with you to exercise while you are traveling. The foam handles are very comfortable and the door attachment is a real plus.~The Rebecca Review"
4,offbeat mystery,"If you like mystery's with a twist, this movie is pretty good.If you are offended easily by certain subjects, language, or sexual situations, I would not recommend this movie as it is quite graphic and vulgar."
2,The yawn factor.,"Far too much is made of this film simply because the main characters in it are lesbian. Rather than simply look at that if you just watch this film as an erotic thriller similar to Basic Instincts then you have a serious case of the yawn factor.The film simply does not get going, for a suspense thriller you need well, suspense! The characters are just so dull you get the impression even the actresses are bored and are just praying for the director to say ""Cut"" so then can go home. The film just drifts along at a walking pace and no sorry, just because the main characters are lesbian is not going to convince me the film is any good.A poor film that if you can sit through to the end you will be probably kicking yourself you just wasted and hour and a bit of your life when you could have been watching paint dry."
2,problems with dvd,"Both dvds that I purchased will not play on either of my players nor will they play on my laptop. They start, stop, and the quality of what I do see is poor."
1,Pretty much a DUD!!!,This movie was pretty boring--not much on plot--it skipped around alot and left me confused at times. The acting was ok but not inspiring. Rent this and make up your own mind before purchasing it. I just did not like this one.
1,Truly horrible.,"I was looking forward to this movie, and was distinctly disappointed from the first frame to the last. The characterizations were comic, sterotypical and shallow as if they had been fleshed out by one Kelly McGillis' ""bohemian"" students. And no one really looked good, as if they had already gone overbudget paying Kelly and couldn't afford enought make-up to cover all the actress' blemishes. Finally, the erotic scenes were odd, awkward and uninspired with absolutely no chemistry between the two principles. Susie Porter actually had more chemistry with Kelly Mcgillis' husband and seemed to enjoy her intimate moment with him more than any other in the film. One final note: There is an offensive moment that attempts to give credence to the notion that lesbians are predatory: When the Susie Porter character has a falling out with her lover, she goes to her lesbian friend for support -- the friend takes this as a nice opportunity to fondle Susie's breast......"
4,Absolutely worth watching,"The other reviewers have done justice to the plot, I will tell you the truth. This is a very enjoyable and sexy thriller. Okay, it is not groundbreaking but the detective is super cute (in a freckled stocky british soft butch way) and her co star is at her unvarnished sexual peak. Definitely worth renting, a nice way to kill an afternoon."
2,Predictable,"Street-smart private investigator Jill Fitzpatrick (Susie Porter) is investigating the disappearance of Mickey, a young female student. After meeting Mickey's poetry lecturer Diana (Kelly McGillis - pre-coming out as a lesbian herself), they begin an intense affair. When Mickey's body is discovered and Jill begins receiving threatening messages, she begins to wonder if she is too close to the truth or blinded by passion.This highly predictable lesbian thriller doesn't really pull off the excitement factor viewers usually look for in a thriller.Chris AldersonAuthor of the 2013 Lesbian Film Guide"
1,Loser,"I thought it might be interesting, but got tired of waiting for it to get better. Didn't want to waste my time to watch the whole thing."
4,The Monkey's Mask,I've seen some of Susie's other work but this film shown a side ( and a lot more than just her side) of herI never saw before.
4,Surprise,"I enjoy foreign mysteries, bought this quite by accident. The actors were fantastic, it really is a jem. I have to buy another copy because my ex-wife stole it."
2,Just say no,"Not a very good mystery; not a very good sex film, either. It was disappointing all the way around! Kelly McGinnis was sexy once, but perhaps she has never been a good actress; now, not so much sexy or a good actress. This is one of those films that makes me angry for wasting the time!"
3,"lame movie, beautiful bodies","The dialogue is contrived; the plot is nearly inexplicable and definitely irrelevant, but I gotta say - it's worth the price of admission to finally see that hot Amish in the all-together. Ms. McGillis looks fantastic, and, uh...gets right in there! Plus, oddly, this is the first time I've ever had the thought ""Wow. Kelly McGillis can really act!"" Worth a rent, but you're lonely if you're going to buy this thing."
3,Be aware this needs a power supply to function!,You can't just plug it in and have it work - what the advertisement doesn't show you is the wall-wart needed to power the card. The laptop PCMCIA slot can't provide the juice. This may be a deal breaker for some.
4,interesting and rational,"I like this book for the background sketch I need on evaluating some genre painting of the period. The author is clear, but of course I wanted even more details..but this is a good book. I am disappointed that the paper is of low paperback quality and so is yellowed and becoming brittle. I like to keep books for a long time if they are good ones, such as this one is."
2,Not very pretty or sophisticated.,"I was expecting something more useful. Some of the cookies looked lumpy, and the decorating wasn't of the highest caliber."
4,Strange read,"This is a rather difficult book and it will not fare very well for a casual reading. It forced you to think, to look and rather more to feel what it is around you. It actually demand a lot from a reader, which is not a problem as long as the pay off is this good.This is one of the most visual book I read. I think the writer have a picture of the events in his mind and describe it, rather than just thought of it as a prose. The think is, this will not work very well if the structure of the book allow it to be. And amazingly, I think it works quite well. The last chapter of the book make me look around in my dark room, feeling a breath of someone else on my neck.Just don't read it when you are alone."
4,Curious and Intriguing,"I have always enjoyed Alan Moore's writing style. One day, I stumbled upon this book and was immediately intrigued and decided to give it a go. It is a complicated book, and I could spend a great deal of time talking about how complex and detailed it is, but for the sake of brevity, I'll keep the review simple. I really enjoyed the way Moore took this theme and made it evolve throughout the various stages of the book. It was a masterful telling of inter-connected stories.Here is my one complaint: Some of the earlier stories with their simplified caveman-like dialogue, while interesting, were also frustrating. It was a fun device, but it has its limits, and after some time, the story became tedious because it was like wading through mud. Other than that, it was a very enjoyable read. I'd definitely recommend it to someone who enjoys Moore's work, with the precaution that they should know what his style in the book will be like."
1,waste og my $4,"this is a total waste of money,the native speaker cant be understood by me or my filipino friends ,,,go with the pimsleur language cd"
4,Really great hair straightner,"I have been using this for past 3 years. it works very well. I have thick wavy hair and using this I get great shiny straight hair. The plates are wide but very sleek design. Only thing is, this is not dual voltage and on my trip to UK I short circuited my first one but I purchased another one right away."
5,We love it!,My neice has the same straightener. I used it and loved it. I looked around for the same make and model that she had and found it on Amazon and bought it right away. When it arrived my daughters started using it and love it too. Our old straightend used to pull our hair and it looked frizzy. This straightener makes your hair feel really good. My daughters have had complimants after they started using it. This is a great product.
5,"Works just as well as, if not better than, ""expensive"" brands!!!!!!","I was skeptical about buying an inexpensive flat iron knowing that there is probably a reason why they are so cheap compared to the expensive ""professional"" ones. I bought this T-Studio straightener anyway after reading about the Tourmaline ceramic plates and comparing it to the ""professional"" brands for $100+. I have used a Chi before (my sister-in-law's) and I loved how straight and silky it made my hair. After I bought this one, I tried it at home right away and thankfully it worked just as well! The tourmaline plates help prevent humidity from frizzing your hair...my hair is still straight and silky even after taking a shower. I highly recommend this straightener! It works just as well as the more expensive brands and costs so little! I am so happy I didn't waste money on an expensive one."
4,Good Straightener!!!,"I haven't tried many straighteners but this one seems to do a very good job. The only flaw is my hand keep hitting the settings and thereby changing it. Other than that, I have had no major problems. My hair lasts for weeks after using this straightener (my hair is somewhat straight already). I would recommend this product."
3,Not good for thick ethnic hair,"Nice iron, doesn't get hot enough for thick non-permed ethnic hair. It did absolutely nothing to my hair. I think for my hair I have to find an iron that gets at minimum 450 degrees. I think this one is about 300-350."
5,Great Book,The Distance Between Us is a good book. For me this book was a very emotional roller coaster. I enjoyed it and could relate to some of things they experienced. Sarah Playle is great at describing things. The only thing I would recommend is... I want to know more about each character's past but I always want to know everything. This is a great book and made me want more.
2,Not good Clippers,"Does not create a clean cut, not very sharp or stable. When you put your dog's nail in the blade separates away from the rest of the mechanism and just grazes the tip of the dog's nail without cutting. What i could cut ended up being jagged and tattered. My dog is about 22 Lbs - a terrier mix... maybe it would work for a smaller dog but I don't think it's strong enough for a dog her size."
4,Fantastic Introduction,"Taxonomy doesn't get the respect it used to, but this important basic science is still alive and kicking. Anyone working on taxonomic treatments of a plant group will find this a useful introduction, reference handbook, and something of a glimpse into the basics (and I mean very basics) of systematics. Appropriate for advanced undergrads and grad students."
1,No TOC,"This Kindle edition has no active Table of Contents. If that doesn't bother you, then buy all means purchase it. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
4,Its ok I am just used to nonstick,"Works best from stove top to over or vice versa,kinda hard getting used to!But I do use it weekly and it could be a little bigger like one more quart!"
5,Exactly what i wanted,"Bought it for one of my friends for Christmas, she wanted one for a long time. Me and her used it numerous times, and love it. The top griddle part is very useful and you don't have to buy the lid separately. It is deep enough, and preseasoned. All you do is take care of it nicely - do not wash it with soap, just let soak with hot water, do not use abrasives, dry well after washing and season with some vegetable oil."
5,Love it,"I Have my cast iron pot now for two weeks and love it. I am learning how to take care of the it, so it won't rust."
5,Lodge LCC3 Logic Pre-Seasoned Combo Cooker,"I and my wife both love these two pans. They heat up fast and cook everything very well.Yes, I said two pans,one a deep pot the other a grill and lid combo.They are made out ofa heavy grade of iron and steel and have a life time guarantee as well.The price was reasonablefrom Amazon.com and all the bragging of other customers made this a great bargain for me.Amazon.com price was right and the bragging about these pots sold me as well,so I boughtthem for my wife and I, all of you out there that have a need for steel or iron potsneed to give them a try they are a great buy."
5,Not much can go wrong here...,It's a cast iron pan. Not high tech. Works great. Nothing like cooking on cast iron. Heat distribution is excellent.
5,Good cookware,This is a very good product for cooking in the oven. The cleanup is easy too. I really enjoy cooking with it.
5,Excellent unit,"Haven't used it yet. I gave it to my wife for Christmas, but it looks like it is everything it is supposed to be in a cast iron skillet.We can't wait to get it seasoned and well used:-)"
5,Love them,"Cook great! So far nothing's stuck to it for long during and after cooking. Ive used the ""pan"" as both a lid and a pan. Love them."
4,"Great for cooking, but too heavy","I love cooking in these pans. If you care for them as they say in the box (don't use soap etc) they are not more sticky than a Teflon pan, and you don't have to worry about all the nasty chemicals. My only problem is that they're very heavy and hard to handle sometimes. You couldn't use them to flip a crepe for instance."
5,Love this thing!!!,"This is my first dutch oven and although some reviews talk about having the pan/skillet as an awkward combo to the pot of this tag team, I'm actually okay with this. I've used this so far to make a stew instead of using my slow cooker as it's worked great since I used the top to brown my meat and vegetables before throwing it into the pot and then some stock and water and then covering it with the pan I just used. Better efficiency of using stuff I'm already cooking with. I had planned to try baking bread with this thing but as far as cast iron it's relative easy to clean and haven't seen any issues with this type of cooking instrument. The size is just right for your standard 2 to 3 serving meal. Would recommend if you're into cast iron cooking (that means you don't just cook with this but have to understand how to cook with cast iron as well as taking care of it)."
5,Now THIS is handy.,"A two piece cookware that can function together or seprately, the lid doubles as a fry pan and vice versa. What was an added bonus I discovered when it arrived is that the lid can flip and sit in the recess of the lower piece for compact storage. This will now be used in the home and out in the field."
4,I love them; wife does not,"I love my cast iron cookware. I don't want to cook on my aluminum/teflon stuff anymore because I love the feel of the iron/seasoning. I also think it imparts the taste, and it is fun knowing that the pan is becoming more ""mine"" every time I cook with it. After cooking a few times, it is pretty nonstick. They are also so verstile--I can fry some meat to brown it, then put the same pan into the oven to slow cook said meat for some delicous tikka kebabs. I plan to make a shepherd's pie in the pot soon.My wife, however, has a hate/hate relationship with them. She says that they are too heavy, and that they sometimes impart too much flavor into eggs if she is cooking those. She's also accidentally turned the wrong burner on a couple of times and burned the seasoning off of them, causing me to have to re-season them. To do so, I'd recommend using vegetable shortening."
3,Love cast iron but this isn't as even as I am used to,"Was a great deal for two pieces of cast iron but I think I will try to find another brand next time. There are definite hot spots when using this. It do like all the other things about it being cast iron, seasoning and cleaning and such but the fact that it is not even bothers me."
4,Great Purchase,I am just learning to cook with these iron cast pans. The first time I cooked with the pan I didn't use any oil and the chicken didn't come out very good. The second batch I used a little oil and it worked pretty good. It is a good purchase for the price and getting 2 skillets. I store them inside the oven.
5,Great pan for basic kitchen,"if you are just outfitting your kitchen, start with this pan. Especially if you are cooking for 2 or 3. The 10"" deep skillet is one of the least expensive, decent fry pans available. You can do a dutch apple pie with the lid on in the oven, you can cook eggs, pancakes, french toast on the lid. If you are cooking for 4, and want just one fry pan, get the 12"". Otherwise this pan does it all. Roast, fry, oven and stove top. The pans are tough, mine is going on 20+ years.Downside, takes a bit more oil or grease than a Teflon pan, but then if you own a parrot you already know you can't cook on Teflon. Makes you wonder how good it is for the rest of us."
4,Iron clad value and durability,"If you compare prices for other cookware, cast iron is a bargain. A friend had a both a cast iron skillet and a Dutch oven on his birthday list, and this Lodge cast iron combo cooker satisfied both requests in one. The ""lid"" is also a skillet in its own right, and the base is deep enough in which to cook a chicken. The pre-seasoned feature provides a head-start on achieving a well-seasoned finish.One potential drawback of cast iron is its heavy weight. With a shipping weight of 14 lbs, this cooker might not be the best-suited for cooks without the strength to lift it. Additionally, due to a few small, but sharp-feeling burrs along the edge of the cookware, I have deducted one star from my rating.Overall, I am satisfied with the value and durability of cast iron, and it makes a nice cookware addition to a well-stocked kitchen."
4,new to cast iron,"This is my first cast iron cookware and I like it so far. It definitely takes some getting used to. My main issue has been that the handle is really hot after using it so I have to let it sit on the stove for a while before I can clean it and put it away. Also, it comes pre-seasoned but I tried to season it myself and it didn't really work. Probably my fault. It's getting better every time I use it. Pancakes on the cast iron are so much better!"
5,Cast Iron Cookware,You won't be disappointed with this two piece cast iron combo cooker. You can fry chicken in the larger pot and bake cornbread in the smaller pot/lid. It's very functional and easy to clean and the upkeep is minimal. I washed it and then apply cooking oil to protect the seasoning. I JUST LOVE IT!
4,new Lodge compared to old,"As this is an old man's evaluation, I don't mean it to be negative of Lodge cast iron in general. this chicken cooker is heavier than one I bought 20 years ago. If I had a chance to do it over, I wouid buy a giddle pan to use in place of the combo cooker top. I have used new Lodge skillets and find them favorable to others now available. The quality of the chicken dinner I prepared in the combo cooker was right there with my old one, it's just a little harder on an old mans wrists.Lodge LCC3 Logic Pre-Seasoned Combo Cooker"
5,Great cooker,"Nice right out of the box. First use, just a quick rinse and a small amount of oil and no sticking what so ever!"
5,This is an excellent set.,I love this Lodge set. besides regular cooking I have been using them to make Artisan style bread in and they work great. Nice heavy set and should last a life time.
5,Required gear,"If you've not used this gear, then you've no idea what you're missing out on ... it's worth it, so go through your recipes and see what you can use it on ..."
5,The best,"Comes pre seasoned but was told to reseason 3-5 times more from professional chefs so i did and am happier then a Tea party member after the Marxist defeat in November.The food just slides around as if it is cooking on the air in Libtards heads.Nothing sticks, Just like facts do with them!!!!Will be getting more items from Lodge in the future.The whole reason i got started is due to my new induction cooktop and these are the perfect match just like the R&R; train in November !"
3,seemed decent but came broke,Shipped on time came broke. How do you break a cast iron pan handle off??? So didn't get to try the product but looked OK does seem to need more seasoning to pan compared to my other pans that I have bought.
3,Not supper but can be used,"This set is not as good as another line of similar product I had. But with this price range, it is not that bad."
5,Doesn't get any better,"You've read the reviews. Lodge is THE name to trust for cast-iron cooking. Foods cooked in properly-maintained cast iron simply tastes better. There are thousands of excellent recipes out there for cast-iron cooking. The cooker is extremely versatile and can be used on the stove, in the oven and over the campfire. Everyone should have at least one piece of cast-iron cookware and the Combo-cooker is perfect because it can be used as a skillet, a pot or a Dutch Oven. This is an easy recommendation."
5,Fantastic and practical,"This is the first piece of cast-iron cookware I have ever owned. I purchased it when I was looking for a dutch oven for baking bread. This was the only one that I could find that was the appropriate size, and the fact that the lid is also a skillet was a big plus.I have since baked many loaves of bread in it and it has performed wonderfully. I also use the skillet for searing steaks before they go on the grill, and have been braising a lot of meals with it.Make sure that you clean it well and thoroughly dry it to prevent rust. This is one of the best multi-taskers I have ever owned and I am thrilled with it. Practical, flexible, and VERY reasonably priced."
5,Great for charcoal stove top too !,"This is an excellent value set ! If you have limited space, buy this set cos' you will be able to stack them up (skillet / cover can be flip right side up and stack over the pot too. The lid seals the pot very well. I have three Le Cresuet iron cast dutch ovens - but this one beats it with the creative use of lid and pot. I use it with my Cobbs BBQ - it fits well and grill well. I have also used on the glass stove top and oven and it works well. It came seasoned but I cooked bacon during the first use and it remains non-stick. The pot, though not too big, is enough for 3-4 person. It is quite heavy due to the longer handle (vs short handle). Make sure you get a mitten."
1,Overrated Lodge Pre-seasoned cooker,"My daughter gave me a Lodge combo cooker and a skillet for my birthday.It is NOT preseasoned - I cooked a roast in the combo cooker and it was terrible -plus it was so heavy I couldn't lift it with one hand.After the terrible roast I soaked the cooker in my Corian sink - the next morning the shape of the cooker was in my sink in rust. We have tried everything to get the rust ring out of the sink but nothing works not even bleach, rust remover - comet - nothing.If you are smart you won't buy these Lodge pots and pans.I've already thrown the box it came in away - I would love to return these things and get something I could use - Big mistake.Daryle"
5,Excellent set,"We purchased this set for a camping trip and liked it so much we now use it at home on a regular basis. We also purchased 2 more sets as gifts for other people. Lodge is well made, durable, and made in the USA. When properly cared for it will last forever and food will never stick."
5,cast iron,"Thanks to COOKS magazine (sept/oct 2007) we wanted to try some cast iron cookware... I purchased several pieces from Lodge...and gave them as Christmas presents. They were all pre-seasoned...and we have been having a blast trying recipes especially written for cast iron.. I believe most (if not all) Lodge cast iron cookware is pre-seasoned thus eliminating a time consuming process..The cookware IS heavy and with proper care, should last several lifetimes. I will definately be purchasing many more items from Lodge"
5,Excellent,"I was hoping this would fit in my toaster oven (12 inch interior). But, it just barely doesn't. I should have gotten the Lodge dutch oven that is this size and has a lid that doubles as a skillet. It has loop handles instead--so it would fit (plus, the deep pan would be deeper).Anyway, it's still a great pan. It fits in my Rival 22 quart roaster oven--so it's not so bad about the toaster oven.The pan-lid was seasoned much better than the deep pan. I had to do a lot of the seasoning on the deep one, myself (but I don't mind that).Anyway, this is great for the stove-top. It's great for oven use. Works very well in my roaster oven, too."
4,Love this set!,"I purchased this with the 8-inch skillet. I use the lid part a lot to stair fry and to grill. I cooked fish, veggies, burgers, pancake, and more, all turned delicious! For the first use, the food got stuck on the surface, but after that, I haven't had any problem. If you find the food stuck, let the pan cool down a little, then slowly scrape it off. It works for me.My favorite food was fried potatoes. Wash well and cut potatoes with skin on, cook slow with a plenty of oil (but not deep frying amount), season with salt, pepper, and any desired dried herbs... yummy... a big difference compared to frozen french fries!I was scared of using cast iron pans coz I have a glass stove top. So far, I have no problem with a caution. I usually like to shake the skillet when I stair fry, but cast iron pans are too heavy to do so in anyways... This is why I omitted one star &#9734;."
4,This Combo Cooker is well worth it...,"We're in the process of replacing all of our teflon-coated pans with cast iron. This was the first combination we purchased after we cleaned up on old cast iron skillet from the back of the cupboard. What a great combination. The ""cover"" is a wonderful shallow pan, by itself. The bottom is really a chicken fryer, a deep pot, or a three-quart dutch oven. A standard 10.25 glass or cast iron cover will fit the bottom just as easily as the enclosed ""cover/skillet"" if you need it. The versatility of this combo is amazing. The seasoning was pretty good -- a bit of sticking and a couple of uneven spots, but with a bit of use it worked out.The day we unpacked it, we used the bottom as a chicken fryer (it is the Lodge CF pan, according to the markings on the bottom). It was the best fried chicken we've had in years. I love the pans. I can't wait to see what else I can do with them."
5,good stuff,"Like most others on here, i can highly recommend this set. I use this set twice a day.Take a little time to get used to cooking on cast iron, use more grease while they're new, and you'll realy ejoy them. After some use and seasoning, nothing sticks. At least on my gas stove, they cook so evenly, i can work on high heat without burning stuff. Yay!"
5,YES BUY IT,GREAT THING. Great to have on stove. Use it for my bread. Use it to get good saute on anything. YES...
5,Great product - just what I was looking for!,I recently was diagnosed as anemic - was suggested that I cook in cast iron ware - this was perfect.
3,"My feelings about ""The Endgame""","Several days ago in my thirteens I attended this playgame. I must say, that I have never seen any of his playgames till now yet. That means I hadn't been allowed to understand the role of actors and the sense of the whole game before I started to focus on reading Becket autobiography and to acqaintance with his key playwritings. This game has helped me to see our life in a new way and associated a lot of thoughts and questions about humanbeing and nature at all. Absolutely fascinating. Don't miss it...."
3,Surreal theatrical creations,"""Endgame and Act Without Words"" brings together 2 theater pieces by Samuel Beckett. The book is translated from the French by the author.""Endgame"" is a strange, surreal play about the relationship between a chair-bound man and his caretaker. It has both humorous and sad aspects as these characters deal with their past history. Pain and physical decay are significant themes in this play. Storytelling is an important motif here: Beckett seems to be asking if stories liberate or enslave us.""Act Without Words"" is a one-person mime in which a performer interacts with various moving props onstage. Overall, these two pieces did not make that great an impact on me; I was really expecting more. I recommend the book if you're interested in theatrical surrealism."
4,isolation and the loss of idealism in the modern world,"Ultimately more pessimistic that Beckett's ""Godot,"" in many ways ""Endgame"" can be seen as a much fuller and altogether more haunting piece of theater. Beckett tirelessly explores our greatest fears--isolation, mortality, loss of idealism--until the play becomes a barebones expression of what it means to be human in the existential uncertainty of the post WWII western world. It is a critique of our own social values; we see ourselves, in our most potent form, in its characters.This is a Beckett play; no one else could write it. Sometimes uneven in language, inconsistent in style, such conventions do not matter here. Like ""Godot"" however, occasionally Beckett overplays his message, and that at points the play is too cryptic to follow, especially when read.However, Beckett's vision in undeniably brilliant; we see ourselves in ""Endgame"" and we are inconsolably frightened by what we see."
3,Funny if performed exactly as written,"This play appears to demonstrate a great deal of situations that appeal and connect will all of us. Despite being absurdist, it is performed in 1 room, like realisim. When played exactually to time and using the effective use of pause, this play can demonstrate excellently what every day life is really about."
1,"""Endgame"" - Ghastly!","""Endgame"" is a crude and despicable play. It's not a classic and a pitiable excuse of a play. Utterly useless and does not deserve our time. The characters are one dimensional, lacking, and unrealistic. The plot is morally confusing and worthless. I do not recommend."
2,not what i expected,thought this would be a good movie because of Robert Pattinson playing in it but i didn't like it at all
2,love & distrust,it wasn't what I expected at all. I don't have 13 more words. It wasn't what I expected. No more.
3,Love & Distrust,"The overall movie was composed of four individual short story vignettes, not one movie interweaving the characters/stories. So, it was not at all what I expected. Also, if you are expecting to see much of Robert Pattinson, well, you get approx. 10 minutes total of him; and that is being generous."
2,"Rob Pattinson fans, save your money",This DVD was advertised that Rob Pattinson was part of the movie...yeah for about 20 seconds! And those 20 seconds were not clear at all.
1,Love & Distrust,I am a Robert Downey jr fan and a Robert Pattinson fan and was extremely disappointed in this movie. Robert Pattinson is only in this movie for like 2 minutes and Robert Downey junior is only for a couple. So sorry I did not read the reviews very for really before I purchase this.
1,The big name actors had very little parts to play.,"I was very disappointed in this film. There were some great actors, but little substance to their parts. It was just short clips."
1,Waste of money,I have to say I was totally disappointed in this purchase. There were four individual stories and I could not stay interested enough to even watch it to the end. Don't waste your money.
1,A difficult movie to watch,"After seeing some previews I was looking forward to purchasing this movie. I liked most the actors in other films, but found not much was likable about this film. It was composed of several short stories, none of which were just not that interesting. Also, for some reason, it would not play on my blue ray. The disk said it was made for Japan, and I am the USA. It did play on my laptop."
1,Wow...Refund???,"I don't know if it's fair for me to review this movie. I couldn't get past the first twenty minutes before popping it out of my DVD player and taking it back to the Redbox. Bad acting, bad dialogue, bad cinematography, bad editing...so on and so forth. Save your $1.08. Wish I had..."
1,A Total Waste of Time,"I can't even begin to imagine what induced this high caliber cast to do this truly dreadful movie. Thank goodness I only paid $1 to rent it. Save your money, save your time and avoid this movie at all costs. I could say more, but I would just be repeating the comments that others have already written."
1,Just Bad,I don't get. There are some serious A list actors here and all you get is crap.Someone must have black-mailed these actors as this is the only explanation for for them to be in this.Sorry for not given a more detailed review but I feel as if this movie already wasted enough of my time.You have been warned.
1,Love & Distrust DVD,"This was the worst movie I have ever seen. There were 8 different stories and at least 6 out of the 8 made no sense or ended badly or just ended??????If you are a Robert Pattinson fan, don't waste your time...he is in it maybe all of 10 minutes...disappointing."
1,Are you Serious?,"Honestly, and I mean this, maybe the worst move I've ever seen in my life.It's simply unbelieveable that a cast like this would produce such a dreadful bunch of stories to compose a sorry excuse for a movie. It has appearances by Amy Adams, James Franco, Robert Downey Jr, James Cameron, and more!The movie is made of several different stories; all are which seem to go nowhere. The directing is amatueur, the script is terrible, and there is no depth at all to it.The story starring Amy Adams has a good feel to it, but the whole thing leading up to the ending is boring.The last one is the worst, just a bunch of confusing scenes to run absolutely nowhere (the guy from the Sopranos tries to hit on women on a sidewalk and keeps getting turned down. That's it...seriously...that's it. End credits) And he's a great actor; what were all these people thinking.To sum it up, I rented this for $1.00 and I'm still upset. Absolutely terrible. Save yourself!"
1,Complete Crap!!,"I am completely boggled as to why these caliber of actor would do a movie like this!!! I understand short stories but these didn't even have a plot, aside from pennies which was the only one I could even barely get into. I just can't believe that these actors would do a movies like this, especially James Cameron!!! They must of been paid big bucks to agree to this. The only thing I can come up with is that it was some sort of test to see if people would see a movie just because of the actors or something. They had to of been paid a crap load of money to agree to doing this film. I 100% do NOT recommend this movie...DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
1,Waist of Money,"This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a very long time. Save your money, don't buy it.!"
1,SAVE YOURSELF THE AGONY!,"This must be he most horrendous collection of short stories every put on screen and hoisted off on an unsuspecting public. This was pure punishment - we kept watching thinking there must be a point, but there wasn't. Please spare yourself the wasted time."
1,Terrible!,"I knew that it was a series of short stories, so I didn't go into it blindly. I've lost films such as ""I love NY"" that has the same layout. This series is a disaster. The quality makes it appear to be from the 1970's or sooner. The storylines are all non-existent. Don't waste your time on this film."
1,Bad Movie,This movie was very disappointing considering the caliber of actors that were in the movie. Don't waste your money or time. I hope that this movie was some sort of joke because it was terrible.
1,Love and Distrust,"This is an amateur video whose only claim to fame is its stars in really tacky short student type films. Robert Pattinson, the come-on for it appears in about 3 minutes of the short movie which is so lousy I don't want to bother to review it. Poorly directed, written, filmed and on and on. Daniel Radcliffe was one of the suporters for it in the credits. What was he thinking? To blame Pattinson for his performance is stupid as he had no say in it at all."
1,I want my life back!,"In the last 35 years, this has to be the winner for being the worst waste of time. I could at least done something productive like watching the grass grow!"
1,this movie sucked,"This movie was terriable! I hated it and could not even bring my slef to finish it. It made no sense and had a terriable story line. I do not recommed this movie to anyone, it was a completley disapointing. I cant even believe that there is so many good actors in this film and it still sucked so bad!Terriable Movie!"
1,Gave one star because you cant give none,Just rented this movie....I don't usually review items but I feel if I can save even one person from the 93 minutes of horrible acting and pointless story line than I've done my part! Extremely disappointed in every aspect of this movie. Expected more since there are some big names. Glad I didn't waste money to buy it!
3,Worth the $1 if you know what you're getting.,"This is a collection of five short films, not a unified film starring R. Patz, which is what all of these 1 star reviews thought they were getting when they saw this at a redbox.""Blue Poles,"" ""Grasshopper,"" and ""Pennies..."", the three middle films, are the three I enjoyed out of the five, with ""Pennies..."" being my favorite, easily. Even the two films I didn't like as much had some decent qualities. The setting of the first one is unique, and the last one has a ton of really famous people doing strange things.In short, if you like short films (most people don't, note all the ""This movie doesn't make sense"" reviews) this is worth a try from redbox or netflix. You'll like at least one of the shorts as they're fairly different from each other, despite the overarching themes of Love and Distrust."
3,Love & Distrust review,"I looked up the reviews of Love and Distrust after retrieving the DVD from a $1.00 box. I never go by reviews, like to judge for myself. I thought the story lines and character studies were real, direction and photography well done, total program tied together by the theme."
2,Nothing to like about it,Stories were not likeable. Primary reason it was purchased was Robert Pattison. He was on screen for about 3 minutes.
1,Hated it.,This movie was a rip off. Should have listened to all the other views that said not to buy this god aweful movie!
1,Love and Distrust starring R. Patinson,"Do not buy this DVD, the marketing on this thing is heinous! I was most interested in seeing the made for TV movie ""Summer House"", however, there are only about 3"" of RPatz in the brief 1st story. The rest are OK with other known actors, but do not buy thinking you are getting 1 hr or less of the beloved Rob Pattinson.very disapointed"
1,Most horrible movie ever,"Wow... I usually don't post reviews on bad movies (its just a casualty to watching a lot of movies) but this one is CRAP! Seriously, no wonder it went straight to DVD. Heed my advice and run away from this movie! Side note: Dear directors, can you reimburse my time I waste on your movie???"
1,Completely Unwatchable,"This movie has some actors you'd expect something of, but they sure don't shine here. This is a nothing piece of junk, totally unworthy of your time. It must have done directly to video -- there's certainly no movie audience that would sit still for this. Total, complete junk."
1,Very Disapointed,"I received the remote yesterday (Amazon did great job shipping it fast!) From there on it went down hill, first it was packaged in one of those anti theft molded packaged, I had to destroy the entire package just to get at the remote, manual and batteries. Next I tried to program the remote, you can program it by code or teach it the individual codes.To program by code you have to follow 10 (ten!!) steps! For it to learn the codes from your current remote, another 10(TEN!!) steps. None of the codes provides worked with my brand new Westinghouse TV! This worked, but 25 buttons by hand was horrible!Next I programmed my roku box by code, once you find the right code ( there are several, though non under web tv), aux, it worked fine. So far no joy on programming my New Direct TV. More later is I fight through programming."
5,Exactly What I Needed!!! Great Bargain!!,"This is such a great deal. DVD that comes with the package is very helpful. Keeps from trying to understand the manual. Program codes worked great for Panasonic TV and Scientific Atlanta cable box. Program codes didn't work for Phillips surround sound DVD system. Used the Learning function and worked great. Have never had a universal remote work with the Phillips DVD system, so I was extremely satisfied. Would highly recommend this remote!!!"
3,Doesn't control other RF devices,"I bought this to replace a DISH Network RF remote in our bedroom. But it wasn't until I read the direction book that I found it won't control other RF devices. It requires its own radio receiver. So I returned it. (Thankfully Amazon has a very good return procedure.)Otherwise, it worked well for the main functions, and the directions are well-written. I have an off-brand TV, (Digital Lifestyles), which didn't have a code number, so I had to program each button individually. Not every function was able to be programmed."
1,Don't waste your time and money. Logitech has them beat.,"I've owned two RF20s. After years of use, the buttons started wearing out. I bought a second thinking I could transfer the programs to the new one using the ""clone"" feature. Turns out I could not because had changed their firmware since I bought the first one! Given how long it takes to program this remote, I consider that an EPIC FAIL! I have since bought a Logitech Harmony 700. Instead of spending many hours programming & learning as I did with the RF20, I simply hooked the Logitech up to my computer and used their software to set it up. The Harmony 700 took no time to set up and even does what I could never figure out how to do with the RF20. Bottom line in the RF20 is ancient technology Don't waste your time and money. Get a Logitech Harmony."
4,pleas help 2 many remote's,"Bought this remote to replace many others and to clean up the clutter next to my chair,the remote is nice quality and size is good no bigger than my cable remote,I spent about about and hour and a half one day starting to set it up and it did not go the smoothest I thought it would be a little easier I did get most of the function's to work for the T.V. and cable box,but my ps3 and my stereo aren't working well at all,but the remote does come with a DVD to guide you through it ,and it does have the learn capability which works good,also it also has a light on the remote which is really nice.Over all I do recommend this remote."
3,Solid product,"The programming codes that were supposedly pre-programed for various products (direct tv receiver/jvc tv) did not work. So the remote had to be totally programed through the ""learn"" mode. Thus, programming took about an hour just to get it to fully operate a tv and direct tv receiver. But the product works fine now, so I am not dissatisfied; I just can't give it high marks."
3,No support,I can only assume that the manufacturer of the Universal Master control RF20 is no longer in business because I have tried to contact them by email and phone for several months and received no reply to resolve a small problem. I am very familiar with this remote having owned another one for six years with no trouble. Because I could not contact the manufacturer I had to return the remote to Amazon with a return penalty.
2,New RF20 not compatible with old RF20,"I have three other RF20s and just purchased a fourth. There is a ""clone"" feature which allows you to copy an already programmed RF20 to another RF20 to avoid having to manually program that RF20 when you want them to be programmed the same. I wanted to use this feature as I did with my older RF20s to avoid manually programming the new one. According to Universal Remote tech support, on the new RF20s this feature is incompatible with the older RF20s. I would have given it a 4 or 5 star rating otherwise. I wonder if they changed other things too? I'm contemplating returning it and getting a Logitech Harmony."
4,"Excellent remote, works with Comcast (Pace) DC50X","When Comcast switched cable channels to digital and sent me a DC50X, my trusty MX500 universal remote became useless.The RF20 is able to control the DTA (although the channel 5 button is a bear to learn), and is almost as good as the MX500.Plus: works with all my equipment. Minus: only 5 lines on the LCD, red backlight has way too little contrast with black lettering.Programming via learning is a bit tedious, but not needed for many devices."
1,Why buy it?,"I have two integrated systems with TV, Cable and DVD. After 4 hours trying to program this device, I finally gave up. It's worthless. Unless you have the right equipment, it won't integrate some devices which brings me back to the original configuration of multiple remote controllers. Sorry I bought it."
1,Don't waste your money,I hoped this product would give me some level of convenience dealing with the multi remote environment. No such luck! It is impossible to duplicate the functionality of my cable remote - at least for me. I have a Masters degree in technology but no amount of patience and time could make it worthwhile to try to program this cryptic device to easily control my system. Too good to be true - yes. It seems to work but is no shortcut to a better environment to enjoy HD/Surround-sound etc..........
4,Purchased a 2nd unit,"The first one I owned you used to have to press on the glass/plastic now the controls are buttons to the side. I think this will last a lot longer. I control 6 dvd players, ipod, lights, tv, project, and more with it. I bought two of them and am pleased with them."
4,great product for the price,"I have the mx650 (this ones way more expensive brother) but got this one for my parents. It replaces 4 remotes, they love it! It is very rugged as well"
3,Too complicated.,"The remote works fine, but you still have to keep all your old remotes piled on the coffee table to perform the operations that this remote doesn't have to buttons to do."
5,Perfect for my less than techno savvy wife,My wife complained about all the remotes on her end tables. I bought this for her. I just got done programming it for her and she loves it. Considering how old some of my equipement is I really got a charge out of the learning ability of this remote. I kept my wife in the room so she could pick out which button on the remote did what she wanted. I took me about an hour but it was time well spent. I truely recommend this for the husband who is techno savvy with a wife that isn't.
2,Radio Shack Equivalent,"I bought the device for TV, Cable, DVD, and Audio Sound Bar. The pre-programmed items only worked for TV and DVD. For Dish and the Sound Bar I had to manually program each function, and then I couldn't fully use each function.An e-mail request for advice to the manufacturer was not answered. Save your money and buy a Radio Shack cheap remote."
2,Didnt work for me,"The product was hard to configure. In addition to that, it does not work for all devices, especially the newer blu ray players."
1,The remote received is silver?!,"The picture shows a black remote. What I got in the mail is silver. Very disappointed about this, no matter how great the remote is. Shame on you Amazon."
4,Versatile Remote Control,"Purchased this remote control a few years ago when it was known as URC200.I've never been able to find out why the name (model No.)change but the remote isbasically the same.It's great when you purchase the transponder as well because the""Radio Freq."" of the unit comes into it's own. It does the job as claimed and worksvery well and is great value. If only the price of delivery was cheaper as I'vealmost paid the same price for delivery as for the remote."
3,How Jill copes with John!,"Jill Conway's True North did little to answer the question as to how a talented, ambitious, learned female copes with a manic-depressive husband. Actually, I was disappointed in finding out very little about John who must have been an incredible intellect, bon vivant, and wifely challenge. Jill may want to fulfill a need of many spouses dealing with a bipolar mate by writing a sequel."
3,Disappointing,"This book was strongly recommended to me by someone who had read The Road from Coorain. While the beginning, describing her days at Radcliffe, are interesting and well-written, the last 50-75 pages about the politics of academia are tedious and uninteresting. On the whole, far less inspiring than I'd hoped."
5,"YOUNG WOMEN, READ THIS! Find out now ...","I am grateful to Ms. Conway for baring the truth, as a service to those who need to hear it. I can see that her personal rantings have annoyed other readers, but my response was to the contrary. I have had similar experiences in the corporate world as a woman, and am grateful to find someone to back up my observations. Jill Conway proves that she will not back down to anyone who stands in the way of progress when she has a good idea, and those few who interpret it as antagonistic to their agendas, I suggest they re-examine said agendas, and not blame one of the few who actually succeeds in getting things done for the good, in spite of hopeless bureaucracy."
2,In agreement with the first reviewer,"This book was not as compelling as I had hoped. As an Antipodeam, I thought that Conway was unfair to Australia with her portrayal of its society. Her ideas about Australia seem to have been clouded by her unpleasant family life. I am also opposed to her portrayal of the United States in the 1960s as the land of true intellectual freedom and dedication. This ignores important and equally valuable contemporary Australian scholarship."
5,Really nice clear clothing bag,"Nice quality, great for any size rod since you use own own hanger in it.. Holds about 5 - 8 items on hangers. I plan on buying a few more."
4,Good product,"I really like this product. It was thinner and light than I had anticipated and would not do well if using for frequent travel, but I think it will be great for just hanging in the storage room. Love it and would buy another."
1,Toxic Material,Great product if you like exposure to toxic chemicals! Why would i keep a product that uses checmicals that cause cancer? They also don't say this in the product description but upon arrival i noticed it came with a warning tag!
5,Good quality,I am please with this product. It seems like its good quality and strong material. It also arrived rather quickly.
3,It was an Armani,"I'm disgusted to tell you that my Armani suit has moth holes in it. That sucks hard.Don't make the same mistakes. I'm just one man. I didn't realize what I was up against. For the sake of your suits, stop these wool eating, winged demons. I wish I had.This bag only holds 2 suits comfortably. 3's a crowd."
4,Best available English translation,"Of the various translations of Horace's Odes into English, this is the best I have found. The translations stay close to the literal meaning and sequence of the originals, yet are rendered into English poetry (not a prose crib.) Horace is a frequently complicated, dense poet, so the translations are often rather complicated and dense. A reasonable number of explanatory notes are provided in the back. My main reason for withholding a fifth star is the cheapness of the physical presentation: in order to save space, the poems are run together rather than being presented on separate pages, and the typeface is small."
1,Correction of previous review.,"My thanks to Mr Gordon Brown for commenting on my previous review. In that review I claimed that a weaker version of the Girasanov's theorem is proved ( this is correct)and that the author does this by impossing a weaker ( this should have read stronger, my apologies) condition. The remainder of my comments still stand. Specifically, it is not a priori clear form the premises that condition 4.3.1 on page 187, is indeed satisfied. Finally, Mr Gordon's last remark regarding the credibility of my person deserves no comment."
4,I love it but something is missing,"Both books are great! I think the only lack are in programming / computational (i.e R, S-Plus, Mathlab) examples and analysis."
5,Finally!,"Spun off BURKE'S LAW, HONEY WEST was a very short-lived show (just one season) but it had the incomparable Anne Francis as Honey and John Ericson as her sidekick Sam Bolt. I was eleven or twelve when I saw this show so my memories are kinda vague. Be interesting to see how it holds up today. (Remarkably, many shows from the 60's actually stand up pretty well because the driving principal behind them was to ENTERTAIN the audience. Household watching the most popular shows dwarf today's network audience size. Of course there were no cable or satellite channels or internet -- Al Gore hadn't invented the latter yet.)***New note***Having obtained the series since writing this, my childhood memories were vindicated."
4,Interesting blast from the past,"I had never even heard of the show ""Honey West"" until now. I was expecting something a bit campy with bad acting, but I was pleasantly surprised. As others have noted, the plots are a bit rushed, but the acting is good and the dialogue is frequently snappy.I suspect that anyone who was old enough to watch this show when it originally aired will know if they want to buy the set or not. Others might not be sure. If you already like shows from the era then definitely don't pass up on this one. It's dated, but it IS better than ""Gomer Pyle."" And if you're into the history of TV and how women have been depicted ""Honey West"" will open your eyes. Before ""Alias,"" there was ""Honey West."" It will make you wonder why there was 40 years between the two shows and there were so few programs with strong female action lead characters.I can't say this show has turned into my favorite series nor does it bring on any feelings of nostalgia. But it was interesting to watch."
5,no title,I thought for the age of this series & the way it was redone It is perferct I.m very satisfied. although it was in b/w it is great thank you
4,"For Fans Of The Show, Or Even New Viewers","I have to be honest, I wasn't familiar with HONEY WEST before the recent DVD release. It was sort of the 1960's version of ALIAS. Anne Francis is a private detective, on a different mission every week.The show is highly entertaining. It is fast paced with Anne Francis just wonderful in the lead.The DVD is very good. There are four discs containing all thirty episodes of the series. The black and white episodes look good. There are all sorts of fun extras as well, including vintage commercials for products from the mid 60's.If you were a fan of the show, you will definitely want this. Even if you never saw it, and enjoy the genre, it is worth picking up.It is great to see shows like this make it to DVD."
3,disappointing,"I was led to believe that this was the US equivalent of The Avengers. Not so. The plots are pure cops and robbers with the bad guys being criminals from lower class backgrounds who wear expensive clothes. The plots are very simple and have to be padded out to the 25 minute program length.Honey west is a wonderful person that everyone of both sexes would like to have as a friend, but she is a dim shadow compared to Cathy Gail (Honor Blackman) and Mrs. Peel. She is not smart and does not pretend to be. Her hand to hand combat skills are poor. She is frequently overcome by the bad guys and has to be rescued by her male partner. On the positive side, she has incredibly high ethics that everyone should aspire to.Most of the locations are mundane tourist attractions-hotels."
4,A fun look back to 1965,"I wasn't sure how a show like this would hold up, especially knowing that it aired almost two decades before I would be born. Honey West is a whole lot of fun, with the lovely Anne Francis busting the mold of what women on TV could do. The episodes are quick and entertaining. Nothing too deep to be found here, but you will find yourself coming back for more. Even if you don't like a particular episode, Anne Francis is always fun to watch, if you know what I mean."
2,so so,"I found this by accident and enjoyed it basically, but apparently the network wanted something more like the Avengers and the last half of the episodes are frequently too silly."
1,honey west,cant review something i never got. had too many excuses on why it is taking over a month to ship
5,Digitally Remastered Retro-ads!,"Two things stand out on this DVD set. The first is the well-endowed Ms. Francis walking around in her tight black cat-suit and black boots. The second is something I have NEVER seen before on DVD--beautiful, digitally restored ads from the 1960's, such as the ads for Parliament cigarettes, Prell shampoo, Lucky Strike, etc. The bright digital transfer of the episodes tends to bring out the cheap sets and production values. This is something that plagues other old shows such as ""Ironside"" and ""The Man From UNCLE"", but which also is part of their charm. Honey West comes off as more of a cartoon character than a real detective (obvious comparison--Emma Peel of ""The Avengers"") which makes for some fun TV. A unique show that was cancelled, ironically, because ABC found that they could order episodes of ""The Avengers"" for less money than producing ""Honey West""."
4,The Tap is. . .Good!,"While this album is not as good as their first it is still worth a listen for any Tap fan. The chorus of *** School sounds similar to the chorus of Hell Hole, but hey these guys are comedians, I'm happy that they can play half way decent music. This is a worthy follow up to This Is Spinal Tap."
3,Do you have a sense of humor?,"Made in CAN in 2000, Serial# 088-112-370-2, Playing Time: 50 min.First, a few corrections about the song listing: there are 14 tracks on this CD (not 13), and track 12 is called ""Clam Caravan"". This remastered version contains, unfortunately, no bonus tracks when compared to the original 1992 release. Track 13 has been once again omitted from all elements of the packaging (back panel and lyric booklet), and features a soft melody.The songs on this effort, the follow-up to their first venture ""This Is Spinal Tap"", is not as tongue-in-cheek as its predecessor, and the arrangements are a lot more elaborate. Still, the lyrics will make you chuckle, and are put to more-than-adequate rock. Some solid performances by a number of guests, particularly showcased on the title track.This is the kind of album you'll enjoy even more if you pay close attention to the words, particularly on ""Majesty Of Rock"" and ""Christmas With The Devil"", with lines like ""there's no snow in Hell""."
2,**,"For those that remember an immortal phrase from the original film, I thus dub this new soundtrack:S_ _ _ sandwich."
3,Chilton Manual,"I find this book somewhat helpful, but not detailed enough for a shady tree/Saturday mechanic and lacking some information that I thought would exist (i.e. - removal of the headlight assembly). To be honest, online forums provided me with the type of information that I needed specific to my year/make/model Toyota 4Runner."
1,Deluded,"Wondering why this rubbish has no negative reviews? Adnan Oktar who hires ghost writers to churn out volumes of 'Harun Yahya' rubbish has very good lawyers - it seems that my previous negative review was removed. Why has he such good lawyers? - he needs them: check out the ""Legal issues, arrest, trial, and sentencing"" section on the Adnan Oktar Wikipedia entry to see what a despicable character Mr Oktar is."
5,very good,"The $10 house-brand keyboard I bought with my latest laptop broke right away, so I sprung for a decent keyboard. The Lenovo is as good as any I've ever used. The touch is a little light for me, but the unit itself is solid and responsive. I -wanted- a corded keyboard. Good ones are getting harder to find, and I'm glad this one was available."
4,Good general keyboard!,"Great keyboard with 2 levels of height adjustment in the back. It's Lenovo, so you know its good quality. good look, very techie, and a nice feel for the price."
4,I like it,"Good quality except the hand support. It doesn't conncet the keyboard very well, hand it will shake if you move the beyboard."
2,Just another regular keyboard,"Some of the reviewers here mentioned that this keyboard feels like a Thinkpad laptop keyboard. No, it doesn't. It is just another regular keyboard and nothing more then that. I am very disappointed."
5,NICE AND CLICKY,"I purchased this keyboard because I wanted:1. Clicky FOR LESS THAN 100.00 (Hard to find)2. Well spaced keys3. A mechanical feel and good key return4. No bells and whistles5. Old School6. No chintzy, thin plastic... good solid build.It is all these things... the details:There are clickier/louder keyboards out there, but not at this price point.The keys are spaced just rightThe keys go down far when pressed and have a nice, quick, mechanical type returnThis keyboard doesn't light up or have 100 ""hotkeys"" It is for typing.It's solid, good, stuff.Looking for a nice typing keyboard that doesn't feel mushy? Don't want to spend an arm and leg for it? This is, in my opinion, after three years of use - the best option.CLICKETY CLICKETY CLICKETY ;)Important: the palm rest you see can be left off, for that old school feel, but its actually kind of nice, to my surprise."
3,Nice keyboard but overpriced.,"This keyboard is pretty-much what you would expect it to be, a no-nonsense keyboard that has a nice tactile response without all the crazy extra gizmo buttons. There isn't a single negative thing about it other than the price-- I could've gotten a comparable Logitech keyboard for about $20. Oh well, you win some, you lose some."
4,Solid keyboard,"I needed another keyboard for an older IBM Thinkpad and chose this one. It is solid and has a good feel. I dont use the track pad on the ThinkPad and this keyboard does not have one. If you use a trackpad, you may want a different keyboard that includes the trackpad."
1,Horrible keyboard - Stay away!,"Bought it and returned it, this is a horrible keyboard, it's very hard to use, the keys are soft with no good feedback, it is also pretty ugly... reminds me of keyboards from the 80s - stay away!"
3,"Not the worst flavor, not the best flavor","For those not in the know, Clif bars are great to eat if you're on the run or if you just need a little extra boost of energy before you hit the gym.Myself, I'll eat one in the morning along with an apple or piece of fruit for breakfast. Then, on days where I either lift or swim in the afternoon, I'll eat another one about an hour before my workout. I've found that doing so puts my energy level right where I want it to be by the time I start my workout.Cranberry Apple Cherry isn't my favorite flavor, but it's not the worst, either. It certainly has more of a ""trail mix"" flavor than any of the other ones I've tried."
3,"Nutritious, almost delicious","Maybe I'm spoiled by the other great flavors of Clif bars, but I wasn't terribly impressed by ""Cranberry Apple Cherry"". It's certainly not the worst thing ever - they're quite edible - but it's probably not a flavor I'll buy again.If you want a fruity Clif bar flavor, allow me to recommend the ""Black Cherry Almond"" flavor - I give it a 5 out of 5, rivaling the peanuty and choclatey Clif bars."
4,Good mid-day snack on a long day.,"I picked up some indivual bars at the local Target, and after vomiting out some of the more nasty varieties I came to this one & loved it! Great taste and not as 'heavy' as some of the other types of Clif bars.As always with Clif bars be sure to have some water somewhere near by, they can dry out your mouth rather fast."
2,Product not as expected.,"Be prepared for a 30+ minute install on this application. I hate the fact that it loads so many 3rd party applications. It also installs the .NET 1.1 framework. Not only do you have to enter the product key to install, you have to wait for an email and enter other keys just to get other components working.I run this softrware on a RAID 0 - 3.4 GHZ - 1 GB Ram computer and it still runs slow. It takes almost 30 seconds just to load the program and I have the best hardware money can buy right now. Program has crashed and hung several times but that can be expected since it's not a solid product written by a single company.I've had better luck with Sonic Studio. I only purchased this for the hardware that allows composite and S-Video inputs to USB 2.0 port. That seems to be okay, it's just the software I don't like."
1,Keep away from this software,"I did an upgrade from Version 9 to Version 10. I loaded the software three times and could not get the ""features"" unlocked. The software runs very slow on a computer that ran the older software well. The online support suggestions don't work and noone answers the support line.I am asking for a refund."
2,Pinnicle Studio 500-USB (not a bargain),"I could have put a little more thought into the decision to buy it that I did. It is ""bare bones"" not much more than an adapter to adapt and old camcorder or VCR to your computer. However, it has proved to be dependable and reliable has no shorts tranfers same quality as tape.It comes with Studio standard 10 w/bonus CD which is completely out dated and not much more than a demo. I purchased a copy of Studio 11 plus w/ ultimate upgrade which is the current. I get you get what you pay for and I got what I paid for. I paid for an adapter and that just what I got. Buy a Dazzle or something other than this kit you'll probably be happier in the long run."
5,What They Don't Teach You at the GIA,"Very concise and informative book on the exact hows, whats and whys of gem dealing at the source.The author lives in Minas Gerais state, ""general mines"" in Portuguese, the busy trading area in Brasil. The book casts light on how buying and selling is really done in the trading towns setup near the mining districts.Excellent information. You won't learn anything about what's in this book by studying at the GIA. Of course, you need the GIA to be able to grade and identify stones. But then you'll need this book to successfully trade and market them."
1,doesn't work,"I took good care of this expensive item.I kept the covers closed (except for when it was dark).Thinking my batteries were dead, I bought more batteries. That didn't work.I would love to change my ""I hate it"" rating if i could just getsomeone to tell me what needs to be done to make it work...without the usualou're a retard"" comments some insecure shady sellers prefer to degrade people with.Sell quality items and people won't have these problems. Or, at least offer good repair service.People with $500 to blow aren't stupid."
4,Would a person see the illuminator or any light from these?,"Would a person looking at me, while i was wearing these see them... are they covert? Could you look through a rifle scope with these and shoot (in a pinch)?"
5,Excellent book,Great teaching book for all medical students. The CD-Rom is a real bargain. Congratulations to the authors.
5,Very helpfull book,A very practical book for paramedics. Lots of great diagrams. Really helpfull to learn suturing techniques. Would be great for army medics or ER nurses.
5,LOVE!!!,"My fiance got this wonderful little charm for me as a reward when I quit smoking. I wasn't sure if I'd like it when I read about the size.As soon as it arrived and I opened it, I knew it was perfect! It's got a nice weight. It's beautiful. It's sturdy (I've been wearing it 24/7 for about 6 months now and haven't had any issues). It has moving wings and its head turns slightly from side to side.I've received tons of compliments on it as well! I'm saving the page for it so if anything does happen to the one I've got, I can buy a new one."
4,Very informative!,"This is a pretty good video. It's an educational and more historical perspective on this legend than the embellished, but good movies out there! I enjoyed it very much."
4,Comment on the Size,"This bag is indeed 22""x16"", but that INCLUDES the part you need to fold over to keep things dry... Knowing this, I would have ordered at least one size larger. This bag is a good size for a canoe or kayak day trip. I have an adult (short sized - i'm short) sleeping bag, which does fit inside this dry bag. I'd have to compress the sleeping bag to fit more inside it though. I won't return it, because we have 2 kayaks. So if I plan an overnight kayak trip, I'll just order another larger bag and have 2. I have a sit-on-top kayak, so the entire deck gets wet when paddling. It kept my spare clothes dry. Next time I go out, i'll dunk it & see if the contents get damp. The packaging included a disclaimer that it isn't designed to keep electronics dry.It does seem like a good value for the $$ though."
3,Need to add to library,"I feel a special love for this film since it was filmed in the old hospital where I live before they tore it down to build a new one. And my dad was one of the extras in the movie too. He played one of the psych patients in the basement! So I always get a kick out of hearing my dad's stories about playing dominos with Bob Saget and Rich (as my dad called him)Pryor on filming breaks.This is not Pryor's best film, but this film is chock full of characters that keep you laughing all the way. Pryor is going to be missed! He was a comedic icon. 12-10-2005"
3,Pretty good,i feel this film was Hit&miss.more Hits but the misses are there.Richard does a good job but the material isn't fully developed for his character.like with his Love interest Rachel Ticotin.and what about Garrett Morris? as funny as he is he should have gotten more ad-libs at least.should have been a better film.
5,critical condition/the toy,I ENJOYED ALLOF RICHARD PRYOR MOVIE AND TAPES. IT WAS FUNNY AND ENJOYABLE
5,1-Star People Are Shallow Resellers - THIS CD ROCKS !!!,"If you enjoy bands like U2, Nickelback, Matchbox 20, Dexter Freebish, Breaking Benjamin, Vertical Horizon, Lifehouse, and any other group that thoroughly rocks, this album is for you. Out of 12 songs, I loved about 9. The others probably will grow on me, as with any album. It's a great listen. Of course if you're only listening to a 20 second sound bite, so you can judge how it will resell on Ebay, you may be unsure. The 1-star folks are majorly confused and should stick to their Lawrence Welk collection. Chris has built a great CD, and the arrangements work well. Slash is a nice addition on track 7. Listen and enjoy. Shun the bozos. They're always out there spinning their negativity."
5,AWESOME!!,"LOVE Chris Daughtry and LOVE his new album! ""Its not over"" wouldn't be my first choice to release as I have my favorites but still awesome!"
3,Slow delivery,Product was new as stated but delivery-even tho it came in the allotted time frame-was SLOW.How long can it take to mail and deliver a CD??
5,SHOULD HAVE BEEN.....BUT GLAD HE WASN'T,"This is the best idol debut from any idol. Thinking back I was mad when he was voted off. I felt it was rigged like so many other people. Now looking back I think everything happens for a reason, what would he have put out if he won look at Taylor Hicks not that I think he should have won but his cd isn't anything compared to his performance. It is sitting on the shelf. Would Chris have as much control of his music if he won, I dont believe so. This is a great cd well produced and written. When I listen to it I can hear bunch of hits from Its Not Over the current single but Home, Over You would also do well. I say if you dont have it go back and order it."
3,Daughtry,"It's a good CD; haven't listened to it much, but I am more impressed with Chris than I was when he was on Idol."
4,"Great Voice, Mediocre Lyrics","While Chris has the power voice that comes along once in a decade, the lyrics are at best so-so and the music, for the most part, tedious after the first five songs. Team up with a great lyricist, get a professional arranger (whoever did this didn't work enough), and your sophomore album will be even greater!Still recommended..."
5,This is the Best Rock Album in Years!,"Chris Daughtry has really made it big!!!!! His album has grit, soul, and some really great guitar. The vocals remind me of some of the great artists from the late 70's to early 80's. Journey, Bon Jovi, Kansas, Boston, etc. all of these bands had great vocals and great instruments and could rock the house. So can Chris and he's just getting started! Keep it coming Chris!"
3,Daughtry has lots to offer,"I baught this CD for my 13 year old son. He (and I) was very impressed with Chris on American Idol, a real rock trooper. Although I have only scanned throught the songs on the CD I can see that Chris has brought all his rock talents to the it. My son is very happy with it, I have heard it eminating loudly around the house on many occasions. Purchasers should however be aware that the selection of songs he performed on Idol are superior to that on the CD, with a few exceptions. It's a great pity that he didn't or perhaps couldn't make a CD of his Idol songs, that would have been a real Rock Gem. But I guess he wants to make his own mark now, and who can blame him for that. Overall, if you like Chris you should like this, but you may feel that some of the songs are a little weak."
5,Better than I hoped,"I loved Chris all the way through the show and expected him to win like most other people. When he left, I was shocked, but I knew he would make a comeback. I have been listening to country music for the last 15 years, but Chris' CD makes me remember that there is other great music out there. Chris outdid himself on this one. One thing I like about it is that it is not really hard rock, but would still be considered rock and you can sing to it easily. Most songs have a catchy beat. I have had it for about 2 weeks and have listened to it a lot. I have Kelly's CD and plan to buy Taylor and Katharine's, but so far, Chris is the winner by a long shot! Great writing Chris and stay true to your roots! I plan to buy every other CD he ever makes. Chris, you are awesome."
5,Daughtry,He was by far the most talented singer on American Idol and now his cd proves it. Excellent cd from start to finish. A+
5,Rock On!,"While im not the biggest rock fan of rock music, i must say this cd is pretty good. Chris is very cute and his look and also music will get him far."
4,Daughtry is great. The album is overproduced,"Daughtry has a fantastic voice for singing power rock. Many of the tracks allow his voice to shine through. The album overall is a bit overproduced with the chimey , massively processed choruses through out. Still, the album is a good listen for fans of the genre. Clearly the intent is to make sure that the record spawns radio hits. Hopefully, after Chris gets some money in the bank and out of the AI contract, he can make an album with a little less pop and a little more rock."
5,Great!!,"I knew Chris was good when I watched American Idol. I even adored him afterwards but when I recieved my copy of Daughtry, I was in awe. His vocals are amazing. the album is even better than I expected. I am so glad that he wow'ed me instead of disappointing me!"
4,Solid Debut Effort!!!,"Chris was mine and my wife's pick to win this last season of American Idol. With this debut effort, he proves why he should have won. His vocals are still as solid as his performances on idol. He has stayed true to the sound that made him a crowd favorite. Chris has some real good rock songs on here along with pop/rock. My only complaint with this album is that it reminds me too much of a Nickleback CD. Don't get me wrong, I like Nickleback. I was just hoping Chris would have a sound all his own. Nevertheless, it is still a good debut CD. I see a great career ahead. Way to go Chris!!!"
4,Great CD,"I loved Chris with Absent Element, so I was very excited for this CD. If I could give it 4 1/2 stars, I would give it that, but I don't think it was quite 5 stars. The thing I liked so much about him and Absent Element is that they were different. It was hard rock, but not something I felt like I couldn't listen to with my kids in the car. Daughtry is good, and I enjoy it, but it's too mainstream. That's a good thing, because it'll probably appeal to more people, which means the CD will sell more copies, and that's what I hope for Chris, but I was a little disappointed.The songs are all good, right now I think my favorite is What I Want. There isn't a track on this CD that I don't like, though. I would definitely recommend this CD, but if you loved Absent Element, don't expect the same sound here."
5,You gotta love it!!,"Ever since watching him perform What If on Idol... I have loved what Chris does. This album is amazing and I will be listening to it constantly, can't wait for the next one!"
5,"Good, start to finish...","If you like rock, you shouldn't be disappointed with this CD. From start to finish it is strong. There are 8 songs that you could easily find yourself listening to on the radio. I recommend it highly."
5,AWESOME!,"WOW! What a great CD! I absolutely love Chris Daughtry's soulful rock voice and his songs are all ones you'll be singing :-) He reminds me a lot of Fuel and Nckelback, but with his own distinct style. Best CD I've heard in a long time."
4,Well Pleased,I was well pleased indeed with this entire CD. Ihave listened to all of the CD's from the other American Idols and this is one of the best I've heard. I loved his deep resonating voice.
5,Daughtry CD is AWESOME!,"I'm actually glad that he didn't win American Idol because I think he's doing swesome without them! This CD is great! Great songs! If you are thinking about buying it, I highly recommend it!"
3,I though it would rock more...,"Although most of the songs on this album are... pretty good, I wanted to hear Chris Daughtry not Nickelback. I thought Daughtry would bring it a little harder than this. All these songs are a little soft and well, honestly, girly. I AM a woman, and I do love the rock ballads, but I really expected something more exciting and edgy out of this hot man. Even if he kept some of these songs, but mixed in some with a little more ROCK to them... but ALL of them are a different version of the same thing and ALL of them sound like Nickleback songs... except Nickelback sometimes actually rocks."
4,Love it!,A feel good and in love album! Keep the music coming! Great for everyday listening and keeps toes tapping and romance in the heart.
5,Awesome,Best c.d Daughtry has EVER made. The c.d came in its original package with no scratches or marks on it
5,Daughtry Rocks!,Daughtry rocks! I'll admit I haven't purchased any other idol cds before Daughtry but this cd is definitely worth every penny! I'm anxiously awaiting the next album!
4,Finally a rocker American Idol,"Not a fan of American Idol, but started hearing some new music on my radio dial. At first I thought it was Nickelback, the music styles are similar. Then hearing the the song with Slash, I finally broke down and bought it. It's a very nice album really, lots of hits will come of this cd I'm sure."
5,Awesome!,I loved him on American Idol and I couldn't wait for his CD. It was worth the wait! It's one of my favorites and I play it all the time.
5,Chris Daughtry Fan from the Beginning,"Since buying his CD a few months ago, I have listened to it everyday! I listen to it so much that my 4 y.o. son knows the words to his songs too, especially Home. All the songs are great, especially Used to, Over you, There and Back Again, What about Now, What I Want, It's Not Over and Home. I am truly a Chris Daughtry fan and am looking forward to seeing him in concert in July!"
1,He can do a lot Better Than This CD,"very disappointed in daughtry's cd. every song was the same screaming and sounded like the same sound tract. cound't hear any words. hard to listen to the whole cd.chris was my favorite on AI and i was mad when he was kicked out early. maybe a lot of people knew a heck of a lot more than me. at least, he's still out there trying. i'm still a fan-good luck Chris!!AI fan"
1,never received,"I would love to give you a review, but I have never received this product and it was paid for. I will never order anything from amazon. com again."
5,"Bought it for my son, ended up loving it myself","He rooted for Chris, I rooted for Taylor. He wins. So does Chris. Nice freshman effort."
3,Redundancy,"I like Chris Daughtry, I like his voice. One thing you need to consider when buying this album is the majority of his songs sound the same. Great vocals, but I got tired of the same sound over and over. So, I'm rating it right in the middle. Maybe I don't get the style of music, but for me, I need a little more variety to rank it higher. I'm looking forward to his next release, hoping it will have more variety and show more of his vocal talent."
4,Excellent album that gets better with each listening.,"If you like music that pumps you up and can sing along to it's right here. Chris' song writing really touches chords everyone can relate to without being sickly sweet or predictable. It's artists like Chris that give American Idol credibility as a discoverer of new talent. All in all, it's a great intro album and makes me look forward to see how he grows in his sophomore effort."
5,"You'll wear the disc out before you're sick of it, it's THAT good!","I have to admit, I came late to the Chris Daughtry fandom. But when I heard ""It's Not Over"" I thought it was a great song, and I wanted to support him since he was so obviously robbed of the top American Idol spot last season. Well, support shmupport, this CD is awesome! I've hardly listened to anything else since I bought it. It's a rare thing when you like EVERY track on a CD, and this is one of those rare cases. I especially love Track 8. Chris' voice is amazing on it! And so excited to hear that it's doing so well!Other great tracks, Home, Over You, pretty much every other track!!! Just go buy this, don't even contemplate it!"
5,Luv luv luv this album!!,I have loved Chris since the AI days & thinks he is only getting better n better if that is even possible. Love track #4 Start of Something New.
5,Daughtry,I thoroughly enjoyed this debut Daughtry album. It has many memorable songs included and I can't wait to purchase further recordings by him.
5,Best CD I've bought in a long time,"I was extremely surprised with Daughtry's first CD. I knew it would be good, but I never thought it would become my new favorite CD. Every single song on it is great, and I've been listening to it nonstop for the past two weeks. My favorites are Used To, It's Not Over, Over You, Home, and All These Lives. All songs have a great rhythm, and they never get old! Overall, this CD is a must buy. Highly recommended."
4,"CHRIS, YOU ARE AN AWESOME ARTIST",I loved his album. The only reason I didn't rank it a 5 is because most of the songs had the same 'tune' about it. There wasn't much variety to it. BUT his voice is amazing & he sounded aaaaawwweeesoooommmeee!!!
2,Same ole same ole,"First before every Chris fan jumps on me...this is a CD for all of YOU.I purchased this CD because of the wonderful things I had read about it. What a waste of my money! Every track sounded the same!True story, while I was listening to it my daughter asked me when I started liking Nickelback...Chris does right by his fans and the fans of every head banger out there...sounds the same..screams the same...to each their own..me, I guess I will stick to real music."
5,BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"All of the songs are great, but a couple stick out. 1) It's not over. Very catchy song, great tune(I believe it is the theme songs for one of the fox shows); 2) Home - Brilliant and beautiful; 3) What I want, great tune; 4) There and back again, NOW this one is hard to the core, can totally see myself at a concert with this song; 5) what about now, another awesome one.Trust me when I say, you will not be disapointed in this CD. Truly worth the money you pay for it."
2,"So repetitive, you'll think your CD is skipping","Do you remember how shocked Chris was when he was voted off American Idol? You'll be shocked when you hear how every song sounds the same on this album. It's not a bad song, but after after hearing it 12 times, you kind of get tired. Daughtry has talent, but he needs writers. This album is doing well enough to warrant another release, let's hope he goes a different route, and injects some variety into his next album."
1,Broken promises . . . .,"I am so bummed about this CD. If you are a fan of his Absent Element stuff, you will be really disappointed in this CD, at least I am - even Slash couldn't save him. Such a waste of an incredible voice and talent. It is just really different - more like stuff that they would play on American Idol - very safe and no personality. On a few of the songs, I couldn't tell if he was making a country song or a rock song. He even managed to ruin ""Breakdown,"" (a song on his Absent Element CD) and totally mellowed it out. ""There and Back Again"" was pretty good and almost made me give this CD 2 stars, but I couldn't cause I want to know: WHERE'S THE ROCK AT CHRIS? I thought he promised us edgy stuff? Guess that stuff doesn't sell as well to the general public. If anyone wants a free CD - email me and I'll mail you mine for free."
1,At least he tried!,If you are into Nickelback or Creed you will like this one because all the tracks sound just like they were taken off of their albums. But its not my cup of tea!
1,No Variety...It All Sounds The Same,"I'm not even going to buy this CD. I listened to all the samples, and all the songs sound alike. I liked him at 1st on American Idol, until I saw he can only do ""Creed"" impressions. He has no Variety. Take Kiss for example...""hard rockin"" music. Then they came out with ""Beth"". Whitesnake, ""hard rockin"". then they come out with ""Is This Love""Daughtry sounds too much like the same songs, over and over and over.Not even worth it. Save your money"
1,Why two prices?,"Check Amazon's listing for ""Daughtry - Deluxe Edition"", and you'll find two listings. One for $16.99....the other for $9.99! The exact same album, but two different prices. What's more....for example, the song ""It's Not Over"" is $.99 from one album, but $1.29 from the other....same artist, same track, same song, same running time TWO PRICES! Does this happen often? BTW....I rate it one star for Amazon's pricing policy........the album is FIVE STAR!!!"
2,wanted something harder!,I watched Chris on American Idol and was really expecting a better cd from him!I really like his voice but this cd is for old people...when i listen to rock i want METAL!NOT sappy Bon Jovi style cheesy love ballads...
5,Great CD,I just bought the CD and instanly enjoyed every song. I would highly recommend this CD. All the songs are very good.
1,Blah!,"More of the same old, same old, rocker. Not very appealing or interesting music. It sounds fabricated and every song sounds the same. Not my kind of music. Sorry, but I hate it. Keeping it real!"
1,Must be the looks.,"I noticed that most of the reviewers of this album were females, and yes Chris is a handsome guy, but really are you serious? You have to review with your ears, not your eyes. There's nothing that sets this album apart from the typical corporate/top 40 rock that we haven't already heard from 3 Doors Down/Nickleback/Stained,you fill in the rest. Don't waste your money on this one, instead pick up a copy of Rockstar Supernova."
3,Not received,This CD was never received by me. However when I reported this to Amazaon they were very prompt with their response. I recevied a full refund of all postage and costs so I was happy with that. It's a pity I didn't get the CD though but it was probably a problem in the post office.
1,Just not my style of music,Songs don't do much for me. The only one I like somewhat is What About Now.
2,Songs Suing in Screaming Form,"Daughtry was, by far, the most talented singer on last season's Idol. In fact, Katherine cannot even begin to dream of having as good of a voice with her watered down, weak, pitchy voice. Hicks is a good singer, but not original and a performing fool. Daughtry disappoints those who were disappointed by his departure from the show way too early. The songs are screamed and seem untrue to his own style. Idol, once again, took a very good voice and ""engineered"" it to fit a certain - already done too much style - just to sell to the masses who buy only one type of sound. I predict his recording career will be over very soon."
2,Same old same old,I personally have thought all along that Chris Daughtry sounds like every other rock musician out there. I for one would like to hear something I haven't heard in a long time or never before. I would not recommend this album.
1,More of the same,This album is terrible. He just can't sing - all he does is scream. One star was too much. Why this guy is getting any kind of fame I'll never know.
3,"Daughtry has some potential, but this CD is just OK","I like Chris D's voice and his style but was hoping more of the track's on this CD would have had a real edge to them. After a few plays, this disc will probably end up mostly forgotten in my collection. (Still, this rocker-style Idol freshman effort is way better than Bo Bice's was.)"
3,Where's 'walk the line'?,Starts off OK but quickly slips into average. Where is that brilliant rendition of the Johnny Cash song?
3,Daughtry,"I really liked Chris on American Idol, but I was disappointed with his first album. I think the band was too strong and covered up the tone of his voice. I didn't find myself being particularly drawn to any one song or going away singing the lyrics. The songs tended to blend in to each other. I wish it was a little happier and a little lighter somehow. I wish Chris's incredible voice would have been showcased more."
5,Nice blend of top 40 hits and some rockin' guitar jams,"This CD will definitely catapult Chris into a big name musical act. He has a lot of cross over potential with adult contemporary to alternative rock all on the same CD. THERE AND BACK is my favorite - it's crisp and rocks the most and actually has a positive message to it. Also, my favorite slower rock anthems are HOME and BREAKDOWN. Originally when I heard Breakdown for the first time, I didn't like it as much as on the Absent Element album because the song was slowed down for this CD and isn't as edgy, but now, I can really hear his vocal range clearly which more than makes up for the tempo change. Rock on Chris - I'll definitely buy his next."
1,"Chris daughtry? WOW, doesn't sound like it!","this CD was bad, i didn't even like any of the songs, They all pretty much sounded the same, yah, he has a good voice but the songs sound the same! Thats not 21st century people want!"
5,A Fine Debut,"Chris is so much more talented then all those guys who are currently on American Idol. Just put this cd on and you'll see why. I never thought he was an ""Idol"" show type he seemed kind of a little more edgy then those folks. His band is great and he can sing a song can't he!!! I am very happy I bought this cd."
1,Completely unoriginal garbage,"I'm willing to bet most of this guy's fans are either young teenagers (who will buy anything) middle aged mothers(and maybe some fathers) who don't have a clue about what good music is, or, girls/women who just think he's ""hot"". This entire album is commercial watered down garbage. I knew it was going to be bad before i heard it, but I listened to it so I could write an educated review. All the songs sound alike. No originality, no creativity. He has a little vocal talent, but it doesn't help much at all. Anyone who thinks this is good music needs some serious education."
5,A W E S O M E,"Chris Daughtry is by far the most talented of all of the Idols in the 5 years of American Idol. The rest are amazing, but Chris surpasses amazing. This CD is terrific. I can not believe this guy was not discovered sooner. I cant wait for the next CD. If you like Nickelback, you will like Daughtry. This guy has it going on big time."
5,old arguments,isn't it time the idol show fans gave up their petty fights how juvenile is this. Apparently the buying public is making up their own minds on this album and embracing it. Not to shabby that It's not over is the background song for number one program on tv prison break. You'll probably see it during nfl today. The album is wonderful with amazing vocals. This young man is a treasure. By the way I am 65 been a rocker for years and the last time I enjoyed anyone so much it was Elvis. But Elvis is in a class by himself and no one can compare. Chris Daughtry is in his own genre and does his own thing beautifully. To bad the bonus song on Itunes SORRY is not on the main album it is unbelievable.
5,LOVE this. Highly recommend!,Chris Daughtry delivers. I was a fan when he was on American Idol and am a bigger fan after hearing this CD.
5,Amazing,"Well I bought this CD for my partner at Christmas as he was a big fan of Chris on American Idol - I have to say that since I heard it I cant stop playing it! Its a fantastic album and its nice to see that Chris has co- written all the songs - true talent. Im really pleased that I bought it, although my partner would like it back now. Well done Chris and keep up the good work."
4,Good for Chris,"Are my co-worker and I 38 year old, hip, female, music lovers that can't help but adore Chris Daughtry!?...yes BUT I also happen to appreciate a large diversity of music and she is a country fan and we love this guy. I felt strongly that I wanted to support this album and pre-ordered one for us both. BUY THIS ALBUM. Yes you know he would've done something a bit more hard and raw if it wasn't produced by Simon!! Yes it is a bit pop BUT he is amazingly talented and if you truly appreciately artistry YOU WILL IMMEDIATELY BE ABLE TO PICK OUT THE SONGS HE WROTE SOLELY without even cheating by looking at the credits. They are certainly the best tracks and the rock/alt country cross over sound which we appreciate from Chris Daughtry."
5,Awesome CD- he should have been the American Idol,This CD is one of the best I have heard in a while. All of the songs are very good.
5,Amazing voice!,"This CD is unbelievable! Why he didn't win American Idol, blows my mind. The style of this CD resembles Nickelback but maybe a little softer. Even if you don't like this kind of music, you'll love his voice. I hghly recommend this CD to anyone and everyone!"
4,Good CD.,"Bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. She normally listens to harder rock, this is a little more mainstream poppy kind of music, but she likes it anyway. She originally saw Chris on Am. Idol and liked him on the show. All in all a good purchase."
5,One word review: Awesome!,"This is an awesome album. From the first time I heard him perform a cover of Fuel's on Americon Idol I 'knew' this guy was going to go places. There are times that words just won't do, and that was one of them.It's worth renting/buying a copy of Americon Idol just to hear Chris Daughtry perform that cover."
2,Repetitive,I was looking forward to this album but was very disappointed. I found it very 'samey' in that all the tracks seemed to blend into one sound. For fans of hard rock only I'm afraid.
2,Pretty Generic,"You can play this back to back with most of the Adult Contemporary Rock and you wouldn't be able to pick it out if a crowd. Like anything from American Idol, it plays pretty much safe to the middle. There is nothing groundbreaking here at all. There are some good songs and the guy does have charisma but, it begins to blend in with the woodwork after a awhile because you have heard it all before."
2,Generic songs from a great singer...,"OK,,,Chris CAN sing, but it seems that THEY got a hold of him and his album is so typical, its disgusting. There isnt one shred of originality on it. I cant believe the SOOOOO generic ""Its all over"" is now number 1. I guess American Idol fans must be blinded by lack of orginality. I hope Chris can get past this crap, and really ROCK, like I know he can."
3,Not great...but entertaining,"I like Chris Daughtry's voice a lot. However, many of the songs sound the same. It is a good first CD. Before I'd buy his album, I would listen to most of the songs."
2,"On Idol, A Refreshing Change...But This Ain't An Idol World...","Poor Chris Daughtry. What's an American Idol also-ran to do? Throughout the competition he was the odds-on favorite to win until the very night he was voted off in lieu of the caterwauling Katherine McPhee. Despite the audible gasps from the over-reacting audience, let's get one thing clear: in the realm that was Idol, he was a refreshing breath of crisp, unadulterated air. Unfortunately, in the outside world, he would win the Nickelback Karaoke Contest. And that is the pitfall we have here [and there are no pits to fall farther than Nickelback]. There is no range or depth to his music, you've heard it all before on today's rock radio, for better or worse. My grade: B-"
1,Chris Daughtry CD Good but CD cases always arrive broken!!!,"I've really liked Chris Daughtry's music ever since he appeared on American Idol. Of course, I like some songs better than others. My major complaint is about receiving the CD's broken. They ""ALWAYS"" end up being cracked when I get them. For this reason, I'm not buying another CD from Amazon. I gave the item one star because of the condition of the case, not the music itself. I think people should be aware of how stuff arrives. Maybe Amazon will change things."
3,Great voice - poor music!,"What a waste of Daughtry's beautiful voice. The session band, skilled musicians as they are, missed the point. the roaring background music drowning out the wonderful vocals really turned me off! I was deeply dissapointed with this CD. Hopefully Daughtry will get much better a presenting his obvious talents."
5,DAUGHTRY- AMERICA'S IDOL,"Love this guy's voice and music. He is just so yummy! He has a beautiful, sexy, smoky voice. If you voted for Taylor or Katherine, you didn't listen very well. Try Daughtry! You will be surprised."
5,A Must Have!!!,"All I can say is, flippin brilliant! This is NOT an album that you buy and there ends up only being one song on it you like. No, EVERY song is great! If you like a bit of rock and songs you can really let go and sing along with this is the album to have. Is excellent when mowing the lawns, working out at the gym, or those long road trips, or pretty much any time of the day. Best song on the album has got to be Home.I would recommend this album to anyone, I do believe you will all love it :-) Buy it now!!"
3,They all sound the same,"Bought this for my husband. We loved Chris' music on American Idol. This album is good, all the songs are good, but after about the third song, they all really start to sound the same. He's a good singer, but you have to be in the mood to listen to all the songs. If you have a multiple CD shuffler this would be good as then you wouldn't have to listen to the songs one after another."
3,Utterly depressing......,"If you're looking for an album to slit your wrists by, then by all means, this is it. I was all set for what I guess was ""vindication for Chris"", having been ousted by Taylor and ""Malibu Barbie"", but this is just....depressing. If he gets another chance (which don't come often in this eat-or-be-eaten industry), a severe ""course change"" needs to be in order."
3,mediocre,"I would have liked Chris to put some heavy rock on this CD, but he didn't. The song choices are boring and generic. I dig Chris's voice, the dude can belt it out, but cmon, did he really intend to put people to sleep? If he did, then it worked *zzzzzzzzzzzz*"
5,Great Album,I enjoy a variety of music and I always would hear Daughtry while in the gym but never purchased any of their music until now. This is worth the money. Great music.
5,Daughtry CD,Yeow!!!!! Awesome awesome awesome! Pure Chris Pure Rock! All you ever thought he could be and more!!!!
1,Really?,"Chris Daughtry was the most interesting Idol, the only one who seemed to be as much artist as singer. He does not prove it here with a balls-to-the-wall onslaught of MTV-ready noise. I was hoping for something more."
3,Great voice - overproduced and formulaic,"Chris Daughtry has a great voice and I already knew that. This CD was a little disappointing to me. It seemed a bit formulaic and overdone at times. Some of the cheesy guitar effects (like in ""Gone"") were not good and the mix was overproduced at times, with vocals getting lost. There were a couple songs that were Nickleback clones. ""All These Lives"" was a dead ringer for ""How you remind me"" - go ahead, listen to them back-to-back! Other songs were quite good. Overall not a bad debut album - I can only hope that once the band gels and sounds less like an assembly of randomly hired studio musicians, Daughtry could turn into a great rock band."
4,"Forget American Idol, introducing the ROCK STAR!!!!","I was really skeptical of what would happen since most of the American Idol stuff out is junk. Thats right junk. Just massed produced pop junk. This the first American Idol cd that has been rocking enough to buy and rock it does! Thank goodness Chris kept his edge unlike Bo Bice. Songs are very catchy and easily get stuck in your head. Chris's vocals are fantastic. Great rock tracks. The only thing that keeps this from being 5 stars is the lack of guitar solos on some songs. I am definitely an old school rocker, Motley Crue, KISS, AC/DC, etc. This one is worth picking up as long as you can forget he was associated with American Idol."
3,Break Out,"Ok; I'm one of the one's that watched Daughtry on American Idol. I picked this up because it was on sale. It's a good cd , but I don't think it's anything to knock you off your feet. Average songs with average time lengths provides some okay listening. The only reason that this is at the top of the charts because of the exposure on American Idol. The true test will come with his sophmore release and hopefully, he gets rid of the record label's influence. Daughtry has the potential to make a killer cd, but he needs to find his niche because with this release he sounds too much like Nickelback or Default and I guess I'll throw in Fuel, but at best it's just a collection of catchy pop songs and not breaking any new ground."
5,"""YOU WAS ROBBED""","WAY TO GO CHRIS!!!!YOU HAVE PROVEN THROUGH THIS RECORDING THAT YOU WERE ROBBED OF THE ""AMERICAN IDOL"" TITLE...YOU HAVE A VOCAL GIFT THAT ANY GROUP WOULD LIKE FROM A FRONT MAN.THE MATERIAL IS STRONG AND WELL PRODUCED.CHRIS YOU ARE ONLY GOING TO GET BETTER AND CHOOSE YOUR MATERIAL CAREFULLY.I LISTENED TO THIS CD WITH A SMILE ON MY FACE,YOU GOT IT!!!!"
5,Great CD,"I actually bought it for my wife, but have listened to it and let me tell you, Daughtry rocks. Great CD"
2,Skip it,This CD is not by far as good as I thought it would be. Nearly every song sounds the same. Do yourself a favor and save some money and just buy individual songs.
3,Decent,"This cd is decent for what it is, the songs are catchy. But I'm sure 5 years ago Daughtry never thought he'd be making music for soccer moms who skip over an entire song because of one swear in the middle of it. There are some songs well constructed, but when I saw him on American Idol a few times, I honestly didn't think he would go so soft. Its sad a lot of you probably don't even know who Slash is. I like that one. Check out Velvet Revolver's first album if you want some real modern rock. You want something a little heavier, intelligent lyrics, but not too extreme check out Megadeth's ""United Abominations!!""By the way, Nickelback sucks. All their songs sound the same. Their not rock stars, they're pop stars, same as Daughtry now unfortunately."
5,Best Rock Album in YEARS!!!,"Okay, so anyone who is a true rocker probably thinks American Idol is a bunch of hype. But beyond the veil of commercialism, the franchise has turned out something of value here. Now, remember: Chris Daughtry turned FUEL down to be their next lead singer, so that he could front his own band. Good career move! EVERY song on the CD rocks, and once I put it into my player, it was the only disc I listened to for three months. My suggestion...BUY IT!!! Also, if you can find the Wal*Mart limited edition with ""Home"" and ""Crashed"" acoustic as two bonus tracks even better. Great album! Waiting for the next one..."
3,Not bad for a debut album,"The Cd is good but not great. I expected more good songs after hearing ""It's Not Over"", but it turned out to be far the best song on the album. Other good songs are ""Breakdown"", ""Gone"", ""What About Now"", ""Over You"". I love Chris's voice. One of the best voices in modern rock music. But I wish there were more good songs. This Cd is very good to listen in a car when driving. Even the songs I don't really like sound Ok then. But I really hope there'll be more good songs on Daughtry's next Cd."
4,A good buy!,"This is a very nice buy for any fan of Chris Daughtry and the ""Daughtry"" band.I did have a problem getting my CD to be read in my laptop, for some reason, but it played just fine in a CD player and in another computer.I enjoyed the DVD and it's features and am a fan, of course, of the songs! I'd recommend this as a purchase."
4,hey come on -- it's CHRIS!,"I usually don't go for ""rocker"" music but I think this has some songs that aren' too hard rock and honestly I would listen to him sing the phone book just to hear his voice!"
3,Rock and ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!,"Heh. Not really.Sure, it's safe. Sure, it's corporate. But so were Boston, Journey and ELO, and I like those bands. This guy had a style and stuck with it. Post-grunge is about as dead as disco now (with the exception of Hinder; where DID they come from?!), but it's nice to hear something like this on the radio every once in a while. Seems like all I hear lately is rap/R&B.; It's refreshing to hear anything on Top 40 radio with real instruments, at least where I live. The age of nu-metal is looking pretty good these days by comparison. How pathetic we've become.I don't own this CD, nor will I ever. But I've heard the singles and it's nothing horrible. The lesser of many evils.Maybe he'll shock us all and do a prog rock album next."
1,Last Gasp for the Emo Rock Genre?,"Dull, predictable and over-wrought, this post American Idol runner-up is without originality or perspective. Chris's influences are so obvious, it begs the question, do we even need to hear him? He brings nothing new to the table, and has no musical depth beyond the very immediate emo rock genre. His sound is so `now', it's practically too late! He doesn't move forward, and he doesn't have enough depth in musical knowledge to make any sort of independent statement. It may be selling, but word to the wise Chris, save your money!"
5,Fantastic!,"This is a fantastic CD. Thankfully Daughtry didn't sell out and go ""pop"" on any of it. Do yourself a favor and JUST BUY IT!"
3,poor Chris,"I don't know if I had higher expectations for Chris, or if I was hoping that he would produce more of the ""rocker"" style music. It not as heavy metalish as he portrayed himself on American Idol. It's an OK Cd, not one of my favorites =("
2,They All Sound The Same,"i love Chris, but after listening to this CD (and my husband said the same thing), all the songs sound the same. It's hard to differentiate where one stops and the next one starts. I'd have loved to see ""Ring of Fire"" on this CD, but there are no ballads, no change of tempo... Simon would have said, ""Lacks imagination"". I know Chris can do better than this."
1,Silence critics? The ones I've read are howling -- with laughter,"I liked Daughtry at the start of the Idol season, but after a while everything started sounding the same -- like a Creed/Fuel/Nickleback knock-off. Exactly the same. Unfortunately, Daughtry's advisers couldn't get him to break out of that box here. Just as he has a tendancy on stage or stand in the same strange posture with the mic up high and his hands and mic obscuring his face, so he hasn't been able to change his stripes with the music itself. There's no originality here -- just a good voice doing a hackneyed imitation of a real rock star. To be a rock star you have to be a great performer on stage, you have to have a memorable personality and you need to have something original to offer. Daughtry fails on all three counts."
2,Nickelback? Creed? 3 Doors Down? Oh.. It's Chris Daughtry? Really? Hmm...,"That's how generic his music is. There's no rawness, there's no emotion. Just plain, basic, sweet, over and over again.Even the lyrics are full of sugar. Nothing that could make you stop for a while, and think, and then go back and listen. I thought he loves Ed Kowalczyk of Live, no?However, I have no doubt that he will sell millions of copies. He'd better be quick before another Idol ""rocker"" coming out of this year's season!"
2,I didn't know Chris loved Nickleback this much,"The CD sounds good, it has a catchy feel to it, but it sounds EXACTLY LIKE NICKLEBACK. Don't get me wrong, I own all things by them, but really, I was hoping for something heavier and more original."
4,Probably the Best American Idol Rock Album Yet,"Okay, maybe it's the only true rock album to come out of American Idol, but it is very good. Much better than the `pop' album that Bo Bice was obviously forced to make. It definitely holds its own with the other rock albums of its genre, such as Live, etc. After listening to it several times I have come to the conclusion that there may not be any mega-hits on it, but every single song holds merit. There is not a bad song on the album. Definitely a good one to pop in the cd player on a long drive."
5,Most perfect CD EVER.,"The CD is amazing. I can't pick a favorite, 'cause all the songs sound perfect. Chris is an amazing singer and songwriter, he's a complete musician, and the CD reflects it. Every single song just ROCK, as DAUGHTRY do.Buy one :)"
4,Great Surprise,"I didn't know what to expect when I bought this CD. I don't watch American Idol so when I bought it I didn't know he had been on the show. I just wanted the song ""Home"" by the random voice on the radio. I was pleasantly surprised by the songs I got and the voice I heard. I would recommend this CD to anyone!"
5,Best Rock Cd of the Year,"I've been waiting for this cd to come out and I am glad he decided to do it his own way and start fresh, rather than go to Fuel. I LOVE this cd and I can't get enough of it. He has passion in his lyrics, soul and voice that is very rare today. I like every song but one. The best song (for me) is Breakdown. Some of the songs make you feel angry but it's also cathartic. I strongly suggest this cd to anyone that likes good ol' rock. You will no longer just think of him as an ""american idol"" contenstant that didn't win. Hears to you Chris in making a wonderful cd for us music lovers! You will be around for a long time!"
5,Daughtry CD,"After continually hearing Daughtry on the radio at work, and liking the songs that I heard, I decided to purchase the CD. VERY wise choice on my part. The CD is great! It's been in my CD player since it arrived about a month ago, and it won't be coming out anytime soon."
5,As Good As American Idol Gets ...,"Chris Daughtry is what American Idol is and should be about: Outstanding undiscovered talent. To think he was a service manager at Crown Honda in Greensboro here in NC 3 or 4 years ago. Every track on this album is good: Something that is a rare find in a debut album. And it is not a retread of other peoples hits as some other NC American Idol performers have chosen to do. Congratulations, Chris. You deserve it."
5,Nothing like I expected,"I normally don't buy too many CDs because most of the time I usually like maybe one or two songs, and the rest are not that great. But there is the exception of this particular recording artist. Wonderful music! I love every song on this CD. You will not be disappointed. Looking forward to more work from Daughtry."
5,Daughtry Rocks!!,This is an awesome album!! I think it is an outstanding first effort by Chris Daughtry.
5,words can describe,Totally worth shipping this all the way to Cape Town South Africa...this cd is mind blowing....exactly what i expected from Chris....
5,Love it! Chris is amazing!,"I have to admit, I voted for Taylor last season..but Chris' album..has my vote this season! ;) Chris is amazing! I will buy any cd he puts out! I love it!"
4,Rocket Launcher,"As Daughtry's second set is nearing release, I thought I'd join the many reviews that have focused on this strong freshman set. Three tracks are my favorite on the disc. The opener, ""It's Not Over,"" is a haunting pop/rock track with some potent guitar that blooms in thunder, ""My life with you means everything, so I won't give up that easily; I'll blow it away ... Can't we make this something good?"" ""What I Want"" blasts the rafters and is a great hard rock track with Chris' great vocals belting emotion. ""There & Back Again"" knocks back the rocket launcher guitar and ignites. Other tracks on the CD like ""Crash"" are strong. This is a great pop/rock set that is sure to knock the rust out of your Buick. Enjoy!"
4,Good CD,"Well done for a debut CD. There are many things he can improve on, but altogether this is a pretty good compilation of songs."
4,American Idol,"I was very impressed with this album. I have purchased three of the American Idol's albums, Chris, Elliot, and Carrie, Carrie's was the best so far, but Daughtry held his own. I was not too impressed by Elliot."
2,all the same,"OK, so I'm an ancient 60s refugee. I sound like my own parents did, decades ago -- but -- all of this music (and not just Daughtry) sounds the same to me.More specifically, I think this CD is a good example of how too much loud electric ""background"" overwhelms the singing and the melody of most pop today. Turn it down and let me hear the singer!!! I like Daughtry's singing, but I can hardly hear it under all that twangy noise."
2,Whatever.......,Nickleback and Creed called and they want their songs and sound back.Good Cd but sounds like too many other bands out right now.
2,Didn't blow me away.,"A couple months ago I read an interview with Chris Daughtry, and he said his album would be so hard-core rock that only a couple songs could be played on the radio. Give me a break! The only thing that makes this album different from a Backstreet Boys CD is Chris' unique voice. However, his voice on the CD shows no range. Every song has the same sound with the same vocals. I liked him better on American Idol."
3,Bought it for my girlfriend,"It's a pretty good album in my opinion. Sounds like the contemporary 'pop rock' style music you hear on any new rock station. Gotta love that dude's hairstyle (or lack thereof). My girlfriend LOVES the album, so that's why I bought it for her. I'm a 'good catch'."
5,dauthry,I think chris should have won american idol. His singing was so original along with his style. Ilove his cd and would support it all the way
3,No bad but no great.,"I have listened to album at least a dozen times now. This album isn't bad, but it is by no means great. I did watch Idol and really liked Chris. After hearing samples I bought the album. This album has a sound that is already out there. The album sounds more manufactured than inspired. There is nothing new here or anything to get excited about. All and all nothing special. I expected much more."
5,Daughtry,"Awesome CD!! I love it. There are a few tracks that are a little more hard rock, but overall the CD is very good!!"
2,yawn,"i like the guy, but this stuff is ultra-boring. thats okay though, teenage girls will make the guy millions."
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting more from Daughtry. If his next album isnt stepped up a notch, there wont be a third. Im not so sure he will make in this industry aftering hear this debut album."
1,Postage,"Once again, this customer asked for and paid for 2 day delivery and Amazon and the seller responded with 14 day delivery. Not satisfactory."
5,This is what it's all about,"I can't stress enough how amazing this guy's voice is.There's a difference between a performer and a real musician and Daughtry is certainly the latter. His voice is better than most of the past seasons winners: the strength, passion and emotion flies through his voice and right into you where you can't escape as much as you try. His is a voice that continues to grow and mature into something that can never be boring, repetitive or old. You want to hear where he goes and how he does and i guarantee, the destination will end up thrilling you more than the journey !Highly recommended, keep your eyes on this guy =)"
3,Sizes Are Limited,"I Could Not Find My Size, There Were Only 2 Choices For The Size. They Were Not My Size."
5,Best new band in a long time,"This is my first ever Amazon review-I heard Moses Mayfield open for Pete Yorn recently and I was instantly hooked. I ordered this cd immediately and it is in constant rotation over here. This is the best new band I've heard in a while. I like the entire cd, but my faves are Control, Strange New Place, A Cycle, Element, and Modern Rarity."
5,Great Thanks!,Would definitely buy from this seller again. Came very quickly and in condition that was stated. Thanks!
3,"Works alright, but not the best results or quality","I used this product to make my blonde hair a little more golden. It did make a slight difference, but not as much as I've experienced with other neutral hennas. It also did not mix smoothly and was very grainy, even when mixed with bubbling, boiling water. That being said, it's very affordable, so you get what you pay for."
5,Covers the gray,"I use a box of the Hennaluscent Neutral and mix it with 1/2 box of Colora Henna Red Sunset to cover my gray hairs. I used to use hennaluscent Sunset Glo, but they have discontinued selling it for some reason????? I am a natural redhead and this seems to do the trick fof the gray hairs so far. It is inexpensive, does not damage my hair and it looks great!"
5,Great as a treatment for Damaged Hair,"This works great to fill in damaged and bleached hair, this along with aphogee treatment can repair hair even close to breaking off !"
