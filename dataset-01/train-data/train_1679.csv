5,Excellent,"This goes perfectly with the towel bar, and it looks really nice in my half bath. The chrome looks elegant and matches the waterfall faucet well."
2,Danze Toilet Paper Holder,"Looks nice, easy to put on toilet paper, but toilet paper falls off easily when pulling down/off toilet paper.Danze D446232 Parma Toilet Paper Holder, Chrome"
5,Amazing!!!,Great price and fast delivery. Awesome sound. I am hearing sounds in music that I have never heard before. Buy these speakers and throw in 'Dark Side of the Moon' and listen to what you have been missing.
4,not bad at all,"If you can get this on sale cheap then go for it because they are awesome, but in all honesty if you can afford to spend a little more then I highly recommend the Rti10's instead. You will be getting more for the money with the 10's than these.Although I did own these at once and enjoyed them big time. They sound great but are a little bulky considering theres no woofers. I had to dock one star because of that fact, such a tall tower speaker and no woofers, only a pair of mids and a tweeter. Seemed kinda useless to have such a large cabinet for so little, like I said before you will be getting more for youre money if you go with the Rti10's."
5,"True then, still true now!","Although this book was written in the middle 1990s, the information is just as accurate today as it was then. Network marketing is on the move. In fact, since the stock market bubble burst, more people are coming back into network marketing than ever before.This book make a great tool to build your belief in this industry. Great prospecting tool as well. If your prospects read this book and still have no interest, then they are not prospects.I also recommend Who Stole The American Dream and Wave 4."
5,Very Inspirational!!! Easy to Read.,I cannot say enough great things about this book. It is great for motivation in personal as well as professional life. I plan to read it again and again!!! I highly recommend this book to EVERYONE.
5,Awesome spagetti sauce,We received this sauce as part of a gift pack from my mother for Christmas a couple of years ago. Since then we have tried to find it as it is awesome.
4,"Offenbach - La Belle Hélène / Lott, Beuron, Sénéchal, Naouri, Le Roux, Todorovitch, Les Musiciens du Louvre, Minkowski","Offenbach - La Belle Hélène / Lott, Beuron, Sénéchal, Naouri, Le Roux, Todorovitch, Les Musiciens du Louvre, Minkowski is a 2001 EMI Records recording starring Choer des Musiciens du Louvre under direction of Marc Minkowski. The sound quality is somewhat muted and not as good as one can expect from a recording from 2001. Music notes, all the lyrics and photographs of the performers are contained in the booklet. A quite good recording that is somehow mishandled due to the less then stellar sound quality. Recommended. 4/5."
1,SPOILER ALERT ANYONE?!?,"I HATE when WWE puts the winner(s)of title matches on the covers of ppv DVDs. I don't follow the TV shows and can't afford the ppvs ($50?) so DVD is the way I keep up with WWE, sure it's a month delay but without prior knowledge the shows are just as exciting as watching them live. But this Fatal Four Way cover and the Survivor Series 2008 cover RUIN everything! I won't bother buying this, I already know who won 3 of the 7 matches."
1,This is fake.,"If anyone saw the fatal 4 way poster with randy on it, thats the cover. The dvd is always the same as the ppv poster art. Someone just made this up."
1,don't waste your time...,I did not get what I ordered and the company still has not contacted me....
5,Very pretty color!,"These are a perfect peach pink color! Not too dark, but soft, pale and creamy pink. The size is not too big, either. The button shape helps to make it look more subtle, not sticking out of the ears. They are not PERFECTLY shaped, though, one button shape looks more flat than the other, but since I didn't pay any money for these, I am not complaining. I received them as a free promotional gift from Dahlia. The shipping package was in a plain business envelope with the earrings wrapped in plastic bubble.Overall, these are very nice earrings!"
4,Dance review,"Setrak vol 10 is good to work with for dancing. The first track makes a great entrance piece. The tracks are short, so you can show a lot of variety!"
4,Works well,"This device provides a reasonable method for digitizing your slides. Once you've locked in the focus and exposure, you can process a stack of slides very effectively.I do think the slide holder could be improved to limit movement. Some movement can occur when putting bulky slides into the holder. You have to be careful not to cause slippage that changes the field of view.Combined with Canon's PC software, you can review the slide on your computer screen and take the shot remotely."
5,EXCELLENT PURCHASE!,"I received this slide copier in perfect conditions and with all possible adapters for my camera. The only drawback was that they send the 58 mm S2/S3 converter and not the 52 mm one, that would save them -at least- one converter, as the copier is 52 mm.Otherwise, an excellent experience!Thumbs up for 47th Street Photo!!!"
4,"After figuring it out, its great.","Received all parts as described. Metal construction. I think you need above average tech skills to figure out how it all goes together and then how to photograph the negatives and finally how to use Photography software to invert to color. I used Photoshop to ""Invert"" and then Auto Color/Tone to get it right. The color looks much better than when I used my HP Photosmart negative scanner. I'd recommend this product."
1,Piece of Plastic - Should be no stars - has one because Amazon required it,"This product was a VERY BIG DIAPPOINTMnet. For a listing price of almost $100 I expected it to come with a built in, adjustable light source that could be controled. It did not. It is just a grooved black plastic tube with a plastic silde holder (that sticks) and a cheap opaque light filter. Total worth maybe $12.95."
5,Great Poems with Simple Language,"Orhan Veli is among the greatest poets of the Turkish literature on a par with Nazim Hikmet and Melih Cevdet. It is rare that the true feeling of a poem remains after undergoing even the most professional translation. Besides, the skill is in meaning the most with the simplest words possible. The simplicity of his language makes his poems as genuine and majestic as it is in its native language."
5,you will be amazed,"This book is a well-written, engaging resource on flower reproduction, a subject not often taught in depth. I used this book as the main resource for a lecture about flower color given to high school students. THey were fascinated. Biology and chemistry teachers alike should read this book. Its pictures are colorful and interesting (eg an orchid species that evolved to appear exactly like a bee)."
4,sargant's least best,"This cd is ok,but does'nt compare to the other 2 which rock moreespecially ""if you want more"".I rather listen to this than the stuff theyplay on the radio."
3,poor Lana can't even save this one...,"The good times for Lana Turner at MGM were well and truly over when she was assigned to star in a minor ""masterpiece"" entitled MR. IMPERIUM. It's not so surprisingly one of the lesser titles in Lana Turner's resume. Not even her beauty and charm can save this lumbering turkey of a musical.Turner plays Fredda Barlo, an American cabaret star who becomes romanced by a down-to-earth member of European royalty--known simply as Mr. Imperium (and played by talented opera basso Ezio Pinza). Featured in thankless supporting roles are Debbie Reynolds and Marjorie Main.Fans of musicals are likely to enjoy it (despite a song about ""presto anti-pasto""--what the...?). There's a reason why this movie is now in Public Domain."
5,great fun,"My 3 and 5 year old boys both LOVE this book. We have read it over and over. It is great fun. A few rhymes I knew before, but I learned lots of new ones. This is a book you won't get tired of reading to your kids."
5,Review,Great product. Received in good condition as advertised. Actually better than I expected. I will continue to use this site for purchasing my textbooks.
2,Shorts my keyboard,"This is an entertaining product but it does have an effect on your electronics. I placed mine near my backlight keyboard. For some reason it would cause the keys to go dark every time I switched it on. Suffice to say I moved it from there and no problem, but you have got to wonder- if it affects a keyboard that way what else is it affecting?"
4,Interesting light,"It is a cool light. Got it for my son as a gift. Works well as a night light and is interesting to watch. The sound recognition seems ""slow to warm up"" but does work after it has been on for awhile. It is somewhat heavy and has a glass plate front, so would need good placement for younger kids."
2,Not too happy with this one,"I was so excited to find this - I thought my son will love this! He has CP and a visual impairment... loves light up toys! This is GLASS, not plastic. I think I might have missed that in the description... And it's smaller than I thought. I could have lived with the size, but not the material. I can't really allow him to play much with it, since it's glass."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,THE LIGHT WAS BETTER THAN I EXPECTED. HAD BATTERY CONVERTER INCLUDED AT NO EXTRACT CHARGE. LIGHT WAS CLEAR AND VERY BRIGHT.
3,You get what you pay for.,"Works good, when it works. It takes 5-60 seconds to turn on. Given the cost, its worth the price. Enjoy your mini Borg disk!"
5,A Lesson Well Learned,"From the very beginnig you are pushed head first into the lives of Carlie, her abusive boyfriend Devon, and her domineering father Ricky. The story was told with amazing detail and made me feel like I was right there on the scene. My heart went out to Carlie to a certain degree because when a man has you dickmatized you'll take alost anything. I was happy that she had someone in her life (her grandmother) to balance her out, and provide a safe haven for he when she needed it. I cried real tears when she opened the gift her grandmother gave her. Carlie's story was reminiscent of so many woman, and I think this book would be an excellent gift for anyone going through this very same situation. Sometimes you make it out alive, and sometimes you don't. But one things is always certain...whether it is your spirit or your body, you will almost always walk away bruised."
3,What do we do?,From the 1st page to the last page I was involved. I enjoyed the familiar landmarks...it was easy to have the mental pictures. I have known someone similiar to every character in the book. It's a shame these things have to happen all to often to young people in this metropolitan area we live in. The truth is in this book.
3,Bruised by Azarel,This book was not recommended to me by anyone but it just drew my attention because of the theme of brutality and self esteem which is a big problem for young girls who are attracted to bad boys who mistreat them and then turn around and try to buy them things just to do it all over again. Nevertheless this was my first time reading anything by this author and even though the title speaks for itself it draws attention to a big problem facing younger women who are in abusive relationships.
1,Am I Alone???,"In thinking that this book is a hot mess!!!! I mean, the premise of the book is admirable. Domestic violence and how women escape and/or cope is always interesting... but this book is written like, uh, for a third grader! I'm almost finished, but I want to know where is Carlie's mother? Why is she never explained? A lot of the descriptions are corny. I could go on and on... like why are there gaps in the story? Carlie was in the hospital one minute and then the next minute she was on her way to New York with Devon. Wasn't she bruised up with scars, stitches, broken bones and stuff?? I mean her grandma was upset by her condition when Carlie was in the hospital...but suddenly she's well enough to go on a road trip with her man who put her in the hospital? Okay, now I'm rambling like the book... this is why I buy Urban tales from Half Price Books."
2,So Spacey,I picked up this book because I was told it was a very good read. Now I will give the author credit for the story line. It concept of the story was very well thought out but the characters were very undeveloped. Their personalities seem'd so unreal..Carlie??? I don't know I just didn't like the book that much and the gaps were crazy in the book. The transition from one scene to the next was crazy...Sometimes in the book I turned a page back to figure out if I skipped a page or not. Like I said overall the book had a great concept but it wasn't executed correclty.
4,Abusive,"The concept was good.The book showed how Carlie, a young woman who most would think had everything dealt with domestic abuse from her boyfriend Devon.After Devon would abuse Carlie he would lie and say that he wouldn't do it again. Buy her a gift and everything is all right. Until the next time, if there is one.Carlie lacked self esteem and Devon didn't know how to deal with his demons. I hope the book helps women and men learn from both Carlie and Devon."
4,Mental/Physical Abuse,"Can I say I understand it, why do women stay or go back---NO. i was not left on this earth to judge. Carlie was a nice girl with no common sense, that is how I see it. she had a good supporting family behind her but the love she had for Devon was something I couldn't understand not while being abused like that. hope in part 2 she sees the light. Very interesting read."
2,Lost In Translation,"The premise of this book is admirable, but the execution was just horrible. The first chapter had me hooked, but by chapter 3 I was like what the heck is going on here. There are way too many gaps in this book. I wish Azarel would of given more details with the characters of the book. I wanted to know what happened to Carlie's mom. I wanted to know what happened to Devon as a kid after the situation with his sister (don't want to give it away if you haven't read the book yet). After reading this book you are left to assume what happened instead of knowing for certain what happened."
2,I BRUISED MY EYES READING THIS BOOK,IF YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT READING THIS PLEASE DONT IT WILL MAKE YOU MAD POOR CARLIE
5,Excellent resource,I went to college in Nashville and took a publishing class. This book was more practical than the entire semester!
4,A few cool tips,"Has some insight about how to get put on, but not much more than I already knew about."
4,Good,"Music producers and musicians know all too well the hardships of producing ad distributing good music and some of the agreed to share their experiences with novices to improve their chances of success. This book is a simple but effective guide to the music world, a good book but it doesn't come close to Ty Cohen's ""How To Make A Fortune In The Music Industry By Doing It Yourself: Your Personal Step-By-Step Guide To Having A Successful Career In The Music Business. ... To Sell Music, Book Shows And Get Noticed!"" ,a book that contains all of the above plus information never revealed in another title before."
4,Music Publishing,"Very helpful and funny with it's insights, but never losing it's purpose of giving the reader all the information they need to look for the things they need to know.Entertaining and a must read!"
2,Poor Sound,the sound quality is poor and background noise level high. Kenny Davern's contribution is as a sideman not a headliner as the title implies.
4,untitled,"Although the sound quality is poor in parts , and the band sound as though the bar bill will be higher than the gig pays ( yet again ) this 1974 live recording is a great set for fans of Fairpot or Sandy Denny.It is wonderful to hear Sandy get inside the tunes and weave some magic moments. The boys in the band are really getting away with the tunes by this time and as much as I hate to single anyone out Jerry Donahue really is brilliant on these discs.an underated player in a very underated band.Fairport where no slick roadshow of studied proffesionalism, and as with many great live bands it is the slightly sour moments that elevate the sweet to real heights.Enjoy."
3,Couldn't eat it,Shipping was fast. The texture is great but the flavor tastes like soap. It was inedible and threw it out. I assume chocolate or vanilla might taste better.
2,disapointing!,i was looking forward o trying this product...but it tasted really chemical and plastic...very disappointing!
5,Another step forward for Louisville Football,Great book and a must have for any fan of Louisville Athletics and fans of NCAA football. Gives great insight in the difficulties the program has gone through and the amazing strides it makes yearly.
2,"""Singing in the rain"" it isn't. Grossly overrated.","If you can't do remake of ""Singing in the rain"" do a rip-off. However, shoes to fill are too big. It does get 2 stars for trying.Several scenes are directly lifted from ""Singing in the rain"". Even though Gene Kelly is mentioned once in extra materials ""Singing in the rain"" never is.Acting by Jean Dujardin is often cringe-inducing. Bérénice Bejo is better. James Cromwell is always good.I just didn't care about any of the characters except for the dog."
3,"Good, but not great",More of a novelty movie than anything else. The extra features were far more interesting than the movie itself and worth the price of the product alone.
3,Does not live up to Best Picture worthiness.,Likeable enough film. Has its charm. Just not best picture material. Not even worthy of a best picture nomination. Worth a rental. Period.
2,Artist,I was relly dissappointed with this movie. We had company over and they did not enjoy it either Not impressed
1,the Artist UltraViolet Digital Copy,I was unable to play DVD in Australia due to the UltraViolet Digital Copy!!!! Can anyone help to make it clearer when purchasing DVD from the States
2,Huh?,"After watching this Academy award winner, the four of us looked at each other with a group ""huh."" We unanimously felt there had to be more to it. The gimmick of the silent and black and white film wore thin real quick, and was done much more humorously in Mel Brooks ""Silent Movie."" That movie was funny! ""Singing in the Rain"" dealt with the transition period from the silent-to-talkies with far greater skill (music, dancing, humour etc.....) The dog in the Artist was truly the highlight of the film....Must have been a real slow year for films....."
2,I just don't get it,"I'm still trying to figure out why THE ARTIST swept the Oscars. I feel that so many of the people who loved it haven't seen a ""real"" silent movie. I find it sad that this movie won for Best Picture, when the best film about movies is SINGING IN THE RAIN, and it did not recieve a nomination for picture sixty years ago. I certainly think HUGO was the movie of the year to see if you want to see a homage to cinema history. It was magical and a joy to behold."
5,"If a movie makes you laugh and cry,","you probably are watching a master work of art. Much has been written about the performances of Dujardin and the rest of the cast. Suffice to say that it is a fenomenal movie experience and a wonderful homage to the silent movie era. Besides that, an incredible tour the force of director Hazanavicius. Buy it, watch it, cry, laugh and wonder."
3,the Artist,"very unusual and in BxW - Dog was the star and again a simple story line andI wasn't too excited about it all, but had to see it once because he won Oscars all over the place."
3,Snoozer,"Although it was visually attractive, it did not hold my interest. The music kept making me doze off and I could never get into the plot."
3,A little underwhelming after all the hype,It was interesting to watch but after a while it was too much of the same and literally fell asleep and didn't finish it.
1,BEWARE: REGION LOCKED,"Beware: although advertised as 'all regions', this disc is, in, fact, locked & will only play on Region A players.It even states ""Regions A, B, C"" on the packaging, but it will not play on my Region B player, generating a ""region error"" message."
2,"I Agree with ""Just Don't Get It""","I, too, felt that this movie was overrated! As the other reviewer said, it was just an inferior imitation of ""Singin' in the Rain"" and if you want to see another silent movie that was just as good, and far more interesting, watch ""Silent Movie,"" Mel Brooks' ""homage"" to silent films. It had many of the same scenes as ""The Artist,"" had many more big stars, and had a wonderful scene in which Marcel Marceux (or however you spell it) delivered the only sound line in the movie. My best picture for this year was ""Midnight in Paris,"" although I also agree that ""Hugo"" was a wonderful film and a wonderful homage to old movies."
1,Ratio?,"I would of given this a higher score, but to have huge black bars on the right and left really pissed me off. It is bad enough when you get them on top and bottom, but to make a modern day movie in 1:33 ratio is just retarded. Also, no memory or bookmarks, so you have to start from the beginning every time you watch the movie."
5,Great Movie!,"I absolutely love this movie. It deserved every single award it won and then some. I honestly don't understand why HBO nor the other premium channels failed to show it (although I reserved mine before its release). Yes, it's a silent movie, but it is true, silents were never silent, and this modern one is proof of that."
5,Excellent FILM!,Read my full review here: [...]This is a tremendously charming film with great performance and a tremendous score. Watch it as soon as possible.
4,Trying to see beyond my Best Picture expectations,"I felt disappointed by this movie but only because of my expectations. If there were no such thing as the Academy Awards, if I had just picked up this movie and watched it with no expectations, I would have liked it, thinking it a well-produced, well-acted movie, and, more importantly, a refreshing departure from word-heavy, action-heavy modern fluff.I can see, too, why it won Best Picture. Oscars' voters eat up qualities like ""well-produced"" and ""well-acted"" and ""innovative while respecting tradition,"" and The Artist probably especially appealed to voters because of its many winks to film history.This is a nice, pretty-looking, nostalgic, popcorn movie. I was expecting it to be more. I was expecting it to do what great films do, which is to say something about what it means to be human, to show an intensified version of reality. But it would seem silly to be disappointed in a movie just because of my lofty, arbitrary expectations."
2,didn't do it for us,"From the looks of it, this is a very popular movie. In addition, it is supposed to contain the subtleties of French humor. So we were extremely disappointed by the whole experience: it is ridiculously melodramatic (a love story across the divide of success), everything is exaggerated to the point that it edges out all humor (the dog is the best character of all), and the plot is nothing but stereotype (a has-been struggles and gets a chance through the girl he once helped by chance). For the life of me, I can't see why anyone would think this is an artistic masterpiece.This is a complete bore, never hits a good emotional note, and not funny. Not recommended."
4,** zero extras **,"Loved ""The Artist"" in the theater -- saw it once, then took the family -- but if any movie called out for a DVD commentary or extras it was this one. Stunned that there is nothing, no background of the players, no chat by the art director or award winning composer, no image of the sources that were given homage, no extra pictures of (sigh) Berenice Bejo, no 1920's style short adventure of the hero dog a la Roger Rabbit, blah blah blah.----------------------------update of sorts: I saw a copy in my library that did indeed have a commentary track. At home I exposed my disk to tough questioning but still no extras."
5,A Walk Down Memory Lane,"I went to see this movie in theaters because I wanted to be able to say I saw a silent film in a theater. But it is so much more than that. The Artist is a love song to the glory days of Hollywood, a time we have never been able to recapture and never will. It is also a history lesson wrapped up in a lot of fun. The only other movie I know of that depicts the troubling and, for some, ruinous time of the birth of talkies in Singing in the Rain. However, the Artist takes it one step further and tells the story in the way it would have been told at the time. The aspect ratio, the cuts, the music, the directing, the scenes, and the silent aspect of the acting all come straight of the period and all are wondrously compiled into a compelling movie even for today's audiences. I predict that this film will be one that film students will be discussing for decades to come."
4,Classic cinema,"This film was unusual, to say the least. Since there is no audio the actors really had to ""act""......and they did. Don't want to see a series of black and white silent films but this one was well done."
3,Must watch and not listen,Arrived on time and was eager to watch. Must be committed and not involved in anything else. Would have enjoyed better in the theater.
4,Enjoyalbe,"A movie reminiscent of the early days in film. Actors did a good job imitating the silent film style and were able to portray the characters well. The plot line was predictable, but it was engaging to watch. An leading actor looses his career when talkies begin filming while an actress he helped becomes a star. She remembers his kindness and repays it. The dog stole many of the scenes. It is a film that everyone but the very young ( who like a lot of color, action and animation) can watch and enjoy."
5,LOVE!!!,One of the most beautiful and brilliant films I've ever seen. It's a keeper that I could watch over and over.
3,the artist,"was a strange little movie.,but I have heard that there were many silent scren actors that couldnt make it in film after there was sound because of their voices?dont know if its true?I got this movie for my Dad"
3,It was OK,"I was expecting something mind blowing and instead viewed a very boring silent film. I thought that the film was going to show the transition from silent to movies with sound, but was wrong."
2,Very Disappointed,"I almost stopped watching after the first half hour. It seemed that nothing was happening in the story and the music was starting to grate on my nerves. But since I already paid for it, I kept watching. Unfortunately it didn't get any more interesting. I was not impressed. Usually an Academy Award Winner is a good show; this one, not so much.I was aware this film was silent before I rented it, but I didn't know that it wasn't widescreen. If I had known that, I wouldn't have bothered renting the HD version."
2,This won the Oscar for best movie? Why?,"The Artist is a seriously disappointing movie and I do not understand how it won even one Oscar. A silent movie star is eclipsed by the advent of talking films and sinks into a drunken slovenly depression and is finally rescued by another star, a woman whose career he helped to launch. That's it. There are no subplots, nothing else, no surprises, no messing with our minds, no dark corners where we might not want to be taken. The story line is flat and linear and just boring. Who cares if the cinematography is excellent? This is a lazy film."
2,Meh!,"I guess it didn't stink on ice. But no one apparently ever sat down and worked out what the film was supposed to be. If it was supposed to be an exercise in making a new silent film in the old style, it just didn't happen. And who would care, anyway, outside of a film class assignment.If it was supposed to be a new form of silent film, at least it wasn't the classic style. But again, who cares? It wasn't any kind of new story. Tiresome.If it was supposed to be a film about the silent film era, it was seriously marred by the inept attempt to emulate the old silent genre.Yes, it won Oscars. But note that you can win Oscars any day with a halfway competent film about the film industry. SAG people are such narcissists.So, meh! You'll probably want to see it, just because... But don't expect much."
4,Nicely done!,Great depiction of a silent movie based on life. Great use of make-up and costumes. The dog should have been nominated for a special academy award.
4,Impressive,This movie has many interesting and delightful qualities...those who love film will like it just for the history....it has some great scenes. Maybe slightly too long. Possibly could have used more editing.
5,Shhhh Quiet ...,Silent or not ... this is a fun movie to watch. It was so well done that it's not hard to see why it won so many awards. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up. Movie making at it's finest ... Highly recommended!
3,Not outstanding on small screen,"My wife and I were a bit disappointed in the film. Although the acting was superb, the story seemed to drag at several points and did not keep my attention."
4,A Novel Treasure,"The Artist is a unique rarity which must be experienced by all major fans of film. It truly is a marvel to have the ability to tell such a delicate story without the use of sound, but through pure visual representation."
4,I liked it...,"I can see why many may not like the movie...after all it is black and white and mostly silent (except for the music)and to be honest it was hard for me to watch it in one sitting especially the first 20 mintues or so but later on I got hooked. Seriously, the first few minutes I was like: ""Is the whole movie going to be like this?."" I came here to check out the reviews and I saw all the 5 star ratings and then I found out that it actually won several Oscars. I then thought that I might as well stick it out and see if it had any redeeming value. I'm glad I did...It's not a fast paced, action ridden movie but in the end I found it to be enjoyable. It's not the kind of movie one might want to watch with buddies while drinking beers and expecting to be entertained right from the beginning of the movie but you might enjoy while watching it alone, with one or a few friends and/or your significant other"
3,What I like or dislike,The captions often didn't stay on the screen long enough.The story line was pretty common.The Dog was the best part!
3,Why Did This Picture Win Academy Awards?,"Yes, there have not been many recent general release, major motion pictures shot in black and white lately but the story seemed like a luke warm remake of ""A Star is Born."" I do not believe it lives up to all the acclaim it has received and was rather disappointed."
2,Not worth any of the Oscars it won.,"I just finished seeing this movie and I can only say one thing about it. What was all the hoopla about it? At best it was passable, and at worst it was confusing and boring. The lead actors were alright, but that was about it. I can't really say anything good about this film. But I can say don't rent it and DEFINITELY don't buy it."
2,Way overrated...,"This movie slogs along on some tried & true Hollywood tropes & lots of long slow stretches of treacly sentimentality. The ""hero"" is supposed to represent an icon from the classic period of silent film but from the few movies you see him performing in it's hard to tell if he's supposed to be Fairbanks, Chaplin or Valentino. I think The Artist would have worked better if the Artist had been portrayed as a consistent character with backbone & spunk, but ultimately he's just a cartoon Norman Maine, from A Star is Born, wallowing in self-pity.Harold Lloyd made many films in a similar vein but every scene was filled with inventiveness & humor as well as pathos.The dog should have received the Oscar."
1,Unkown,"I am unable to review The Artist, as the copy I received could not be played in Australia (wrong region)"
1,Ridiculous,Couldn't wait for this film to get over. It was a boring movie trying to bring some kind of artistic value by making it in black and white.
4,Drawing Down,"Funk engages Biblical images of women and contemporary images of religion in this slim but engaging book of poetry. The first section, ""Darkness Like Dresses,"" writes from the point of view of several Biblical or Biblically suggested women such as Eve, Goliath's wife, and Mary Magdalene. The second section, ""An Alphabet of Psalms,"" runs across the author's engagement with life in all of its gritty manifestations: first kisses, infertility, and the significance of a man's shoes. The last sections deal with the difficulty of language and religion.Funk both deftly displays a grasp of vivid concrete imagery and a lack of fear about the difficult themes of life, including sexuality and religion. If you want to be challenged by a new poetic glimpse into women's lives, Head Full of Sun may fit the bill."
2,A Bloody 2.5,"Ex-Poison Clan member, JT Money, drops a painful Blood Sweat And Years. JT Money starts off with the title track's intro to prepare you for what you think may be a good release, but turns out to be a teaser. He gets right to ""War"" over a crunkified Cool & Dre production. It continues over to ""Hi-Lo"" with a more bounce affect. C. Tricky Stewart brings the average lyricism of JT out on ""Where My Thugs At"" featuring Lo. The most impressive with a different twist with positivity and direction on teaching his son on ""Father To Son"". ""Spanish Climax (Interlude)"" has a distinctive beat that should have been used to uplift hopes. The features and good production didn't seem to revive this album without bleeding to death on this Miami emcee/rapper."
5,call it a comeback!,"after buying his last album ""Pimpin On Wax"" and only liking about 5 songs, i wasn't even gonna get this new album. but i'm very glad i did, cuz i love it! the beats on this album are BLAZIN! and JT comes tight on every track! my fav songs are:""War"", ""Hi-Lo"", ""What Y'all N***az Want"", ""I Like The Way"", ""N***az Better Run"""
2,the first is always better,The album is toooooooooooooooooo pop and i just could not get in to it but i can see how others would like it
3,I know Ive been changed.,"I really enjoyed one song on the cd, ""I know Ive been changed"", hence the reason for purchasing. I am not really a Lashun Pace-Rhodes fan and was not thrilled by the songs on the cd."
4,"Good, but not as good as the original.","I bought this particular compact disc after hearing the initial one (Innovators) from a free computer compact disc package many years ago. The original one is sublime new-age and very original. I expected the music on this compact disc to be in a similar vein, and the style is in many ways similar, but it just isn't quite as good as the original. Despite that, I still think it is a good purchase, and it is good music to read to, relax to or drive to. The original disk I also bought with the extra two tracks, and much of the music on that is spine chillingly inspirational and meditative. I guess it is very difficult for the composers to produce more music better than the first one."
3,Does not fit a 1990 Honda Accord DX,"I purchased this started because the Amazon Parts Compatibility Check said it ""Will Fit Your Car!"" It is a different model number from the one that is in my car so I was a bit skeptical. So I checked the Bosch web site as well and it confirmed Amazon's Parts Compatibility Check, and said that it would fit. So since it was about $50 cheaper than the one that was in the car, I ordered it. It doesn't fit. So if you have a 1990 Accord do not purchase this. You want the Bosch SR1286X Starter."
2,"Very Boring, Very Repetitive","I had bought this book, hoping to be able to use it to study for a human rights exam. This book is not only extremely difficult and boring to read, but it is very repetitive. There are many superfluous words and sentences, about how well certain human rights organs are doing, but no detail as to how they are making progress. Very little substance, too many unnecessary words. The book could be easily half of its length and I have had to purchase another book as I am certain this one is inadequate. It is also extremely over priced for what it has to offer."
3,Get Busy on the Dance floor,This I believe was a number on kit by Sean paul but it is no where near as good as give me the Light was but it was not badLyrics 4/10 production 9/10 Overall 6.5/10 Good luck Sean
2,Relaxation & Meditation,"Most people who are serious about meditating yearn for a combination of sounds that harmonize with music. I like many types of sounds, rain, ocean waves, tranquil melodies.I am sorry, Hans Peter Neuber presents to many instrumental pieces. It is hard to meditate when once into a nice mood an electronic oboe or electronic piano comes blairing to the forefront. I wish Hans would have not put so many different instruments into the composition. It is a nice driving CD but is not conducive to meditating deeply.This CD needs more natural sounds and less electronic sounds."
5,Absolutly Great Stuff,"I love this stuff. smooth, long lasting, easy clean up. and it really goes a long way. i'm here to by my second 2.5oz bottle (took over a year to use my first) just thought i would stop and add my positive comments."
2,clip for s710a,"have this clip, bought it off ebay, phone wont stay in the holster at all, does not securely fit in to the phone at all. Lucky i got it for a penny so i didnt lose any money on this product, would recommend a leather case."
1,For cheap belts only!,"The S710a phone *does* fit in this holster, and it fits tight.However, the holster does *not* fit properly on the typical man's belt. In the course of the day, the holster will work itself loose from the belt, chewing up the fine leather finish of the belt as it goes. Leaving you with a ruined belt and a broken phone.Throw another item on Amazon's pile of returns."
3,"Good, but there's even better...","This is an excellent recording, but not all the tracks are the originals. I've enjoyed it as a replacement for my original LP but now have found the original on CD. It's Australian EMI 8297622. The original is even better because his approach is fresher - try to get it if you can."
2,not nearly as impressive in person,"I bought these earrings for my mother for Christmas. I was very dissappointed. The pearls are a milky white, not pinkish as they appear in the picture. They dangle a tad crooked. The pearls themselves are average at best. I do not recommend these earrings."
2,A disappointment,"If you are familiar with Woody Guthrie's performances of his own songs, listen to any of the available tracks here and compare Talley's well-intentioned work with Guthrie's -- or with performances by such singers as Pete Seeger. Sadly, Talley's performances are stunningly tuneless. I bought the CD because of a rave review in The New York Times. I now suspect that, unless the reviewer was tone-deaf, he had never heard Guthrie."
5,Reaches places I can't,I got this to use with my wife because it reaches places I can't. We've found it a great enhancement to our repertoire and she is thrilled. I highly recommend a gift like this when you're at a loss for that next birthday present.
3,"OK, but...","I really wanted to love this. And I won't throw it out, but it did not live up to my expectations. I found the lower level to be very quiet but the higher level vibe was significantly louder and not really as strong as I anticipated. It'll be used for foreplay rather than a ""go to, get it done"" type of vibe. It is made of hard slick plastic, rather than the smoother velvety/felted finish of some plastic toys. That's ok, but I didn't realize there is a seam up the entire side and around the tip, which is not at all easy to keep clean (found this out with first use and tinted lube). I think there must be better options for battery operated g-spot vibes, and there's always the no battery Pure Wand if cost isn't an issue."
1,Stay away,"I would have rated this zero if that had been an option.A number of criticisms:1) Even though entitled ""Great Battles of the Civil War"" it does not cover the great battles and it does not cover anywhere even close to the whole Civil War. It only covers 1865. What happened to 1861 - 1864??!! Misleading to say the least!!!2) After seeing ""Ulysses"" spelled ""Ulysees"" and then hearing the narrator tell me that First Manassas was in 1862 I had to stop.SAVE YOUR MONEY. Stick with Burns."
1,What happened to the 1st 3+ years.,"Evidently the producer thinks there were no great battles in the 1st 3+ years of the war. This is not history, don't buy it."
5,"Great, easy digestable book","An excellent read, for both football fans and others (note how simple my division of the world is...). For the former it is going to show them some aspects of the game they definetly did not know, whereas for the non-fans this book (being so reader friendly and not football technical)is maybe going to shed some light on why this sport means so much to so many people around the world.There is an esspecially interesting chapter on Iranian football history (yes, when i say football I do mean soccer).Other than making a few references to it, the author does not really say a lot about globalization."
3,"Easy read, keep your expectations low","First the picture on the cover caught my eye, when I was browsing the books in the ""social sciences"" section of my local bookstore. And then, not the title, but the sub-title made me pick this book up. In the book, Foer aims to lay down a ""theory"" for explaining the dynamics of globalization through ""World's most popular sport"". In each chapter, he picks up a case based on a team or a national league and tries to articulate on the politically or socially motivated relations between soccer and ""different forms of power"" (such as mob, money, national politics etc.) Well, I can't quiet say that he achieves his goal in this book. Despite its strong title and sub-title, content is very light weight and the book is an easy read on a 5-hour flight (not necessarily from Seattle to Atlanta :)) rather than a source for understanding the impact of globalization from a different angle. Bottom line, keep your expectations low and enjoy the accounts that Foer tells."
2,Promised so much ... delivered so little,"Those readers who gave this book 4 or 5 stars must not read many football books. Franklin's Foer's writing style is good and for that reason I give him two stars rather than one. His research was patchy and one-sided and he doesn't reveal any new information.I have to agree with all the other negative reviews of this book. Like so many teams full of superstars, it fell flat. I'd recommend anyone who was disappointed with it to get a copy of Simon Kuper's excellent book, ""Football against the Enemy,"" or ""The Miracle of Castel Di Sangro,"" by Joe McGinniss, which is a magnificent read."
3,Good book but with fillers,"Well, I'm a big football fan and I was very interested to read what an american scholar could write about the most beautiful game in the planet... His work is very well researched and actually shows a love for the game that is transmitted but I have to admit that I almost skipped two entire chapters (the ones about the Islam and Judaism) because it was obvious that they were just fillers to have the book with more pages and so it could be sold like a book.Maybe buy it used for half the price or rent it in a library, because the bad move of filling the book with boring (yawn) chapters makes this book not eligible to be bought to it's sugested retail price."
2,"i haven't finished, but its tough to",This book is difficult to start. I think the idea is interesting but I'm really having trouble picking this book up and reading it. I'm not the only one with that complaint either. Hopefully it gets better.
3,"Title very misleading, but an overall good read","The author tries a little too hard to connect globalization to the soccer (football) world, and pretty much comes up short on all vignettes, but he does do a fine job of explaining the underworlds of club hooligan gangs, and the ways they can influence the whole of society. He also explains many of the politics of the sport on several continents and how they differ and are similar. Globalization is touched upon the most in the section on the way clubs acquire and sell players across national boundaries and how they began to exploit players from Africa and South America to make soccer a truly international sport."
4,There is more to soccer than meets the eye,"It looks like a pure and simple game but the owners, fans and players are far from simple and certainly not pure. This book may not explain as much about the world as the author claims but I doubt you will not come to view various soccer matches a bit differently. For example, you might start watching the referee's decisions in Milan and Juventus matchs like a hawk."
4,Quirky--but intriguing--book,"This is a quirky work; it ends up proving more satisfying than one might have imagined. The subtitle:""An Unlikely Theory of Globalization."" That subtitle provides a takeoff point for the book. The author notes that (Page 5): ""On my travels, I tried to use soccer--its fans, its players, and strategies--as a way fo thinking about how people would identify themselves in this new era.""He explores the role of soccer by a series of case studies of teams--in Serbia, Scotland, Brazil, England, Jewish teams, the Ukraine, and so on.In the end, I am not sure how well he links these various nationalistic loyalties to teams with globalization.However, this is an intriguing book that gets one to thinking about much larger issues."
2,Redhawk,"I am a soccer fan an have a great interest in culture and history. This book did little to enlightment any of those subjects. As other reviewers have said it starts out rather depressingly, but then where I differ with others is that it doesn't get much better. I love the game of soccer and this book makes it into a rather depressing sport throughout. When one tries to explain a culture through sports, especially international soccer, one better have the historical ties nailed down, not just based one on because somebody told me so, or I think so kind of conclusions. Finally, I don't think there was much of a point to the book other than the author got to see a few great stadiums and teams play. For that I'm envious. There are other books like ""Soccer in Sun and Shadow"", or a 'Season With Verona"" that can give on a better feel of soccer and culture."
4,Theory way off...but VERY entertaining,"Foer would have done better by drawing parallels between soccer clubs and the communities those clubs represent. Much more so in Europe than in the US, professional sports are closely intertwined with politics and culture. As noted in this book, some owners use their soccer clubs as a political base of support. And in turn, many fans use the games and the clubs to express political points of view, sometimes verging on the extreme. (English Hooligans?) The corruption in Brazil's political structure manifests itself in the decline of the professional Brazilian league. Many of Brazil's top players move to Europe to enjoy the many benefits of less corrupt capitalist countries. While Foer's theory is way off base, the book is fascinating and a great read for anyone interested in soccer issues beyond the pitch."
3,"Interesting introduction to soccer, but poorly mislabeled.","After seeing the passion and pageantry that surrounds an Argentine football game, I was hoping to find a book that would help me develop a better appreciation for what I had just been a part of. There was, however, only one chapter to address football in South America and it was devoted entirely to Brazil. Likewise, there was one chapter on football in the Middle East and one dealing with North America. The rest of the book centers around European football clubs. For a book that sets out to explain the world, it is woefully eurocentric."
2,Poor copy of the original,This book is a poor copy of Simon Kuper's Football Against the Enemy. Everything covered here was done better (and a decade earlier) by Mr. Kuper.
2,Wish I Had Read Reviews First,"""How Soccer Explains the World"" came recommended from Amazon as similar to David Winner's ""Brilliant Orange"", which should be in a very different category all together. I loved Brilliant Orange and have long been ready for a similar book, but this was not it. Not only is the grasp of football (soccer) passable in this book the connections to society are clunky. Foer is a good writer, but as many others reviewers have pointed out his facts are a bit off and could have used much more research and deeper understanding of the non-football elements. I didn't come away with a deeper understanding of anything presented in this book.I not only wished I hadn't bought it, but not sure I will pass it along to the shelf for others to read at the community center."
2,Rip-off of an earlier work,"This book is a pretty blatant knock-off of an earlier (and better-written) book, Football Against the Enemy by Simon Kuper. That's the better book to buy. While I don't fault the author for wanting to cash in, it would be nice if he at least would acknowledge the inspiration for this book, rather than lamely pass it off as his own ""theory"". (Someone might also want to tell him that this is a hypothesis, not a theory.)"
2,"Good Idea, bad execution","I have to admit, some of the parts of this book have lingered with me, having read it over 5 years ago. The excerpt about being on a boat with Irish fans traveling to watch Celtic vs Rangers was escpecially fascinating.I have to say, however, that I was completely deflated by the chapter on Iran, which was based entirely on someone else's PHD thesis. If I'm forking out good money on a book about soccer globalization, the author should have at least taken the time to go to Iran himself and interview people. As an Jewish American, however, Foer was probably not looking forward to that trip.Foer is a pretty decent writer, and I breezed through most of the book, which says a lot. But he is not a seasoned investigative reporter yet, and that shows. A good first effort, and perhaps better stuff ahead from the author."
3,misleading title,"This was an easy and entertaining read but did little to ""explain the world""; it primarily detailed hooligan fans and corrupt officials."
3,To the Uninitiated...,"What does the average American know about the global picture of soccer? About as much as he or she knows about African politics or the migratory patterns of South American birds.Other reviewers have commented on specific aspects of this book, what it gets right, what it gets wrong, but for the uninitated American reader, the importance rests in simply an opening of the eyes to a wider world. I will probably find that much of what the other reviewers have said is true, but before I read this book, I had no clue about how the game has been played - in every sense of the phrase - in so many nations around the world."
4,A different way of looking at thing,"Overall a pretty interesting look at the world. The author looks at how different countries treat soccer, and what that says about their culture. Due to the fact that soccer is a pretty much universal sport, it does act as an interesting way to compare cultures. In fact one could make the argument that he actually leaves a lot of material on the table in examining cultures and economies through sport.My biggest complaint is that it often becomes way too travel essay like. I am glad he likes the game and all, but frankly his enjoyment of the sport isn't interesting enough, I had never even heard of the author previously. Stick to the game."
2,Glib and poorly researched,Foer has a good idea -- explain how the world works through the eyes of those involved in various soccer clubs -- but he does a pretty poor job with this book. Part of the problem is that he seems to want to do the least possible amount of work which means what he produces comes across as lazy and ill-informed. I wish he'd spent more time talking to more people in each of the countries he visited because you get the impression he spent about a weekend in each place. This is a disappointing book.
2,Easy read - poorly researched,"This book is an easy read and the author has an entertaining style of writing.HOWEVER - the stories of this book are badly researched and reflect his personal experiences/opinions rather than actual facts. The title of the book is misleading - there is no ""theory"" of globalization that he tries to prove or explain. Some of the facts he states are outrightly INCORRECT and some statements about the different countries/cultures quite outrageous.If you want to know a little bit about the different soccer teams and cultures in the world, go ahead and read this. But don't expect any great new knowledge of ""how soccer explains the world""."
4,Great Read....,As a first generation american (Italian/Polish) and a fan of football and politics I found Foer's book to be an intriguing read. I'd recommend it to anyone that either loves the game and would like to know more about the integration of the sport and religion/politcs as well as American detractors and novice soccer fans who'd like to know more about why the rest of the world is so infatuated with the game.
5,skin of the sky,"I have not received the item from Amazon yet but I already read the Spanish version, in fact I bought this English version to give it as a present to my colleges astronomers from UMass.I personally know Elena Poniatowska the author since she was married to Guillermo Haro My former boss at the INAOE (national institute for astrophysics...) in Mexico and the main character (as Lorenzo de Tena) in the novel.I enjoyed very much the novel because it was based upon this great Mexican astronomer Whom I was lucky to know and learn from him.Cesar Arteaga."
5,A Model Guidebook! Will be hard to beat this one,"This is what a guidebook should be like. I have traveled extensively around the world using many different guidebooks, but none have surpassed this one. Chris Humphrey has done a great job. He really understands the country and its people, and is a very good writer. This guidebook thoroughly covers the Honduran culture, customs, society, economy and history. It contains lots of interesting nuggets of information that will help you get more out of your trip. It also makes getting around and finding a place to stay and things to do very easy since the information is very accurate and up-to-date. Overall, this Honduras guide is hard to beat."
3,Moon Handbooks Honduras,"I should have looked more closely at the publishing date rather then the glowing reviews by other readers because most of the information is from 1999 (published in 2000) and is fairly out of date. Though I love the format and the amounts of information in the book I found myself using The Open Road Honduras Guide (2002) for my hotel, bus and pricing information. If you're going to Honduras this year I'd recommend the Open Road Guide - especially for E-mail and Web Site info as that tends to change very fast."
2,"Outdated, Only Valuable as History","Washington Gladden was a Progressive that wrote ""Who Wrote the Bible?"" in the year 1901. Many of the arguments in this book are outdated, disproved ideas of liberal theology. For instance, on the Bible Gladden writes that the Greek word ""graphe"", translated ""Scripture"", was not used as it is today until after 400 A. D. This was questionable in Gladden's day and has been proved false by archaeology, most notably by the discovery of a fragment of the Gospel of John dated at 125 A. D. John's gospel uses ""Scripture"" in a similar form that Christians use it today.Gladden was a revisionist who wanted a religion that would support the idea of the Kingdom of God on this earth (see Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Gladden). This book is an interesting study into the theologically liberal mind of the 20th century, but is not a book that one can depend on for factual information about the origin of the Bible."
3,Interesting and still relevant,"Other reviewers are correct that since this book was published, archaelogical discoveries (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1947) have changed the way we view the Bible. But this book still has a lot of very interesting information provided the reader bears in mind that some of it has been superceded. The discussions on Biblical inerrancy and fundamentalism, for example, are timeless and still very relevant today. It is a good free introduction to the origins of the Bible and the way in which a rational person should read it."
3,Interesting book,"It is an older book, but interesting in its perspective. Writer had his own perspective but obviously was trying very hard not to offend anyones religious views."
3,"good price, fast shipment","I actually could not use this product for my phone. I guess there are two different charger types for the LG VX8700 phone. This did not fit the bottom charging spot on the verizon phone that I have. Not the fault of the seller, but would be nice if they specified in the description. The picture is too small to tell if it would fit or not."
5,wonderful product with wonderful price,I paid a penny for this product and it works as well as any I have purchased from Verizon.
3,Tough Call,"""Greatest Hits"" albums for prodigious artists are typically a haphazard collection done for recording contract purposes or should be left for a comprehensive boxed set. The hook to this April 2001 release is the eight mid-tempo pieces from seven albums that was compiled by Bob Belden.The 48:53 spans an incredible time period - 1956-1985 - and must be viewed as more of a sampler for the curious and a necessary album for fans seeking a complete catalog for their library. It does not break any new ground and such a collection is crying out for alternate takes to make the album intriguing to more collectors/fans."
1,Unlikely to help your situation much...,"...i thought it was because I wasn't using Microsoft applications that I was having so much difficulty using Dragon but I've just observed the same behaviour within Microsoft applications!it frequently interprets the dictated text correctly (I can tell, since it's displayed in its status box), but does not perform the associated command or action. It even regularly types built-in command-text rather than executing the command!and no matter how many times I ""train"" it to learn certain words, these are misinterpreted.I'd go so far as to say this has aggravated my RSI since it requires so much training (and only runs on Windows, where i'm a UNIX user).Oh, and did I mention that it's a memory hog, regularly freezing my laptop, which exceeds its system requirements?!"
4,Better than previous versions but not perfect yet.,"I have used this version for a couple of years. It is faster and more accurate than previous versions that I have used. This version transcribes phrases rather than words - so you don't have to talk slowly word by word. But this adds errors in the ""little words"" that don't even sound similar.The Pro version adds features I like in creating custom words or phrases (scientific names in a specific font and in italics).Use a USB headset. It makes a major difference in recognition accuracy. I prefer Andrea NC -181VM USB. NC= noise canceling. It processes the sounds before sending to the computer, which creates better recognition accuracy.Dragon has a good product that I use everyday. Each Version has improved recognition. Version 9 made the greatest difference in ease of use and recognition accuracy."
1,Pay $10 each and EVERY time you call for support help!!,"I will definitely NOT buy this product. I refuse to be RIPPED OFF $10 for EACH AND EVERY time you e-maill or call customer service. This is totally ludicrous, and the support service should be included with the purchase of the product. Apparent Nuance Dragon Naturally Speaking is trying to squeeze every nickle and dime out of their customers. I refuse to by any product by a company that will do that to their customers. I think this is about the ONLY company that charges for their support. Try to find an alternative voice recognition software company who will support their product free of charge. SHAME ON YOU, NUANCE DRAGON NATURALLY SPEAKING."
2,Problematic,"Theoretically (when considering the advertised functionality) this is a magnificent programme. However, in practice things can be quite different.I have used this software in three different versions (7, 9, 9.5) on three different operating systems on five different computers and have always had many problems with bugs, ranging from annoying to dramatic (making the software completely unusable). When something doesn't work, it can be quite hard to solve the problem because the error messages often don't a lot, if you get an error message at all.I must say: I would not want to miss the software, if only because it is the only speech recognition software that can process Dutch as far as I know, so I have to depend on it. But I do think the software is in need of quite some improvement in terms of maturity (absence of bugs) and analysability (being able to find the source of problems, when there are any). Over the years, until now, I have not seen any progress in this respect."
5,Great to ahve around the house,Just the right size and weight. They work well around the house and would be great to take to a concert as well.
3,"Good, easy Sabbat Ideas","I have been using variations of these sabbat ideas for a long time. This book also has some good beginners info. Lots of easy to do, rituals."
2,ACK! No no no no no no!!!,"Terribly disappointing, giving no background, but lots of how-to. Odd odd rituals that don't correspond to anything!! The author seems to be in her own little world."
5,Excellent lantern!,Haven't had it out in the woods yet. But it puts out alot of light-Being smaller than its 2-burner cousins it should last quite a bit longer. Make sure u get a couple of the replacement #51 mantles as not everyone has them. I will buy another shortly!
3,There are better alternatives,"While this lantern works, there are a few drawbacks.1. The light it puts out isn't that bright.2. It is not very steady sitting on the propane cylinder. It is easy to knock over and break the top.3. It hisses a lot burning the gas to create light. And if you turn it up to be somewhat bright, it REALLY makes a lot of noise.There are good battery powered alternatives which have none of these drawbacks and are similarly priced, or less. Because of that, I cannot recommend this product."
2,Poor light output,"This product does not put out as much light as others of similar size. The light is also very yellow and the control knob has a cheap plastic feel to it and it does not rotate as smoothly as expected. This is not inline with the high quality construction of the rest of the lantern. Perhaps iv got a dud , but even if it is, Coleman should not have let this out their factory doors . I therefor rate it a 2 stars ."
4,Handy and compact,"I love this lantern- good light output, compact and comes w/ carrying chain. One drawback- it's very hard to find mantels for. I visited 5 local stores to find replacement mantels, before I finally found them at Kmart. I recommend buying mantels when ordering this product (to save money on shipping) or check availability locally first. Coleman Mantels #51"
4,Lightweight For Purists,"It is difficult to determine which lantern is actually best for your camping needs. This model uses `slip-on' mantles and matches, meaning you have to fuss with strings, but it only weighs about one pound for backpacking. The single mantle is plenty of light for night use. For purists, this might be the best, but I purchased the ""Coleman Northstar Instastart Tube-Mantle Propane Lantern"", which has two mantles and they are the `clip-on' style, which is so much easier than tying on mantles. However, it does weigh about four pounds. For pure lightweight backpacking, I'd go with this model, but if you can stand three more pounds or are car-camping, I'd recommend the ""Northstar InstaStart Tube-Mantle Lantern"", which also has metal globe guards. Either way, Coleman is the best."
5,Brighter & Useful,"I bought this exact single-mantle propane bottle lantern from my local Wal-Mart 2 years ago. I love lanterns, & this is a great start here. I have used it a few times camping. The lantern is brighter than you'd think, & is very useful since it's so bright! I am sure the more expensive dual mantle lanterns are brighter & fancier, but 2 or 3 of these one-mantle compact versions would be just as good I suppose. I like the chain, easily carried on the hike to the restroom. It could be called a 'personal lantern', yet is small enough for a basic campsite, say maybe 4 people with 2 tents nearby. One day I'll collect that beautiful classic green metal Coleman lantern (not the propane bottle style). Until then I am happy with what I have here. This must be easier to use since it requires no pumping & has only 1 mantle. The lantern I have does require matches (or a lighter) to light, which I prefer since it's fun to me. I realize I should camp out more :)"
1,$10 for EACH and EVERY call OR e-mail! Royal rip-off!,"I will definitely NOT buy this product. I refuse to be RIPPED OFF $10 for EACH AND EVERY time you e-maill or call customer service.

3,Does the job but room for improvement.,"I like this nice tripod bag! It holds my 055XPROB tripod and 488RC4 ballhead.Pros:Does the job, i.e. protects the tripod and head while traveling.Nice/professional looking design.Like the bottom handle.Efficient padding and ballistic nylon.Cons:Would appreciate a side handle, an inner pocket and maybe more flexibility (velcros, straps, hook, etc.).Would appreciate that the shoulder strap was padded.A bit heavy.Way too pricy--it doesn't make the pictures, it's just a bag!Bottom line:I recommend it but I hope designers to read this and improve its design!"
4,Big Bag - Does what a bag is supposed to...,"The bag is bigger than I expected, it is big for Bogen - Manfrotto 055MF4 Magnesium / Carbon Fiber 4 Section Tripod Legs with 3130 Micro Fluid Head with Quick Release - Tripod Legs/Head Support: 15.4 lbs/8.9lbs with a Bogen-Manfrotto 322RC2 Horizontal Grip Action Ball Head with RC2 Rapid Connect Plate (3157N) head attached. I still have room for my680 Compact Monopodwith room to spare. The bag is a bit bulky but unless I am hiking I would prefer to carry my tripod and/or monopod in hand it would be too much work to remove and replace a tripod if you are on a ""short outing"" (needless to say). I haven't taken the bag out often enough to comment on it durability in real world application, but it is constructed very well I have no issues with quality of the bag... Time will tell. I would reccommend this bag without reservations."
5,Excellent Quality,"I have a Manfrotto tripod with a Manfrotto pistol-grip ball head on it. Assembled, it is formidable and has a rather complicated shape, so I was skeptical about finding a carrying case that would fit it. No worries. This bag is absolutely letter-perfect for my setup, couldn't fit better! The zippers are logically placed for easy access, and the carry strap allows the bag to be slung over the shoulder and carried against your back without flapping around or slipping. A smaller strap on the bottom is a handy way to extract the case from the car, etc. The entire bag is quality from top to bottom, and is nicely padded to protect my investment. Definitely worth the extra $$ for the nice fit, form and function."
3,Just okay,I love Cameron's highlander grogg but Amazon doesn't seem to stock it so I thought I'd try this version. It's just okay. The flavors are not as distinct as others I've tried. I probably would not order it again.
1,Disappointed,"My husband has been buying his Highlander Grog for 4 years from a local coffee shop. Sadly they went out of business so I told him, No Problem. I will order you some online. I read all the reviews and decided on this product. We received it promptly and he was so disappointed!!! It does not compare at all to what he is used to and we are donating it to the local homeless shelter. I will try others online and try to find him something he likes, but this was not it."
3,Not really for the freezer.,"We use Ziploc containers on a VERY regular basis. We have used them over and over for leftovers. However, when using them for the freezer, the plastic gets very brittle and cracks easily. I've had quite a few that once in the freezer they slip and if they hit the side of the freezer they crack, if they hit the ground - forget it. They will shatter. For regular use they are fantastic, reheats well in the microwave and we've had many for years. Just not suggested for the freezer."
2,Lids do not fit,"I purchase these knowing the lids won't fit previous purchases.It's a pain going through all the lids to find one that fits.No, they are not made for the freezer. I get freezer burn within 10 days.They are OK for potlucks when you don't want to take them home or for dry goodsin the cubboard. Hot foods melt them and probably give off some sort of gas thatmay contaminate my food."
1,DO NOT BUY PANASONIC!!!,"Aside from the annoying load times and the fact that it broke after the first 9 months, this was a pretty good DVD player otherwise.I got this player as a gift to replace a vintage player from the late 1990's. In contrast it was a pretty bad move, while my old player would load a disc in no time flat, the Panasonic would take about 30-45 seconds to read the disc BEFORE it began playing.It was something I could live with, but I wouldn;t have to for long. After about 9 months the thing started showing error H07. BLAST. I started to Google and came to realize I was not the only person with this problem.I contacted Panasonic via Email, they informed me that I would have to ship my player away and would be charger labor to repair the player.Seeing mixed results on the web, and with a hefty price tag of approx.85-100 for the repair I decided against it, and pulled my old payer out of the closet.I WILL NEVER BUY PANASONIC ANYTHING ever again."
4,Not a DVD Audio player,"Contrary to Amazon's listing, this is not a DVD-Audio player. Yes, it will play DVD-Audio discs, (as ANY DVD-Video player can), but it does not have the high-resolution DAC's and 6 component outputs that are required for it to qualify as a DVD Audio player."
3,great--for a while,I loved this thing for three years and four months--one of the best birthday presents I ever received. And then the fateful H07 error...
1,H02 Error ... Beware,"Before you buy a Panasonic DVD player do a google search on ""Panasonic H02"". You will discover that it appears there is a problem with these units. I had mine for 30 days got the error and had to send it away for warranty repair about 13 months later it happened again. Not under warranty I have to junk it now...what a bad decision to buy this unit. Customer service is also terrible."
2,"Horrible remote, front panel controls, and manual","I've owned dozens of audio/visual products and remotes. This Panasonic is incredibly frustrating to use because the remote and the front panel controls are the worst I've ever seen. Nothing is intuitive and the play/stop/rewind/forward buttons on the remote are about the size of grains of rice and are difficult to find among the sea of buttons on the remote. The play/stop/rewind/forward buttons the ones used 90% of the time -- make the bloody things larger than the others and easy to find. The remote isn't backlit either, and to activate the buttons you've got to mash them ALL the way down.Changing discs is a pain, too. Sometimes it just doesn't want to, no matter what you do with the remote. Changing DVDs at the unit is maddening, too. I'd go into it, but I'd be writing all day. Oh, the manual is horrible, too.That being said, once you get the ...thing playing the disc you want it to, the picture and sound quality is really good...."
1,H07 Error Code,I bought a DVD for my son within the last 2 years and now the unit is displaying error code H07. Do not buy Panasonic.
1,Buyer Beware!,"This player was great...while it worked. Unfortunately, this was only for about 6 months, soon after this time it began displaying an H02 error code and would not play any discs. After being on hold for almost an hour, Panasonic informed me that I would have to ship it for repairs and pay $85! After researching a bit online, I found that this is a common problem with this player and often will happen again after being repaired. Definitely consider a different brand if you want a high quality piece of equipment that will last."
4,Great(minus the remixes)!,This cd is worth picking up especially for the price and if you are like me and want to get all of your favorite bands cds. The only downside causing me to give it 4 stars are the remixes which are awful. But besides that the other non-remixe songs are great. Get this and their others if you are a new fan or a long time one.
4,"Very good, an epic EP.","Oh how I love this EP. It sounds like it could've been one for Undecieved. The three new songs are very good, and show that Extol is awesome as always.My only problem is the remixes. Yes, I am one of those who hates remixes. Do yourself a favor, listen to the originals, its better in the end.All in all, a great lick from a black metal legend!"
1,Missing pices,I don't know if this book is good or bad since there are missing pieces and it took me a long time to get it.
4,The most adorable critters on earth?,"The pictures in this book are utterly wonderful. If you like cute and cuddly, this one's for you. Harp Seal pups are, I think, one of nature's wonders (how could anyone club one over the head?) The book is great and is almost wholly a picture book. If there had been more text, it would have rated 5 stars. Totally scrumptious"
4,A book about life-saving,"This book describes several types of risky, potentially self-sacrificing, life-saving behavior: a village in France that sheltered Jewish refugees during WW II, a German commander who looked the other way, a 19th-century Massachusetts sailor who saved dozens of people from shipwrecks, and a modern drug counselor (though her story doesn't really fit in with the other stories very well, since her efforts were apparently not as successful).The most interesting thing about this book is how little Hallie's heroes/heroines have in common: some were religious, some secular, some quiet people who led boring lives (other than the lifesaving of course), some wild and a little self-destructive. Ultimately, Hallie leaves the impression that this sort of self-sacrificing goodness is as much a mystery as is evil."
2,Poor Character Movement,"Most of the puzzles are fairly easy...However, the attempt to enter the office at the Cement Works displays the lack of controlone has over Sherlock's movements resulting in a very tediousand time consuming snag in a relatively interesting game...."
4,I liked it,"I thought it was fun, though I did have to consult the walk-through for hints on the card game which I still don't get. Plus my computer had a virus so every few seconds i had to close a pop up but playing it was better than doing nothing. The chess game was fun. I thought the dog and watchman parts were pretty hard. I liked the clues, I liked the plot. In General, a fun game I think. I really liked the memorize the forest to beat the clock game."
3,Not the funnest game I imagined!,"I guess if all you are looking for is to find clues and solve the mystery, this game is definitely for you but it does lack imagination. I would love to see a whodunit game that involves some fantacy and some creative problem solving as well as clue finding and mystery solving. The best game I have ever played thus far and have yet to find a game to match it is ""The Longest Journey"". If anyone knows this game and a game that comes close, please email me at kborba@comcast.net."
4,"Great book, bad citations.","This is a neat little book summarizing the flora and fauna of Big Bend National Park. It covers plants, birds, mammals, invertebrates, fish, and reptiles and amphibians, and provides a brief history. It is not an identification guide, but a listing of species of interest with some facts about them. There are better resources of information about birds and plants, but the other topics are rarely covered elsewhere aside from checklists available at the park.My only problem with this guide is that they have provided in-text citations that are not in the bibliography! If you are going to cite sources in the text, please provide complete information *somewhere*. The bibliography lists lots of great sources, just not ALL of the sources used in the book. This lack of attention to detail is the reason I gave this book anything less than 5 stars."
3,Birder/Botanist reviews the book,"A good set of lists, with location, for the various natural species found in Big Bend. Unfortunately drawings are not to scale and are not near the plant descriptions. The decriptions do not include any identifying characteristics such as bundles and number of needles, etc. The drawings are in black and white. It would be difficult to take with you as it is not eay to identify items by the descriptions and or drawings. You would need a plant book and bird book and tree book all in color to help you."
4,Good Introduction,"I'm not a naturalist, so I can't tell if this book lives up to its title. However, as a person interested in geology, geography, topography, and flora and fauna, I did find the book enjoyable and useful as an overall guide to Big Bend. Most of the photos are black and white, though there's a center section of color photos. Also, I enjoyed being introduced to the history of the Big Bend area.The bibliography is extensive: 39 pages of a 185-page book. There's also a 10-page index.Recommended."
5,Great Tutorial,"This tutorial offers help to improve every telephone interaction a company has with its valued customers. Beyond ""Hello"" includes exercises, stories and examples of how attitude, telephone etiquette, communication styles and listening skills impact the bottom line.Each chapter contains tips to help make a great first impression, enhance customer interaction and retain and strengthen client relationships through excellent customer service over the telephone.A ""must read."""
5,Fantastic Guide,"I've had the opportunity to work with Jeannie while printing a recent copy of my newsletter on professional conduct. Beyond ""Hello"" is an easy to read, comprehensive guide that can help anyone improve and sharpen his or her phone skills. I highly recommend this book and include it as required reading for my entire staff. Congratulations Jeannie on a book well done!-- Clint Greenleaf"
5,It's been great!,"We got this stroller in 2004 when our daughter was born and it is still going strong 6 years later! It has a lot of miles on it as my wife used to do most of her shopping walking to the stores and malls within a couple miles of our home. The oversized basket is great for groceries, traveling, taking picnics to the park. And the stroller handles very well (love the never flat tires--wish I could say the same for the jogging strollers we have) and has been very comfortable for both our kids (in fact, we did, on numerous occasions, squeeze both our 4 year old and 18 month old into the stroller at the same time by reclining the seat all the way to make a large, flat surface for them to sit on.)"
5,Good Speakers for music and home theater system,"I bought these a month ago and hooked it up to my ... amp. They sounded really good the bass was high for music, but For home theater you might need a sub-woofer to pump up the low bass. I have listened to many speakers but could not tell the difference between these and the ones that cost [$$$]a pair. I also have [another set] at home, but these sound as good or even better. I will recommend this to anyone for the sound quality, style and price."
4,Lots of Possibilities,"This foam mat puzzle has many possibilities. The pieces can be lined up in order from 1-9, pieced together to form a square as shown, lined up and used as a ""road"" for toy cars, pieced together to form a box, stacked, shaped into a tunnel for toy cars, wet and stuck to the side of the bath tub, and much more. For such an inexpensive play-thing, children can come up with some pretty creative ways to play with it! It's foam, so if your child likes to chew on things, it could be dangerous as the foam tears and comes off easily. So it is not a good idea for babies or teething toddlers. Otherwise, pick your kids' favorite characters and watch them be entertained!"
5,Must-read,"I concur with most of these reviews. This is a powerful, unforgettable work. If you're new to Tolstoy, this is a good place to start. If you're not new to him, but haven't yet read this one, grab it. As for the lone negative voice, Scott Gates' review (below) says far more about him than about ""Resurrection."""
3,"Deep, heavy, and moralistic","Maybe the first modern novel. In `Resurrection' Tolstoy delves down deep into the disturbed psyche of his protagonist as he struggles with his decisions, his culture, and his beliefs. Like all of Tolstoy's works the book is as deep and the prose is heavy. There are times that the book reads more like a tract than a novel and there is a moral to every story. The book is interesting, too, in that I've wondered how much personal history Tolstoy wrote into it. Readers of Troyat's biography will see many familiar scenes played out here from Tolstoy's early days as a rich dandy to his later `resurrection' as a spiritual nomad.Not quite up to par with `Anna' or `War and Peace' but a good book and a must for fans of the Great One."
4,"One of Tolstoy's best, but not the best.","This book gave me a new perspective at looking at society. After reading this book the wrongs and should-be-rights of my society hit me on the back of the head. Though this is not the best of Tolstoy's work, it should be read by all who love literature and all who want something to stimulate the psyche with something new."
2,Typo in the first paragraph!,"The Empire Books edition of this classic has a typo in its first paragraph: ""paying the ground with stones"" should read ""paving"" not ""paying"". With an error in the first 100 words, I'm wondering about the rest. Fortunately we can choose the translation we want. Amazon also offers the Oxford Classics version - where the streets are paved, not payed."
3,"Deep, heavy, moralistic - all the things we love about the Count","Maybe the first modern novel. In `Resurrection' Tolstoy delves down deep into the disturbed psyche of his protagonist as he struggles with his decisions, his culture, and his beliefs. Like all of Tolstoy's works the book is as deep and the prose is heavy. There are times that the book reads more like a tract than a novel and there is a moral to every story. The book is interesting, too, in that I've wondered how much personal history Tolstoy wrote into it. Readers of Troyat's biography will see many familiar scenes played out here from Tolstoy's early days as a rich dandy to his later `resurrection' as a spiritual nomad.Not quite up to par with `Anna' or `War and Peace' but a good book and a must for fans of the Great One."
3,I finished it,I thought that I would put this book down for good several times but I pushed through and finished it. It will certainly be my first and last Tolstoy novel. Maybe I was expecting more but this book was not insightful or thought provoking whatsoever. I found it dry. I only read it to the end because I thought that it might come to some great conclusion but it didn't.
4,exploration of conscience,"In the same wonderful tradition of Russian literature, this story of one's courageous journey to explore personal and collective conscience is an example of the power of good literature. It confronts the questions about evil, injustice, religion, and ultimately the true meaning of redemption and forgiveness. The middle part of the story is quite political and to me, felt rather limiting at times, however, this is no doubt,another masterpiece by Tolstoy."
4,An interesting read,"I enjoyed this book. If you can bear with Tolstoy's socialist ideaology you might too. He presents a very captivating moral scenario and, as always, displays incredible insight into human motives and behaviors. The story is not nearly so long as Anna Karenina, but every bit as fascinating. Here Tolstoy presents a unique story with wonderful sensitivity to the human condition."
4,Excellent for Brutally Honest Introspection,"In this raw novel Tolstoy unleashes his strongest and most poignant social criticisms and displays his deep understanding of human nature. It's an uncomfortable read because of its piercing ability to dig through layers of self-deception and make readers face themselves with total honesty. Anyone who appreciates Arbinger Institute material, such as The Bonds that Make us Free and The Anatomy of Peace, should read this book.This doesn't quite achieve the power of other classics, such as Les Miserables, Uncle Tom's Cabin, War and Peace, and the Brothers Karamazov, but it definitely belongs in the same class.Tolstoy forces you to confront societal flaws, but some of his thinking in this novel smacks as unrealistically utopian. However, this makes for great discussion material."
3,nothing bad but haven't we been here before?,"Defected records rock,period. This collection of club 'hits' however has a bit of a too familiar feel owing to the manner of track inclusion based on popularity. I would have thought Defected were a bit above that?The packaging is cliched which doesn't help and for some reason my bonus dvd wouldn't load and play properly.Having said that there are some slamming tracks like the Praise Cats 'Shined on me' and Martin Solveig and Blaze are featured to keep the party going, but do we need another comp with the fantastic but over licensed 'Rise' by Eddie Amador?Still good but next time I will stick to the D.J sets of which there are many with the German issued Jazz-n-Groove session being an all time fav."
5,Good for the classroom,"This is a good short art history film for the classroom. It is not the most entertaining movie in the world but it does seem to hold the students' attention well enough. The film reviews works by Lichtenstein, Warhol, and Thiebaud and provides quizzes throughout where they can guess which artist painted the picture based on style. It is a good way to begin to teach students how to recognize an artist's work by the way they paint. I used this movie for 4th grade. I think it would be good for middle school as well. The other good thing about this DVD is that there are no ""questionable"" points in the film (no nude artwork). It is very school appropriate."
5,Trance Fans Must Buy This CD !!,"This CD is awesome !!! Every song is good and the mix flows better than a river flows downstream. It has to be the best one in the Trance nation series. I bought this Cd used from a buyer in australia off Amazon and when I listened to it, it was well worth the wait !! After the let down of the Trance Nation Electric disc this set restored my faith in this series. If your a Trance Addict like me, buy this cd. It is a must have for all Trance Fans."
3,Trance Nation,"This is a good CD it usually takes me a few listens to appreciate a CD so this one is getting better. I really am more into Gao trance and rarely buy CDs like these but I loved a Gatecrasher (Disco Tech) CD I bought a while a go and though I would direct my CD buying power that way again. I would have preferred the tracks to be a little longer on this set but they are slightly more so than those on the Disco Tech set. over all a good disk for this style but pricey, it seems that most good sets of this style are expensive though."
5,LOVE SANTA ESMERALDA MUSIC,"GREAT SPANISH GUITAR VERY NICE GOOD MUSIC ,ONE OF MY FAVORITES FROM THE 70S SANTA ESMERALDA ,,,LOVE THE REMIX VERSION OF HOUSE OF THE RISING SUN PURE GOLD.."
4,Glam Punk Gem,"The STIVS were an awesome Portland based band that unfortunately didn't really go anywhere. Eventually dissolving, this release captures a loud,fast, and raw band at their height. Produced by Jack Endino, this release is more refined than the beat is loose with a tighter sound and some brand new tunes. Listening to this album leaves you wishing this band could have had a couple more in their catalog, and were still hanging around so you could see them."
3,The Poison Tree,"Richie Jahnke is sick of the way his father, Richard Jahnke is treating him, his mother,Maria, and his sister Deborah. He's always beating on them, using high levels of verbal abuse and embarassing them by harassing other people in public. Richie decides to put an end to it once and for all. This true story tells how the family went through so much abuse, Richie's revenge and the aftermath. I felt this book could have been a little better than the back cover said it was. Though it was interesting to see that the children waited 18 years to even do anything about how their father was treating them. I personally would have done something about it a lot sooner than that. I appreciate my parents a lot more, and am glad they aren't as cruel as the Jahnke's."
2,Beware! Misleading Description!,"The chew rope I received (and then in stock) was much smaller than described: It weighed 6.2 oz. not. 1.1 lb.; its length was 15"", not 32""; it had 2 knots, not 3 knotsBooda Fresh N Floss 3 Knot Tug Rope Dog Toy, X-Large, Winter Mint. On the positive side, EntirelyPets readily refunded my money including S&H;."
1,Incorrect Product Description,"This review does not speak to the product's merits and faults since I was not able to use it.Instead, this review is with regards to the Technical Details (part of the product description).TECHNICAL DETAILS:A part of the technical details section is false and I had based my purchase decision on the information found in the technical details. The first bullet under the technical details state, ""Tiny-Sized, Approximately half the size of an MMCplus Card, but with all the features and performance"". This is simply not true. The size of the card is the same as an MMCPlus or SD card, not half their size. As a result, this MMC did not fit in my mobile phone (Nokia N70).UPDATE (06-14-2010) The seller was kind enough to provide a full refund of the purchase price and shipping charges due to the misinformation. I am changing the seller's customer service rating as a result of their willingness to standby the products they represent."
4,Satan - 'Court In The Act' (Metal Mind),"Originally came out in 1983, this was the 'New Wave Of British Heavy Metal' band's (from Newcastle) first of two albums. Barely remember these guys as the info page lists just two members (for this lp, anyway): Brian Ross-vocals and Graeme Nichol-bass & guitar. Tracks I found to my liking were ""Trial By Fire"", the head-banging ""Broken Treaties"", ""Hunt You Down"", the heavy-duty ""Pull The Trigger"" and both the single and lp version of ""Break Free"". Fans of Pariah, Angel Witch, Judas Priest and maybe Praying Mantis should get something good here."
2,Dissapointed,"It seems all thos forgotten albuns of NWOBHM are now regarded as ""predecessors of speed metal"", ""originators of trash"", things like that.This album is perfunctory in a lot of ways. Bad production, anemic vocals, so and so guitar work, bad melodies."
2,Was fine at first,"I bought this about 6 months ago as a helper to my almost famous apple sause and pie filling. At first it was great, got through 9lbs of apples in just over 30 mins. Then I made the mistake of peeling a red delicious apple for my daughter's snack. It couldn't do it! I figured maybe the apple was to big and I had the wrong settings. I adjusted over and over at least 3 different batches. Maybe 1/3 worked. Worse after the red insident it stopped working for any apple! Turning more than half the apples to mush on the core, unable to use on this peeler.So if you only need it for 1-2 jobs, or never EVER adjust the settings once it works, then its fine. Otherwise its not worth the cost to return it"
3,Book marred by poor interviews,"The movie is astounding, but this book is less than great because the interviewer of cast and crew was amateurish at best. EVERYONE was asked: ""What did you think of the sets?"" and ""What was it like working with (fill in the blank)?"". Those are the type of questions one would expect of a high school journalist. Some of the interviewees, however, managed to rise above the questions and provided some interesting insights into the film and it's making. The photos are very good, but don't show much of the ""behind the scenes"" perspective that would have been interesting. Get the book if you loved the movie as I do, but be aware that it is more of a coffee-table book than an exhaustive making-of book."
5,Incredible,"Thumbing through this book in the bookstore, I decided to see Gangs of New York in the theater. The movie was an incredible experience -- gorgeous, stirring, horrifying, thrilling, heart-poundingly beautiful. A great story. Superb acting. What research! Direction, cinematography, set design, costume design, casting, on and on -- brilliant. A period of history seldom visited, little known, that has such a powerful effect on who and where we are today. (And since I had lived blocks from Five Points for five years, in the East Village, a personal connection... ) The next day I returned to the bookstore, thumbed through the book again, and understood even more. I'm ordering it now. If you love history, and love America, see the movie (though you will cover your eyes on some parts!) Then buy this book."
3,The book and the movie,"I have seen the movie and read this book about the making of the movie. I am struck by the interviews done with the actors and the production people involved with the making of this movie. They all agree on two things: That Martin Scorsese is a genius and that they were not terribly impressed with ""The Gangs of New York"" by Herbert Asbury upon which this movie is based. Scorsese may be a genius but his movie is not a work of genius. It is a flawed work which never quite comes together and therefore does not satisfy. Asbury's book will live on long after the movie is forgotten."
2,Terrible,"I really enjoyed the 1st novel. This one I could have gone without. If you're a die-hard Brian Hodge Fan, then you'll probably like the book. I hope this was just an off-day for the author."
2,The Tailor of Gloucester: A Family Musical for Christmas,"Poor quality, very poor production, poor acting (Ian Holms, aka Bilbo Baggins, was pathetic as the tailor). Apart from a couple of sweet scenes of the children's ballet as mice, this movie is embarrassing. Don't waste your money or time on it."
3,"Peaceful, relaxing . . . and anonymous","Acoustic guitar, gently played, with mostly unrecognizable melodies, and the sounds of waves crashing to start each song off. So yes, it's relaxing, but it's definitely environmental or ambient, as it's meant to stay in the background. It's also anonymous - no writing or performing credits - and it's cheap, having been repackaged for release in a number of markets, ultimately including dollar stores. Nice to mix with mellow Jimmy Buffett as the sun goes down at the beach . . ."
2,Headache,"Do not expect this product to work with any D-Link ethernet device, e.g. router, switch, ethernet to wireless bridge. Also don't expect any type of tech support. The people you end up talking to expect an education from you.If you want to stream mp3's from your PC, this product only works with an old version of MusicMatch Jukebox v7.2 MusicMatch in general is very unstable and I for one cannot get it work at all in Windows XP. It does work though when I log in as Administrator.If you have a lot of time on your hands to try and get this stereo working properly go ahead and give it a try."
3,Good reference for beginners,"This book may help you to start with shortwave listening. It is a good reference, from choosing the most suitable receiver to building your own antenna. It is, however, too US-centric. European or Asian listeners may find 50% of the book useless..."
3,NOT SO GREAT,It is not as compelet as it can be. You are better off buying other books with more details
2,Subpar in all respects ...,"We took this book on a 2-week vacation and my kids (twin sons, 7) and I had plenty of time to look at this book, and compare it to ""Amazing Spiderman : Volume 3"". There's simply no comparison. The stories in this comic are silly, meaningless. The best that can be said is that the opening story has a decent puzzle inside, which ends with a bunch of malarky.One of the last stories in the book features a darkly bearded ""superman double"" and you get the impression that the illustrator was just being lazy and only wanted to draw super_men (one in blue, one in grey), and that a whole story was developed so that the illustrator could be lazy.meanwhile, spiderman stories had ironies, ethics, the 5th estate, cleverness, and many, many, many things to recommend them. this book had none of that.this book is totally forgettable. My kids now think superman is boring. This is the WRONG first superman book to buy for your kids."
4,What's the Big Secret?: Talking about Sex with Girls and Boys,An excellent reference book to help parents in talking with their school age children about sex.Came highly recommended by a good friend who used it to talk about sex to her children.
3,Not good enough in a field of excellent titles.,"The light tone of this book helps make the topic a little less serious - but instead of being funny, it's overly cute and tiresome. The pages are cluttered with cartoonish drawings, and there's not enough content to make it stand out on a shelf with other books of its kind. Kirkus Reviews suggests that ""the book errs by providing both too much information and too little,"" with complicated descriptions of physiology, but not enough explanation of coitus or ejaculation."
4,Good learning tool,"This is a very thourough and informational book that kids can read on their own or with a parent. I have noticed that my 9 year old son has read it on his own and he feels more comfortable asking me questions when he has a reference point. This book is purely from an anatomy standpoint, it is not written from a religious perspective, so I would recommend that it is paired with other books discussing the Lords plan for sex (marrage etc)."
4,Amazing book...,"I purchased this book for my now 8 year old 3 years ago when we had some questions she was asking about her body and I wasn't quite sure how to answer correctly. In the beginning there were some parts we skipped over but as she got older she's read the entire book (she is very smart and mature for her age) now that I am pregnant for the 3rd time, it has been instrumental in helping explain the process of what's going on in my body in a way she understands that is totally age appropriate. She actually brought it to me the other day and we used it to discuss the process of what's going on in my body. This book is amazing!!!"
2,The title is misleading...,"The title of this book would lead one to believe that the book focuses on the topic of sex. Unfortunately, there is only one sentence about sexual intercourse in the whole book and it is not very descriptive. There is a decent description of fertilization and a baby growing in the uterus but in terms of the act that got the baby to grow in the first place, there is very little. Also be sure that you are ready to talk about masturbation because there is more informaiton in the book about that than on intercourse. Overall, I was disappointed. I was looking for a book with enough information to start the conversation with my kids but this leaves so much out I might as well not use it at all."
1,Choose another book--this one conflicts with moral values,"We feel it vital to teach our young children about such topics as soon as they are ready to fully understand them (age 8 in our opinion) and this we have done, but this particular book contains too many conflicting moral issues for us to use as a text to share with our children. A much better choice for our family was ""Amazing You"" and ""Changing You"". We had mild differences with these texts, but they proved to be great discussion starters with the children. ""What's the Big Secret"" went too far across vital moral lines for us to even consider using as discussion material. To each his own, but we wanted to post in case others wanted a heads-up."
1,Inappropriate,"The reading level is 4-8 years old, and it is written for kids younger than preschool-5th grade. The content is totally inappropriate for children that young, and it should not be in elementry school libraries for them to check out at will. What happened to parents raising their own children. I am tired of everyone trying to ""parent"" my children when they are outside of the home. Teach them to read, write and do math...that is what school is for...an that is it!"
4,Not a secret any more,"We have 2 kids (girl and boy), ages 8 and 10. The book was good for both of them. Some laughs and giggles but the message got across to them both. Lots of appropriate pictures to help the message."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"I got this for my 9 y.o. who has started asking a lot of questions. It was an easy way to get the discussion going. It gave him good information, without being overly clinical and boring, and allowed me to fill in whatever information he still had questions about."
4,Nicely done,"WtBS handles a sensitive subject, well, sensitively. The book provides just enough detail about the mechanism of making a baby without being overwhelming for young ones. Your child will learn the actual physical acts involved.Both my 6 and 4 year olds loved the book, though with varying degrees of comprehension. They request it as bedtime reading from time to time. This was the perfect book to use to answer my six year old's ""How are babies made?"""
2,Disappointing,"I typically like anything lemon; however,this is a big disappointment. It has a ""fake"" lemon flavor and is a bit too sweet. Sometimes makers of products containing non-sugar sweeteners have a tendency to overdo it. Although the chocolate and chocolate cappuccino flavors are wonderful, I would definitely skip this lemon version."
1,"Book is misnamed -- should be ""The High-Tech Fertility Book""","If you're looking for what the title of this book promises, look at Sheila Kitzinger's ""Birth Over Thirty-Five"" instead, a sensitive and far-ranging exploration of many, many issues of interest to the mature woman who is pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant.Nagle's book is NOT, by any means, a ""complete sourcebook for starting (and restarting) motherhood beyond 35 and after 40."" It would be better billed as a sourcebook for information about a wide range of super-high-tech methods for getting pregnant. That is the topic of the bulk of the book. Emphasis is definitely on the high-tech. The existence of natural, holistic approaches is given cursory mention only."
4,Everything you need to know in one book,"This book is not about humor, or girlfriend-to-girlfriend banter. It states all the facts before, during, and after the decision to tackle motherhood beyond the conventional age. There are resources and facts about fertility options, adoption (the author and her husband adopted a child from Russia) and all the other challenges to be faced. It is very honest about the pros and cons of late-life motherhood, the risks and the rewards, and it is good to have all this information in one volume, rather than having to hunt for the information elsewhere."
5,Great sourcebook,"I highly recommend this book for anyone thinking of becoming an ""older mother"". This book is incredibly complete. I especially like all the questions to ask yourself. It will help you answer questions you didn't even know you had!"
4,Lots of information but...,"As a soon to be 40+ mom (hopefully) I read this hoping for support and guidance. Although there is a lot of info. in the book and I'm sure it's all true, I felt it a little on the pessimistic side. If I weren't so determined and strong minded, I might be really put off the whole idea of trying for a baby after reading the negative stuff. Good source for stats, though."
2,Not Particularly Useful,"I purchased this book when at age 40 I learned I was pregnant for the first time. I was hoping it would address medical and psychological issues with becoming a mother at this age but rather I found a meandering discussion about adoption, surrogacy and infertility. Its more of a vague discussion of options to consider if you are thinking about becoming a mother past age 35. If you are in fact pregnant or have a child coming this book provides precious little insight.A much better book is Your Over 35 Week by Week Pregnancy Guide by Dr Shanahan"
3,need more info about daddy's role,"I know this book is about mid-life *motherhood* but there was very little information about how daddy fits into the whole scene. My husband is going to be a stay-at-home Mr. Mom to our children and there was almost no information about this ""growing phenomenon"" in the working section. There was plenty about starting your own homed based business but I don't find that option very realistic, or appealing, frankly. Other than that I found the book to be a good overview of things to think about."
2,Lack of inputs make it all but useless,"Although the unit does everything it advertises, it leaves out one critical piece of functionality that I literally could not believe when I opened the box. There are no inputs whatsoever. No S-Video, Composite, or even Audio. I thought I was getting a combination DVD player and receiver with speakers, but there is nothing ressembling a receiver here.Unless you plan on using your surround sound system *exclusively* for movies or audio CDs, stay away from this otherwise seemingly amazing unit. It does have a single set of outputs (S-Video/Composite/Stereo), but that hardly seems like the important part here. Panasonic missed the mark.I wish there were other similar vertical units, as I will be saddened to return this, but without inputs... it's very, very limited."
1,For free:,"Very good book, interesting for people working on the Date Palm, but the very same book, with even a better quality, is for free on Archive.orgHere exactly: http://www.archive.org/details/dategrowinginold00poperich:-)"
3,It needs more!,"Its great-but only if you cared for the main themes, of course THE metal Gear theme we all know and love- but really all this had was all the cinematic tunes and Boss battles. What I really wish this had was EVERY SONG like the 2 disc ""MGS3; Snake Eater"" , I woulda have really enjoyed it if there was the ambient cool-jazz background music you hear as you roam the Big Shell, partcularly the tune you hear while sneaking about the Dining Hall. But if its just the stuff I mentioned above you are lookin for, youve found it."
2,Not what we wanted,Very basic - did not capture any of our attention. Even though my kids like non digital toys - this was hard to play for very long.
4,Good basic educational activity,"I grew up with Geosafari 25 years ago. It was so enjoyable and challenging. I learned alot. When my son turned 5 I thought it was time to get him one. It is perfect for our household. We do not have Television but rather watch occasional Netflix. I do not have video games or alot of electronic gadgets. Because of that, this older technology is not competing with current things. My kids 4 and 6 now, both enjoy doing the cards. Some are easy and others require that your child already know how to read - which for my 6 year old is perfect. This is a fantastic thing to have for travelling as well as single play. It may not be the right thing for you if your child is used to computer programmed games, etc."
5,Touching and soul searching,"I recently got to see and hear the story about this wonderful book from the author.He sang the song and accompanied himself on the piano, it was thrilling to hear the depth of feeling in this beautiful song. This book should be a holiday classic and be treated as a gift to all who read and hear it. The illustrations are beautiful and can be enjoyed by all ages."
4,Nice story - difficult song,The story is a nice sentiment. The song is slow and difficult to sing. I used the book with children 4-8 but couldn't teach them the song.
2,Not what I expected,"This book was not at all what I excepted. I was hoping it would be a nice lesson teaching, heart warming book for the holidays. I was disappointed :("
2,A bombastic book,"This title describes the history of linguistics as one periodization after another, this leads to an avalanch of information, that leaves one feeling barried. As one of my classmates said, the author sucks off all the meat and presents the bones. A dull and overly informative read."
3,Looks good but clogs easily,We bought this to match an old one that broke. For some reason it clogged completely from the first brand of soap we loaded into it. It took some work to get it cleared but have had no problems since. Great as long as you don't put thicker soap in it.
3,Only for the Collector,"Even though St. Anger blew, I still am a fan of the band and I continue to collect their releases. The reason I bought these St. Anger singles (This disk is 1 of 2) was for the bonus tracks that are only available on this disk. These two bonus tracks, Commando and Today Your Love Tomorrow The World are two tracks that were recorded during the Ramones sessions when they were asked to record a cover for the Ramones tribute album (53rd & 3rd won out). Commando, even though it only clocks in at a 1:48, is rather good. I liked that cover. Today Your Love, Tomorrow the World was also rather good. These two covers are nothing major. Not worth getting if your not a collector."
5,amazing song,"The riff to this song is so good! Metallica just keep doing it, they just keep churning out some of the best music that's out there. The Ramones covers on the single are pretty good too. They do a [great] job on Commando."
4,"Mejor Mejora Mejoral, ROCKS!","Que se puede decir de Metallica: Un clasico pa' la caga. Los medios riff's? Si, pero ahora no. Unas weas pa la caga que parecen cualquier wea menos lo que deberian ser. Es mala la wea y mas encima terrible tranfu. No se que culiao se podria comprar este disco reculiao que es mas malo que la chucha. Se lo recomiendo a los amantes de Limbichki y a los mal paridos como Morgado."
1,Don't bother,"Now that it is offical that they sold out (a.k.a. the Metallica dolls) and their latest sorry attemp at a song, not to mention what they consider ""art"" on their covers. I for one can say that this singe isn't worth the plastic used for the CD case. Don't bother, it ... (and yes, it is THAT bad)."
1,"Where's the ""INTEGRITY OF THE ALBUM"" now boys?!?!?!","Metallica are a bunch of liars!!! They don't sell singles via iTMS due to them, supposedly, wanting to maintain ""the integrity of the album"". Yet, they sell them as CD singles!?!?!?!?! What a bunch of hypocritical liars!!!!!On top of all that, the title track is on BOTH of the CD singles!!! Don't buy their newer stuff, it sounds terrible and they lie to their fans!!!"
4,"Great for getting ""stuck in"" with RPG'ing","Well, seeing as I have never read an RPG rulebook, let alone played a game, I guess I am as new as can possibly be, so I have no frame of reference.This being said, I am the happy owner of both the Player's Handbook and The Gamemaster's Guide.The books are well-written, the system is easy to understand, while allowing for what makes roleplaying great: Options and possibilities.The system is flexible and fast, and oh, well, it just works OK?In fact, I only took away one star because I have no frame of reference, and didn't want to seem too enthusiastic."
5,Alternity is the best...,"In a world of Rifts, Cyberpunks, Cybergenerations, and Battletechs, this game is by far the very best. It've done a lot of roleplaying in my time and of all of the future-oriented games out there, this one gives you the most room to move and create while still supplying you with a good system to follow. Another TSR success."
3,Old game I passed on,"Loved it...looks to be fun...too many rules ,but can easily ignore the details...unless you are into that...will be running a sci-fi game soon."
1,Secret Weekend Should of Stayed a Secret,"The term ""what might of been"" is the best way to describe this poor Thom Racina novel. Racina gives it a valiant effort, however the whole story is just to hard to believe. All the characters are shallow and unlikeable. The turn of events revolving around why this stalker is obsessed with Audrey Goh, go from strange to almost laughable. The chain of events and leaps of fate made me feel like I was watching some poor thriller movie. This is why I read books, we have seen this story too many times in the theaters.I strongly suggest picking up one of Racina's other novels. As for a sequel to this just let it rest Thom."
2,TRANSLATION,"THIS TRANSLATION FROM THE GERMAN IS ABSOLUTELY AWFUL.BUT THEN, SO IS THE BOOK IN THE ORIGINAL."
5,P!NK GOING BACK TO POP,I love pink I was a bigger fan back in the CANT TAKE ME HOME DAYS but MISSUNDAZTOOD was hot to. I think her single of the CA soundtrack was the best single shes had in awhile. It seems to me shhes heading in a poppier direction again of course the song does have its rock edge. Pink is just fun and this is worth buying I wouldnt pay for the whole album just get this single cause the soundtrack stinks.
5,PINK RULZ!,"Great singer,great song,great video,she is the best female singer in years,i like her R&B and rock style,she is beautiful,I LOVE YOU ALECIA,YOU GOT MY HEART ;)"
1,For a feel good time this is depressing,"For starters she ripped off the melody of Spirit's classic ""Fresh Garbage"", and she sounds so uninspired while singing this I can hardly believe she's promoting a ""Feel Good Time"". I also have issues with this song as it was the last one I heard before my wife had died. That's irrelevant though as I feel Pink's talented she does good on ""Family Portrait"", and ""Who Knew?"" This is just a bad one that's all."
5,Powerful arguments for a more prosperous middle class,A non-fiction page turner! Explains why all this high-tech stuff is FINALLY paying off with a better living for the average American. Deep reporting and great story telling. The community college part is perhaps the reason to be most optomistic about the future of American education.
3,Exciting at the beginning,"I read the 2nd Edition, Revised, of this book and the account of Nevada from 1860 to 1900 was exciting because Nevada was a weird and exciting place during those years. but I did not find the account of 20th century Nevada too interesting, even tho the book devotes full attention to the political history of the state, which I would ordinarily have thought would guarantee my finding this a good book. For a really good state history, read History of North Dakota, by Elwyn B. Robinson. I found that state history (I am not from either Nev. or ND) unputdownable."
4,How to Behave When Eating Out,"If you avoid going to restaurants for fear of your children annoying other diners, this may be the book for you. Read it aloud to young children or let your 2nd and 3rd graders read it for themselves.It covers behavior appropriate for visiting a Restaurant, including respect, politeness, patience, consideration, kindness, neatness, and good manners. It is illustrated with photos. Not the most exciting book, but covers the topic.Some internet sites are included for expanding on the message."
3,"Accurate, but not early","This test did not show a postiive result until 13 DPO for me. Several early detection tests bought at a pharmacy, which I know are more expensive, worked at 11 DPO. So if you want an early result, spend the money. If you can wait, these are just fine."
4,Complementary lessons for Le Petit Prince,"This is the perfect source for outlining vocabulary by page and line. Exercises include vocabulary integration, reading comprehesion questions, written expression in French based on story, grammar,and dictation exercises are also included which offer the student exposure to listening comprehension.The is a wonderful aid for teachers' lesson plans, as it organises class activities based on the chronological order of the story and offers practice of specific functions as the students encounter similiar representations of such in their reading."
2,Wrong item shipped,"The cover on amazon was different than what came in, and i needed the french version, this was english. had to return it."
2,"So that's why Ian used Ballard's Atrocity Exhibition for a song title, he meant this CD!","The late Tony Wilson said Hannett could hear the sounds of the rings around Saturn moving. Maybe so, but all I hear on this is the sound of the bottom of a barrel being scraped, and being such a huge fan of Joy Division, did I jump on it?Yup.Am I feeling really stupid for it?For all but the last few tracks.I'd hardly consider the sounds of elevators being worthy of track listings (unless they're the 13th Floor variety) and the alternate takes are interesting from an historical standpoint, especially if you have to have EVERY bit of Joy Division ephemera, which I do.In the end, if you are a completist, hey, it's cheaper to buy this than to get a life, even on import. If you aren't that deep into the band, stick with the albums or even Permanent. I'm just bitter because I spied a rare Kraftwerk CD after I shelled out for this, that's my own stupidity.Signed,epsteinsmutha"
2,"Awesome system, while the 3-CD unit lasts","The 3-CD unit is flimsy and if it lasts two years without jamming, you are lucky. Still, this system has the best tape transport EVER in a micro player, and plenty of power to fill a LARGE living room. The WOOX feature is amazing.Our CD transport is in the trashbin. The 3rd time it jammed, I had to take the entire unit apart, but still could not fix it *sigh*. The only modern unit which can touch this unit's sound is the LG 160W mini-theater/DVD player, but that unit has no Tape player, let alone recorder."
5,an excellent companion,Professor Cavadini's compilation is an excellent companion to any study of the Western Church fathers. It presents interesting commentary on everything from whether Gregory knew Greek to what he thought of icons.
4,Good Sauce!,"I saw a show about this product. The way it was made, the uses for it and everyone concerned had only good things to say about the company and the product and since I do like the oriental twist, if I may, I decided to buy it. Already used it and the results were very decent and everyone seemed to enjoy my version of Shrimp Lo Mein? (have to learn chinese one of these years) and that is good enough. Tried to shop for it locally but since I reside in an area that shies away from most things of culinary value I had to resort to my good old friend Amazon.com. I see a day not too far off in the future when Amazon might step up and become the reigning champ on the gourmet category. Hopefully when that day arrives they will be the ones selling the products, so us happy Prime Members can rejoice and stop paying 3rd parties fees. A person can dream, that is for sure! 4 Stars for Lee Kum Kee-Premium Oyster Sauce 18 oz (accept no substitutes!)."
2,Lee Kum Kee's Panda Green Label is better,"I love Lee Kum Kee brand but the preservatives and MSG in this one burns my throat a little. So I use their ""Natural"" version: Their Green Label Panda variety without preservatives, MSG and also gluten/wheat free too:Green Label Panda LKK Ingredients: Water, sugar, salt, oyster extractives (oyster, water, salt), modified corn starch, caramel color."
1,Not gluten free,"Since Amazon did not give the list of ingredients, I had to search the web. Found the manufacturer's website [...], and the ingredients are:INGREDIENTS: Oyster Extractives, Sugar, Water, Monosodium Glutamate As A Flavor Enhancer, Salt, Modified Corn Starch, Wheat Flour, Caramel Color.I searched on Amazon for ""gluten free oyster sauce,"" and this one came up. But, as you can see from the ""wheat flour"" it is not true."
2,Awful book !!!,Small business owners may associate themselves with the stories in this book but that is all who should read this book. It is not for general reading. One very shameful point I noticed in this book is the special mention when the business owner was a Jew. He specifically mentions it if not obvious from the name of the business owner (in the case he/she happens to be a Jew). Shame.
4,Business Charisma (Mojo),"Bo writes case studies on a select group of successful Small Giants in America. Taken time to detail what makes these companies and often the founders such a success. He calls it their Mojo, it's the little details that make the difference between their success and just being another business in the crowd. I learned more about some of the companies that I was already familiar with and about new ones that I never heard of. Learning new ways to handle my business, employees, clients and shareholders. In the end the biggest lesson was never lose sight of why you are in business and remember that the business provides the method to achieve that goal."
4,"Refreshing book about companies that you're proud to work with, buy from, and have local","It's excellent to see that it's possible for companies - often lambasted as ""evil"" - act as a force for good within their community and for their employees while still turning a tidy profit. This book should reassure anyone thinking that they need to either take the low road to ensure continued growth or that they have to become a volunteer to provide meaningful contributions to the world that there is a path through business to do so. That path just might not involve creating a huge, public, multi-national corporation."
5,Tired of corporate ladder climbing?,"A must read for execs in small and medium sized business. If you've always had a sneaking suspicion that you shouldn't have to sacrifice your personal values for corporate politics and the almighty dollar, this book will cement your thoughts with specific examples of what to focus on instead. But don't be misdirected by the title. These companies make a handsome profit. In fact, their strategies, choices and values are precisely the differentiators that continue to make these entities viable and profitable in the long run. Burlingham's writing style is easily readable and the real world examples are engaging."
5,Company Culture Done Right,"If you have any sway in your company's approach to how it treats customers, its employees, and its vendors, read this to learn how your company can be successful AND a great place to work at the same time."
4,"Good book, a bit too long","The book itself is a very interesting one - it explores some other perspective on companies rather than just growth rate, IPO price or smth else. However, sometimes it gets quite boring - the author makes his point and then talks about it for too long. But anyway, worth reading!"
5,Have a knitting question?,It answered my knitting questions. Dislike: nothing. Anyone beginning to knit or possibly seeking an answer to a method for a stitch.
5,After searching......,"After searching for this book for so long, I was delighted to see it listed on Amazon. It arrived in excellent condition and record time. Since it was ordered during the 'Holiday' rush, I was totally surprised to receive it so quickly. The quality and customer service can not be beat! Very happy with the purchase!!!"
2,Another 'pretty' book,I was so anxious to read this book and I was shocked by how many typo-s I found here. It was very carelessly edited. For $40 I expected more. A disappointment
4,Soap Caddy,My husband has been using a soap caddy like this for years. He got it at a KOA over 30 years ago and it finally broke apart. I looked all over for a replacement and found this on the internet and it is exactly like the other one. It will serve him for years to come. I'm glad someone still makes them. It was delivered on time but the delivery charge will 150% more than the product which I wasn't too happy about. I think it could have been mailed at a cheaper rate.
2,A Silverberg Disappointment,"Robert Silverberg is a remarkably talented, prolific writer, I'll grant him that. However, in this book, which he edited way back in 1977, he chose nine stories dealing -- some marginally --with time travel and, to be honest, I only found two or three of the stories that interesting. It's a matter of taste, folks, and although I'm a fan of time-travel stories, this book was not to my taste."
2,Waste of a Good Idea,"Although James Herbert's imagination is obviously a vivid one, his writing skills are second rate at best. I fail to see how he has gotten this far in his career with his blatant disregard for good storytelling.The basic idea of '48(a plague released by Hitler after WW2 kills off almost everybody except our intrepid hero and a few others) is scary enough to impress, but it loses its impact when coupled with Herbert's stilted prose."
2,The Gore of Sleath,"Here's the run down: You've got a emotionally compromised psychic investigator who has been sent to an intellectually compromised town. He's heard creepy stuff has been happening and he's a scientist sent to do his thing. He does everything but behave like one however.To give him credit, 'ol Herb the author did have some suspense going. But as I was turning the pages, I was grimacing to find out what was next. There was an exceedingly large portion of icky violent scenes. And by ick, I mean things being ripped off, oozing down, cracking apart etc etc... Another con, would be the psychic-link romance quotient... Yeah, who'd a thought."
1,Prurient self indulgence,"I agree with the review on 13th February. There is a line between good descriptive horror writing and dwelling on the obscene sick details of a scene. Herbert crosses this line. I found the descriptive prose in this book to be overlong to the point of tedious. The tension builds and builds......and builds......and builds and then it just goes away, leaving this reader tired and bored."
2,"A Disapointment, like everything else of his I've read...","I had to read this book as well as ""The Haunted"" after watching the movie on which, both novels are evidently based. I'm often amazed when a movie is better than the books. And in this case the movie was far superior! In writing, in plot, and pacing, the movie outstrips the books in a way that the author probably finds offensive.Do not waste precious time on these novels, rent the movie instead. If you must read a suspense novel, particularly a british one, read a great one! I recommend anything by Phil Rickman who is phenomenal to say the very least."
1,This book was a complete waste of money.,"Paper thin characters and mindless action fill this waste of paper and ink. The only character I cared about at all was the American's adopted mut. The whole premise of the book was flawed - I am sure that even in 1948 everyone knew what would happen if an incompatiable blood transfusion was attempted. Stupid, Stupid, Stupid..."
1,Disappointing,"I felt that this book was by far Herbert's poorest effort yet. In general, I have enjoyed his books in the past, but this one was just plain boring."
2,Good Research Isn't Enough,"Herbert gets an extra star because he clearly spent a lot of time researching war time London. However, the good research wasn't nearly enough to save this novel. The premise of the book is that at the end of the second world war, the nazis released some kind of virus that wiped out most of the world population rather than admitting defeat. The problems are as follows:1. He used a noir-ish tone for his characters, but it wasn't well done and instead of stylish, it just came across as badly written.2. The constant action scenes were better suited to a bad film than a bad novel.3. The characters were cardboard cut-outs, and their actions in relation to each other made very little sense at all.Total summation: Skip this one."
1,"A GREAT idea, but...","Now, to me, there can be nothing cooler than the premise of this book. A few survivors of a world destroying disease fight off all sorts of dangers, including slow dying ""Brownshirts"" and the elements of destroyed London. The team mix is dripping with interesting potential in the way of plot twists and turns, however that goes nowhere. In fact, the whole book goes nowhere. The writing is so poor. And the plot is so good, but destroyed. Read the book if you don't believe me. I wish I had come up with the idea myself so I could've done this plot justice. Mr. Herbert had such a great idea and just let it slip away. Tsk, tsk..."
1,"Idea Great, Execution Not","Herbert really shot himself in the foot with this one. A fantastic premise ruined by boring characters, silly sub-plots, and inane observations.This book feels like something turned in to fulfill a contract. There is a chase scene that goes on....and on.....and on.....for something like 100 pages. And rather than creating supense, or concern for the characters dangerous predicament, you just wish they'd die and leave you alone.I won't ruin the plot for you, but just let me say that it's been a long time since I've read a book with so many inconsistencies and absurd solutions, not to mention the repeated use of 'deus ex machina' to save the day.If you worship at the shrine of premise, this may be worth a read. If you also need characters to care about, or even tolerate, give it a pass."
3,Not quite Herbert's best,"Unfortunately Herbert somehow fails to capture the imagination in The Ghosts of Sleath as much as he does in most of his other books. The story centres around psychic investigator, David Ash, who delves into mysterious events that are terrorizing the community of Sleath, where he comes across a dark character called Phelan. Though the premise of the book is sound, and though there are solid descriptions, somehow Herbert doesn't quite capture the imagination. Maybe it's that word `solid' that gives the clue.None of Herbert's books could be called weak, and I'd like to give this one three-and-a-half stars, but The Ghosts of Sleath doesn't quite come up to the spendid page-gripping terror that this author is well capable of. Don't let that put you off either this book or James Herbert, because it's still darn good reading."
3,48?,48 is a good book. If you want a fast read.Trips along ok but does'nt really lead anywhere.Hero wins again! Should really have been written by an American.
2,A New Herbert,"Unfortunately I was disappointed with this offering from the man who gave us classics such as ""The Rats"" and ""The Survivor"". The idea for the plot is not the most original ever concieved but still reasonably chilling. The descriptions of London were vivid and enjoyable but page after page of Sten clutching action became a little much. I would have also liked to discover a little more about the characters other than Hoke. At times they felt a little like five names running around London. Herbert terrified me with ""The Dark"" but this was not even close to being in the same class."
4,Hold your nose and dive in,"As self-help, the book argues most depression stems from emotional immaturity, a refreshing thesis. Hankin says many depressed need to grow up rather than self-medicate -- act rather than freeze in self-pity, self-castigation and blaming others. Her notion of pseudoreality, the world created through reliance on feelings, hit close to home for me.But as a book it can be condescending and sappy. The end-of-chapter mantras, ""Let us be frank, let us be clear,"" indicate Hankin needed an editor to dissuade her from rhetorical tricks. She has serious insights into the neuroses inspired by self-pity, especially how victimhood is self-centered, but she makes diagrams of them with hands and decks of cards."
5,Negative reviews are from lazy people,"who prefer to believe that we cannot control how we live.If you are happy being on meds and feeling sorry for yourself, then of course you will feel skeptical about the advice in this book. If you are ready to get off your ass and take responsibility for yourself and how you handle things, then this book is life-changing."
4,Pretty Good,"I enjoyed reading the stories of each of the enterpreneurs featured, I wish it had even more stories. I was expecting to be a little more inspired by the book though, but perhaps I just didn't give it enough time to sink in since I've been reading other books at the same time. It's nice to have a book around that is such a quick read - so you can remind yourself of the ideas in it. I will reread it again."
5,"Good Product, Good Company...","I highly recommend both this product and the company. I've used the Professor Teaches series as part of my adult computer familiarization classes for the past two years with great success. If you are just starting out or want to learn a few new things, Professor Teaches is the way to go."
2,professor fails to teach,"The idea of such a program is good. The programs fails miserably. If you have never touched a computer you may get some really basic intruction, therefore I have generously awarded two stars. The problem is with the funtioning of the course. At least half of the exercises do not work for either the correct nor incorrect responses. If the progrtams were cleaned up, it might be a worthwhile tool, but as it is now don't waste your money. Get an instruction book."
5,Let's hear more...,"I really enjoyed this book, the characters were very believable and the story unfolded in a way that left me wanting to know what happened to many of the people after the book ended.I really enjoyed the photos too, Portugal is apparently a beautiful country.I hope another book by these authors is available soon."
5,The only introduction you'll ever need!,"The current chief of the Order of Bards Ovates & Druids, the world's largest druid order today, presents a concise and easy-to-read introduction and history of what has become modern druidry. There are no attempts to pretensiously link the current movement with the ancient past and the author portrays a likely evolution of the celtic priesthood without resorting to so-called secret texts, lost documents, or wild speculations -- just the facts as known. This work also discusses the three grades within modern druidry, providing a reasonable description of how each functioned, and then compares the current thread with other neo-pagan movements emerging in the second half of the 20th century, such as Wicca. Above all it dispells the myths written mainly by the Romans over the past two millennia. For the open-minded. Read it and see!"
4,A Book Journal Best for Those in Reading Groups,"This is a small spiral-bound journal divided up into the following sections: Book Register, Books to Read, Reading Group Notes, Book Stores and Services and Passages. It is nice that it is spiral-bound because it opens up flat. I found it somewhat limiting, however, because not everyone who journals is in a book group.Each page is set up for a different review and is organized by title, author, date published, dates read, notes, recommended or lent to, and rating. The beginning of each section has a literary quote.I have not chosen to use this particular journal because it does not meet my needs. I think, however, that it would be a good choice for anyone in a book group."
2,fair at best,"i was hoping for a journal that would be good for a bookclub. this one has too many entry areas that are similar and one that is useless (a big section for bookstore addesses...) it's probably great if you like to explore old bookstores while on vacation and you want to keep track of what you've read. for a book club, it's adequate if you change around some of the 'chapters'."
4,Alright.,"I remember watching this,it was an alright Pay-Per-view.My main match's#1.Shawn Michaels vs. The undertaker.Great match,great ending,but could not top Wrestlemania 25 match.I mean i was happy these two icon's where gonna fight.But i think i would have been more happy,if this match didn't take place.And Shawn would of Quit at Wresltmania's 25th one.Now that does not mean the match was not good,i just mean they should have had left it alone.#2 Bret vs. VinceDon't even get me started on that wast of time,and money.#3 Chris Jericho vs. EdgeGreat match,i would have wanted edge to win.But he didn't.#4. John Cena vs.Batista...........Alright,Well let just say Alright.All in All,for this price i would buy it,anymore i would say no."
3,WWE WM 26,"The best match on the card was HBK-UnderTaker.The worst matches were the Bret Hart-McMahon which was awful & very disappointing as a Ed Wood film and the 10-Diva tag team match which was thoughtless,totally botch-ridden & just as bad as WWE's Raw Bowl back in 1996.The Unified WWE Tag Team Champioship match while a solid match it was also uninspiring.The 10 way Money In The Bank Ladder Match was very cluttered & almost as cluttered as the 40 man battle royal they had back in 1992.The rest were ok.I give this event a 7 and a half out of 10."
5,Wrestlemania 26,Not long enough. Left out Mad dog Vachon at the Hall of Fame and Wendy Williams and the Hart Foundation. Just a few words. Why not the whole ceremony. They deserved it.Matches were good but not the best wrestle mania.
5,Used Dvd,i bought the used version of the dvd and it played alot better than i couldve hoped it would d
4,Bought this for my son,"I bought this for my son, aged 12, for Christmas and he liked it. He gave it 4 stars out of 5 and said it was good. He has watched it all and enjoyed talking about it with his younger brother. (I have not watched it!)"
5,WRESTLEMANIA 26 is an awesome buy for wrestling fans,"It's WRESTLEMANIA who wouldn't be a fan of this!!!! All of the matches were very good and exciting, if I had to suggest one match on the whole DVD it would be Shawn Michaels vs Undertaker match. IF you are a major wrestling fan than you should definitely pick up this 3 disc collectors edition, it is most definitely worth the price."
3,The Cubs,The movie is good but I wonder why the name change for the home team went from the Cubs to the Bruins? In the stage play the Cubs remain Cubs. The movie was filmed at Wrigley Field so the Cubs had to cooporate with the project.
4,Kinda big and what't the deal with the microphone,"My three year old is enjoying the helmet but it seems overly large. I'm 6' 220 lbs and can wear the hat comfortably, on him its really big. The microphone boom is not necessary and is an annoyance. We cut it out with a seam ripper and it worked well. Visibility is good with the hemet and the padding on the top is welcome.In short it's fun, but the educational value eludes me."
4,"Solid Book, but with MBCA Focus","I write mainly to note that the book focuses almost exclusively on the Model Business Corporation Act, with only occasional references to Deleware or other state law. If your course has a similar focus, then this is a solid book that progresses well and lets you test you knowledge along the way. But if your class, like mine, focuses mainly on Deleware law, this book will prove significantly less useful. The book will often state something generic like, Some states allow X and others do not. But it rarely specifies which states have adopted which approach."
5,Elizabeth yellow Magnolia,"I planted an Elizabeth Magnolia behind my house about 12 years ago. It grew into a beautiful tree. The yellow flowers are great. I have done nothing to care for it. It's about 2 stories high. I have bought many trees and shrubs from on-line and local nurseries. This was one of my best purchases.The instructions said to plant it in a sheltered location to protect it from wind, which I did.I bought it by mail order from Wayside Gardens, which no longer sells it. I have no experience with Clifton's Nursery."
5,The flirty curves collection rocks!,"I wear a size 32c bra, which is nearly impossible to find. These bras are so comfy, and they somehow provide excellent support with minimal padding. If only they made more styles!"
1,Poor quality,"ASIN:B000HCYPBQ WOLF GARTEN Deluxe Garden Tote]]I ordered two totes, one for daughter and one for me. I did not care for the ""plastic"" feel of the fabric. One of the totes had a small hole in the bag and I felt that it would not hold up when using it to carry my soil knife and garden scissors. I opened the 2nd tote and noticed that it had WOLF GARTEN tags sewn on the top band...the first bag did not have any tags. One of the labels was sewn upside down. Maybe a petty observation, but to me, it indicated a lack of quality control. Basically, I did not care for the ""made in China"" bag, offered by a German company that makes garden tools. I returned both of the totes."
3,Mesh Bag,"Okay, Pockets not as deep as I thought nor do they expand as wide. Some of the stitching was borderline. Like the mesh pockets though."
5,A feeling I havent felt in a long time,This cd brought back alot of memories for me and I absolutely loved it. Especially track number one. There are songs for the worshiper and the praisers. You should invest in it.
2,Could have been SO much better,"What a wonderful and scary premise for a book. However, the writing is really atrocious. Punctuation errors abound. The first half of the book is mostly interminable, boring, non-sensical conversation, which jumps around from subject to subject or is repetitive. In the hands of a better writer, this could have been a great book. As interested as I was in the story and the outcome, I found my mind wondering, unable to even remember what it was that I just read."
1,Unimpressed,While the sociology history in the first few chapters was interesting this book became unorganized and the last 25% of the book was related to dating and sex.If you're looking for etiquette and chivalric codes of conduct look elsewhere.
2,Don't know that these work,Have only used for 2 months but so far both times have not had luck with a positive test. Had used tests from the dollar store before and they did work but then decided to try these and did not like them.
1,"Worthless, waste of time","I used these strips for 4 months like clockwork every 24 hours. I never got a positive result. Month 3 we started trying to get pregnant, month 4 we got pregnant. These strips were discouraging and did not help me learn my cycle timing. Stick to a thermometer!"
2,50 ovulation test... Update,These are definitely better than the ones you can buy in stores. I get a clear positive OPK everytime I'm about to ovulate. (No half + line)UPDATE: this product depends on who you buy it from so buyer beware...Another Update: So I recently purchase these again(from the right seller). The first time around they were great I got a nice solid + OPK. This time around not so great :( They were very disappointing. I got half + OPK's so unsure if they were although my BBT has gone up so I'm guessing they were. I guess I talked to soon before :( I don't know if they are different from the last time either way I am not buying them anymore.
4,Actually Pretty Good,"I have read books and watched videos from this author before and thought they were just so so. This book, however, is good from the standpoint of including the history of wild parrots and how this effects our companion birds. I was luky enough to get it when the cost was lowered for a while. You will not waste your time or money if you get this book."
4,xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXX xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI do not want to rate this at this time. I would like the option to comment if I feel strongly about it one way or the other.
4,Helpful advice and perspective,"This is one of the best books I have read on parrot care and training. It was especially helpful because I have a ""second-hand"" parrot who was coerced into stepping up and as a result is very aggressive with hands. I found it helpful that she addressed this particular problem. I also liked that she gave references and examples of training. I would have liked step by step instructions or details for example Barbara Heidenreich said she worked 20 minutes each day for two weeks to train a bird and I was curious to know what she did each day for 20 minutes and how she began and ended those sessions. Maybe she will write another book where I can learn more. I also liked her philosophy of building a relationship with the bird rather than trying to dominate the bird. Thank you for this book."
5,Good for fundamental understanding,"Presented from a somewhat different perspective than I was taught at Dartmouth (Maciejowski jumps right into modeling of simple systems, rather than building from a mathematical foundation), but, because of that, is quite good for developing a fundamental understanding of just what is being accomplished in predictive control."
4,Big Curve,"Like other Global products the G-13 Curved Carving Fork looks wonderful. But be careful, it has a bigger curve than the pictures show. The curve is so big that the fork does not fit in my knife block. There should be a picture from the side so that buyers can see how big the curve really is. I have used it on a couple of roasts and it works great."
2,Overpriced,I found the 5th Edition to be overpriced. The 4th edition offered the same information and much cheaper!
2,hard book,THis book is extremly detailed and the words are written in a tightly compacted format.THe book gives you too much information to absorb within each chapter
3,Mostly recycled,"This second album by Ghost Machine really reminds me of their first one, probably because nearly half the songs are the same! They also use those little artsy moments of silence again, which I find annoying. That's not a big deal, but rehashing so many of the songs definitely is. Some of the repeats are listed in the contents while others appear in the ""hidden"" tracks, which is another trick I dislike. I really like Ghost Machine and feel disappointed that they didn't come up with all new material for this release. Do I feel ripped off? Yeah, kinda. Would I have bought it had I known about all the duplicate songs? Probably not."
3,So long ago,"I don't remember this book very well, hum, seems like it had some helpful information. Guess I better go hunt it down."
5,The absolute BEST book on getting a product to market!!!,This is without a doubt the best book out there on how to get your product ideas out in the market place. I've read this book twice and refer to it constantly and I swear every time I refer to it I learn something new. I have tons of books on bringing products to market but none of them offer the amount of wisdom that this book does. Although the title may sound complicated the book is essentially about how to find suppliers for your products and retailers to carry them with you acting as the importer. EXCELLENT BOOK! Also the author has a very helpful Yahoogroup set up for discussing the book topics. After reading the book you can even email the author directly and he is very good about answering questions. Best money I've ever spent!!!
1,Very Old Information,"This book is so out of date it is almost funny. But not quite. The author may be well intentioned, but if he wants to keep the public's respect, he should get this off the market until it is completely revised. Completely."
1,Obsolete Info.,"This book is pre-TSA and does not deal with the risk now present from the drastic changes in our government workings.Unless this book is updated with valid information reflecting the changes of the last decade, save yourself $25."
5,Bring your innovative product to market,"Other books dealing with startup/product introduction merely outline the various possibilities and options, leaving one with many questions. John Spiers explains exactly what to do and what not to do."
2,outdated information,this book is published in 2001 and the latest good review of it is in 2006. Wish I have considered these before i got it.
3,"Sure, but it does not help...","I'm still a half-wit. I mean it provided plenty of big words and concepts that I never heard of before. I was expecting a book that you opened up and was just money. Do they have that book? I would so buy that. Well, I mean unless it cost more to buy the book than was printed inside of it.Any way, it was kinda interesting."
1,So bad... it's hilarious,I love B's 9th! Karajan and Abaddo do a bang up job. Roger Norrington? His version makes me think of Gilligan's Island. It is so bad... it's funny!
1,Crazy tempos!,"I only bought this set's #1/#3; thank goodness. Despite a few tries, I fell asleep listening to the CD each time. Sounded like an orchestra playing instruments, but I wasn't sure Norrington was conducting Beethoven's symphonies. '1 star' is generous; I would've given it '0 star' if available. Crazy tempos, listless playing, it isn't about Beethoven, rather it's Norrington having some kind of an ax to grind."
4,Not as good as my Panasonic CT34WX50,"Major drawbacks on this product (versus the Panasonic widescreen 34 inch, CT34WX50, which I also own) include 1) When switched on, the television defaults to ""WIDE"" viewing mode, which is fine for anamorhphic DVDs but is not appropriate for watching any other source, where ""PANORAMA"" OR ""ZOOM"" are better choices. The previous viewing mode choice is not saved once the TV is switched off. 2) There is no ""AUTO"" mode, where the TV automatically adjusts the aspect ratio as different programs alternate between widescreen and 4:3 formats. 3)There is no leeway to fine tune the aspect ratio in ZOOM or WIDE formats.The picture quality itself is beautiful, particularly in HDTV and EDTV (DVD source)."
1,Film is a Travesty,"2/3 of film is ""Background and fluff"". Bundy's Activities in Wash, Utah, Colo and one in Fla are omitted--the core of the story. Scene with cop in desert never occurred as shown. Didn't even get the color of his VW right. At least 85% fiction. Bad film, and terrible attention to detail. Huge disappointment"
1,About this Bundy movie...,"I have seen two other movies on Bundy and This is the bottom of the barrel,a really lousy version. Save your money,thats all folks"
2,Quite Disappointing,"I have been a Rod McKuen follower since the 1970s and miss some of my early LPs that were unfortunately stolen years ago. So I ordered this CD in good faith but when I played it was amazed to hear that the sound and tempo of the songs (in my mind based from hearing them years ago) was faster, possibly to fit all the selections on one CD (I don't know). End product is a sound that is NOT romantic OR mood setting, not peaceful, rather racing through the selections to the point of annoyance. Save your money up to buy older and in good condition copies of the originals, like I am doing."
3,A teen crush,"Way, way, back I thought Rod McKuen was ""all that."" I knew he was gay, but I loved his poems & songs. I bought his books & LP's & loved his outlook. Over the years, they've all been lost, so when I saw his older, weathered face, it brought back nice memories. I'll probably not buy another, but I'm enjoying this one."
4,Great traps,"Not the stickiest traps I've ever seen or used, but was exactly what I needed. I also loved the price for the number of traps."
1,Shipping problem,I ordered this downpipe exhaust more then a week ago. The product still hasn't been shipped and promised 19-22. Today is the 19th why even promise a time of delivery.
1,Desperation Blvd. - do you like B- movies?,"I love Judy Tenuta, and she is pretty good in this movie. There are cameos by two of my other favorite comedians, ""Weird Al"" Yankovic and Emo Phillips. All this made me want to see this movie very much, and I even read some good reviews of it somewhere. It seemed the only way I was going to see it was to buy it - so I did. Well, I had my curiosity satisfied but that is all. The plot idea is a good one, and the editing of the trailer makes it look pretty clever. The editing of the film, however, leaves much to be desired. Every scene seems to drag. They draw everything out trying to make this into a feature length film. There are a small handful of great moments - they last seconds. But the rest of the film is tiresome. I really wanted to like this movie but I can't recommend it."
1,Boringgggggg,This book took over a week for me to read. It was boring from start and gained 1 star for the ending. I can't believe I bought the sequel at the same time I bought this one. It had tooo many sex scenes and they got more and more boring. I have a good sex life and didn't need to read that many fantasies throughout a book.
2,"""Hold the sex,But add some story please!""","I really thought that I was going to enjoy this book,But it started off too slow and was boring at times.If the author would have focused more on the actual plot instead of so many sex scenes,then maybe it would have turned out better.Majority of the secrets was really predictable and I wasnt too impressed by the ending..This book was all over the place and lacked substance.I basically had to force myself through it.Will not be reading the sequel,would rather have someone tell me what happened."
1,Without Substance,"The book started promising-an affair, a lot of sex, a ""secret"". The writing was all over the place. There were countless mistakes that the editors did not catch and the over all voice seemed too forced. It seemed more like the author was trying to find as many different ways as he could to describe sex. Even that got old after a while. I didn't like how it jumped towards the end with the son getting hurt and how all of the sudden he was in the hospital ready to die. The author could have done so much with that, but that lack of description and the whole lead was completely off. I won't bother to read a sequel."
1,This book sucked!!,"What was the big secret of a housewife..... Not a Damn thing. This book was full of sex, and it was just all over the place. I don't think I want to read the sequel."
3,The Secrets that we keep!!,"I think this book was an alright read the author made a shallow attempt of making us think that this was a big scandal when the story was so predictable. I just thought the book could have been a little better put together, even the names of the women were corny Secret and Victoria you should have not named the women after a Lingerie Store. I wanted to give the book two and a half stars but I gave the extra point for nice try."
5,OMG!,"Tarron is one arrogant, selfish s.o.b. I found myself repulsed by the decisions he made at the expense of his family. Secret, while wearing a mask of innocence and woe is me, is just as guilty since she's also getting her groove on. Secret's name is befitting since she has more of them than the law should allow. Everyone in this book is doing dirt except the kids which makes it that much more exciting.This book was full of surprises and keep you interested as the drama unfolded all around you. I love the way J. Tremble builds the story and escalate it at the right times without rushing it or making it seems as if it's an afterthought."
3,Plenty Of Secrets,"This was a ok read I liked J. Tremble's other books moreBut, ok read. Secret has secrets of her own that took way to long to come out but, I kind of predicted what they was.Tarron have more of a connection with his mistress Victoria which has plans of her own in the meantime.Secret, secrets is alot when it comes to her husband but, after Tarron wanting to leave her she still feel she loves him and want to be with him.Again a ok read."
1,"if the rating provided a ""zero 0"" I would have used it.","Do not purchase. This product is defective in its entirety. I have two or three sets of Wine, Highball etc. Some are in my northern michigan home with no ""dishwasher"", other than me, a possible reason why they survive. The ones recently purchased for use at my residence that has a dishwasher (other than me)disintegrated leaking wine etc through cracks. I assumed they had been abused somehow. But I watched their use in the next few weeks and then two more went bad in the same manner. This product is not designed defectively it is produced with defective or inappropriate materials. READ the comments on the recommendations below the product now, other than mine. Take this product out of your listings. DMH"
1,Unbreakable.....not,We purchased 2 sets of these. We have only one left that has not started leaking. They may last if you only handwash. I would definitely not purchase these again.
5,Leaning On Ever Lasting Arm - Touches One's Spirit,"Rev. Timothy Wright's music is extremely uplifting. I can't sit still when listening to it. I always think of my grandmother and other family members who have long passed away. His music just touches the soul. I eagerly await every new CD he records. This man and his music is truly touched, especially ""Leaning On Everlasting Arm."""
3,Wrist weights are okay,These wrist weights are meant for someone with large wrists or someone who doesn't mind the weights sitting half way down one's forearms.
2,Philiips FWC399,"not a good buy, i mean just look at the speakers, they're different. look for something sony made."
1,Big Fat Disapointedmint,"Absolutely disapointed wi this wan so I wiz. HAd none a the classics like THE DAY A GOT 2 GIROS or the classic SITTING WI GAZZA IN THE MADHOOSE. A canny understand how they missed oot other nuggets like MY MAW, MY SISTER (ONE IN THE SAME), FAT AUNTIE SALLY, TWO ANDY GURAMS, DRINKING SOOPER ALE IN A GUTTER, DOON THE PRIMARY WI RICHARD GOUGH, and my favourite IBROX STANDS CAME FALLIN' DOON. I would recomment that you dont buy this wan, but instead go for that new Donal Finley & the Fat Mason's CD: ""ALKY SONGS FOR BIGOTS"" its a pure belter. Am aff to smight the dug, peace oot fellow bares."
4,Mojo Club V.4 Is a Keeper,"Mojo Club V.4: Light My FireThe songs range from good to great. I like more than half of them enough to upload them into my personal favorites collection. A couple of the songs (""Light My Fire and ""Hit or Miss""), I like about as well as anything I've ever heard. The sound engineering is outstanding. The music is more detailed, warm, and ""alive"" than on most CDs. This CD sounds almost as good as an LP."
4,More Latin-Jazz-Soul-Lounge from the Mojo series,"Lots of fun, hard to find tracks. More vocally-oriented than some in the series.01 Light My Fire Shirley Bassey02 Zazueira Elis Regina03 Jimmy Jean Ellen McIlwaine04 Dyambo Hugh Masekela05 Hummin' Roy Ayers06 Hit Or Miss Odetta07 Transmazonica Tania Maria08 Oba, Lá Vem Ela Jorge Ben09 Give Me Some Of That Good Old Love Willie Hutch10 Sweet Darling Think It Over Junior Wells11 Hold Out Your Hand Karin Krog12 Balanca Pema Ronaldo Mesquita13 Pai Baden Powell14 Sunny James Brown, Dee Felice Trio15 Return Of The Prodigal Son Joe Lee Wilson16 Use It Or Lose It Gotham17 Pretty Brown Skin Edwin Birdsong18 Easin' In Edwin Starr19 Try To Relax Ballin' Jack"
5,Best Book Ever,This has to be my favorite book out of the christy miller and sierria jensen series. The more you read in either of the series the closer you get to the people in them. To me it is though I know them in person. I know Robin is only planing on writting two more books but I hope she will write many many more!!!!
5,Ahhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Oh My word! This was the best book i've read in a long time!!!! Such a well written novel, i suggest it to girls 13 and up. Five stars!"
5,Really Entertaining!,This is a great book. I really enjoyed it. Just the type of book you could curl up with and feel uplifted inside and out. Very Quaint and romantic in this modern world. I loved it and I am definitely looking forward to the next 2 in the series. This is the kind of book I would buy and reread again and again.
5,An Awesome Book!,"I have followed all of Miss Gunns youth books. This book starts the summer before the last Sierra book ended. It is about Christy, Todd, and Katies adventures through Europe. I've missed Christy and Todd for the past couple of years as I've read about Sierra. We are dumped into a great new side of them. They are becoming adults! It has been so cool seeing Christy's life over the past 6 years. I cannot wait to see he finish college!"
5,"big hair's gone, but the voice is BACK","Went to her show in NY last night - she's lost the big hair and looked very chic. Excellent show, and hearing the new numbers immediately made me buy the album for myself and for friends. Right up there with her first album, she is back."
3,Love the last few tracks,I like Macy's music to dance to while driving or riding my bike. Only the last few will do. They are great. The rest are only ok.
2,Not so Great,"Not as good as her other previous albums. Too slow, not as funky, a little too mainstream."
2,How are we doing?,"Girl, I dug your first two records, but you've moved on and so have I. You used to be a freak and now you just want to cuddle. F*** it."
3,Slightly off from her last one...,"...and i haven't spent too much time with it, but i only give it three stars at this point"
1,if her voice had a face............,"it would scare the heck out of medusa.i am extremely curious as to who her fans think sounds awful.judging by them rating ms dylan waits so highly,they must own a dozen william hung cds."
2,meh,"I own this sword, two actually. It's really cool, the skulls are rockin, and its longer than I initially expected and a bit heavy to use effectively with one hand. The sheaths are fantastic, way better than those cheap fake leather ones. It's a great sword for show, but is NOT in any way combat ready. I knew the limitations of this sword when I bought mine, so this is more just a warning for new sword buyers. In order for a sword to be truly combat ready (ie you can hit it against other swords, branches, etc) the sword needs to be full tang (meaning the blade is one solid piece of steel and runs the length of the handle and is secured normally by 1-3 pins. Avoid ""rat-tail tang"" because they snap easily. Now this won't apply to probably 99% of people looking at this sword, but if you know how to weld, the handle is steel so you can weld the blade to the handle, and if you do so effectively these swords are ""battle ready"""
1,good but bent,first off my sword came with a bent tip second my sheathe was not well very reliable due to fact the sword cut through the end but for the price im happy with the product i just had to sharpen and unbend it but now she shreds watermelons like its cutting threw butter nice weight to the weapon although a but heavy on the handle side probably due to the big metal skull at the end but im not complaining
2,Super sweet tasting,"This isn't very good because they put too much sugar in it. The first ingredient on the flavor packet is sugar. If they cut back on it, increase some chunks I'd buy it again. The spiciness is perfect. Not too much but just enough to taste it.Comes with a fork, not sure why. I like that it's vegan and gluten free."
5,Intoxicating Perfection,"A big THANK YOU to all you reviewers for sharing your positive comments about this gem of a CD, because I wouldn't have wanted to pay $49.00 for it had I not had your assurances that it was worth the extra money. And, yes, it IS worth every penny--and much more. I received the CD 3 days ago and have been playing it over and over. The performance and the arrangement are so refreshing and intoxicating that I've been taking the CD everywhere with me--so I can play it in the car and in the office. (How could your heart not melt when listening to ""Some Things Happen""?) As soon as I receive a few other Boz Scaggs CDs released post Middle Man, I will take a long drive in my new car. Life is good when Boz is back in it after all these years."
5,"If you're a true fan of the Slow Dancer, you need this disk.","A friend purchased this for me as a gift. I had just seen Boz on his ""Come on Home"" tour in Summer of '97. The acoustic treatments of ""Lowdown"", ""Harbor Lights"", and ""We're All Alone"" would be enough to make this disk a ""must"" on their own. But when you add the new studio tracks ""Fade Into Light"", and ""Some Things Happen"" you just know you've discovered a rare gem. ""Sierra"" is added for extra measure. Enjoy it."
2,works but picthure is good shape.,i would not buy it or depend on it again pictures are always dark even in sunlight you have to have the sunlight right in your face to get a good picture. the only way to get a good picture at night is the take 2 500 watt light bulbs and shine it on what you want to take a picture of. it takes to much light to take a picture.
2,This Camera is not worth using even if you get it for FREE,"I bought this camera thinking that it would be nice to have a little pocket-sized camera to carry around for spontaneous picture taking. I was expecting the photos to be low resolution and low quality considering the price and size of the camera. The quality of the photos was even worse than expected. They are so poor I can't imagine how you would be able to use them for any purpose. I also found that the battery life is too short and the image viewfinder doesn't match the actual image taken requiring you to mentally compensate. The worst offense, however, is that the software that comes with the unit is pathetic. There is also zero support for the camera on the Phillips web page. I recommend staying away from this camera."
2,No mac support,"Feh. This is one of the only cameras in the world that only works with Windows, not Macintosh."
1,Will it work? Highly Doubtful,This is a complete piece of crap. I could've used those $25 on Starbucks. My daughter got one of these as a Christmas gift. We are now reaching Valentines Day. We have NOT be able to get the darn drivers to load. There is no support from Phillips and the install cd that came with it won't load the drivers. If you are running XP run away cause there is no way you're gonna be able to get this to work with your operating system. I've been trying to find ANY drivers that will work with this but no such luck.
4,Great for preteens,"My 11-year-old daughter has been having a lot of fun with this. The view through the viewfinder is a little ""off"" that of the picture, but we were easily able to adapt. It's perfect for a webcam or for emailing pictures. And I'm not stuck paying money to get a bunch of nonsense pictures developed, nor do I stress about the camera getting lost--it wasn't that expensive. I'll have to get a couple for gifts."
2,ok for price....,"I bought this earlier this day, and i'm already disappointed. The software is fairly cheasy, even the best quality is very grainy, it chews up the battery, and it has the smallest amount of memory. 2 MB. Most keychain cameras have 8MB. I'm not even going to try it on low res mode, especially after i saw high res. It wont let me take video. and, there is no way to add memory (most can). I'm taking it back asap, and am going to by the better quality Vistaquest camera. I'm just happy i didn't buy the Digital Concepts camera, for it supposedly doesn't work at all."
3,Decent Gift for Preteens,"I just bought this little gem for my niece this Christmas (2005).* Pro: She loves it, especially, the not-too-bad webcam feature.* Con: For the price, can't really complain about the quality of images. The software interface could be better.* Question: ""How do I...?"" After taking up 20 photos and filling up the internal memory, NEITHER SHE NOR I CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO DELETE or FLUSH the memory in order to take new photos! She lost the manual (if there was any). Downloading the pics to the PC does not reset the memory either.. Please HELP, anybody... :-)"
1,do not buy this garbage,"This camera nevers take a picture of what you see through the viewfinder. Moreover, the picture through the viewfinder is soo small you can hardly see anything. The software was impossilbe to load in Windows ME but loaded after several tries in windows XP. You need a magnifying glass to read the driections. Do waste your money. This product does not work."
2,Good for some kids,"I normally use a Pentax K1000 film camera, but my son gave me a Philips Keychain camerea to take apart and experiment with. Instead, I started using it because there is no cost to taking a picture.I found that the other comments were probably accurate, but ommitted that if the subject is within 10 feet, or so, the picture is probably not too bad. I have had poor results with white subjects in bright sunlight.The other thing that helps is to make a big effort to steady the camera when taking a picture.I am using regargable NiMH batteries and am quite pleased with the time between charges."
1,Only for the curious...,"I bought the first one of these cameras in a thift shop for less than three dollars. Since it did not have a USB cable I got this one though Amazon. It turned out that neither camera was operational. What attracted me was the 2 1/4 x 1 1/2 x 1/4 inch size. If I saw one for under $5.00 I would still buy it, but I am nuts. Read other reviews if you want to know how bad the thing is even when it is working. If you just want to take pictures buy a diffrent camera.By the way, I don't think the PHILIPS logo has anything to do with the highly reputable Philips Electronics of the Netherlands."
2,How to delete photos,press the mode button until CA appearspress the shutter button one time and CA starts to flashwhile CA is flashing press the shutter button again and its deleted
3,What do you expect for under $20?,"I bought this for a Secret Santa gift for a co-worker at the storefront of an Amazon affiliate. For a cheap digital camera that has a fixed focus and no flash this works really well. Don't hold the camera up to your face, hold it a foot or two in front of you and look through the view finder to line up the shot. As long as the area was well lit, the photo came out well (for that resolution) (quality of the photos are less than that of most camera phones)The webcam surprised us too, slow response and you needed the area well lit, but for under $20 we were pleasantly surprised. If you want a decent digital camera buy something else, if you want something for fun snapshots for email, or just to have on your keychain for a quick picture this will be fun."
2,abstract language makes it hard for intended readers,"Abstract ideas and language in this work gave my friend a hard time understanding the content. They also make it difficult for those who do understand it to explain the text to their ESL friends. It could have been better, i suppose."
1,Brenda doesn't care,this book was so disappointing! I didn't learn A THING. but what's worse -- BRENDA DOESN'T CARE. It's so obvious! I's so sad! DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!
5,My kids love this hat!,"My 7yr old has to dress up like a bug for his 1st grade class this spring. I started to look early for a costume because I knew that would be hard to find. I thought this hat would be a cute idea! I'm going to have him wear it with a red shirt and red sweatpants. He'll be the perfect fire ant! It fits him perfectly! It stretched out to fit me too, I'm 37. I think I""ll go ahead and order the grasshopper hat for my 6yr old to wear for 1st grade next year."
2,Quality is Lacking,"First off, let me say this is a very cute set. However the stitching started to come undone after one wash. The stripped fabric is VERY cheap, not what I would expect from a $200 bedding set. It pills and fades after just one wash, very disappointing. I am sorry but I expect more. Only buy this set if you are willing to replace it after a couple months of use."
4,Cute,I think this is a very good idea for a gift to a teen or kid. Comes in handy and kinda fun to do.
5,Great Score!,This cartoon has some really great music! Check out the main title and end credits. Top notch!
3,Vengeance Rising not forgotten,"Those of us who remember, are familiar with the controversial departure years ago by founding member Roger Martinez. Aside from the growling vocals which I don't like, this is good heavy metal. I would have probably given it four stars if the vocals were discernable. As I recall, Roger Martinez had to throw together a band for this cd due to contract obligations. So, it was a bit rushed. Deliverance founder/guitarist/vocalist Jimmy Brown plays guitar under an assumed name. His talents alone certainly boosted the quality of this disc. Get this disc for those times you're burned out on the rest of your collection."
2,Warning about the Videos on the Bonus disc,"I have always enjoyed Delerium music and when I saw that this CD came with a Bonus Videos I was stoked. I love being able to have great visuals with great music. So when this CD arrived I went strait to the DVD player and put the Bonus disc in.Didn't work...To my surprise I found out that I have to play this on my computer to watch the videos and must be linked to the internet.I paid an extra 5 dollars to be able to watch something via internet when I can just go strait to Youtube and see the same thing.This is not a bad rating because of the music, love the music. Just pissed about the viewing format of the videos."
2,Sorely Disappointed,"I too have been a fan since the Front Line Assembly days. I find Karma to be the best of the Delerium series. Perhaps my expectations were too high.As others have written, the lyrics and style are recycled, throw--away, and cliche'.I'm been trying to have an open mind on playing the CD again, but alas it's barely listenable. The banality of the lyrics (and remix ""scratching"") are shocking, coming from a high quality duo as Delerium.The Enhanced CD was a waste of time with a bunch of old videos I've already seen.Maybe they've produced this CD to pay the bills, as many of these songs are suitable for commercials, and little else."
1,"FAN SINCE ""Faces, Forms & Illusions""","Two words...""Stone Tower"". If you are a Delerium fan and don't know it, SHAME ON YOU! I guess Bill had to make some money."
3,"For a Delerium CD - 2 Stars, as a Rock CD - 4 Stars","So over all this cd gets 3. I agree with the people that say this is straying father and father from that dark sound that was orignally Delerium. However, this cd has merit on it's own right. They lyrics are amazing if you stop and actually listen to them. More than once I have found myself going, ""Yeah thats me right now"". I've come to love ""After All"" (Yes many people hate this song), ""Run for it"", however my current favorite is ""Truly"". To me this cd has a sound that you listen to once and then get drawn into, phases to move through.""Stopwatch Hearts"" on the second disk is also well worth a listen or two.The people who said that this isn't Delerium are right and wrong. This isn't who Delerium used to be. They're evolving. We have to respect them for that. However, this is still a great cd to listen to."
4,It grew on me,"I bought this hoping it would be along the lines of Karma and Semantic Spaces which are both incredible. I have been disapointed with Poem and especially Archives Vol 1 (I don't care at all for it). Chimera is interesting. At first I thought ""hmmm"" might be good, then I didn't think I was going to like it. After listening to it, it grew on me an now I enjoy it. It's nice, easy listening. I have added it to my library and listen to it regularly."
1,Don't buy this CD.,"I'm a long-time Delerium fan, actually since Frontline Assembly. I find it odd that this album has gotten so many positive reviews here. I consider(ed) Delerium among my favorite artists due to the seemless intergration of electronica, ethereal vocals and hypnotic rhythms--all tied neatly together with a bit of an experimental sounding edge. Chimera has none of these qualities. After playing the CD for the first time, I kept hitting the 'next' button, desperately trying to find a track that didn't sound like a prefab pop tune crafted for airplay. No such luck. The bottom line is all the songs sound the same; all of which would be right at home on the CD of the latest MTV pop drone. Please, please don't go out and buy this CD just because you loved Poem and Karma. Listen to it in the store or (gasp!) online first and then make your decision."
4,Not my favorite Delerium CD,"It's good, but there's a lot of Delerium's stuff I'd recommend before this one."
3,Reuse and Recycle,"This album has grown on me, and I like it quite a lot now.However, the first time I listened to it, I didn't like it at all. It was as if Delerium recycled everything from Karma and Poem, gave the songs musical backdrops from Semantic Spaces, and intros from Spheres and Spheres II.I think I best described it to a friend: ""If I think of it as *another* Delerium album, and not *the new* Delerium album, I like it just fine."""
2,Formulaic,"This Delerium album HAS followed what has been a proven formula of using female vocalists to create an ambient dance-pop sound. The result on Chimera however is just that: formula. There is nothing new, nothing exciting left on this album. Several of Madonna's albums from the 90's (Bedtime Stories, for example) have touched many of the tones and movements on this album. As exciting and different as Semantic Spaces was, this album follows into mapped territory, contributing nothing but a watered down version of former Delerium sounds."
3,This is NOT Delerium,"They can call it Delerium, this is NOT Delerium tho. There are still great songs (Just A Dream, Eternal Odyssey and Serenity) but this album aint live up to my expectations. They left their ambient sound to gain a barely-listenable pop one (what the heck has Touched been made for?!). I just hope they'll receive these whinings, get back to work and create really good music (how they used to do a couple of years ago). Pop is not the way to go through!!"
3,Painful to listen to,"I only say that this was painful to listen to because I was so excited to see that Delerium had put out a new CD. My Delerium CDs are the most listened-to of any in my collection, but Chimera...what can I say? I just skipped some of the tracks because they were so bad. The lyrics of some songs are just plain predictable and cheesy. I can't say how disappointed I am. I had to give it a 3 just because it's Delerium, but if I just tuned into the music on the radio...it would probably be two stars."
2,Boring!,"I have been a Delerium fan since Semantic Spaces came out and have been a fan ever since. But with the release of Chimera I was really dissapointed. It all sounded the same, and no time or effort had been put into it. I know you shouldn't compare albums but compared to Semantic Space and Karma, this album isn't even worthy!!"
4,Artists sound evolves,"I admit to not being all that pleased with this album at first listening. However, the more I listened, the more this album worked its way into my subconcious. I would find myself humming the tunes at work or in the car. Yes, it is a departure from some of their earlier efforts, but the point of artistic endeavors, music included , is evolution and change. I like that this album differs so much from previous endeavors. True, there are some misses on the album, the most notable being Forever After, but even then, the weakest song is still miles better than most other pop offered today. Once again, the strongest feature of Delirium, varied instrumentation and changing vocalists lends itself to what is ultimately a great album. The two standouts of this particular work are After All and Fallen."
2,"Oh dear, how disappointing!","I became a fan of Delerium for their dark, haunting melodies in ""Semantic Spaces"" and ""Karma"". By comparison this seems very ordinary - a few electronic riffs thrown in to spice up what are basically pop songs.That being said - I did enjoy their two instrumental pieces, ""Serenity"" and ""Eternal Odessey"", which had some of the old Delirium ""feel"", and the catchy ""Stopwatch Hearts"" which was on the bonus disk."
2,Too poppy,I am a huge fan of Delerium but this album I think is less than memorable. Anytime Delerium puts out a new CD I am there at the store waiting to get it the first day it is out. I got in my car put this CD in and was in disbelief that this was delerium. This CD just sits on a shelf collecting dust now. Balligomingo's CD sounds more like Delerium than this does. If you are looking for the haunting sounds of the earlier Delerium you will not find it on Chimera. If you are looking for forgetable dance mix usa type music this is the cd for you.
1,Worst Delerium production to date,"I cannot begin to describe my disappointement with this CD. If I wanted to hear this commercial garbage, I would just turn the radio on. All of the creativity and uniqueness that made Delerium special are not present in this CD. I'm very surprised that one the most creative groups over the last 10 years would follow the commercial pop template in their new music. A real shame...."
2,Bye Bye New Age -Hello 80's House Music,What happened? Where are the world beats? Wheres the ambiance of their earlier work ?They been replaced by generic disco beats! If you wanna flashback to the 80's house/latin/disco era this is the disc. If you want new delerium try their clone balligomingo instead - at least they sound like delerium.
3,nothing to special,"j thought that it should be something different,but it's so boring and don't given to me any emotion,j can't comparate with poem,semantic spaces and karma.j hope the best from them in future."
3,Don't expect the same,"We've come to expect that Delerium would continue to produce music of similar quality as ""Screens"" and ""Karma"". ""Chimera"" does not come close. True, there are some good tracks on the CD (particularly ""After All"" and ""Forever After""), but Bill and Rhys have clearly tried to become more commercial and their music (and particularly the lyrics) are paying the price.As a fan of the genre, I still enjoy the tone, but the mood of the CD is a bit to poppy for me. Unfortunately (for comparison purposes only), Karma is perhaps the best album around, and it is difficult to live up to such lofty expectations. Certainly in comparison to previous works this one falls short."
4,"Surprising, but in a good way?","I was psyched when I learned this album was comming out, and I must admit that I was a bit dissappointed. I'd give it 3 and 1/2 stars. Previous reviewers have commented on the pop style of the album, and I agree with them. Chimera has a lot of top-40 style stuff on it. It's still very high quality....listen to anything on here and then listen to britney and tell me that Chimera has no art. It is a good album by normal standards. There are no songs on it that are ""bad."" (Except for maybe Magic, which sets my teeth on edge). It just doesn't have the sweet beauty of Poem or the allure of Karma. A group that usually releases masterworks has released an ""average"" CD. It was bound to happen."
2,Disappointed with Delerium's new direction,This album as has been stated in other reviews lacks any sense of the darkness and mystery that previous albums were so rich in. Delerium is one of my favorite groups and I do not hestitate to purchase any album from groups I enjoy -- but I urge customers to sample some of this album's tracks before wasting money making this purchase. I found it a terrible departure from the relaxing sound I enjoyed most from this band.
1,"Rhys & Leeb, how could you?","I never thought I'd be so disappointed with a Delerium disc, especially one featuring the return of Rhys. What the hell happened? What happened to the mystique and emotion of Delerium? It's been replaced by bland, emotionless, irrelevant pop with throw-away lyrics and throw-away music. Everything I love about Delerium is gone on this one. Even a return of Kristy Thirsk, whose magical voice gave Flowers Become Screens life, couldn't salvage this wreck. It sounds exactly like one of those countless clones that jumped on the popularity of the Delerium-Enigma-esque music in the recent years. I'm really sad to say this, but since Karma things have been going steadily downhill, and I'm including Rhys's Conjure One CD (which was at least a bit better than this effort, or lack of thereof)."
3,Ecstatically Beautiful in Places,"""Every time you go awayI will follow youWhen you're running scaredand you hide awayI'm right beside you...""An eclectic fusion of angelic voices and percussive elements mingle with exotic rhythms in an ecstatic dance of emotion. There is a heightening of the feelings of elation from the start as the rhythm takes off at top speed.Love, Touched and Fallen have ecstatically beautiful moments. While there are moments on this album I skip over because they feel too heavy, the lighter textures in the songs I have found to love are especially beautiful.Eternal Odyssey has nature sounds surrounded by world music, but the intensity seems to overwhelm the moment. Returning is also very heavily textured. My ears seem a little sensitive to their heavy beats.""What I wouldn't give to feel the sunlight on my faceWhat I wouldn't give to be lost in your embrace...""~The Rebecca Review"
3,Inconsistently good,"The thing I disliked the album is the increased blandish vocals and pop put on the album. The first few tracks were just lame except for ""After all"". and the rest of other songs with vocals just didn't seem interest me. The only exceptions I can say would be ""After all""feat. Jakl and ""Eternal Odyssey""(which is one of the only two ambient songs).Can Delerium deliver someting else other some cheesy vocals?"
5,This is a really great album save for some duds.,"These negative reviews are just a bunch of dirty laundry.Delerium's newest album ""Chimera"" is a very good album, in fact a great album.""Chimera"" has a much lighter and more accessible sound in their music than any of their older albums did, even more so than ""Poem"" did from three years back.My favorite songs are the opening track ""Love"",""After All"", and ""Serenity"".There are some duds like the throwaway ""Touched"" and ""Run For It"" which are worthy of passing by but overall, this album does not dissappoint. I can't say it ranks up there with ""Karma"" or ""Semantic Spaces"" but this album is nonetheless a very good album and worth buying.Top votes from me."
1,What is this?,"I really enjoy Delerium and have thoroughly enjoyed the solo project of Fuller (Conjure One). This cd however sounds like bad pop music. I can't say that the cd is entirely a waste there are a few songs that are very good. Other than that at time I am wondering what happened to this band that I liked. A bunch of different artist singing about love replaces the mystical sounds that kept you engaged to this other world sound on previous records. Some of the songs are so bad that they remind me of bad disco. It's a horrific experience for anyone expecting another good cd from Delerium. There are still three good songs on here though. So if you want to waste your money for very few good songs buy this. I can't say enough bad things about the cd, even if you like Poem this is nothing like it. They could find beter artist on American Idol and have a kid mix in a basement and sound 10x better. It just leaves me thinking what happened???"
2,Wondering if this CD would make a passable Xmas present...,"Half-way in during the first track, I began scratching my head and wondering if what I was listening to, was indeed Delerium. I looked at the cover and indeed it was Chimera, Delerium. If I wanted to listen to pop I would have turned on the local radio.Delerium - in its early years, made the best style of beats - dark ambient electronica. What this CD is, is a direct opposite...the music actually gave me a head ache and I had too turn it off. And now I am pressed finding someone to give this CD away too.But as a continuing fan, I will not give up on Delerium."
2,Oh no...Please NO,"Now, I am a fan of Delerium's past two masterpieces - Karma, and Poem.With this album, the band (if you can call them that now), have gone for a huge commercial spell.Every SINGLE song on here features someone from a popular band on vocals, and gone are the beautiful tribal and ambient beats, to be replaced by something you would hear in your cheesy rave nights.Delerium were so wonderful two-three years ago - what the hell happened to them? Did they fall into the same commercial trap that hit Nine Inch Nails and other great industrial artists of the surrounding genres?Who knows. I don't want to waste $% (or $$ if you live where I do!!) on the next album in order to be disappointed again. I'll stick to my underground goth that nobody else has ever heard of - at least I can be certain that they will not let me down in my search for deeper, more meaningful music."
2,skip this... go with the old Delerium,I love Delerium... but I can't stand the new Delerium. The older stuff is so much better. This CD is lame and boring. Go with Semantic Spaces or Spheres instead.
2,Delerium is dead,"I tend to agree with most of the other low rating reviewers. Older Delerium rocked, but this album sounded like so much other crap thats out there."
2,"Overall a decent read, but...","...he tends to repeat himself, maybe this is as the previous gentleman stated, because this was a series of magazine articles to begin with but I got tired of hearing the phrase ""ribbon of _______"" (whatever the Aussies call Asphalt over there , begins with a ""B"")used every time he was refering to the road. At one point this overused phrase was repeated two pages in a row, which I found simply ridiculous.There were a few other descriptions that were phrased too close for comfort as well thoroughout the book. I guess this tale really needed an editor to point out the obvious flaws. I mean I'm no literary expert and even I saw these things.But, as I hinted at with the title to this ""review"", overall it was a fair read. I finished it in two marathon sessions and once he gets going, this book sails pretty seemlessly."
5,Great book!,This book was a pleasure to read. Roff Smith is a professional writer with a great first-hand story to tell.
4,Pretty Good Story,"This was an enjoyable, light read about a guy's bicycle trip around Australia. He has lots of interesting adventures and gives detailed descriptions of the scenery.I wished he had given a little more info on what his circumstances were that led him to decide to do this trip (he wasn't an athlete or bicycle racer), and how it changed him after it was over. But overall it was a pretty good story about adventures with the people and places in Australia."
1,DO NOT DOWNLOAD ANYTHING FROM THIS ALBUM,"The tracks on this album are completely scrambled. Before buying anything, preview it first. I downloaded Pachelbel's Canon and got Winter Wonderland. As it turns out, what's listed as Winter Wonderland is Pachelbel's Canon, but not all the other items are 1:1 switches like that.EPIC FAIL."
5,A Mystical Masterpiece,"This book is one of the greatest ever written! I know this may sound absurd to the casual reader since the storyline is really silly and the language is quite flat. However, if you take the time to look beyond the superficial, a whole new world of fascinating brilliancy will appear. This book is up there with Finnegans Wake; it should come with a set of manuals. But those who know how to use it will never reveal what they find! This is the book where Gann has concealed his most powerful tool, never to be taught in any of the other books or courses. And it is not ""just astrology"" or the long biblical cycles. The bad news is that it is damned hard to find, it has taken me six years of study to say: now I understand its construction, and I still have a distance to go. How far, I don't know, but it is a fascinating journey! I'll give you one clue: when you understand the importance of Walter's puppy love you are on the right track..."
5,understanding the master time cycle,I feel that alot of gurus claim to have understood this book however I have never seen nor heard a prediction showing an interpretation or clear representation of these wonderful works.I feel that those who do understand would never be inclined to sell courses or in anyway profit from the knowledge within.That is why one must read and understand the bible.Only you know if you have been chosen and when you are you will truly be a believer in GOD. I am a humble mole in the tunnel. please read and getteth thy wisdom and with thy wisdom gaineth thy understanding.
4,Great T.V,"After my first televison blew up in a lightning storm. I had to purchase a new one and decided to up-grade. After weighing out all the pros and cons of other tvs. I decided to go with the samsung. The price was right and It being HDTV ready, and having progressive scan was all good. The only problem I have with it is the weight but I was able to lug it up to my second floor apartment. But I do suggest getting a progressive scan dvd player and component cables to hook up your new televison."
4,Great value for your buck with this TV,"It is nice to find a TV that is HDTV ready and in the widescreen format for under [$$$]. The picture looks great for my two cents, especially for the price. The menues are easy to access and use. The owner's manual is simple and straightforward. It is a heavy TV, it weighs over a 120 pounds. My complaints are minor in terms of some of the features, the 4:3 ratio for regular tv viewing appears to be the size of a 19 inch screen. You lose approximately 3 inches on each side. Also would have like the TV to have preview button that cycles through the channels."
2,Disappointing,"I have always owned Sony televisions but recently I purchased the next model up (model no. TXM3097HF) from a national retailer and I have to say I was disappointed. The resolution was not very good and the color quality when playing DVD's appears washed out. I am returning it and replacing it with a Sony Wega television. On the plus side, it looks great and has a wonderful remote which is very easy to use."
1,CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP,"I have been researching HDTVs and I have to warn people that although Samsung has been very aggressive, their products are still cheap looking and the quality of the picture is inferior to the many established brands -- Sony, Panasonic, Zenith and Sharp. If you're looking at a HDTV purchase, forget Samsung and look hard at any of the brands I just mentioned. Don't be fooled by this company. They copy the better brands and cut corners to give you a cheaper performing product."
4,"Good price, Good television, a little lacking in some areas","This item is a great set. The controls are easy to use once you get used to them. However, you'll break your back getting this weighty monster into your car (huge box!). The picture is good, however not as clear as a Sony or Mitsubishi HDTV-ready monitor. The widescreen is how these HDTV's should be, and for the price and the overall quality - it's the best bargon around town. I got mine for ($$$) at (LOCAL STORE). But with tax, it cost ($$$). If you can wait the 3 weeks to get it, you might as well get it with no tax and no shipping charge and let them deliver it!"
4,Very Good Value,"I'm very pleased with my TXM3096HF. (I notice with some chagrin that the negative reviews listed for this model seem to be ACTUALLY for a different model, the TXM3097HF).My biggest gripe about the TXM3096HF is the annoying remote control requires far too much fiddling, particularly when selecting the source (one must cycle through the choices, there is no direct one-button access to a particular source).Being a movie fan, I really love the 16:9 aspect ratio and the hi-def picture.My previous TV was a top-of-the-line Sony-XBR. The Samsung is sure better value-for-money!"
4,Great hat,My son who id 7 wore this all Christmas long. The quality was great. The bunny on the outside is velcro so it can be taken off and used for magic trick with the hidden pocket inside. So cute and original. Even the quality of the hat was a nice surprise.
1,Would not recommand it,The hat is too small for my four years old and it is not that great. My son tried it for five minutes and then let it down.
4,Fun hat but adult sized?,"My stepson really likes this hat and it's the only ""trick"" out of the magic set we got him that he really gets. He's only 4 so we didn't expect anything different. We also expected this hat to be big for him (although he does have a big head), but it is REALLY big. And on the hat or packaging itself it doesn't say anything about kids, but it seems to be an adult sized hat? Still fun and he can kind of wear it if he pushes it back a bit. Not sure if it's necessarily worth the money...but still a good purchase since he's definitely having fun with it!"
5,very cute,this was a gift for my niece and she loved it! She quickly learned how to pull a rabbit from her hat!
4,Kid's Magician w/Rabbit,"My kids love this Magician's Hat, and it goes nicely in our costume box to prevent cluttering our house any more... and they get it out for new friends or new visitors. This is a really nice buy because it's not going to break, it has the magic element of surprise and makes your kids feel clever! Kudos to the old Magic Hat with Rabbit trick!"
1,Very Cheaply Made,"I originally bought this to use the clothing on a different doll. But when I got it out of the box, the fake leather they used for the clothes basically crumbled in my hand. I managed to carefully get it off to use as a pattern, but if you plan on buying one of these figures to display, you'll have to leave it in the box for fear of it disintegrating on you."
4,for the next IPv6 Internet?,"Kuipers' PhD gives us an advanced treatment of the problems of implementing Quality of Service in the current [and future] Internet. He shows that the problems are hard, but overcoming them can give us new services or applications for the Web.The treatment is heavily mathematical. You need good prior knowledge of routing algorithms and especially of those used in Internet packet routing. His ideas are very applicable to IPv6 if, or when, that becomes commonly deployed. Of course, part of the reason for its delay is that some basic methods, like its QoS and routing, could still do with improvement. Hence, the relevance of Kuipers' work."
2,BEWARE...DOES NOT PLAY WMA & MP3 FILES,"Yes, this unit sounds and looks good...BUT it does not, in no way shape or form play WMA and MP3 format CD's as the item description states. It's not just amazon, alot of online venders have the same description."
5,WOW!! Not bad,"It's small,look's great, and sound's alot bigger then it is. I am happy with mine. i live in an apartment and dont have space for one of thoughs big systems. this one does everyhting i need and still pisses the naghbors off :)"
3,Wrong Heading,"It says 6 in line which means they should fit on a fender. However, the ones that were delivered to me were 3 and 3 meaning they fit on a Gibson. As you can imagine, since I was expecting to be able to put these on my Strat, I was not very happy when they arrived. Luckily I also have a Gibson gold top so I put them on that guitar and they look sweet. The 3 rating is not for the quality of the machine heads but rather for the incorrect description."
5,"Magical, Strange, Everyday Reality","I really enjoyed Orange Candy Slices. The stories all take place in what was an exotic location to me -- the Rio Grande Valley of Texas -- but they have that rare blend of acute detail that makes you feel you know a faraway place and universal appeal. For example, ""The Tiny Bubble,"" about a girl finding out about puberty, combines the mysticism of a very different culture with details from the movies our elementary school showed us in fifth grade. Perhaps my favorite stories are ""The Flamingoes,"" ""The Magi,"" and ""The Cafe"" because of the way they show the relationship between the narrators and their grandparents. They remind us of how magical the everyday relationship between grandparents and grandchildren can be. If you've had that sort of bond, these stories will make you remember episodes of your own; if you haven't, they'll teach you something wonderful and new."
4,Great taste & easy...,"Have tried the Choc and Choc/Cheesecake flavors. Sometimes make low-fat Mousse from scratch (tip: the liquid lecithin in my recipe is what makes the difference). If you use this stuff according to label (the right milk, blend it right) it makes a tasty mousse that doesn't make me wish I did it from scratch. If you make it and it isn't smooth/creamy enough for you don't add cream, try a tad of lecithin :)"
5,Pastors Marc and Joy Cooper are ANOINTED!!!,"Pastors Marc and Joy Cooper of Miami, Florida are the blessed and anoited to preach and minister the gospel through song. I am very proud of them and the Miami Mass Choir for allowing the Lord to contiue using them. If you are ever in the Miami area, stop by the Cooper Temple Church of God In Christ to get your praise on. The album is just a blessing. So if you don't have it I suggest you get it. Savoy, I can't wait for their next release. I miss you'll in Miami."
4,Great Features for Price.,Just got mine today. Took a bit of fussing to make things work the way I wanted them too. Hooking this puppy up is definetely NOT for the timid. The only problem I have is that it has such good resolution that regular analog cable looks more grainy than it did on my old regular resolution TV (even with the digital enhancement feature turned on). DVDs viewed in progressive mode are stunning! This TV is the most customizable TV I have ever used. Minor issues: switching between video input sources is kind of cumbersome as you have to repeatedly press the button to cycle through them and the cycling is unnecessarily slow. Also: the TV makes this really annoying test tone when you turn it on. Overall I am very pleased.
1,Had the TV for 18 months and SLOWLY DYING...,Samsung is not being very understanding. Getting the run around from Samsung (saying the opposite of what the local Authorized Samsung Repair tells me)Buy Samsung ONLY if you want a DISPOSABLE TV. They do not stand behind their products.
1,Wish I had it,"I placed an order for this product three weeks ago, assuming that it would ship in ""approximately 1-2 weeks."" Well, I still haven't received it, and don't expect to receive it for another 2 weeks, bringing the grand total to over 5 weeks for when I placed the order. When I finally receive the item, hopefully I'll enjoy it. Whenever that may be."
3,Ramune Fizzy Candy,"It wasn't as big as I expected it to be, and I think it's only worth around $2-$3. But, it was good to try. It wasn't that fizzy, more powdering, but tasted very good and I couldn't stop eating them. It's a fantastic treat for anyone who loves Japanese Candy and Ramune drinks."
4,Great stuff,"I got this for a friend that likes japanese candies. I myself have tried it, and it was a nice treat. First off, this fascinating ramune soda candy is in a small plastic bottle that is reminiscent of a ramune soda drink bottle(minus the marble and glass bottle), and it is about half the size of one as well. The candy is in the shape of pellets and sort of tastes like ramune, but the taste could also be similar to Smarties or Wonka Fun Dip candy sticks in pellet form. Nonetheless a great candy."
5,the under rated great singing actress,"I was lucky enough to be living in New York City when Scotto was singing her greatest roles at the met. With the absence of Callas and Tebaldi at the met, I made a point of seeing all of Scotto's performances. Butterfly, Elizabeta, Adriana, Luisa, and she performed the best desdemona I ever saw or heard. This CD contains perfoemance I was not lucky to see or hear."
4,THE NORMANDY OPERETTA,"CORNEVILLE is a FRENCH town in NORMANDY.The people in CORNEVILLE know about that operetta just like the people in OKLAHOMA know about the famous musical.The libretto uses FRENCH dialect(the equivalent of AMERICAN slang) which was rather unusual at the time 1877.A very popular work of the genre,achieving a thousand representations over a ten year period.It is still being presented today, and has retained the particular charm it always had.MADY MESPLÉ ,the queen of FRENCH operettas revivals in the sixties and seventies plays GERMAINE.MADY has retired from the stage and is now a singing teacher who gives master classes.This recording was made in 1973.The part of HENRI DE CORNEVILLE was a favorite of famed FRENCH singer MICHEL DENS who played it many times on the stage.So now,everybody knows that NORMANDY is not only famous for the war debarquement.You can actually hear the bells a few times during the recording."
5,Replacements were never Soul Asylum?,"...The early Replacements albums were inspired bits of punk genius, a decade ahead of their time. Stink, like Sorry Ma, Hoot, Let it Be and Tim blended punk fury with intelligent, deep thoughts like few bands have ever pulled off."
4,Sweet but short,This a great album from a great band but this probably isn't the first Replacements album one should buy. Not a bad bunch of songs but very short. I doubt if it clocks in at over twenty minutes.
5,Classic Replacements All the Way,"This album is for the pure hard core Replacements fan. For fans that are only familiar with the later material, you will not find a Skyway or Sadly Beautiful type song here. God Damn Job is one of the funniest god damn songs I have ever heard."
4,Damn good early thrash from the greatest band ever,"Sure, this record isn't quite in the same league as the band's best stuff--what albums are? By anyone?--but it's funny, raucous music with balls, heart, and soul. And ""Go"" has some real depth to it if you listen closely."
3,Poor Packaging....,"It's no wonder that many are tossing their CD's in the trash in favor of MP3's. With packaging as poor as this why would you even want the CD? The music itself irregardless of what Westerberg thinks about it now is close to essential, not quite as important as ""Let It Be"" or ""Pleased To Meet Me"" but none the less a vital trasnsition EP that paved the way for the the later records. But the reissue packaging is abysmal. No liner notes no info other than the original back of the EP jacket basically no nothing and the booklet that is with it is a single piece of glossy paper! not really a booklet. My suggestion is this, this EP as good as I think it is is not really nessesary given the poor packaging so I would pass on it and skip right to ""Let It Be"" and ""Pleased To Meet me"" or even skip back to ""Sorry ma Forgot To Take Out The Trash"" however be forwarned that the same company has reissued them all so I suspect the packaging is equally inferior on the rest..."
2,Failed Attempt At Hardcore,"We all know they made some great stuff, or we wouldn't be looking at this page at all, would we ? They also did some extremely overrated stuff like Stink. The Replacements improved with age, and while stuff like this was rife in the early 80's,these guys really weren't very good at being Black Flag or Husker Du. I love the intro with the police breaking up a show, and musically ""Go"" is a great tune, up there with their best, and it redeems this one somewhat. I agree with Paul when he says he can't listen to this anymore, as a mature musician myself, I now understand."
1,WEIRD CZECH MOVIE,"This movie was another example of a really weird modern Czech movie. They often seem to think this way of American and British pop culture and we really don't want to see the details of their weird soccer club people. This movie sucks!! I wish that we could get more of their movies from the eighties like ""Slnce, Seno a Jahody"" (Sun, Hay and Strawberries) subtitled in English."
2,This is a comedy?,"The summary of this movie makes it sound like a light-hearted happy-go-lucky type of film. Unfortunately, it is exactly the opposite. Aside from the funny scene involving the Colonel, I didn't see much humor. Mainly this movie revolves around the serious (not funny) topics of neglect, racism, and self-worth. At first I thought that maybe I just wasn't getting the Czech type of humor, but by the end I was thoroughly depressed. Maybe if my expectations had been different I could give this more than 2 stars. If you like deep, thoughful movies, then this might suit you, but don't expect Sideways part 2."
2,Two hours of misery among losers,"For me, my low rating of this film might be, at least in part, the result of having wrong expectations about it.I had heard this film described as 'charming' and 'funny,' and was expected a comedy, albeit a somewhat black one. But despite the good acting, this film left a sour taste in my mouth.It is a dismal and agonizingly dreary film about people you never come to care about. I am an avid foreign language film buff, but I could not see the merit in this crude, hate-ridden and depressing story."
1,WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SUBTITLES?,"I tried to watch this dvd, but after about 10 minutes gave up. It was impossible to watch because only bits of the conversations between the characters were translated. I've seen some poorly subtitled foreign films, but this was by far the worst. Don't bother until a dvd with decent subtitles is released."
2,20 min abs?,"Completly disappointed in this DVD. The only Rodney Yee video I've done that was really annoying (I own about 5 by him). Neither work-out was 20 min.,which I've noticed in other Gaiam dvds. Not only did they not focus on abs, but they specifically focussed on hips/legs, & shoulders/arms, with pretty much no ab work. My girlfriend didn't like it, so gave it to me. I am a yoga instructor, and found them to be too basic, so I'm giving it to my mother. *If it was called Short Intro to Hatha Yoga (w/ a few intermediate postures), I'd have no problem with it."
1,Nothing to do with tummy toning,This DVD was a total rip off. The posture on the front isnt even in the DVD. This is not expected of GAIAM products.In future I will make sure the product has a high rating on this website before I buy it.
2,not pleased with the delivery process,"When you expedite a product to be delivered at a sert about of day and pay extra for shipping and handling, this product should make it to your customer within that given date they purchase a product from your stores.I'm not sure if I'll every purchase another item from you again not knowing I'll get it in a timely fashion. For example I order this product on December 16,2006 and didn't get the product till December 26, 2006. Paying extra S/H for a producted you didn't get for 4 days after the expected time is way to much to be paying extra S/H for. A reinburstment would greatly appriecated if possible on this purchase.Thank you,Patricia Williams"
3,Samsung Extended battery,"Thanks.Quick shipping.Product does not seem to have an ""extended"" battery life. Purchased to replace 2 standard batteries that were losing full charge from a 2 minute phone call. After replacing, do not seem to really get that much more life. Possibly something with the phone, although all power management settings are set to turn the phone off to conserve life."
2,Starter set of instructions,"This book provided a good overview of the general issues and gave a lot of examples for VB and C++ programmers. Would have been much more helpful if a quick reference card was provided to show the ADSI and LDAP object models with all of the available properties, attributes, etc."
5,"Only one problem with this book, It need a security Chain.","I have found only one problem with this book. It needs a security chain built in to lock it to my desk. It has an annoying tendency to get barrowed when I am not ask my desk.I would suggest that Amazon bundles it with ""how to train your Doberman to guard your computer books""I would recommend that any who likes this book, check out Charles Oppermanns other book that is the sequel of this integrated with dot.net. It is here at Amazon under the title ""Programming Directory Services with Microsoft .Net and Xml"".The only problem is that Microsoft canceled it.Maybe if enough of us ask for them to release it....I have taken a lot of information in this book and integrated it with dot.net on my own. But it's my belief that we need the Sequel.Joe."
2,Starter set of instructions,"This book provided a good overview of the general issues and gave a lot of examples for VB and C++ programmers. Would have been much more helpful if a quick reference card was provided to show how the ADSI and LDAP models were architected showing all of the available properties, attributes, etc."
4,"Nice, but paint comes off with water and use...","I have purchased the entire collection of the Linda Spivey Outhouses. The liquid soap dispenser is really cute. The pump has since broke, but really I'm much happier with this than the soap dish which has most of the paint off. I would only suggest that if you purchase this you try your hardest not to get it wet. When this collection gets wet, the paint rubs off. Since this is for the bathroom, I really think the paint should be better than it is."
2,Paint comes off when wet...,"I bought the entire collection and have been rather pleased with most of it. This soap dish however is not one of my favorites. The paint rubs off when wet...I'm not sure if it was the soap in the dish or the fact that it got wet from use. Either way neither should have happened since this is in fact a soap dish. I would go with a liquid soap dispenser instead. I also bought that and it has since broke, but it's been a couple of years. The pump is the part that broke."
5,Adorable,"This piece goes perfectly with my collection. I haven't used it as a soap dish, just as decoration since I don't use bar soap. It's adorable and still looks new a year later."
4,Beautiful but came with defects,"We were impressed with the quality fabric of this shower curtain which is similar to canvas and the quality of color looks just like a painting. However, ours came with a few stains we couldn't remove. Looks like rust stains. Anyhow, if it's free of defects, it's a wonderful item. Even prettier than the picture online!"
1,too small for the intended purpose,Way too small to be useful as a wastebasket in the bathroom. Very pretty so I kept it and used it in a corner for folded magazines in the bathroom and also I thought I could put plant in it.
4,"Thankfully, not all homeschoolers are pedantic!","This was the first book about homeschooling I read and all the rest have been disconcerting in comparison.The Colfaxes present, in matter of fact fasion, how they taught their own. Their motivation for doing so was practical rather than ideological. They don't pretend to tell you how to teach your own children - just how they managed to teach theirs.The only drawback is that some of the references are out of date - the Colfaxes taught their children in the 70's and 80's. However good sense (I don't say common, because I don't believe it is) will lead interested readers to updated references: Enyclopedias on CD-Rom rather than in book form, for example.A great book for intelligent parents who suspect that they can teach their child(ren) more effectively than any overworked and underappreciated teacher can."
2,The references to resources are completely outdated.,"This book would be perfect if only it's references were updated, because they are a very significant part of the book's value. The narrative at the beginning of the book (about the authors' experience in homeschooling) is thought-provoking for those who are considering homeschooling their children. The parts of the book that I would have found most useful were the references to materials for teaching reading, writing, arithmatic, and science at home. The book was written in the 80s and a lot of the materials it references are from the 70s or earlier and were mostly out of print."

4,"Great sound, stylish looks","in a nutshell:*) great sound with very rich bass;*) subwoofers really make a difference! (I also own a Panasonic SC-PM03, so I could compare);*) MP3 playback is OK, I haven't tried WMA files yet;*) pay attention on how deep this unit is, it might not fit into your shelving system.all in all - great choice!"
1,Box Was Correct Item...Item Inside Was Not,"Ordered Panasonic SC-PM47 mini system on Aug. 30th. On Sept 30th item was delivered. Correct item was pictured on the box. When I opened the box a model SA-PM47 was inside. Not the item I ordered. I called 1.800.201.7575 and was handed off from one uninformed representative to another. I asked for a supervisor but was given an order specialist. I cannot beleive that I spent 10 minutes with the first representative then transferred to the Electronics department only to be told , ""I guess they are not open right now""I was charged for my free shipping.Now 30 days after placing my order I am told that this item cannot be reordered and the only thing I can do is return the item.POOR SERVICE is unacceptable and we as customers can address poor service by taking our business alsewhere."
5,Ok to GO is much more than OK!,"Virginia Coalition's latest gem ""Ok to Go"" is a rare find for all of those non-familiars with VACO's music. This is the album to write home about and pull future fans onto the bandwagon with all of the rest of us who have been followers for years. Right out of the gate they give us the sure to be radio hit, ""Pick Your Poison"", with its perky beats and catchy lyrics. Track 1 is followed by a string of songs that will soon find lighters in dark venues when played to fans: ""Last Goodbye"" (my favorite), ""Voyager 2"", ""Mason-Dixon"", ""Meteor""... Add to that line-up an old familiar ""Walk to Work"", a new banana that is going to take most of us back to our years in the 80's ""Bumpin' Fresh"" and of course the hidden track of all hidden tracks! This is the CD that I am using to woo all my friends, family,and strangers alike to the lyrical, ready to party genius of Virginia Coalition!"
5,"great band, great album","I've been a VACO fan for years now, and this album definately doesn't dissappoint. I'm a big fan of ""Voyager 2,"" probably my favorite song on the album. ""Walk to Work"" and ""Come and Go"" are two old favorites and road staples that make 2nd appearances on the album, both with a bit of a fresh sound, although remaining mostly the same.I'm not very good with individual song reviews, so I'll just say a few words about the band. These guys are awesome. They are all amazingly talanted musicians and great, creative songwriters. They have more energy than just about every band I've ever seen live. Go to a show if you get the chance, you won't regret it. All 4 of their albums rock, you would be doing yourself a favor if you start listening to VACO"
5,This works after another brand failed,"I bought this at a local store because I was traveling and couldn't wait for the (lower priced) Amazon shipment. I had previously tried the ELAGO High Speed SD card reader. That one failed after one try, as I noted in my Amazon review. The Targus has worked many times and is fast and reliable. This is just a one to one comparison, but I'd trust Targus in the future for small electronics."
2,OK,"I got this off site to replace the 3rd kodak camera cable that quit working. This reader worked good for about a year of light use then just quit. Apparently like everything else from china, its ""disposable""."
2,humor forced,"Loved the title, but I found the book's humor to be forced. The author seemed to be trying too hard. Would have to say avoid it if you wanted a stocking stuffer or good gag gift."
4,great value,"This is a great way to get HDTV without breaking the bank. And since it is a 27-inch, it fits well even in my small apartment. The colors are very vivid and the clarity is amazing, especially with digital channels. Even the analog channels look somewhat better than with an analog TV, because all analog signals get upconverted to digital. Connectivity is good, enough to connect an HDTV set-top, cable, or satellite box, a DVD player, and a VCR. The component connections are necessary for the best picture on a DVD, and essential for a HDTV set top box. Glad that it has two high-definition component connections! Granted this may not be as good as a giant projection screen with DLP, but this is a great entry-level HDTV if you are interested in the increased picture quality of digital TV."
4,skeptical but pleasantly surprised,I have been searching for a device to repair all the scratched up DVDs for a couple of years. I certainly didn't want to replace each one as that was too costly. I've reviewed several brands and models before settling on this one. I took the most scratched up DVD and ran it through the 5mn cycle. All of the glitches were repaired except for 1 - it was a pretty deep scratch. I ran it through a second time and the movie played like new. I am relieved that I won't have to throw away all those movies; I can just de-scratch them. My only con are the sparse instructions and the clean up of the machine afterwards. It is not an easy task to clean it up when you're done.
3,"Best Repair System, But too much trouble to use!","This is definately the best disc repair system out on the market I can assure you that. But the problem with it is that you have to re-empty the machine daily which is really annoying and can get messy. So every day you are filling it with the fluid, then draining and cleaning it. We clean 20+ discs a day, and it works wonders! But the clean up and draining on a daily basis gets old, its time consuming, and it is annoying. So if you are neededing to get the deepest scratches out of any disc and dont mind the clean up, then get it. Otherwise stick to the cheap 30-50 dollar cleaners!"
2,Worked Well For Awhile,"This disc repair unit worked very well for about 5 months. Soon after it just began faling apart. It now leaks, the hose to drain it has a very cheap hook to keep it in the upright position while it is running which has also broken. I have had to reorder replacement parts twice now. It is now at the point where the belts are sliping and will no loner spin the disc correctly in order to clean them. All in all it worked great for a couple of months. Now all I have is an expensive paper weight."
2,Aleratec Disc Repair system,"Very disappointed with this unit. It is extremely messy to use, the liquid goes all over the place - not a lot of thought put into conserving consumables. Worst of all is the finish. It will remove deeper scratches but it leaves its own shallower ""swirl"" scratches.Do not buy this unit if you are looking for perfect finish. An el cheapo unit I previously bought on on Ebay gave a better finish than the big Aleratec."
3,Get this only if you're mad about Mad,"This book is different from its Mad fellows in that everything is printed sideways, so that you have to hold the book like a wall calendar and turn the pages ""up"" as you go.Other than that, the book is once again a faithful repackaging of the comic talents that made Mad Magazine such an amazing success. There are parodies of Westerns, ""The Caine Mutiny,"" and the three Musketeer's among other things. Considering that the book was first published in the fifties, this stuff has aged pretty well.In general, however, I would recommend another book in the series, and that only if you're truly in love with the Mad way of life."
5,Great book for babies!,"Unknown whether our 6-month-old will be the ultimate bookworm, but she loves this book. The durable waterproof foam stands up to every assault. The pages are colorful, the pullout animals are great to chew on and big enough not to be swallowed. We'll see how the book stands up to teeth! But for now, this book is a pleasant change from rattles and pacifiers."
2,Cute,"I bought this for my grandson who is 9 months old. He is just getting into playing in the bathtub and I know he will love this. Can't wait for Christmas so he can have his book and play with it too.Well, I gave the book to my Grandson, and he really liked it. His Mom and I don't share the same feeling. The book is cute, but.....There are four pages to the book. The first page is fine...What Sound does the chicken make.....then the page next to it has a place for the chicken puzzle piece.Next page-What sound does a cow make....Baa Baa and the piece for the sheep fits there.Next. What sound does a pig make.....Moo, Moo. and the cow fitsNext. What sound does the sheep make....oink, oink and the pig fits.Talk about confusing a little kid. I don't know if it was just the book I got, but ARE YOU KIDDING ME?Update.....I wrote to the company that makes this book and they were gracious to send me a new book.....everything was correct in this one. So, my rating goes up to 4 stars!"
5,AWESOME for teething babies!!,We bought this for our 7 month old daughter and she loves taking the animals out and 'mouthing' each piece....the animal pieces are made very well considering all the biting and they still look great!
3,Flying Stories---How I became a Pilot and Engineer And What Happened After That,"This is a very interesting book, if one is interested in some detailed information about flying, and if you like the story of Arnold's life related to the title. A couple of criticisms: Arnold should have had someone, a journalist, English teacher, etc., take a look at his writing before the book was published. Why does he spell ""hangar,"" a respository for airplanes, as ""hanger,"" so many times? Also, in two consecutive sentences he doesn't even seem to know how to spell ""Morse,"" as in ""Morse Code."" And there are quite a number of typos here and there throughout the book that the fundamentalist would find fault with. And I suppose that one could criticize his organization; there are times that I didn't know what time in his life he was referring to. Overall, it was a fun book to read and well worth the less than $4.00 I paid via my Kindle."
5,very good book,"My two kids read it many times. They were 5 & 7 when I bought the book. 2 years later, they still enjoy reading the book. Very good book."
2,Little Angels,I was excited for my daughter to get this DVD but it wasn't what we had hoped it would be. It was short and it just didn't keep her attention. Good idea but bad execution.
3,Not my Favorite,"I'm a huge fan of Pilates, and love Mari Winsor, but was incredibly disappointed in this particular DVD. Since I have tightness in my neck and shoulders, and ocassionally my lower back, I thought I'd give it a try. The routines are designed for those who are unable to do normal pilates exercises, and since that is not me, I found the work-out to be too simple for me and therefore unhelpful. Although I do feel more relaxed after using this video, I do not feel my back is getting any stronger, and that is what I'm aiming for.If you want a simple, relaxing, back and leg stretching DVD, this is it. If you want back strengthening and stretching, I've found Yoga DVDs that focus on the back to be a lot more helpful. If you like pilates, stick with Mari's other DVDs."
4,"Pleased, but impatient.","This Pilates DVD has helped me strengthen my back and core, which has helped me to control my back pain. The workout is low impact and short, fitting easily into any half-hour segment of my day - no breaking a sweat, so you could even do this on a 1-hour lunch break and have time to spare.The one problem I found is that Winsor goes through the routine in a careful manner, and after almost memorizing the routine - but not being able to do it w/o the DVD - I get tired of waiting in between exercises while she explains about the next. It's not really her problem, in the end it's mine..."
2,A NOT HAPPY WITH TOSHIBA REVIEW,"I bought a toshiba sd 4700 the previous model before this oneand I must say that it performed well, However within a years time it refused to play certain dvd""s that I played many times before on it. It would just lock up at the menu and the machine would just freeze it was extreemly frustrating. So I got rid of it and bought the Harmon Kardon 101 DVD player which I must say blows the Toshiba out of the water, the color and sound are outstanding The Progressive scan on this machine should be what these other light weights are judged by..........."
3,Good while it lasted,"Worked great for about a year. Then strange things started happening. First, occasionally I couldn't turn the unit off. Then some DVDs wouldn't play although they did on other players. Finally, sometimes the DVD image would get stuck and a full volume very loud screech would come blaring out of all speakers. Ouch! So I am now looking for a replacement - of a different brand."
2,The Worlds Best Piano Arrangements,"Excellant arrangements for the songs chosen. I was, however, rather disappointed in the choice of songs and had assumed there would be the accompanying lyrics.That's my fault, I should have further investigated the choice before ordering."
1,"No neck support, extremely uncomfortable","Do not buy this product. There is no neck support, it is extremely uncomfortable. I had to return it."
5,Excellent product,"I've been using the original(purple) AB Roller Plus for several years with good results and decided to try the Keys Pro-Trainer Ab-Roller because I was looking for more of a gym quality machine. After using this product for a few days I must say it has exceeded all expectations. It is similar in quality to the Pro Trainer Culb model made by the AB Roller people, but at a third of the price. It is comfortable to use andprovides more workout options. Most importantly, it targets the abs much better than the AB Roller Plus. Unfortunately it doesn't come with a workout video, but using the AB Roller Plus workout video I find that I get a much better burn in my abs with the keys model."
2,I am sure it is great for the average person,"Very sturdy piece of equipment and I am sure it works great for average size people, but for me, 6'0, it just did not work for me, the neck rest hit too low and my arms were too long and did not rest on the pads, and the pivot point of the rocking was too short. For my wife, it was just the opposite, 5'1, she had the same problem but opposite, I gave this frame away, and will try something else."
1,Painful!,"I bought this ab roller after my chiropractor told me that I needed to strengthen my abs without straining my neck. The ""neck support"" that it comes with does not support the neck or head in any way, but forces all of the weight of the head onto the uppermost vertebrae of the neck. Ouch! I would strongly recommend AGAINST this purchase. Not only does it not work properly, but the foam pads were stained upon arrival. Gross! I will try another model."
2,Too Big To work out,"This is too big to work out.I'm having difficulty working out with this product.After Day 1, I put them away."
2,KEYS PRO TRAINER AB ROLLER,"IT MAY BE A GOOD PIECE OF EQUIPMENT, BUT IT'S TOO BIG. IT'S BIG BECAUSE YOU CAN LEAN ON IT AND DO LEG LIFTS, ETC. BUT ALL I WANTED TO DO WERE CRUNCHES. IT WAS HARD TO PUT TOGETHER ONLY BECAUSE THE SCREWS WOULD NOT FIT INTO THE SLOTS, I ALMOST BROKE MY FINGERS. I GAVE IT AWAY AND BOUGHT A SMALLER ROLLER THAT WORKS BETTER FOR ME."
5,The Most Underrated Irish Band,"I already owned ""Songs from Sun Street"" and ""Sing a Poweful Song"" before I bought this CD, so some of the songs were not new, but it was still well worth the price of the CD. The Saw Doctors fuse rock/blues/celtic/zydeco into a mix all their own and take you along for the ride. Their songs run the gamut of emotions as well from sentimental like ""Green and Red of Mayo"" to silly and hilarious like ""Hay Wrap""...truly the most underrated Irish Band-I never miss them when they tour the U.S."
1,Hardly any suction,"It does not work very well. I found that the suction is not enough to do the job. The one I got from the hospital for my baby looks similar to the ""Hospital's Choice Preemie Nasal Aspirator"", and that works much better. On the pro/positive side, it is easier to clean."
1,Doesn't work,"I could never get this to work. Because it's two pieces, when you squeeze the bulb, it doesn't provide a suction when you let go. I just gave up and continued using the one we got from the hospital."
1,Dont buy it!,"This aspirator barely sucks if you can call it that.It's a waste of money.I bought this product when I was pregnant.At 4months my son had a cold and the mucus in his nose was keeping him awake. I took the aspirator and tried to suck out the mucus but not even a drop was sucked up! I tried it later on my own nose and could barely feel any suction.Safety1st products are usually good,so I'm surprised that they have such a rubbish product in their line."
1,Don't waste your money,This aspirator is a complete waste of money -- it doesn't work at all. It comes apart when you try to squeeze it and you don't get any suction from it.
1,This items sucks (NOT!),This nasal aspirator is horrible! The bulb separates from the tip. You won't get any suction to clean your baby's nose. Do yourself a favor and buy a one piece aspirator or the battery operated kind.
3,Get the DVD instead and see how brilliant this man is,"Review of this CD-If you saw the DVD for Dress to Kill you will be dissapointed in the CD. The performance isn't quite as on, and the entire Tea and Cake or Death bit is misssing as is the french encore. The man is still the funniest comic I have ever come across, but the brilliance doesn't shine throughReview of Eddie Izzard-I love him. The humor is smart and clean (other than maybe 3 lines from the puberty and lost my virginity bits and swearing)The jokes aren't fed to you and he has the most original humor I've heard. He reminds me of Terry Pratchett in a wierd way. If your a fan of Discworld you'll probably enjoy Eddie Izzard. Not that the two are remotely relatedReview of Dressed to Kill in relation to other shows-On DVD, the best. It's a run through recent history branching into various hysterical tangents on everything and it's just amazing."
4,good,"Very good, though I could not find the ""French"" part, which I was expecting. I guess this is a different version from the one on Youtube."
3,Not the same show as DVD,"I just got this CD today, and I am really disappointed. I had ordered the Dress to Kill DVD and absolutely love it. But this audio recording is not from the same show. No Englebert Humperdink, no ""tea and cake or death"". Even the bits that were on there were not the same - Stone Henge, Heimlich Manouver, etc. If you had not seen the DVD, it would probably do nicely. But since I had seen it, it was just not the same."
5,So yummy!,I got these because I was craving them for awhile during my pregnancy. They are so delicious and it was fun to have a big box of them to give to nieces and nephews when they came over.
2,Pleasant to read - well translated,"Another mad race over packed with action.James Hadley chase has written some books which aren't real thrillers but adventure novels. The suspense is less effective but they are very pleasant to read. That's something in the ""Indiana Jones"" style with many twins and turns...The french translation is particularly nice. Robert Scipion, well known crosswords author, has done a translation far above the average.See more at http://jameshadleychase.free.fr"
5,Eerie and thought-provoking,"Rebecca Miller's haunting tale of a young girl driven by her religiousobsessions into a frightening world of hallucinogenic images andsuperstitious delusion. There are touching performances by the two principalgirl actors, Miranda Stuart Rhyne and Charlotte Eve Blythe. Rhyne, inparticular, is engaging as the young protagonist caught in a heavenlystruggle between good and evil to save her mentally ill mother. Sheconvincingly portrays Angela as a determined and feisty but naive andvulnerable child in equal measure; someone who is headstrong but literallyopen to abuse.There is a fine director's commentary narrated by Miller exploring thethemes and motivations that went into the making of the film."
3,Interesting concept,"The plot has an interesting concept and the acting is okay, but the story gets stalled at a couple major intersections. Worth watching when nothing else is on."
1,"Awful, but might make you think.","This is a terrible movie. Most of it was boring. But there are two things you may come out of it with. Watch your kids !! Put them first!! And what Angela says to the man at the carnival up on the balcony might be a good idea should a child get in a similar position unexpectedly. Otherwise, this movie is not worth the money or time it took for me to force myself to finish watching it. Very poorly filmed also. Keeping the yellow and all the black microphones out of the way of being filmed would be a good idea too. Extremely low budget doesn't have to mean sloppy filming."
3,Airborne Horrors Stalk Two Children,"This is a strange film in which two young girls are followed and haunted by boom mikes. These floating supernatural apparitions rarely venture far from the unfortunate children, dogging their footsteps like silent, bobbing moths of doom."
3,Slow but comforting,"There is no doubting this book is slow, not much actually happens but this is not to say it is a bad read. Slowly but surely the book progresses until you feel like a real local within the small rural Irish town.The reader,like the newbies in the town - the Ruttledges who have moved to the small Irish town from London; is made to feel welcome but there are undercurrents in the relationships and histories between the charactors of the town that you can really only grapple as you spend time with them, so by the end of the book you feel apart of the community yourself and fully appreciate the ebbs and flows, the innocence and good nature of the place. It is a written record of a small local Irish town, of a moment in time about to end.This book will not be for everybody. I must admit that I stopped and started the book many times, but I am glad in the end that I persevered and finished it."
5,Great Date Flick,"For anyone that has ever been teased in high school and dreamt of changing the outcome, this is the perfect flick for you. Drew takes to the character of Josie wonderfully. Ok, yes, so the ending is a bit cliche, but as compared to some of the more recent cruddy endings (ie Message in a Bottle, City of Angles) this movie has a refreshing POSITIVE outcome. Sometimes ""nice"" girls to finish first."
4,Drew Has Never Been Better!,"`Never Been Kissed' is a movie about a newspaper reporter Josie Geller (Drew Barrymore) that has been given her first story, to go undercover as a high school student to find out what really happens to today's teens. There is only one problem. She was a total nerd when she went to high school. `Never Been Kissed is a hilarious, wacky movie that's shows that you can always go back to high school."
2,As You Like It--not!,"In my earlier review below, I mistakenly said that this film revises Shakspeare's Taming of the Shrew. It actually revises Shakespeare's As You Like It, which is cited several times in the film. Taming is adapted as 10 things I Hate About You, with which I confused Never Been kissed."
2,Ugh!,"I'm not a mean person and I do like drew barymore, but this movie was not that good. Kinda stupid and drew did a poor acting job in the film about a reporter undercover at a local high school. And what is up with the way she looked? Drew use to be so cute when she was younger (Bad Girls, Boys on the side) She just looked very unattractive in this movie especially at the end with no make up on when she waited for him to kiss her, her eyes looked all big like cow eyes very far apart, and her nose looked like michael jackson's, and she was a little overweight in the movie too. Maybe I'm being harsh. She was pretty in 50 first dates and charlie's angels. I guess she is just the type to need alot of make up. She was hot years ago!!"
2,I didn't like this movie!,"It was okay when I first saw it in the theaters. But now that I saw it on HBO it has gotten stupid. This movie is a takeoff from 10 Things I Hate About You not to mention it's horrible. Do not rent/buy this movie it's dumb. If you want to see a good movie go rent American Pie, Outside Providence, or Rushmore. This movie's not even funny. I wouldn't recommened it!"
3,good not great,"at first the product was unreadable; then, it was okay, but the disk jump sometimes at the beginning.I won't sell it now - though I want to, because it's not in great shape."
3,REMINDED ME OF THOSE OLD 80'S HIGH SCHOOL COMEDIES,"When I watched this film, it reminded me of so many of those comedies from the 80's about high school. I thought Barrymore was good as usual and the film was pretty good for a romantic comedy. The DVD has a very good transfer."
3,OK.,This movie is about A girl named josie whowas A complete geek in her high schoolyears but when she gets A job As A under coverrepoter and to do A story about what high schoolkids do now she gets A chance to becomepopular and get her first real kiss.It was ok.
3,Josey Grossey Goes To School,"Josey,an undercover journalist,is sent back to highschool and hopes that she can be popular this time around.Drew Barrymore is a true actress,different in every movie,perfect in every character she portrays.Watch it to see a great actress,or a fun and heartwarming movie.(I have given this flick only 3 stars because I don't actually like high school movies)."
3,Pleasant,"Entertaining ""what-if"" story starring Drew Barrymore as Josie, a 25-year-old would-be reporter who gets a chance to relive her high school days. With the help of her younger brother she manages get in with the popular crowd and not be such a geek this time. Of course, in the end she figures out that hanging with the popular kids is not where she really wanted to be after all.It's true that there are cliche characters and the whole thing is rather unbelievable. One BIG problem with the plot is that Josie went to college but has still never been kissed--huh? No matter how geeky one might be in high school, things change when you get to college. She surely would have met guys to date in college.Nonetheless, it's a charming, light movie, especially recommended for Barrymore's performance."
4,It's very very funny!,"I've never thought of Drew Barrymore as a particulary good actress, but in this movie she proves me wrong, and plays a fantastic, charming and embarrasing character. I can't remember the last time a movie made me laugh so hard. You gotta see the scene where she goes wild at latin concert, it's 1st class comedy! An ordinary, but very watchable film!"
1,Never Should Have Been Made!,"I completely agree with the Amazon.com review of Never Been Kissed. This formulaic garbage represents everything that is wrong with Hollywood movies: flat performances and in your face schmaltz. Save your money and buy a movie with substance and legitimate ACTING, not this junk."
1,One of the most boring and stupid movies,"It's just a waist of time.The plot is obvious from the very beginning, the action (what action???) is one of the slowest ever, characters are so exaggerated that they are unrealistic in anything they do, and the movie itself gives a wrong impression that american teenagers are just a bunch of silly girls and stupid guys.DO NOT WATCH THIS. IT'S ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES EVER."
5,Quite Cute,"What more do you need to know than it is a cute movie, it might be predictible, but it's good. Yes you know that Barrymore is not going to be hung out to dry, this isn't an action suspence movie. It is a very cute romance movie. I think Barrymore did a good job, and Michael Vartan the teacher is so hot. What a gorgeus guy he could get anyone to go to school, regardless of their age! This is a very nice romance movie, that will make you laugh a little too. Michael Vartan is VERY cute too."
4,this movie was cool,i thought it was funny and cute and i cried at the end i would say why i cried but that would ruin the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it.i think drew barrymore was better in ever after.
4,"Film snobs, stay away","Otherwise, this is a good movie to watch. The storyline is a tad trite and predictable, but it's nevertheless cute and full of heart. The performances are all good -- Drew Barrymore, who would not be the first person in mind to play a former geek, pulls it off with surprising honesty and makes us utterly sympathetic to her character. David Arquette is quite funny as her younger, cooler brother. And Michael Vartan does a great job making us see the teacher's inner conflict about feeling attracted to a student (and, yeah, he's really hot). Basically, if you're looking for a fun way to pass an hour and a half, this is the way to do it."
3,Got what I paid for,"Although the cover was slightly sunwashed, the movie itself was in good condition, so no complaints because I got it for a fairly decent price."
1,Only OK if you're under 15,"This is one of the silliest (in the worst possible sense), weakest, over-acted, full-with-cliches vehicle (you may call this one a Yugo!)I have seen in my life. The only emotion it brings is anger for wasting your time. Please don't bother with this one."
1,not very good,"This movie definitly isn't realistic. I mean, come on: a 25 year old who's ""never really kissed a boy""? And I can't even BEGIN to describe how extremely obvious it is that all the actors (including Drew) are trying WAY too hard in their roles. Overall, I found this movie to be very cheesy & predictable."
2,an okay movie at best,"sure this movie was cute, but it must have been one of the dumbest films I've ever seen. David Arquette is the best thing about it. that's a little sad. Wow the cool kids and the uncool nerds...there are more people in the school than those types of people. The ending was sort of dumb too, it just seemed unethical...the actors do try however and at times this movie can be funny but at most times it is cheesy."
1,Not a keeper,"This one is definetly not a keeper. I would suggest that you rent it only if you want to see an overweight Drew Barrymore, unless of course you want to keep a permanent copy of the weight factor for your records. It is a terrible story and very poor acting with bad dialogue, nothing really good about this movie."
3,It's All About Being Yourself,"I've seen this movie twice and there's one word to describe it: SILLY! Drew Barrymore is way too pretty to play a geek but she did a descent job as Josie Gellar, a former geek who goes back to high school to get a story about today's teens but then she relives her horrible days all over again. I laughed during several scenes especially the night at the reggae club and the peguin/banana/condom scene. David Arquette was so funny as her brother who helps her become popular and Molly Shannon was terrific too. The message you learn at the end of the movie is obvious: Being cool is all about being yourself! I did like the speech at the prom and the kiss on the baseball mound. All in all, this movie was all right and the ending was the best part of all."
3,okay,the case was not in the best condition but it was okay. the movie played perfectly and there were no scratches on the dvd.
4,Never been kissed,"Good romance, comedy movie, me and my daughter just love watching this together. Recommend this one. Great performance by Drew Barrymore one of her best."
5,Never Been Kissed has never been greater!,"At first, I thought that this movie would be very bad, compared to other Drew Barrymore movies. When my sister and I saw Never Been Kissed on HBO, I knew that my prediction was totally wrong. As a fan of romantic comedy, I found it very enjoyable. Drew stars as Josie Geller, and is a reporter for a newspaper. She disguises herself as a seventeen-year-old to see how high school kids are acting these days. She makes friends with the popular girls and is soon the most popular girl in high school. Drew's nerdy friend was played by Leelee Sobieski, a great actress. This is a movie that teaches a very important lesson."
5,Never Been Kissed (she should have been) :x,The movie was very funny... It made me realize how mean high schoolers could be... other than that though it was a great movie and I encouage you to all go see it...
1,Only for tasteless teens or easily-amused adults,"I have no idea why this film has been so adored by the general public. Drew Barrymore has once again proven that she can't act. I'm sorry, I don't care if she's adorable, that doesn't mean she can act. The movie, like most teen movies, was filled to the brim with cliches, bad writing, and horrible acting. Leelee Sobieski, WHY would you choose a movie that could prove to be so rancorous to your career? Please, keep Drew Barrymore off the big screen."
3,Never Been Kissed,dvd was in ok condition few light scratches on back of dvd. dvd cover sheet was a little dirty but not bad.
2,This movie was a HUGE disappointment,"This is a HORRIBLE movie! The main character dreams of becoming a journalist and one day she gets the opportunity to go undercover at a local high school and report on what's going on with modern teenagers in America.She is HORRIBLY unprepared for this assignment! Despite the fact that she's undercover, she uses her REAL NAME! She also failed to develop a cover story and was forced to make one up on the spot when one of her teachers told her to tell the class something about herself. She did a HORRIBLE job of improvising a cover story and the whole movie is just one awkward, humiliating situation after another.The only really likeable characters in the whole movie are some teenage math nerds that call themselves the denominators.Seriously, do NOT waste your time with this movie! 99% of it is PAINFUL to watch and the other 1% doesn't make up for the pain."
5,set back eat popcorn and enjoy a great movie,this movie is great! it has a great polt buy it it is worth it
3,"Not great, but worth watching","I saw this movie about the time of the Columbine shootings, and was struck at some of the things it would have had to say if.....It is a bit hard to believe at points (Drew Barrymore as an outsider for instance), but I didn't find it hard to get past that to another lesson that we, of a certain age, tend to forget, namely that high school can be tough if you don't fit in, and most of us don't make it any easier.There are some scenes that stick with you, especially the 'geeks' finding a way to make it through. If only it always worked out as well in real life."
3,"It's dumb, but somehow it works","Never Been Kissed is a sloppily plotted, unevenly acted, and often trite movie, sometimes almost unbearably uncomfortable to watch and filled with moments to make you wince, and yet, somehow, magically, and all thanks to Drew Barrymore, it works. I'm not even a fan of Drew Barrymore, but after the first half hour of the movie, her convincing and engaging performance made me completely forget the plot holes, one-dimensional supporting characters, unbelievable and yet completely predictable plot twists, and wasted conflict opportunities; by the end of the movie, I was rooting for her character all the way. It's a strange movie, uneven and illogical, but I ended up enjoying it enough to buy the DVD. Despite the multitude of problems, this is an entertaining and satisfying comedy."
4,Pretty Good,"I don't agree with the official Amazon reviewer -- I totally buy Drew Barrymore as a geek. We only know she's not because we've seen her grow up all wild and out of control, but if she'd had a normal life.... High schoolers would have eaten her alive just like the rest of us. Have you noticed how huge her chin is?The movie was a little cliché, a little cheesy here and there (that whole speech at the beginning before her friend says, ""Girl, you are a writer!"" is so cloying! Drives me nuts...) and the humor was exaggerated (the Barbies at the prom). But none of it was enough to keep me from liking it, or from identifying here and there. (The all-humiliation network? Dude, that was my high school career!)Never Been Kissed is obviously a fluff movie, but it's a damn good one and I was consistently entertained. I think it's a sweet and worthy project of butterfly-Drew."
5,Fun filled Romance,This movie is a great movie. I love Drew Barrymore and Michael Vartan in this movie. It is fun to watch them together and all the zany things a misfit goes through when going back to high school.
5,Great Movie,"If you like happy ever after, this is a great movie. Drew Barrymore is a wonderful fit. Received it very quickly after ordering. Very satisfied."
2,Not Very Interesting.,"This wasn't one of the best films that I've seen. It fluctuated in how interesting it was. The acting was fine, it just seemed that the plot was a bit weak and the movie was not very captivating or original. There was one or two funny scenes. I actually give this film 2.5 stars."
1,"One of the worst romantic comedies, ever.","If I had to talk about this film's flaws it would take for ever.Everything is so unoriginal, so corny, so cliched. Drew Barrymore streches the boundaries of bad acting here. Her character is not believable, the screenplay is so dumb.If you are a 12 or 13 year old girl, go see it, if not, stay away..."
3,Not impressed,"The used product I ordered was described as ""Like New"", but when I received the DVD, the case was crushed in the packaging and the DVD itself was very scratched up."
3,"Not bad, but not good","Somehow this movie seems as if it was written in the 80s...its a bit old-fashioned for a romantic-comedy made in the late 90s...anyways...Barrymore plays a copy editor, who gets her first chance to write a story as a reporter. But for that, the 25-year-old needs to go back to high schools and pretend that she was 17. Yup, this sounds not very believable. Thats one big minus.Some of the jokes are really nice and make you laugh, but sometimes ""Never Been Kissed"" drifts off into dumb slapstick comedy.All in all, this movie is worth watching. You wont want to buy it on DVD, but youll have a funny time. The performances- especially by Leelee Sobieski as nerdy girl and Michael Vartan- are very good. Barrymore is a bit too annoying for my taste and David Arquette is totally wasted in this one."
3,A cute story...,"Never Been Kissed was a cute story. I guess you need to be in the right mood for this ""chick flick"" which even my husband seemed to be enjoying. josie geller gets her chance, not only to get a story of her own, but a chance to go back to high school and hope it's a better experience than the original. She was treated so cruelly! I thought it was junior high that was the cruel stage of school? anyway, she goes back to high school, undercover for her story, and falls in love with the english teacher, befriends Leelee Sobieksi, who i thought was great in her role, and becomes popular, just what she always wanted. it has a cute, happy ending which made me cry... it's a light, comedic romance that will have you smiling."
3,Never Been Kissed (1999),"Josie goes back to high school to write a story for the newspaper about high school today. Josie, a former high school nerd, longs to fit in with the popular crowd instead of the group of intelligent nerdy types that befriend her. Her brother Rob also returns to school and helps Josie become popular. Nothing here that we haven't seen before in countless other teen comedies. A good cast makes this a fairly enjoyable film."
5,Unmissable Entertainment.,"Drew Barrymore is back better than ever - as Josie a news reporter who goes back to school to do a really article for the Sunday Times Newspaper who she works for. But, its not all easy, as Josie remembers her terrible high school past and it returns her - but can she be cool this time? Also starring David Arquette (Scream, Dreams With the Fishes, Scream 2) and Leelee Sobieski (Joan Of Arc, Deep Impact).A teenage girl or boy should not miss this - its a must see!"
4,good movie to see,i think that the movie never been kissed was good and because i am a big drew barrymore fan.i watch the movie 3 times before i returned it.i also would recommened it to anyone that hasnt see it.
4,Cute movie,"If you like Drew Barrymore, you will like this movie. I'm not a particular fan of her, but she did a good job in this film. The story itself is also nice, and honestly, how many of us wish that we had a chance to do over our school years? Not everyone will like this film since it's a 'chick flick', but for those who enjoy films such as this, give this a try. I found the ending a bit cliched, but it's still a nice movie."
1,Too much cultural studies,"I disagree with the other reviewer who praised this book for, among other things, its historical accuracy. This book has no claims to contribute to historical studies at all. It is a work in cultural studies, and shows all of the characteristics of that genre - obscure language, complex theories, loose historical claims, and a confusion between fictional and non-fictional sources. Obviously the analysis of fiction and non-fiction, together, is essential to the argument of the author, but as no attempt at historical or even literary context is attempted, one is left with a series of under-argued observations."
1,Insubstantial...,"This is the worst example of cultural studies. The book is full of vague, insubstantiated claims, tenuous theoretical and historical connections, sweeping generalizations, and marred by a fatal lack of basic organization. Cultural studies doesn't have to be this simplistic and thin. Each chapter reads like a series of promises (""I will deal with this issue later in this chapter"") that remain unfulfilled, as though the writer couldn't actually deliver on the task of real analysis, but can only give vague and hollow summary. Avoid it."
5,A refreshing exercise!,"This is probably the best introduction to the 'Way of Tea' - in English sources. While it recognises all the virtues associated with 'cha no yu' in its more celebrated or well known forms (e.g. Ura-senke etc.), it brings fresh emphasis to the spiritual dimensions of 'tea' - reminding us that cha-no-yu was inspired by - and went with, a Buddhist feeling for the totality of life, compressed - if you like, into the magic of the momentary. This is the 'Way of tea' you can enjoy in your own space (less space). Hirota-sensei isn't taking issue with the best representatives of cha-no-yu in Japan. Hisamatsu Shinichi, a well known author on Japanese culture, endeavoured to say similar things to a Japanese audience. It is not the formal requirements, but the spiritual requirements, which should be satisfied."
4,good for the hardcore tea nerd / buddhist,"This is a good historical overview of the way of tea and its relationship to Buddhism, both Zen and Pure Land. It's an interesting, if not totally compelling, read. Frankly it is a bit dry and the writing doesn't really sparkle in terms of ideas or style.It is also the only place you are going to find the Zen Tea Record of Jakuan Sotaku in English, and that alone is worth the price of admission, if you're the sort of person who cares about such things."
1,Very poor quality.,This video is poor quality. No instruction given. Instructor is shaky in balancing postures. Sequence is correct but timing is bad. Production and sound quality is cheap and cheesy. Many better Ashtanga videos out there.
1,Rubbish,Its not a good yoga DVD. I can think of a hundred other yoga teachers Id choose before Id even think of choosing this one
1,Power to the people?,"Haha, this movie was a joke right?! OK, if not it's pretty darn foolish. You have the dead looking for revenge thing and it just doesn't work. The degrees of scare and gore are taken over by jokes that AREN'T laugh worthy and worthless nudity. I'd recommend Dead Mary instead."
2,"""not bad, but definately not good""","This nonsensical fairy tale had plenty of eye candy, and not much else. The script just doesn't make any sense at all, and the acting....if you can call it that, is sub par at best...I've seen better acting from those Bowflex Infomericals......what a mess!"
1,Bloody Awful,"Terrible, just terrible. If you even need me to go into detail about how awful this movie is, then you've got too much time on your hands. I'm not wasting my time.Thumbs way down."
3,Not Great but Not Bad,I've seen worse horror movies; you can tell it's a straight to video release just on the acting skills alone but it's still not a completely horrible movie.
3,Decent,"Anther find in a local stores bargain bin. Sounded like a good film, I viewed the trailer on You Tube and it looked really good. It starts off pretty good but just falls into cliche after looking promising. The kills were decent but one was straight from Final Destination 3 or vice versa. The ending made me go what the f*&( was that?Overall, decent film but you wont remember it after you watch it. Probably the worst ending ive ever seen in horror films."
3,Not bad! It actually manages to be an impresseve straight-to-video horror movie!,"Urban Legends: Bloody Mary is the third entry to the Urban Legend Series. Mary Banner was killed by a prank later on in the late 50's or early 60's, and then the prankers hide her body in a box on Prom Night. Then years later on, the pranker's teenaged children are getting killed off one by one, in Urban Legendy Ways. This movie is scary - it has it's moments. Awsome special effects - can't hate it. And good acting - not something you see now and days at the straight-to-video section.It worth the three stars, it stands strong and clear. It's better than the first two Urban Legends, more terrifying and not a killer flick - a ghost flick. A girl named Heather gets mirror shards stuck in her head, and she pulls it off - WOW, that's cool special effects - this movie should get an award. This movie is okay, for it's category. I recomend it."
4,Not bad at all,My girlfriend and I enjoyed this movie. We didn't think it was bad considering the negative reviews. It was better than # 2. Rent first if your worried. Just think of it as a good horror movie and not a sequel (kind of like Halloween 3). Also if your scared of spiders DO NOT WATCH.
2,bloody mary,"I love horror movies and I have to admit, Bloody Mary is an urban legend that always terrified me. So I had to see this movie.Honestly, it was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It was so cheesy and the acting was absolutly terrible. I don't know if I have ever laughed so hard.So even though I got a good laugh I was extremely disappointed. I was really looking forward to a good horror movie."
1,huh?,"I guess I'm running out of videos to rent at Blockbuster. Bloody Mary was a teenage movie that had really nothing to do with the Bloody Mary urban legend. The three teenage girls at the slumber party may have tried to conjure up ""Bloody Mary,"" but what they got was the ghost of another Mary that died in 1969. Besides the bad special effects and acting, a lot of it didn't make any sense or connect. It left me wondering, what does one thing have to do with another?It was funny though. In one scene a guy get suffocated to death with some flimsy plastic. I would have just ripped a hole through the plastic bag so I can breathe!"
3,Mediocre,"UL3 is a gore feast that lacks on the brain. It's not smart and you'll know the ending half way through. An ok attempt, but it could've had more."
4,Good Installment In The Series,"First you will notice a review stating that this movie stole it's theme from Candyman, actually the Urban Legend of Bloody Mary has been around a lot longer, as most people will recall.Aside from that, this movie is strong from start to finish. While any slasher/teen horror flick will be predictible, this movie feels more thought out than the other 2 in this series.the story follows a legend based in the 60's, where a girl dies during prom night after a prank goes wrong.Mary has awoken thanks to the chant and the prank that's awfully similar to the one that happened over thirty-years ago. Mary Lambert, who did Pet Semetary directs, which helped this film a lot."
4,Bloody Mary Review,This movie was pretty darn scary. It's a movie that you'll want to watch on one of those dark stormy nights with a bunch of friends. The special effects are phenominal and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. I recommend anyone who loves horror movies to watch it!
2,Bloody No Good.....,"This movie is by far the worse of the Urban Legends movies. This is another movie I purchased without renting it first. Had I rented it first, I would not have bought this movie even though I did save money by buying it previously viewed. A group of high school friends start talking about the legend of Bloody Mary. Chanting her name will make her rise from the dead! Oh Boy. The whole movie boils down to the fact that Mary was murdered many years ago and her body put away where no one would ever find it. When Mary comes back to life, she seeks revenge on fellow classmates and kills them off. Not a good horror movie. No gore, no suspense. I would definetly recommend anyone rent this movie before buying it!"
2,Dumb movie,"This movie has nothing to do with the original Bloody Mary story, it had nothing to do with saying her name in the mirror, and when you say her name three times she doesn't kill you, but kills the children of the people that killed her.Well, the movie starts out 3 girls at a slumber party telling the story of Bloody Marry. Later one girl says Bloody Marry 3 times just joking around and awakens the spirt of Bloody Marry.Soon after she said Bloody Marry 3 times, day after day the childern of the people that killed her start dieing. One girl died by poping a huge zit and hundreds of bugs start pouring out of the zit!"
4,"works great, but has one flaw","I love having a dual coffee maker! It's great to be able to make two pots of coffee at once. A real time saver for me! I like flavored coffee and my husband has his columbian and now I can make both easily.The only flaw this item has is that there's no auto shut-off. I have to remember to turn it off. I have even had to drive back home to check it!? I didn't realize any pots were made without this important safety feature...But, other than that, I'm happy with the machine!"
4,Great Product - Great Price,I love this coffeemaker = the capability of making two pots of coffee at the same time. What a time-saver. it is definitely worth the money. The only drawback is that I have to be careful when serving regular and decaf (the pots are the same). My suggestion is adding a different color lid.
4,Great for decaf/caf households.,"We had this in white with a different brand on the front. We wore it out, and found the black thru this company. We love this coffee maker because we drink caf and decaf. I like the black better cuz it shows less coffee staining."
1,Good Intentions,The item arrived broken. I was very depressed because this is an excellent item. The seller was very prompt in returning the funds.
5,Great Picture,"I bought this player because of the video features (3:2 pulldown, progressive scan) and the reasonable price. I have it hooked up to a Sony 51"" 16:9 television and a 5.1 sound system. Using the optical sound output and component video out I get great video and audio. Monsters Inc. and Toy Story 2 look absolutely incredible. It has yet to skip even once on the 25 or so movies I've played on it so far. The remote has some nice features as well. You can switch audio options (5.1, 2.0, commentary, languages) on the fly as well as the angle and subtitles. I don't use it for mp3's or vcd's since I play them on my PC instead. I would highly recommend this player."
2,Not good for mp3 audio,"I bought the SD3800 to upgrade from my older DVD player. I specifically picked this one because it had VCD, JPEG, and MP3 compatibility. Sadly, the MP3 portion is a joke. Despite following all of Toshiba's restrictive compatibility requirements (ISO9660 Level 1, 8-character file names only, etc.), it will only play a few songs and then stop. It does not use the M3U playlist and will not play all the songs in a directory, much less the whole disk.The only positive thing about purchasing this unit is that the VCD and JPEG aspects seem to work okay, albeit very slow."
4,Great - Irish contemporary music,My Grandmother sent me a tape of this 5 years ago from Dublin. I lost it two years ago and have been looking for it ever since. The songs are stuck in my head and I love them. Give it a try!
5,Uncovering family history on Amazon,"I knew a Dr. Morwitz when I was a child. We had a family story about his flight from Germany, and I was curious about its accuracy. After some research, I found out about this research report at UNC, and wanted to see it. Surprising to me, Amazon, through its network of booksellers, located the report and handled the order through its common interface process. The book arrived when promised, in good condition and at the agreed-upon price. Thanks, Amazon, for supporting print materials from academic sources."
2,Sharing between 2 PCs doesn't work,"We have 2 PCs networked via a household wireless network, and have for years used Lotus Organizer on one of the PCs to keep our joint calendar. The functions of AnyTime Organizer are fine for us compared with Lotus Organizer, but we bought the product specifically because the calendar was supposed to be sharable between 2 PCs. This function works very poorly, with many error messages, hang-ups and program failures."
1,Not Good for Organizer Users,"If you are a Lotus Organizer user wishing to move to something more current, DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE. Their webpage advertises that Anytime can ""seamlessly"" import your Organizer data. First, I don't agree that having to export from Organizer to an intermediate .csv file which Anytime reads meets the definition of ""seamlessly"". But the real insult is that Anytime crashes when attempting to import either the exported Organizer Contacts or Events information. It's fairly clear the ""seamless"" operation was never tested before releasing the product.Extended e-mail conversations with Anytime support proved less than helpful. This may be a good program if you are starting fresh, but if you have extensive Organizer Contacts and Events information you wish to maintain I'd suggest you look elsewhere."
1,unorganized,"I bought this prog in hopes of converting lotus notes files to outlook and it did not work at all.Also, the anytime Earth Clock that is included in the bundle is 3 minutes fast.Geeze, can't even get the right time of day."
1,Lousy product,"I bought this program to use as an address book. I would recommend that you retain your paper address book, as it's difficult to impossible to operate. This program is user hostile. Find something else."
1,Massive disappointment,"Lou Brock was my idol, and he deserves much better than this scattered, cursory glance at his life. I blame his co-author, who must have been responsible for some of the idiotic, neo-literate, pseudo-cool prose that irritates instead of informing. Someone someday will write the proper story of the 1960s Cardinals. In the meantime, David Halberstam's _October 1964_ is a far more satisfying look at Lou Brock, and you get the remainder of the Yankees and Cardinals as a bonus!"
3,Not Great But No Cardinal Sin,"While I admit the prose could be a bit ""artsy"", the author, after all, was an art critic.Still, I found this a quick and enjoyable read. As one would expect, the focus was on Brock's unparalleled World Series performances and on his record-breaking 1974 season. I would have liked a bit more ""filler"" between those career highpoints."
2,I thought the book wasn't that interesting,I felt that the writer could have done more with the characters and storyline of the book. I also did not like the way the chapter's were split up into the character's thoughts instead of flowing together. It took me a while to finish the book because no part really gripped me. I just finished it to find out what happened in the end although I should've just read the last chapters. I honestly don't think this book was worth the time I spent to read it.
2,????,"This was not a thick book but for some reason it took me several weeks to complete. One of the reasons I did complete this book is because I try to finish what I begin... I felt the author was trying to write like the voice of a man.. Many times during the story I found myself wondering do men really talk like that? Perhaps they do? There was not much of a plot and over all it was not a terrible book,just not all that exciting... I love to read but this was not one of the best books that I have ever read."
4,BETCHA can't put this one down,"I read this book in one day. It was quick reading for me. I liked the characters, they were easy to relate with. I also liked how she split up the characters voices by chapters which takes real talent to write that way. I really liked the characters and laughed with them, cried with them, rejoiced with them. I could see both sides of the situations too - from the sistahs to the brotahs.So, if you want a light read, and something good. Pick this one up, and i guarantee you won't want to put it down when you're finished."
1,Yuck!,"This book made me sick to my stomach. How a woman like Sandy could be so dumb & desperate is beyond me. What sane woman would put up with this type of junk? The characters were not well developed & the ending was dumb. Sandy should have dumped T.J. & kept rolling. But no, her desperate behind just had to anything just to keep a man in her corner."
4,Pretty Good Read,"This book was pretty good. I just wanted to tell Sandy to stop being so stuffy. I was glad when she finally stuck up for herself. As for T.J., he was just too stuck on himself. I couldn't believe how he tried to rationalize what he did. Now, Speed was a trip and needed to stop trying to be young and stop encouraging his son (TJ) to be a player. He was funny, though. Bebe was a pretty down to earth person. I just wished the author had given her character more structure (for lack of a better word) so that we can see more of her as opposed to seeing her as a support system for Sandy. I do applaude her for going back to school. It is never too late to educate yourself. All in all, I will definitely recommend this book for its spurts of drama and funny scenes."
3,"He Say, She Say -- Nothing to run out and buy","This was my first time reading Yolanda Joe's work. Although, the book was entertaining to say the least. The lack of a plot caused the book to be somewhat choppy. I think Speed's character was revealed more after he experienced a heart attack. I would not recommend buying this one. Keep trying Ms. Joe."
3,Men have it rough,"An amusing read that kept me turning the pages. A little on the male bashing side, but I got some good laughs from beginning to end."
1,Where's the substance?,After reading other reviews I ordered this book thinking that it would be well worth my time. Big Mistake! It was very shallow and very low on substance! The relationship between T.J. and Sandy was not a relationship. It was just sex. I guess I was looking for something deeper in the book. It was just about a sexual relationship and getting childish revenge.
3,Quick and Cute,"This was my first time reading a book by Yolanda Joe. I thought it was pretty much an overall good book. Nothing about it really stood out, but I must say that it was quick, it was cute, and I smiled at the end. What else really matters?"
2,The complexity of the book hides the simplicity of XPath,"O'Reilly books are usually a good choice for a professional to learn a concept in an effective way. However, this book is an exception. If you think XPath looks difficult, it is just because this book makes it _seem_ difficult. Read the official W3C specifikation instead and you will see how simple XPath really is.The book incorporates a lot of discussions about XPath but they really get in the way of XPath, beeing presented the way they are. It would have been more effective if the book explained XPath just by including the 30 pages of XPath specification, and instead focused not on explaing, but on discussing aspects.My main point is that you learn to use, as well as master, XPath an order of magnitude faster by reading the specification than by reading this book."
3,Fine reference but covered in other books,"This is a relatively short book on XPath and, as one of the other reviews points out, it tends to complicate what is generally a fairly simple standard. The XPath portion of the XSLT : Programmer's Reference from Michael Kay is more succinct covers the important parts in enough detail to get the job done."
5,Recommended,I have viewed all of this series and found it to be very eye-opening and facinating. You must be alert when listening to this science team. Remarkable material.
4,Bought for others.,Needed for school so I bought it and had it shipped to them. Prime member and they had it in 2 days.
3,La belle Helene,"Too much talk,, thank you for editing,but you got to be good at it, tipical Operetta Offenbach.."
5,Book for the start,"This is a good book for someone who want to start exploring a history of Serbs, and gives you a basic information about people, culture and political and social history. For others this is a book you realy need for personal library."
5,A wonderful romance,"This is the first book of Julie Beard's that I have read.I picked it up at the store because it sounded interesting, and I had never read anything by her.Once I opened it I couldn't put it down.It has a good storyline.Actually more than one.The way Beard ties Mrs.Plumshaw's and Uncle Teddy's romance in right along with Caroline's and Lucas's is wonderful.The ghost of Barrett Hamilton is a good twist to it.It was fun to watch Lucas be transformed from a criminal to a Lord.And the fact that it takes place in medieval times makes it more intriguing and mysterious.It's as if you can feel the characters come to life right in front of you.A job well done on Mrs. Beard's part.Keep the novels coming!"
3,Generalisation of How Real Negotiations Work,"Barney Zick provides an easy read, and highlights the issues one faces during negotiations, namely:1. Negotiating with yourself;2. Don't know when to walk away; and3. Not asking for something in return when concedingUnfortunately, the author does not elaborate further how these principles can be further utilised to one's benefit, especially the chapter on ""When You Can't Afford to Walk Away"", a better read will beThe New Successful Large Account Management: Maintaining and Growing Your Most Important Assets -- Your Customerswhere it clearly illustrates how you can persuade other influencers in your negotiation process, change the payoffs, and emerge a winner."
5,Enjoyable,"This is the first book that I've read by Pamela Burford. I was a little skeptical about starting a new author, but I actually enjoyed it.Raven Muldoon needs a husband by the age of thirty or she'll be matchmake by her friends. At first she have her eyes set on Brent Radley...until she met his brother-Hunter. The problem is Hunter would not steal his brother's woman...but Raven have a plan to get her man!"
4,"Great Brahms, Rare Mendelssohn","This title from the ""Masters of the Violin"" series on Classica D'Oro/Allegro features terrific performances of the Brahms and Mendelssohn Violin Concertos by the great David Oistrakh with Kiril Kondrashin conducting the USSR Symphony Orchestra. The sound however is less than desirable as these are mono recordings from 1949 (Mendelssohn) and 1950 (Brahms). If you want to hear Oistrakh tackle the Brahms VC in stereo, there is a live recording with Kondrashin from 1963, available on RCA's ""The Essential David Oistrakh."" Or, there are his two recordings for EMI, one with Otto Klemperer from 1960 and the other with George Szell from 1969 (see my review of the latter). However, performances of Oistrakh doing the Mendelssohn are rarer, and this is the best currently available to my knowledge."
4,Virtues to avoid,"Although well written, and probably realistic, I find the outpourings of Machiavelli leave me a little cold. From his anecdote that men should be flattered or eliminated, to his advice on whether to be loved or feared, the reader is left with the feeling that men who live by these virtues should most definitely be avoided."
3,"The Item is fine, I ordered the wrong version",Everything came on time and in good condition. I just ordered the wrong edition.
4,"Panasonic TC-15LT1 15"" Widescreen TV @ Bytesector.com","Small, slim, and sensational; those are the three key words that describe Panasonic's 15"" LCD Television known as TC-15LT1. This LCD TV is small yet has a fair bit to offer; it supports 16:9 as well as 4:3 display aspect ratios, has a built-in 181 channel tuner, progressive cinema scan, and much more. Today we will explore this 15"" widescreen LCD TV's features and functions and explain why sometimes the smaller things in life remain dominant......full review at Bytesector.com"
2,too much maths...,The book is full of formuales.it does not build concepts by starting from the simple and then moving to more complex topics.a lot of the derivations are left unfinished to be worked out by the reader.Not a book I would recommend for a beginner.I really wish they had a lot more solved examples..
4,Much better than cloth oven mitts!,"These are great! You can put them in the dishwasher to wash them, too (top rack). Easy clean up! I prefer the contoured style as it is less bulky. These may not withstand as much heat as those big rubbery kind, but they work quite nicely for me. These do not put your hands in the awkward position like those big rubbery kind."
4,Solid all around for the price,"It's stylish and sound good enough, button on the remote a little bit confuse, and the digital volume control is bad one, reception of the antenna not as good as the other brands. Mp3 playback is good, even put mp3s in folders, some other brands dont."
3,Doesn't cut it,"This album, just like Swalati was also recorded and produced in South Africa with the help of South African musicians and engineers mostly. Perhaps that's why it just doesn't cut it unlike most of Kanda's previous works and leaves a whole lot to be desired. I would recommend Kanda's previous works or one of his 'Best Of' albums instead of this one."
4,A wake-up call for business leaders!!,"Bob Critchley's book provides a powerful and compelling argument for ""thinking outside the box"".The population demographics are inevitable and organisations ignore them at their own peril.Unless organisations adopt flexible ways of engaging employees and think laterally about how to maximise the contribution of every single employee, they are doomed to become victims of the demographic reality.Critchley's book not only provides the evidence and demonstrates the inevitibility - but he also provides a compendium of ideas about how to respond.An invaluable guide to any forward thinking HR professional."
3,"eh, mostly does what I ask","For playing DVDs, and vcr tapes, it mostly does what I ask.Biggest gripe is no manual tracking. It is supposed to be automatic, but several tapes I have from other vcrs get sqiggly to the point of being unwatchable.Setting up the maching to record is not intuitive IMO. You need to steer around with the play, stop, rew buttons, even though there are arrow buttons elsewhere on the remote. Also you cannot enter dates and times with the number buttons, you must steer around with the play, ff, rew, and stop buttons--very odd in my book. Also you need to physically hit a button on the machine to finalize the timed record process. Why??The remote seems very dead. You really have to point at the unit to get it to work.So far it continues to work, after 6 months. Picture quality meets my standards, though I don't ask for much.So I give it an eh. I'm sure you can find better, but for the most part, it does what I ask it to do."
2,"Just passable on analog TV, not good on digital.","Recently hooked this up via Component cable to my 42"" plasma HDTV for DVD playback. The bottom quarter of the picture is noticably fuzzy compared to the rest of the picture, especially for text. Definitely cheap junk, but can't afford a new progressive scan one yet. Picture was fine via composite or s-video to an analog tv. VHS side seems flimsy and tends to make weird scary noises during fast forward or reverse. Don't really trust it not to eat my tapes!!"
5,Destined to become a classic;every line is poetry!,"Some might label this ""regional"" or ""Appalachian"" literature but the quality of the writing and the unique vision of Lou Crabtree allows it to soar to much greater heights. These stories belong on your bookshelf alone side Chekhov, being among the finest stories crafted by the human heart. They have a small but growing cult of readers now. Someday they will be a part of our literature. A Classic."
3,SWEET HOLLOW,"BASED ON HER ACCOUNT OF APPALACHIAN STORIES THAT ARE SO DEEP THAT I WOULD THINK YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A DEGREE TO UNDERSTAND THIS READ BUT HEY IF YOU HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO THAN I WOULD SAY KNOCK YOURSELF OUT,THANKS HER FRIEND IN ABINGDON VA"
2,"Skip it, buy Let it Be instead.....","In fact, buy Pleased to Meet Me and Tim before you buy this one. I really don't know why this is an essential recording! It's just a bunch of one dementional punk rock songs. Weak is the word that I would use to describe it. If you want to know why the Replacements are revered, check out the albums I just mentioned. The Mats are really an awesome band, this just isn't there best."
5,Remley's scholarship is characteristically brilliant,"Paul Remley's scholarship in this work is characteristically brilliant. Cannot recommend it highly enough, even at the eighty-dollar ticket price."
4,I can play this one completely and enjoy every song.,"I like to listen to this one when I am in a calm mood or cleaning, doing laundry, etc. This music is unlike the music I normally like (Puddle of Mudd, Shinedown, etc), but I really like this CD. Don't know why. There is no ""bad"" song on this one."
4,INSIGHTFUL! A FINE REVISION TEXT,"One of the most attractive qualities of this book is how it managed to maintain its insight in both adiabatic and non-adiabatic phenomena. Its computational perspective indicates the need for aspiring users to have basic knowledge of Physical Chemistry.As was manifested by it contents, this book is an upper-level undergraduate text, which furnishes its reader with the fundamentals of Quantum Mechanics. It brushed across a wide range of topics, and did a good job in explaining the kinetics of: Chemical Equilibra, Spectroscopy, Atomic/Molecular Transitions, and Computational techniques.The book's scope is summarized, but wide enough. It has depth. However, some of the most recent advances in Quantum Chemistry are missing in it. Overall, I would say that this text is a fine compendium, which should serve as a notebook-alternative. Better reserved for revisions!"
4,Excellent book but who are in the pictures?,"I couldn't put this book down. It's one thing to look at the Native American culture overall, but this book about the women's perspective takes things to another level. And, as with most books about the Native Americans, it can be heart wrenching to read how their way of life and their families suffered from being ""made civilized.""Having grown up in a white culture where women who are not young, beautiful and thin are considered to be of lesser, if not little value, it was comforting to read about a culture that not only valued women, but who particularly valued older women. The whites could learn much.The only reason I gave this book 4 stars was because none of the numerous pictures throughout the book had captions. You didn't know if the people pictured were related to the woman telling the story, or if it was her herself. Steve Wall left a huge hole by not providing insight people he pictured. Other than that, I thought this was an excellent book."
1,Less entertainment for same amount of money.,"Note.....Earlier seasons gave us 800 minutes on 4 discs. This season is on 3 discs, 300 minutes (500 minutes ""less"") coverage/entertainment and yet the price is still the same or higher.Studio starting to get greedy."
4,"good show, poor DVD","PR7 is just great, in my opion, it is the best since season 4 (no one can beat talented Christian, ever). There are so many positives: many great designers, back to NY, Nina and Kors were there almost all the time, no stupid drama, interesting challenges.I give 4 star instead of 5 mainly because the DVD content, it lack of special features and even lack of reunion episode. I think every PR fans would like to know a little bit more of those designers and challenges even what else did judges say. Every DVD has extras. And no reunion!! speechless, I don't know what were they thinking!"
3,Fading Fast,"I really enjoyed the first film, it had some interesting killings, some humor and a generally original premise. The second one was not as much fun following the same idea. The third seemed like a really bad low budget mess. I would normally say to just pick up the first film, but since it seems to go for over 20 dollars by itself, you might as well pick up a 3 pack for a bit more. You may end up enjoying the 2 sequels more than I did."
5,happy i baught it,I'll be the first to abmit i'm a suspens junkie! This product was perfect. the third movie had a little more gore than i care for but it was worth it. The package arrived in a timely manner and played well.
2,These DVDS are just the three Urban Legends - Just Put Together,"It's just three Urban Legend Movies put together, so it's typicaly the same thing, and the same bonus features.URBAN LEGEND is a movie about those terrifying tales turning true as a college has a serial killer with those motives. 2/5URBAN LEGENDS: FINAL CUT is the movie that is the worst -- and I mean it, it really does suck. At a film school, a movie called Urban Legends is being made, and another serial killer comes slicing the crew members. 1/5URBAN LEGENDS: BLOODY MARY is different from the first two. It is a slasher flick, but with a ghost killing teenagers. 2/5So it's the same old thing. Three DVDS just put together. And I suggest you buy Urban Legends 1 and Urban Legends 3."
1,Not as good as other San Sucre products,"I was disappointed in this product having tried and loved the chocolate mousse. I even tried to ""dress"" up the mousse by hiding the flavor with strawberries and various other fruit, but it still didn't taste well."
2,weird taste...like lemony artificial sweetener,"The texture of this is beautiful...the taste is, frankly, yucky. At first I thought it tasted a little like artificial lemon flavoring rather than ""cheesecake"" but then the aftertaste is really unpleasant very artificial. Bummer."
2,Uninspired live show,"This is one of those live albums that sounds like it caught the band on a bad night. The performances are technically flawless, but there's no fire. The band sounds lethargic and the tunes are played slowly and tentatively. It is, however, a crystal-clear recording and a good setlist, featuring the same lineup as the ""MSG"" album, so it wouldn't actually be a bad thing to own. Interested parties are advised to check out the ""Rock Will Never Die"" set (preferably, the Japanese version with the bonus tracks), which kicks much higher levels of[...]."
1,sucked,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen...do not waste your time or money on it. Acting was horrific, plot was terrible, it just was awful. I'm only giving it a star b/c this site makes me select at least one. It doesn't even deserve a half.."
5,Fantastic noise cancellation,"This headset does a terrific job of cancelling background noise. I use it in my car, and it eliminates the noise from the car, so well that I can play the radio or even drive with the windows open, and the person on the other end can hear me perfectly. They can't hear the radio or the wind noise at all.I do find it a little challenging to get it to sit securely and firmly in my ear, the boom portion is rather heavy so it tends to rotate downward.I love this product and really look forward to a lighter version that will stay in place a bit more easily.Overall, though, a fantastic product that does exactly what it claims to do."
1,Bad customer Support and defective product,I call tech support at least 30 times and nobody answer the phone. Left a message and they called me 2 weeks later. I returnedthe Boom
5,Basic to Advanced,This book is very well thought out and takes it step by step from basic to advanced.The really good thing about it is that it shows you how it looks in Excel which means it helps with how it would be entered into a computer.
4,Shelf worthy but not authoritative,"This book provides the novice a moderate reference to world of investment performance reporting, ala performance reporting 101.As an IT management consult I can comfortably say there is no one authoritative reference on anything. That said, this text while historically and technically accurate does not represent nor provide meaningful examples of contemporary best practices.Also, absent from the text are key discussions I would have benefited: the opportunities availed to a modern organization for large-scale automated computations - rather than all manual processes; linkages to the consumers of the performance information in various communities from client wealth tiers, brokerage operations, and financial advisers, analysts and money managers; and best practices for some of the new product and security types more prevalent in the 2006 era."
5,Great Knives,"I've never had really good knives before purchasing this 3-piece set so I really don't have much to compare it to except the cheaper knives I am used to using. These Global knives are nice: sharp, excellent quality, well balanced. They are obviously of high quality and I have no regrets about this purchase."
3,Costs too much,"For about $25 I bought enough aluminum to make four or five mounting plates. So far I've made two mounting plates with my $25 worth of aluminum. If you have a mill machine or access to one it's quick and easy, and far less expensive than one of these plates. I still have the plate that came with my 102mm Vixen achromat that I bought back in the 1990s and have no complaints about it, but I'm not going to pay this outrageous price for something I can make for far less."
5,Easy way to boost performance,"I've used K&N Air Filters in the past and this recent purchase lives up to my expectations. It does provide my little 4 cylinder with a little extra pick-up at higher RPMs. Mileage is still the same, however. Overall a great product that will pay for itself by not having to be replaced as often."
5,Didn't expect this,"Well, thats a good thing. I love all their albums except for the last two and this first album didn't change that. I am not sure, since this album was in 1984, but i think it is the first punk album. It really is punk, all 14 songs are. I expected Rock and roll like their other 80's albums, but this is pure Punk. FAst guitars, fast lyrics, fast drums= PUNK. Luckily, I have always loved punk, so this might be a biased opinion. If you Like Soul Asylum get this, you might like it. If you were in love with the last three pop rock albums, look for something else."
4,Reflect on the unthinkable,"I've read it casually on the beach, but the words dig in at the deepest levels. Several nights I've awakened with pieces of my life rearranged according to the stories in this book. It has been food for thought and much more than a beach book."
5,"A fascinating examination of aging, romance and love.","Men and women reveal thoughts about love and sex after 60 in this examination of aging and how it affects romance and love. From economic and social barriers to happiness to stereotypes about aging, Seasons of the Heart gathers the stories of average men and women who are elders."
5,Remember the best live band on the planet?,"You wouldn't know it from their later work, but in the mid 1980's, nobody could touch these guys for flat out, big fun, ear bleeding straight ahead rock and roll, (with a little punk rock mixed in, not to mention an occasional Bad Company cover). You can still relive the glory days with ""While you Were Out"" and the companion ""Made to Be Broken"". From the fade in of 'Freaks', the eleven tracks come awfully close to replicating the intensity of their live show. If you were lucky enough to see them in the day, close your eyes and drift back to when 'alternative' rock was for college radio only, no one even knew where Seattle was, and half your records were from Twin Tone. Then again, I only bought the CD because my cassette bootleg finally gave it up after fifteen years."
4,Interesting,"Got this fun piece of work and found it to be quite interesting. I discovered that I understood much of the info included, already. But it was enlightening to delve deeper into this part of understanding how the horse actually works and how this is essential for training at any level."
4,Not for beginners - Good information for Advance users,"I purchased this book for one reason, to learn how to use Visual Studio in a fasion to reduce my development time. This book is packed with good information, but I fear a novice would lose himself. The books author covers large amounts of material very quickly and the layout could be better. At particular pionts in the book where I was following the examples, I became confused on what the author wanted me to do. Inspite of the errors in the way the examples flow and explain themselves. I found the book to be full of information that I had never been explained in other books. I would recommend this book too moderate/Advanced users looking to speed up there development time with Visual Studio."
5,Enlighten yourself,"What an amazing book! Discusses a wide range of issues related to the negative impact of socially-irresponsible corporations. One of the best books on the topic. You will feel very educated on this issue after reading the book.I also like how the authors offer a very balanced perspective about corporations. For example, the recognize that many people who work at these multinational corporations might be good, caring citizens, but in their position, as say CEO, they recognize that their responsibility is to make as much money as possible for their shareholders.The examples in this book are chilling and memorable. Share this book with a friend!"
2,Alright,It was alright...kind of a boring read...tries to Demonize corporations as the root of the problems in society when that is completely not true...but of course that is my opinion. You might like the book though...if youre a liberal that is
4,Bakan ignored something important,"I really enjoyed this book. It's such a powerful lense use for looking at capitalism. But I think he over-simplifies with his argument that corporations have been legally mandated to single-mindedly pursue profits. Sure, most CEOs probably believe that this is their sole legal responsibility, but a number of legal scholars would disagree. Numerous people have pointed this out. Here's one example you can search.Harvard Business Review: The Myth of Shareholder CapitalismI think Bakan should have mentioned that this is actually an ongoing debate that was not at all settled with Dodge vs. Ford. If we want corporate executives to change behavior wouldn't it be a good idea to communicate the fact that they're are NOT obligated to only think of profits?Comments on this are very welcome"
1,The Socialists are crazy,"There is nothing new in this book that hasn't been pounded into the ground by Socialists every where. More government control, check; restrictions on free speech, check; higher taxes and fees, check; a sop to the environmentalists, check. He's writing about turning us into a socialist state, period. We already have a byzantine regulatory structure and it's just getting worse. There is a difference between effective regulation and a plethora of regulations. He's no different than Karl Marx and just as wrong."
5,"A very thought-provoking book, worth reading!","I very much enjoyed Dr. Bakan's book. It was truly thought-provoking, and jelled a number of thoughts and ideas I had had in the past about the how and why of corporations. I have started up a company of my own in the past, and plan to do so again in the future. After having read Dr. Bakan's book as well as ""Big Vision, Small Business"" by Jaimie Walters, I have definitely changed my mind about HOW to set it up and run it!. I think this should be read by anybody and everybody in corporate and government roles today...As Dr. Bakan says, it isn't the cure-all, but it may nudge a few people to work towards the appropriate solution!"
5,Highly recomended,"I highly recomend this book for anyone that is even remotely interested in globilization and the corporate world. It shows just how much of our daily lives are influenced and even controlled by corporations. It makes you realize that no matter what they say, a corporation really does only look out for itself, and any advertisements that claim that corporations help communities and people and save the environment out of their own good will have absolutely no truth to them. It also makes you realize how far a corporation will go to save a few dollars, knowingly putting lives at risk in the process.The book is also very well written, with plenty of explinations, so you don't need a background in economics to understand it.In short, I totally recomend this book to anyone that wants to know the truth about the corporation. It will make you sick to realize what lengths they will go to in order to exploit everyone and everything."
3,Difference of Opinion,"This is a great mellow mix. It's nothing mindblowing, but definately some good listening even though I have most of the originals. Don't be fooled by DJ Dissapointed, this isn't a dissapointment. And for the record, Karmacoma appeared on Protection, not Mezzanine, as stated in his review."
4,raw and unnerving,"This is the Babes' debut album,and the name right away gets you interested.""Spanking Machine"" has some great songs on there,such as ""Swamp Pussy"",""You're Right"",""Dust Cake Boy"",and my absolute favorite,""Lashes"". the lyrics (when you can understand them,or,like I do,look them up online),are so deep and poetic and personal.Kat's angry,hurt yowl and soft,babydoll whisper are a fantastic mixture of what makes Kat Kat.This CD is hard to listen to at first,since I was used to the more melodic ""Fontanelle,"" but it has grown on me. it is so complex yet primitive,groundbreaking yet stereotypically punk.I also recommend ""Fair is Foul and Foul is Fair,"" the latest compilation of Babes material.It has several demos of many songs on ""Spanking Machine"". I highly recommend this album!!""I see you grew into that stiff grey suit they've sewn for you/scrubbed you clean now you forgot what you mean""-Kat Bjelland on ""Lashes"""
5,scary,"i really didn't like this album at first. i thought it was too noisy and atonal. but then a friend introduced me to sonic youth, and i instantly became a fan. inside one of the sonic youth cd's( goo, to be exact), thurston moore is wearing a babes in toyland t-shirt. i gave this cd another try, and i realized the true artistry of these women. the anger and raw emotion that go into these songs is astounding, and i instantly started loving them. i very good purchace."
2,A Misnomer,"This is not a book on Multicultural Psychology but a book about prejudice and discrimination. The title is a misnomer in that interpersonal relations among different ethnic groups are not addressed. What is addressed is prejudice in a far ranging scope that leaves little to the imagination as to its source. It neglects important topics, such as, how do relations among the ethnic diversities in America affect acculturation processes and strategies or even prejudice. The book presents prejudice as a one way street and makes several general statements, which appear to be the author's opinion, with no empirical support. The author indicates that the world judges people based on European American values as if ethnocentricism wasn't part of every culture. If you want some resources on prejudice and discrimination, you will find many in this book. However, it will require a careful critical reading to determine which of the author's interpretations are consistent with the data."
2,I bought it for class,"I don't really like this textbook, the first chapter is all opinion and has a bias that I find offensive that feels closed minded."
2,A lot of common sense,"This book is ok, but a lot of the points made are obvious to anyone who has given serious thought to moving, working, and living overseas in today's world. The more critical issues that one faces are given only superficial attention, and a constant pitch for the ""companion book"" (not included) for elaboration. Why not include it all in one book?On the plus side, chapter 7 gives some decent detail into the mechanisms behind culture shock that may keep you sane if you are having a tough time overseas. But 30 good pages out of 200 probably make this book one to pass on."
4,So you're going oversees,"Clear, simple and full of insights and examples that perhaps one didn't think of, unless you know many that have been through it. Easy informative reading. Lists and chapters are well organized."
5,Get Real - This Was Soul Asylum at Their Best!,"The disconnect between Soul Asylum's early fans and the later MTV-oriented fans is clear. MTBB captures the essence of Soul Asylum when they were a rowdy, sloppy, and hugely inspired band from the incredible Minneapolis scene of the mid-80's. This was well before they played at the Clinton inaguration and Pirner started showing up in People next to Winona Ryder.Every song on this album is a gem, especially the title track and Never Really Been. MTBB ranks up there with anything from Husker Du, the Meat Puppets, or the Minutemen when one tries to list the most important albums of the period.Unfortunately for early fans, SA after Hang Time are like the Rolling Stones after Some Girls: increasing popularity and decreasing inspiration. Even though I no longer pay attention to SA, I'll still always appreciate what they accomplished on MTBB."
5,That stuff is hard,"I just remember an article in Spin where they talked about a show during the Grave Dancers union tour when a fan made a screaming request for ""tied to the tracks."" All Dan said (as they instead began another of the weak poppy songs of their later period) was ""that stuff is hard.""I was in a band in the mid to late 80's and I could barely focus on playing anything other than songs from MTBB and Hang time. These were unique albums in a way that the derivative post grave dancers' stuff cold never be.And live they were even better!R Williams from SF, CA has got it perfect...the decline of SA wasn't overnight and there were moments in each of the later albums (I tried for a long time to let them grow on me but couldn't get past the sugary sweet bit).This one is from a time when they mattered!"
2,Dumb,"I love Soul Asylem, but comparing this one to Let Your Dim Light Shine, And the Horse They Rode in On, and especially Grave Dancer's Union, Made to be Broken falls way short. The first three songs are the only ones worth listening to."
3,Not bad for the price!,"I recently purchased this knife and was happy with the quality for what I paid. The knife came sharp, but I'm not sure if it's what I would call a good sharp. It will definitely cut you, but it seems to have a rough edge on it, not a fine polished edge. I have read that these knives usually have to be reprofiled (Don't recall the angle though?) in order to keep a good edge, so plan on having to do this.The biggest drawback of the knife is the sheath, it does not look as if it would hold up for more than a field trip or two? Other than that, I feel that it was a good purchase for the price. Keep in mind though that for about $15.00 to $25.00 more that you can get the authentic Ontario version of this knife."
2,"not bad for a boyscout knife,not a heavy use knife","I believe in keeping this review simple.Not a survival knifeOk for boyscout type use, or simple camping, mild and light use.Edges will take work."
3,in real looks and feels cheap,this knife worth the money it's sold for - in real it looks and feels quite cheap. it's hard to tell how strong the blade is.
3,hat,needed one for my kid's halloween costum - this was a hat and worked just fine - these postings are dumb
5,Thumbs up,"Excellent. All the topics are covered very well. Both the nut shell chapters and reference chapters are well done. I highly recommend this book. Instead of pouring through the vast information on XML and realted techlogies and confusing myself, I thought I will bet my 30 bucks on O'reilly. Well , I am glad I did that. As a java programmer I am greatful to the authors insight to add references for SAX and DOM. I liked the chapters on namespaces,XPath, XPointers and XSL-FO. They gave a good introduction and insight into these technologies."
4,"Very good, compact book","My compliment for the excellent XIAN 2nd edition. I really like the short format of this book. A lot of information and clearexamples without much clutter in a few pages. Well done!Personally, I wouldn't mind if the reference section (part IV) would be taken out. These are easilly available from the WEB, and I prefer references in electronic format anyway, because I will always have them at hand (everything that I need is on my laptop), and they can easilly be searched. It would make the book a somewhat lighter in appearance."
4,Good but many Mistakes,Good explanations and examples but download all of the verified and unverified errata off of [the web] to save yourself some pain. Don't count on the example files to be any more bug-free than the book.
1,XML in a nutshell,"This is the most confusing technical book I have read in years. Examples are poor and while it brushes on most aspects of XSLT, it fails to explain concepts in a clear concise manner that you would expect of a 'in a nutshell' style book.Please don't waste your money - you would be MUCH better off not purchasing anything at all and studying one of many free online XML tutorials."
2,bad organization with some typo erros.,"I have read part of the book and tried to use it as a reference, but always confused with the bad organization, not to mention some typo errors.personally, I don't recommend it."
4,Beautiful reference,"The Nutshell series of books from O'Reilly have a special section of my desk established for them; no other set of books condenses so much information for reference. This book is no exception to this fact.Before I continue, please avoid buying an O'Reilly Nutshell book expecting it to teach you about the topic it is intended for. As far as I've worked with them, these books are not intended as a do-all be-all that other references want to be. The information introducing you to XML is sparse, so if you don't know anything about XML, get another book. I recommend XML: A Primer by Simon St. Laurent; it is an excellent learning tool, and though it doesn't go into all the detail the XML standard can go into (no book I've found can do such), it provides the user with understanding of XML.XML in a Nutshell is what I use when I've forgotten how to use a certain aspect of XML detail. As a reference and a second book on XML, nothing comes close."
3,Specialized reference book for XML with JAVA,"This books starts out with a quick explanation and walkthrough or XML 1.0 specification that is pretty good. It is lacking a XML Schema (XSD) section as well covers very briefly the XSLT (XML Stylesheets) anyone wishing to anything with sytlesheets after reading this book will be disappointed. XPath coverage is pretty good as well as SAX, & DTD. XLink, XPointer, are talking about but nothing in depth. All example code is in JAVA. Anyone wanting specialized knowledge of ASP.NET / .NET / MS SQL usage of XML should look elsewhere (this is somewhat understandable due to the publish date.)"
3,Good Reference,"This is a good reference. Covers XML fundamentals well. Though it has some glaring mistakes like the meaning of ?,*,+ in a DTD, it does well on most of the other fronts.Note that XML Schemas are not covered in this book, so you should be aware of that before buying this book. Most probably it should be there in the next version though."
1,Not so great,With this CD Con recorded the music but someone else mixed it and it shows. Very different from his other releases and not nearly as rewarding as his own mixed material.
5,i love it,"exactly what i expected the perfume was great with long lasting smell, i'll go for it again"
4,Naomi Campbell Perfume,The product is exactly what was advertised. I am very pleased with the product. It took a little while extra to get to canada but that is to be expected.
3,"nice watch, dead battery","nice watch,,, however in the product description it said that the band material was made of plastic and its actually made out of a cloth type material. the watch itself looked as if it was a couple of years old lying with the seller. the battery worked for a couple of hours and stopped the day i got it. disappointed that i have to change the battery now...."
4,Almost Great,"The problem with this CD is that it contains only a fraction of the music in the show itself. Admittedly, it contains the major numbers, but a lot of good stuff from the original show is missing. Since it is the only CD available, I recommend it, but if and when this show gets to the London or New York stage, a CD containing more of the entire work will doubtless become available. The liner notes are sparse. The listener who has not seen the show will not have a clue as to what is going on with the story line. This is a real shame, because understanding the story line brings a special poignancy to many of the songs. If you can wait a year or two for another edition to appear, do so. Otherwise buy it now. If it were complete and had better liner notes, I'd give this one five stars plus. The fellow playing Peter Allen and the gal playing Lisa Minelli are dynamite talents."
3,Good - but not great. 7/10,"I'd place this game on a par with Ridge Racer. The graphics are appealing, but frankly the PSP can do better - and has on games such as Burnout or Wipeout. The music is a mixed bag. A few of the driving tunes are rocking, but some are downright annoying. The steering controls are a bit sloppy, but you can make do.Overall Outrun is good, but not great. If you just want some simple minded arcade style racing, Outrun will do the trick."
4,"Exciting, but a few flaws","Great game to have in your PSP collection. Fun game to pick up and play. It even includes the gameplays from the arcade versions of Outrun. Alot of unlockables forces you to keep going further into the game. Although this game does tend to get repetitive when trying to unlock cars.great fun, but lacks somewhat creativity. don't expect too much more than the arcade versions, but still should keep you hooked for a while."
3,"3 1/2 stars, very mucgh better than average but not really outstanding",A group of humanoid aliens is running a pony girl operation for the rich on a remote island in the Shetlands. The cops have gotten involved and are trying to figure out what is going on. The aliens can transfer minds into cloned bodies. The plot is really pretty good very much better then the usual. Character development is nicely done. No real humor but some. Several good brief erotic scenes but for real erotica you need Angelika Knight et al. Lots of mparallel threads at the same time which means that some scenes are only one paragraph which does get annoying.
3,Buyer Beware,"This album deserves five stars for the music and one star for the re-issue job. While it's nice to have the sound upgraded, I expected better packaging than this slap-dash affair, especially at full retail price-point. The original art is poorly reproduced and there are no additional photos or bits of information. It will be the perfect dust-gathering companion to the lousy-sounding TwinTone CD I bought years ago. Now, where did I put that original vinyl..."
4,"Good, but not Great","Though I love the Replacements, I didn't think this was as good an album as either ""Tim"" or ""Pleased to Meet Me,"" though it certainly could be more pivotal. The boys finally mature on this one, with playing and songwriting coming together to form a cohesive body of work. Check out the desperation in Paul's voice on the closing cut, ""Answering Machine."""
5,The sound of a band hitting its stride,"With all due respect to Hootennany, the Mats last album on TwinTone is far and away their best. And when you consider the album in context - this is 1984 we're talking about - it's easy to understand why Let It Be was so underappereciated. Here, the Mats are at the beginning of their apex (made up of this album, Tim and Pleased To Meet Me) and far ahead of their time that it would take 8 years for anything comprable to find its way onto daytime radio.Let It Be pretty well bridges between the drunken goofiness of Hootennany and the drunken greatness of Tim and PTMM. Unsatisfied and Answering Machine are my two favorite songs on the album, both precursors to Skyway (possibly the Mats' best song). The rest of the album either rocks (Black Diamond), smirks (Anadrogynous) or both (Gary's Got a Boner, Seen Your Video). It might be a little edgy for anyone just getting into the Replacements, but for the brave and the initiated, it's a thing of beauty."
1,Agree with Jeff - another Rhino/Warner gouge,"Sorry, but I have to agree with Jeff - this is yet another example of why so many people won't buy music these days. Let's see, the album is how many years old, has been remastered once before, and now they are charging full list price and want folks to buy it AGAIN! Maybe one or two bonus tracks is good on each of these reissues, but it's largely marginal to bad demos and outtakes. And the ~15 minute ""Stink"" should have been added to the ~36 minute ""Sorry Ma..."" If Rhino wants my money, they should look at what Virgin has been doing with remasters like the early OMD albums. All great quality, some excellent extra tracks, and several bucks cheaper."
1,Greatest album ever but don't spend your money if you already own it,"Let It Be is the greatest album ever recorded. Period. It was great when I bought it on vinyl, great when I bought it on CD and great again when I bought it again today on this expanded version.However, the running time - for a medium that can hold 80 minutes - is a mere 54 minutes! I shelled out money for an extra 21 minutes! That's actually only 17 if you take out the one extra cut I already had.I am sure all music fans feel sorry to some degree for everyone in the music industry that is facing tough times. Yet, the fact that even in their darkest hour they keep (trying to) ripping us off means that we need not feel sorry anymore.All at Warner, I won't be buying the other reissues. Pity, I thought you might have been on the rise!"
5,wanna hear a little bit of gossip?,"okay, okay, okay: everyone knows this is a classic garage/punk/whatever album. of course it is. buy it! but i've heard some information about the band itself that you may find interesting: it seems that back in the day, when they made this album, they consumed alcoholic beverages to a degree that was not entirely healthy for young men. somehow, despite this behavior, they still made great rock 'n' roll records. go figure!"
5,One of the Great albums of the past two decades,"Rarely has something been so great without taking on risks. But somehow 'Let it Be' is stripped of any self importance or pre tenses that seem to go hand in hand with brilliant music. Now usually when this happens you get rather straight forward and ultimately monotonous music,but on 'Let it Be' you enter a piece of work that submerges itself in a young westerberg's musical schizophrenia. how can a song like ""androgynous"" coexsist on an album with a song like ""tommy gets his tonsils out"",the latter preceding the former mind you, and still work, I don't know but it just does.if your hip to to it you'll never stop listening to it,it was also bob stinson's finest moment. Particularly on the""sixteen blue"" track,if that final solo doesn't rip you to shreds then you probally won't like this album,or for that matter anything else in this world thats worth liking."
5,still my favorite mats album,"Living in a small town in Florida I did not get much of a chance to hear much alternative music. I had got to love the Ramones, Clash, U2 and other better known bands and was looking to hear something new. While visiting relatives in Philedelphia I bought this cd on the reccomendation of the clerk in the summer of 89. I fell in love with first listen. Over the years I have bought all of the Mats albumns but I still consider this my favorite. This is the perfect cd for someone not that familar with the replacements to get. It is the middle ground for them as artist. Not as raw as their earlier recordings and not as produced as the later stuff."
3,Hindsight is always 20/20...,"When Let It Be came out it was hailed by critics across the nation as one of the greatest rock albums ever. After sixteen years it's easy to see that time has not been kind to the Replacements. That's not to say that there aren't great songs here, as I Will Dare, Sixteen Blue, Androgynous, and Answering Machine show. But the rest of the album is sloppy rock that any barely competent bar band could have easily wrote. If you want a better (but definitely not a masterpiece) Replacements album, check out Pleased To Meet Me. Otherwise, give me Husker Du or the Meat Puppets over The Replacements anyday."
1,An awesome disc with a fatal flaw...,"Other reviewers have mentioned this too: the fade out on Easy Money. I find this less forgiveable than others. Why? Because this is the ""30th Anniversery Limited Edition"" version, that's why. Shameless. No excuse for not doing this right. Back to my own compilation of Live 1973-1974 Crimson drawn from The Great Deceiver... Don't waste your money. There are better versions of Fracture and Starless on TGD anyway."
5,Best Wetton-era Live Album,"As soon as I heard that this was released I rushed out to the record store to buy it. I had looked for this album before and was frustrated with the lack of availability of it. Let me tell you that I was not disappointed in my purchase.Wetton's bass and vocals have never sounded better than on this live release. In fact, the entire band was in fine form; very tight and loud. The last track, ""Starless"" is the most compelling track in this set - a treat, since most songs from the Red album aren't available on the various Crimson live recordings.The packaging was great (cardboard sleeve with a more than ample amount of liner notes and pictures from the period) and the audio was mixed very well. The only down side was the fade out of Easy Money - I don't quite know why that was done, but the inclusion of Starless makes up for it, in my opinion.If you like John Wetton era King Crimson, your collection cannot lack this essential component."
3,"And once again, no subtitles !!!!","Please studios, put subtitles on your movies. What is the meaning of releasing movies on DVD which allow multiple audio or subtitles streams and providing none?Are you aware not everybody is fluent in english?Are you aware many people are deaf or hearing impaired?This movie is great, I have it on VHS with french subs, but I will not buy it, not enough fluent in english to enjoy it 100%.At least provide english subtitles, I buy every month DVD with only english subtitles and it is great. I understand when you have to create subtitles in a foreign language, you have to hire people, it costs money but to create subtitles in your own language, anyone can do it, you listen, you write. Criterion is not a small studio. Should be mandatory to include at least subtitles in the language of the movie or from the country in which it is released."
3,"Not a ""Lady Vanishes"" Movie","A collectors gem due to the famous Actors. The plot does not comparewith those who like Train Mysteries. ""The Lady Vanishes"" for example, a Hitchcock mystery out does Night Train to Munich. In any event the Gondola scene at the end reminds one of a much more exciting scenes of ""Where Eagles Dare"" with Clint Eastwood and Richard Burton."
1,Misses the criterion,A good copy of an interesting British WWII film from 1940. But without any of the expected Criterion treatment. There was so much I wanted to learn an so little commentary. The VHS version is much cheaper and ends the same. Very disappointing.
2,Yet another window-boxed release...,"Isn't it about time Criterion ceased window-boxing their release of classic cinema titles?Sorry guys, but you lost a sale here, and that will continue, as long as you persist in window-boxing the picture.Great film, but a dubious visual presentation..."
4,Discover a gem,"Of course with Carol Reed as director I was hoping for a first rate film and I was not disappointed. Suspenseful, humorous, with a nice set of twists, this film left me feeling I had made a small find. Definitely recommended!"
3,"Overall pretty good and satisfied, BUT....","Mace Windu is supposed to have a PURPLE light saber! This one came with a blue light saber. My son was disappointed, but it's ok now. Mace just hangs out in the bottom of the toy box (along with poor Woody)."
1,One Of The Most Annoying Songs Of The Summer.,"The summer was filled with alot of horrible hits,and Vanessa Carlton's hit A Thousand Miles is no exception.I have always hated this song,but it just became much more aggravating when it went popular.Summer songs are supposed to usually be catchy,not stupid like this one."
5,Sexy,Don't wear this out unless you want to get the attention of every man and the ire of any woman in the area. It's supportive and sexy...my man loves it...and the attention it brings.
4,very nice,"We've tried several of this type of bra and this one is the best of the bunch. Provides at least some support and seems to be of decent quality. My wife liked it enough that I bought a backup in a different color. Be warned though, that a full B cup is about the limit unless you are very firm (read implants), otherwise you may fall out the front."
1,Waste of Money,Don't waste your time or money with this product if you have bigger breasts or breasts at all for that matter. It's made for flat chested women who have a cups. If you have any boobs at all they'll just fall out of the bra. The underwire does nothing at all. What a waste!
2,"Works as advertised, but priced a bit high since the quality is ?","We bought a black and a white version of this bra. It is something for fun, but I think it is overpriced, and for that I don't like it. It really should be priced under $15, and not over for the quality and what you are getting - less material, no support. I give it 2 stars for not being valued well in my opinion. I have bought sexier XOXO bras at ROSS for a fraction of the price. Live 'n Learn.I think a better item to purchase for a much better value isRene Rofe EL-RR2008, Rene rofe lace peek-a-boo bra & crotchless panty set.Have a look!"
2,rocket boobs,"This bra could be sexy if the opening was bigger. I ordered a 36D and the whole fit was nowhere close to a D cup, when I tried to arrange things all I got was Very Pointed Rocket Boobs. The opening needs to be bigger if the cup size is larger. Returned item"
5,WOW!,"My wife is already HOT,but when she put this on WOW!Very fast customer service very much a plus when purchasing item."
1,Misleading / False Advertising!,"I bought this DVD because it was advertised on Amazon as ""JumpStart Video Training Guide on DVD for the CANON 30D Digital Camera"".This DVD is NOT Canon 30D training! Very angry about this. This is simply a DVD on how to use a VIDEO CAMERA.#1. The canon 30d is NOT a video camera!Why is this product on Amazon???I am so upset! It's so basic, it has the nerve to have a 5 minute segment on how to setup your video camera.there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING on this dvd about a DSLR Camera!The actual title of this video (which is too small to see online) is ""SHOOTING AND PRODUCING GREAT VIDEOS"""
4,Very good job at continuing the series.,I thought that this book was a very good continuation of the series. I dont want to give any of the book away but I cant wait to read the next book. I dont know about you but I love Christy Miller and I cant wait to see if Todd and Christy get married or not. oh just read it.
5,WoW ! What an Awsome book! Great job Robin!,"I would have to say this is the BEST book I've ever have read. I couldn't put it down!Great job robin! keep it up .It's sad that after ""I promise"" the seies will be ending.!I encourage you to write a series for the ""early married years!And I hope there will be a ""sierra jenson college years""too! For those who haven't read the ""Sierra jeson or the Christy miller series"",Iencourage you to you'll learn alot about God,love,freindship and comitment.Keep writing all these great books Mrs.gunn!"
5,As you wish,As you wish was a wonderful book. It was full of suprises in every chapter. During the book I was mad at some of the people(even though there imaginary). I cried when something very sad happened to Todd. And was laughing and was very happy when something so wonderful happened to David. I would totally recommened this book to young people as myself. You will love this book. It helps you over come real life situation. I love these books and I'm sure you will too.
3,"Ok, but immature","I used to love Robin's books when I was 13, but now, three years later, they just seem immature. All of them are so similar. Christy's personality so indecisive and emotional and easily-stressed-out sometimes-- I'd rather read about a strong, independent, interesting young women with big dream, ambitious goals, and a relaxed, fun-loving attitude."
4,Good book,My 13 year old daughter read this book and through the whole series and really loved it. I would recommend it for teenage girls.
1,No Content,The book contained no information that common sense wouldn't already tell you. It was pricey for a few short pages. Extremely fast read with nothing of interest.
2,"Looks pretty, but is empty of content","I bought all 3 books in the Pink Books series and I am disappointed with each and every one of them, they're each small, cute and portable (think about keeping it in your mini purse to read while waiting in line), but the content is more than just lacking, it's like reading the headlines of the news without actually reading the story. Wouldn't buy again. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the design and portable size."
1,Doesn't last long,I'm not usually a big sweater in general and when I used this deodorant I think it made me sweat! I found I had to keep applying every 2 hours or else I would start to have body odor. I wouldn't recommend this product unless nothing else works for you. The smell is nice!
5,AWESOME products!,"This review is not specifically for this particular deodorant but for the Desert Essence Natural Roll-On Deodorant with organic tea tree oil, lavender, and aloe. This stuff really works and works well at controlling underarm odor. Two other ""natural"" deodorants I tried only lasted 8 hours if that and when the 8 hours were over, my underarms would reek! Thank God I picked up a bottle of Dessert Essence. I didn't think anything could work so well and last so well; especially during the summer months and after a good workout at the gym. I am also a fan of their coconut shampoo, conditioner, and body wash."
1,WARNING! They have CHANGED the formula of this product!,"They have CHANGED the formula of this product. It no longer contains propylene glycol, which may please some people, but it absolutely stopped working for me. The old product worked great for years and then suddenly stopped working. I thought that I had bought the wrong deodorant, but when I checked I saw the completely new ingredients. Sadly, they didn't even change the item number or UPC code of this totally different product, so you don't even know what you're buying when you order it online. The one pictured here is no longer available. You may get someone who has old stock, but they have stopped manufacturing it. I won't be buying it anymore. Propylene Glycol is perfectly safe unless you have a sensitivity to it, so I will be seeking out another aluminum-free product. Sigh. . ."
3,It's Okay; It's Nice; It's Not FANTASTIC,"This deodorant rolls on really easily. It doesn't pass the Indian Summer sweltering heat test. It doesn't last. it works perfectly fine for everyday use where you won't sweat through heavy exertion or exercise, but if you exercise or get caught in a very hot day, it needs to be reapplied. That's why, for my needs, it's average or just okay. I've found better: Tom of Maine's Natural Deodorant Stick Calendua. I wish it came in roll-on, but it really lasts -- even under exercise sweat and 90-degree heat."
2,"Good Book, Bad Edition.","I read this for my Political Parties Class. I found the book very interesting, however there were more typos in this book, than in any book I have ever read. I would buy a different edition of this book. This is a reprint from a company that only does reprints of rare books. Find another one to go with, you have to decipher this one. For example, some ""I"" are replaced with ""!"", and so on. Very annoying."
5,He gives all the secrets,"I originally read this book in undergraduate school as Political Science major, and had to go back and find a copy because of the profound affect it had on my psyche. George Washington Plunkitt was a ""stereotypical"" politician. You know, the one who says what he needs to say to get elected; but once there does what's necessary for his party.Comparing his comments to the actions of present day politicians, I don't think there are many differences. Everyone does a little grafting and civil servants are still ""civil servants."" Understood?As with any politician, Plunkitt ""seen (his) opportunities and (he) took 'em."" This is a must for anyone interested in any realm of politics."
1,Avoid CreateSpace Edition,"Plunkitt of Tammany Hall is a humorous and insightful classic. Unfortunately, the CreateSpace edition contains numerous typesetting errors, including random, unexplained periods and ""1""s where ""I""s should be. It's poor treatment for a classic text and CreateSpace comes across looking unprofessional."
5,"great, quick delivery",delivery was fast and very efficient. i would buy from this seller again. thanks!!
4,Excellent solo recording from ex-Tangerine Dream member,"Wuivend Riet marks Johannes Schmoelling's first solo recording since his departure from Tangerine Dream. Wuivend Riet (""wind-blown reeds"" in Dutch) was first composed by Johannes for the play Opus ESP (by Hans Bosch). The music is nostalgic, moving, and best shows Johannes Schmoelling's talents as a solo artist. A definite must for any Tangerine Dream fan!"
5,A touch of Tangerine Dream,"Any of you who enjoy Tangerine Dream know this former member from the 80's when he joined them. He did a remarkable job, great synth playing with some percussion, very relaxing and worth the money."
1,Missing Track 6!,"This is an excellent recording, which I first discovered in the 80's on cassette and wore out the tape. I am updating my collection and discovered the MP3 download at a great price, so I purchased it. Only when I listened did I learn that track 6 is missing! (Wuivend Riet, pt. II, 12:48). An explanation from Amazon would be in order, even better would be to have the track available for purchase."
3,catatonic planet,"This is definitely worth owning for a few tracks (notably ""Catatonic"", with its skipping drumbeat), but it doesn't compare to ""Fontanelle"" or ""Spanking Machine""."
4,Does the job,"Got this to hang a hand towel in my 5 year olds bathroom where she can reach it easily. It does the job...thin enough that I could slide it in between that top drawere that doesn't open on the vanity and the vanity frame. Just the right height for little ones! Towel stays put on it, much better than the knob we had on the wall for it."
2,"great idea, not the greatest product","purchased this hook to hang kitchen dishtowels from. the hook is fine for hanging, but towels get bunched up and take a while (too long) to dry. hook slides on the top of the cabinet door and falls off occasionally. shipping was more expensive than the hook itself."
3,Enyoyable read but disappointing ending,I found this to be a generally very enjoyable and well-written story with some beautiful descriptive passages about the Maine coastline. A particular highlight was the period of the war which I found gripping and graphically illustrating the effects for families at home. The main characters are quite well developed but some of the more minor ones are rather one-dimensional. Unfortunately the book is let down by the ending which gives the impression of being a bit rushed and in a couple of key places frankly not credible. But I would certainly read another book by this author.
4,A Great Read,"I agree with the earlier reviews. Beautifully written, a very well woven plot line, and the exquisite simplicity of true ""Downeaster"" philosophy and ethics.My only minor complaint is that while his descriptive passages are beautiful, I sometimes got the feeling that he was ""trying too hard"" and heading a little toward ""verbal gymnastics"".As I said, this is only a ""minor"" point.Well worth reading, and a phenomenal first novel by a gifted writer. I will be awaiting his next effort."
3,"Promising, slowing, and then disappointing","Started off beautifully written, but characters a bit too one dimensional--more characters and less boatmaking description would've been better in my opinion. Ends with a cop-out court drama that just became too unbearable to finish. I really wanted to like this book but felt the ending was disappointing. Court cases: ho-hum. I could watch Matlock or read John Grisham if I needed another dose of courtroom climax. But the writing is superb and unique, thus he gets 3 stars...a writer to watch and who I believe will increase in talent and skill."
4,Best Collection At A Bargain Price,"In preparation for seeing Michael Schenker Group in concert, I tracked down this 2 disc anthology of his work with UFO and his early MSG work. It is a great collection! The hits, ""Doctor, Doctor,"" ""Armed And Ready,"" and ""Cry For The Nations"" are there, and at 28 tracks total, this collection includes some deeper cuts as well.There are some other anthologies out there, and of course to have a comprehensive collection of UFO and MSG, you would need to get the original CD's, but for anyone looking for a great set of heavy, guitar driven, rock songs featuring Germany's finest, you can't go wrong with this set!In fact, from the track listings I have seen, I feel this is the best collection of these two bands anywhere."
4,A Good Introduction To Michael Schenker,"Let me start off by saying that I am not a Michael Schenker fan(yet). This is the first album of his(not including ""Lovedrive"" by the Scorpions) that I have bought. I have a two disc version. Disc one is UFO and Disc two is MSG. I'm still getting to know the cd, but I must say that I am quite impressed.Disc one1.Rock Bottom2.Lipstick Traces3.Shoot Shoot4.High Flyer5.Belladonna6.On With The Action7.Natural Thing8.Try Me9.Too Hot To Handle10.Only You Can Rock Me11.Love To Love12.Doctor Doctor(Live)13.Lights Out(Live)14.Looking Out For Number OneDisc Two1.Armed And Ready(Live)2.Into The Arena(Live)3.Cry For The Nations4.Looking Out From Nowhere5.Lost Horizons6.Looking For Love7.On And On8.Assault Attack9.Rock You To The Ground10.Dancer11.Captain Nemo12.Time13.Save Yourself14.DestinyFor a good introduction to the music of Michael Schenker, get this cd set."
3,"A little of this, a little of that","This compilation is a hybrid between a UFO greatest hits and one from MSG (both of which feature the amazing lead playing of one Michael Schenker). The problem is that it leaves off 7 or 8 classic tunes from each band. You would be better of getting the incredible ""Michael Schenker Story Live"" album if you want a complete compilation of all his best loved songs performed by his best lineup (sorry Cozy). Or, if you want the original versions, get the ""Essential UFO"" and ""Essential MSG"" respectively."
5,Easily my Favorite Birding Book,"I have quite a few birding books, and run several webpages on birds, and this one is the one that goes with me everywhere, and sits by my window when I'm home. It's fantastic! The drawings with arrows make it VERY clear exactly which bird you're looking at. The maps in the back help clarify where birds live, if you have a question about a bird that looks similar but is defined by its range.The calls listed are very helpful - if you only get a glimpse of something, often you can help narrow down your options by listening to it and seeing which birds match the song pattern.Everything about the book is enormously easy to use. I in fact write right in the book when I've seen a given bird and any additional notes about it - the book is that important to me!One book no birder should be without."
3,Organic Gardening,"It was a great book to use for ideas on how to combat problems, I just hoping it was a bit more detailed/"
4,it was what I expected.,"I haven't been able to try anything in here since it's too cold to gardern yet, but the book so far seems spot on."
5,Very Interesting.,It's good to introduce children to the basic knowledge of world in an interesting and funny way. That's the book!
1,Incorrect information inside book,"I have read the book and I noticed that pages about electrical inventions have no data about Nikola Tesla, one of the most important in this area. I will not waste time to elaborate such incomplete text, but if you remove from our lives all inventions that Tesla made, we would live in Stone Age. In this book, many inventions are just linked to wrong persons, so content is rather false.Here you can read correct info [...]"
4,Love is the Law!,"I was only familiar with 2 Suburbs songs; ""Love is the Law"" and ""Music for Boys."" Both were great, catchy tunes that could fit into either alternative or even dance genres. Hey, they did a remix of one song and the beat certainly qualified for the dance floors. But, as this collection reveals, the Suburbs could also blast you with a punk-ish guitar assault, or woe you with something more in a traditional rock (although with a twist) vein. Some cool stuff on here, but honestly, nothing grabbed me as much as the two songs I was already familiar with. Fans of the band ""back in the day"" will surely love this collection, and other fans of 80s American alternative acts might dig most of it too."
4,Works Fine,"One end is for larger buttons (dress pants and casual shirts) and the second is for smaller (dress shirts) buttons. It does not work for jeans buttons and is probably not good for travel. TheGood Grips Button Hookis better quality and more comfortable, but this one seems to handle a larger button size better."
5,Real conversations,A magazine article rated Pimsleur highly and their recommendation was very accurate. Great conversational learning tool. Very helpful on my recent trip! 1/2 hour sessions make it great and you can repeat them easily if you need too.
2,disappointing,"After reading so many good reviews of this product, I was very disappointed. There is no accompanying booklet, so one cannot actually see the words spoken, in case he did not get it right. The disks are repetitive. The first one concentrated on several words and repeated them for the whole twenty five minutes. In each consecutive disk, only few new words are added. After going through the whole set, I may find it useful to listen only to the last disk, since it contains all the words introduced in this course. After listening to 8 disks of 25 min., I have learned very little, and payed very much. I have a Berlitz course of 3 hours which is much more fun to listen to - it deals with daily life - and contains a booklet with explanations, so this course was a big disappointment.If you are an intelligent student, save you money for better products."
2,PIMSLEUR method is overrated,"PIMSLEUR products seem very highly regarded and it's sales pitch is that you will remember everything that you learn. Well... that's not saying much given the amount of material. There are 8 lessons of 30 minutes each, and the first lesson teaches you how to say ""I understand Italian"", ""I understand English"", ""Do you understand English?"", ""Are you American?"". The material you learn in each lesson is nowhere near enough you need to know for even basic ""tourist"" conversation.The method of repetition and building sentences word by word is a good way to learn pronounciation and learn basic phrases. But these tapes are only good for someone with money to burn. You will need other material (Living Language series is excellent) to really learn the language."
2,Very good... until the 7th round,"This game starts out very good, great graphics, good sound FX, (except for the voice of the annoying co-driver, AAAARRRRGGGGHHH). It starts out fairly simple and easy going, you might not place first, but you can advance fairly easily. But watch out after the 7th..... it goes down hill from there. It took me about 8 tries to beat the 7th round, then the 8th! FORGET ABOUT IT! The game suddenly becomes impossible! The last track of the 8th round is absolutely impossible to complete! It gives you like 28 seconds to get to the check point! I have yet to see it, and I've played the 8th round about 100 times! It made me so mad I haven't played it in a month! If you can put up with the crazy difficulty level then pick this up, if not... STAY AWAY!"
2,Somewhat Uneventful Driving Game,"Just got finished playing Sega Rally 2 ... it was a bit of a disappointment. On the positive side there were many cars to choose from, about 4 tracks, and various modes to play in. But the overall driving model was boring. I think developers could produce much better driving games with what the Dreamcast engine has to offer.Those searching for a better driving game might want to try CART Racing or Monaco GP. I played them on the Sega demo CD and they were LOTS of fun."
2,Could have been better,"The game was a disappointment to me and, quite frankly, a waste of my money. If you are considering buying this, I beg of you, rent it first. I sure wish I had. The only reason i give it two stars instead of one is because the graphics are nice. Sega tried to make the replay value high by adding the career mode, but the game is too boring to get too involved with it. Save your money, especially when you have ""Crazy Taxi"" coming out soon."
3,Visually Great,"I bought this game with the hopes that it would be more than eye candy and was a bit dissapointed. If you really like racing I dont think that this game is anything more than a tease for what a fun game it could be. Each race last an average of 1 minute just when your getting into it, its over. I know its a time based race but they could have made the courses much larger and given you a a better feel for racing. In arcade mode the game is over in 4 races basically 4 minutes. I returned my copy unsatisfied, if you really enjoy racing pick a game where you can really rip it up for more than 1 minute at a time."
2,"NOT TOO GOOD, BUT OKAY","The game was okay but it could have been better. I think that the time limit and check points are stupid. It takes for ever to do anything. By the time you get up the tracks, you might get too a hard track and you might not make the time so you fail and have to start over. You get three chances but sometimes it's not enough. The graphics are ok but when you slide on dirt, asphalt or any type of racing surface it looks like you are in water. They should have put damage into the game, that might have helped the game a little. I really hope that DC does better at racing games in the future and if not save up for Playstation 2."
4,Good show...,"This release is a good one and a accurate snapshot of the band at that time. There are some problems however, the fades on a few tracks are in my opinion, poor decisions. Makes one wonder why they were done that way, it breaks the flow of the disc. I enjoyed the tracks up until 'Fracture' and 'Starless'. Both are painful to listen to and drag on way too long. Some of the same tracks found on 'The Nightwatch' are far better than the versions here on 'USA'. Missing is Robert Fripp's witty commentary from the booklet, just some reviews and clippings. Sound quality is good, HDCD as well. Performances are very good but alas I prefer 'The Nightwatch' versions. 9 Tracks/67.20."
2,underperformer,"Having owned many squeegees in my time I can not see what everyone is crowing about with this item.The black rubber strip- which is the key item- is very average and conforms fair to irregular glass. The joint is hard to adjust to use a swivel technique and the entire unit is hard to clean. One off for price, one off for function and one off for design."
1,bad,If you are really curious on torturing yourself you may try to read that 6 font size published book. Line spacing is the narrowest. There are also some hand drawings among sentences like brackets or arrows or underlined sentences which gives you an impression that as if that book was photocopied from a used one in the smallest font. Before ordering that book although I benefited from look inside facility I couldn't recognize how it was published. It is impossible to read it without a magnifier and pain in your eyes.
3,Let the game and players stand on their own merits,"It's great to have another look at this landmark game, and the colorization didn't bother me as much as I thought it might. But the disconnect the other reviewers noted between the generations of players was quite evident; it seems forced or contrived a bit. And Chris Berman had no business being a part of this production. Why was he standing in Monument Park talking about a football game?Less hokum, more solid production. The game, and the players, need no artificial assistance.Don't get me wrong: This DVD is definitely worth having if you are a fan of either team, or of football from that era. But a more-classic NFL Films treatment, instead of ESPN's heavy-handedness, would be a more-fitting tribute to this most-important game."
2,Where is the complete game?,Sports Illustrated named this game the best of all the NFL games played. I wanted a DVD that shows the complete game including the audio without interruption. This version does neither.
5,Colts ---The Greatest Team Ever,"I have and always will insist that the Colts Should always be considered the most important team in the history of not only the NFL,but all of professional sports. In attendance at Yankee Stadium during this historic game was Lamar Hunt.Hunt was so moved by this electrifying game that he founded the AFL.And because this game fed Hunt's brainchild which also created the Super Bowl,I reiterate that the Colts are the most influential team in the history of organized sports."
2,Baltimore Colts are not the Indy Colts,"It's interesting. But I have problems with having players from the Indianapolis team interviewing the greats of this game is if they have ties to the Baltimore team. They have the same nickname. That's it. The Baltimore Colts are gone, replaced by the Ravens. It's amazing to me that ESPN and the NFL try to make Indianapolis carry a legacy they know nothing about? Too bad Baltimore's football history, nickname and legacy didn't stay in town like the NFL did for Cleveland. But it is nice to have the Baltimore Colts remembered like this."
4,Awesome...,"Loved it..my daughter loved it...son loved it..nice to see alternative material for people to read. We don't all want suburban mainstream drivel. The graphics are excellent, the story of course isn't for everybody, the humor is dark. This was our first from Jhonen, we have a couple of Dirge Lenore comics, which are excellent also."
2,Meh,"Well, comic arrived on time and all, but it was not Jhonen's finest work. It was frankly, half assed, and didn't have a solid plot line. I definitely liked johnny and squee better, but maybe I just grew out of these kind of comics. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Some Fun,I found this unit to have a very good picture quality in the VCR mode. In the DVD mode is not was as good as I thought it would be. It may be in the Quality of the DVD movies I tried. I do have it hooked up with the S-vidio cable to the TV. Hope to hear more form others that know more about this high-teck stuff. Thanks John
1,A terrible company,"I would at all costs stay away from any product made by Phillips. I bought a dvd/vcr combo, it broke, I shipped it to them for repair, they charged me shipping and then sent back another broken unit. They then refused to take it back at their expense, even though they had shipped a broken unit (The first time the dvd didn't work, the unit they shipped to me had a defective vcr). Their customer service people have no authority to help you, and neither does their management. Repeated attempts to move up the ladder were ignored (i.e. being constantly told they weren't available, they never returned phone calls even after telling me they would, etc.). Beware of any Phillips product."
2,Confusing Remote Control,"I found the remote control confusing and unreliable. I have read the instruction manual and found little help. The VCR works fine althougth the DVD has been a poor performer. The DVD has low sound volume when channeled through our TV. I have been disappointed with our purchase. However, it was delivered in a timley fashion and in a professional manner."
3,"Good product, but just good","Great for the home theatre lover on a budget, and/or those not wanting to spend money on two separate componets. However, there is no on-screen menu, and it is sometimes difficuly to switch between dvd and vcr mode. It is essentially two different componets with two different sets of controls in one box."
2,Reliability and Service Problems,"The DVD 740VR that I purchased is unreliable. While recording with the VCR, the picture can fade to the point where colors are washed out, and even to the point where a blue screen is the only thing being recorded. My experience with the service providors was unsatisfactory. I experienced waiting times of greater than 15 minutes to speak to someone, the telephone menus were not entirely obvious, and when I finally did get the right person on the phone, the advice was not helpful. I am replacing this VCR with one that is reliable."
2,Confusing Player,"The small print on the remote is very difficult to see, especially the dark blue print (on a black remote). The print on the combo player is even worse. I seldom record anything anymore. By the time I decifer the confusing instructions, locate my magnifying glass, rifle past the directions written in Spanish, French, and Italian, and finally find English, I've forgotten what I wanted to do.To view a DVD you must push several different buttons on the remote, none of which are the ""DVD"" button. If you forget that the remote was previously used to view a VHS, you can push all the buttons you want, but nothing will happen UNTIL you push ""DVD"". None of the button combinations make sense. You'll be lost if you misplace the instructions or have a bad memory.It isn't possible to record a DVD onto a blank VHS either. Whether this is typical of all combos I don't know, but I think it stinks.Picture quality is fine, as is the sound. I've never had a VHS unravel inside the player."
1,Buy this and you will be disappointed,"Never recorded videos. Terrible manual. Terrible piece of kit. So disappointed, I doubt I will ever buy a Phillips again."
1,GRE Study Guide,I do not recommend this book for studying for the GRE if you have not taken a GRE refresher course. Any course materials you will need will be recommended by the University where you take the course. Taking the course with a friend or associate will help you to maintain good study momentum.
2,Not the best,"I did not find this book to be all that helpful. I found several errors in editing, and contradictory information. There were math problems that had explanations that contradicted what was shown in the examples. For someone like me who has been out of school for 15 years, this was rather frustrating. Additionally, I do not remember seeing any of the ""hot"" GRE words that Barron has in their book on the actual GRE test.I found that my best preparation was to use the POWERPREP software that ETS sends upon registration. Use this software first and then analyze where your weaknesses are."
2,Unfulfilling,"The Barron's manual is in an inadequate preperation guide for the GRE general test. If you need to brush up on math, or even if you need a lot of help in it, then the guide is preety good, providing you with a thorough math review and complete answer explanations. For verbal, however, there is no real guidene. The 3,500 word vocabulary list is daunting and the actual GRE has few, if any, of those words on the exam. It provides NO explanations for verbal questions on the CD-ROM or in the practice exercises, which is troubling cause I needed the boost in Verbal (incidently, I got a 500V and 800M after using the book for six months). As for analytical writing, you're better off getting GRE for Dummies, they have a good review of writing tactics. Overall, this is a good buy ONLY if you feel good about your verbal ability and need a boost on quantitative."
2,Warning - WAY SHORT,"Warning! It's a great little book but its super short! A collection of quotes - valuable as they may be - has to make you think - ""is this really a $7 book if I can read it 10 minutes?"""
2,Didn't like it,"I thought this was going to be some well considered essays on life experience with good, relevant ideas for being a better spouse. Instead it is a bunch of fortune-cookie quotes arranged by various topic headings. This did not provide the level of substance that I expected."
3,Book set,The books were given as a gift for a newly wed couple .. so hopefully they read it and it was ok
3,"Caution, whining ahead!!","This is a good book to keep in the bathroom magazine rack. Be careful and just read one or two pages at a sitting.I made the mistake of reading most of the book at one time .... Whaa, whaa, whaa, blah, blah, blah.When I finally threw it down I felt like I had been beaten up. Husbands are insensitive, brutish louts!A lot of the quotes (complaints) are from divorced women, married 2 or 3 times.Don't get me wrong, there's some good advise here, just ration it out slowly otherwise you might feel like singing the blues."
4,Children of the Flame,"I believe high school kids should read this to realize what has happened in history,especially WW11. This book was so truthful and interesting. How these Jewish people survived after the was is so beyond me. Menegele was not human. How he could do what he did, and turn around and still love the twins. (children)."
2,A History of Mengele,"When I picked up this book I was excited to read about the Twins of Auschwitz. I have never seen any other book or information about them. However, this book is more about Mengele's life, from birth to death, with brief quotations from the Twins thrown in. Only about 40 pages of the book actually took place in Auschwitz-Birkenau. If you are looking about information on Mengele, you may find this to be an interesting read. If you are interested in the Twins of Auschwitz or information about the concentration camp, this book offers little information."
5,Excellent Holocaust Revelation,"As I am a twin, I have always been interested in any written accounts of multiples. The descriptions of how each felt about the experience and how some differed between twins and among the group were quite interesting and revealing."
4,Children of the Flames,"Excellent book. A little boring in the beginning when describing Mengele's childhood, but it more than makes up for it later on. Great book overall, just a little short."
3,A Pretty Good Read,"This is a factual, readable, and thought-provoking book about Mengele's twin experiments at Auschwitz. I was VERY frustrated that in all of the photos in the book, there was not one of Mengele himself. There was a lot of description about his appearance, but no picture of the man. Also, while the post-war stories of the twins was fascinating, the actual ""experiments"" performed were not described in any detail. The horror of the man and his actions is real, but why he was so horribly depraved is glossed over or never mentioned. Why did some of these twins die? What had he done to them? The author never says, probably in an effort to appeal to a wider audience. What is here is good, but there is just not enough here. Some of the photos of twins in the book are never connected to text telling their stories."
3,Should be titled something else since you barely get inside on the twins life in Auschwitz.,"I bought this book expecting it to have testimonal points from the twins. However most of it if not 90% of the book is about Dr.Mengele's life. I was looking forward on getting direct insight on the twins and the experiments they endured but it was hardley talked about at all. Their input is mostly about life after Auschwitz. The way the book is written is odd as well. It will jump from a quote from one twin back to a narrative form of Mengele's life back to a different twin, and yet another twin. Twins testimoney is not even one full page anywhere in the book, there at most one paragraph to a few.However if you are more interested on reading about Mengele's life than this book is appropriate for you."
4,More About Mengele Than The Twins . . . .,"It took me years to get up the nerve to read this book. I don't even know for sure why I wanted to read it. Holocaust books make me ill. Finally, a few months ago, I did read ""Children of the Flames"". Fortunately, there were not too many graphic descriptions of the ""medical"" experiments, so I could make it through the whole book. Towards the end, however, it seemed far more like a book on Mengele than on the twins. It started reading like a book on Mengele's ""retirement years"". And I don't feel Ms. Lagnado and Mrs. Dekel were the best writers for that job. They did not go anywhere near as deep into the psyche of Josef Mengele as they should have. I think they should have just concentrated on the twins' stories, and their memories of the doctor, and left Josef Mengele's life story to those with keener knowledge and deeper insight about the nature of his evilness."
4,Haunting,"Comprised of the memories of some of the surviving twins, this book also includes photographs of them before and after the war -- totally eye-opening.Obviously, this book is incredibly depressing, and for that reason very difficult to get through. However, it was an aspect of World War II about which I hadn't known much before, and suspect that others don't, as well.No matter how much you might hate some ethnic group, I don't see how anyone could be so inhumane as to torture and dismember this way. People are people, no matter what.I always marvel at how these people can go on to live regular lives. I'm sure that once a person experiences such horrifying ordeals, the scars will never go away emotionally -- but even to give the outward appearance of going on? Takes an incredibly brave person."
3,MIU France Wine Glasses - a higher standard.,These glasses continue to impress guests. They are obviously manufactured to a higher standard than most and are frequently mistaken for heavier glassware. A great item for serving wine at outdoor functions especially around the pool.
1,Disappointment,"I have been very disappointed in this product. If I could return them, I would. I purchased this product because a friend of mine has some polycarbonate wine glasses which she has had for several years and that still look like new. She even washes them in the dishwasher. I have only had these for about 6 weeks and have only used them about 4-5 times. Each time I have hand washed them, but they are very cloudy and I am embarrassed to use them. I would not recommend them."
2,Not as expected,"Based on the favorable reviews and the other MIU quality products I own, I expected much more. The seams are clearly visible and they look like thick plastic, not glass. One came scratched in the box. Now I wish I had only ordered one set."
2,Not my personal pick...,"This is a recording from Klaus Schulze's 1980s 'MIDI' period, which also includes the better 'Miditerranean Pads' and 'Angst', either of which would be a better choice than this album. The music here seems rather unfocussed for Schulze, normally a very on-point composer, and the vocal on the final track is a downright mistake, right up there with the vocals on Tangerine Dream's ""Cyclone"" in terms of tactical errors. Your money would do better if spent elsewhere on Klaus's work."
4,Buen CD,"Es una demostracion adicional de lo que es capaz Schulze, ahora adentrandose bien en una fase clasica (distinto a goes classic, nada bueno). Importante, se debe tener como una faceta mas de las caras de este musico sorprendente"
3,not quite there yet,"The second offering from Trip Shakespeare (first with Matt's brother Dan) is a hit-and-miss record--much like their first. While there are a few great tunes, like ""Two-Wheeler"", ""Diane"" and ""Toolmaster From Brainerd"", the album still lacks the magic they would create on their two subsequent releases, ""Lulu"" and ""Across The Universe""."
5,a real gem,"wonderful collection, beautifully recorded. Music ranges from the sweet to haunting but always pleasing. Get it before it disappears You will not be disappointed"
1,I wouldn't buy it again,"The material seemed cheap and tore easily. It lasted about 2 months and now I'm shopping for something better. Oddly, the other one that I purchased the same day seems to be holding up a lot better ... for less than 1/2 the price."
5,Stunning!,"Former Extol lead guitarist, Ole Borud, shines in this digitally re-mastered, melodic death/doom breakthrough masterpiece. It is the opinion of this wittier that this is one of the best heavy metal albums ever (Christian or secular genre subdivisions irrelevant)!! Ole is a prodigy and a true master of the electric guitar. Schaliach encompasses some of Ole's most beautiful and well written guitar work. I get chills listening to this album like I do no other. You have to experience it to know what I'm talking about. Many have compared Schaliach to the Amorphis album - Tales from the 1000 Lakes. It is my opinion that, while Tales is an amazing album, Sonrise is the superior in every regard (songwriting, instrumentation, etc.). Any Amorphis fan would love this album, I promise! Ole, if you read this, I hope you and Peter might one day release another full length Schaliach album! It would be a dream come true!!"
1,Not forth coming!,No wonder these knobs were cheaper than other web sites. They didnt come with the screws!!! Now I have to go to the hardware store and spend who knows how much for the screws when I could have paid a little more and gotten the correct ones with the knobs!! Super disappointed!!!
2,Smelly multi vitamins,"These vitamins may be very effective and a great buy but their odor is very offensive. It's the first thing I notice when I take off the cap in the morning. The smell reminds me of the smell of DECAY...no kidding. In the future I'll buy a different, less-odorific, brand."
2,Not up to the usual standards,"Having purchased everything ever published by Dr. Ballard, I eagerly awatied this release. Upon first glance, the book appears to be every inch what his previous volumes have been, with the exception of the mediocre ""Explorations"".After reading this though, I can't call it more than a short compilation of his previous works on Midway and Gudalcanal, with short side trips to Pearl Harbor, Truk, and Bikini.There are very few photogrpahs of wrecks, certainly not anywhere near the amount in previous volumes...AND WHERE ARE KEN MARSCHALL's PAINTINGS? Overall, I felt rather underwhelmed. Bikini has been done better in ""Ghost Fleet"", and the Submeged Cultural Resource unit did a bettr job at Pearl Harbor.On the up side, there is one haunting internal photograph from the Arizona...hardly enough to recommend full retail for this book.Wait for it to be $4.99 in a few weeks if you simply must have it."
1,Disappointing,"This is the first book which I have purchased concerning shipwrecks. I expected many photographs with information concerning the wrecks. What the book actually contained are sappy attempts to tell stories of the battles and Ballard retelling how he has found previous wrecks. This book was more about Ballard blowing his own horn, and less about the ships which went down during WWII. Save your money!"
5,WW II History,"This book written by Dr. Robert Ballard the world renownedscientist, oceanographer and historian is a great read. The stories coupled with actual survivor interviews make it a must have for historical researchers.As a genealogical researcher I learned part of the true story of my Uncle T.D. Germany's experience on the U.S.S. Lexington during the battle of the Coral Sea. How he was wounded, given up for dead and rescued by his fellow commrades just moments before the Lady Lex was sunk to the abyss."
1,Didn't work long,I returned this and bought a full size cheaper model. It didn't work long and was difficult to use when it did.
2,Fellowes EXL45-2 Laminator,"The device works okay but limited to 5 mil (i.e. 0.005 inch or 0.127 mm) pouch thickness only. The advertised specs were inaccurate as it indicated ""Maximum pouch thickness of 5 millimeters"" when in fact it will only do 0.127 mm. How I wish the seller understood that 5 mm is not the same as 5 mils."
1,Where's my Customer Service?,"Laminator did not work properly. I email them letting them know that I needed a new one or for them to give me my money back. I Email the company the next day after receiving it, That was last month is Nov 22 and they still haven't contact me on how can I get a new one or my money back. Very Bad customer service. I'm sure the laminator could be a good product, but why am I still waiting? Why do I still have this crappy laminator that don't work?!"
1,Get what you pay for,Used it the first time and business card got stuck. Fed another card in to try to push first card out and and that got stuck. Fed third card and pushed first two out. The next two totally melted. Ended up throwing the machine in the trash.
4,small laminating machine,"Lovely machine, had to pay customs fee to postie, needed a transformer as different voltage and plug, my stupidity but finally got it up and running.....!"
1,A Real Loser,This was delivered without the starter pack and without the carrier. Had no way to try it out. Returned to sender.
2,Expected more from Fellowes,"This model worked well two times, laminating business card sized items using 5mil plastic. I cleaned the roller after each pass using Fellowes cleaning paper as directed. The third time, using 3mil plastic the item jammed in the roller where it is stuck forever. Don't buy this model. I recommend spending a little more and purchase a full size laminator, which can be opened to clean the rollers and remove jams."
2,didn't last long,"Received the laminator and everything started out fine. However since the instructions that came with the machine were not for that model, the cleaner paper jammed. Fellows Co. was called and they replaced the machine with one that had the correlating instruction sheet."
1,BLECH,"Disappointing. I was hoping for a CD, the contents of which would be actual ritual, etc. Instead, I received something that appears to be a cross between an Andrew Lloyd Webber Musical and a David Bowie song.I do not recommend it."
5,Superfly like Wynona from good times.,Classic from back in the day. I can still listen to this album and jam out. Pick up a copy and get introduced to some groovy licks and catchy hooks from the veterans of Fuzz Rock.
2,"Dry and brown, should be green","This arrived dried out and brown, I had to throw it away. When it's fresh it is a nice green color."
5,lost in mail,"Dear Amazon,I would love nothing more than to review this movie. It has now been 21 since i ordered this movie."
1,"Tao, Schmao","This isn't a book. It's a farce. It's actually a collection of mostly one-line quotes -- one per page in this epic tome -- pilfered from local newspapers in Seattle and Tacoma. The great pearls of ""wisdom"" being described here as some form of simplistic genius are little more than a series of trite quotes offered up by one of Ichiro's translators. Save the dough and do a web search for ""Ichiro"" on the Seattle Times or PI website. You'll have 90 percent of the text for free. This is a shameless attempt to cash in on the guy's instant celebrity status. You'll find deeper insights into baseball and life on the back of a cereal box."
4,good toy,"this toy would of been great if i didn't get it damaged, i sent it back for a refund and amazon still has not refund it, plus the other arc170 fighter vehicle i sent back is still not refunded yet. disappointing"
2,Thought it was better...,"Before buying the album I only heard 1 song. When I heard the hole track list I was disappointed. They sound like a lot of other things that are out there, so If you like the ""same"" sound over and over again you might like it."
5,What a great Brit Rock Band,"I heard a couple songs on www.newbornmusic.com episode 1 and what a breath of fresh air. If your tired of the same old radio rock, check this band out. I just ordered the CD and can't wait to get it. The two songs I heard on newbornmusic.com were awesome."
2,Predictable Midly Boring Nice Scenery,"If you like novels with footnotes this is the right book for you. If on the other hand you prefer an interesting plot and lively characters this might not make the top of your list. Erdman is a fine scholar and sets a nice picture of wartime Switzerland, other than that this is a dry book that offers predictable plot devices and little character development"
1,not what I was looking for,"I recently read Zero Coupon and The Set-Up by Erdman. Both were similar to what I expect from a Grisham or Frey novel, and were what I was looking for, as well as being very exciting and interesting. The Swiss Account just never grabbed my interest, and was a long, plodding journey through what felt like 1,000 pages. If you are looking for a fact based novel, go for it. If you want an exciting beach or commuting book, forget about it."
2,Not typical Erdman quality,"I'm a big fan of Erdman and recently got all the books I have not read yet by Erdman. This is the worst book I have read by Erdman. I guess if you are fascinated by WWII history and like reading a history book versus a novel, then this book may be for you. Erdman usually mixes in the appropriate amount of historical detail in his books, but he mixed in too much in this book."
5,Great product!,I have been using this product for years on chicken and steak and it is great! My daughter has grown up using this and now is moving out and wanted her own! She loves this because it takes the guess work out of whether the chicken is done or not!
3,Food Thermometer,"This was my 1st food thermometer purchase, so I cannot compare it to others. The item is ok. It gives a reading with colors, but it can be confusing, as when the meat is rare it does read red, which is ok, but when it is med, it seems all the colors appear, not sure if that is ok with me. But I just started to use it. Perhaps I might prefer something that gives a readout with actual temperature"
2,Disappointed...,"This sounded like such a good idea. My 8 year old read a bout this product in ""Boys Life"" magazine and I thought, hey, what a great use of old crayons, of which we have way too many. I gave it 2-3 stars because we liked the concept, but the execution was poor. The first one I bought didn't even melt the crayons so we returned it. The second one melted the crayons successfully but no matter how we tried, it never really worked well in filling the mold. We tried a number of different times, allowing the crayons to melt longer and shorter times, etc. but nothing made a difference. The second product will be returned shortly..."
4,Strong Short Narrative of Growth and Life,"Nice short narrative dwelling with dexterity in the legitimate and naive passions of growing up as one understands, or finally misunderstands with a reason, the adult world that awaits.Fante offers a solidly written portrait of a young boy struggling to grow up against the hard working class landscape set by his family. He does so with a rich sense of humbleness and authenticity that makes the story rather cogent and with a strong resonance that still rings relevant.While maybe not a book for the ages this is a good volume. For me, in fact, it is circumstantially the first Fante I read after many recommendations, and it leaves a rather intriguing taste on my palate with an eagerness to read some more. (Thanks Vicky)"
2,Unimportant passages and superficial homilies,"The goal of this book is laudable: to find short passages of traditional Jewish commentaries that can be explained to readers with modest religious knowledge. But the passages chosen usually offer little insight into either religion or life. Furthermore, the D'rashim seem oriented to children more than adults; they verge on the corny."
5,The Real Harry,"This is a great documentary on one of the most talented artists who is not really known to the general public. Most people know Harry Nilsson by two songs, 'Everybody's Talkin' and 'Without You'. But Nilsson recorded a great body of work which really reflected his incredible talent. The documentary showed what a great talent he was and the incredible people he encountered in his life like the Beatles, the Monkees, Keith Moon and others, and the tragedy of how this talent slipped away through excess. Everything you always wanted to know about Harry Nilsson you'll find in this film. A friend who saw the film who only knew a little bit about Nilsson loved it so much she started collecting his music. Hopefully, this will be the end result for everyone who sees this movie."
5,great detail of an artist's path,"i just thought he had a cool record out when I was a teen. This film adds so many layers. I'd rent this again. Loved the Beatles element, too."
1,Poor quality book for such a talented architect,"I purchased this book after having purchased the monacelli press one house issue of the turtle creek residence. I was hoping to find a book filled with drawings and sketches as the previously mentioned title; however, what I found was a book filled with page after page of actual pictures. The actual drawings in the book were reduced to little more than 2 in. X 2 in. plans of really poor quality. Save your money and look for another book."
5,Excellent instructor,"Having taken a class with Bruce, and getting to know him during my training with his company. I am sure that this will be a great book. Bruce is very dedicated to making sure his students enjoy the class, and understand the topics at the same time"
2,something helpful but don't expect too much..,"I have read this book since last Oct. At that time, there were not too much CCIE books you could choose and I was kind of new to this area.Last month I passed the CCIE Written Test and now is head on lab exam preparation with sold foundation about internetworking system.As I looked back to this book and the reviews on this site, I felt that this book really provides something helpful in the way for troubleshooting methodoligy and frame relay. But for CCIE lab or Written Test, it might not be helpful too much.You have to look for more resource to prepare yourself. Everyone with diierent backgound may have different view about this book. I'm sure that once you find something different from couple months ago about this book, you really learned a lot of things !"
5,Very good condition,I received this book within about 2 weeks after my order. It's in near new condition. I am satisfied.
3,Second edition is not much better than the first.,"This is just your typical technical book. Spelling errors galore, terrible grammar, confusing sentence structure, ambiguous statements, and just plain errors of fact. If you've read your share of tech books, you know what I'm talking about. The book feels like it was rushed to the marketplace without someone actually sitting down and reading it.This is definitely not an introductory book, although at times it seems like one. The authors make simple stuff sound confusing and harder than it actually is. Sometimes they repeat the same stuff over and over in the same chapter. And a lack of illustrations makes the complex stuff even more incomprehensible than it already is.But if your're serious about getting your ccie, then this is certainly a book you want on your bookshelf."
2,"That was then, this is now...","I started my CCIE lab studies with this book in 2000, it was an easy read and I really liked this book, specifically the Frame Relay section which still applies to today's lab. But, I had to put a hold on studies for a while.I started my CCIE studies again in 2002 and passed the lab in 2003. During that time I glanced at this book for a total of 20 minutes. There are simply so many other books by CiscoPress that are better than this one, although, again, the Frame Relay section very well done. But certain sections, such as switching, token ring, and quite a few others simply don't apply anymore. Also, the Lab exam is so different now, with 3550's, QoS, Multicast galore, that this book falls of the required reading list.I do think the author did a great job on this book initially, but it needs a facelift of major proportions."
2,Nothing on 3550s,The lab has changed but the book hasn't. Don't waste your money on this out-dated book.
1,"I read a few chapters of this book, and felt cheated.","I read a few chapters of this book, and felt cheated thus far. I would suggest you to go to the bookstore and read some chapters and see if this fits your personal reference."
4,Great reference and exam prep guide.,"Apart from being a good exam prep guide, it's an excellent desktop resource and reference to do your everyday job. My only disapointment is in some of the poor grammar scattered through the book, which hopefully will be rectified in the next edition."
5,"Unique, eclectic, yet very cohesive","This is a piece of history for me, as I got it when I wasn't really enjoying much electronic style music at the time. But this blends acoustic instruments (mainly woodwind) and electronics into a perfect web of beauty and charm. Very traditional German electronic at times, but with a very cool ""other worldly"" touch.The previous review gives a wonderful description of each song, so I won't go into them, but the overall effect is a soothing journey through a myriad of colors and rhythms.My only complaint would be that I wish someone would remaster Irmin Schmidt's entire catalog of music, as it needs a bit of an upgrade. But, this is a thankful acquisition as my vinyl copy is too precious to over play, and this is one of those beautiful yet enlightening albums that never tires or gets dated.A fine example of the diverse world of German electronic music."
5,A CD for the desert island,"I am grateful to the previous reviewers whose comments made me buy this recording. As one reviewer points out, Zinka Milanov sounds matronly. But what the hell is wrong with a matron who is the owner of a voice of such ravishing beauty, having power, bite AND a famous pianissimo?! I think this is her best recorded Tosca. Franco Corelli has a voice that might give you a heart attack and he makes Maria Callas' favorite partner, di Stefano, sound like a tenorino.The exciting and huge voiced GianGiacomo Guelfi is the eptiome of Scarpia. Sir Alexander Gibson's conducting, though not at par with the justly famous DeSabata recording, is very acceptable, and so is the mono sound of this live recording.Simply a must have !"
1,Outrageous pricing - used plates more expensive than listing price of the new plate,"Replacements do cost you a lot but that they will cost you more than the list price is unpleasantly surprising, but this seller will shock you even more by putting the price of the used plates higher than the list price."
5,S Club Juniors rule,I just love the S Club Juniors and their voices. Even though they are from 12-14 while you may think the lyrics are babyish the lyrics are not babyish and their voices are incredable. I love the song automatic high and i have to listen to it every day. I also like the other songs which are the karoke version of Automatic High and We Got You and I'd rate them a 10/10. I liked this albaum becaus eht elyrics are great and their voices are wonderful. If you need to hear the songs before you buy this (....) and you can hear the single Automatic High and the single One Step Closer. I definetly think you should buy this CD and if you do you wont regret it.
5,supa dupa,"This song is wiked, really summery, and makes you want 2 dance along, the other songs are just as good, if you like it you should buy ""together"" their album wich as songs even beat than this, but it is a lil bit cheesy,if you buy there brand new album ""Sundown"" you can see how their voices have matured, and the songs r 2wice as gd wich i thought was impossible, calvins voice has broken so they sound much older! :)"
2,not even close,"While i already enjoyed Automatic High...i figured why not get this other disc and see what its about. Not much especially not ""We Got You"" uggh the song is horrible and insepid. I know they are kids here but it would have been sooo much better if they didnt try to rap on this song at all. It drags the song down even though it wasnt all that good to begin. It makes this song unbearable to listen to more than once which i won't ever do. I normally like S Club Juniors (or 8 as i call em)...but this one is a letdown in a BIG way....steer clear off and avoid at all costs."
5,Automatic High,"This track is really summery, and, although i really like all the juniors songs, this has to be my faveorite. Even though the juniors are young (12-15) they are full of talent and Frankies voice sounds very mature. I would recomend it to anyone who likes a good sing-along-track!"
2,Stating the obvious,"Julie Marsh Nelson comes up with all kinds of things that are known to everybody who has not only seen a few horror movies, but movies in general. I learned very, very little."
2,Boring Expert on Horror Story,"This woman obviously knows what she's talking about, but she is incredibly boring. She offers insightful looks into the genres, especially horror, and how they blend. She uses excellent examples to illustrate some of her points. But she's academic, tends to shotgun her ideas, instead of focusing on the craft of screenwriting, and it must be said, it's sometimes difficult to follow her train of thought. If you can stay awake through her lecture, you'll learn a thing or two."
2,A failure experience,"This one does look cute,but is not comfortable to walk at all.I went for a half smaller size than usual but still have problems when walk a lot.I suggest trying on before purchasing online for this kind of wedges with ties."
1,Strategies for the 21st century?,"In this book you will find NO answers to questions like ""How the airline business and the aviation markets of this century will look like"". Instead of future aspects and ideas you can read all about the very basics in airline economics. But that's not enough. Most of the facts and figures are from the mid 90's. Poor! Bottom line: The title doesn't match with the content at all!"
5,One of the Best Military Authors to Date,"I have read them all from Clancy to Brown and LtCol.(Ret) Scott is by far one of the best military writers to date. My father served in Vietnam and after he came back my mom said he was never the same and I always wondered what it was like, why men like my father and Col Scott, why they went when they were called knowing they might not return and those that did would be forever altered. I joined the infantry at 17 to see for myself and after serving in Panama and Somalia I understand. Col. Scott says it best in the books with way he connects you to the characters you come to realize they did it for the men to their left and their right, not so much for America, but the men who represent America. Sad to know that he won't be writing anymore books but the four vietnam books he wrote are some of the greatest military fiction ever written and in my opinion should be required reading for all young soldiers and leaders."
4,Although Fictional Scott Writes Factual,"Leonard B. Scott writes another excellent book probably relating much of his own personal experience in Viet Nam. Again he sets up his main characters detailing what they left behind only to have everything they knew and understood here in the U.S. tested and in many instances left in some far off jungle in Viet Nam. Mr. Scott, though he was an officer, describes Army life among the enlisted troops with great clarity and understanding. He may be a Mustang (enlisted later becoming anofficer) whatever, I have enjoyed reading all of his Viet Nam Era Army books and would rate this one just as good as The Expendables. The vocabulary he uses is of that era and adds in his effort to recreate life back in the late 1960's. A Must Read if you like Scott's writings."
5,"What can I say, but what a great book.",The way that Scott writes the story to the hill is extravagant. Not only do you see the one side perspective from the Brothers you also get to see it from the Vietnamese side. As one knows you need to know the two sides of the coin in order to get the real truth. This book like SCott's others is truly something else.
5,"Great character development, great story","Ironically, I picked this book up at the bargin bin in a St. Petersburg, Russia. Starting out in Oklahoma, it shows the progression from state college football, to OCS, through Ranger and Airborne training to the jungles of Vietnam. Two brothers, taking different paths through the Army."
5,BEAUTIFUL!!,"This tree arrived well-packed and full of blossoms, and leaves. Just gorgeous! Unfortunately, all the leave have fallen off and the blossoms have dried up and have begun to fall off as well. I'm hoping that's just shock from the trip as it has LOTS of new growth coming in. I'll do some more research to make sure I'm doing everything right and hope for the best! At this point, it looks as though it will make a full recovery over the Spring and Summer. I'll update later!"
4,Good Target Net for Bck yard,"Good one. difficult to assemble with one person only. Also, I wish this was made portable."
3,some good songs...worth getting,There a few good songs on this...its worth getting just for the song P9
1,Nothing compelling,If you have read any other e-business book then you do not need to read this one. It is already somewhat dated and only provides a general overview. If you are an extreme beginner this might be a good text.
1,A disappointment if you make your living with the Internet.,"If you are looking for something new, from those who profess to know where our networked world is going, then you will be disappointed in this book. Mainly a rehash of ""the net will be everything and everthing will be the net"" stuff that most people who seriously study the internet and the networked world, quit writing (I thought) a couple of years ago. I recommend this book to people who need a few nifty buzz words and ideas to toss out at parties, but don't look here to find anything new or substantial on which to base the future of your career or business."
4,Nice Mug for Camping,"We bought these mugs for camping trips and they are excellent. Just right for early morning cups of coffee and hot chocolate, while breathing the cool mountain air. We like to warm the cups on the grill, while heating the water for hot beverages. We also use the mugs for water while brushing teeth and I use them for rinsing the dishes. The quality is top-notch. The only reason I didn't rate the mugs with five stars is that I wish they were slightly larger, say 12 oz."
1,Enamel dissolves in juice (anything acidic),"Bought this for my preschooler, wanted something cheaper than stainless but not plastic or glass. Noticed after a couple days of use one of the cups had a weird white coating in the bottom that wouldn't wash out, but turns out that was the surface of the enamel after 30 minutes of exposure to pineapple juice. Tested with some vinegar on the bottom as well to confirm the acid theory, discolored and became rough after only a few minutes. Don't know if it's dangerous but don't want kid drinking whatever was dissolving off. It's a shame because they seem pretty nice otherwise and do work well over a fire (no perceived outgasing-chemical odor) just remember no acidic juice! Hate to do it, but gave it one star because this seems like an obvious thing to test for and should have been either fixed or disclosed in the ad."
2,Mug chipped,I really like the look of these mugs. They are smaller and lighter than the average mug. With that said one of the mugs came chipped. It seems it would be a head ache to exchange so I will just deal with it. Not too happy.
4,Cant wait to get to the campfire,The coleman mugs I purchased will make the campfire even more enjoyable with a warm beverage. Can't wait to get to the campfire
2,"Expected the Best, Didn't Get It","I ordered this for a machining course at school and for work. I bought Starrett because they're known for quality. Everybody at work recommended them or Brown and Sharpe. However when I got my dial caliper, I found that the slide is extremely stiff, making it very hard to use. Yes, I checked to make sure the position was not locked in place. Don't know if it's designed this way (I doubt it) or if it's a manufacturing defect. All I know is that every slide caliper I have used in the past has a very smooth slide. As for the calibration and accuracy, I was able to machine several small parts for a small scaled engine to specifications, so it performed great in that area. I have returned my caliper and will try another manufacturer. Yes, I only give companies one shot. This is why I like Craftsman and Snap On for my handtools, and Chicago Latrobe for my drills."
1,Was sent a 1202-6,"I ordered the 120A-6 caliper expecting a wonderful piece of precision measuring equipment. Phillips Steel Company sent me the 1202-6 which is an expensive Chinese made POS. The caliper came in a nice Starrett box and plastic case. Inside the plastic case the caliper was nicely sealed in a plastic bag. The first time I opened the caliper, the needle didn't move. I closed the caliper, the needle still didn't move. Then I tilted the caliper in the process of putting it down on the table and the needle fell off the post inside the dial! Those are the facts, you make the call. BTW the folks at Phillips Steel Company were wonderful to deal with, the fault is in the computers at Amazon. Phillips doesn't even sell the 120A-6 through Amazon. As a courtesy I tried to explain this to Amazon, but the drone on the phone kept telling me to talk to Phillips Steel Company. The Amazon drone was dumber than a box of rocks. Returning the item for refund."
4,Mid-range Caliper at a Great Price,"This was the least expensive Starrett dial caliper I found while searching the seemingly small number of dealers (the average price for this model from other dealers was at least $140.) I don't think I need to comment much of the quality of the product since the Starrett name generally speaks for itself. I will just say that I am completely satisfied with its quality and performance. Be advised that this product comes graduated only in English units (inches), no metric. Additionally, the storage case is very... red. Overall this product is an EXTREMELY good values for its price."
4,Great use for students,"I've used this in my tool construction class at high school and it's great. Smooth movement, locks tight, always keeps its measurement all the time. (trust me after the freshman got to it. I was suprized it still kept it's accuracy on the dot. Personally I sdy Starret tools are good for the money. not the most exspensive not the cheapest but just right. It's your money's worth trust me."
1,Junk,Junk! It is at the manufacture. Broken!! Do not buy. A waste of money. Used one time. Not worth the price.The manufacture now wants $87.50 to repair plus $7.00 shipping. I was using it for the first time and dropped itfrom waist level!
1,worst calipers ever!,"i do not know why since starrett is known for its well made measuring equiptment, but these are the worst pair of calipers i have ever owned the needle scratchs the dial face and the replacement set was out of calibration so badly they will never be corrected. i had to send back the replacement pair for a refund. the whole thing has me asking if they really even were authentic starrett calipers."
3,"Shaky technically, but a good budget colleciton","I don't admire Jarvi as a conductor, so it surprised me that I mostly enjoyed this colleciton of somewhat ragged but spirited performances. The Oedipus Rex in particular woke me up in spots, and all the other performances showed dramatic interest. The orchestra isns't up to a good American orchestra like cincinnati or Pittsburgh, but you can sitll hear an echo of its glory days under Ansermet--it wasn't very good technically then, either, but there was a heap of style to make up for that."
5,Great. A love story with real characters.,"This is the kind of story that is easy to get into and hard to put down, and leaves you with warm feelings when you're done. The characters remain with me, so completely alive"
2,Ok for ideas,"I thought this would give me some great ideas for my kids' playroom, but truthfully, I didn't really find that much here. Rather than spend the money, I would probably get a copy from the library or jump online for ideas."
2,Not informative!,I got this book with the hopes of being inspired to add some extra touches to my two girl's rooms. Save your money... their catalog is better than this book. It isn't filled with much decorating or project information at all. It is also very redundant. If you are looking for 10 ways to create a chalk board on various objects then this book is for you. If you are looking to be inspired with new idea pass on this one!
4,Fantastic & Simple,Fantastic and simple ideas. Most of them you can do it all alone without any cost.
3,A few nice rooms,"This book features a few nice rooms but it only features two bedrooms, one for either sex. The berooms are lovely but this is not a great reference book if you are after lots of inspiration. Much of the info is common sense for most people too. I collect books on kids rooms so like it for my library sake, it is well phoyographed and will do as a quick flick occasionally but there are better books if you want lots of theme ideas and variety."
4,"Lacks the energy of their live show, but still damn good.","I happened to catch these guys open for fIREHOSE in `93, and man, they blew me away. Unfortunately, the power of their live performance isn't quite preserved on the album, but ""Could Ya Would Ya"" is still a great rock and roll song and the sweetness of ""Kiss the Night"" and ""So Long"" continue to stop me in my tracks just as much as fIREHOSE's ""In Memory of Elizabeth Cotton."" Give it a listen."
2,Heads Up!,Does NOT come with a Memory Card that is needed in order for it to work. Memory card sold separately.
2,I don't like the listed price!,"Just a quick FYI- I just went to target and bought this same item for $30. It's a Christmas present for my daughter- so I have no idea on the quality yet, but I know I will feel a lot better knowing I didn't spend an extra $40 for this if she does break it."
1,Problems like the rest.,"My daughter received this as a Christmas present and finally opened it this week. I loaded it up with memory and fresh batteries. The camera after a quick setup would stop working when the shutter button was pushed. The LCD would still work, but all other buttons were in-op. Frustrated, I looked up the reviews on Amazon and found plenty of people with the same problems.Solution: I found the warranty card and called the (800) number for help. Calling on a Sunday I was surprised when someone picked up. The solution after a quick procedure of taking the battery and memory card out for the gentleman over the phone was to send me a new unit. I will update my review when I get the new camera in a few weeks."
3,Cool but didn't come with SD card,Gave this to my niece for Christmas and she was so excited to open it. But we couldn't use it right away because it did not come with the SD card needed to use the device. I would have liked to pay more so that it came ready to use.
1,Beware!!!!!! Not compatible with Stilletto2.,Beware!!!!!!I bought this for my Stiletto2 and it is not compatible. The Stilletto 2 won't fit on this even though everything you see makes it look like it would.I'm out $30+/- shipping.The fact that the Stiletto Executive System is not compatible with the Stilletto2 is not noted anywhere on the info for this.
1,Didn't work long,The sound stopped functioning on this product very soon after we received it so it had to be returned.
3,Good for the ASL proficient,"Not suitable for students starting to study ASL. Audio quality is poor, therefore difficult to follow. Very well signed. Some reference material (or closed captioning) on the words being signed in ASL (not english translation) would be of great help for students trying to become better in learning ASL."
3,:Audentity: Not Great,In 1982 Schulze made this music. It requires concentration. It has a hallmark of a continuous stream of sound which varies slightly by degrees and altering the rhythm accordingly. The presence of contributing players fleshes out the material much as Tangerine Dream did. Some critics say Audentity is an interesting and engrossing work. I found it hard to listen to.
5,avantgarde,"A double album from early eighties. Not for everyone, but those who are familiar with Schulze and abstract/electronic music will appreciate this recording."
3,Half Good!,"Klaus's mid period was hurt by his over use of digital beat. Mostly simple thud thud thud beats. On this his third album into digital territory he really should have released a single disc as half of it offers us nothing new just bland thud thud oooo- thud etc.. However for the brave he dropped the beat box for two excellent classical inspired tracks. On disc one, Amourage 10:37 min and on disc two Sebastian im traum at 28:21 min. If you can wade through the sometimes painful {stuff} around them they are worth owning."
2,Somehow it does not jell really!,"Though the author brings about some important facts like the connection between the Bon religion and Parsis somehow the book does not really jell. It could be because the author does not speak of his own experiences - one gets a teeny weenie feeling that he is writing under some duress or pressure. May be asked by Chinese Govt. not to mention the unmentionables or that the book has been edited, rather severely, by the publishers. Something is wrong somewhere! Only those who're interested in the Bon religion can refer this book! Vacuous! Ineffective! Though the subject matter is really very good."
5,Excellent - but no dub track,"This is a short, yet excellent film.However, the film is only subtitled - and it's got a high price.It's been a year since I watched the Blu-Ray, but the visuals are outstanding, and I don't remember anything more un-family-friendly than that of watching The Goonies.This movie is great for someone who likes classic adventure tales, however tons of older kids are missing out because there is no dub (English language) soundtrack - and they would likely be too bored to attempt a subtitled film.Because the price is so high, likely not many people bothered to buy this, thus it may never see a licensed dub - anytime soon."
4,"For Now & Forever"", 10 psychedelic, 60's-influenced tunes","KMB is a band with a long future ahead of it. The band's success has been so overwhelming that it has led to the creation of a record label named after it. KMB's style is at times British while still American spirited. Songs like ""Love is in the air"" start out slow and then knock you right off your feet, while others, like ""In the End"" take you off to dream-land.PS Look for their new release ""For Now & Forever Remixed"" coming out in summer of 2003."
3,decent b-sides,"""Don't Panic"" is a great song, but that's not why you're considering buying this CD; if so, get ""Parachutes,"" the whole album. You're here for the b-sides. Both are live recordings, but they sound very professional. ""You Only Live Twice"" is a good take on the Bond-movie title song; nicely adapted to fit the band's style, while remaining true to the spirit of the original. ""Bigger Stronger"" is even better, an aggressive rocker that must have been great in concert. Do these two songs add up to enough to make them worth the price of the single? If you're a big Coldplay fan, then definitely. If you're only a casual fan, you might want to try and hear the songs first, then make a decision."
5,Another Jedi closer to a complete arena,"Pablo Jill can be seen in the Geonosis Arena igniting his saber near Kit Fisto. He looks great in an arena environment, however, he's also great to sit (with a little effort) on the Jedi Council. His hands seem to detach easily, but other than that, he's a great addition to your army of jedi."
3,Great Book - Poor Kindle Copy,"All of Major Ian Thomas' books and sermons are packed with Truth, and worth a lifetime of study and application.Unfortunately this Kindle copy suffers from lack of simple editting to remove errors introduced by the digitizing process. So buy the hard copy instead."
5,Grest Book,Great explanations of difficult to understand parts of The Bible. Recommend to read to anyone who is interested in understanding of Bible.
5,An absolute must for every Christian.,"It was a no brainer that The Indwelling Life of Christ would be good, since it was given to me as a gift from the most inspiring man & minister that I've ever known in 37 years. He is now 82 and still serving the lowest and teaching the highest...truly ""Jesus with skin on"". This is the man that gave me this book. Get it. I say no more."
3,Couldn't get past the sample.....,"As much as I would have liked to purchase this book and read more, I just couldn't. Reading this sample was worse than reading a freshman's term paper. The typos and misspellings seemed gross in their frequency. This seems to be the case with many e-publications."
3,Moving Story,"I love the characterizations. I wish the editor had done a better job in finding typos - correct words, but incorrect placement - i.e., know rather than known...A troubling time to be a young woman."
2,Dont waste your money....sound quality is crap,You'd be a fool to waste your money on this.....regardless of the fact it is a HDCD....it was obviously a poor quality soundboard tape......the vocals are so overdriven....they actually burp.......the music isnt all that bad......for recorded quality......but if you really must buy it....just get a cheap used copy......I spent $5.99 for mine used...and that was even too much.
3,Only for collectors... regardless,"Nice to hear this after so many years, but I'm sure there must be some better recordings in the archives from this early KC Band (b/4 they split up). Fun to hear a couple of times, but worth a CD release next to the USA Live Recording?Sorry no comparison, I've had the USA LIVE Vinyl since it came out. Awesome performance... that is the one live album the Great Deceiver Box Set was aiming for, but did not include.Don't waste your time (except if you must have all things KC), buy USA LIVE instead (that is KC at it's best)."
4,Poor sound quality -- excellent perfomances,"This album is an excellent performace by an early seventies lineup of King Crimson. The sound quality is very poor but all four members of the band contribute to some fine jazz-rock jamming. We all know what became of Robert Fripp, but the other three members of the band all went on to greater success -- Mel Collins played on the Rolling Stones' Miss You, Boz Burrell joined Mott the Hooples' Mick Ralphs in Bad Company, and Ian Wallace played with Bob Dylan's late seventies line up. Fripp and Collins are the principle soloists on this album, and it is interesting to compare where all four of these musicians were then, and where they are now. Groon sounds like tape squauk, but the rest of the album is riviting"
3,Well..................,I'm not really a big fan of this era Crim but this is great music!Sound is not that good though.Even my HDCD version sounds like a bootleg but I think that's because the source material was originally a bootleg.For diehards only IMHO
2,A diatribe on the incredibly nerdy,"I understand that the public perception on RPG gamers/LARPers is the stereotypical portrait of a nerd -- socially awkward, nasally-voiced and no confidence. Unfortunately, it feels like the producers of this documentary purposely sought out the color-by-numbers stereotype of the Dungeons and Dragons gamer. Most of the gamers I have dealt with have been generally socially developed, and gaming is simply another social hobby -- the way poker or fantasy sports appeal to others. Sure, there is definitely the incredibly nerdy subculture within the gaming community, but films like this make it look like they are the majority. It just seemed like pandering to stereotypes."
2,Depressing,"I have to say that this documentary was very depressing to me. It made larpers and D&D; players out to be losers with sad , failed lives that were rejecting reality for a fantasy world. While most of us may indulge in different hobbies for the escapism from day to day stress we do manage to have fulfilling relationships, work a day job and are generally happy. But the people that were portrayed in this film were just so depressing.There was no 'fun' aspect of role playing that was really shown beside the dressing up, but even then not much focus was given to that aspect. I would also like to add that I do not participate in any of these types of games but seeing how DM masters are portrayed , it makes it not even fun to see people so power hungry that they have to ruin a game experience for others. ( I am talking about the overweight guy who is in the army reserve that walked out on his first family . He was very irritating to watch )"
1,Terrible Image of Gaming,"The documentary features the absolute worst of gamers and gaming. WatchThe Gamers: Dorkness Risingfor a much more educational, honest, and entertaining movie about role-playing games."
4,A good representation of a fair amount of gamers,"Although perhaps representative of the extremes of gaming, it is really not so far off base. I have played since i was about 8, and am now 39. I have seen plenty of normal people who played, including quite a few ex military, who learned to play during their downtime while still serving in the military. However, each group generally also has a few people who genuinely live for the moments where they can be somebody else, and have glum lives outside of the game. So, while people might feel this movie is unfair, i dont. Actually, i enjoyed it quite a bit. Each of the three people the movie focused on reminded me of people i had played with. Also, it is worth noting that the people this movie followed around are actual people. Anyway, it was a good representation of lives spent playing games to escape reality, rather than to enhance it.Enjoy!"
3,"Not what I expected, but cool.","I was expecting to see more of a historical documentary on D&D, not to follow a few freaks around their daily lives and how their addiction to role playing games of all sorts has ruined them. But still cool. Makes you feel a lot better about yourself thats for sure. HA!"
4,Entertaining,"I agree w/ the other reviewers; the movie is a little exploitative, but I find myself watching it over and over for entertainment value.The movie itself is well-made, better made I would say than 'Uber-Goober' (another RPG centric documentary from a while back).I find myself empathizing but enjoying the ""cast"" for what they are. Enthusiastic hobbyists with varied backgrounds who I hope eventually slay their own personal dragons.Misc commentary:- There are some good songs in the documentary worth exploring...I've enjoyed looking them up and listening to the full versions:""When Company Comes"" - The Feelies""Ghosts of a Different Dream"" - Guided by Voices- I hope Mr. Crum doesn't give up on his novel."
5,Great characters = great movie,"The Dungeon Masters is a wonderful film that focuses on the lives of three people who are active in the world of role-playing games, specifically ""Dungeons and Dragons."" These are the sort of strong personalities that are perfect for a film; they are quirky, articulate, unusual, self-aware, and very sympathetic.The director does a great job of sharing their worlds with us without condescending or poking fun -- yet the movie has a lot of humor in it.I didn't know much about the ""D & D"" community before I saw this film and it didn't affect my appreciation. The movie focuses on the aspirations and lives of people who play the game -- not about the gameplay or rules of Dungeon and Dragons.If you liked ""King of Kong"" or other documentaries about non-mainstream characters I would strongly recommend this film to you."
4,Interesting,"The first disc of the two is great. I love the lyrics and the instruments are hypnotic. It has a goth feel, but it sounds like no other goth band that I have ever heard. I enjoyed the first disc so much that I bought three other Rasputina CDs. The second disc is interesting and consists of mostly talk of a political nature. It was good to hear once, but I can't see having it in the car or on an ipod as it isn't music driven.I would recommend this CD to anyone who wants a unique music experience. I can't compare it to there other CD's yet, but it is very good on it's own."
4,evolutionary work,"This album, more so than any other, expounds on the Rasputina mythology of 17th/8th century imagery interspersed with modern anachronisms. The sound diverges from the darker, ""gothy"" sound of earlier albums. Lots more dulcimer and upbeat melodies. Songs like ""retinue of moons"" really demonstrate Melora's talent."
4,Almost everybody has... has snail fever,"This is actually the first Rasputina album I have bought though I have heard some of their other tracks, which had made me curious about them in the first place.The other songs I had heard were either bare bones cellos, or spooky remixes. So, when I popped in this album I was caught by surprise, a very pleasant one. I sighed from relief, and began to sink into the rich and colorful sound of Oh Perilous World.The musical diversity on this album is incredible, and all these strange instruments and lyrics are mixed so well together. Cellos, guitars, pianos, sweeping vocals, it all adds up to an incredible album.I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who likes offbeat music, and who is tired of the same song structures from the radio. Very refreshing..."
4,I'm listening to it right now. . ..,". . .. and it is absolutely worth the buy, whether or not you are a fan of Pig. It's worth the price just for a few of the absolute gems in this album. I'm a fan of Buck-Tick too(but not as much of Soft Ballet), so having these guys collaborate is just awesome(Not to mention guesting from Meat beat Manifesto, and mixed by John Fryer)."
5,VERY good,"an excellent choice of a good chewy complex piece of music for the intellectually bored 'with the current music'This cd is very complex, dense and full of suprizes. I feel it has everything for everyone.Not recommended for those who like boy bands or plastic country music or pop music in general.Good to give as a gift, intro someone into good music, give as a gift at xmas."
3,NOT A REVIEW OF THE CD!,I received this 'AS NEW' CD in a lesser state. The case was fine - the CD had multiple scratches across the disc from previous play use.
3,Good for kids,"In case you don't know (but if you're looking for a Doctor Who book, how could you not??), this is the novelization of the first story featuring Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor. Like all ""regeneration"" stories, this one is a bit uneven, as the character of the new Doctor is always a work in progress. Even so, die-hard fans love the scene with the 4th Doctor appearing for the first time in his beloved 16' scarf.Like many of the early Target novels, ""Robot"" is written at the young teen level, so older fans will find the book a bit simplistic. And, sadly, this is not the very best Tom Baker story, filled as it is with a raft of carboard characters and a very embarrasing robot. I really only recommend this book for the hard core Who fan."
3,A History of Otego,The book was fine..however the orginial copy included a map of the village of Otego so I was disappoinnted that the map wasn't included with the book.
5,Maybe the greatest artistic achievement of our time.,"On 'Don't laugh, I love you' Ween sing the following line: ""Ernest Hemingway had always been there for me - but now Ernest Hemingway is dead."" It would be worth owning this CD for that line alone, but each of the 26(!) songs on this CD are filled with funny/tragic/brilliant lyrics. In a saner world, this would've been bigger than 'Thriller'."
2,Way overrated...,"First of all, this album is not the classic a lot of people here seem to claim it is. This is a cd for Ween fanatics only. If you don't like or care about Ween, you won't like this cd. It is mainly an hour of screaming, yelling, and disjointed singing over fast guitar riffs and jangly pop sounds. While some of the songs are really creative and good, most is just white noise. I really love Ween's later, poppier albums like ""Chocolate & Cheese"" and ""White Pepper"", so I thought I'd like the earlier stuff as well. But be warned...this sounds TOTALLY different from their post-C&C stuff. Personally, I'd recommend all Ween albums from ""Pure Guava"" onwards because they are all brilliant, but this one really dissapointed me."
4,Memorable Images,"I've enjoyed having my memory jogged by this book of photos of New York in the 70s, most of them of famous people and places.I especially enjoyed the images of the Lennon-Ono family (John and Yoko). I wonder what Lennon would make of New York today, with Montblanc stores in the industrial SoHo and TriBeCa districts.I didn't find it as useful for my purposes (I'm writing a memoir, and I lived in NYC in the 60s and spent time there in the 70s) as it might be, but it is a lovely book and I can definitely recommend it to anyone who admires John and Yoko or has curiosity about Club 54."
1,Please read this before buying...,"This watch is light and functional.However, the band (to watch face) attachment is not!!!It will pop off, and there is no way to re-attach it.In fact, you must send it back, which I did, and was imformedthat they can't fix it, it has to be replaced.Timex will charge you for the replacement.Seriously... don't buy this type watch.Anything you see from Timex that attaches this way is defective.They must love getting them returned so frequently.Sad design and poor Customer Service on these."
3,Display Unreadable,"Timex watches rock. They are very well engineered, take a lot of abuse, and have a lot of smart functions. Great user interface.Having said that, don't buy this watch. The display features white letters on a black background, and is almost unreadable. After it arrived on Saturday, I took it to a party. Everyone agreed. Some thought that it might be very effective in bright sunlight. Perhaps, but I'll never know, because this puppy is going back to the pound."
2,Broken watch band,I bought this watch 3 months ago. Today I noticed that the plastic band has detached from the timepiece. The band is not your normal band it is integrated into the watch through small plastic attachments. Once detached you cannot reattach. The watch is now useless. Do not buy this watch.
2,Very difficult to read the digits,"There is very little contrast between the digits and face of the watch, which makes reading the time very difficult in normal lighting. The contrast at night is only helpful when you press the button to illuminate the digits via the Indiglo function - somewhat difficult to do when running. It's too bad there isn't a setting to turn on the Indiglo for an extended period, e.g. for 60 minutes, which would allow a runner to take advantage of the lighting without having to fumble for the button in full stride."
2,INDIGLO Stopped Working within 3 months,Four black side buttons have a mushy feel to them. The night light function stopped working after less than 3 months. I like the watch in other respects but I can see the other buttons failing soon.
1,Short-lived Relief,"I had a flea infestation this year and thought I would try this fogger. I followed the instructions to the letter and even made sure I had more than enough foggers to cover the square footage in my townhouse. However, the results were less than satisfactory. Apparently, it killed the fleas but not the eggs. Within a week, I had more fleas (a lot more).Considering the amount of prep that needs to be done before fogging and the cleanup afterward, I have concluded that it isn't worth the effort."
4,Fleas fleas go away,"My son brought in a friend's dog and we quickly had a flea problem all over the house. Bought 8 of these for my house after having tried other products. At first I thought it wasn't working, but after a couple weeks with sweeping every day I have not found any fleas. I would reccomend this along with DAILY sweeping and use of sprays in areas not reached. Don't skimp. use one in each room. (Thank God I have a Rexair Rainbow vacumn system with great suctioning power and a water collection to let me see all fleas picked up.)"
2,Didn't kill the fleas in Brooklyn,"This stuff didn't work simple as that. I Followed directions closely really hoping for results, but the fleas kept marching on. The life cycle of the flea is kinda tricky to be fair. Their laid eggs are protected in a water proof cocoon, and the gestation period varies. Adults can go for a couple of months without a meal. Flea pupae can stay in their cocoons for up to a year, waiting to sense the body heat and vibrations that signal the presence of nearby hosts. Fleas are a mean joke nature plays on furry animals mostly but you too can be an insects dinner."
3,NOT AS EFFECTIVE AS PROFESSIONAL GRADE BUT BETTER THAN NOTHING,"DIDN'T QUITE DO THE JOB - HELPED, BUT DIDN'T ELIMINATE TICKS UNTIL I HAD THE GUEST HOUSE PROFESSIONALLY SPRAYED. I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THIS STUFF."
3,works fairly well...,"It works in that it fogs, but I found alive bed bugs, just moving more slowly, after using this product. Ended up hiring a professional to spray my bed/area but the pro guy said based on the small size of my place he couldn't spray everywhere and the bugs could be anywhere so I credit this fogger for 1/4 of the job. The key is then to wash everything you own, use a mattress pad and don't take the mattress pad off for 18 months. Demetrius earth I also credit, oil containers under every furniture leg, and Capstar tablets which me and my dog both took (me by accident) to stop the biting. Also I blame a cracked open window for slight less effectiveness... If I just had fleas this product would probably be gold. I also used one other fogger and sprays and 12 months later I still found some babies hatching under my mattress so yes, wait 2 years to be safe as the suckers can go 18 mos. without a meal."
3,Flea Fogger,"Havent used it yet. Trying Diatomaceous Earth first. Sounds like it's very toxic stuff, but I will use it if needed. Last resort."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,I bought and set off 6 of these bombs and now the fleas are twice as bad as they were before I set the bombs off!!!
3,does the job,"The car seat has all the safety features; however, I find the levers to change the handle position to be very stiff. Otherwise, it seems to work just fine."
3,stiff handles,"Cute design, but the handle is very difficult to move, very stiff! Other than that works great!"
1,Airline Puff,I began to read this on the plane home recently and ended up leaving it in the seat back pouch upon deboarding.
3,Not bad,"If you are to be shipwrecked on a desolate island with a library of 1000 books, don't take this one."
1,terrible,This is the worst book I ever read. Whoever said this book was remotly good must have beeen paid to say that.
5,The Strangest Book,"This may very well be the strangest book I've ever read. (I am excluding work with photos or art.) The language Marcus uses has a very simple pattern, in the way he habitually redefines very common words to recreate their meaning within the context of the larger meaning of the book, but it works. The meaning blooms like a poisonous flower.The English language is slippery, and its ambiguity is used to great effect in poetry. But Marcus uses the language by re-envisioning the meaning of certain very common words. The word ""cult"" is invariably used when trying to nail down what this book means. Well, ""cults"" do redefine common words...just not to this extent. Plus, the book does not apply remotely to any extant cult, so that reference is not too helpful in understanding the book. ""Notable American Women"" should shake you up.Hey, Naked Lunch was wild, but this is wilder, IMO."
4,underrated album,"The rereleased, remastered Blue Earth by the Jayhawks is the seedling from which some amazing Americana grew. Originally released in 1989 by the Minneapolis label Twin/Tone, Blue Earth showcases a young band with great promise. Sure the songs are not as polished and well crafted as those on Hollywood Town Hall and later records. But there is a certain rustic charm to the cuts on this album. The listener can hear Olson and Louris search to find their voices in these simple country-styled compositions. Songs like Five Cups of Coffee and Will I Marry show the beginnings of fine craftsmanship. Enjoy this record for what it is: a small gift. There are no professional session players, no big name producer. This is a few guys from the upper midwest saving up some cash for studio time, playing together while drinking a few too many Grain Belt beers. Sounds like Blue Earth to me."
4,Great but the Jayhawks have done well without Olson,This is a great album but a tinge too country. Louris and Perlman have certain proven that they can put out an excellent recording without Olson. Louris has matured quite well as a song writer. The Jayhawks are quite a refreshing sound from the trash on the radio
3,A glimpse at the greatness to follow,"While a little more country than country rock, any fan of ""Tommorrow the Green Grass"" or ""Hollywood Town Hall"" will enjoy letting this album grow on them. The harmonies are there, they are just spattered around more sparingly. Give it time. I only wish they had more recordings to review."
4,A Good Collection,"This collection of Iraqi music is quite unique and interesting. A good combination of sung songs and instrumental pieces are offered. While many of the songs can be a little slow and mellow, they are good background music. There are however a few tracks that are quite fast and energetic. The only reason I rated this cd as 4 stars and not 5 is that I was looking for a faster paced cd. But this is still a very good collection and I have not regretted buying it."
1,CD,"I was pleased with the quick delivery of the seller, and the CD is in perfect condition. I am glad that I did not buy the album new as it not as good as I had anticipated."
1,UNCOMFORTABLE!!,WOOD HEEL IS EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE AFTER 5 MINUTES. TO NARROW AND STRAPS BURN TOP OF FOOT. NEVER WEAR THEM ONLY AROUND MY HOUSE FOR A MINUTE OR TWO.
1,Girl + Girl = Pretentious and boring,This had to be the most boring collection of crap thrown together. I watch a lot of indie and foreign films...even down to the bizarre and artsy fartsy and this just blows. None of them held my attention; I flipped to the next to see if it was at least better than the other and it was just as crappy. Do yourself a favor and rent it.
2,Not bad Just not good,"This type of film started out well and then went to an artsy forum which was not well done. Recommend for this type of film buff to see Better than Chocolate, Saving Face, or Bound and let this trash remain on the shelf."
3,"Yup, it's a power strip attached to a mounting bracket.","This is a power strip designed to mount in a structured wiring panel. The power strip supplied is pretty low grade, so you are really paying a lot for a mounting bracket here. In fact, I don't believe there is any surge protection capability, only a circuit breaker.The bracket is sturdy and uses two pins on one side and one pin on the other side. When mounted, it easily holds heavy wall warts without a problem. It is also low-profile, so you have plenty of clearance for plugs or wall warts without interfering with the enclosure door.I believe the cord is 3 foot long. I wish it were shorter actually, but what can you do."
4,Fine modern advanced undergraduate special relativity,"This material of this book was successfully used in a course of special relativity for advanced undergraduates at the University of Stockholm by the late professor Bertel Laurent, one of Oskar Klein's best students. When he sadly passed away shortly before retirement the manuscript was transformed into a book by his enthusiastic friend Stig Flodmark.The book is unusual in that it does not discuss the historical, philosophical, and experimental background that most book dwell on a lot. Instead special relativity is clearly and simply presented with modern coordinate free (index free) notation as a correct and accepted theory of physics. I recommend it strongly as a concise, pedagogical, and compact course book with a modern point of view."
5,Electronic Flasher for Honda Rebel,Bought this flasher to replace the stock flasher on my honda rebel. Using an electronic flasher enables you to run LED turn signals without needing resistor packs(that can cause issues). Removed the stock flasher module and installed this one to the same location using the stock rubber mount. It works great. I have been running this flasher for a year without any trouble.
4,Caldcott Medal Winner,The book Mirette on the high wire is a good children's book because the pictures and words are very descriptive. This story is about a retired high wire artist who lives in a boarding house and a little girl who has dreams of being a high wire artist. So the high wire artist teaches her how to walk the wire and her dreams of being a high wire artist come true.
5,The High Wire of Courage,"Mirette on the High Wire is a great picture book with amazing pictures on every page. This book is about obtaining the courage to complete any dream a person wants to achieve. Mirette on the High Wire is about a girl who works at her mother's boardinghouse in Paris. One day a man comes to the boardinghouse looking for a room to stay in. When Mirette is working the next day she notices he is walking on a wire. Soon she tries to walk on the wire but falls off. With a lot of practice she is ready to learn the ways of the man who walks on the high wire. He teaches her what he knows and then later on she finds out he is the famous Bellini who walks on high wires. Mirette learns of his secret, which I will not spoil.Mirette on a High Wire is a great book for a child to read. It teaches the reader to have courage and to never give up on your dreams. Sometimes all it takes is just a little push from someone else. This book is a Caldecott Award winner and one of my favorites."
3,To walk a line,"This is a beautiful story with very beautiful and extravagant pictures. I'd recommend this book to most new readers, even young ones. The plot is great. It's the old man meets the little girl helps her, but the girl also helps him through his hard and troubled times."
2,Mirette on the High Wire,This book is about how a young girls caretaker owns a hotel and a famous tightroper comes there to stay for a while. The young girl asked him if he could teach her how to walk on a tight rope. After months of pratice she learned how to walk on the tightrope with her teacher. One day Mirette's town was having a celebration and Mirette and her teacher showed the town what they could do. I kind of like this book because it taught me how to never give up on what you're learning.
2,One of the Biggest Wastes of Paper Ever!,"I gave Mirette On The High Wire only 2 stars because it was very predictable. The only fair part of the book was the pictures. They might have been an alright nomination, but definitely should not have won. It was predictable when Belini said no to Mirette to teach her to walk on the wire. I believe it was a very bad book!"
1,"Not only unhelpful, but misleading","I am throwing in my hat with the other reviewers: this book is not worth your money. The unit information is consistently incorrect, while the strategy segment borders on vapid. While I did pick up a nugget of wisdom or two (for example, that you can transfer followers between generals), I've learned far more from the internet forums. The game is great, but this manual is not."
2,"If three makes a consensus, then it's official...","I've been gaming and purchasing gaming manuals since the mid-to-early 90's. Most are very detailed and valuable and serve as true ""strategy guides."" This guide is very thin on strategy and full on filler. The unit information can actually be gleaned in game. This book is a bit redundant and as the other reviews have hinted, it can be passed over in favor of the internet and/or your own learning curve."
2,Not worth the price,"This guide has a few useful hints of play, but not as many as one would expect for such a work. Most of the book is devoted to a unit list, but even that contains many errors and is of limited use because it is not tabulated for easy comparison. Some other lists are interesting, like the character trait list or the building list, but they are also similarly shallow. No in-depth analysis of the game workings is given, which would have been very useful.I use it occasionally during play for the few tidbits it contains, but I do not recommend it at the price given."
3,strategy guide or general review of the game ?,"the strategy guide of medieval 2 total war is one I wouldn't strongly recommand if you are really searching for in depth strategy outlines. It is more a general review of the game, a big manual to say. Altough the content is quite intersting giving some interesting tips and a thourough overview of unit parameters. I expected to have a larger focus on the in game strategy, even suggesting some interesting formations and battle tactics. Certainly because the game is one of the best strategy games ever made. Regretfully the authours of the guide didn't include outlined battle tactis. More a general description of how to conduct siege and open field battles.So in conclusion a very good review of the game, but not realy a strategy guide"
1,Xeroxed Data,"I found the guide from Totalwarboard much more insightful; it includes tactics and strategy articles, 3D models for individual units and breakdowns for each settlement. The basis of certain articles comes fromTHE FACE OF BATTLEby John Keegan.That this weak guide is labeled ""Official"" shows how small minded Creative Assembly has been on the subject of a strategy companion."
5,AWESOME - EMOTIONAL - REVEALING - INFORMATIONAL - THE BEST,"This book of letters is so revealing of that period in time.It lays the emotions of the women left behind during war time right out in the open for all to feel and experience. This book has become a part of my life. I work at a college and when we have a program that needs a reading done I am always called on to read from ""my"" book of WWII letters from home. I feel like these letters are my children and each one is crying out to be heard and I really do hate to have to pick only a couple to read. This book is that good. I feel that this book should be read by everybody especially young people. I get very good response after my readings and some very emotional responses as well. This is a truly wonderful book and I recommend it to everyone."
3,"Transitional, yet Enjoyable (3.5 stars)","""Hootenanny"" can't touch the 'Mats best work, but it's always a fun listen. Three of the songs here (""Willpower,"" ""Color Me Impressed,"" and the gorgeous ""Within Your Reach"") hint at greater things to come on their next album. The remainder of ""Hootenanny"" ranges from enjoyable punk (""Take Me to the Hospital"" and ""Run It"") to listenable filler. It's this eclecticism that prevents ""Hootenanny"" from matching the sheer joy of ""Sorry Ma.."" or the indie pop of the 'Mats later albums. Nevertheless, ""Hootenanny"" belongs in the collection of every true Replacements fan."
5,"Beautiful, ballsy brilliance","I'm prejudiced since The Mats are my all-time favorite band, but this album is so damn easy to love. If you're looking for ballsy rockers with brains, it's hard to beat tunes like ""Color Me Impressed"" and, for heartwrenching vulnerability, no song I've ever heard matches ""Within Your Reach"". This isn't my favorite Mats album but it's still one of my favorite albums, period. Like I said, I'm hardly an objective critic."
4,Hootenany in Heat?,"This was the first Replacements record I ever heard and for years I thought it started with ""Hootenany in heat."" Just recently I discovered it started with ""Hootenany in G."" Doesn't matter to me. Heat describes this record better. Goofball cowpunk, thrashing guitars, rock and roll antics, and a reading of the personals section. What more could we ask for?"
2,Disappointed - very basic,"I was very disappointed in this book. The ideas were extremely basic. You often needed existing dog embellishments and items. The instructions were not detailed. ie. Get an plain picture frame, paint it, glue on dog buttons (that you had bought). Very little imagination or original ideas. The drawings to be used as templates were poor quality. Gave the book away after looking at it for less than 1/2 hour."
2,Dog Stuff,"I thought this would be a neat book to have so that I can give gifts to all my family & friends who have dogs. Well, the crafts in this book are somewhat child like and not at all what I would give as a gift. So, I gave the book to my friends daughter."
5,This book should not be listed under children's literature,"Once in a while a book comes along from out of nowhere and becomes your best friend. Anything BUT a child's book! If you are a New Age thinker, you will not only love this book, you will never lend it out for fear of being without it."
5,"Great faucet, fast shipping","We needed a bisque-colored faucet quickly, as we were remodeling and our local do-it-yourslf stores stopped carrying this color. The faucet arrived faster than promised, and we love the way it works. Even the plumber installing it commented on how nice it was."
1,"Terrible, hack writing - a book best left unread.","This type of writing is usually reserved for romance novels. Cheaply written with a minimum of thought (both in style and plot), simply churned for easy sales - cashing in on the popularity of the television show without adding anything truly fresh or unique. A pathetic attempt not worthy of anyone's attention."
1,"Plodding, dull, flat, and anachronistic","The character, ""Methos"", of the ""Highlander"" TV series is incredibly rich, vibrant, colorful, and indescribably exciting. Ms. Sherman has managed to make him a cardboard figure buried in Egypt thru the majority of this wearying hack piece and even managed to make the MacLeod-Methos relationship gray and lifeless. Worst of all, the author makes a novice's basic error in having ""ancient Methos"" speaking and thinking in late 20th Century idiom. I devour good books in hours. It took me 4 nights to valiantly persevere through this one."
4,"Finally, a Methos book! But, more action please","Finally, a Methos book! As a fan of the ROG, I was thrilled to find a book that was mostly about Methos. However, I was rather dismayed... The characterizations, especially Methos and MacLeod, were very flat--more like stock heroes rather than the two unique ones we've come to enjoy. While it was very, very cool to see Methos taking center stage (where he belongs!) I, like several other reviewers here, was rather dismayed to see his special personality, a hard shell of ""look out for number one"" concealing a care and respect for other people. The way he was portrayed, he could have been a hero from any number of fantasy/sci-fi books out there.That said, it's a neat adventure, and as a history fan, I enjoyed reading about the Egyptian/Hyksos conflict. If nothing else, Ms. Sherman really did her homework!"
3,Brain Candy,"It is what it is: a novel based on a tv series. Don't expect Shakespeare and you'll probably enjoy it. Sherman tends to like to use the same phrases over and over again, which can be a bit annoying, and there are some problems with the way she presents the characters. But for Methos fans desperate for any new stories abut him, it may just tide you over for a while. Definitely brain candy."
3,Liked it but...,"First of all I`ve got to say I liked the book. Maybe just because it was a book about Methos but I liked it. But there are two things I found very strange about Ms. Sherman`s Methos. First: This is 1573 b.c., isn`t it? So why am I feeling as if Methos is behaving like a 20th Century man? Second: It`s just fantastic how fast Methos was capable to change his whole self. In some parts of the world the Bronze Age went on from 2500 to 900 b.c. . So, Methos was ""Death"" for thousand years during that Age, then radically changed his mind and became the perfectly good saver of Egypt in 1573 b.c. ? It was a good story with a wonderful historical background. But for me, this historical background just not fits Methos` historical background. That`s why I believe the story doesn`t work as perfectly as it should do."
2,I Wanted to Love This Book,"I really, really did. But I just couldn't, despite the fact that Methos is my favorite character from the Highlander series.In this book, a madman is killing people in New York City by beheading and disemboweling them. As it turns out, Methos knew this immortal, a Hyksos Prince, in 1500 BC. In flashbacks, we see Methos in Egypt and the Hyksos territory thousands of years ago and how he came to meet and do battle with this insane immortal. Eventually, McLeod and Methos set up a trap to catch this evil immortal on top of a Manhattan museum in the middle of a rainstorm.I was hoping for more insight into what makes Methos tick, but this book did not deliver. The other characters were flat stereotypes, and the plot predictable. A Quickening on top of a building in the middle of a thunderstorm - gee, I haven't seen that one before."
2,MONO sound,"The performance is very good, but the sound is bad. Apparently, they used only one microphone to record to opera, with near mono sound (or may be it is in mono) and lots of noises, the orchestra was far from the microphone and the sound was not balanced."
5,Fits my wife's very small Rado wrist watch.,"As stated above this replacement watch band fits my wife's Rado wrist watch. It's attractive and closely resembles the original equipment, a Rado Coupole Leather Ladies Watch."
3,"A good Transformers-style RPG, but NOT a self-contained RPG.","The book's probably the closest thing we'll ever get to a Transformers role-playing game, but it unfortunately requires the D&D; rulebooks to play the game. This is kind of disappointing since the back of the book claims that it's a ""complete, self-contained"" RPG. Requiring additional rulebooks is hardly complete or self-contained. It's great as a campaign setting, but it's not a stand-alone game. There are also some unfortunate editing errors, in the layout, grammar, and rules presented in the book.That being said, it's a pretty good book for only $15 and it includes rules to play just about any kind of Transformer ranging from a G1 character to Headmasters and even to Beast Wars. If you've ever had any interest playing a Transformers RPG and are familiar with the d20 system, this book is entirely worth picking up."
5,a wonderful book,"This book is touching, how he talks about love and how we all need and want love, and the many ways we can love and do and don't live in love - and it is simple and uncomplicated, very wonderful to read."
3,Maybe my expectations were too high,"This is the only toy I regret buying for my boys. Though I wouldn't hesitate to buy another car transporter (car carrier) I would not again pay fifty dollars. I was on a ""no plastic"" kick when I bought it. I thought it would last a lifetime and that made the price worth it.When it arrived it met my expectations, though I noticed one tiny knob used to hinge the upper carriage was not cast properly or had been broken a bit and paint was missing. Unfortunately, that made it easy for the upper carriage to come apart from the rest of the transporter. It is now in pieces while another car transporter (unfortunately made in China and made of plastic) is still being played with.If you are curious I looked at the other transporter and it has no name- only ""Made in China"". It was given to us from some friends as a toy they grew out of. It has a red metal cab, but the entire carriage is gray plastic. It is also slightly larger than this Siku."
1,Not Even Close,"When my shipment from Christmas Lights Etc. came in the grape lights looked nothing like what was on the web sight!! They were very dark, almost black and when you light them, they look like they have a red glow not purple. I sent them a pictures of the lights that I received and they said that the lights looked nothing like the ones in their showroom and gave me credit. They checked all of the boxes that they had and all of the boxes were the dark ones. They told me that the manufacturer must have changed the new lights! I think I would change the picture on the web sight before selling the new lights. What a shame!!!!!!"
2,"WORMS, HAHA","Ok, let me lay it out for you. I just barely played this game out of sheer boredom, and i think the last time i played it was like 2 years ago. This game basically SUX! You have fun, figuring out everything and all, but after a while, it is just plain boring. Save yourself some time and buy an electric guitar, a snowboard, get Sum 41's cd Chuck, and dream the day away......"
3,Warning this is not the original album,"This album is simply Amazon burning Park Hyo Shin's song onto a CD. The quality is still CDA; however, for the price of $15.99 you could buy the original album in the original casing on ebay.This album contains none of the original pictures, is packaged in a standard case, BUT comes with CDA quality sound."
1,guess who gets the award for most annoying song of the year?,"don't get me wrong, i LOVE s club. the REAL s club, not some s club wannabes. i honestly believe the only reason anyone buys s club junior singles is because it has 's club' in it. these kids are 10-14 years old. 10 years old???? how about waiting till these kids reach puberty before giving them a record deal. as for the song, this is one of THE most annoying songs ive ever heard (along with steps ""5,6,7,8"" crap). save your money for a single from the real deal: S CLUB"
3,"Good, solid, old-fashioned SF","Short stories of science fiction. This book includes- ""Earthman, Beware."" A man realizes that he's not human and tries to call his people from the stars.- ""Quixote and the Windmill."" The problem of leisure: what if machines do all the work?- ""Gypsy."" A nice story about those who don't want to settle down, with a fairly subtle twist at the end.- ""For the Duration."" A hero fights against dictatorship.- ""Duel on Syrtis."" Martians were a protected species, but a rich man wanted one for a trophy.- ""The Star Beast."" A man wants to be a tiger--and in the far future, it's possible. (This story has no relation to Robert Heinlein's book of the same name.) It reminds me, rather, of Andre Norton.- ""The Disintegrating Sky."" One of those ironic stories.- ""Among Thieves."" Interstellar warfare--well done."
4,Under rated,"This album is one of the best records out today, and for some reason no one has really heard of it. It's sad. I would suggest to any one to listen to the Dave Fischoff"
2,Blues Again,"Good music, great performer, lousy production on the CD. Lonnie needs to find another recording studio, maybe one not in a basement or a garage."
4,Gotta Have It!,"I heard a song off this record on the radio and had to buy it. Great ""Texas Blues"" and well put together material."
4,Ronnie Baker Brooks - Great Debut Album,"Ronnie is the son of Chicago blues legend Lonnie Brooks and ""Golddigger"" was his debut album. If you like fiery blues guitar with more than a hint of Hendrix this album should appeal to you. Brooks' father and Chicago mainstay Jellybean Johnson both make guest appearances here as well. Brooks mixes traditional blues with a little funk, some soul and a good dose of rock to make a modern blues album in the Chicago tradition. Brooks is a fantastic guitarist and a solid vocalist and with songs like ""She's A Golddigger"" and ""Stuck On Stupid"" it is clear that his songwriting chops are top notch as well. For a debut disc, this one is very good and should appeal to anyone who enjoys modern guitar based blues."
5,Page turner!,"I love a good book, and this one is one of the best I ever read! Not just your standard murder mystery, it has everything: romance (a little kinky sex), pathos, tragedy, child abuse, treachery, moral arguments by the protagonists, all woven into a tight and fast-past story that will touch your heart. Read it!"
5,Much more than a murder mystery,"While this book is a great murder mystery that will keep you in suspense until the very end, it offers much more to the reader. The story contains a great deal of social criticism on issues such as declining academic standards, stereotyping and intolerance. In addition, the author was able to develop the main characters very thoroughly and convincingly. By the end of the book, I felt as if I knew the characters personally and wanted to read more about them."
3,Explicit crimes of a perderast,"The book gives loads of details going on and on about how Tony seduced boys, and how he and other ministry men sexually abused the boys. Sad how parents defended Tony because they were told not to touch the anointed of God. When a mother comes forward her character is questioned. On and on with loads of sexual abuse details, it can be a little much. After a while I just wanted the book to end."
5,Relaxing Read-Aloud,"This is a staple in our fall repertoire, but is also a favorite all year long. My daughter has been asking for this at story time for two years now and neither of us ever grow tired of it. It's a great book to form ""mental movies"" with--the text invokes all the senses as you read the smells, sights & sounds of autumn. Reading this book always makes us want to go make an apple pie to finish it off. I highly recommend this book. Buy it, curl up with your kids, and breathe in the wonders of apple picking time."
5,A Real Page Turner,"This novel is one of Spark's best. I first read it as a teenager and couldn't put it down. It takes place amidst the political turmoil of the Middle East in the early 1960s and the trial of Adolph Eichmann in Jerusalem. It is filled with intrigue and with almost too many things happening as Barbara Vaughan, an English spinster of partly Jewish heritage, travels to the Holy Land to be with her boyfriend, an archaeologist working in Jordan on the Dead Sea Scrolls. Crossing from Israel to Jordan she is mistaken for a spy and must go undercover as a muslim woman covered from head to toe. Check out the original review by Malcolm Bradbury in the New Yorker for more details."
2,Readable but hard to follow and scarcely worth the effort,"I picked this book up when I ran out of reading material over the holidays. It looked great from the book cover (but you know what they say . . .) I found it to be a tedious book, very long and somewhat dull. Worst of all, when the ""weird part"" takes over -- it is very hard to follow. Impossible to understand what actually befell the primary male character. I can't recommend it unless you get it for free and have lots of time on your hands."
2,Great music for amenian dance only,"This cd is great if you are just a listener, as a dancer it limits you too 2/4.....6/8 and 9/8 rythems.no 4/4.....nothing to put together for a routene etc.Not usable for a dancer in the arabic or egytion styles..armenian folk dancers will love it, but it is not for the serious belly dancer."
2,not for the arabic dancer,"This cd is great if you want to line dance,or like low key love songs.There are no 4/4 ..balady rythems for the well rounded dancer.There isnt a drum solo....we find it not usable for a belly dance routene.The kanoon work is superb.Great if you like Armenian music only."
5,Best new middle eastern cd I've heard,I bought this CD at Rakkasah in March. I listened to it on my long drive home and loved it. I rarely take this CD out of my car CD player except to take into the house or work and listen to it there. All the songs are beautifully performed both musically and vocally. I recommend this CD to everyone and have even bought one for my daughter's friend who just started belly dancing and she also loves it. If your looking for dance music or just wonderful music to listen to buy this CD you won't be disappointed.
3,just ok,"I had to hack this card in order to get it to fit inside of an mac ibook. The card that fits in the ibook costs like 100 dollars. Give me a break. Unfortunately these cards just don't seem to have much range. The card that comes with the mac is just as bad. I also have a macbook and it uses a different card and it works perfectly, no beach balls looking for servers etc..I would only use this card if you have and old system that can't take the new technology. But if you can, make the upgrade."
4,Plug and play,"Needed to get my wife's laptop set for wireless and the Aria Extreme was the perfect solution. Inexpensive and easy to start using, even for those not terribly computer savvy, like me!"
1,Does not work with Powerbook Wallstreet G3,"Despite the specifications listed by Amazon, this card will not work with Mac Powerbook G3 before lombar and pismo and computers running less than Panther Mac OSX 10.3. This includes much of the Powerbook G3 line. I contacted Sonnet and they confirmed that the Amazon information is incorrect. I have used other Sonnet products with good results and I think that this is a misunderstanding on Amazon's part. The Sonnet tech people said that they would contact Amazon to correct this issue."
4,Good in small doses,"I enjoy most of these songs. I don't enjoy listening to the CD straight through. The songs sound so similar. I listen to a lot of music that is repetitive in nature: ambient, techno, house, etc. I'm okay with repetition in the same song as that can lead to interesting progressions. However, this CD has repetitive elements across songs to the point where I don't like to listen to the whole thing at once. There are great songs on here especially the last one. This is not a CD I could throw into my CD player and forget about."
