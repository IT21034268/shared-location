2,"Where's ""In Your Eyes"" ??????","Being a Gabriel's fan for a long time, I agree that much of his early work is forgotten in this compilation. But Peter Gabriels's greatest song, a remarkable moment in his career, that highlighted an important scene of a great moive, Cameron Crowe's ""Say Anything"", the amazing ""In You Eyes"" is, again ""left behind"" in this collection. In his first compilation, ""Shaking the Tree"". the song was completely forgotten. Now they do it again. If you listen to any live Gabriel CD or watch any of his marvelous 2 DVD shows, ""In Your Eyes"" is the last song played, the climax for the presentation. There's absolutely no excuse and I consider an offense to a fan who wants a remastered compilation or to someone who wants to know Peter's work better the absence of this song in the compilation and take 3 stars of my revie just for this reason."
2,Please - No More Radio Edits,"I was thinking about picking this one up - until I read it is another record company rip-off.Like Forty Licks, the label issues radio edit versions of some songs.I would rather see these companies include one or two less songs on these compilations, so fans can get the full length tracks.Here is a great artist who doesn't need edited versions on packages like this one.Watch the record companies wait 2 or 3 years and then come out with 'New & Improved' Greatest Hits collections with unedited songs from your favorite artists."
4,Fine set yet missing some songs,This is a good place for any Peter Gabriel fan to start with if your looking for one set to complete your collection. A few of my favorite songs of his were not included here. A few reviewers also said the same thing. Think anytime now a 4 disc best of set should come out. Otherwise this is not a bad piece of music for the average fan.Peter J. Miller
4,Nice CD,"This came in new condition and I have enjoyed all of the music on the 2 CD's. I do not agree with all of the writers ""hits"" and ""misses"" but it is an eclectic collection."
5,A fine introduction to Mr. Gabriel's work,"While this collection is a major improvement over Shaking the Tree, it is not without its problems. There are no inclusions from Peter Gabriel 2 and Passion, and OVO is over-represented. Having said that, this 2-disc set summarizes Peter Gabriel's work very nicely. The new or casual fan should purchase this album first, while those of us who already own most of his recordings will want it primarily for the excellent new track, ""Burn You Up, Burn You Down""."
4,"Great for average music fans,bit too less for advanced fans","for everyone who want to know Pg music and for everyone who want to have only 1 Peter Gabriel album ""Hit"" is a great choice.featuring many important songs,few new ones (""Downside up"",""Growing up"",unreleased ""Lovetown"" it igves a portrait of an amazing artist who creates such a rich,powerfull and gentle in the same time and also catchy music.the only thing that i complain is that ""In your eyes"" (from ""so"") is missing here and also some songs from very good although underrated second album ""Scratch"" (Where is ""DIY"",""On the air"" or ""Mother of voilence""? these are fantastic songs!)but anyway - it's very good (but maybe not definitive as it says on cover),it fits perfectly the gap between compitations like ""Shaking the tree - 16 golden greats"" (1978 - 1990) and ""Growing up live tour dvd "" (many tracks from 1992 - 2003) with nice addition of few new tracks.i am sure it will be a worldwide Hit!"
5,Thank you!,My order came fast and in excellent condition (just as posted). Thank you so much for the awesome book!
5,Great Treasury of Recipes - Vincent & Mary Price,Thank you so much to Barnett Books! I got my recipe book very fast and just as it was described. I even had a question and Mr. Barnett got back with me VERY quickly. I will definitely use them in the future for all my book purchases as he is at least a couple of dollars cheaper than most other vendors and has a great variety especially of cookbooks! Thanks again for your GREAT service!
3,Listen to the samples!,"This is where I made my mistake. Based on the 1st review, I got this CD. Had I listened to the samples, I would have passed. This is just not my style. The group is top-notch. But I wanted to hear some great Bari playing. There is not a lot of it, since Hamiet features all these musicians fairly equally. When Hamiet does play, its like someone is swearing at me through the Bari sax. Its too advant garde for my tastes."
1,SKIP THIS ONE! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED,This dvd is only about 15 minutes on behind the scenes of Lawrence of Arabia. The bulk of this dvd is biographies of Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif including all the films each did and summaries of THOSE films. Ends with film clips of director David Lean and summaries of THOSE films. Very disappointing as I bought it for Lawrence ONLY. You have been warned.
1,Very Poor Book!,This book is poorly written and organized. While a few chapters and topics are treated well enough most of the content is jumbled and confused and one wonders if the authors in some places actually understand their topics. There are too many good books such as the ORielly books or the Sams book on Web Services to even bother with this book. Skip it and spend your more money on another book.
2,"Mixed examples, and inaccuracy","This is the first of what promises to be a slew of new books coming out on Web Services. As the first book out I guess it's what you'd expect from a book rushed to press. The examples are frequently flawed. If you're already familiar with most of the technology, or you're willing to read the documentation of the WSTK and various Apache documents along with this book you'll find this book a good primer. However, if you're new don't go for this book. The examples tend to be a mixed jumble flowing from COM, Java, NET and even Perl occasionally with in the same example. If you're planning on using all those technologies (and have them all set up) you might be ok. However, if you just want to build a Java webservice, well this isn't the book for you."
4,Good Solutions,"This book could be a bit technical for those with out a small physics and calculus background, but it does describe many of the difficulties that would need to be over come and lays out a plan as how to do it. It successfully answered many of the problems I had thought up when thinking of the space elevator and explained in detail how to overcome them."
1,Bummed,"Warning! This item does not come with rotating leveling base as shown in the photos. As pictured it would have been perfect for my project...as is, it is useless. Back it goes!"
1,The movie is great. But the DVD transfer is trash!,"Don't buy it! The DVD transfer is like trash, although the movie is fantastic. Shame on the DVD producers... That's strange because they had made a really good job with the transfer of the second DVD: Lone Wolf and Cub 2: Baby Cart at the River Styx , which I highly recommend, both in technical and artistic terms."
3,"It's a good ""spaghetti"" samuri film, but ...","5 stars! No *way*. That can only be reserved for Kurosawa's ""The Seven Samuri,"" the penultimate samuri movie. Or ""The Hidden Fortress"", ""Yojimbo"", etc.Now having said that, these are enjoyable, well-directed films, good for an evening of light escapism. Personally though, I find it hard to reconcile the occasional moments of cinematic excellence with the very liberal usage of whatever special effects technology shoots fake blood out 10 to 15 feet from a sword wound. And I could have done without the gratuitous breast shots and rape scenes too. Zatochi, in his travels, didn't run into such incidents ... what is it about the Lone Wolf that attracts such goings on?"
4,"Fun movie, faithful to the manga","What a great, great movie. I've been getting back into samurai flicks after a long hiatus. I wanted to see this after having seen Kill Bill v.1 -- you can see the influence after watching Lone Wolf and Cub -- and boy, this movie and its vol. 2 sequel (baby cart on river styx) -- great!Clean picture, clean sounds. This is an awesome DVD. I also read the manga before the DVD and can say: it is very faithful to the manga, doing a wonderful job of bringing the Kojima's artwork to the screen. Readers of Dark Horse's manga series, vol. 1 will recognize the care taken to adapt the manga.I showed this film to a bunch of friends and they hooted and hollered. Great fun."
5,Go Ninja,"If you only have one Babycart movie this is the one because it tells you howhe got into this line of business of protection for 500 gold pieces and also the way his cub chose the right things to go with him. I like the cub's reaction to things with sort of a flattened affect, but he is so efficient in utilizing the tools on the cart and Ogami Ito is superb, not handsome, but a certainly charismatic"
1,Leaden Soldiers,"A shortened version of this film, released many years ago, was apparently condemned as a video nasty. The special effects are so laughable that it doesn't even deserve that accolade. The story is so patchy and pointless, and the acting so wooden that, unless you like watching marionettes playing with swords and squirting fake blood, give this one a miss."
1,Subtitles different than the VHS,"The subtitles for the DVDs part with all established format for subtitles. The subtitles are placed higher on the screen, in the actual film image (!). On the tapes the subtitles are as they should be, in the black lower portion of the widescreen matte. Also, the subtitles' typeface has black borders, therefore increasing the amount of image intruded upon, and making the subtitles an irritating distraction. For some reason this company has completely trashed their excellent product. The graphic design of the DVD packaging makes the films look like B-movie rubbish."
4,Aspect Ratio Confusion,"I think this may be an explanation for the aspect ratio problem. I am using a standard television, and my DVD player is configured properly. However, there is some bug in the disc that seems to interact with certain DVD players. On my player, after the menu kicks in, the initial video setup setting is changed automatically on the player from ""letterbox"" to ""pan and scan."" This leads the film to be shown at about a 1.85:1 ratio. To get it to play at the correct aspect ratio, I need to stop the disc at the Toho logo, get into the initial setup menu, change the video setting back to ""letterbox,"" and hit ""play."" If, during the film, I ever go back to the menu, it will kick back to ""pan and scan.""I don't think this is the case for all players, though. So those of you who have problems with only getting the film in 1.85:1,try my solution."
4,Note to Robert Woodhead and interested customers,While undeniably an excellent transfer was made of this film however the whole film is not on this DVD. The packaging proudly proclaims it is a 2.35:1 ratio presentation but it's only 1.85:1. If you compare the VHS edition of the same film the difference is plain to see. I can only hope that future releases by Animeigo will be properly transfered. We've been waiting years for these DVDs and I'm sorry to say I'm disappointed.
4,Excellent quality - but not Shogun Assassin,"This must be one of the best quality DVD transfers I've ever seen for an ""old school"" martial arts movie. The picture is crisp and excellent.""Sword of Vengeance"" is part one of the ""Shogun Assassin"" version of the Lone Wolf and Cub movie that was released back in the 1980's and may be the version that most of us are familiar with. Shogun Assassin was dubbed in English, was faster paced, had a nice, energetic soundtrack and was frankly more entertaining. Sword of Vengeance is of course the Japanese original and is a great movie by itself. However, for those of you out there who are hoping to have ""Shogun Assassin"" on DVD will be disappointed. Sword of Vengeance is much slower paced and I found myself skipping ahead to the fighting scenes. Still a classic and a must have for any martial arts library."
1,Tracy Anderson is a bore,"I guess the exercises Tracy Anderson does in this video are OK, but she looks about as interested in her at-home audience as a topless dancer looks when giving a lap dance to an 80 year old....TA looks like she couldn't care less.The video is BORING! But if you can get past that, I guess it's OK. I will not be ordering any more of her videos."
4,Review,"This video is doable. I am a regular exerciser. However, I found tracy's Sequence III video difficult. Also, I was getting stale with the mat video. So, I decided to get the Sequence II. It's good, loads of lower body rotations. They are challenging. Ab work is challenging too. But not much arms' rotations.I have other dvd's, from other publishers, and one can choose the individual sections, as they are divided in chapters. Tracy or her technical team, don't not do that. So, its an inconvenience. But oh well, what are we if we don't find a few faults in others.I like it. Haven't mastered it yet, but that's good news!"
3,Great lower body workout,"I felt this was a great lower body workout, but I struggled with the abs section the first few times around and the arms section is impossibly hard to follow; so I normally just stick to the lower body part of this workout. Doing only the lower portion takes about 30 minutes, Tracey seems to do equal reps on each leg and she gives decent cues. The abs section she is not as even with and not as good with explaining and cuing. The arms section doesn't use weights, I know it would be difficult for her to cue this but it's not easy to follow at all, the camera changes angles and I'm pretty sure even does slow motion for a moment. The arms segment on her mat workout DVD are much easier to follow, I thought the arms on this DVD would be similar but I was wrong. Overall it's a great butt/thigh workout, but for the price paid compared to the cost of other workout DVDs I gave it 3 stars."
4,Experiments with Bluegrass,"Nickel Creek is by far one of my favorite bands. Chris Thile is actually the reason I picked up playing the mandolin. This album, however, struck me as very out there and not very enjoyable the first time I heard it. The implimentation of the drum set (while not a bad thing in rock and/or other music genres) and other effects and instruments seemed a little much. So after I wasn't satisfied by the first listen, I listened again, and again, and again. I found that time after time, the CD started to grow on me a little more. By the 5th or so listen, I loved the CD. While the new inovations are cool, I still miss the older style of Nickel Creek and wished they would have done more traditional stuff on the CD.If you are looking for a more traditional style of bluegrass, try the self-entitled album or ""This Side"" by Nickel Creek. But, if you're looking for something that dosn't necisarrily fit any one genre, pick up this album."
2,Just can't like it,"I love the first couple Nickel Creek records, but songs like ""Helena"" where Thile brags guys like him never will be alone and other bits of dark, moody lyrics combine with ego just ruin this record. I am not overly found of Thile's odd chords and changes, but with different lyrics they could have at least not been so annoying. I've had this record for a few years and my love for the first two keep me trying it, but I have officially given up. I just can't like it. However Sara's ""Anthony"" is a keeper.Want some more music as good Nickel Creek's first two albums? Check out Sean and Sara's solo records. Thile's latest work with the Punch Brothers is even worse than this."
4,Very pleasing (but more Sara please),"Nickel Creek have been somewhat typecast as a gentle bluegrass-pop combo, and it's true that their music is pleasant to hear. But I do admire the way they continue to stretch their musical boundaries, both lyrically and melodically. Listen to a tune such as ""Eveline"" on the new CD and you will hear acoustic instruments and soft vocals, but there are also complex harmonies and tricky chord changes. As others have noted, N.C. continues to evolve in interesting ways.On the distribution of lead vocals, I do like Chris Thile's great singing - ""When You Come Back Down"" is one of my very favorite songs - but on this latest disc, I'm really wishing they would give Sara a chance to sing more. Chris sings seven songs this time, Sara three, and Sean one. I'm a Creek fan, although I've stopped short of buying Chris or Sean's solo albums. Sara is the one band member whose solo CD I would definitely buy -- but she has never done one."
5,Fine Music from Great Musicians!,"I've come to expect some good stuff from NC, and this album is no exception. Some great acoustic playing, some rock influences, and just overall talent and quality. Song highlights include: When In Rome, Doubting Thomas, Scotch and Chocolate, and Best Of Luck. Chris, Sean, and Sara are up to their usual stuff with killer instrument playing. Plus, some fine poetic lyrics are added to the mixIf you liked ""This Side"", then Why Should The Fire Die is for you! It is a departure from their last album, bu they simply are adding to their talent by just creating good music. They are not held by any boundaries, but they are free to experiment, and we get the pleasure of listening to their work!""If you're not obsessing about something, you're not into it enough!"" ~Chris Thile, Mandolin player, Nickel Creek."
2,Not what I expected at all.,"I love the Self Titled cd, so I ordered ""This Side"" and ""Why Should the Fire Die"". This last album is not at all like their others. The main dissapointment was the lyrics. Or lack thereof. I love the poetry of messages of their other songs. This album's songs seem to touch a lot on love, cheating, leaving etc. What happened to the morally upright, good messages they have portrayed in the past?I am going to be selling this cd, can't see myself listening to it."
3,Not the Same,"After hearing Nickel Creek's earlier two albums I loved them. Although, after this cd, because it has a different producer, I do not like it. Its not the same and the mixing of the voices with the music is not the classic Nickel Creek I liked. Although it is a good listen I give it a 3 just because it is too different to be called Nickel Creek."
5,great songs from great musicians,"This is one of my favorites by Nickel Creek to date. Thile has really started to let his voice go. He has a voice that really conveys emotion and I appreciate that in this album. Doubting Thomas is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. I give it all thumbs up. Check out ""eveline"" for some sweet harmonies. Somebody more like you is also fantastic."
2,A bit disappointing for Nickel Creek,"Maybe I'm alone in my opinion of this CD, but I thought it was totally mediocre. I love Nickel Creek, and have been a fan since the very beginning. I've seen them live (and loved them), own all their CDs as well as Chris Thiele's solo CD. My daughter, a professional musician with a Masters in music, likes this CD a lot, but it just kind of leaves me cold. To me, it lacks the dynamism and virtuosity that made Nickel Creek so interesting to listen to. Hey, you can't hit a home run everytime!"
2,Some good moments in between snoozes,"I think there are fine elements at times on this one, but too much drags. And yes, I'd like more Sarah vocals-- guess we'll have to await her upcoming one. I don't mindsoft textures really, but I think they're treading water, spinning their wheels-- whatever metaphor works to describe it. If they want to explore that, should be listening more to The Tin Hat Trio or Jenny Scheinman, who really explorethose avenues. Too soft pop for no purpose for me this time."
1,Let The Fire Die,"I'm disappointed with Nickel Creek. When I first heard their self titled CD, I had appointed them my official Bluegrass group. You see, I really don't listen to country or bluegrass and I was happy to have this talented group lead me down this road. But I discovered, after buying their second CD, ""This Side"", that they were leading me down the wrong road. I kept faith that they would, by their next CD, get back on path, but I see now that they are on an entirely different path and I cannot follow. I'm hurt. I would give this CD less than a star, but I'm not able."
1,"If I could give this zero stars, I would.","Ok, Ok, Ok....I get it....the impetus for Chris Thile, and now apparently the Watkins duo is to push the envelope....WAAAAYYYYYY out until it tears.Here's how I mark good songwriting, and good recording: Do I hear the melodies after the cd is stopped playing? Do they stick in my head? Do I remember ANY of it?In this case, maybe one song, the cover of the dylan song. The rest completely and utterly suck. At some point being wierd ceases to sell. What you have here is people buying into wierd, unevenly written, poorly produced music because they think it's intellectual. It's not. It's just so much paint splattered on an audio wall.Chris, hang up the mando and go join ""Beck's"" band. You carry the same appeal. You both suck."
1,"Wow, soooo bad.....","I guess you have to be a poor, uneducated, American caucasian male to like this one. Wow, Americans have such horrible taste. I can imagine a bunch of lame highschool kids listening to this one while on their way to their prom wearing ill-fitting rented tuxedos with dates sporting wrist corsages and hairsprayed bangs. Why would anyone buy this load? I'm bummed that I listened to the sample provided on Amazon."
2,disapointed!,"I really enjoy Nickel Creek, but was disappointed by this effort.As a song writer I know you only write about what you have experienced. These people are extraordinary musicians, but haven't experienced enough life to write great songs. Each song on this album was predictable after hearing the first and boring. Nickel Creek has never been boring before."
5,Getting used to,"I eagerly awaited their new CD, and when I first heard it - I was disappointed. It was nothing like their other two. But I have to admit - this CD grows on me more and more. The lyrics are incredible and the trio demonstrates growth and depth with this new work. Helena is my favorite. The darkness and haunting scenario seems all too real. If nothing, Nickle Creek shows their versatility with this CD. I am glad I gave this CD a second chance."
2,What Genre are they?,"I think the technical aspects of the production are tremendous. However I personally did not enjoy listening to the cuts - they left me feeling ""blue"" except for a couple of cuts.Mind you, as a bluegrass fan maybe I was expecting more conformance - on the other hand I like many other genre's. I do not like eclectic, new age stuff. So this may be just taste and preference. I do know however that they are skillful and I commend them for artistic expression."
2,Barely Any Spark!,"Where has our beloved Nickel Creek gone? In their first two albums, Nickel Creek's music was pure exuberance. I loved their modernized bluegrass sound that was totally their own. Why now are they trying to sound like someone else? I think it's great to experiment with your sound and try to improve it, but there are already too many lazy acoustic pop bands. A better way to experiment is like with their track, ""Should've Known Better""--one of my favorite songs. Bring back the inspiration! Fans that have loved Nickel Creek from the beginning will be sorely disappointed with this album which is ironically named, ""Why should the fire die?!"" My advice to Nickel Creek. . Stop trying to be Coldplay or even The Beatles and go back to the unique, joyful sound I fell in love with! Hey Alison, who's next?"
1,VERY Disappointed,"I had the albums ""Nickelcreek and ""This Side"" on an mp3 disc that I recently listened to, and it reminded me how much I like this group. I wanted more. So I ordered ""Why Should The Fire Die"". VERY disappointing. It's not at all pleasant to my ears. It brings to mind the worst of the real weird stuff the Beatles occasionally came up with. If Alison Krause's involvement made that much difference, then they need Alison back! I can only hope that this album is a total flop for Nickelcreek so they'll go back to making that fantastic music they're known for. After this album, who knows, maybe the fire will indeed die."
4,The good old Nickel Creek is Back,"Why Should the Fire Die? is Nickel Creek's 3rd release, and brings back the good music of their self-titled release. Their second release, This Side, had too much singing, and fluffy words. Why Should the Fire Die? incorporates more instrumentals, and more thoughtful lyrics. I am enjoying this CD a lot!"
5,Best Yet!,I have been a fan of Nickel Creek since I first heard their 2000 self titled album. I believe that this CD is better than their last one (This Side) and is equal to their first one. I cannot stop listening to Doubting Thomas on this CD. I highly suggest that people buy this album and listen to it. It touches the heart.
3,Why Should the Fire Die?,Not their best effort. They seem to have moved away from their original style. I prefer a stronger acent on the Bluegrass aspect.
2,Don't waste your money!,"Whoever made this video blew good money on a horrible plot and second & third string actors. I bought it as a gift, i was embarrassed because it was so bad.Riverdance would have been a better selection..Oh well. My husband normally loves Yancy butler, but in this movie, she's portrayed disrespectfully in ill taste, and must have needed money to buy her weekly bottle of booze...Don't waste your money!Any other video would be a better purchase."
3,The Dictionary of Pirates,"It is worthwhile to own this book as it provides much info.--fact and fiction. It is well presented and, to the best of my ability, accurate in its facts. It gave me several pirate film reviews that I was not aware of or didn't have plus several tidbits of pirate info on bio's.The only drawback to the book was the size of the print. It was terribly small--about 3-4 point font size and, though I do wear glasses, it was extremely difficult to read such small print. That is why I didn't give it a better rating. But that is my ONLY complaint with the book. Otherwise, I am happy I bought it, read it and have it available in my library now for future refernce. (...)"
4,"Interesting, but quite a challenge","I found this book quite interesting. It covered everything from the dawn of civilization to the fall of communism, and gave an excellent analysis.I also found this book quite a challenge. I don't consider myself to be of inferior intelligence, and am a graduate of a highly ranked university, but on many occasions I found myself using a dictionary in order to understand some of the vocabulary in the book.This book is not for the faint of heart, nor the high school dropout. However, for those people with a desire for historical knowledge and the willingness to take up a challenge, this book is well worth the time."
1,Did Van Gogh use soy sauce to paint?,"I am talking about the 2001 edition. The printing quality is HORRIBLE. The colors are WAY OFF. In fact, they are disgusting. Absolutely completely unacceptable! What an insult to Van Gogh! (The book was printed in Slovenia.) I am returning the book tomorrow. If we tolerate bad quality, the publisher will never learn a lesson and never improve their business."
1,"Wrong Book ,correct review","You have included a five star review for this book that is meant for the 1997 edition,not this printing. This is very confusing. This review is what led me to buy this book and in reality the review says this particular printing is very bad."
1,The low price matches the quality.,"Save your money and buy a better quality book. Sometimes you get a treasure for a low price, this two book set is not one of them. The colors are muddy and lack any kind of life."
3,Acceptable?,"I bought this book because I needed volume 2 only. The product was described as ""acceptable"", but it was missing 2 pages,the binding was falling apart and some pages completely detached. A little Elmer's glue fixed the binding, but the pages are still missing."
2,Disapointed,"I was familiar with this set of books titled Vincent van Gogh, the Complete Paintings. It consists of 2 volumes and is seven hundred something pages that is housed in a cardboard case to protect the dust jackets. That is what I ordered and I received volume one only. The description on the website did not indicate that it was half of the set. The emails to the company were not helpful. I am very unhappy.Vincent Van Gogh: The Complete Paintings"
1,"Didn't get the whole Vincent Van Gogh: The book, only part 2","I feel ripped off in that the description of the book said the complete works of Van Gogh, and I thought it was 1 big book. Instead I got a much smaller hardbound, only part 2!"
4,Practical guide to objects,"This book is good on objects, even if you don't want to program in Java. It's also good for beginners as well as those who think they know a lot!"
3,"Great reviews of covered trails, but non-comprehensive","The descriptions of the trails included in the book are fantastic. It even comes complete with suggested rides, special comments, and other relevant information about the trails. It does, however, have very few trails near Portland. There are multiple trails in the Portland/Salem area that are not covered."
3,Wonderful stories . . .With No Summary or Commone Themes,"Professor Lawrence-Lightfoot has presented some wonderful stories of some very engaging people. I enjoyed reading about their lives and the author's involvement with them. The book had the potential to provide a real service to all of us struggling with this area of behavior and specifically to those of us trying to help others give respect. However, the book just comes to a dead stop at the end of the last story . . .with no effort to pull together the common themes about respect---what have learned about being respectful? How can we be more respectful? It's up to the reader to go back and dig out the learnings from these stories. I subsequently wrote to the author asking for more information or a summary of respectful behaviours and she, in turn, turned my request over to her graduate assistant in a gesture that was profoundly disrepectful."
5,"an important book, to be read slowly.","I attended a three day conference in Utah recently at which Sarah Lawrence Lightfoot was guest speaker. The topic of her speech was centered on giving and getting respect, and she read liberally from the book's last chapter. It was profoundly moving to listen as she recounted her interview with a family who had lost their 19 year old son to leukemia (?) ... the writing style was near poetic. The emotional intelligence was pure and strong. I have ordered the book and am looking forward to learning more about the reciprocal nature of respect and it's powerful effects."
4,They're very good.,These gloves were just what I was looking for. Just wish they weren't so expensive. But glad we got them.
2,Ordered white. Got hot pink.,It has issues with snagging and unraveling. Replaced it.They were really tight around the wrist _. Uncomfortable to wear. Did not get any better with time.
2,Just not right,This book is just a copy of JMS tutorials from java site and has examples which are written using jmq which is no longer available as it has now become part of iPlanet group and they have broken compatibility (Interfaces have been changed) Not the worst book but certainly worst wrox book i have ever read
2,Rather read Java Tutorials,This book is just a copy of JMS tutorials from java site and has examples which are written using jmq which is no longer available as it has now become part of iPlanet group and they have broken compatibility (Interfaces have been changed) Not the worst book but certainly worst wrox book i have ever read
4,good reference book,"I knew nothing about JMS when I bought this book. What I like about it is that it explains the basic concepts of this technology (or should I say API?), And I personally think this is the most important thing. It then moves slowly on how to exploit all the capabilities of JMS.The book introduces the different aspects of JMS (topics, queues, durable subscribers, etc) and it also explains with java examples. I actually didn't follow much the examples, but I used some code snippets when using it with a different application server. So it also helps.Anyways, you can always refer back to this book if you have any JMS doubts"
4,New big wave for messaging,"I expect that with introduction of JMS and Message Driven Beans which are based on this technology we will see very big movement towards implementing various application scenarious based on JMS. This book definitely could help you to decide what should be taken in account. I also like chapter on Clustering and Scalability - each enterprise (and you as developer for this enterprise) should think about this during design stage. List of various JMS providers (SonicMQ, IBM MQ Series, FioranoMQ, WebLogic) and implemented by them features could also be helpful."
5,Good reference for special needs trusts,"Goes over administering SNTs in detail. Good explanation of the mechanisms related to SSI, SSDI, and Medicaid, and how they interact with the SNT. Oriented to Massachusetts law, where the authors are, although should be similar in other states since law is federal with state ""twists"". Has a list of ""do nots"" and ""watch out for"" items that is useful, although the list is spread out through the book, would be useful to have an appendix summarizing them. Has a chapter on web site references to go to for more info. Finally, the tax section I thought was a bit vague, as it didn't distinguish between distributions that are return of corpus vs. return of income, and didn't make some other things clear. Overall, however, a good reference."
2,Worthwhile but not comprehensive,"I bought this book knowing that it was written by trust experts based in Massachusetts, but I was unprepared for the extent to which it focuses on issues specific to that state. I think the authors could have kept that information and broadened coverage of other states. I was also disappointed to find fairly thin treatment of very complicated tax matters regarding trusts, Medicaid, and SSI, and of trustees' obligations to file financial reports to state human resources and finance departments. I thought this would be a more comprehensive source for people overseeing special-needs trusts, but it turns out I need to look at other handbooks."
4,refreshing,"Pleasantly surprised by this, it smells wonderful, gets my hair clean and doesn't strip my hair as some shampoos do."
4,Uplifting scent and clean hair!,"Waking up for work on Monday isn't fun but it's much better with EO's Sweet Orange Shampoo. Orange, actually all citrus scents, are uplifting and this shampoo is a great way to get the sleepiness out of your system. Plus it leaves your hair feeling clean and lightweight."
5,Smells Great,"I love this shampoo, it leaves my hair feeling clean and soft. There are no harsh chemicals, so I feel comfortable using it on my highlighted hair."
2,This CD dosn't excite .....,"I found this CD in a used CD bin and purchased it as I had been looking for it for awhile. It is OK, but does not live up to expectations. Its not a CD that will get a lot of play in my collection"
5,As Hard-Boiled As They Come,"Who knows if this well-told story of love, murder, and betrayal would still be in print were it not for Jacques Tourneur's magnificent adaptation of it--OUT OF THE PAST starring Robert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas. I'd seen the film many times before I'd ever read the book; and whereas the film is both tough and tender, the tenderness of the novel by Geoffrey Homes (who penned the sharply-written screenplay as well) is downright poetic--and is surprisingly well-integrated into what is, at heart, a detective novel. All the double-crossing of the book makes it into the film intact, but the film adds a depth to it that leaves you breathless at the conclusion. A cynical, despairing work of art that stands out in the hard-boiled genre for the beauty of its prose and the depth of its tragedy."
3,Out of the Past,"The basis for the great RKO film Out of the Past, Build my Gallows High is a fine 40's crime thriller. Weighing in at 153 pages this is really only of interest as a companion piece to the film. The narrative is much more straightforward than the film, character names changed, combined or eliminated. Although the book and film were structured differently, I found it difficult to not imagine Mitchum and the others as I read the story (the images of the film are seared into my brain). I love the film and liked the book. Interesting note that the author of this novel (Daniel Mainwaring under the pseudonym Geoffrey Holmes) also was the adapter for the film. I love to read books that have been turned into the great films, this is not essential reading."
3,SPANISH FOR SUMMER,This was purchased for my 9 yr old son. One of his requirements set by my husband and I was to study and possibly learn a little Spanish this summer. He is enjoying the software and is also reading a book with Spanish phrases and words.
4,Very Detailed,"Typical Raymond Keene style writing, he notes every detail possible and makes you feel like you were watching the game live."
4,Another good Wrox book,"This book is well written and on a whole well executed. The two sample projects that he walks you through I thought were excellent additions to the book. The author also gives you a brief background of the GNOME project and how it is different from KDE which uses QT.One thing I did not like about this book was the fact he does not give any mention to GTK-- which is the C++ kit or any of the many other languages that can take advantage of GTK beyond acknowledging it's existance. It would have been really nice for this book to have had a chapter on other languages and GTK.Also the chapter on the rapid application development (AKA RAD) tool GLADE was rather skimpy.However if you are a C programmer looking for a good GTK book, look no further."
3,"Great book to research models, but...","As usual, Felicia Browell did a wonderful job compiling what must be huge amounts of information on Breyer horses. The book presents each model in a very organized fashion. However, I was **very** disappointed with the photographic quality of most of the photos of the models, especially when I compare them to the earlier editions of this book. I'm not sure if maybe the publisher is at fault for this or not, but the copy of the book that I purchased contains photos that have a VERY prominent orange tint to them. This makes it hard to match the horses' colors in the photos to models in real life. The chestnuts and bays actually look ORANGE in many of the photos (they practically GLOW on the page). I hope that a future printing of the book corrects this issue."
4,Not what i expected,"For those of you familiar with Arab Strap, you are probably expecting something very reminiscent. Well, though this album has similar aspects, for example sadness, it is quite different. Well sorta, its like pop-postrock and i apologize for that awful genre i just made up. well you see, he actually sings on this one, unlike his lazy muttering on the arab strap releases. i think this album is superb, but maybe i'm only saying that because i'm a canadian, and that depressed sounding thick scottish accent is so different and foreign to me that i can't help myself."
2,"BeWARE, MANAGER IS 53 VER!","I Cant BELiEVE, ITS ABSOLUTE SHAME, FOR THE LIFE OF ME THESE IDIOTS ILLEGALY MARKETED MANAGER AS THE FINAL 57 VER. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED WITH 39 as SPECIAL HOSTED BY MEADOWS IN MID 1980s!"
3,Buyer Beware - Last Sketch of the '50s not used!,"For the *second time* MPI Home Video has listed the June 1, 1957 Honeymooners sketch and delivered the earlier version from 1953. This may seem like small potatoes (maybe only to Ralph Kramden), but research shows that the 1957 remake was the historic final sketch of the decade, *plus* (possibly) Gleason's farewell to his '50s variety show. If you're not into television history, and don't mind an apparent production error, you'll still like the '53 sketch, and you'll greatly enjoy the quiet, sentimental gem, ""Hero""."
5,Much improved over 1st ed,"This is much improved from the first edition, with all of the example code written for VC6/ATL3. The authors cover most of the features of ATL in a clear way and is a great way to start learning about ATL. The title is a bit misleading, it is not a 'beginners' book because they get down to the mechanics of ATL straight away."
1,Buy if you wanna be in a soup,When I started with ATL COM I had but little choice apart from this book. Since there are too many heads on each and every WROX book they spoil the broth. IT IS NOT FOR THE BEGINERS NEITHER FOR THE INTERMIDIATE. And now that I have got around 2 and 1/2 years of experience I still find it intimidating.Best way to Start will be1) Read Inside COM (Microsoft) Inside Out.2) Graduate to Andrew Troelsen's Developer's Workshop to COM and ATL 3.0. The best that any one can get.3) And Do read the MSDN.4) For those who want then to jump into COM+ bandwagan read through Pradeep Tapadiya's 'COM+ Programming: A Practical Guide Using Visual C++ and ATL'That will make you day. And hey don't forget to read the postings at develop.com and anything written by Don Box/Jefrey Richter.Bottom Line - STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK
1,simply aweful,"This book promises so much. It has well thought out chapter headings, great diagrams and what appears to be great content. But when you start reading it, the book manages to make the simplest things complicated and convoluted.I would have given it zero stars if I could...it is that bad.I know it sounds extreme, but from this book you won't even understand the concepts you have already mastered.It was so bad I abandoned it at chapter 3 and have marked the cover ""for reference only"".Having bought many, many books from Amazon, this is my first review where I felt so strongly about this book, that I took time out to write this, so that others do not waste their money and more importantly, their time. This book was that bad and I do not exaggerate."
2,NOT for beginners at ALL,"This is not a beginner's guide to ATL COM in any way, shape, or form. The first two chapters are dedicated to getting into the guts of COM and don't deal with ATL at all. This book fails to provide useful examples that a new ATL user can extrapolate from to fit their own similar problems, and it appears to assume several years of experience in C++. If you've never seen COM or ATL before, skip chapters 1 and 2 to start and go to chapter 3. Then after you've read 3,4, and 5, go back and read 1 and 2. I realize the info contained in them is important, but it is usually better to start out simple and get more complex, not the other way around.On the other hand, if you are an advanced user, this is a pretty good reference for exactly what is going on under the hood with ATL."
3,Full of information but glosses over basic important issues,"Approaching ATL (my Windows C/C++ experience very basic too) for the first time I found this book long on heavy discussions what every COM API chunk of code was doing but short on examples that demonstrate the basics of getting data into and out of an ATL server. This is what I'm interested in as a beginner. This is why I buy Wrox books in general. EXAMPLES!Specifically, there are some very important issues with regard to COM and BSTR data types that were barely mentioned however are absolutely essential to get a server to work C-style functions.I feel that a beginning level book should be long on very simple examples of wide ranging applications. e.g. inputs, COM specific data typing issues, outputs, access from multiple client types. A lot of the discussions of the COM plummbing would be beter left to an intermediate book."
1,Too many Greatest Hits Albums,Chris Deburgh simply has more live and greatest hits albums with the same songs than he has original albums...does that tell you anything?
5,The most entertaining book I've read in a long time.,"Prep is the most entertaining book I?ve read in a long time. Coburn invites us into a community not often discussed, and takes us for a surprising ride full of edgy themes, mysterious character development, and compelling language.A nice break from novels that try too hard to reflect pop culture, Prep made me wish I was back in high school.I recommend Prep for readers of all ages who enjoy adventuresome and emotional reading. I recommend Prep especially for readers who wish to remember how exciting it was, or could have been, when we were teenagers who just wanted to live our lives."
4,Don't judge it by its title,"Despite it's strong title and the title of the last chapter (""The Road to Hell""), this book is actually very mild and straightforward. It does not portray ""Science"" as historically and actively seeking to overthrow religion. It merely illustrates a few of the modern areas in which the goals (especially monetary) of certain researchers run roughshod over practically any ethical or moral considerations, not just religious views. What may be most surprising to most readers is that the most recent and most vital cases involve demands for research to be publicly funded but totally free of regulation or even public scrutiny, through means (and perhaps even to ends) that are abhorrent to people from both left and right wings of politics and religion."
1,"The problem is ""religion"" is science....","""Religion"" is man's rational means of reaching God. Catholicism, Muslim, Hindu, Buddha, are all systems of 'works' that are intended to please God. As opposed to Christianity, which is God's word on how He reaches to man, by grace. Thus, all the false religions are ""science"". Man's invention or rationalization. So does science crusade against science? In some cases it does.Also, Christianity (not religion) has been largely misunderstood because of postmodern thought which alleges that ultimate truth cannot be known. For some up to date thinking on the subject read John Koessler's ""True Discipleship: The Art of Following Jesus""; and David Wells,""Above All Worldly Power- Christ In A Postmodern World."""
4,Fun look at a brilliant designer,"Watching this film well over 15 years after it came out, I am amazed at how NOT dated it seems! As a documentary, it is not as polished as today's films are, but there is something wonderfully simple about the film. It does not work totally, but if you can hang in until the end scenes with the actual fashion show, it is totally worth it. I watched it for free on Netfilx, then ended up buying a DVD for $50 on here, so something struck a cord in me : ) Oh, buy this while you can, the prices are shooting up like mad!"
1,Why bother?,"This booklet is truly for dummies. An 8 year-old could figure out more than this book explains. If you're smart enough to read, the subjects covered can be easily understood without help. It came free with my pen/mouse tablet so I'm not out anything. However, don't pay a dime for this thing, there isn't 5 cents worth of usable information in it."
2,eh...it's free,If you are new to drawing tablets and new to vista this will be a handy little guide for about a week or two...at which point you will know how to do everything you ever will with a drawing tablet and vista...thus not really worth the 9.99 that they say it is valued at. Not to mention the entire contents of this booklet were covered in a tutorial in the Vista operating system after plugging in my tablet.
2,Readable in a few minutes,"I was looking forward to receiving my free ""Windows Vista Pen Support for Dummies Book"" that Amazon offered with the sale of a Wacom Pin tablet. A Small Pamphlet would be a much better description in my mind with limited information, easily readable in a few minutes and not of much value. Since the ""pamphlet"" came for free, including the free shipping, it's OK, but definitely not worth anything near $10 and definitely not close in my visions of a Dummies class brand book."
1,A Joke,"This product is a joke. It's a 3 inch by 3 1/2 inch pamphlet, but you dressed it up to look like a book."
1,Friends don't let friends buy booklets like this,This book is criminally useless. If there is anything in it that is not in the MS instructions it is not much. Amazon should be ashamed to have it offered in conjunction with any product they are selling as the buyer will most asuredly feel like he was suckered in. The only reason anyone would have written this is that all may know they need prayer. It may prove its worth next time I need to start a campfire!
2,2 Stars for being free!,"This came free with my Wacom Intuos 6 x 11 Digital Tablet. I'm giving it two stars for the fact that it was free, but it's not really a book. It's more of a pamphlet with a fancy glossy cover.There's really nothing more to say about it. It's great for a freebie, but if you're expecting an informative booklet you will be disappointed."
5,A significant insight to leadership in modern warfare.,"For me, the great significance of this book is that we get to read detailed accounts of divisional, corps, and army actions by one of the masters of armored warfare -- without the typical self-aggrandizement that comes with time for reflection. His account of the fight into France is the very best accounting of the ""fog of battle"" I've ever read. I consider this a must-read for anyone who wants to gain any understanding of warfare, particulary WWII."
4,The Rommel Papers,I bought this as a gift. The reader is enjoying and sharing it with me. Good purchase. Very small print though.
5,cap21,"I have purchased and read lmost all one person can on Erwin Rommel and really feel ashamed that I never purchesed this book, it is excellent .I encourage any one going into the armed forces ,espeicially a combined arms branch to read this book."
5,The Rommel Papers kept me up late night after night!,"Not a dry military text, The Rommel Papers reads like a novel. This book puts you right into the drivers seat. An incredible account of this centurys greatest warrior. I dare to say no other could have accomplished what he and his men did under the incredibly unequal conditions. A wonderful tribute to a great patriot and human being."
1,Print Quality Poor- Subject Matter Excellent,"I own another printing of this book and hoped to replace it with a newer copy. Well, that is apparently what has happened, I received a ""copy"". The book is smaller in size from my earlier version, and the printing on the page appears to have been ""scanned"" from an existing work and then printed. Looking closely at the lettering and font work throughout the book, you will notice the ""ink-jet-like"" bubbles that attempt to make up the lettering, as well as the light margins where the ""scan"" ends and the actual book paper continues. The subject matter appears intact, but reading this is an eye-strainer at best, and a throw-away at worst. I am disappointed in the quality of the printing! With some effort, I could have accomplished a better reprint using my own scanner and better quality desktop printer."
2,The product is designed to be sold but not to work for too long,"The product is designed to be sold but not to work for too long. Battery was only charging at very odd times, but we were ignoring this as otherwise the player was ""digesting"" all possible formats (media and files) even better than my stationary one, which made this DVD player really irreplaceable for long drives with kids, etc. Well... it did die shortly after ludicrous warranty period (90 days) expired. Technical support is non-existent as all they do is say that warranty is off and you are on your own... Now guess why resellers only carry this product with no refund option? Sorry Mustek... no more products from you for me..."
4,rodger,"I bought this item because the website claimed it plays back in (AVImode) ,that is what i was looking for but it doesnt say you have to burn a disk off of your computer to play back AVI mode!!!!So i sent it back!!! The unit is a really ""sweet"" setup 4 the refurbished price... but i all ready have a portable DVD player!Buying through AMAZON is a wonderful experince.... They are very helpful in everyway...so now i only buy through there site!!!!!!"
1,Used just three times then KAPUT!,I wish I would have read the above reviews before I purchased the MUSTEK. Buyer beware.I suppose you get what you pay for. I encourage you not to waste your money on this unit.
1,This Portable DVD player is horrible!,Too bad when I bought it there wasn't any reviews. The picture quality is extremely bad. HD films doesn't look HD on it. The player shows signs of problem after a month bought. Films stopped suddenly for no apparent reason. The programing doesn't seem to respond to changes. WILL NEVER BUY FROM MUSTEK AGAIN!!!!!!1
5,Goal!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I Had never liked hockey that much until i got this game. It Features different play modes. One is the season mode. You can edit your own lines, trade players, and it keeps players stats. The second is playoffs where you can do the same as above exept for the playoffs. A third is the tournament were you choose an international team. The others ar begginer game, exebition, and skills. This has fairly good graphics exept at times the players become square. It is very fun to play overall. The only other problem is it can take forever to load."
5,"Soft, Absorbant, really wonderful!","I bought these and at first it seemed like they were too much of a pain because they don't have snaps or elastic. But after using them a few times I found now I love them. For my son I started to actually use them backward and fold the ""wings"" in and then twist it a little to meet around his hips. Then I cover it with a Fuzzi Buns or a Mommy's Touch cover and it works great during the day. I love that they are not too expensive and you can get several uses out of a more expensive pocket cover because it doesn't soak through most of the time. For added padding without too much bulk I add an additional Kissaluvs Super Soaker Doubler which just adds some extra absorbency to prolong the use of the pocket cover. I also just lay the inserts on top of the cover, not in the pocket."
1,Ripoff,"Ok, it's great that you can get Greatest Hits 1 and 2 on one cd, however, if you're looking to get the MP3 version, this is a ripoff! Main page on Amazon is VERY misleading! It shows the combined albums and has an area to click to purchase the MP3 for $8.97, but when you click it and it takes you to the MP3 store, it's only Greatest Hits Vol. 1....NOT both 1 and 2 as the previous page leads you to believe."
5,THIS ONE'S THE PLACE TO START,"Linda's had quite a few careers, now, as a singer. She sang old torch ballads; she sang the part of Mabel in The Pirates Of Penzance; she even tried to cut it as a new-waver. There was ALSO that period, many, many years ago, when she was the sexiest little country-rocker there ever was (and, in my book, still is).Linda's been one of those cover artists--the kind who'll try to pip somebody else's version of some previously-recorded hit. Artistically she's had varying degees of success with this, but in the present collection there's not one misfire. The way she puts over ""You're No Good"" and ""Heat Wave"" (with a little help from her L.A. session boys, Peter Asher & Andrew Gold), not to mention that hoe-down ""Love Is A Rose"" and ESPECIALLY that irresistible sing-along approach to ""When Will I Be Loved"" let one know instantly why she's considered one of the biggies.Linda's earlier discography was one of the many special things about the seventies."
2,Sound spoils the Show,"What should have been a wonderful overview of Linda Ronstadt's early career is ruined by poor quality mastering, which makes her gorgeous voice sound like she's singing through a brick wall. Looks like I'll have to fork out again for the Rhino records 2002 best of version which reportedly sounds much better. The same goes for Volume 2."
4,Combo Greatest Hits 1 and 2 the better choice,If you like Linda Ronstadt I suggest the combo of greatest hits 1 and 2. I already had 2 so I purchased this to round it out.
4,She Covers Many Styles,"Linda Rondstat is really a quality performer. Her song selection on this greatest hits compilation really covers it all from Motown to tender ballads to country to rock n roll. And Linda's voice gives you so much texture and style. Long Long Time to me is the most beauttiful track on this collection as it is performed with the most ultimate passion. This track alone can make you reflect on where you are going and where you have been. Different Drum is another pleasant ditty with a nice keyboard instrumental support. The upbeat rockers Heatwave and That'll Be The Day really put some oomph into this batch. If your a minor fan, this is the collection to obtain."
5,Best Of Ronstadt up to 1976,"Who could guess that a greatest hits album as good as this one would be way, way to early in a career. This great album was one I had in 1976 on vinyl, and along with most teen-age boys of the time I had a major crush on the lovely Linda. Recently, I saw it on CD and snatched it up.In any case, this is a great collection of Ms. Ronstadt's Country and Country-Rock era; the cover of ""Silver Threads"" is probably my all time favorite country song, and ""Love has no pride"" is one of the most heart wrenching ballads ever recorded. Amazingly, even though these remain some of my all time favorites, Ronstadt just got better and better as a vocalist for three more decades.So here's the deal, this is a best of the early career of one of the finest female vocalist to ever be recorded, and for the price, you can't beat it!"
4,She Covers Many Styles,"Linda Rondstat is really a quality performer. Her song selection on this greatest hits compilation really covers it all from Motown to tender ballads to country to rock n roll. And Linda's voice gives you so much texture and style. Long Long Time to me is the most beauttiful track on this collection as it is performed with the most ultimate passion.

1,i never receved the item,when i asked for it to be diliverd to a differant address i was told that i will have to wait untill it is returned i am still waiting
4,GREAT COLLECTION OF CLASSICS,"This""best of"" album is one of the better compilations from Heep. So many more could have been included but all their music in interchangable meaning another 8 tracks could have replaced these 8 and you could still call it their best! The CD includes the classics ""july Morning"" ""Gypsy""""Easy Living""""Lady In Black""and ""The Wizard"" then sprinkle in a lttle""Bird Of Prey""""Look At Yourself"" complete with a ""Sunrise"" and you cant ask for a better representation of a bands music.You even can tell the way they moved their music with the times and gave their fans a fresh dose of new Heep music.If you cant own them all, own this one. You wont be disapointed!"
3,"A producers greatest hits, perhaps ..but not the fans !","Sure it has great songs, but why would they reliece a greatest hits, and leave off ""Stealing"" or a B side single called ""Why"" Thank goodness The Clasic Anthology CD have finaly arrived. Uriah Heeps Greatest songs are still missing off the CD such as, ""Tales"" and ""Gypsy Live"" 73. I was surpised no songs were taking from the ""Live"" LP. Oh well, prudcers, what do they know?"
3,What Happened?,"Two questions that have always, and will always, plague mankind: How can you release a best of Uriah Heep album that omits ""Stealin'"" and a best of Free that omits ""Wishin Well""? This may be a worthy album for the casual Heep fan who's only going to buy one of their albums, but for the more serious listener, ""Classic Heep: Anthology"" is the one to get. Crucified by the critics but adored by hard rock connoisseurs, Uriah Heep is the Rodney Dangerfield of metal."
5,Sweet Heep,"Great disc. I you're into Uriah Heep you should pick this one up. Had it years ago left, it in CD player a rental car. Had to get it again. Also check out Demons and Wizards by Uriah Heep. Both awesome CDs."
2,Not enough,"Now all the songs included are great. BUT-n the disc is shamelessly short- it doesn't even go further then to 1972, whilethe band was in their prime (more or less) up to 1976's Firefly.Not enough. Even some of the best songs by Heep from the era this album represents are missing. Look elsewhere."
3,myspace.com/barropanama,"i had this vhs when i was like 17 and then i lost it. recently, about 12 years later, i missed it and bought it, i think i missed images of fletcher puking, some surfer dudes fighting at the gigs and some other stuff. its really short , but its got nice footage of rancid's tim palying along with pennywise on bro hymn and jason thirsk, former bass player, before he passed away."
4,Pennywise DVD,"The DVD was delivered efficiently and item was wrapped in mint condition. However, my only concern (and reason for giving it 4 stars and not 5) is because the DVD was loosely moving around in its case. When I took the case out of the mailing envelope, I noticed that it must've come off its clip during delivery or the clip could've possibly been broken. I couldn't open the DVD case to make sure of this because it was bought as a gift to someone and I wanted to keep the wrapping on. However, I still recommend this seller."
3,I Was Mislead too,"I thought I was getting the original versions as well. The info in the liner notes were helpful but I was disappointed that I wasn't hearing the songs of my youth. Now, I'll have to reorder ANOTHER cd as I love Ms. Mason's voice.Barbara Mason fans should have been warned when ordering."
3,"Fair, a remastered lesson","I thought I was ordering a compilation of the very best by Barbara Mason as an original recording. I was extremely upset. All of the best hits were on the CD, however, ""remastered"" !!I have learned an extremely important lesson about REMASTERED.Would like to know if these hits are on another CD in their original format."
3,A Bit Disappointed,"Although I actually own a few of Barbara's original 45's from the 60's, I am disappointed that songs like ""KEEP HIM"" are not included in any of these albums. She is truly one of the greatest love song singers in R & B history. She's always been my favorite female singers. Please include all of her 45 rpm songs if possible in future recordings. Thanks!"
1,BEWARE OF RE-RECORDINGS!!!,"These are all remakes, and not especially good ones at that.Get ""The Best of The Buddah Years"" for the original versions of Barbara's best Buddah work, plus a great re-recording of ""Yes I'm Ready"" which is totally different from the original and deserving of a place on this compilation in its own right."
5,Very good!,"I was very well pleased with the way this series played out, the ending was exactly what I was wanting, all the ends neatly tied up."
5,"Delightful, playful and tuneful","I have owned this cd since the mid 80's, and return to it again and again. It is charming and bright, and my children, when they were young, would love to dance when I put this on. Often this music is presented in a very dry and academic manner: it is refreshing to hear it played with such a great sense of fun: you can imagine a true ""Renaissance Revel"". I especially found the anonymous French dances infectiously happy. It is simple music making, and the sounds of some of the instruments may be a bit unfamiliar, and to some, a bit raucous, but done with great skill and verve. Listen to the samples: if you like them, you'll love the whole disc."
3,Overall a strong Very Good CD,"A very good CD for Renaissance type music, but not an excellent one. If you have tons of this sort of music already, then buy this one for something a bit different."
5,womens eastland Grace slipon,I love love love these shoes! I have problem feet!!! I can wear these all day and my feet feel great. Plus they look great with slacks or jeans they are both stylish and comfortable. I have tried other brands going for $110. and sent them back. They do not compare with the good fit of these shoes. Eastland shoes are an exceptional buy for the quality and durability that you get.
5,Great Book for EJB professionals !!!!,"Once again Great work from Wrox Publications. Being aco-technical reviewer, i found this book as a perfect book for EJB professional. Best thing of this book is its excellent classification and categorization of topics. Some of the mind blowing chapter of this book is on integeration of EJB with COM and CORBA , Design strategies, Performance and scability , EJB Testing , EJB Wirleless."
1,Not an EJB Book that I Wanted,"The authors tochs all the topics but hardly in details. They wrote 700+ pages and tried to cover every aspect of Enterprise Java Development: every major Java API, tie-ins/comparisons to CORBA and COM/COM+, EJB etc.I was disappointed because I was looking for solid direction on architecting Java Enterprise Applications. The book constantly presents what a Java API (or CORBA model, etc.) can do for you. Only in a few instances does it clearly help you weigh the strengths/weaknesses of alternative approaches to solve a problem.What you are left with is an overload of information but nowhere to ""store"" the information in your mind."
2,Not much of use to a real time developers,"The book covers lot about EJB theoretically, talks about patterns . This information is good for a new Developer, but certainly not justifies real time environment development. Moreover, the seamless presentation gets disturbed as too many authors implementing their skills with different approach.But i must say that, this book comes handy for a begineers.."
1,"Complete, But Copies from Other Titles","This book covers almost all of the J2EE topics, thats great. But if you already have ""Wrox Professional's"" other titles related to J2EE/EJB then stay away. This book just repeats the excerpts from those."
3,Initial chapters were OK then ...,"I'm beginner in EJB.Initial chapters were OK , which I was able to run all of them.But in Chapter 5, written by Daniel O'Connor doesn't even work.The source code in the book is different upsidedown from downloaded source code from Wrox.What is good for if I'm not even able to execute due to bug in source file."
1,Not Recommended,"i am a fan of Wrox Books, specially books on EJB, J2EE, JSP related technologies. i strongly belives that this book no where comes near the standard set by Wrox's book on J2EE.Not worth buying"
2,not so good,"First 4 chapters of this book are confusing, comparedto other ejb books from oreilly. don't pick this bookif you want to learn ejb better."
5,Small Plush Squid,"This is the best toy squid I have ever seen. It is truly squidlike, yet soft and cute. The texture is near-hypnotic. Anyone seeking a stuffed squid could do no better."
2,Incredibly difficult to mount or remove,"I'd love to give this tire less than two stars but I am reluctant to do that to a product I never got to try. I have been riding 20+ years and I have never encountered a tire this difficult to install or remove. I went out and purchased tire levers for the first time. No luck. The guy in the shop was able to do it in two minutes, but guess what? I discovered I'd punctured the tube and now can't get the damn thing off.Am I incompetent? Probably. Is there any reason for a tire to be this difficult? No ****ing way."
1,SOLAR GARBAGE !!!!!!!!!!!,CAUTION....stay clear of these glasses....don't waste your money...they are JUNK / GARBAGE...I threw mine right in the trash !!!!!!
1,"One ticket to Mars, please.","Yes, these are the same brand/style shades given to us by the Ophthalmologist whenever pupils are dilated...and, for those of us with sun sensitive eyes and glasses, we end up using them, sans case, until they're so scratched, we can barely see out of them any more.Love the design, hate the color of these. Amber doesn't just take the glare away, it transports you to a different planet: Mars.Get the standard smoke colored to be on the safe side."
1,poorly advertized,"These were listed on amazon as solar shield Amber, I had amber before the one's i got were more orange than amber. Does not cut glare at all. They would not take them back either. Advertize as large and they do not even fit over my glasses. Do NOT but these!!!"
2,Didn't fit,I ordered this to fit over my existing glasses which are big. This pair didn't fit and so I had to return it.
3,what you'd expect,"They fall down quite a bit. There is constant adjusting, but what do you expect for the price. All in all it's worth the few bucks it cost but don't feel you've scored a huge win; simply what you pid for."
1,Offensive and Trivializing,"While at times amusing, I was never able to get past the very offensive and stupid premise of this film, that someone ( a rather unlikable cad of a character )tries to get his boyfriend back ( whom he mistreated and cheated on, apparently ) by pretending he has a serious cancer. That he gets the help of his doctor by giving his clinic a big check is all the more disgusting. I felt sorry for the boyfriend, who seemed decent enough. Much of the writing and acting is very broad and not very good. Some of the characters are written as if they were cardboard cut-outs. A truly sick little film."
1,"great download, terrible movie","This was a horrible movie, that i can not believe I sat through, what a terribe basis to base a movie. Lies and deception throughout this movie"
4,Funny!,"I enjoyed watching this campy movie. It was hillarious. I chose this movie based on comedy, and I got it. The best part of the movie is when he realizes people are moving in, when he thought his secret was just kept that, a secret. Now he still has to pretend. The only character I did not get into is the friend's father. He looks to be around 110 yrs old, and no acting skills. Oh well, the movie itself was great."
1,Who gave this the green light?!!!,"I watch movies a LOT and am interested, engrossed by many genres as long as they're well done technically or even mildly entertaining. This one ain't. The actors are so breathtakingly bad, they immediately make it clear how difficult good acting, writing, directly, and movie-making truly is. Holy crappola, this movie just stinks."
4,"Wacky - and with Ben Lutz, too","Hilarious, totally wacky and, despite prim naysayers here at Amazon and IMDB, quite wonderful. And Sweet -- and there ain't nowhere near enough of that going 'round. Bought it sight unseen 'cause it starred Ben Lutz, who (a) is drop dead gorgeous IMHO, and (b) unquestionably had the funniest line in the whole movie of BITE MARKS (which I originally bought 'cause it had Windham Beacham in it).Now, if some enterprising director would just put Ben Lutz and Barry Zito, the SF Giants' pitcher, in a romantic comedy together! (They look enough alike to be at least cousins. So since I was not bothered by FROM BEGINNING TO END, I think that would be really neat, and hot -- and never mind Barry's baseball statistics! I'd pay to see those two together as readily and happily as I go to AT&T; Park to see Barry!!!!!Enjoy this insane piece of fluff. Madcap, zany, sweet and, in places, really, really funny."
3,Love and hate The Love Patient,"I don't particularly like the main character or the story in general. However, it has decent acting, a few laugh-out-loud moments, good production quality, and a happy ending. So, as far as gay romantic comedies go, I say this one makes it into the green (but not by much)."
3,It is ok,It is ok. Some over acting. But it is not terrible. I have seen worse. I am neutral on this movie.
2,Unusual and disappointing.,The premise was not something I was comfortable with but decided to give the movie a chance. The actors struggled to keep a lame script alive.
2,Not a like able Lead,"I had no sympathy for the lead and the horrible things he did, so I could not laugh as if it were funny, or empathize with him. Don't Reccomend this movie,"
3,Don't be too hard on this film,"Yes, it is a bit corny, and flawed. Yes, it has a few minor weaknesses in the acting and in production. Yes, the story line is not even remotely realistic.So what! It is a sweet, sexy love story that could have gone horribly wrong, given the subject matter. I mean, it is hard to make light of cancer and hard to make light of what the main character and his Doctor did, but if you suspend reality a bit and just go with it, you may just enjoy this film. I certainly did.It had its funny moments throughout, and the two main characters are easy on the eyes.To really enjoy this story, just don't take it too seriously, don't expect too much from it, but sit back and fall in love with falling in love. Do that and this movie is hit. I personally loved it and laughed several times, and found myself smiling throughout.Enjoy"
3,cute!,This was a cute movie! worth the rental but very unrealistic! If someone did this to me they would have my foot in their ass!
1,Perpetuating Sexuality Stereotypes,This movie is absolutely the most dissatisfying order I have made on Amazon. It is completely stereotyped down to the last character and probably some of the worst writing and acting I have ever seen. It's a wonder why people think homosexuals are all one-sided comedic people and are portrayed as such ludicrous characters. DO not watch this film unless you plan on being abhorrently insulted...
3,Love Patient needs more Love,"Disappointed in yet another gay themed movie. With Hollywood brimming with gay writers, directors, and actors, why do we still get 'less than' from gay movies. The movie is built on a hoax of the most serious kind. The only serious actor was the bf who left the lead and yet came back to him in the end. YUCK. Little entertainment. Less annoying if you ignore the less than quality of the video, the less than acting, and the less than weak plot."
2,OMG.,"I did not like this movie. At all. I saw the trailer and I thought, ""Hm, this might be good."" I mean, it looked good. But, alas. The characters were believable, and I felt like I would've appreciated the story line more if I would've been reading it as a book instead of watching it. The actors, however, couldn't really act all. The main character, Paul, annoyed the hell out of me with that sarcastic smirk he wore throughout almost the entire movie. And (I might sound like a bit of a b-word here, but) I did not find any of the actors remotely attractive (except for maybe Ted)which is kind of important for me when trying to get into a movie. All in all, I couldn't really get into this."
2,Sloppy production,"Script is trite but that isn't the worst part. The jump cuts, lighting, stiff, character acting and sloppy continutity doom this conceptually worthy storyline from the start. Even with the low budget, I expected at least an honest attempt to adhere to basic grammar of filmmaking. The director cared little for the craft of moviemaking and it shows. A hastily cranked-out job from start to finish."
1,Terrible Poorly acted movie,"Sometimes bad acting can be forgiven when the movie has some redeeming qualities (like the 4 eating out movies). The premise of Love patient sounded like it could be a funny movie, but right from the open it was just awful. The actors had no chemistry, the acting was bad, the writing was bad. There were almost no funny moments and it was a challenge just to watch it to the end. I would steer clear of this garbage."
4,Great insight into some Japanese business practices,"A Japanese friend gave me this book, and I couldn't put it down. I learned how to present and receive a business card, what a karaoke bar is like (you'll be surprised), and what a salaryman's day is like. I found the most interesting parts to be how the mixed feelings about the role of women were reflected. In one part, women were criticized for wanting to stay in the workplace rather than marry. In another part, women were criticized for spending their days shopping, not having meals ready when their husbands come home, and having affairs. If you are planning a trip to Japan, this book will give you some insight into what the Japanese feel is important for Westerners to know."
2,Excellent Disney film -- disppointing DVD release.,"A Disney favorite finally comes to DVD with some interesting and worthwhile ""extras."" Unfortunately, the film is presented in the ""pan-and-scan"" version, not its original theatrical ratios. These older films, created by Walt himself, appeal to Disney students and collectors, people who truly care about film preservation. A note to Walt Disney Home Video: please release films in widescreen as well as pan-and-scan on the same disc. That way, viewers have the option."
1,No widescreen DVD? No purchase!,"Sorry, Disney Home Video. If you won't release DVDs with their appropriate widescreen aspect ratio, I won't be buying them.""Follow Me, Boys"" is a good film, but you've given it a very poor DVD release by including only a pan & scan version.I would have thought you might have learned from your mistake with ""The Absent-Minded Professor"", which you went back and corrected.At a minimum, you could release both pan & scan AND widescreen on the same DVD or DVD set...PLEASE show some respect for your company's considerable film heritage."
5,One of the greatest family movies of all times,"I first watched this movie about 15 years ago, and have been waiting ever since to buy it. I think the only time it was released on video was around 1982, so finally they decided to release it again so many more generations can enjoy it."
5,Follow Me Boys,Took me back to my youth. Kurt is so cute and I think everyone wanted a Dad like Fred MacMurry.
5,A real classic for your library,"I was looking for this movie to give our son's Boy Scout leader. He had mentioned that he remembered it from a long time ago and would like to see it again. Because our son spent so many years in scouts and earned his Eagle rank, I got a copy for our son, too. He is familiar with Kurt Russell as an adult actor and I thought it would be fun for him to see him when he was a child actor. This movie has Boy Scout adventure and romance and is timeless. We all loved it. Who would have thought today's teenagers would see the value in a movie made in the 1960's...that's how good it is!"
4,Super Movie!,"Kurt Russell was sooo cute as a tough boy in this movie that I almost died when I saw the first scene. Fred MacMurray did a cool job, too. I think this movie was hilarious! I just wished Kurt Russell was in the special features!"
5,Scouters Heaven,"Follow Me, Boys is the all time movie for any Scout or Scouter. This movie really is what Scouting is about,(life and how to make the best of it)this is a great movie from Disney,good humor also. You don't have to be in Scouting to appreciates this Classic"
4,Follow Me Boys,"Hollywood productions rarely capture reality, but this Disney movie starring Fred McMurray comes pretty close. Mr. Disney accurately portrays the essence and the goals of the Boy Scout program. This is a great film for all members of the family."
3,"Follow Me, Boys!",It's a great Disney movie from the 1960's about the Boy Scouts of America. It's a must watch for anyone involved in the Scouting program whether youth or adult.
5,WIDESCREEN vs. FULL SCREEN,"Like most viewers, WIDESCREEN is my preferred format. However, I realize not all movies were filmed that way, especially decades-old ones. The ""Follow Me, Boys"" DVD is presented in the FULLSCREEN aspect ratio of 1.33:1 because that is its original format. It really is a non-issue here. In the meantime, what a true joy it is to see this film again! Let us all join together to implore DISNEY to clear its vaults and re-release all of the older, classic films. They confirm the genius of DISNEY under Walt's guidance, and make one realize how truly GOOD films could be compared with what's available today. Walt knew that an audience would appreciate good values as long as they were served up with some laughter and tears. A wonderful movie!"
4,Good Family Movie,"This is a good wholesome movie to share with the entire family. I wish they still made movies like this! If you are a fan of Fred MacMurray, you will want to add this one to your collection. :)"
1,What a waste of money,"I bought this DVD expecting a program similar to the the one shown on Speed channel. Instead you get an 80 minute DVD of which, only about 15 minutes is devoted to Grand Prix. The remainding ""filler"" material contains incomplete film biogrophies of James Garner + Eva Marie Saint among other useless features. Also contained is extremely graphic footage of a burned driver being literally pulled from a car. For this reason alone (and there are many others) I'll be throwing this DVD in the garbage."
1,This is a Joke!,"Basically what you have here is a short and not all that informative film on the making of ""Grand Prix"" followed by two biographies which consisted mainly of a bunch of theactrical trailers and narration. The racing documentaries at the end were old newsreel clips.I can't believe that anyone thought this was a worthy product."
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"What a farce. The film was incredible, and if you're reading this, you know it. The first feature on this is about 15 minutes of a grainy trailer that was produced at the same time as the movie. The rest is useless or worse. Inaccurate commentary by a lame announcer, and footage of mostly wrecks.I was hoping that this was some of the footage from the SpeedVision show a few years back. Nope.Keep badgering MGM to release the movie on DVD, and forget this."
1,Disappointing,"Only about 15 minutes of footage about 'The Making of Grand Prix' the rest is filler. The 15 minutes were interesting enough, but not particularly informative. Wasn't an expensive purchase, but not really worth the cost."
1,"THE MAKING OF ""GRAND PRIX""","I MADE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING THIS FILM BEFORE BUYINGTHE ""GRAND PRIX"" FILM ITSELF.YOU GET MORE INFORMATION WHEN YOU BUY THE 2 DISC DVDGRAND PRIX FILM AND GO TO BONUS .IT IS THE SAME THING AND MORE.THEY JUST MADE THIS TO GET YOUR MONEY.TAKE MY ADVICE!"
2,More Info needed,"I also wanted to know if this is the same as the original 1966 Grand Prix movie with Yves Monstand, James Garner, Eva St Marie, and Antonio Sabato Jr. Please tell me that this classic DVD is finally being released!"
3,belt clip,"this belt clip was very useful. Before, I would have to dig into my pocket for my phone. but now, I have easy acces to my phone when answering an incoming call."
5,Word Meanings in the New Testament,"My pastor and several lay ministers of my church, my self included, all agree that Word Meanings in the New Testament is a valuable resource for any serious student of the Word of God. It's worth every penny, whatever the cost."
5,THE Benchmark Vietnam War Novel!,"I am well into my third re-read of this book since I purchased it back in the '80's. It is, without a doubt, the best work to come out of the Vietnam War. You will not regret this read."
5,A QUIET CLASSIC--A GREAT STORY AND AN EVEN-GREATER LESSON,"Okay... so there's probably an infinite number of reasons that books go out of print. Well, there's only ONE reason a book is brought back into print: BECAUSE IT IS TOO DARN GOOD TO BE KEPT FROM THOSE WHO TRULY APPRECIATE GREAT, GREAT WRITING! As a former Marine who served in Desert Storm, I will tell you from my heart that I do not believe that a person--military or otherwise--can truly understand, or appreciate, the Viet Nam War as a whole--and the individuals who were there--unless they first read this fine novel."
2,Hugely disappointing,"Perhaps I expected too much given the gushing reviews here. I anticipated a book comparable to a Tom Clancy novel, fictional yet very believable and entertaining. Instead, I found a book that attempted to create far too many characters that were poorly developed and not believable, frequently acting completely out of character. Instead of focusing on what I hoped would be the experience of jungle warfare, this book wastes inordinate time on philosophical discussions about the war and on character's love lives (usually quite awkwardly). Although starting off fairly well, it became a burden to read. I generally read every word of even poor books, but found myself skimming through the last half of this book. The ending was illogical and most disappointing. This book should remain out of print. I regret having tracked down a used copy."
4,"Been there, did it, done it.","I read this book in 1986. The story take please only a short time after I returned home from Vietnam, 101st Airborne. Maybe I enjoyed this book more than others because the story took place in the area of operations where I also served as an infantry squad leader. I could see the trails, smell the jungle, and see the places he described as I read this book. I was misappointed with the ending, not everyone who served in Vietnam died there, some heroes did come home. I did feel the pain of Egan's death, or maybe I was just reliving the deaths of my friends who died in July 1970."
5,The Best Vietnam Novel.,This book was recommended to me by a Marine Vietnam vet. It is the most powerful war novel since Saget's The Forgotten Soldier. You will never forget the characters and the ending.
5,"outstanding, visceral, disturbing book","This book has to be one of the greatest war novels ever written. I read it over a decade ago then recently reread it. It was amazing how vivid and fresh the book's impressions remained with me even after all these years. It has helped me understand and appreciate what my veteran patients went through. It is a beautifully written, gripping, graphic book that captures the horror and madness and random bravery of war."
5,SIMPLY THE BEST (novel about US soldiers in Vietnam),This is the best book I've read about war in Vietnam. It tells story of normal front line (if there ever was a front line in Vietnam) soldier. All characters are excellent and they really come alive in this book. Only negative thing I have to say that paperback edition I read had so small print that it was rather tiring to read.
1,Black & White Pictures?,"Do not waste your time getting this book, just get the larger regional book. Who in the world would put black & white pictures of the birds in this book when the same colored version exists in another book? How cheap can you get! Do not pay more than $5 for this book."
3,Limited colour plates; good organization,"For each bird, Peterson gives field marks, similar species, and where found (overall and within Texas) as the main information; the latter is useful for elimination. Where appropriate he also has sections for voice and nest. The emphasis on field identification is good, with additional sections showing, for example, silhouettes of accipiters, falcons, kites and harriers to show the differences.However, many of the plates are black and white, or line drawings, and this is a significant drawback. For that reason I'd recommend John Tveten's The Birds of Texas instead, although it's not as handy out in the field, and has less coverage of casuals and accidentals. The organization of the Peterson is good enough that you might want to get both."
2,Not enough color pics,"I am an amateur bird watcher in Central Texas. I don't know much about them so ""COLOR"" pictures are very important to me in order to identify them. He describes them well but the pics aren't good. There are no color pics of the Titmice, Swallows,Pigeons, Doves,Purple Martins. These birds are so common and I don't understand why he wouldn't have color pics. So now I have to get another book so I can see pics and tell the difference bewteen a Starling, Purple Martin and some swallows."
2,Not for the Novice,"Sorry, but this book is too complicated for the average person, or maybe it was just us, we wanted to be able to identify different birds that came to our feeder and feel this book would have to be memorized first, to be of any use."
1,save your money,"Within three weeks, this game totally quit working. I could have had more fun taking the money and setting it on fire. BEWARE!"
3,Great Game Great Problems,"First of all this is a great stratagy game of th Gettysburg battle. You can choose to be the Unoin or Confederacy and can choose on 4 different diffultcalty levals. You can to command your troops through to long, gruling, battle. But this has major problems. This has hardly any detail and the graphics absolutly stink. You have a hard time given commands. The high levals are too difulcult almost impossible to beat. You also lose very easy in this game. It is very slow and outdated. I hope they come out with a Gettysburg 2 or something similar because a great game like this deserves better. You should at least try out this game even if you are clueless about the Civil War."
2,"Most of the movies didn't work. No Bowrey Boys, only East Side Kids.",I think it was worth the 8 dollars. Only two movies worked. Both duds. Boo hoo!
1,Rip Off!!!!!!!!,"The condition of these 2 dics set is very bad quality,some plays then stops and some won't evenplay at all.It is a very bad investment to buy this set of The East Side Kids,even though it is justaround eight dollars,8 shows for a dollar each and you caint even enjoy watching them.Not recommended !!!!!!!!"
1,PICTURE of the bear,My child is into barney and I was going to get this movie for him but I would like to see a picture of this bear before I let him watch the movie.Thanx
2,my 4 year old hated it.,My four year old hated this video. She got bored with it after only 5 minutes of watching it.
5,Dracula in Pakistan/The Living Corpse,"Apart from the rare film with English subtitles, there is a running commentary, plus interviews with the director and actors about how the film was made and the censorship problems it faced. The only unsatisfactory item is the documentary on South Asian Horror Cinema. It begins with the Ramsay Brothers and the cheesy products they churned out from the 1970s onwards. Our film predates the Ramsays and Bhakris, and goes back to a far more respectable tradition of mainstream horror/suspense films, beginning with MAHAL in the 1940s. This section cries out for improvement.[[ASIN:B0002V7STI The Living Corpse]"
5,A must!,"This book is amazing, inspiring, full of love, friendship, happiness. I have gifted it to my best friends and family. All great authors."
4,"Awesome, but not the best","It's great! there's tons of gcars to pick from, and several great tracks. As if that weren't enough, you can opt to race them backward or mirrored. And there are several types of racing modes including single Race, two types of championships,and Hot Pursuit, where you can try to outwit the fuzz, or be a cop your self! However, NFS High Stakes is much better, so get it instead if it's more or less the same price."
3,Need for speed 3,"This is an okay game NOT A MUSTBUY!The graphics are terrible but it is kinda fun. The sound is okay but there is way to much screeching. The music is weird but bearable. my advice is don't bother unless you have an up to date video and sound card.Once again not a mustbuy, but mediocre fun."
4,Very good game,"It's my first race game in a PC. The cars look awesome, with reflections on them like you just had a detaling job. You get a really good feel of the speed and the cop car looks beautiful (a corvette that is). The scenery looks awesome and I really like the acuatica and pacifica tracks. You go through a tunnel that looks like an acuarium with neon plants inside. I wish they had some japanese cars though. The smoke is kind of like NES level, not very good, and the dust too. The rain and the snow effects are amazing though. Your windshield gets snow, mud and rain on in the experieced level and I think that's the real kick. In the beginning mode it's a little monotonous. But start the experience d one and then you get an exciting challenge.The replay option is good, but the cars look like old carton boxes running around, maybe is my 64 mb video card. But the gameplay is good. (:)"
2,NFS3 sssssuuuucccccckkkkkkkeeeeddddd!,"When this game first came out in 1998 (yes it WAS that long ago) everyone loved this game. I got this game about a year ago and on my computer (which was just upgraded) the cars didn't even look like cars, they looked like little colored blobs with black circles with a blob of silver on them for wheels. The graphics were horrible but gameplay is good, Hot Pursuit mode is fun for about two races. Handling is VERY unrealistic, all cars handle like they're on a rail (which could be a good thing for less experienced players which I'm NOT). What I thouht of this game: crappy. What you other computer geeks think: sweet (screw you(:"
3,Used to be a great game,"This game is now very old and simply cannot be compared to modern driving games. However, Need For Speed V: Porsche Unleashed, is an excellent, modern game at a cheap price. Put your money there instead.The above is what I wrote a year ago. Recently I re-installed the game just for kicks and was impressed by how fun the game remains. So I giving it one more star (up to three now), though I stand by the evaluation that it is completely outshown by Porsche Unleashed, which can be had for only a few dollars more."
4,A Wonderful game,At First I thought The Grapics were bad and I couldn't out run the police. But I helped my friend download a patch. The Grapichs Were Incredible and later on I wooped those police cars. Over All I think this was a great game. Note: If graphics are bad download the patch ... It really fixes it and it's for free! You can also download cars and other stuff there using the same instructions. Hope You enjoy your game!
4,a forgotten Mariah classic!!!,"SOME FACTS ABOUT THIS CD:* Australian-only retail Mariah CD single* Never released as a single in the US (only as 3-track promo CD for radio stations)* ""Breakdown"" - NOT found in Mariah's Greatest Hits CD!* ""Breakdown"" (Radio Edit)- NOT found anywhere else on any other retail Mariah CD single (as we speak)!!* A classic song and a rare collectible.TRACKLISTING:1. ""Breakdown"" (Radio Edit) 4:15 - feat. Krayzie Bone & Wish Bone2. ""Breakdown"" (The Mo' Thugs Remix) 4:58 - feat. Bone Thugs-N-Harmony3. ""Breakdown"" (Album Version) 4:44 - feat. Krayzie Bone & Wish Bone4. ""Honey"" (Morales Club Dub) 10:585. ""Honey"" (Mo' Honey Dub) 7:23Go get a copy when you can!!!"
3,an ok cd,i actually have this cd. there are 5 songs: three versions of breakdown and two of honey. i really didn't like the last honey version because it was only an instrumental.
5,"I love, love, love it!","My cd arrived promptly and in great condition. I had a cassette tape of this recording for many years, and was so glad to find it available on CD. This is beautiful, gorgeous music!"
5,wonderful,"When people start to talk about Christmas music, this is the music that, for me at least, springs to mind. Something about the authentic sounds and instruments, and about the music itself, from a time before Christmaswas about malls, santas, spending money, and television commercials. The Boston Camerata has a Medieval Christmas recording that is also an excellent companion to this one."
5,Perfect Harmony,Sweet. Any person that has the bigotry decease should view this movie. Lovely music and story. Would like to know who and where the actors are now as adults.
5,Great movie - Received on time,"Great movie. I owned it on VHS and recently wanted the DVD version to share be able to share with more people. This is great....and as always, Amazon.com had what I was looking for at a reasonable price. I recommend this movie to anyone over age 12.Seller sent this product quickly and received in perfect condition."
1,Do NOT buy this video,I purchased this tape and was shocked not only by the poor quality of the music but also by the foul language. i expect better things from a conductor than the f-word every other sentance. Heed my advice- This video is not suitable for anyone under the age of 15.
3,"Oh, Jesus Christ.....","I think Steve McQueen should have flushed this pile and then immediately seen a doctor.The only thing that gives this steamy load any credibility is its host, Mr. Sean McLaughlin. It's nice to see him getting work again- the last I saw of this program's host, he was selling euphimisms to Catholic school children in the park."
5,Easy and Gripping Read,The Roman Polanski version of this book was rated one of the 100 scariest movies of all time and I have to say the same for this book. Read it once you have seen the movie. The one problem with the movie is that it left a lot of questions that the plot never completly explained. The book will take care of all your questions and it will make you want to see the movie again. Plus the book is shinny! Trust me on this one.
5,Excellent Merry Xmas from Vienna,"This video is excellent the songs were great. Being invited to sing by Placido Domingo is a great privilege. Obviously he thinks Michael Bolton's voice warrants this music. Placido and Michael sing a duet of the ""Ave Maria"" that is wonderful, Michael did a great job singing this. He also has a great video on dvd with Luciano Pavarotti, called Pavarotti and Friends For the Children of Bosnia, and also a great duet with Renee Fleming opera singer on another CD of Michael Boltons, ""My Secret Passion"" of all the Italian aria's."
2,"A few inspired moments, but not nearly enough...","Who invited Michael Bolton?There are a few inspired moments in this holiday presentation, but Bolton does not provide them... It is clear he has had no serious vocal training and looks visibly uncomfortable when he actually has to stretch himself beyond soulful wailing in numbers such as ""Fum, Fum, Fum."" Domingo and Huang hold their own nicely, though Domingo's own composition is forgettable. Bolton's ""Joy to the World"" is abysmal, clearly the worst part of the concert, which you can see from the looks on Domingo and Huang's faces. On a brighter note, Steven Mercurio is fantastic and vibrant as ever."
2,I found it disturbing,"I was rather disturbed by this book. The neglectful treatment of this poor little dog was appalling. Despite repeated veterinary warnings that Josie needed to lose weight, the author laughed the warnings off and continuted to overfeed and underexercise until Josie was in a dangerous state of obesity. She was not taken for a veterinary checkup for 2 years and, when she was finally taken, her dental condition was so bad that she had to have 16 teeth removed. And after an incident that left her hobbling around on 3 legs, her ""parents"" were okay with this because she didn't seem to be in pain and delayed veterinary treatment. None of the dogs in this book were spayed or neutered, although it did take place in the 50s, so I don't know if this procedure was performed or even known about during this era."
1,poor purchase,"when first received item, the initial string broke when loading, but pistol seeme dof good solid quality. However, got a new string, installed it, and that portion seems to work fine, but the bolt doesn't really shoot, it kinda pops off and immediately falls to the ground. It is a very disappointing item, I would not recommend that anyone purchase this"
4,Works great,"To those complaining about the safety not working, you assembled it incorrectly. You have the wedge shaped spacer backwards on the bow support. When assembled properly, the bow works as advertised. I am happy with the operation and performance. The only complaint I have is the bolts too cheaply made. The heads come off when shot into my wood target I use for knife throwing. I will look for better bolts."
3,Quick review on crossbow pistol,This little pistol is nice to play with. It will be usefull as soon as I find a way to fix the trigger since it is too stiff when the crossbow is armed. But it's ok for the price
1,WAS VERY HARD TO PUT STRING ON. ONCE ON CAME RIGHT OFF.. VERY WASTEFUL TIME AND MONEY,ONCE WE GOT THE STRING ON THE CROSSBOW IT CAME OFF ON FIRST TRY. SO NO WAY DOES THIS PISTOL CROSSBOW WAS WORTH THE MONEY OR THE TIME WE (YES TWO PEOPLE ) SPENT ON IT.. VERY UNHAPPY 16YEARS OLD...
1,It fell apart,My experience did not start well the product was not delivered because the seller shorted the postage by about .45 which isn’t that much if that was the only problem. But because I have a swing schedule I had to take an hour off of work costing me an additional 17.41. This crossbow was listed on the box as a 20lb draw rather than a 50lb. I still decided to put it together and gave it a test fire. When I fired from 10 feet away with aluminum arrows I could not puncture a piece of cardboard. After that I contacted the seller I was told I could send it back at my expense. Because it would have cost just about as much to send it back as it did for shipping both ways I declined. Overall my experience with Amazon has been great this one I will just chalk this one up as an outlier.
3,False advertising,This item is represented as a 50 lb. crossbow but when I opened the package it is marked right on the box as a 28 lb. crossbow. That's flase advertising. But for the price it's okay for what it is.
1,Broke after one shot,"Got one online just for fun. I followed instructions for assembly and the first shot was great. The second shot snapped it in half. The metal is cheap and literally shattered. I am d*** lucky it didn't snap into my eye. I am not a careless teenager, I am a grown man and experienced with compound and recurve bows. I am very familiar with care and maintenance. I didn't dry fire. Given the poor quality of chinese materials, this is absolutely NOT something I recommend for ANYONE at ANY age. I took photos and hopefully the links will work. DANGEROUS TO SHOOTER, DO NOT BUY.[....]"
3,Fun for funs sake,The best cross bow toy you will ever buy. These little fifty pounders are the neatest thing to build some arm and finger strength and to just have fun target shooting. Good luck and have fun :)
2,Not great,"I bought this exact crossbow at a sporting goods shop, and at first i was super excited. That is, until i opened the package. The bow needs assembly, which is quite difficult. Once the bow is assembled, it is alot of fun, and easy to use. Unfortunately, after repetitive use, the string began to fray, and the actual bow part kept on becoming loose. It is definitely worth the and you will have fun. Make sure to buy extra arrows."
2,Meh.......,"It was a really powerful crossbow, but it had a lot of flaws. Mainly, the thing would'nt [...] back, and once it did, the safety would fail and shoot by its self! Unsafe. It was very hard to [...] back, but when it did work, i was very satisfied. I only got three shots out before the cocking mechanism broke of the rails. oh well."
4,Love this little thing,"First of all, If you don't have experience stringing a bow, you should ask someone for help before attempting to put the string on. After that, this thing is incredible. with proper crossbow maintenance it will last you a long time. This is hands down the deadliest thing one can buy for under 20 dollars."
1,crap,i am not even lieing i just got it got the string on pulled it back put the arrow in pushed the thingy back and the string snaped caps broke hit me and i orderd it april 19th got it like may 1-5th so shipping sucks so i called to get a new sting the day i got it and its may 26th what the heack so they lie and rip you off basically DONT BUY
3,"Good take off, EZEL crash","My first book on JXTA. No quite what i was hoping for, the first couple of chapters are excellent.Working examples accompanied by diagrams and pictures, really helpful.BUT....As soon as Mr Li gets to the EZEL library (which i failed to find) the book gets hugely complicated. Why? Because you can't find the EZEL library (at least not in the edition i had), and part of the book is dedicated to teaching programming JXTA with that library. What if i wanted not to program with EZEL? what if i want to write my own library?At this point i didn't feel comfortable and had to skip those chapters to the working examples at the end, which again were good.If you are starting JXTA then it might be worth reading the first few chapter, but beware of some spelling mistakes and assumptions made regarding your knowledge of Java."
3,A hit and a miss,"""Beyond Tomorrow"" is a low budget little Christmas film that is well worth the watch. It's about 3 businessmen who are killed in a plane crash and their ghosts come back to help a young couple find love and happiness. This film will leave you with a warm, fuzzy feeling. But...BEWARE... the second film on this disc is an adaptation of ""A Christmas Carol"" titled ""Scrooge"" that is a 61 minute abridgement of a 78 minute film. Many key scenes have been deleted. Buy this disc for ""Beyond Tomorrow"" but go elsewhere for the complete version of ""Scrooge""."
4,"Diehard ""A Christmas Carol"" fans","I thought this movie was a nice addition to my Christmas collection. However, my favorite version of ""A Christmas Carol"" that can be called a classic is the 1951 with Alistar Sim. Second favorite only to ""Scrooge"" the musical with Albert Finney. Any newer versions pale by comparison."
3,Pure escapism,"Although published as three separate books, the Tenth Planet trilogy should really have been released as a single compilation. None of the three books are able to stand on their own. As a set, they are a light but engaging read. These books are pure escapist fun, with stereotypical characters, some plausible pseudo science and a fast paced plot. As long as you are not expecting great literature like Gene Wolfe and are prepared for sci fi that is more in the spirit of Edgar Rice Burroughs, you will enjoy this series.In the second book, Earth has learned the terrible secret of the tenth planet. Not content merely to defend themselves against the rapacious Malmuria, Earth breaks out it's stock of antiquated nuclear weapons and prepares to take the battle to the Malmurians on their home turf.If you enjoyed this series then you will probably like the Heritage Trilogy by Ian Douglas, which is far better written."
4,"Good, but not excellent!","The first book of the trilogy was excellent. This book could excel, too, but for the fact that it stops in the middle of the action. I do not mind waiting for ""The Final Assault"", but ""Oblivion"" does not really have an ending. The editors should have waited until the story was complete. Nevertheless, the story is well written and full of tension. I am definitely waiting anxiously for the third book to appear. I think it is very good that you do not have a clue as to how the story will end. The tension is kept up. Hurry up Dean and Kristine!"
3,"Ok, unique perspective.","Hibernating aliens on an orbital asteroid waking up every millenia or so to ""harvest"" the earth...only to find Humankind has evolved, and is now taking offense at their table manners.Interesting scenario, ok book."
1,Wrong book,"Already read the first, bought Oblivion, the book shipped with the Oblivion cover but the Tenth Planet volume 1 text, odd, very odd"
2,Its only saving grace was that it was a very easy read.,"This was a stupid book. It's only saving grace was that it was a very easy read. This trilogy started off with a good premise (aliens on a planet with a 2006 year orbit ""harvest"" large areas of the earth), but just got worse and worse. I don't think the folks hired to write this book (nominally, the ""authors"") cared about it much either."
4,Introductory Analytical Psychology,"From the foreword by C. G. Jung (1956): ""The problem this book is concerned with is one in which I, too, have been interested for a long time. It is now exactly fifty years since I learned, thanks to the association experiment, the role which complexes play in our conscious life . . . Dr. Jacobi has made it her task, in this book, to expound the important connection on the one hand between the individual complex and the universal, instinctual archetype, and on the other hand between this and the symbol. The appearance of her study is the more welcome to me in that the concept of the archetype has given rise to the greatest misunderstandings and -- if one may judge by the adverse criticisms -- must be presumed to be very difficult to comprehend. Anyone, therefore, who has misgivings on this score can seek information in this volume, which also takes account of much of the literature."""
4,"Great book, very illustrative of Jung's work","It is very interesting and accessible, even for the ones not familiar with Jung's theories. It is a good introduction that makes you wanting to know more about C.G. Jung."
1,Pretty but Shallow,"Honestly, I've only had this chest of drawers (coming all the way from Canada mind you!) for two months, and the bottoms are already falling out. It also chipped when I assembled it. This is what you get from buying compressed sawdust."
1,Poor imitation of the real thing.,"The box may say Horowitz Margareten, but the contents scream Manischevitz. As soon as I opened the box and saw the lightly toasted matzo, I knew what was going on, but hope blooms eternal, so I tried it anyway. It was terrible, just like Manischevitz matzo. Obviously, when Manichevitz bought Horowitz Margareten, the only thing they kept was the name. I couldn't even give the stuff away. For those of us who loved the HM matzos, they are irrevocably gone. Manischevitz, you have ruined my Passover!!"
5,Romeo and Juliet,"This film is very deep in its artistic approach, the style, characters, etc., but one of the things that struck me the most was how close it is to a modern Romeo and Juliet. The love they have, the father against that love, the sneaking around to see one another. All in all a wonderful reinterpretation of that story.The acting is fun and not serious, but at the same time it has it's own deepness, we are able to relate to the characters very easily. We all can understand wanting something nice and being told you don't fit in. We can understand that angst in our heart.Lighthearted in its telling of the story, but yet serious in its message, Under the Cherry Moon succeds in being uniquely different in a slew of the sameness."
2,So bad that it's good,"It's not as bad as ""Graffiti Bridge"", but it's inferior to ""Purple Rain"". If this wasn't a flick that starred Prince, I doubt that this movie would have a second glance from those who have seen it. It's only because we get to see the Purple One doing a Morris Day impersonation throughout the entire flick that makes ""Under The Cherry Moon"" watchable. Bottom line: If you are a fan of Prince, would like to see him out of the struggling musician role, laugh with and without intent, and you aren't afraid of artsy camp, then I recommend this movie. You will probably end up calling it a guilty pleasure flick."
1,JUST AWFUL!,"To begin with,PRINCE isn't much of an actor.Yes,he's one of the best artists EVER,but the little man just can't do it up as an actor!I mean,1984's ""Purple Rain"",will be remembered as a classic because it's style and it's legendary soundtrack,not for Prince's acting.This 1986 film proves my case even more that the mysterious genius should stick to music.Because ""Under The Cherry Moon"" is just awful!What's the plot? It makes no sense and it's just plain old silly!It's sad too that the movie was such a flop-creativly & commerically-because the arty Prince was really trying to be inventive here but it just doesn't work.Prince's next feature film,1990's ""Graffiti Bridge"" was lousy toobut atleast it had Morris Day in it!P.S.:Altough this movie is a joke,it's soundtrack,""Parade"",isn't.Forget this movie,but try to get that soundtrack!"
4,Parade soundtrack,"Prince even 2day is one extroidinary entertainer.Under the cherrymoon showsanother aspect of Prince's musical ability plus showmanship. 4get the year? 1986.C00l as ever.Beautiful women,nice locals.BOMB SOUNDTRACK.1 problem 4 the movie? Where is the color version.The movie was filmed in color? Maybe the limited ed will have.Otherwise A must have."
1,too bad there's not a o rating,"prince makes a fool of himself in this annoying,dumb film,which is one of the worst films i've ever seen. the only positive thing about this film is the black and white cinematography."
5,Great Playful Romantic Musical Movie!,"Black&White; Great Cinematography & Direction!Sexy,Funny,Romantic with a Beautiful Soudtrack Songs!Prince & Jerome :Cool Team!Aziza"
3,Not Prince's best perfomance since Purple Rain..........,"This movie was ""just average"" in the eyes of many Prince fans. The quality of this movie was poor but what carried it is the plot and the soundtrack. He later really improve the following year with his best movie after ""Purple Rain"" with the concert/movie ""Sign O"" the Times""........"
3,well worth it for the music videos!!,"lord knows i'm a big fan of prince music but hoo wee this movie (although it looks pretty - beautifully filmed)is BAAAAAD. bad 2 the bone. just as bad as i remember it at the theater back then. it stinks. that said, if you like prince even a little you will love the added 4 videos in the special features: anotherloverholeinyohead (finally!!), kiss, girls & boyz, & mountains. prince's fingerwork at the piano at the movie's intro is also priceless. but that death scene and crazy eye bucking/looking str8 in the camera? umph - prince please don't do that no mo!!! LOL"
3,Under the sophmore jinx,"Admittedly, this movie is no fine piece of cinema, but upon repeated viewings it's actually quite funny. I think the thing that throws most people about it is that they were expecting another Purple Rain, and they don't understand Prince's self-mocking/sarcastic style. This movie is campy and really quite funny. Yes, it drags in parts, and yes the mellowdrama at the end is ridiculous, but this movie about two overdressed gigalos is a real surprise. If you can watch it without trying to judge Prince, I think it's worth the viewing. And contrary to what Prince says about the accompanying album, Parade, I think it's a gem. I also find Prince's direction to be quite inovative for a first timer. Give this movie a chance. I think you'll find it enjoyable.AND TO THE PEOPLE AT WB, BRING IT OUT ON DVD!!!"
3,"Once upon a time in a land called ""Fantasy""","This is not nearly as good as the Purple Rain and Sign o' the Times movies... however, if you are a child of the 80's / hardcore Prince fan, then you already love every corny / self-indulgent second of Under the Cherry Moon. This is Prince at the height of his post Purple Rain out-of-control narcissism and that's what makes it so much fun! Cryptic in-jokes and costume changes run wild to the beat of Prince and the Revolution's quirky funk-pop. The movie isn't given any special treatment in it's transfer to DVD. No 5.1, no commentaries of any kind but the inclusion of the music videos for the songs Mountains, Kiss, Girls & Boys and Anotherloverholenyohead is a nice touch. I wish they would've added the live performance of Prince and the Revolution from the MTV Under the Cherry Moon premiere at Sheridan, Wyoming but I guess that will have to wait for the Under the Cherry Moon: Special Edition. STOP LAUGHING! IT COULD HAPPEN!"
4,Too Gorgeous 4 words,"1st of all if you are a Prince fan, then it is ofcourse the norm, that you have some favortism directed to the film. That would be me included!!! Does he ever not look good on camera??? I love his hair styles throughout the movie. O.K. now on the movie itself; I find the plot of it beautiful. I wish it did; however, show more erotic love scenes. I love the idea of this movie pertaining to the fact to w/ being a male gigolo, and finding love. THIS IS A PRINCE FILM that does not come on to often...this is simply beautiful B&W so clean looking. (...)! to all the naysayers, because Graffiti Bridge is sexy too! This could be a silent film, and I would still get it just to watch him sashay his cute (...)on screen...everything about him is art. More than half of all people even if they tried could not be such as he: An animated piece of expensive art on screen that you want to just watch...cut it out you haters he is GORGEOUS!!!"
1,terrible,I was a die-hard prince fan in the 80's and when I first saw it I though it was good(but I was a kid). I saw it on tv the other day and couldn't believe how stupid this movie really was! He is a terrible actor as were the other cast in the movie. The story line was stupid and he was just too dramatic and feminine in the movie. What woman would want a man walking around in high heel boots and lacey clothes with his back out? The soundtrack is good but prince either needs to take some acting lessons before he does another movie or he needs to stick to singing
4,(Christopher Tracy's Parade),"As a huge Prince fan, I of course enjoyed this movie more than most. I wish it would have been shot in color though. I find most black and white work to be pretentious. The lush scenery and brilliant costumes would have lit the screen up, but oh well... The movie itself is funny, and I feel like Prince deserves more credit. Nothing fancy, just a tale of a romantic spark that ignites a fire. The soundtrack is fantastic and keeps things flowing. ""Sometimes It Snows In April"" at the end is moving and a high point!"
3,"Yeah, it's bad, but it's a classic nonetheless.","Come on, now. Yeah, it's a bad and sinfully self-indulgent movie centering on a self-indulgent , narcissistic but supremely talented and charismatic star. There are some funny moments in this movie. Prince and Jerome Benton have very good comic timing at certain spots, and some great lines emerge. Kristin Scott-Thomas did her best with what little she had and demonstrated the appeal that led to better roles down the line. Pick this up and enjoy the good lines, the cinematography, and the groundbreaking music. And then go out and buy one of the best albums of the era, ""Parade."""
5,two thumbs up!!!!,I have always been a prince fan and this movie is one of the best i've seen. I still take time to watch it whenever I can. Kristen Scott Thomas is beautiful.
5,The Way We Weren't,"The heroine is gutsy, just like I wish I were. The hero is to die for. This is just a great, great book. I wish Isabele Sharpe would write more books so I could read them all right now. I love this book."
5,"For a good time, read Cathie Linz!",Cathie Linz can always be counted on to lift a reader's spirits--especially welcome on a cold wintry day. Her stories are always warm and fun. I know you'll all enjoy this one!
1,Badly Written!!,"What a waste of paper! A seven-year-old could write a better story. It made no sense! It was poorly edited! There were so many exclamation marks! It was distracting!Poor story, nonsensical plot, ridiculous situations...hard to believe this was actually published. Characters were not consistent through the story. For example, Heroine trains for 20 years to kill Bad Guy, Hero tells Heroine to hide in a room with the other women while HE kills Bad Guy and she does! Then Hero tells Heroine he is going to commit suicide so she can leave now and she does!"
5,Excellent Reference,"As a reference book, I can say its excellent, it gives very good examples of nearly every method and property for the subject, of course it needs experience with ADO, its not for new developers need to learn ADO.NET , also it doesn't teach general preferred or strategic ways of doing things, it's a REFERENCE like the book name reflects, and its an excellent reference in one book.Bassam"
2,Only for critical readers,"I have never read a book that is so full of errors. Especially the sections dealing with DataAdapter and DataTable. It seems that the authur tried to write on the topics that he did not really understand.But on the other hand, a book that deals a key technical topic like ADO only but deeply is more valuable than others that deal everthing but only on the surface.If you are a critical reader that usually do not trust everything written, this book could be helpful for you."
3,Lots of typos and poor coding practices,"This book has lots of typos, and many of the variables are incorrectly capitalized as if someone did a reckless search and replace during the editing process. Also, the code examples follow C++ idioms that aren't suitable for C# programming (for example, declaring variables far in advance of their actual use)."
3,"ok, but should have been better.","This book was ok and makes an ok reference. Some areas are covered really well, but it always seemed like when I really needed more details that this book didn't provide them.In addition, there were many many typographical errors such as misspellings, and almost every entry in the index is off by at least a page or two (no joke)."
2,Don't bother,This is a 1981 recording. Goode's 1997 recording of K. 488 (Nonesuch 79489) is much better and there are many good recordings of K 453 by other artists available that are significantly better. So . . . don't bother listening to this one.
2,Another might-have-been,"Alas, the second reviewer is right. You can't hear the piano. I will add this recording to my growing list of recordings of No. 17 which have one or another fatal flaw: inaudible piano, bad pianist, bad orchestra, etc. It seems that Concerto 17, along with Concerto 9, is for some reason very hard to record properly (and of course very hard to play well). Even Piotr Anderszewski, who plays the piece perfectly, can't be heard through speakers. Earphones only."
4,Best Basketball PC Game to date,"I still prefer NBA Live 2000 to any other version, old or new, in the series. It's an excellent game even in 2002 and you can download the latest rosters from a popular NBA Live fan web site, or even download college courts, uni's and teams if you want to (recommended for college fans - it's worth it).2+ years after it's release, NBA Live 2000 still looks good, price is more than worth it. Make sure you have a gamepad for your PC though."
3,Classic 60's British Blues,"When I was a schoolkid in the sixties this was one of the most revered of the 'blues' albums that we used to listen to, along with offerings from Mayall, Fleetwood Mac, Chicken Shack, Keef Hartley etc. I hadn't listened to it for maybe 20 years until I recently bought the CD version via the Internet, from USA (it isn't available in UK). I cannot describe how disappointed I was on hearing it. The quality of the recording is ABYSMAL compared to the original vinyl and I can only imagine that the CD was generated from a very poor quality master tape. If you want this album on CD then I strongly recommend you find an old vinyl copy and have it recorded onto CD. The brilliant 'A Step Further' and 'Raw Sienna' haven't suffered in translation to CD and sound as vibrant and exciting now as they did when originally released."
1,PLease DO NOT BUY This CD!,"The Sound Quality is absolutely TERRIBlE! Just listen to the sound samples offered here , totally life-less mastering .i am amazed at the lack of concern that LONDON RECORDS showed towards putting out a PROFESSIONAL PRODUCT (the British- have usually shown a preference for Utter Clarity and Detail in film,music you name it! ) Please RE-RELEASE these classic albums and let us know you did them again by putting a sticker on the CD package that says ""NEWLY REMASTERED WITH 24 BIT. ETC.,ETC. FOLKS BUY THE LP RECORD AND RECORD IT ONTO CD YOURSELF! IT's not hard top do anymore,there are even people that will do it for you at the price you would normally pay for the CD. Usually i LIKE to support the record companies by purchasing REMASTERED Cd's,but there is absolutely NO REASON TO SUPPORT THIS KIND OF SOUND MANURE! ! By putting out such a bad product you hurt your FUTURE=PUBLIC=IMAGE. Please Take Care........"
5,A must have in any blues collection,A nice addition to my blues collection from an artist who is not as popular as some but was a pioneer in modern blues trends.
2,MOSTLY DISAPPOINTING...,"If you're snooping around for a sample of Savoy Brown, I'd recommend ""Raw Sienna"" over this one: better guitar playing and Chris Youlden's vocals are much stronger (possibly because they were recorded better) on ""R S"". This CD has a few good moments (and some very good vocals from Lonesome Dave on the live cuts) but otherwise pales by comparison."
1,Way Better Option,"This has been remastered and combined with a remastered A Step Further. After reading the terrible reviews here, I was pleasantly surprised with what they were able to do. Well worth the money."
3,Good and mediocre,"""Train to Nowhere"" is fine. ""Ring in His Nose"" is excellent. The rest of the tracks don't stand up to the test of time."
4,Good Beginning Book,"We generally buy this book (and previously Beginning Active Server Pages 2.0) for any new programmers starting on an ASP project. We have used it to train interns and veteran programmers-turned-web-developers alike and both have commented on it's excellent writing and thorough treatment of all relevant topics. The only problem that I have with the book is that some of the code samples tend cause the new developers to think that they should write code for larger projects similarly -- which could be quite a mess. Over all and as a reference, its great. But my suggestion for next time around: improve the code samples!"
4,Good book for the money,"I picked up this book as a reference. I have found a lot of what I was looking for. Examples were written clearly and in details. One thing, however, this book did not get into was pushing errors to the web browser that originated from a VB COM object. Over all, it's well written book."
2,Definately Beginner *Programmer* level,"As another reviewer put it 'Little did I know it should have said Activer Server Pages 3.0 for Beginning Programmers (as opposed to ASP beginners).' Also, while some reviews noted the grammer problems, there are also problems with the index, which often points you to the wrong page (the correct page is usually earlier - they must have added pages after the index was written). There is some ASP material of worth but you have to wade through a lot to find it. It also glosses over some ASP features, such as HTMLencode, which while mentioned, is never discussed in any detail. After all the glowing reviews of this book I was really disappointed. The Pro version (which most reviews warn you away from as being too hard) is a better ASP book even if you are new to ASP."
3,Not a bad book to have.,"I think for a true beginner this book would be a good starting point. I was a bit confused on some of the more advance programming dealing with integrating the asp with a sql DB. I wish the book would had spent more time on this subject and perhaps discussed different options when dealing with the code. I have done some programming and did not find an advantage to create all the extra steps they recommend in building some of their connection and select queries. Still, not a bad book to get you started."
2,Be warned: Many pages are scanned images,"This book in book format may be good, but in the Kindle format beware that many pages (and ALL of the appendixes) are just scanned images of a text page and not actually scanned and converted to text.On the Kindle you can't search for text that is on these pages and they show up small (like an image) on the screen. You have to zoom the image and even then you can't read some of the pages. And, zooming on the Kindle isn't exactly a fast process.If you are a coder and you get this book as a reference manual, then keep in mind that when you search on a term, that your searches will never find any of the pages that are scanned in as images. For me, this defeats the whole advantage the Kindle version has over the book version.The entire appendixes are scanned images of pages and non-searchable and that's where the ASP syntax reference section is located.I'd avoid this book at least the Kindle version."
4,Great Starter Book,"Like the others have said... this is a good starter book for those looking to learn the older ASP technologies, since you may need to know a little of this if you are messing with older sites. I would recommend this book. However, the one thing that is wrong with this book is the MASSIVE amount of grammatical errors and typing errors.Its calling out the wrong variables in certain situanions and mislabeling methods and procedures. Once you are aware this is happening in the book you just need to be mindful and know you aren't crazy, its a typing error. I hope Wrox has started taking their textbooks to the editor and getting them proofread, because it's a shame a book this good is peppered with so many errors.In closing, this is worth the read and it will surely help you on you way to learning ASP 3.0."
5,Technically sound and gramatially friendly,"for technical content, BASP3 is an excellent book; those who have issues with the grammer did not notice the literary style was geared more toward fisrt-person casual interaction - hence the series title ""Programmer-to-Programmer.""Even someone experienced wih ASP (as I was) can benefit from the excellent VBScript reference and ADO explanations. The book provides very hard-to-find information, including how to interface with different types of databases (this is harder to find than you'd think) as well as detailed syntax descriptions for VBScript options (another difficult to find item).This is not a book to learn web development! If you don't already have a good grasp of HTML, start somewhere else. If you've taken HTML as far as you can and are ready to learn dynamic content using ASP, this is the place to start."
5,Excellent Overview to get you up and running,"Covers a broad range of topics well enough to get running with VBscript, ASP and ADO. Occasional typos in the text and code but nothing that wasn't fairly obvious. Outstanding deal for a novice. If you are comfortable with VB already a number of chapters can be skipped but remaining chapters are VERY useful - esp. re: ADO. When looking at similar books make sure they are using ADO rather than the older DAO for DB access. Written in a clear, excellent style that is surprisingly homogenous given the number of authors. Highly recommended."
5,"Excellent,Authorative,Comprehensive","This is one of the best intro books I have ever used. The chapters are well organized and the content is thoroughly explained.When completed, one could write a working useful ASP application based on the solid foundation this book provides you with.What is especially good is the coverage of other topics such as ADO ,XML etc. that other books ignore or assume you have previous knowledge of. I'm really looking forward to the Professional ASP book."
2,Good for the beginner - but where was the editor?,This book very easily gets a beginner up and running with rudimentary ASP examples. My biggest complaint is the lack of editing in this book. Bad writing and grammatical errors were humurous at first...annoying after 700 pages. There is no excuse for publishing a book written this poorly.
5,Good First Book,"I used this book in a class I took on ASP while at the same time using it an internship I had. Though we were never actually instructed to read anything from it, it helped me immensely, especially when on the job and not knowing how to use something the other programmers were talking about. I recommend it for anyone who doesn't know much on the subject yet. I also have the professional ASP 3.0 companion but compared to the beginners book it has remained useless."
4,Excellent book - for the ABSOLUTE beginner.,"This is a great book if you are new to the world of programming and want to get your teeth into some basic ASP development, it walks you through all the basics of programming (or should i say scripting) using VBScript and ASP - but be warned - If you have done any kind of development before youll quickly hit the limits of this book, and may find yourself better off with Professional ASP 3.0"
3,Should Be Clearer On The Target Audience,"This book is decent, but it would be nice if they'd be clearer with their target audience. The first 7 chapeters are virtually useless to anyone with knowledge of html and forms. For them, it can be summed up in one chapter.I bought it because it said beginner ASP. Little did I know it should have said Activer Server Pages 3.0 for Beginning Programmers (as opposed to ASP beginners)."
3,Typographical Errors Abound!,"This book covers the topic completely and in a well-organized manner. The writing style is enjoyable. It is unfortunate that the book is marred by numerous typographical, grammatical and syntactical errors, some of which affect the code samples causing them to either not behave as they were intended to or to fail completely. Book buyers should expect a $40 book to exhibit evidence of careful editing - this book does not."
3,Buy it for the appendices,The book has a great 300 page appendix with valuable information. The book has good coverage of ASP fundamentals. It is geared toward beginners and takes a very slow and repetitive pace. I would have preferred cleaner code examples that used cascading style sheets and perhaps some DHTML too. There are horrendous grammar errors so numerous on every page that it is obvious to me that Wrox Press doesn't employ an editor. I wasted at least three hours rereading sentences throughout this book just trying to decipher the giberish into sensible text (other Wrox books suffer from the same problem). The book is written at about an eighth grade level and style.
3,Too simple even as a beginner's book,"If you have LITTLE experience with programming and internet technology at all, you may find this book helpful. The authors are trying to explain EVERY simple idea in plain English. To anyone who has some basic knowledge in procedural or object-oriented programming, or SQL, this book could be an insult to your intelligence. If you still want to read this book, I suggest you skip all the ""How It Works"" sections because they simply don't explain much beyond what you can learn from the sample code yourself."
2,Did anyone proofread this book?,I haven't seen a programming book ( or for that matter any book ) written so poorly. Even a fifth grader would be disgusted by the sheer grammatical errors in the book. But what takes the cake away are the syntactical errors in the examples of code. The reader is left to do the debugging of the code. What are the publishers charging the $39.99 for???? This book should be free.
2,FIghters Anthology,"This game is pretty fun except for the the fact that it has the worst graphics I have ever seen in a flight simulator. I like the fact that you can be like 50 planes, but whats the fun in that when the graphics are so bad. The landing on also sucks because its so fake, making it a really bad flight sim."
5,Take the Fluff out of teaching!,"As a New York teacher of 20 years, I was finding it more difficult to get quality work out of my students. I kept seeing fluff from them,and I was frustrated. Then I read High Performance Toolbox. I was then able to design projects for the classroom with a clear set of criteria for both the student and I. We then set our course for quality work! Since then I have used the guidelines offered in the book, and have been immensely impressed with the QUALITY work from my students. This is not a book that can be read in a fortnight and be expected to meet the student's needs. One must delve into this with a right attitude, and clear understanding of the philosophy behind the message. But once you have implemented these tools, you will be amazed at the performance of your students! A must for any young professional!"
5,High Proformance Tool Box,"The High Performance Tool Box is an practical, easy to read, hands-on book for the educator. The information provided in the book is common sense materials that require very limited funds to implementresulting in immediate positive and visible results that can be doucmented for student success both at the classroom and district level."
2,Ten Commandments is not well served by making of DVD,"This is not the definitive documentary about the making of this epic film.This DVD uses clips from trailers and black & white newsreels to relate information about the making of ""The Ten Commandments"". Image quality is generally poor. Color is often washed out. Black & white sequences are badly faded and scratched. Unless you are a big fan of the film and want everything that relates to it, this DVD is not recommended. The DVD also has trailers for other biblical and historical epics: Ben-Hur, David & Bathsheba, Solomon & Sheba, The Robe, El Cid. There are also 2 biographical portraits of Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner which use film trailers exclusively. The image quality of the trailers varies from good to poor. However, there are some trailers of films which are not available on video or are quite unfamiliar."
1,YOU DO NOT WANT THIS DVD - Just Terrible,"I just purchased this dvd from Amazon. I watched it for the first and last time, I was very disappointed with it. If you are interested in the behind the scenes and how special effects were done, then THIS IS NOT THE DVD FOR YOU! It basically is a very brief overview on the careers of Charlton Heston & Yul Brenner. DeMille started off well talking about Moses, but once that was over, there was nothing left that was of interest.This is a very sad disappointment and not a documentary in the least. Save your money, Don't bother renting it, save $3.00 !"
1,THOU SHALT NOT STEAL!-Beware this quasi-bootleg!!!!,"Don't be fooled by the packaging, this is essentially ""stolen"" merchandise that is of quasi-legality due to a loophole in the copyright law. PARAMOUNT PICTURES made and OWNS the film ""THE TEN COMMANDMENTS"". The company that produced this supposed ""making-of"" has purloined Paramount's original trailer and production featurette, surrounded it with amateurish garbage and that is what this DVD is. It looks and sounds horrendous. It is a shame the a fine legitimate company like Amazon carries such tripe! BUYER BEWARE!"
1,Poor printing,Dissapointed by the quality of the print of the book.I bought the latest edition. (Mar 2011). Morgan Kaufman publisher have done a terrible job in printing this book. The alphabets comprise of dots similar to save ink option when printing a page.I find reading the book very disgusting.kah
2,"Content is good, but source code contains errors!","This book covers the topic of data preparation very thoroughly.However, it includes source code that won't compile. The book comes up short in referencing the source code that is included on the CD to the various methods that are described in the book. If you don't care about the source code, the book is good. But, if you're a programmer as I am, you expect the source code to work!"
3,Images Of Cambodia,"This is an interesting amateur production, whereby a traveller to the country has compiled his videoes and produced a watchable programme. The commentary is restrained and appropriate and the camera work is quite smooth.I'd like to see more of these, I think there is a valid market for them."
1,Really ugly,"This bracelet is really ugly. If I could give it no stars I would. It is overly huge and disproportionate - too wide and flat, suitable only for a really large person. I had been trying to bend it in shape to make it look acceptable, but that didn't work. Might work as a candlestick holder or curtain tie or something else. This product is an insult to all that is called jewellery. Don't waste $13 on it."
1,The Global brain awakens,"Total nonsens, probably written by somebody who had a little bit to much L.S.D. in the 60's."
4,Good Ole Oldies,"I wish it would tell more about working on Windows 7 or Windows Ultamate, wheather the CD comes with the manual. I only seen one. There is a manual on CD but if your an old timer that can't remember. The manual makes it easier to refer to on problems or hopefully how to do something.My son (29)is having fun, I bought him one for his birthday and thought we could share it. He played it when he was a kid and loved it for a boy. It helped him on the computor, do some reading and thinking about time on crops, when to sell, buy, and plant. He got Mom into it to. This new FarmVille is nothing like it in my opinion.Sim Farm (Jewel Case)"
5,Just like the real deal!!!!,This is a fun and a learning experience game. Just like real life farming. This is a great game for the young to old.
1,Boring,This game wasn't very fun. It could have been a lot better. I've bought a lot of Sim games and this was the worst. No one should buy this game.
1,Very boring and bad graphics,I was really looking forward to this game but when I started playing it I thought the graphics were terrible. I could have lived with that if the game had been a little more interesting but you can only plant crops and feed your livestock for so long before it becomes really boring. I thought there would be a little more to it.
1,tame and lame,"This was a disappointment compared to the other Sim games. Graphics were poor to nonexistent. The worst part is the lack of instructions, and it's a pain to go back and forth to the help screen all the time. Once you figure out what you're doing, you realize it wasn't worth all the effort."
1,sim bored,"I bought this game as a gift, but it has never been played fully as it is such a slow process to set up your farmyard etc. I thought it was going to be similar to 'THE SIMS' - so be prepared to do a lot of prep-work before this game begins to get interesting!!:("
1,Stupid!,"This game is so stupid!Sure,you can learn to farm,but there are no codes!There's no point of playing a game if it has no codes!This is not a game for action lovers!"
3,Item Delivered Was Not As Advertised,"I ordered this cable through Amazon and it was fulfilled by one of their vendor affiliates [...]. Within a couple of days of ordering, I received a call from [...] indicating that the item they had in stock was not in fact the same brand/model number nor shielded as shown on Amazon's site. After discussing my needs, it seemed apparent that the shielding was not needed for my application and I went ahead and let them ship me what they had in stock (I was in a bit of a hurry). The cable I received seems to be well made and is working just fine. So this review is more about the discrepancy between what was advertised vs. what the vendor actually had in stock ... Amazon, you need to be more careful in the consistency aspects of such things."
1,Works for about 1 Month,I have tried a couple times.....but each time I get a new product it works for about a month.Is it really that difficult to manufacture a quality product?
1,great concept but unreliable,"This is a great product in concept - an alarm that shakes your bed works much better than a loud sound, if you leave it on accidentally when you leave your room it won't annoy your neighbors, etc.However, this product itself is unreliable and of shoddy construction. When I first used it I heard small parts clinking around inside, as if there were broken pieces of something inside. After a few months it just stopped working consistently. Some days the alarm would work fine; other days it wouldn't go off for 45 min, other days not at all. I had to throw it out because what use is an alarm clock that doesn't work half the time?"
4,Best alarm clock I have ever owned,"I didn't give it 5 stars because I feel there is always room for improvement, such as a metal case instead of plastic. It really is the best alarm clock i have ever owned though, the super loud alarm sounds more like an air raid siren than an alarm clock, butI haven't had the need to try out the vibration function yet. If it doesn't keep time well at first, just find the little switch under the battery, and flip it between 50hz and 60hz depending on what your power supply is, and you should be in business."
5,Pretty Cool!!,"I got this alarm clock for both my daughters. They could sleep through a hurricane, but not this alarm!!! Works great."
5,Sonic Boom Alarm Clock,This clock is simple to use and the loudness of the alarm can be adjusted for various hearing conditions. The bed shaker also works well. I use it to travel with because of the sound level. The electric adapter is rather heavy but the clock works very well. It also has a battery backup in case of power outage. I would recommend this product.
3,Where is the snooze button?,"I like everything about the alarm clock except for the buttons and switch. The snooze button is the same button as 4 other buttons in the same area except that this snooze button has a little dot texture on it like a braille. You basically have to wake up to find it and then press it to snooze. Now, this defeats the purpose of having a snooze button if you are already awake looking for it. Also, the ""on"" and ""off"" alarm switch on the side is a little awkward and small for this size alarm clock. I do worry a little that it will break off. The design could be better. For the price that I paid for this, I can live with it."
2,Sonic Boom will wake the neighbors,"I am profoundly deaf, so I cannot use a regular alarm clock. I ordered this one because I needed one that vibrates to wake me up. I am not a super-heavy sleeper, so I just need enough of a nudge to know it is time to wake up in the morning. This clock, however, is made for DEEP sleepers. The first time I experienced the massive shaking, I woke up in a panic. This is such an unpleasant way to wake-up, I often turn the alarm off if I wake up on my own a few minutes before it is set to go off. It does the job, and I know it is there to wake me if I should not wake up on my own, but suddenly I find my own biological clock to be waking me more often than this one. I really should return it and try another one. I simply haven't had the time to do so."
2,It runs slower at 220 volts.,"I travel frequently to Europe and this clock doesn't work too well with 220 volts even with sonic 220 volts power adapter. I also tried using 110 volts adapter with the step-down transformer. The clock runs 10 minutes slower at 220 volts per hour. However, it runs fine at 110 volts. If you travel internationally, don't buy this clock."
3,The jury is still out on this,"The display is actually pretty small, which is disappointing. The numbers measure about an inch in height so if you are looking for a large display to read from across the room, don't purchase this clock. I'm debating on sending it back."
3,Bought it for my sleepy cousin's birthday,my cousin loved it and said it woke him up everytime even though he's a heavy sleeper. But it broke within a year so :T
2,Decent Alarm but too loud for me and my apt building,"This is a decent alarm however but its too loud for me, using the lowest settings and trying to adjust the tone just created a sound that was unpleasant. I tried the bed shaker both under the pillow and under the mattress and its just too loud. In an older wood framed apt building you can hear it going off and will likely aggravate others. I wanted to give this a shot but I guess its more than i need."
3,serves the purpose,"i had a really awful experience a few years ago with this company's alarm clocks and since then i had avoided this particular brand of alarm clocks. however, i am hearing impaired and this company pretty much has a monopoly on suitable alarm clocks. so i decided to give it another try and surprisingly, i have not had any problems yet. i've had the clock for about two months now. the problems i had before were all over the place and basically i had to ship back and forth 3 or 4 alarm clocks and none of them worked, which is why i gave up. but this one seems to be working fine so far."
2,OK product,"The product is loud enough, but there is no way to know whether the alarm is set or not (no light or swith)."
1,Not what I expected.,"The ordering process was fine as usual, too bad the product was a let down. I am deaf on my left side and severely hearing impaired on the right and was looking for a vibrating alarm clock. The vibrating piece works very well. It literally shakes the entire bed. I put it under my mattress by my feet and my husband could feel it. This part is great if that is the only feature you are looking for. I bought (but returned) this clock for its ""tone"" feature, which is completely useless for someone with tone deafness. The manufacturer does not indicate the frequency of its tone, which is by the way, all in the high frequency range, just what I cannot hear, at all. My husband says it was very loud. So if you are hearing impaired to low frequencies or just hearing impaired across all frequency ranges this clock would probably be fine. If you have high frequency loss, don't bother unless you only want the 'shake' feature. Hope this helps fellow hearing impaired friends."
5,Sonic Boom Alarm Clock,"I love the Sonic Boom Alarm Clock. It is exactly what you said it would be, with a good loud alarm and the vibration can easily be felt through the mattress. Thank you. Cheri B"
3,for the heavy sleepers??,"I purchased this alarm clock as a last resort. I was so sick of being late for work, I researched and found this one. I liked that it had the vibrating disk to place under the pillow and how loud it was supposed to go. I thought that you would have to be a mummy to sleep thru this since it is made for the hearing impaired. Well I guess I really do go into a coma. I still have issues getting up. I set this along with my other alarm clock and two cell phones. I guess you could say that I need a little more help than this can give me."
3,"Works as advertised, but durability is terrible","Sonic Boom Alarm ClockThis alarm clock works as advertised. I am in college, and missed a few early morning quizzes because my cell phone alarm and clock radio were not sufficient to wake me up after a short sleep and late night of studying. I bought this hoping to remedy the problem. At first, it worked great. I used only the vibrating function, as the siren is more than obnoxious and my roommates would not appreciate it. All was well until I discovered this morning, after failing to wake up for class, that the vibrating pod had ceased to function. Not cool.A replacement vibrator pod costs 32 dollars, so my options are apparently limited to sending it to the company headquarters in Michigan for repair. That's pretty ridiculous after only two months of use."
1,Won't keep accurate time,"I've owned this clock for more than a year. The vibrator and alarm work well, but the clock won't keep time accurately - gains six minutes a day. Too bad, other features are ok, but it's supposed to keep TIME! Notice several other buyers have complained about the inaccurate clock. Wish a quality manufacturer made a similar product."
1,What a disappointment!!!!,The first one I received did not keep correct time. I returned it and asked for a replacement. The second one the snooze button didn't work. When you pushed snooze it turned the alarm off. Not a reliable product.
4,Sonic Boom Alarm Clock,I am hearing impaired and normal alarm clocks don't wake me up. This one does. So far this clock has been very good. The vibrate mode wakes me right away. I tried it under my pillow at first and it was intense so I moved it under my mattress and it was very effective. At this point in time I would definently recommend it.
3,"Loud, but apparently not loud enough... (heavy sigh)","This alarm clock is loud and obnoxious as advertised. Amazingly, my 13 year old woke up to it 4 out 5 days the first week, twice the next, and hasn't since. This is more a problem with him than it is the clock, but I was very hopeful that it would solve my problems getting him out of bed. Maybe I can rig up a car horn. Oh well."
4,Great Alarm for an Early Riser,"I live in New York and have a long subway commute each morning. To be at work on time at 8:00 AM, I have to arise at 5:45 to shower, dress, etc. Getting to bed sometimes late the evening before has plagued me with late risings. I can easily sleep through a ""normal"" or even my usually reliable blackberry alarm. But there is no sleeping through the Sonic Boom. My roommate (who rises much later) was displeased initially by the volume I selected which was much too high. The bed shaker is also highly effective and can be used to easily wake me up by itself without the tone. My only complaint is that it is at time too easy to deactivate the alarm 'til the next day on a particularly groggy morning. I love this alarm!"
5,"It vibrates, it's loud, and it's really, really annoying - yup, IT WORKS!","I have been using this for about a month now. I love it. I just got a new job and I have to wake up 3 hours earlier than my previous job. It's a pain to wake up. This alarm clock does the job. The alarm sound is LOUD and ANNOYING. The snooze button is super small so you can't just hit it with your fist like most alarm clocks and fall back asleep. You will wake up to it. It's also VERY easy to set up. It's light and compact enough to take it with you on your travels. I highly recommend it. After all the price is right, too.Updated review: I wrote the above review Jan 2008. It is now Feb 2011, 3 years later...we are still using this alarm clock! We ended up buying a 2nd one (my husband and I wake up at different times). We love this alarm...the only negative thing is that the vibrating attachment stopped working within 6-9 months after purchasing the devices."
5,just plain works,"My 13 year old would often not make it for her school bus in the morning as she would sleep through her ""standard"" alarm clock. With malicious glee I purchased this alarm and it works really well. For the month or so we have had it she has not failed to wake up once. It is set to vibrate mode so I can't evaluate the buzz mode (which is apparently frighteningly loud), and it shakes her whole bed without waking up the rest of the household. This has saved me a lot of grief in the morning and she has yet to sleep through the intense vibration elicited by this alarm clock. The vibrate device is placed under her mattress and vibrate the whole bed...not violently, just effectively."
5,great clock,this is the best clock ever - my son can't get up with any clock but this one really works. I would recommend this product for any heavy sleeper.
5,On time Everytime,Recomend this to anyone loosing thier hearing. Or if you only dont want to disturb others. The new clock is very sleek & fits nicley on my nightstand. Also look into the travel version not much bigger than a compact & works very well. Have not been late for work since I bought them!
2,Cheaply Made,This product is good theoretically but in reality is a piece of crap. Cheaply put together so that the cord would easily fall off.
2,it's loud....,"My 17 yr old can ignore just about anything and this is no exception. But, it finally gets to him after about 10 mins. Unfortunately by that time, everyone in the house is up.If you are looking for a loud alarm, this is your clock. Even the vibration device is loud. For the really heavy sleeper, it works better than other things I have tried. Now if only someone could make an alarm clock that would sprinkle the sleeper with ice water, that might get my son going....."
3,Be Careful Not a Dual Alarm Clock,I did a search for Dual Alarm Clocks and Amazon presented this item at the top of list.The description say dual time.This means 12/24 hour not dual alarms.I fault Amazon for this more so than the maker.Next time I will use more diligence in my investigation of a product.
3,Not much louder than what I have and cheaply made,"for the price I would expect it to be a little better made. if it wasnt for the vibrating disc, I would say this would be worth 10.00. it is loud, but not much louder than most alarm clocks I've had. But I will keep it and see it the vibrating disc wakes me up enough to make me get up"
5,it really works,this product was great. my mother is deaf. she could not hear the average alarm clock. when we put this alarm clock in her bedroom and set the alarm she was awakened at the set time. she could hear it. I would recommend it to anyone who has a difficult time hearing a normal alarm clock.
2,Disappointing,"I was looking for a vibrating alarm clock as I have a hearing problem -- this does the basic job of waking me up with its vibration. However, the very large display is very bright even on the lowest setting and so for a dark room I have to cover it over at night. I specifically chose this clock because it also had a battery (as well as AC) hence I assumed it would be good for travelling -- but no, the battery only keeps the settings (apparently), ie. you cannot see the time, nor use the alarm/vibrator when it is running on the battery. The clock itself seems to be made of cheap plastic. I was very disappointed with it and would not recommend it to anyone."
3,Zaman,"This items is really good though, I got a problem with this item.The problem is I tried to use battery but it did not work.Electric power is ok.I tried to contact with amazon but didn't find the contact information so I could not solve the problem.I could change if I wanted but it's a hassle so I kept it.Zaman"
4,Good product but less loud than expected,"It is loud, do not mistake me. But I really wanted a loud loud alarm clock. This from a person who can sleep thru a fire alarm.like setting the snooze time (only the 9 standard minutes) , or having 2 alarms.No problem so far with the time, and it has been about two weeks.It does the job, the vibrating part works perfect under my pillow."
4,Works well; product durability questionable,"It works as is advertised. The vibrator works well, and it definitely lives up to it's name as far as volume is concerned.The cord for the vibrator is delicate, and I don't know how long it will last. I've had it for about 3 months now. Also, some of the buttons require a LOT of pressure on them for them to work - an amount which makes it obvious that it wasn't designed that way. I also wonder if the those buttons will stop working at some point.If it lasts, it is definitely worth the buy."
4,"Nice Vibe, Not Loud","The sound of this alarm is about as loud as any other alarm clock. It gets higher pitched, and lower pitched, so you have a choice on which sound annoys you awake the most, but it isn't all that loud. The vibration of this alarm clock, however, is fantastic! I bought one for my brother for his birthday, and now he's actually ON TIME for school!I'd recommend it for the hearing impaired, and for lazy teenagers."
2,disappointed,"I ordered this alarm clock to help me wake up easier in the morning. i am very disappointed. The clock is not of good quality at all. the buttons are small and don't work very well. i have to pick the clock up and turn the light on to locate the snooze button, usually this button is very large and in the center. the brightness on the clock makes it almost unusable at night, i have to set it face down to drown out the light, even on the dim setting. the vibration does not offer a gentle wakeup in my opinion, it is actually more annoying than the buzz of a normal alarm clock. i do not reccomend this clock at all."
1,SORRY ALARM CLOCK,"We just sent our 18 year old son off to college with what we thought was the perfect alarm clock to get him up for class.Upon plugging in the clock,we saw that the numbers did not all illuminate.Crunched for time,we knew he would just have to deal with it.Within an hour the clock began to gain time,lots of time.Now, he is away at school over three hours away with a USELESS SONIC BOOM ALARM CLOCK AND NO CAR.AWESOME!!!!!!!!!"
5,IT WORKS!!!,We are very happy with this product. It is waking our teenager up every day. Because our teen is waking up our home life is so much better.
2,Loud..but does not work consistently!!,"I bought this clock a couple weeks ago and I had to return it. It worked great the first week or so, it literally scared me out of bed ( I don't know if this is good or not, but I am a notoriously deep sleeper). But then it didnt work consistently. I would have it set for both alarm and vibrator, however, the alarm wouldn't go off, only the vibe did. So, i ended up returning it. Not sure if my clock was just defective, or if all of them are like this, but I would definitely NOT recommend this product."
4,Love it,"I have trouble waking up to music,I sleep right through it. I hate alarms, so this vibrating alarm really works for me. Its powerful too. I love this clock."
2,Totally unreliable...,It sounds great and really loud. The vibrating thingy works perfect. But is totally unreliable because it can keep the hours straight. I dont know why but when i wake up in the morning and i leave to work the clock always has the wrong hour when i back at night. Sometimes it even happens during the night when you are counting for an exact hour to wake up. It gets faster os slower but i just can t keep an hour styraight. I just know that i cant rely on it so i placed it on the box again and threw it away.
4,"BF says it works great, but it's not particularly pleasant","I got this clock as a gift for my boyfriend for his birthday. He was sleeping in too late because he kept hitting snooze without realizing it and not getting up as early as he wanted. He told me that he does wake up a lot better now. However, the noise is kind of annoying (think of the malfunctioning hearing aid screech) so he thinks he'll stop using that part of the alarm since the vibrating part works well. Also, he doesn't particularly like getting ""buzzed"" awake, even though it works very well."
5,The best alarm ever for heavy sleepers!!,"This alarm does the trick if you are a heavy sleeper like i am. I promise you, if you set this up correctly, you will never over sleep for work or an important meeting."
1,Not very effective,"It seems as if around the 6 mos - 1 year mark that these vibrating alarm clocks start failing, and I have to buy yet another one. I am functionally deaf without my hearing aid and I need a vibrating alarm clock to wake me up every day. I'm usually happy with them.I replaced the circle shaped Sonic Boom with the flashing orange light with this one, because this one is more suited for travelling in a suitcase and has a better design. Big mistake. I have tried the vibrator underneath my mattress and right underneath my pillow, with not very good results either way. The vibrator needs to be about ten times more powerful to wake me up on a consistent basis. It has never woken me up at the time I set it at in the time I have had it.Worst vibrating alarm clock I have tried."
2,Not so Sonic,UPS just dropped it off about 10 minutes ago.I configured the time and set an alarm to go off in a minute and set to volume 5 due to a comment saying it was really loud at 8....I thought it be much louder.... I put it to 10 and played with the tones... Really? This is supposed to wake the dead? Maybe I need something thats like 300db ? Hopefully the vibrations along with my cell phone alarm clock and its vibration will start waking me up...
3,Not as loud as I had hoped.,"I'm a very deep sleeper. When I first got this product it was successful in waking me up (lvl 10/10) for about a week before I got used to the alarm sound. It was not as loud as I hoped it would be. The vibration pad, however, is great. I keep it under my pillow and it is usually successful in waking me up."
3,"Cheaply made, but loud","I bought this for my boyfriend, so I haven't personally used it, only tested it out. When I took it out of the box, I was surprised how cheap it was; I can't believe this cost $40! The buttons are tiny and flimsy. The base is unstable. Setting the time up was annoying, pushing ""hour"" and ""time set"" at the same time, to get to the right hour. Same to set the alarm. When I tested the alarm, it was loud, but I expected louder, based on reviews. I cranked it to 8 ( not 10). It also has a dial to change the tone of the sound, and the higher-pitch sounds even louder and more annoying- that will wake up anyone. (EVEN MY DOG WAS ANNOYED). I think it will be effective, but not good quality. Hopefully it will last a while."
1,Doesn't work,It didn't wake me up even when it did go off but now after 2 months it just stopped working. The company has the worst customer service that I have EVER experienced.
4,Alarm,Bought the alarm for my son at college who used to sleep with three alarms and still didn't get up. He says it works great.
4,Good but needs a few more features,"I have a standard Sonic boom and really like it. Bought this model for traveling, since I have severe/profound hearing loss and do not sleep with my CIs. This model works well, but does not have the ""test"" feature of the standard model. It is not a small clock, so you would think it would not be a problem to include this feature. Overall, i highly recommend the Sonic Boom products."
5,I did what I expected,"I decided to go alone to Walt Disney World in order to participate in the January 2010 Marathon Weekend(All three races). I needed to get up at 3 to 3:30 to catch the bus to the start. A wake up call was out of the question. The bed shaker was exactly what I needed. It had me up and out of bed and half dressed before I knew I was awake. One morning while trying to find the ""off"" button the bomb slipped from under my pillow and practically shook the room when It rested against the wooden headboard. Although I never heard from them I am sure the neighbors weren't very happy!During the week it was in use it kept accurate time.The only complaint I have is the size and location of the off button; with continued use how to turn it off is something with which I will become more familiar."
1,OK if you need to get up at 6-ISHHH,"the vibrations work like a rocket, felt my fillings rattle. definitely woke me up (finally). but it was dark, wasn't supposed to be! it gained an hour and a half while i was sleeping! husband joked that within a week it would be back at the right time. we tried a couple of days to make sure it was screwey, and then had to send it back."
5,Sonic boom clock works!,"My father who wears hearing aids has had trouble hearing a morning alarm - this really works for him, if fact it wakes everyone in the house!"
3,I still sleep through it!,"My housemate is deaf, and she recommended this alarm to me. (I'm a hearing person, but an extremely heavy sleeper.) Unfortunately, even with both the sound alarm and the shaker, I can still sleep through it! I have a clock radio set to go off at 7 am, and this alarm set for 7:15. Every morning, both this week and last, I've slept until 8:45 am -- that's a whole hour and a half with the radio going, this alarm shrieking, and the shaker shaking away at my pillow. I have a foam mattress and a foam pillow, which may absorb some of the sound and/or vibration. But my housemate has a regular mattress and pillow, and many mornings in the past when I *have* woken up, I've been able to hear my her alarm coming on, and staying on, and on, and on . . . In other words, if you need an alarm that's absolutely impossible to ignore, this may not be the clock for you."
1,Not so great,"This clock worked wonderful for the first couple of months. Then the time started changing sporadically, and not only by a few minutes, I'm talking HOURS. It's now completely unreliable. Not worth the money."
4,I'm UP ALREADY!!!!,"Hey, I finally found an alarm clock that WORK!!! I'm up at the time I'm suppose to be. WOW!!! Down fall, I had to return the clock because the extensions for the pad and the electrical outlet were too long and just to bothersome. I have two cats and thinking about the possibility of my loves getting tangled in them... just too much for me... chao!"
5,Great for marriages!,"This product is worth every penny! My husband is SUCH a sound sleeper. He would set the alarm to blaring music every morning, but I was the one who had to ""nudge"" (well, maybe sometimes KICK) him to hit the snooze. He likes to have at least thirty minutes of pressing the snooze button before he has to get up. Needless to say I would have trouble getting back to sleep from all this music and kicking and he would get up pretty grumpy himself.The ""vibrating only"" mode of this clock is strong enough to wake him up right away, but yet it is so much more pleasant than loud music or an alarm. I even wake up from the vibrating under his pillow, but when the snooze is pushed it is easy to go back to sleep because the vibration didn't make me irritated or stressed. We wake up together much more pleasant and calm.We both love it!"
5,"Finally, an alarm clock that will wake you up!","My teeneagers could never wake up with a regualr alarm clock. Finally, a clock that not only is extremely loud, but also 'buzzes' your body to alert and almost scare you awake. Definelty worth it! Highly recommended for the hard sleeper."
3,ehh..,"cheap material, not many settings, expensive for what it is. but it does wake you up. could be better for the price"
1,couldn't make it work. i've abandoned it to stop loss,"i bought this product because vendor states it works with 110v/220v. the 220v option requires extra charge, but i forgot to order it.now i've got the product and then asked for the 220v transformer. they passed me to the british representative of the vendor. the british representative found the adapter for 15 EUR in france (acceptable), but freight was 59 EUR (more than the watch, the freight from us (which is 3 times farther), and the 220v transformer together).the british representative above has a representative in israel, which could receive my transformer with one of their regular parcels, to cut of that exaggerated freight, but in the end did not.even to return the watch back to the states would cost me more than it's price the vendor would give back to me.i'll definitely have to look for a product near me.best regards,alex"
5,Actually wakes him up!,"The vibrator works so much better than sound alone to wake up my 15 year old son. He hasn't missed the bus since using this alarm! AMAZING! Suggestion: I wish I bought the cord extension. A few times, he's turned the alarm off & fell back to sleep -- I've reset the alarm so he'd wake up. If I had the cord extension, the clock could be placed across the room so he'd HAVE to get out of bed."
5,"Great for a deep sleeper, and for college.","The Sonic Boom alarm clock has been absolutely amazing for me! I have owned it for just over a year now and am completely satisfied with it. I am an incredibly deep sleeper (I once slept through a smoke alarm going off in my house) and this alarm clock has managed to wake me up. I love the fact that the vibrating attachment can be enabled without an audible alarm sound, which has been great for college. I wanted an alarm that would wake me up while disturbing my roommate as little as possible. While the vibrations are so powerful that they can slightly be heard from the same room, this is much less disturbing for a roommate than a regular alarm clock would be."
3,Loud but not reliable,"Loved this alarm clock when I first got it. I have had it just under 6 months and the thing has stopped working. The numbers go out and when they come back on the time is wrong. While it worked, it was great woke me and my son up which no other alarm clock can do. Will probably try another one and get a warranty on it in case it quits working."
3,"Works great, annoying to change wakeup time","I am able to jump right up after this goes off versus my clock radio that I sleep through. I don't always set it for the same time, and changing the time is kinda annoying but it works. Be sure you turn it off when on a vacation or it will make noise all weekend long. I have come home on a Sunday afternoon and heard the alarm going off from outside my house."
5,Works like a charm,"I bought this alarm for my hard of hearing wife. She was having trouble hearing out regular alarm clock in the mornings latey. I bought this as a Christmas gift. She was eager to try it. We put the vibrating piece under the mattress on her side and set it up for a test run. Works beautiful. Shakes enough that you can't sleep through it and I can hear it vibrate.After using it for over a month, I must admit, its actually much more pieceful waking up to thatn our old buzzing alaram or the radio. This alarm does have a buzzer feature that gets VERY loud and has adjustable tones. We don't use that feature. We don't need to with the vibrator attachment.I would definately recommend this for someone with hearing loss or heavy sleepers as well as someone that needs an alarm but doesn't want to wake up their partner/spouse every morning too.Great product - so far so good!"
4,wakes you up,"i was looking for a alarm clock that should actually wakes me up this one is a perfect fit, it will viberat and ring there is no way i can stay asleep, the reason for 4 stars is cause the box was crushed"
4,Good alarm,Very good alarm. I am surprised to see so many buttons. I wish it is little simpler. It works great!
2,Works great ... until it fails unexpectedly.,"While the controls could be a little easier to use, I was thrilled with how well this clock worked. Then the display went bad in less than 6 months of use - making it worthless! Compared to my old clock radio that has been treated poorly over the years and still works, the Sonic Boom had a pretty easy life. I don't understand how the build quality could be so poor.Because I need a solution that wakes me reliably, which it initially did, I'm going to give Sonic Boom one more chance."
1,Shaker Alarm is Broken,"I bought one of these alarm clocks 4 years ago and was disappointed with the quality. The shaker part of that clock broke after just a few months. I really needed a vibrating alarm, so after reading all the recent reviews, I decided to take another chance on this clock. After just over 2 months, the vibrating portion of the alarm has stopped working. I am past my return window with Amazon, so I am apparently stuck with this clock. When it does work, the clock is great. The problem is that the vibrating portion of the clock is not dependable, and without that the clock is worthless to me. I would pass on this clock and look for something with better quality."
5,Perfect,The vibration alert is the best! Wakes me right up and I don't even have to use the beeper. I put mine under the fitted sheet in the corner of the bed.
3,Great clock BUT it only has a 2 year life (1 year wnty),"I wouldn't have a job if I didn't own this clock- seriously! I bought the first model 5 years ago and felt like I got my use out of it once it began to ""die.""So, after purchasing this one I was happy to find the alarm is just as loud & shakey.The only thing I would change: The snooze button is the same size as the off button. Not very conveinent for sleepy hands. The buttons are on opposite ends of the face, but still, it's easy to mix them up if you're a snoozer.I like that this new model is smaller and sleeker- I love it. :)****UPDATE***Seriously, please improve the life of this clock or adjust the warranty. I'm about to purchase my 3rd clock in 4 years. I keep buying because I know it works, but hate the price considering how long it lasts."
2,It an almost ok product,"So on the basis that it shakes to wake you up this product gets 4stars. Every where else it gets 2stars. This is a basic alarm clock. You get a snooze, an alarm and a clock and that's it. The shaking is best described as violent, think your cell phone super-sized and on steroids. I got this so I could wake up and not wake my wife up in the process. This think shakes our queen sized bed enough to wake us both up. She's actually had me go back to using the vibrate alarm on my cell phone.The actual clock feels cheap when you hold it but I haven't had any craftsmanship issues. The 9v battery back up on mine also doesn't work."
1,Annoying for everyone but me,I bought this alarm based upon the reviews by everyone else. It worked for the first couple weeks and now I just sleep through this too. I am an exceptionally heavy sleeper and am still searching for something that will wake me up. I have it set to 10 and put the disc right under where my head is and I still sleep for over a half an hour with it on.
3,Not our final answer,"This is loud - it vibrates the bed - you can hear it from the other side of the house - yet it still doesn't wake up my 17 yr. old son most days. It can go off for 30-60 min. before he hears it. I think we need automatic, flashing lights to go along with the clock."
1,not worth it,I bought this alarm clock in the hope of it being able to wake a very sleepy teenager in the morning. Unfortunately it does not do the job :(
5,Unimportant,"I can't understand why the presentation of this item omits the relevant fact of who wrote the libretto. The text is by Gertrude Stein. Virgil Thompson asked Gertrude Stein for an opera, and she wrote the text."
3,Beware!,"You might already own this book, under the title ""The Vanishing Tower"" - it's generally considered to be the 4th Elric novel in the series.."
4,Nice followup,"This book is a solid followup to their first edition. What I like about it is its breadth. It covers several topics (CVS, PHP, XML, CORBA, MySQL/Postgresql ) that would often have a whole book devoted to them. This book targets the developer who just needs a concise primer on the given topics, and doesn't have the time to read 1000 pages of fluff on every topic in the book.I only gave it four stars, because I felt that ""Beginning Linux Programming"" was more essential than this book. However, this is a very strong book and some of the topics here are not covered elsewhere ( for example, ORBit ). And there's certainly no other book that covers *all* the topics this book covers.Get this, but get ""Beginning Linux Programming"" first."
1,She dont sound black!,"Her older stuff kinda worked b/c it was a variety of styles. This dont work becuase she aint black. Her father aint even fully black--he was half-venezualen. Its Like That Yall?! Since when did Mariah use the word YALL? We Belong Togerther is aiight, but the rest of this CD is pure crap. Youd think Mariah would realize her career has ended after the laughable CHARMBRACELET, but she didnt. Dont even get me started on her wardrobe. Like her wardrobe this album is wack. Thumbs DOWN! its like that bad yall!"
1,Human No-Talent Trash Dog Whistle,Mariah is a guest star on her own album. She pimps every rapper she could in order to make a hit. She doesn't have any true musical talent and that's why she had to downsize her last tour to the size of grocery stores.
3,The Voice: Faith Evans,"If you want to hear ""The Voice"" minus the rappers check out Faith Evans - First Lady. Your ears should be pleased."
1,This Record stinks,and i can't believe anybody cares about this caterwauling cow anymore. Get a life.
1,"Is it not time for Mariah to get over herself, already?","I remember when Mariah had a good voice. I remember when Mariah wasn't a cash-in and when she cared about her fans. I remember when Mariah used to be a good POP artist without annoying rapping guests. Oh yeah, I remember. And you crazy fans do too. I'm not going to bother going on about whether Madonna or Mariah is better, because every true person out there knows who's sold more records and is a better and true artist to their fans (and it's not Mariah. Seriously. Go on Wikipedia on the best selling artists document and you'll see Madonna is number four; Mariah number seven.) Futhermore, Mariah is just going really bland now. I know she still has a great voice, though... Time to put it to good use for once in almost eleven year."
2,pretty disappointed :(,"I wanted to embrace M.C.'s comeback more than anybody, but I was SUPER disappointed in this. The lyrics are dumbed down for the J-Lo demographic (I'm guessing). Not to mention she holds back a lot on her talent. She whispers and shreaks entirely too much. No to mention some sorry ass collabos.Only two good tracks...those are the singles that were released. Don't waste you're money on this one."
3,MUCH BETTER MARIAH,"well it's far from her best, but a vast improvement on her last few albums. For me, mariah will always be a fav of mine, coz of songs like one sweet day, hero and always be my baby etc..This album is pretty good, and i recommend it to all rnb fanz. Mariah is definately improving since glitter so i hope the trend continues and i look forward to the next one. Well done Mimi!"
3,MiMi's Not Fully Emancipated,"I am in between with this one...Mariah is great, but has tendencies to make dumb songs. Most artists would sell their souls to have a voice like Mariah's, yet she wastes on silly butterfly and unicorn filled songs. The only track on this album with any substance is ""We Belong Together"". It's the only song that sounds real, the rest of the CD is jumbled mess; for example, what is the point of the song with Nelly? The lyrics are a joke! I am from Missouri, so I usually rep. Nelly, but not today. I was hoping that she would emancipate her voice from the dumb songs of past albums, but her voice is still being held captive underneath all the glitter, blonde extensions and butterfly mood rings."
1,The Emancipation Of MoooooMooooo...,"I wish I could give the album less than a star, I mean YUCK, all the songs sounds the same, all I can hear is ""Mooo Mooo"" she's mooing like a cow, are you even serious about reading the reviews of her? (she even call herself MIMI now like she's 8 years old), what the hell is she thinking? does she still believe that she can beat Madonna? I DON'T THINK SO.. Hey Mariah, Kill yourself, maybe you'll be popular this way."
1,What was she thinking,There's only one good song on this album! She use to be so good but now her ablums are starting to be very bad! I really wish i didn't buy this album.
1,Mariah sold out,"After having rediscovered Mariah's earlier CDs and enjoying them, I decided to give the new one a go. I couldn't make it through the first time I tried, but forced myself to listen all the way through tonight. Tuneless, hip-hop, subwoofer (today's greatest noise pollution curse) thumping, urban, boring, (did I say tuneless?)chord (if there truly are chords) repetitive crap. I don't think Mimi was emancipated, but sucked into what's currently popular and trapped there. I think all of you who sang the praises of this album owe me my money back."
3,Decent Album!,"I liked the singles that came off of this album. They were strong had great clubs beats and really good vocals. We belong together was a beatufial ballad.I thought shake it off was a great club song. It seems like this sound is alot more different then in all of her albums. It's really got some great production on it. While, this is not my favorite album from hers, i think she did an excellent job of making a great comeback, because she was about to be a has been like Janet. My favorite track is shake it off. Mariah just made some great music. I think she's made alot better sutff then this it was just the right time at the right place for her to be popular again."
3,"Emancipation For Mimi, Vocal Jail For Mariah","The album at best is the closet thing to perfection since let me see: Glitter, Rainbow, & Charmbracelet. Three duds in a row seems like bad karma to me. The songs on Emancipation is worth a listen to. Her voice is on the verge of being whispery and cracked up. That whispery voice of hers is not the Mariah that I grew up to love. Dressing like a hoochie is not good for the pipes. Dressing up in the middle of January in a hoochie dress caused her to lose some of the vocal power that we have come to know and distinguish from other female singers. What Miss Girl needs to do is go on a vocal sabbatical to regain some of her vocal power. Now, as far as the hip hop beats go, she needs to go back to what she knows best: straight up r&b. Listening to hip hop is one thing: but singing it is not for her. Give it up! The album is good, but could be better!"
2,Desperate for a hit album!,"Poor Mariah, where has the talent gone? I had high hopes for this cd after the unfair treatment that was ""glitter"" and the mellow though consistent ""charmbracelet"". ""mimi"" is nothing more than a desperate attempt to relive the glory days of a once blossomed career. Why is every song ruined by guest rappers and hip hop? (to the floor,its like that).where is the vocals? where is the stand out uniqueness of earlier Mariah gems...""butterfly"" ""daydream"" etc. Mariah's desperate attempt to have ""street cred"" (circles,stay the night)has over shadowed all of the songs on here. This is a horrid cd that is over produced (joyride)and way too calculated(mine again) Pity cause Mariah was once a real talent. May i suggest an accapella record next time...just ""the voice"" and instruments would be nice...leave the rappers at home! A shame! D-"
2,Disappointed,"I am very disappointed in this album. As well as the last few albums. The last Mariah Carey album that I really enjoyed was ""Butterfly."" There was really only one song on this album that I enjoyed. That is ""Fly Like a Bird."" However, I have always been a Mariah Carey fan and I will continue to support her music.Sincerely,Rosey"
1,"AFTER ONE LISTEN, I'M EMANCIPATING MY EARDRUMS!","I just cannot believe the raves I'm reading here for Beyonce's-new-lookalike Mariah's ""comeback, return to greatness, etc.""I ran out to buy this after reading some of these reviews andI am VERY disppointed. Where are the melodies? It's all boringhip-hop beats, with Mariah doing her vocal doodles over therhythm. There isn't one song that grabs you, not even the ballads. When I think of how great she was back in the day of ""Music Box"", ""MTV Unplugged"", ""Butterfly"" , etc. I feel like I'll probably never like anything she does from now on. She's trying too hard to be ""current"" instead of just doing what she used to do best, SINGING A REAL SONG. If you're a fan of the ""Classic Mariah"" I would urge you to listen to the soundclips on Amazon before plunking down your hard earned money. Sorry Mimi, you let me down!"
1,Hype and circumstance,"It amazed me when I heard that this CD debuted at #1 on Billboard. They must be doing the same thing they did several years ago -- priced the record extremely low and have people from the record company go out and buy copies to give the impression that its big. Mariah has a great voice, but she needs to stick with her early 90's formula -- pop/R&B. She sounds foolish trying to be hip-hop. She's a product and the record industry will keep shoving her down our throats ... and most will eat it up, unfortunately."
3,"Nice, But HIGHLY OVER-RATED","True Enough Mariah can sing(Not Nearly as good as she used to) but compared to most current singers she can but this album was not the ""Major Come back"" or album of 2005 as they try to make it out to be. It was highly anticipated which spiked the sales because everyone wanted to hear what Mariah had to say and think about it..who came out in 2005 that put out a solid product that could compete with the likes of Mariah Carey. Its a good cd i give her that, but in my opinion was one of the most over-rated cds of 2005"
3,Hot Dog!,"I agree with prior review - Mariah is bomb diggity. In fact, I'd go as far as to say she's hot diggity, dog diggity, boom what you do to me.But bombs, dogs, and diggitys aside, this album proves once again, Mariah should be covered in ketchup, mustard, and onions and served on a fresh bun.I also agree with above reviewer. Mariah has laid waste to the competition for years - UNtreated, human waste, that is.14 stars."
1,mariah officially lost it,i used to be a mariah fan. i still am in fact. i like all her old stuff.but this??...this? u've got to be kiddin me. this is just like any other crap that u hear on the radios these days. i am VERYdisappointed
1,Both Mariah and Madonna Are No Talent Hacks,"Why all the Madonna vs. Miriah Carey talk here? Look folks, neither one has any talent and has coasted on year of PR hype. Both of their performances Grammy night were an embarrassment to music and it is amazing that anyone thinks otherwise. You know its true, so just admit it. Both simply peddle music as product and steal right and left from other artists because they haven't ever been able to make music that even approaches originality. The sooner the public forgets about these two hack the better off music and the entire world will be."
3,Prefer the old Mariah,"My favourite song on the album is Mine Again because it really showcases her voice. I am a very big fan favourite of her 90's albums. Mariah has an extraordinary talent, but I feel her best work is still behind her. That's when she really showed us all what she could do with her voice. Did you know she can sing 8 octaves, making her voice sound like a whistle? Come on Mariah! Show us what you've got!"
5,Refreshing,"Judging by the majority of these reviews, it's reassuring to know that America still believes in good singing and genuine talent. Mariah has always been there when we needed her the most. She's one of the most consistent recording artists of our time. The music industry really needs this right now. Music sales are depressed and there's not a whole lot to look forward to on the immediate release schedule. A few items here and there. This CD has given me hope that brighter things are on the horizon. It took a lot of courage for Mariah to put her game face back on and head into the studio. And like a real pro, she came back with an very likeable record. GREAT JOB!!!"
5,"Good album! Features my favorite ""Mariah"" track-","And it's not ""We Belong Together"" even though for most this song defines where she is now musically. Personally I felt ""Its Like That"" was her best work so far (yes...over her ballads which made her a vocal force to be reckoned with). The lyrics are clever, tongue-in-cheek, fun and you can tell she had fun just to sing it. The song also changes at certain points with good results like when she goes: ""It's my night. No stress. No fights.""- she starts to harmonize with the piano playing in the background (showing her classy side) and then goes back into the chorus featuring the club-banging beats. And the fact that it was the first single from this album showed how much faith Mariah had in the song. The whole album is good. Especially with consistent quality on tracks like ""Stay the Night"", ""Shake it Off"", ""Mine Again"", Mariah displays her abilities to still make catchy good mainstream music. Oh and it's also her best produced album since ""Butterfly""."
1,I miss the old Mariah,Tom Matola knew how to market this woman. This album is just a snooze fest. It gets returned first thing in the morning.
5,Welcome Back Mimi!,"This CD is great! Such classic tracks! Here songs are enjoyable to listen to. The first time I heard the entire track, I was ready to purchase my own. I highly recommend!"
1,Should be less than one star,"Really, there is nothing to this cd. nothing creative about it or original. your crazy if you think this is a come back"
4,"good, but disappointing","This is not your average cd. That much is certain. Mariah has a powerful voice, and it shows. The songs on this cd are all very good, but the cd in general is somewhat disappointing. I really wanted to hear more of her voice, which can be very powerful but, in many songs, is shadowed. I have many of her previous cds, many of which are very good and possibly better than this one, but, all in all, this cd is a good one."
2,Superficial,"She used to have a good voice, but now shes all about the money. I don't see it, I even liked her album ""Glitter"" better than this and IMO it's gone downhill from there. She needs to get her act together, she's riding on the teen croud now and has pretty much lost all of her traditional fans."
1,Time to give it up,My head is pounding after giving this album a spin. All Mariah does is scream at you through the speakers. My roomate stormed into my room and demanded that I turn that garbage down. I did her one better and returned it to the store.
1,DONT BUY IT! I REPEAT DONT BUY THIS ONE!,"This was a good album but wait until November 15 to buy the re-release with 4 extra songs, and 4 music videos!"
2,Another artist not giving a damn about the fans...,"I love this album. What I don't love is the fact that she is re-releasing it on November 15 with four new tracks, including the new single ""Don't Forget About Us."" Way to go, Mariah. Great way to thank the 3.5 million fans who contributed to your comeback... to make us all go out and buy it again. I hope everyone goes out on that day and buys Madonna's new album instead."
1,Ewwwwwww!,"This album is just awful. If I wanted to hear someone scream for an hour I would just move back in with my mom. Get her Christmas album instead, or Madonnas latest which is AMAZING."
5,Not bad for 23 years!,"Madonna's Confessions on the Dance Floor is #1 in the US and in Europe. Hung up is #7 on the Billboard charts and #1 practicly everywhere else. Need I so more! What! Mariah, yeah what about her?"
4,She is back,"She is definately back with the voice! I have to say that I have really enjoyed listening to this album. The only problem for me are the tracks with Nelly and Shake It Off but the rest is great. Who knows these songs might grown on me.My favourites are Stay The Night, We Belong Together, Fly Like A Bird, I Wish You Knew.I would recommend this CD."
5,MIMI ROCKS!,"After getting this album, I'd like to 'Say Somethin''. If you are after great music, great voice and great enjoyment, stop running around in 'Circles', the 'One And Only' Mariah (aka Mimi) is 'Your Girl'. To all old/new/ex-Mimi fans out there, 'I wish You Knew' that 'We Belong Together'. Don't you like the 'Joy Ride' she takes us through her albums? 'It's Like That', her music makes us 'Fly Like A Bird'. We rush 'To The Floor' and dance. When we get sad, we 'Shake It Off' by listening to her music. When our bf / gf refuses to 'Stay The Night', her music will. Is she your star, she is definitely 'Mine Again'. 'Get Your Number' One album now!"
4,A GREAT CD![...].....BUT![...],"THIS IS A GREAT CD.I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO MARIAH CAREY FOR OVER A DECADE NOW.BUT IN ALL TRUTH HER #1'S CD IS THE ONLY ONE YOU WILL EVER NEED!AND HER 2 DISC REMIX SET ARE GREAT REMIX'S OF HER #1 HIT'S.MARIAH CAREY WILL ""ALWAYS BE A LENGEND OF THE 90'S""JUST LIKE MADONNA IS A LEGEND OF THE 80'SWHO WILL BE THE LEGEND FOR 2000+ ????[...]"
1,Time to retire Mariah,"Mariah needs to enjoy the success of this album after her last string of flops, cause once people discover how bad this album is they will never be dupped into buying a record from her again. Pushing 40 and she offers nothing new with this record. She also has nothing profound to say! Does this woman ever have an opinion? I really dont know why this album is selling but I guess when you have 10 different versions for sale, its not that hard. Its pure greed if you ask me. Dont waste your money on this"
1,The Constipation Of Mimi,"I was FORCED to listen to this cd on a trip with a hoochie mama. Why oh why does Mariah have to sing the scales on EVERY song?? Finally after several plays we stoped at a gas station and when the hootchie went to get some fried pork rinds, I tossed this TRASH cd along the 101."
3,Not her best but Good,"Ok this album I bought over the single"" It's Like That"" a good single that wants you to get up and dance. Then the overplayed single ""WE Belond Together"" is now at #1 for it's fifth week. It took me awhile to get use to this album I do like the song"" Shake it off"" and "" Say Somehtin"" but thats about it She can do better than this and I believe in her ability to do better than what this album is."
4,SOLID! A GREAT COME BACK. WILL SHE GET HER FANS BACK?,"One of the things I've always loved about Mariah is that she always delivers a compilation of good songs. I wish she would pay more attention to the way she dresses these days. For the past 6 years, she's been dressing like a hoochie. Her look is the hoochie type but her songs are not.This is a great album which I honestly favor over her last release which was CHARMBRACELET. My favorite Mariah album would be RAINBOW which was released in 1999.Overall, this is a good album and I recommend purchase."
3,The Emancipation of Mimi ~Mariah Carey,"The emancipation of Mimi by Mariah Carey is one of the best albums that she has ever made. Her new pop cd is a sure comeback. This new album does make the statement that Mariah Carey is one of the best female artist of our times. Her album is a combination of upbeat songs and also emotional slow songs. She comes together with some of the top rappers such as snoop dog and nelly and twista. Mariah Carey new songs are already hitting the air ways such as We Belong Together, Shake It Off, and It's Like That. Mariah Carey's new album is going to bring her back to the charts and all over the air ways."
1,Please.....,"This is a new take on a very old, tired sound. All of her songs are starting to sound alike. I used to be a fan, but apparently she has run out of ideas. Skip this cd."
1,Unbelieveable.....,"This is garbage....what is wrong with the world today. I have never heard a worse CD in my life. Mariah needs to retire or make porn, not music. Any person with good taste in music would rather lop off thier fingers one by one, then listen to this trash. This is the equivalent of Mariah Carey taking a poop and recording it to cd.DO NOT BUY"
5,Mariah Carey back!,"Im not big on R&B, but i can't stop listening to this album. I really dig it from beginning to end. Im glad she didnt disappoint us this time around. Get this album........its really all that."
3,Split personality.,"The problem with this album is that Mariah switches from hip hop Mariah that they play on urban and mainstream radio stations to pop Mariah that they play on soft rock stations. It sounds like every other song, the kid is switching the radio to their favorite station and then their mom changes it back.On both identities, MiMi has some hits and misses. On songs like ""Stay the Night"", ""We Belong Together"" and ""Shake It Off"", we find some of Mariah's best hip hop-esque songs yet. But then there are tracks like ""Say Somethin'"", ""To The Floor"" and ""It's Like That"" that are just laughable.Same with her other, more adult music side. ""Mine Again"" and ""Circles"" are great. But then comes ""I Wish You Knew"" (They try to make it sound like she sang this live, which is even more annoying.) and ""Joy Ride"" to ruin it.But when she puts the two together on tracks like ""Your Girl"" and ""Fly Like A Bird"", it is perfection."
1,Skip it,Huge Mariah fan that wanted to love this CD. After hearing this I mine as well have listened to her last few albums because it all sounds the same!!!! I think I am going to get into Madonna. At least she takes her fans on a wild new creative ride with each album.
1,.,"Mariah really needs to stop cashing-in on people.At first, I liked this album but since she's released the platinum edition (the FOURTH release of this album) and became a pre-madonna beyatch, i havent liked her.I wish people would see her for who she is. She just wants to make money, other wise she would've NOT released the platinum edition. Still, that's made me hate this too.don't buy it---BUY MADONNA'S ALBUM INSTEAD!even Carrie Underwood is better than this trite!"
2,OMG This Is OVERRATED,"I dont understand why her last albums were flops but this was a hit. I dont understand why We Belong Togther is so popular. The song spent over 10 weeks at #1 breaking almost every #1 single she has released. Someone please fill me in. The song is about as average as it can get. We are talking about a typical Jermaine Dupri production, something we hear everyday in today's music. I didnt care for her 1st single and the 3rd single is boring with another typical JD production. I swear this has to be the most overrated album all year. I dont hear anything on here for me to run out and waste money on. Her ballads are oversung and boring as ever. Mariah had a breakdown, whinned and cried about being on top, well congratulations you are here once again."
2,gets annoyinh,"at first it sounds interesting, but after it gets really annoying, because her voice is too high and it penetrates into my ear drums and gives me a migrane"
5,welcome the voice back,now im the boy that said you sound like a dog jho but on mimi's album i gotta say you sound like a hummin beautiful bird because she does you got alot of party tracks but you still got some ballads and that's like the ultimate package so you have to go cop that
3,Good album but I was expecting more,"Don't get me wrong. I LOVE Mariah Carey and had great expectations for her latest CD, as according to her it was going to be a liberating album, fun and exciting. I was expecting more of a dance album. Or at least songs with more melodic tones as in her earlier albums be them ballads and/or dance/hip-hop. Mariah has always had THE VOICE. Now I want her to do an album that is reminiscent of her earlier work that really showcases her voice but also is new, fresh and exciting."
1,if only i didnt have to rate,"relax folks i loove! mariah but this cd is bulls#@! what the heck! was def jam and ms.carey herself thinking other than $$$$$$ this is the 1st true filler album she has done glitter,rainbow etc.. were all better and more honest than this sh&! you'll lier's that refuse to tell the truth when you love someone suck she need's to take a long break regroup and make MUSIC again i'm sorry mimi but somebody had to say something real 'cuse this don't make NO dam! sense. and yes i did NOt buy the cd and will not. smooches,x0x0"
1,MIMI,Okay so there is one great song on this album but honestly there is a lot of hype over the entire album. It honestly sounds as if it was produced very fast and just given great PR to promote it. I can not deny that she has a great voice however the fact of the matter is that the production of the songs for the most part are very boring. She was great during her first and second albums. Im sorry I purchased this based on the hype. :(
1,MC stands for Miss Copycat,"Riding on the coattails of Beyonce's success, this opportunist has copied Beyonce's signature look right down to the very hue of her skin complexion. Man, what a good photo-editing software can't do these days.Also to be noted is the shift from the one-word project titles. Following in the lines of Rainbow, Glitter, and Charmbracelet, this one should rightfully have been called Trash. Though escaping it's pre-determined title, the content certainly lived up to it.The songs are lyrically ill-fated, predictable, and melodically weak. Looking at this singer's (and I use the term loosely)tracking record, this album should fizzle out all together within a month or so. Then there will be the imminent dry-spell period lasting 5-6 years of which there will be numerous flops and failures. But fear not; with the advent of the new Beyonce, she will also ride in the afterglow of this new ""it"" girl's success, but at 43 years of age it will prove a tad difficult to pull off."
3,Definitely not the Mariah of the early 90's,"This newest CD isn't the greatest, but I think it is much better than Chambracelet. My favorite Mariah albums are still Emotions and Butterfly."
1,Washed-Up Has Been,"Mariah was good in her prime. Soon, she started to become ""black"" when she is more white than a ghost. On this album, she lines herself up with every rapper in the universe and still manages to sing off-key and sing bad lyrics. ""We Belong Together"" is the only good song on this album. To all the ""lambs"" out there: sorry! Going to J-Lo's or Madonna's forums to post bad stuff can't take away from Mariah's downfall."
4,MiMi On Top Again,Mariah Carey is back but not for the best. Don't get me wrong I like Mariah Carey and she's one of the better artists out right now but all her singles have been nothing groundbreaking. If not for We Belong Together I seriously dont think Mariah Carey would be anymore popular then she was when she dropped her lead single. It's good to see Mariah on top again but I'd wish she would've recorded quality work instead of some average overproduced redundant Hip-Hop junk to remain relevant with today's atrocious music.
3,A decent album...,"I decided to give this album a three star rating because there are only three songs that struck me as being particularly fun or interesting. I enjoyed ""We Belong Together,"" ""Get Your Number,"" and ""It's Like That"" from the album. The rest of the songs fell short of what I'd hoped for (and believe me I REALLY wanted to like this CD).This album has been called ""the return of the voice."" I don't know if I'd go that far! This is, at best, a mediocre effort from a woman with much more talent than her recent work would shows. I fear that Mariah may never recapture the magic of her 90s albums."
2,Can I get a melody?,"This has got to be the most derivative stuff I have ever heard pass for a ""great album"".There is not a single memorable melody on the album. And she needs to leave the hip-hop singing style on the shelf. The unison line with the high hat thing is for kids and people with no singing talent.Who mixed this down? The piano and keys are buried in the mix. Maybe there are melodies, they just buried them in the mix.The young Michael Jackson thing is right on. Exactly what she sounds like."
5,"""MIMI"" DELIVERS THE GOODS","Let me start out by saying is that all you have to do is listen to Mine Again, Joyride and We Belong Together to know that THE VOICE is still here alive and well.Besides from that people want an album that they can feel and The Emancipation is a great example of that..The uptempo songs Get Your Number and It's Like That, Shake It Off and One and Only in my opinion are some of Mariah's best and feature hot hot beats.."
4,Better Than Before,"THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI is probably one of the better cds that Mariah Carey made. She really came back, after being idle for so long in the pop culture world. She shows a lot of passion in her work, she has a lot of great upbeat songs, but also has a lot of emotional issues in her songs. She teamed up with some big rappers like Snoop Dog, Nelly and Twista. This has given her a new step in the music world, and I think it's going to bring her up on the charts again. ""We Belong Together"", ""It's Like That"" and ""Shake It Off"" are some of the bigger songs on the CD."
5,"sweet, glamourous and funky",these elements are what makes mariah carey one of the best artists of today and this CD just reconfirms it. Those who ooohed and aahhhed over her butterfly comeback album will have the same experience when they listen to mimi and will want to feel like partying to the dance jams and relaxing to the ballads and r&b numbers in which her vocal talent shines.
4,Set us free Mariah,"Mariah Carey has reigned supreme as pop music's No. 1 diva (one upping Whitney and Celine by writing most of her own material) and it's easy to see why: the girl can sing. Not only sing, but sing with a voice more powerful than any -male or female- in the business today. Here, on her comeback effort entitled The Emancipation of Mimi, she overall succeeds to standing applause but loses some points for the overusage of rap and hip-hop artist collaborations. She sounds her best on songs she and only another writer co-wrote as opposed to mixes featuring the likes of Nelly, Twista and Snoop Dog, songs like ""Mine Again"" and ""Circles."" Tunes like that let her show her amazing five-octave voice to full effect; listen to first single and opening track ""It's Like That"" and you could think she's any female R&B singer. Emancipation truly has set Mariah free, and on this record she can make any listener do so too. Great job."
3,What's this crap?,I bought this cd when it first came out and I find it totally messed up that she came out w/ the Ultra whatever it is. I only like the first 3 songs on this cd. Which sucks the new Ultra whatever has the better newer songs. I was already disappointed when I bought this cd. Can I trade someone this one for the Ultra cd? I grew up loving her so she gets a higher rating.
5,Best album of 2005.,"This is, so far, the best album to be released this year. it is pure r&b; top to bottom.stand-out tracks are:2. We Belong Together (about to be a HUGE hit)6. Stay The Night (i believe will be 3rd single, hot tamale)7. Get Your Number (SHOULD be 3rd single. people will buy the album for this song by itself!)9. Circles (heartbreaking ballad...especially the 2nd verse. my favorite song lyrically)Overall this album will be a commercial and critical success. with such mass appeal it's bound to garner a few more hit singles, and probably a few awards come next spring. Go Mimi!"
4,MC(Mimi) Shines again,I was so impressed with this latest album. I love mariah carey and she has an amazing voice! I have to say this is probably her best albem yet!The best songs are:We belong togetherI wish you knewStay the nightCirclesSay Somethin
5,Vision of Mariah,"Mariah Carey has laid out a new path and vision for herself with ""The Emancipation of Mimi."" This is her most reassured and confident work in years. She puts probably her best song to date on ""Mimi,"" ""We Belong Together."" Words can't really describe how exquisite this song is. One of her most flawless vocal performances. But it doesn't end there. ""Mimi"" has something for everyone: R&B, Hip-Hop, Pop. If you're a Mariah fan or a new one, I wouldn't hesitate to pick ""Mimi"" up before they're all gone."
3,A Mediocre Effort,"This CD is not as bad as some people suggest although it does fall short of a masterpiece... I give it three stars because I love all the songs on this album in which Mariah is collaborating with other artists, aside from that the rest of the CD falls absolutely flat.... Best songs: ""It's like that"", ""Get Your Number"" and ""One and Only""....one exception is ""We Belong Together""; she comes off pretty well on that one (without anyone's help) but that's it....hopefully next time she will come out with a more satisfactory album....."
2,I only like 1 song.,"I didn't buy ths cd. But, I've listened to most of the songs on it because one of my friends has it. I have never really liked Mariaya(however yo spell it) Carey's music. I don't know, it just doesn't touch me. I only gave it 2 stars because of that one song""We Belong Together.""...If that is the only song you like you shouldnt buy the cd. I hope I am beeing helpful."
5,so mariah uses her voice in different ways,"which is why she ""screams"" some of the notes which give the songs depth at times. Mariah would be a cliche and boring vocalist like whitney and celine who never take risks with their vocals like mariah does. If you want to hear real screaming that can make your ears bleed, look at ashlee simpson"
3,Carey Comeback,"The Emancipation of Mimi finds Mariah Carey coming back strong and returning to her mid 1990's glory. Ms. Carey's voice is in first rate form and the song selections fit her style. The album starts off on the wrong foot with the Jermaine Dupri produced ""It's Like That"", but rebounds nicely with the strong threesome, the megahit ""We Belong Together"", the follow-up hit ""Shake It Off"", which even better than its predecessor and the even better still, ""Mine Again"" which has a sleek & sexy neosoul groove. It wouldn't be a Mariah Carey album without a guest rapper and Snoop Dogg shows up on the solid ""Say Somethin'"". The best track on the album is silky ""I Wish You Knew"" which has tight production, punchy horns and a powerful, but not overstated vocal. The album has shown that Ms. Carey can once again be a major commercial force."
3,A return to her former style its not,Picked up the CD today...and briefly scanned it...been a big fan of her heartfelt ballads and was hoping that there would be more of these...a return to what she was when she started out. Sadly it's lacking in that department. If you like the new flavor of Mariah with her posse of Rap artists...then you'll surely like this. I can usually take or leave it...usually just leave it...but it's like that.
1,The menstruation of Mumu,"Mariah Carey: Living proof that record sales do not reflect talent. Take the vocals away from this tired album and you've got the basics for every R&B; meets pop release in the past year. Mariah Carey lacks the creativity to write songs that sound unique, interesting, or thought provoking. Every song runs together like a never-ending nightmare. If you are a closet-case gay, or a young girl with low self-esteem and braces, this is the record for you.Otherwise, keep Mimi away from YouYou.In addition, the rating system does not offer zero, which this album begs to be given.For those of you who might not have heard the album, all you have to do is turn to your local top 40 station. It will played intermittantly every hour along with all the rest of the boring fodder that they insist we listen to."
1,What a letdown,I bought into the hype of this album and was simply let down. I long for the days of old school Mariah when her music really moved me. Now her songs have no emotions or feeling to them. Better luck next time.
1,"Sorry, Mariah!","These songs are average, but I gave it one star because she's such a cash-in. You can't tell me she's not. You can't tell me that when she travelled 11 places from #15 to #4 this week on the Billboard and when she went 13 places from #47 to #34 in the UK because of the Platinum edition, that she wouldn't have laughed and not said: ""Haha, you fools. I honestly only released this fourth edition of the album for your money."" Pathetic."
1,Not the great comeback everyone says it is.,"I'm truly sorry this CD was released and labeled as the comeback of the voice or whatever they chose to call it. Quite honestly this CD is nothing special. The biggest hit ""We Belong Together"" sounds like every other song in the category of sappy love songs. Mariah's last good CD was Butterfly, it is all downhill after that CD. Hopefully the next album will be better but until then steer clear of Emancipation... its bad... real bad."
2,The good times have passed ...,"Where are the good times when Mariah's voice sounded all over U.S. as a hymn to love an sensuality? I used to like Mariah very much, and every time that she realeased an album I bought it and I wasn't disappointed until the ""Glitter"" album was released, which was a flop for her as well as the movie ""Glitter"". The ""Charmbracelet"" tha came afterwards gave me an impression that Mariah was back on track, so I ran to the stores to buy ""The Emancipation of Mimi"" as soon as it came out, to my deep disappointment there wasn't a single song I liked on this CD, the beat is rather boring and the lyrics are regular. She doesn't show anymore the full potential of her beautiful voice.If you don't know Mariah Carey's music I recommend you to buy her older albums such as ""Daydream"" ""#1's"" and ""The Greatest hits""! They are great!"
3,"Carey, worthy of the Urban Genre. Now time to move on?","Carey has proven to us for some time now, that she is able to make it in the Urban Genre. Some may criticize her for this decision,having moved from Adult Contemporary ballads and all. Carey herself has claimed that her true expression is in Urban. However, it's time for this well rounded artist to move on. Her grasp onto Urban style is getting monotonous and isn't very sharp. Her songs do not grasp us viscerally.One thing that I find admirable is Carey's abilities to write her own material lyrically. Makes you miss her collaborative days With Walter Afanasieff. With Afanasieff's composition and Carey's lyric's, the product proved much success. What ever happened?This ablum, though techinally proficient, lacks substance. ""The Emancipation of Mimi"" I would describe as Urban Blase."
1,The Emancipation of Mimi,Not much variety.I'm sorry.All of Mariah's songs sound the same in my opinion.i prefer Madonna's album over this mediocrity.
1,dreadful,"Mariah is at her same old lame tricks, washed out ballads and fake R&B, please stop making records and stop bothering innocent listeners"
1,such a terrible attempt!!!,it sounds so awful!!! i dont know why people like this tras-!! i will sell it back on ebay for my money!!!
1,Uh noo..,"Ok, I'll admit Mariah Carey did have it all back in the 1990s. She had a very powerful voice but that all ended when she incorporated that hip-hop/rap bullcrap in her songs. The second she had that song with Puff Pappy or whatever his name was, she was out in my book.Another thing, her attitude is so ""better-than-thou"". I actually find it funny that her ""lambs"" claim she is a better entertainer than Madonna. Mariah is not in Madonna's league! Madonna has reinvented her style time and time again, she didn't hop on any bandwagon for success and doesn't need lame guest appearances on her albums to get attention.Next! Mariah needs a new gimmick per-say QUALITY songs like ""Emotions"", ""Vision of Love"", ""Dreamlover"", ""Fantasy"" and her best song to date, ""Hero""."
3,DECENT,I like this album very much!ive always been a mariah fan and im happy for her new great album.Ive always loved researchings singers with a high-octave range..my most recent favorite is AnA Cristina! shes has a 6 octave range and is cuban-american! AMAZING STUFF!plus piano and guitar player..I also like Minnie Riperton.-she had a great voice
3,Are you tired Mimi...?,"Mimi is a name used for children in Spanish cultures when they are tired. I think Maybe Mariah needs a nap...? I think there are a few good songs on this album, I enjoyed Shake it off very much and maybe two or three others that really caught my ear, but I don't think it is at all up to her usual standard (not including Glitter). But I would buy it again if I lost the C.D. It's an easy listen... x x x. p.s... why would anyone trust a review on Mariah Carey written by someone with the name Heavy Metal??? Go figure..."
3,I HATE TO BE MEAN BUT.....,Ok first of all i dont see how great mariah carey is. Her music is good but she is a horrible person who says mean things about people all the time and her voice cracks. Like in Shake it off and We belong togeter her voice cracks atleast like 2 times. I mean anyways can sing her songs unlike eminem or usher who have are extremely talented and have amazing breath control. Many people just like her because she's so cute and innocent looking. So if u support this kind of person i guess its worth it but if you hate her dont buy it!
1,"If you USED to like Mariah, don't bother...","The hip-hop Mariah just isn't any good. The songs suck, even though she sings them brilliantly and her voice is just as good as ever. It's such a waste and a loss for her to sing these awful songs when her potential is so tremendous. I hope she is happy with these songs and her current style, but I will never buy another Mariah CD unless she goes back to making beautiful music."
3,REALLY OVERRATED,I DONT THINK ITS DA BEST ALBUM OF 2005 ITS ALRIGHT SHE OVER SINGS ON SOME OF THE SONGS AND SOME OF THE SONGS ARE JUST IIGHTITS LIKE THAT 9/10 HOT FIRST SINGLEWE BELONG TOGETHER 10/10 KILLS THE END OF DA SONGSHAKE IT OFF 8/10 ITS ALRIGHTSAY SOMETHIN' FT SNOOP 10/10 I LIKE THIS SONGSTAY THE NIGHT 8/10GET YOUR NUMBER 4/10 I SKIPP THIS SONGONE AND ONLY 4/10 I SKIP THIS 2CIRCLES 10/10 CUTE SONGYOUR GIRL 5/10I WISH YOU KNEW 5/10 I SKIPP THIS 2TO THE FLOOR FT NELLY 2/10 WORST SONG ON THE ALBUMJOY RIDE 4/10 SKIP THIS 2FLY LIKE A BIRD 3/10 SKIP THIS 2I JUS THINK THIS ALBUM IS ALRIGHT AND ITS VERY OVERATTED BUT ITS STILL STRAIGHT I WILL FORGET ABOUT THIS ALBUM BY NEXT MONTH ITS IIGHT JUS SOILD.MINE AGAIN 10/10
1,eww,"why must she be naked in every video...with her fat @$$ out? and why would anyone wanna listen to someone whispering through songs?...thats all i hear in all of her cds..oh yeah, the songs are boring."
1,Paying Roger Friedman from Fox News can't save this disaster,"It is a very well known fact (and has been posted all over the internet) that Mariah's record company paid Roger Friedman (a laughed at entertainment reporter) from Fox News to hype this album up a month before it's release. They probably had to pay the very few critics who gave it good reviews. Most hated this album and they were right. Mariah Carey doesn't sing. Instead, she screams and screatches like a little puppy. She has employed various rappers to cover up for her lack of vocal talent. ""It's Like That"" might have been a good song had a real vocalist been employed to sing it..not an aging 45 year old washed up has-been."
1,I'm sorry Mimi but,"This album sucks. Nothing good is on here. Only good track is ""It's Like That"". If you like this album you're crazy. I'm sorry, I like Mariah Carey, but this album sux, really sux. Her vocals squeal all the time, I don't count that as singing. And her beats, WTF JD? Sorry, M. I luv yha, but PLEASE make a good album.Oh, if you click no because you disagree, that's 100% unfair. Your supposed to click those if you think the review is helpful, NOT TO VOTE IF YOU DISAGREE WITH MY RATING!!! Just one thing, because a lot of one-star and two-star helpful reviews recieve poor ratings 4 no good reazon."
1,Mariah Pimps Fox News Reporter to Hype new album,"How desperate does a fading diva become when she has to pay Fox News to hype this album. If you don't believe me, talk to someone who works at Fox news. People are fuming over there about it and the fact that their ""entertainment reporter"" still has a job. Ok..the album..completely disgusting. How does a diva with the greatest voice in musical History turn into anR&B; (...) who sings like a dying elephant? ""It's Like that,"" the first flop single, is the most desperate thing any aging diva has ever done. ""To The Floor"" is the only good song on the album. Unfortunately, Mariah has to pimp Nelly for this one. She pimps a different rapper on every different song. Poor woman!"
1,Mariah - stop torturing yourself and us,"I had always been a big fan of Mariah and I love all her albums up to Rainbow but everything pretty much went downhill from there. Since leaving Sony, Mariah tries hard to change her image and become a R&B singer with disasterous results. This album ,which has been hailed as ""The Return of the Voice"" is a complete dissapointment. The first single and also first song on the album is not that bad but it would have been even better if someone else like Ashanti or Beyonce had sung it. Mariahs voice doesn't fit. Her voice....another problem. There is no denying it now : She has lost it. On the album, for example in the song ""Mine Again"", it screetches and warbles in ways that it almost painful. Mariah do us all a favour: Stop singing and start a family or do something else in your life. Your time as a star is officially over."
1,Mariah Carey's worst album ever!!!!!!!!!!,"I feel betrayed. But that's the point, Mariah had to make an alliance with hip hop, r&b... for reviving her faded musical career... But no matter how well this CD sells, her glory moments of her first CD won't come back again. The Emancipation of Mimi is garbage, pure trash. People are blind, Mariah is not innovative. Too many ""featuring"" songs... Where's her personal touch, her seal? Almost all her songs sound the same. How can people recognize her as the best selling and most successful female artist of all times? That's a big mistake. Please, count the copies again, then talk. And Mariah, retire please, and take some acting classes. You're such a bad actress, and video-clips need to be believable, for they are short films."
3,Good but Not Great,She is the 3rd best selling female of all time (only Madonna and Nana Mouskori have sold more) and here she is in all her glory - again ... this album was good but not great and the rerelase only necessary for fans..
3,!!!!,"I reviewed this album before thinking it was the bomb. But when I heard her new song ""Don't Forget About Us"", I was like, ""Hey, wait a minute! That's not in my CD! What's wrong?"" Then I found out she was releasing it again. I am so disapointed. I am only a kid and now I have to buy it again. (I don't have to but I love ""Don't Forget About Us"") I'm sure Mariah had a reasonable explanation... But when her NEW NEW NEW CD comes out, I think I'll just buy a used one on Amazon instead of wasting my hard earned money on a brand new one. Well, thank you Mariah. I love your songs. I just don't understand why I have to buy the same CD again. Why couldn't you have just... Put that song on the original ""Emancipation of Mimi""??? In time, I think I'll come to forgive her. Maybe it's not even her fault. I'm just saying, everyone who bought her original album... WAS TRICKED. And I was dumb enough to be one of them."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this album with high hopes. I always loved Mariah Carey's older music. I loved ""We Belong Together"" from the moment I heard it on the radio. But then I purchased the album and realized that most of the songs sound the same- making the album slow and boring. I wasn't WOW'd. For some strange reason I can't help but picture a young Michael Jackson singing these songs instead of it being Mariah. Her pitch and tone just sounds completely different in this album. Mariah, what happened? I'm just not that impressed."
2,Just average&a waste of Talent,"Mariah Carey has One of the Most Known Musical Instruments in the History of Music Making,but sadly she hasn't gotten the right material to Highlight it Properly. by Now Mariah Carey should have gotten that Minnie Riperton or Deniece Williams Material that I know She could do.the Soul is Missing from much of Her work over time.this album is just ok at best.dime a dozen production that is slick&Polished but has nothing really to do with words&Music. Mariah could have dropped this Album from anywhere between 95-00&I ask what is the difference? the same formula.She might not ever reach the same heights she had back in Her Hey Day in the Early to Mid 90's but at least she should get better Material to showcase Her Instrument way better than this Fast-Food one stop drive thru material She is getting for a Album these days."
2,* Very Mediocre *,"Mariah Carey is not at her best with this CD. Her songs all sound the same and sound like every other R&B; song on the market today. I am very upset about this. Mariah has a wonderful voice which she seems unwilling to use the way she used to (unless she can't any longer). This CD is not worth it. There is one catchy song on there (Its Like That) which in actuality isn't as good or doesn't have the depth that any of her previous number 1 hits in the 1990's had.If you like the silly, simple minded, cookie-cutter R&B; that is currently on the airwaves, then you probably will like this ... BUT, if you liked the sultry, high note and smooth style of Mariah in the 1990's watch out! Find some way to listen to this CD before you buy. I listened to the songs on Rapsody.com but I think you can listen to snipets here."
2,A complete waste of money,"I listened to all the hype about this album and, against my first instinct after seeing her interview on Oprah, bought it this morning anyway. It was such a disappointment. I miss the Mariah of ""Someday"", ""Vision"", ""Can't Let Go"", ""I Don't Wanna Cry"", ""Can't Live""... I know that's all so 90's. But that was when she was really good and really special. Now, she sounds like everyone else doing her style of music on the Top 40. That is not the Mariah Carey that I used to like. I'm not sure why artists try that whole reinvention thing. They disappear for awhile and come back reinvented. And their music is never as good. Her vocal quality is still as good. But the composition of the songs was completely unappealing to me. I'm selling it used to recupe some of my money. What a bummer!"
2,"So much potential, so much crap...","Mariah is a legend because of the albums she had where she used her voice and her talent. Her sound was strong and clear, not this whispery half-hearted effort she exhibits on her last few albums, this one included. Granted there is a little more of her voice on this album, but it's sparse and still not what she's capable of. Mariah sounds like so many other no-name R&B; singers on this album, and with the strength her voice has it makes it much more painful.Go back to your roots, Mariah. This style isn't flattering."
1,The Constipation of Mimi,"One of the most annoying singers on earth is back after an extended (and welcomed) vacation and she's on top again, thanks to one great song on this cd, ""We Belong Together,"" which takes her back to her roots and is the type of ballad that she does well. This probably annoys her to no end considering that she is still the diva wanna-be, trying so hard to be ""hip hop"" and becoming an embarrassment in the process. The album cover photo, obviously borrowed from Beyonce, should be a warning! She's even darkened her skin tone! (shades of Michael Jackson???) ""We Belong Together"" is the only decent song on the cd - a jazzy ""Stay The Night"" is a good try -but most of the music here is tired and mediocre (especially ""Shake It Off,"" the second release, which has to be one of the most irritating songs ever recorded!)"
2,"Not that Good,few gems lots of filler..who is giving 5 stars","I love Mariah Carey, she is a true vocalist of out time and no one can take that away from here. The emancipation of mimi has only about 3 or 4 songs that is good. we belong together, get ur number( a good dance number), ""I wish u knew(very soulful)"" which is the only standout track and the highlight of the album. The rest are just fillers.(...). This cd is not that good wish I just downloaded the only 3 tracks that I liked."
1,Queen of Screams,"So Mariah tries to redeem herself from her Glitter and Charmbracelet disasters. But this is hardly impressive. I don't understand how everyone else can say that this is the best CD they've ever owned or the best Mariah has ever done. IT ISN'T! She simply screams and screams and screams at the end of each song to prove that she can still ""sing"". But if you like screaming, then I guess this would be the perfect album."
5,Mariah Has Trully Emancipated,"I have to admit I have never been a fan of Mariah's music, except for fantasy But, with The Emancipation Of MImi, Mariah has definitely gotten my attention. All the tracks are perfectly done. Vocals are tremendously great. Mariah is definetely back. Congratulations Mimi, you gave us a great album. I trully recommend this record even if youre not a mariah fan, buy it and listen to it I'm pretty sure youre going to love this record, even if you have to hide it from other people (that is if you dont want to admit youre listening to a mariah album). Overall a 5 Star debut."
5,All expectations met...,"Yeah...everyone's all geared up for her latest album..and in the end u'll either find people hating it or loving it.It's as if u have to either be a mariah carey fan or not one.There's no way a reviewer with half a brain could possibly give her 1 star for this album. Sadly, there were a few dopes who did. If anything it should be given at least 3 stars, she definitely makes a comeback in this album. I'm not just saying it just cause i'm a mariah carey fan but i'm basing it on the production and her vocal talents alone.Obviously you can't expect every song on the album to be your favorite, but i can honestly say that every track is at the very least good....a few of them are definitely addictive. Her voice soars in this album like you won't believe...Try listening to ""Mine Again"",""Stay The Night"",""Joy Ride"" and ""Your Girl"", and you'll breathe a sigh of relief..finally convinced that Mariah Carey IS indeed the voice."
5,Work amazingly well done!,"Im from Sweden so I have had this cd for a week now, and let me tell you. It only gets better and better, it grows. It has a great mix of songs for everyone to enjoy. Stay the night, we belong together and fly like a bird are amazing and so are the rest of the songs. I just love it and I play it at least once a day. Im really happy that she is using her voice like it is meant to be used.Mariah is the best singers of all time and this cd proves it.I would give it ten stars if I could.WOW. Radio, Mtv and Ztv are playing her all the time up here.Well done Mariah!"
4,Some great songs,"Wow, some great songs here especially We Belong Together. Some of the best songs Mariah has done in 10 years. A little bit too much Hip Hop attempts here, not really needed. The ballads are beautiful though, and I cannot grow tired of the big single We Belong Together (deserves 3 months at #1). A great comeback, can't wait for the next CD!"
4,Really Good.,"I first started liking Mariah when I heard that song Sweetheart with JD. I've liked her ever since. However,I did not purchase Glitter or Charmbracelet. I did enjoy the movie Glitter though. I also enjoyed all her singles I heard also. Now she's at it again with Its Like That and We Belong Together. These songs are great this CD is also really good. My favorites are Its Like That,We Belong Together,Shake It Off,Get Your Number,One And Only,and To The Floor. If you like Mariah you'll enjoy this CD."
1,Oink Oink Oink,"I didn't know Miss Piggy had a new cd out!! Oh wait a minute, that is Mariah Carey. The years without Tommy Mottola have turned her into a fat hooker who has to have 80 guest rappers on her albums so she can be ""hip"" to the 12 year olds and sell millions of albums. I guess it proves you don't have to have talent to have a recording career. I'd like to shake YOU off!!"
3,"Good cd, actually 3 1/2 stars","I like Mariah Carey's new cd. To me, all of the songs are enjoyable. The ones that truly stand out are: It's like that, We belong together (my favorite and one of Mariah's best songs), Shake it off, Say Something, One and only and Fly like a bird. As I said before, the other songs aren't bad, they just don't stand out like the ones I just mentioned. Some people say the voice is back; I doubt it ever left, it just doesn't hit the high notes like she used to."
5,A Stunning Performance......The Queen Is Back,"I believe that this may be be Mariah's greatest achievement in the music industry yet. I think that this album shows Mariah's true voice. It really ""emancipates"" her talent!! I think the best songs on the album are ""Get Your Number"" and ""Circles."" I love how she belts those notes out. Mariah is back and she's hot!"
5,THE EDUCATION OF MARIAH !!!,"Simply put, Mariah Carey is showing you how it's done with this album...""We Belong Together"" has just become the biggest radio hit America has EVER seen, not to mention having the #1 album and song on the Billboard Charts..Some might think it's 1995-1996 when she repeated the trick, but no ITS 2005 AND SHE IS JUST AS BIG...Don't be fooled by haters bacause they complain when she whispers, they complain whe she hits the hig notes, and they complain because she's sold nearly 200 million albums and singles worldwide..All that at age 35...Now onto the rest of the album...Get Your Number and Say Something are dance hits, but Mine Again and Joyride really stick out on this album. Honestly this is the first Mariah album I can play completely through and be happy with. Vocally this album is strong and that's what its truly all about."
4,"Mariah is Mariah, it's always been that way","It was Longest Recording periods for Mariah CareyPrevious HUGE fan of myself, i know that her voice somehowfaded. but with this album she bring that like 80% of early 90'sSome people expecting stuff like early 90's, please move on.any other artist can't survive, doing same material for a decadeAlso i'm happy to see the result that now some how she didfit in Trendy R&B; format, well still some of stuff is justun-exceptable, but it is worth to listenI really getting hooked on We Belong Together & Mine Again.Lyrics are absolutely touching & moving.And for the last, Even Beyonce' is not original. since whenshe was original ? she is from Destiny's Child rip-off versionof Copy version music videos of TLC"
2,Not Mariah At Her Best,We Belong Together is a classic Mariah song. Unfortunately- that and Shake It Off are the only good songs on the CD. I really like Mariah's voice- but she just doesn't do anything interesting with this record. I wish she would take more chances and be more creative.
3,Disappointed Diva Fan,"Mariah really has emancipated her style. Kudos for her keeping her diva vocals, but she is losing herself in booty-style songs while trying to stay glamorous. It is definitely original, but not so hot. I love the first 2 tracks, and it is all downhill from there. Maybe she should stick to her orginal genre and skip a copycat booty-Beyonce journey. Mimi needs her own image, since she is unique and God-talented."
1,Has-Been Human Dog Whistle,"Poor Mariah...she has faded so bad that this album has flopped worldwide. She is a glorified dog whistle. The only good song on this album is ""We Belong Together."" Other than that, don't bother."
1,I don't understand all the hype,"I admire Mariah Carey, and I think she has a terrific voice. However, I'm baffled by all the good hype about this album. Every song sounds like the song before.Ms. Carey is a great talent. However, I think she needs to find either a better songwriter, or a producer who can find her better songs.If you listen to this album, you won't find a tune you can sing, hum, or recognize from another.That, in my opinion, is what makes a great singer--someone who can immortalize a song."
5,Mariah's new album,"Mariah's vocals are still great and strong in this album. Her vocals are very powerful, great and really strong just like they have always been."
1,Is this all about publicity stunt?,"When it comes to music, people always refer things such as this or that, but does anyone really know how music is emancipated? This album isn't emancipation at all. The tracks ""I Like That"" and ""We Belong Together"" are some tracks I rate 2.5 stars. The others are 0 stars. This album is just for publicity stunt, just for Mariah not to let her fans keep left-checked."
2,Don't buy the full CD. Buy the remixed single only.,"I must say, I was very disappointed with this CD. First of all, Mariah's voice sounds (to me) like she has lost those high notes she hit in her 1st. 3 albums. In this album she does try something different & for this I give Mariah a lot of credit. I just don't think this Hip Hop theme really fits Mariah's song writing. For one, Mariah doesn't have any rythm to get into this type of songs. I love the idea of the video to the cover song but it's in slow motion to cover up Mariah's inability to get into it?"
1,Very old styled album!,"All of the songs here are from 90's and 80's genre. The vocals are good but there is a little ""filler"" in each song. I was very disaapointed and, I wasted my money."
1,Memo to Ayon,"Ayon, you are in fact incorrect when you say that Mariah is the best-selling female artist ever. Madonna is, and you can just check Wikipedia and the Guiness Book of World Records if you do not believe me."
5,"She back, so get ready for it!!!","Haters...the more you hate, the more she's going to sell. So just step back and let it go because you're wasting your time. I'm sorry that Mariah has a great voice and I'm sorry that she made a great album. I've accepted it. Why can't you? I've come to terms with the fact that she's one of the greatest singers ever. I'm dealing with her undeniable knack for making hits. I'm no longer struggling with her ability to trump her critics at the drop of a dime. In time you will understand, as a 1-star reviewer, that you have made a complete fool of yourself repeatedly by posting lame reviews. One day you shall realize the gravity of your error. But until your day of realization, until your brain comes back from vacation, may I suggest an emancipation. I know you'll love it. Just risk the temptation. But should you not want to play along, and listen to Mariah's beautiful songs. I can sit here and write 5-star reviews all day long. Thank you. The End."
4,Very nice,"Best album in many years. I listen to Charmbracelet back to back with the new album and what a difference. Honestly there was barely a good song on Charmbracelet and Glitter. She really sounds like she has her grove back here, not just better songs but great vocal delivery (almost sounding like her earlier albums). My only complaint is the switching from ballads to R&B. I never cared so much for her modern R&B, it doesnt sound genuine. Although I liked her earlier R&B songs (80's and early 90's albums). Had she stuck with mostly ballads here, it would have been a potential Grammy award in my opinion. But never the less, this is a great CD and YES it is a comeback! Mariah was almost dead commercially (2 bad CDs) and now the new CD GOLD in 2 weeks, pretty impressive! I hope she doesnt go road shy again, would love to hear it all live!!"
5,Best Pop/R&B Female,"After 15 years, Mariah is still the BEST Pop/R&B female in the industry. There are many copies and imitations out there, but Mariah is the original. The one and only. No need to compare her to the other Pop/R&B divas because there's no contest. Mariah's talent looms large over her competitors. You don't get to be Mariah Carey by being average. She's the best and everyone knows it. And now she's making her own history by making a GREAT album and proving everybody else wrong. If you're a true Mariah fan and you don't have this album, then you're really missing out."
5,Refreshing. Fun.,"This one of Mariah's best music compilations. It's a nice blend of R & B ballad, hip hop, dance tracks with a little contemporary gospel thrown in for good measure. This new CD showcases her amazing vocal range. Make no mistake: Mariah is an excellent vocalist. Think Minnie Ripperton. She's one of the best in the industry.Mariah Carey was the top selling female artist in the 90's for good reason. She has real talent. The one star ratings are bogus!Best cuts: We Belong Together, Mine Again, Shake if Off, Say Somethin'Peace."
5,Excellent!!!,"Wow, this CD must be on track to sell big with all the haters coming out in full force like this. This is by far Mariah's best album. Her vocals really shine on this CD. I wasn't sure what to expect even though I've been a Mariah fan forever. But I was not disappointed, but pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the album. This is the first great CD of 2005. Get this one.1. It's Like That 10/102. We Belong Together 10/103. Shake It Off 7/104. Mine Again 10/105. Say Something 8/106. Stay The Night 10/107. Get Your Number 10/108. One And Only 10/109. Circles 9/1010. Your Girl 9/1011. I Wish You Knew 10/1012. To The Floor 10/1013. Joy Ride 10/1014. Fly Like A Bird 10/10"
5,Mariah Is Free,"When I first heard the single off her new album first I thought someone was tryin to act like her, then I heard a DJ say that it was Mariah Carey I was like, are you serious this cant be, Mariah is back in full effect with her new album she is the bomb and like I said before this lady way run Whitney Houston dont get me wrong Whitney is still a Diva, but she scares me alot when shes going to rebhab you know, but Mariah is on topIs Like That 10/10We belong together 10/10Circles 10/10Mine Again 10/10Fly Like A Bird 10/10To the floor 10/10Mariah is back and I dont think shes going anywhere no time soon Beyonce, Ashanti, Amerie back the hell up cux the real diva is hasnt ever lost her crown -peace Brian Hines"
4,Too Many Haters...,"Look, I just want to say to all those people who are complaning about wanting 90's Mariah back. I just want ya'll to know THIS IS 2005!!!! None of you could be REAL Mariah fan's...unless ya'll want her to fail. Why would you want her to sing 90's ballads?? I dont get it! She would not sell! I want to know what kind of music do you people listen to who are writing the negative reviews? Barbara Streisand or something? To be a musical artist YOU HAVE TO ADAPT OR DIE. If Mariah sang 90's ballads, then people who have something else to complain about, like ""Oh she's stuck in the 90's"". Poor Mimi...YOU CANT WIN. BUT I STILL LOVE YOU! EMANCIPATION IS HOT!! CIRCLES IS DAT JOINT! and so is SAY SOMETHING, AND SHAKE IT OFF. 4/5 stars...cause nobody is perfect...there's always roomfor improvement, otherwise I'd give u a 5. And I give a finger to all those HATERS."
1,Disappointing and mediocre,"This album is so dull and uninspiring I would have fallen asleep listening to it if it weren't for the screechy, grating and annoying voice of this wailing banshee. I miss the style, elegance and finesse of the diva that was the Mariah of her Tommy Mottola days. Miss Carey has not, in my opinion, aged well."
3,Mimi gets better with time.,"When i first listened to this cd i didn't like it too much, but after playing it a few times some of the other songs grew on me. Worth it just to get the hits though."
2,I respect her for being able to come back... but....,"This album is no good. Half of the songs sound almost the same and are frankly, just.... boring.I know many disagree and she is doing extremely well but that is just me...One of the boringest CDs of the year...Confessions on a Dance Floor >>>> Emancipation of MiMi"
4,Made me a Fan,"As much as i HATES mariah, this cd ""made me a fan"" I give her all the props in the world. But, get the new version with DOnt FOrget About Us instead.Must Listens-Mine Again-Get Your Number-One and Only-Say Somethin'"
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This CD is wonderful! I love Mariah's voice, and the songs are great too! Definetly the best Mariah CD yet! You gotta listen to it!!"
1,1 star for one good song,We Belong Together is the only good song on here. Dont Forget About Us is the same exact song. This is my first Mariah CD and it will be my last.
2,Lock Mimi Back Up!,"Mariah Carey is a well-known artist and is well-known for this being one of the most crappiest albums of our time! The only decent song is ""We Belong Together."" Mariah writes oh-so-stupidlyrics and when I looked at the booklet, I noticed that there are dirty words, bad words, cussing, whatever you call it on thealbum! She even says the word f*** on this CD! This is not an album made for kids with her swearing, and Nelly, Snoop Dogg, and J.D. guest starring. Like Bow Wow's new release, ""Wanted,""this should have a parental advisory marking on it. Please buythe ""We Belong Together"" single and refrain from this album.(...)"
4,Very Good Cd!!!!!!,"Its about time Mariah starts singing in her songs instead of whispering. While I feel this is a very good cd, it still has some whispering moments, but they are all intact and where they should be. The past couple albums there was too much whisper singing and trying to sound sexy which to me ruined alot of good songs on those cds if only they had been sung better. I read in an interview she doesnt feel she should have to blow you away in every song, yet in my opnion she doesnt have to either yet come on and sing and not whisper girl!. LOL. Anyway this cd is very good. I hope it does well for her. I wasnt going to buy it, so i made sure I listened to it first before buying and I must say today Im going to go buy it. The whole cd is very good and hopefully should do well for Mariah. While my favorite music of Mariah's will always be her first 3 cd's, she will always have a place in my heart for anything she does. Good luck Mariah :)"
2,Quite disappointing,"I'm a longtime mariah fan, and I miss ""Music box"" and ""daydream"" eras. Since ""Rainbow"" Mariah only concentrates on her image and it hurts her work. I hope she will be soon back on her roots. Her voice is as magic as ever but I don't like half of the disc.The worst track: ""get your number""The best track: ""we belong together"". mariah should do more tunes like this one. It's the perfect Mariah song, the rest of the album is forgettable, Im' not sure it will stand the test of time"
1,Worst Album of the Year,Definitely the worst Album of the Year. Not a single track stands out. Bland boring same old Mariah songs. Her music died since Music Box. Don't waste your money on this. Better off to give your money to charity.
4,nice but..,"why is the lyrics that just cliche?cliche..cliche..When you left I lost a part of meIt's still so hard to believeCome back baby, pleaseCause we belong together"
3,The Emancipation of Mimi,"Maria (Mimi) could not have made a better deal then to collaborate with the record promoter (whose name escapes me this minute) and the other rappers, Nelly, Snoop. The album is a hit. Maria is known for pumping out the hits, and now that she is more mature, 'an adult' even, her lyrics relay experience, love, heartbreak and recovery."
4,Excellent Source of Opinions and Knowledge,This book is an excellent source for information. The number of diverse articles contained within its covers provide for many examples and opinions for someone working on a research paper. Also many ideas and inspirations canbe found for topics to think about or discuss and debate with close friends. I would highly recommend.
1,"good enuf beginner, with c# and vb.net experience","for someone who is a beginner and have a knack andunderstanding for ms technologies, I was pleased thatmost of the examples actually worked. I was howeverdisapointed in the poor explanations into how theprogram worked. This was cruicial since if the exampledid not work, i would have no idea how to debug it.In addition the lack of or poor explanation would makethe book extremely difficult to finish off since thefoundations of the technology was never explained.This is somewhat of an advanced book however, i didgive it 3 stars due to working examples did work, eventhough I learnt v little in why.As mentioned from a previous reviewer, the downloads are badly disorganised, its a very tough book to get through and there arealready errors in chapter5 alongside missing downloadble examples"
1,Poorly written,This book is not organized at all. There are allot of code examples but they are totally useless. Since one can not really run any of the examples because they are not organized into applications and one can't really follow which part does what and which part goes after which. And I have successful 10 years of experience developing web and client service apps. So this book was waste of time and money for me.
3,good..but old,"For a beginner its good. I liked the way concepts are expressed.I just wish I read this few a couple of years ago, when it came out!"
1,It's the worstever I read,It's the worstever I read. It's not worth [the price]. 300 pages out of 608 are case studies & appendix. Only two chapters on asp.net web services & .net remoting. No explanation about namespaces.
3,Multi-Headed Wrox book lacks focus,"While this book does cover C# and Web Services in reasonable detail, it does so in a poorly organized manner. For example, descriptions are often repeated in detail across chapters probably due to multiple authors and a lack of total vision.This book is an example of Wrox's problem with delivering multi-author books that are focused and well executed."
5,I found this to be a good source of information...,Don't know why others are saying this isn't a great book. I think it is!
2,"If you like ""Hate the Sun"", hesitate on the rest","I bought this CD after becoming hopelessly addicted to ""Hate the Sun"". Sadly, none of the other songs on this CD are anything at all like that song - they practically sound like they came out of a completely different band. I love the hypnotic, experimental, and almost malicious quality of that one song, and I was really looking forward to an album full of interesting and experimental music. Sadly, every single other track is a pretty bland, sleepy folk-style stuff that I've really just heard a hundred times before. It's decent background music, I suppose. I really wish I'd just bought that one song, though."
4,Sam Spade is alive and well in Munich,"Munich Mambo is the first feature length film by Richard Warmoth. He has produced a movie that features a young `Sam Spade' character with the backdrop of Munich, Germany. There is plenty of action with a touch of romance. You'll find enough twists and surprises to keep your interest until the very end.The producer/director and cast have created an interesting and entertaining movie."
4,"An easy ""stretch and strengthen"" for experienced Pilates students","Beginners would feel ""welcome"" in this instructor's class. She is so NOT intimidating. However, I don't think she provides enough guidance for novices. I would recommend some classic Pilates training before using this. It doesn't cover basics like posture or breathing, focus or precision.However, for someone with some general Pilates knowledge under their belt, this is a fun, alternative workout for ""easy"" days. This teacher just relaxed me. I wouldn't call this video a ""workout,"" rather more of stretch and strengthening session. I especially like it before bed since it ends with a slow, guided, cool-down and relaxation. The instructor's soothing voice and British accent are a bonus!"
1,disappointed,"I had bought Tucks with Anusol before as an ointment. This came with no reference to Anusol and it was a cream. Sorry, I can't use it."
4,Great Father/Son movie Good Guy Movie,"Especially great movie for a father and son to watch together, or grandfather and grandson but also for just about anyone. I bought this movie for a Father's Day present for my ""Papa"" husband and was sorry I didn't buy one for my son and son-in-law also. It is a watch over and over kind of movie. Full of speed and rooting for the good guy etc. Randy Quaid was tip top in this (as always....not referred to as Dennis' brother for along time now!) I highly recommend this movie for a time when you want to get your guys to sit down and watch a movie that isn't a ""chick flick"" but has some heart and motors in it too! I liked it myself! The Nana"
3,Live your dreams...,"Kart Racer is a fun movie starring Randy Quaid as the father of a kid who dreams of being a kart racer. The young lad, Watts Davies (Will Rothaar) gets into more trouble trying to pursue his dream. He convinces his dad (an ex-kart champion) to help him and this turns into a very positive film.My husband, use to race at local tracks in southern California, liked this one and he hardly ever sits down and watches anything with me. He pointed out some of the racing stuff was hyped up and not what really happens, but it was fun and enjoyable.I found the movie to be very predictable, but still very entertaining and one the whole family can enjoy.Amazon had a fantastic deal on this DVD and I bought it not expecting much, but I was wrong..."
4,Diddy's Press Play,"I absolutely love the CD--I am telling my age...I loved Bad Boy back in the day, however, everyone grows up, develops and matures...and that's exactly what this CD displays. A full grown Diddy. I have so many favorites...the joint with Keyshia Cole, Mary J, Chrstine, Diddy's Rock, they are all great."
1,Just plain bad,"As an example, listen to ""Diddy Rock""""Let me be your tour guide,I'm your burger, you my fries...Oh my god that is TERRIBLE. Adding to the lyrics, are the multitracked voices which are out of tune. Stick to producing, diddy"
1,PRESS EJECT!!!,"This materialistic moron must be kidding me.He actually believes that millions of people are going to go out and buy this lame attempt to make even more money off people who are ignorant of the fact that he has no talent.He hired an entire team of rappers and producers to create the album and all he has to say are things like ""bad boy,take that, yeah,im rich""This album sounds like all the other lame albums from this weak label.Do yourself a favor and save your money and stop making this loser rich because he's laughing all the way to the bank from profiting off of people with weak musical tastes."
4,Good Album,"This is a very good CD. The beats are hot, period. I think people just like hatin' on Puffy. I'm not his biggest fan, but great music is great music, and this CD has great music. Obviously not a classic and not worthly of 5 stars, but you really can put this in, press play, and will enjoy what's coming out of your speakers."
1,Love To Give You Zero Stars,"Hey Diddy, What Ever Your Name Is. How Much Did You Paid Billboard To Make Your Album Number One ???"
2,Diddy's back,"He should have named the album ""Press Stop"" because most of the album is garbage. And he doesn't write his own rhymes, he has ghost writers writing for him."
1,Great Beats for a Bad Artist,"I liked his first released single Come to me but the rest of the album I listend to only once and was more than enough. All tracks he just talks thru them, not really rapping or singing. My personal opinion after listening to the album was that it was ashame to waste such great beats on this album on such bad songs."
1,A 1 star album if I ever heard one,"This year really has proven that you don't really need talent to make an album, just someone in the backround making noise(or musack as some of you call it) and start jibbering in front of a microphone and just talk about how full of yourself you really are. Basically from Paris K fed, Lyndsay and rest of the bubble gum isht we get from people that 1-shoud not own a record label and 2- have no talent or charisma whatsoever. Believe me, don't waste your money on him, just think of this, you work very hard to make money and then you decide to buy an unsatisfactory product, then you turn on the TV and you see Diddy on some show wasting your hard earned money on overrated liquor and acting like an assclown.So ending I think we should do the same as D4L and Chingy and it is to give this a 1 star average, come on people we could do this again and show that Media and MTV don't control us."
1,More crap rap,"Yawn. What else is new? Nothing much, that's for damn sure. Let's just say that rap is gone, and it's all thanks to this. P. Diddy is slow, moronic, retarded, and just plain stupid. All we can do is wait for the fad to die out, so that this guy can look back on his life while working at Mcdonalds, just like The Village People and The Bangles (their comeback album? Denied!).Oh, and it you want a real laugh, just look at that ummmm.... cover."
3,"Probably the best beats of 2006! And no, I'm no fan of Diddy's!!","Beyoncé did her thing in 2006 but something about the beats in most of these songs...very infectious.Testimonial (intro) - 9We Gon' Make It - 6.5I Am (interlude) - 7.5The Future - 6.75Hold Up - 5.5Come To Me - 8.5Tell Me - 7.25Wanna Move - 7Diddy Rock - 6.25Claim My Place (interlude) - 7Everything I Love - 7.5Special Feeling - 6.25Crazy Thang (interlude) - 7After Love - 8 (solid, could be a single)Through The Pain (She Told Me) - 7.25 (Mario comes off as whiny)Thought You Said - 7.5 (really loud and different)Last Night - 8.5Making It Hard - 7.25 (Sounded like a B'Day reject.

3,Acceptable,I Must Say Diddy Has Some Good Beats But He Aint Saying Much In Any Of The Songs. My Favorite Song Is Last Night Featuring Keisha Cole and The Only Thing Wrong With It Is The Lyrics But The Beat Is Hot. I Wouldnt Suggest Anyone Buy This CD. Just Go And Download The Songs You Like Off Of Napster!
1,why the he** is he rapping,i'm not sure if this album should be categorized under RAP because it is HORRIBLE i don't see and rhthym and whats up with all these wacky guest. time to retire from music. he turned pop too.
3,Damn! The Hype for nothing...,"I just want to say that I was extremely disappointed with this album. Upon my 15 second rule listen, I only liked three songs. After actually taking time to listen to the album, it only moved up to eight songs total. I do love the futuristic sound of the album all around.I had a bonus disc to come with mine and ""Get Off"" was the only bonus on the disc. If you've ever took a visit over to his Myspace page, you would know that the album version of ""Get Off"" is different from the one on Myspace. I honestly prefer the one that he has on Myspace, it's funkier and more my style.The tracks that I like:*Last Night-No one could have did a better job on that song but Keyshia Cole and we could have did without Diddy singing the hook. The song also sound like a Prince song.*Through The Pain-I love Mario Winans beats and I'm glad he sing on this track as well.*Wanna Move*Hold Up*After Love*Come To Me*Thought You Said*Special Feeling"
2,What exactly did you expect?,"When puffy releases an album you know exactly what you are going to get, the full gambit of commercialism. Yeah the beats are going to tight, some catchy/corny hooks and some sub par lyrics no matter who wrote them. I say the lyrics are sub par because even if Kweli and pharoahe monch wrote for Diddy, you still have to have the delivery and energy of the person who wrote the rhyme. Diddy doesn't have any of the above. To add insult to injury, Diddy also has some of his minions from his everwack record label Bad Boy. Bad Boy as a label died when Biggie did. This is another lack luster release from the bad boy and his crew. Buy at your own risk."
2,Press Stop,"It's Diddy so its sure to have some hot beats, an impressive ""feat."" listing and unfortunately some good ratings by fans. Haven't taken the time to listen to all the tracks, as I was too busy wondering who the hell told Diddy he could sing? He has the rapping down... no doubt!! It's what made him, but ""Last Night"" firstly should be Keyshia Cole ft Diddy as she basically sang everything, secondly the poor girl probably had a had time singing over his tone deaf rambling in the background ever so often. He's an awsome rapper and needs to know his boundaries."
3,The collabos save this cd,I listened to this via my napster subscription service and will not be buying this CD. The collabos are the strength of this CD - in most cases where you have the rap and R&B; fusion - it works.The following tracks have really great beats and the guest artists sound great:- Come To Me feat Nicole of PCD- Tell Me featuring Christina Aguilera- Wanna Move feat Ciara and Big Boi - I really love the beat and chorus of this song and ciara and big boi sound so good on this track.- Everything I Love feat Nas and Cee-lo - I like the beat and Nas' verse is cool.- After Love featuring Keri- Thought You Said featuring Brandy - Brandy sounds great.The first 2 tracks ( we gon' make it and i am) have a retro sound which I like. The next 2 are boring i.e. the future and hold up.The rest of the songs are not worth discussing.
3,Average,"I knew this album would be barely average because Diddy always delivers average albums. The only thing that saved this from a 2 star rating was the production which is great and some of the guests saved songs on here. Anyways songs that I am listening to are ""Come To Me"", ""The Future"", ""After Love"", ""Last Night"" and ""Partners For Life"" and that is it. I only recommend this if you a fan of Diddy and if you a rap fan then stay away from this it will only make you mad."
2,Press play for first 4 songs then hit Eject!,"The only good songs on this CD are the first 4 (We Gon' Make It, The Future, Hold Up, Come To Me). The rest is uninspired filler. Mary J Blige, Nas, and Brandy are wasted on mediocre tracks. Puffy never had much of a flow but the first 4 songs are really banging, some of his best work. Too bad he couldn't sustain the quality through the other 15 tracks"
4,Diddy is back!!,"Diddy's ""PRESS PLAY"" is the Grammy-winning superstar's first solo collection in five years. And this album is HOT. I think Danyel Smith of Vibe Magazine said it best:""With ""Press Play,"" Sean Combs continues to take risks, and to innovate."" Other than the tight beats on just about every track, check out ""The Future."" That is probably the BEST track on this album! A must have for any Diddy fan!"
4,Rewind the Haterade,"The only reason I even checked this album was to get that Nas & Cee-lo collabo on ""Everything I love"", w/o question the flyest hip hop song I've heard in a while, u gotta love the swagger on that track.The rest of the album is not that bad, diddy is second to none when it comes to bringing the best out of a collabo, fact is, he's probably the best when it comes to squeezing the juice out of the people he works with.There's a couple of really good party joints ( ""Tell me"" feat. Christina Aguilera, ""Wanna Move"" feat Ciara, ""Come to me"" feat. Nicole Scherzinger), and the few tracks where Diddy goes solo are pretty good, Diddy holds it down on ""Future"" and ""Hold up"", with some impressive verses here and there, who would have thought the man could actually rhyme.The production is excellent, track after track, not much to skip here, you can actually just Press Play. Enjoy."
1,"Diddy dang, hang it up!","First I have to admit that I was actually anticipating this album a little. Well I just want to thank AOL music for previewing it entirely and saving me 12 dollars. If this isn't the wackest rap album to come out this year, I don't what is. It's right on that level with KFed's dud. I'm telling you this is so bad I wouldn't even waste my time burning a friend's copy for free, (which is what I usually do when I feel like the album is only so-so and the artist doesn't deserve my hard earned money) Anyway if you want something experimental like this was supposed to be, get Justin Timberlake's album. It's different in a good way. Now while I respect the businessman Diddy, the rapper Diddy should just go bury himself. To sum up: Don't buy this ish."
2,Was really let down...,"I was lookin forward to this cd for awhile, but after I bought it I realized that I made a mistake. The beats are horrible, his lyrica ability is awful, and what is with the love/break up songs?? DO yourself a favor Diddy and stick to the club songs. I'd say theres 4 maybe 5 good songs out of 19..."
4,Better than I expected,"I really did enjoy this CD. I have never been a big fan of Puffy, P-Diddy or whatever his name is today. However, I loved the song ""Tell Me"", so I decided to check the entire CD.Overall, the songs were diverse and made me want to ""shake it"". My only complaint is Diddy's useless commentary between the songs, which is so irritating and unnecessary. Now if Diddy perhaps had a sexy voice, it would work but his lazy speech at times just grates on my nerves. Next time, I hope Diddy keeps his comments to himself."
1,WORST DIDDY ALBUM EVER!!!!!!!,I USUALLY LIKE PUFFY/PUFF/DIDDY WHATEVER THE F___ c HE CALLS HIMSELF MUSIC. BUT THIS ALBUMS SUCKS!!!! HIS VOICE IS SO GODDAMN MONOTONE.HYS LYRICS ARE WACK** GIVE ME MY $13.00 BACK* I WANT A REFUND. ONLY DECENT SONG IS #7(TELL ME FEAT. C. AGUILERA) OTHER THAN THAT THIS ALBUM SUCKS DO NOT BUY IT!! SPREAD THE WORD.....LONG LIVE TUPAC & BIGGIE***QUE CHINGE A SU MADRE EL QUE ME OIGA**
5,Love him Hate him Love it Hate it: It's all good.,"This CD is a fine example of what Diddy does best. You have to want THAT to enjoy this.If you are easily offended by audacious bragging from people you probably wouldn't like in person, then you will hate all of this, because some parts will really irritate you. But, if you're like me, and you have a huge music collection that attempts comprehension, then you must collect with objectivity. Thus, this is a fine example of Diddy doing his collaborative thing, possibly a MASTER CLASS.Bravo to him and his many guests. Oh yeah! This is best used for a party setting except, of course, you are a true fan of R&B; and HipHop, Diddy-style."
1,"real Badd,Press Stop","the Production on here ain't bad,but when Puffy's attempt at rapping&also singing,then the results aren't gonna be good. Puffy is a better talent scout&also at putting folks together,but as a Artist he leaves alot to be desired. this album is only half way worth listening because of some of the guests,but then again there is nothing here that is memorable. Puffy should have stopped a long time ago trying to make records.it's one thing behind the scenes or in the background,but on the mic dude is still wack."
1,"I'd give this C.D. ZERO Stars, if that were possible...P. Silly","really needs to focus on recruiting and producing talent. An absolute AWFUL C.D.Does P Silly have any friends in his life, you know, the kind who are bruatally honest who will pull him to the side and really tell him the truth.ALSO, if I here that god awful song last nigh one more time, I'm gonna hurl. P. Silly must be paying radio stations to play this garbage."
3,"I've waited 4 soooo long, but now....","I've been waiting for this album over a month,I know diddy is the master of productions.But now, after I got the album, it's not that good.When it comes to diddy I don't really listen to his words cause I know he is just a good beat maker, not a true ""keep it real"" rapper.""Come to me"" is the only song I liked, the rest of them are less then good.I don't think we'll be hearing them in our rap clubs in Israel.I'll be waiting for his next release, hoping for the best.G.N"
1,Once you press play you want ask for a refund,"I decided to listen to this album and I realized that I was deeply disappointed. I adore artists like Christina Aguilera who managed to crank a good single but the rest of the album is boring. This artist should retire to the background and stay there. Unlike M.C. Hammer he can't dance, his popularity is market/MTV driven and his ghetto songs have no depth. The album has some great production but Diddy's poor rap skills overpower some of the tracks. Do not press play and save your money for Akon's album ""Konvicted""."
2,Expected More....,"You know.. I guess I can't get over the fact that Bad Boy will never be the same as it was in the 90s. The talent level has done a 180.. Compare the old days of BB.. BIG, The Lox, Faith, Total, Mase, Puffy, hell even Black Rob.. Though some of them were more talented than others, they all had the production that bad boy came to be known for.Where are the beats and sounds that made Diddy who he is now? They're gone.. Plain and simple. He definitely is never going to be a great hiphop artist, but the least he can do is have PERFECT production on his own album. There are maybe 2 tracks on the whole thing that make you want to nod your head.. that's it.Look at Kanye... to me he isn't the best hip hop artist of today. His style is somewhat mediocre, but the albums are put together so well that they end up being damn near perfect."
1,:-(,"Dear Puff Daddy (or P-Diddy, or Diddy, or whatever you call yourself) --You have enough money. Please go away.Thanks."
1,19 reasons why he should remain in the background,"p doofy has to be raps corniest rapper.oops,my bad.k-fed is mo def cornier."
2,Garbage,Diddy needs to stick to everything but music...sometimes what gets your foot into the door is not what you are best at. Thankfully he has evolved to other things. The album sucks outright and there is not other way around that. The beats are hot and the collabos are sick but Diddy ruins the album. I found myself whincing when he started rapping and looking forward to the collaborations instead. His rhymes are just weak and this is worthy of a download only. Maybe not even that much. Wasted beats. Hot cover and title though...
2,Dont press ANYTHING,"Leave it int he CD wrapper and take it back.""Press Play"" is an exact mirror of just how wack the state of hip hop is. Okay, it's not fair to label this a true hip-hop album and I can't bear to even label this a rap album. Diddy is a ""popular"" producer/entertainer. With that in mind, I can see his album doing well as a ""pop"" album.Personally, I don't like it. I pressed play...then skip, skip a few more times, rewind, then skipped a few more times.I'll give it another spin in a week or two."
2,I waited this long for this?,"the most disappointing so far in the 'popular culture and philosophy' series, these essays have little to do with either LotR or Philosophy in the traditional sense, instead attempting to cover everything from environmentalism to narrative structure. As a general format, the authors state their intentions to mold Tolkien's world to their own pet ideas and quote profusely while saying little that convinces. One of the essays even admits that the Buddist parallels it's spent the last few pages proposing are clearly ""superficial"" - why waste the print, then? Another oddity here is a collection of quotes by various noted philosophers that have nothing to do with either the themes in LotR, or, in many cases, the topics the essays address. Extremely discouraging."
4,an interesting mix of viewpoints here,"In this Popular Culture series, this is one of the better editions. The mix of approaches to Tolkien gives a broad range of ideas, and most of them are well thought out and presented. The intent here is not scholarly exegesis, which you can get in many other books. This is Tolkien looked at from a more general viewpoint, which is still a valid way to approach the books of Middle-earth. I don't have any problem recommending this collection of essays."
5,Fascinating Ideas,I recently used this book as a reference in my research project for The Fellowship of the Ring and am really glad I found it on the shelf in my library. The ideas expressed in the essays are diverse and knowledgable. This book is a great way to learn about the Lord of the Rings and understand it at the same time!
2,Blah,"I'll admit that I haven't finished this book, but it's also worth noting that I don't intend to. The essays I've read so far were not very interesting (or, for that matter, very well-written), and I have little hope for the remaining ones. What I had hoped for was a book that would use Tolkien's Trilogy to illustrate philosophical themes. What I got was more like a bunch of writers reviewing the boks in question, and occasionally commenting on some ""(not-so) deep meaning"". It just got too boring after a while.I tried to stick with it. I really did. But sometimes the only way to preserve your sanity is to quit."
5,A magnificent work,"I just discovered John Adams recently, and have heard only a few of his works. I picked up this album from my local library. I was extremely impressed by the scope of this work. For all practical purposes, it is a symphony that compares favorably with any of William Schuman's symphonic works. The beginning reminds me of a Bruckner symphony -- and much of the first movement is positively Brucknerian, albeit it is a Bruckner that has an expressionistic style. The second movement reminds me in spots of late Mahler -- especially that long extended dissonant chord, which can also be heard in M10. The last movement is charming, and probably the most enjoyable movement of this work. All in all, I am tremendously impressed to realize that this music was composed when Adams was a mere 38 years old. A magnificent work."
4,Great Fit!,"The product is perfect for my Toshiba 14.1"" laptop. There was no neoprene odor as stated in some reviews. Very happy with this product."
5,Love It!,I had looked all over for a case to fit my 14.1 Vaio laptop before finding this one on the Amazon site. It is perfect! It fits my laptop like a glove and made slipping it into my carry-on bag a breeze. This was the perfect solution for traveling with my laptop as it helps to protect it while I can still carry the bag of my choice.
1,Size doesn't match my laptop,This sleeve only match 14.1' standard screen. It doesn't match my laptop 14.1' widescreen. I have returned it to Amazon. I hope they can process it as soon as possible.
2,Beware copy protection,"Great CD for all C. Crow fans. HOWEVER, if you plan to convert this CD to MP3 files, forget it. Like two other CD's just purchased from this site, it is copy protected and cannot be ripped to MP3's. My rating reflects my frustration with having a CD that is useless for my purpose."
5,amazing!,the very best of sheryl crow is amazing.Picture is one of my favorite songs ever and each song on this cd is just as good as the next.a must have.
4,Love her songs,"I bought this cd because of the song ""The First Cut Is The Deepest."" I love that song and when i listened to the whole cd. I didn't realize how many songs I recognized here. I mean just listening to the radio and not paying attention i had heard most of these songs. I also LOVE ""My Favorite Mistake"" which I dedicated to a friend of mine. i had also loved her ""Leaving Las Vegas"" song when she first came out. ""Picture"" is another story. Since this song came out everyone and their dog listen to this song so I am kinda tired of it but maybe in the future I'll remember it and fall in love again with it. Maybe ha ha"
3,Not Compelling If You Have Her Other CDs,"Let's start with the new material. ""The First Cut Is The Deepest"" is a nice song, but did we really need a country version too? I am not a Kid Rock fan, and Sheryl is not enough to make up for that on ""Picture"". ""Light In Your Eyes"" is ok, but not what I would expect on *The Very Best Of*.To make this a little more interesting to the longtime fans, I would suggest the following changes:Add - ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" (Soundtrack version), ""Run, Baby, Run"", ""Anything But Down"", and ""C'Mon, C'Mon"".Subtract - ""I Shall Believe"", ""The Difficult Kind"", ""There Goes The Neighborhood"", and ""The First Cut Is The Deepest"" (Country Version).Based on the above suggestions, I feel that ""Sheryl Crow"" was the only CD that was properly represented.If you don't have all of the other CDs, this is not a bad collection. Otherwise, I'd skip it."
1,OVERRRATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I swore i would never waste my time trashin an artist but i dont get her success!All I wanna do is a lame attempt at tryin to be cool and strong enough might be the stupidest song ever written!Im shocked David Baerwald had anything to do w that garbage!She tries to come off so cool but shes a no talent skank!
2,"Not Bad, Not Good","I think that if you like this type of music that is fine.I donnot esp. like this album.I think that the rhymes were really easy and the material was a little too repeatitive but the beats are ok (for those of you that like this type of music)I thought it was a little mid-life crisis meets runaway from reality meets hey I'm still a cool hip person thats down with the lingo in mid-west suburbia.I don't have TOO much against this,but if you are under the age of 35 and reading this go pick up some Rage Against The Machine."
2,Not a Sheryl Crow fan,"Well, I like the song ""I shall believe"" and that's why I purchased this Album, but it would have been better to buy just the single."
2,BORING,Like Sheryl Crow. I suppose I like the stuff not on the radio more than what is played on the radio. Feel like I wasted my money.
5,Awesome CD!,"I bought this CD because I'd heard a Sheryl Crow song I liked on the radio. I didn't realize how many songs she had recorded that I liked. I fell in love with several songs! She has so much variety in her voice, and an awesome range. I just bought tickets to her current concert tour."
2,Are we...ubiquitous?,"To the best of my knowledge, all Sheryl Crow has really done is that ""All I Wanna Do"" thing (which, I will admit, DOES have kind of a neat chord progression: that ""C"" to ""E"" to ""A"" riff IS sort of...well, it gets your attention, anyway...). And she is awfully pretty, too. But - honesty time - that's where it begins and ends. I mean, LaToya Jackson was/is an astoundingly beautiful woman, BUT... She, and Sheryl, don't have much anything to say (at ALL), but they milk that ""pretty face"" bone dry. I saw Ms. Crow yesterday doing a rather embarassing duet of that Tim Hardin song, ""If I Were A Carpenter"" with Willie Nelson, and she ""performed"" ""Honky Tonk Women"" with the Stones on that HBO Special in January, but both times...ehh....I sought my guitar player's insight into this matter (he owns a CD store; I reckon the two give him a sort of credibility), and Kent replied, ""Well, she's real pretty, I'll give ya that. But...man...don't she have a boyfriend or somethin' to keep her home?"""
1,Please STOP!,"Sheryl, this a request for you to please stop making music. It's over. You and Lenny Kravitz need to stop rehashing everything that has come before. Your deal with the devil has got to be over by now. Thank you for your time."
1,CD practically Worthless,"Agree with others. In this day and age of iPods and MP3 players fewer and fewer people use ""CD players"". CD's have become a convenient storage medium to move music to your Computer Stereos and portable listening devices. This CD is worthless in that respect. They may as well put it on vinyl."
3,Missing a few things,"While Sheryl is tremendous & I adore her, this ""greatest hits"" collection is missing a few things....CD - ""Anything But Down"" (a great rock out song) and the James Bond ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" theme.DVD - the other video for ""A Change Will Do You Good."" Where is the colorful & fun version with Ellen Degeneres??? Instead we get a boring B&W version."
3,good collection to own,I'm not really a fan of sheryl crow's but I remember enjoying several of her popular hits over the past 10 years and for that alone getting this CD is worth it cause I would rather own it for the songs I liked which are all on this instead of buying all her albums. Wildflower is a nice CD to own though in addition to her hits.
5,Sheryl is true talent,"This is a great collection of some of Sheryl's best known songs, though I wouldn't necessarily call them her greatest. Any how, this album is brilliant from start to finish. There's no filler material here. Sheryl is a genuine artist who consistantly makes great music. Give her take of Cat Steven's ""The First Cut Is The Deepest"" a listen and I know she will rope you in too!"
4,"""I promised you I'd never give up...""","The Very Best of Sheryl Crow is a good, solid collection of this wonderful singer/songwriters best work. Songs like If It Makes You Happy, Home, Everyday is a Winding Road, All I Wanna Do, Steve McQueen, and Picture are great songs. There are two new songs Light in your Eyes (a fantastic song by the way) and Cat Steven's The First Cut is the Deepest. I like Sheryl, she has written some amazing pop/rock songs. Buy this cd today!"
4,Finally!,"The Very Best of Sheryl Crow cd solved a problem of mine. I really like the song Picture (with Kid Rock.) No music site offered a cd, single or otherwise under his name. I was finally able to get the cd at a reasonable price & finally have a copy of one of my favorite songs."
4,Great Collection,"This cd is perfect for someone like me who never bought a cd of hers but likes her. I was very pleased with all the songs selected, I think they are great. Although songs that were hits are not included you get gems like Picture with Kid Rock which is a big surprise. I wish I had gotten the one with the dvd but they did not have it where i went so i have just the cd but it is a great cd to do stuff around the house with. So grab a copy if you do not have her cds, you will find yourself singing along to more songs than you think. ALso there are two versions of her new song The First Cut Is The Deepest. This is her great new remake which is breaking through on radio and will song be a classic. Get this cd and vote for me :)"
3,Hit&Miss but all you will every need by Her,"I respect Sheryl Crow's Talent but I have never been that big on her.Her Material fits well with Radio&She has had cuts like ""My Favorite Mistake"",""All I wanna Do"",""Everyday is a Winding Road""&""Soaking up the Sun"" that are fun Cuts but beyond that She doesn't do much for me vocally.Lyrics have some moments.Her 94 Album ""Tuesday Night Music Club"" is about the closes thing by Her that I dig slightly more than Half way.this for me covers Her Career fully."
4,S.Crow Album,"The album is as I had expected. It did arrive much faster than I had expected. So, I'm happy."
3,Derailed by production and mastering,"I have problems with this album. The material selection is okay, though I'd image Sheryl Crow fans would make some substitutions. My problems are in the production and mastering. The production depends too much on gimmicky sonic tricks, like phasing and fuzztone. The mastering was done so ""hot"" (read loud) that the music has no subtlety. Who would have guessed that ""Picture,"" produced by Kid Rock, would be the most tasteful song on the disc? Most of the rest is reminiscent of listening to a jackhammer. Be forewarned!"
4,Crow's Nest,This is a good and complete compilation of Crow's hits to the date of release of the album. A good summary of her work for those who just want 1 Cheryl CD. The album seems very much a piece of 90s culture.
3,"Not Bad,But...","Not a Bad album-in fact for the Most part,it's pretty Good...but the Subaru ad's murdered any liking I've ever had for ""Every Day is a Winding Road""-now,when I hear it,my first impulse is to curse and hit the Mute button. Thanks,Subaru..."
4,Solid,"I can rarely say that a pre-packaged Best-of is good and complete, but this one is. Most Best-ofs leave off a couple songs so you still have to buy an album or get them elsewhere. I don't feel I need to buy anthing else of hers since this seems complete."
4,Spend The X-tra Cash.....,"If you only want one Sheryl Crow album, purchasing this cd is the way to go. All of her best music is on this disc. But my advice is to spend a little extra cash (even go into the zShop) and buy her first 4 studio albums instead. I always find greatest hits albums a little pretentious, especially when the artist only has 2 or 3 ""legitimate"" hits."
1,"WARNING/THE BEST SONG/SONG#11 PICTURE, WITH KID ROCK...............","WILL MYSTERIOUSLY NOT DOWN LOAD ON TO YOUR COMPUTER!!!!!! WHAT IS UP WITH THAT? It is on the cd but you cannot download it. IT SKIPS FRON SONG#10 TO SONG # 12. Another reviewer complained that he bought the mp3 version and it was mysteriously missing, making it a ripoff. But even if you buy the actually cd, tho it is on the cd, it will not download either. For this reason alone, one star. :("
5,Great easy-listening tunes,"I once saw Sheryl Crow singing a duet with Paverotti (sp?). I noticed that God didn't exactly bless her with the voice of an operatic diva, BUT as a singer of great melodic pop tunes, she ranks way up there. She's a very good singer and an excellent songwriter. About a half-dozen songs on this album are so good, it's almost impossible to pick a favorite.David Rehakauthor of ""A Young Girl's Crimes"""
5,a beautiful retrospective for an (equally) beautiful musician....,"Sheryl Crow was perhaps one of the definitive voices of the 1990s through the early 2000s, and is definitely a wonderful tour de force performer today. THE VERY BEST OF SHERYL CROW gives us a look (and listen) at some of her most well-known (and well-loved) songs from her repertoire. The album gets started on a rousing and upbeat note with ""All I Wanna Do,"" one of her first hits from 1993. This song always puts me in a disco dance floor/jukebox bar mode, from the first hook. Other great numbers on this album include ""Soak Up the Sun,"" and Crow's tender cover of ""The First Cut is the Deepest."" Of course, this is only the icing on the cake. There are too many hits to mention here. Highly recommended."
4,Traveler,"I first saw this movie on a British Airways flight and don't think it was ever released in the U.S. Rhys Ifans' comic genious is now well known to U.S. audiences and is matched by Eileen Walsh in this film. The film begins with the unique premise of Walsh's father (yes, father) dying in during childbirth, her mother who refuses thereafter to leave her house and the tales the daughter weaves to bring the world to her mother ... and then, the consequences of unleashing that imagination on the world when the daughter moves away to London to work. Really a very fine and entertaining film."
2,Janice Beard,"This was one of the most boring movies I've ever tried to watch, and in fact, was watching it with someone who agreed with me. ""Janice Beard"" - and what was the point? Should have left her out, and just had Rhys Ifans."
1,"Track listing, anyone?","This isn't a review, but could someone please give me a track listing? I'd like to know what I'm getting before I buy it....."
1,What the hell are you talking about....,"Dr. Seuss be specific whether you have heard this cd or not...leave mother love bone alone...if you have heard this double disc write about it...be sure to mention tracks, we would like to know!"
5,check this out,I just want to say that if you are one of the lucky ones to get this box set. Enjoy it! It is a great production by the frontrunner in rock bands. It features some of the best work to never be noticed
1,What a waste of a good concept!,"I don't know who that other reviewer works for, maybe a EA Sports marketer, but I find it hard to believe he actually played (raced) this game. The idea of the game and its elements is great, but the execution of them was abysmal and will lead to many CD ROM's being smashed on the corner of computer desks."
5,Accept no substitution!,"Let me brief with you: This stuff works.If you're the person who will be up until 3AM with severe heartburn, then this is the product for you. Compare it to anything else you buy in the store, and I highly doubt you'll find similar ingredients. If you can, buy the real stuff (Mint is best) and keep it close to you for when heartburn hits.You con compare this to any other liquid antacid on the market and Gaviscon will laugh it out of the park. This stuff works in SECONDS. It doesn't taste too bad (trust me, no comparison to the chalky, watery store-brand liquid antacid) and it's just so much faster than Tums and Alka Seltzer. While you can't take it with you, this stuff is probably the best liquid antacid on the market, hands down.The only caveat is it only works best when you are not eating or planning to eat for an hour or so, so save it for bedtime indigestion. You can thank me later."
3,Not for beginners,"For experienced XML developers, the book may be useful as a reference. However, I cannot recommend it as a tutorial. The book goes into far too much arcane detail about subjects such as character sets (UNICODE, etc...), entity and attribute naming conventions, and so forth; while giving examples somewhat short shrift. It does not develop topics from the simple to the complex - rather, it examines each topic in mind-boggling detail, with the result that one has not digested the basics of a topic before being overwhelmed with the specifics.Perhaps as I gain experience with XML this book will become more useful, but for now I'll be looking for a more basic reference.Sean"
1,Incredibly Confusing and Unorganized,"....but with 12 authors what would you expect. You get to a part where it seems important information is about to be revealed and then the author(s) write that we'll get to that later. Example code is horrible and does not track well with the book. For instance, where is interactive.xsl?"
2,Good Content but poor Examples,"This book covers XML and the related Technologies reasonably in depth but the examples are disappointing. Most of the chapters in this book use one XML file, I repeat, just one file! - a ""book catalog"" to base the examples. And some of them revolve around a similar file - again related to ""book catalog"".The book also contains yet another unfocused chapter from the authors of Pro. XML with servlets and JSP. A web portal to buy stamps of a couple of European countries using US currency 8-<If you are looking for some case studies of applications that use XML, buy Applied XML Solutions."
3,Too many irons in the fire,"The book covers too many topics and just few are developed in deep while others are superficially introduced because not yet standardized at the time of print. The book claims it covers the following topics: XML, XSLT, DOM, DTD, SOAP, XLink, XPointer, XPath, WAP, WML...and more; but just XML, Schemas, DTDs and SOAP could almost fit the book's size.Chapters don't follow a very logic thread and it doesn't deal enough with very relevant subjects. Wrox probably planned to make this book the XML bible but I think they are far from the target."
5,"At last, a book with some thought behind it.","I get tired of books which are poorly annotated, cut and paste jobs of specifications I can get on the Web with fancy titles that promise a whole lot and deliver little.I bought this book because it shows how XML can solve architectural problems that exist with some Web technologies. These guys have put into the book a lot of thinking that you won't pick up from a spec or some other dry books on the subject.Full marks for their easy writing style which gives meaning and interest to something that is really quite boring.I have bought other books on XML which will probably keep me warm this winter for a while.I'd recommend this book to everyone."
3,"gets the point across, but too wordy and poorly edited","The book does an effective job of explaining XML concepts. I have no prior experience in XML (some HTML, though), but the book is understandable. I do have to reread some sections which are poorly phrased or poorly explained.As with another Wrox book that I've used, Professional XML is far too wordy. The book isn't well edited either. Its twelve authors repeat coverage of some material in different chapters.All in all, it's an okay book, but I prefer the O'Reilly books to the Wrox ones."
4,Good reference book!,The first book I read that give me ideas of what I can do with XML. This is more a reference than a tutorial but this is what I was looking for.
1,Boring Book.!,"This is a very boring book. Chapters look like well organized, but content inside is mass and hard to follow. Don't buy this book."
1,"too much M$, too primitive","This book is horrible, too much IE5 loving. Has no or very little XSL references, but has a couple of chapters exclusively por IE5. Otherwise, it's too primitive a book, and doesn't allow to extend knowledges. Has interesting appendixes, however"
5,"<Stars Comment=""I couldnt give six"">Five</Stars>",This book is the most advanced and readable work I have ever read on this field. Thanks to it I am making a lot of money and now I have an SLK roadster. The bad thing is that with so much wind on my head I'm getting bald like a snooker ball...
3,"Good reference book, not a learning one","I've found this book very hard to understand as a first book on XML. If you know what XML is about but are looking for practical real-life exemples, look elsewhere. If you know XML and want to know everything about it's internal work and how to work with DTD, that would be your book.I've also ordered the Professional XML IE5 Programmer's Reference at the same time and this book gave me an overview of what I can do with XML on the Internet and THEN I had an idea of what to do of the Professional XML book.You have to ask you those questions : Do I need to know how to show XML with XSL, ASP, DHTML, HTML? If yes, look elsewhese first. Do I need an XML reference to know how to create XML files? If yes, look no further."
3,ATTN: unix/java engineers -- way too much IE/VBScript/MS!,"I guess I expected that a platform independent standard such as XML would have been better expained using a platform independent language such as java. For the unix/java engineers out there....this book contains much useful information and don't get me wrong, I learned a lot. The question is, would I have learned as much or possibly more if I didn't have to put up with 90% of the code examples written in VBScript? Many examples require Internet Explorer. Content was up-to-date and informative but somewhat repetative (12 authors)."
3,Good but too MS,"The book is pretty good but don't think you'll get too much Java with XML. This book focuses more on MS technologies, the examples uses JScript and ASP so if you're a Java man it's not very worthwhile."
1,terrible-do not buy!!,This has almost nothing to do with the making of Westworld. There are two sections (which use the same footage) covering robots and robots in movies and a list of Yul Brunner's films. The quality of the film is horrible and the color so washed out as to make it almost colorless.
2,"Well, there's nothing more that I could add that wasn't already said for a review here","The first half is about Yul Brunner films. The second half is about movies with robots. The only thing that does connect these two separate short documentaries are that of the actor Yul Brunner himself is involved with both through Westworld.This is really nothing more interesting than something you'd probably see on PBS sometime around three in the morning. I can't believe that this is actually a DVD for sale to the public. I'd find only a collection of Palmolive or Charmin bathroom tissue commercials more interesting to own as a DVD than this bore of a documentary.I love the movie ""Westworld"" and most all the films of Michael Crichton (except Jurassic Park, I don't know why I can't get into that film), but this documentary (and how it was titled) really made me feel deceived by my remotely candid expectation. I want my 48 wasted minutes back."
1,Misleading!,"As a fan of the Westworld movie I eagerly bought this, only to find that it barely has anythind to do with it. There is a look at Yul Bryner's film career which was interesting but mostly irrelevant to the title. There are two sections (which use the same footage) covering robots and robots in movies. The actual part covering the movie was so short that it passed in the blink of an eye. I really felt like I had picked something up from a market stall that had been knocked together in someone's back bedroom. I wouldn't touch this with a bargepole!"
5,Amazing wool sweater,"It is an amazing warm sweater, It is coming with good fit, comfortable and suitable to wear alone and also with underwear shirts."
3,Not a Crime Story,"The neighborhood of the 60s and 70s was a safety net. You knew the people who lived around you; you knew their schedules; you knew their idosyncrasies. All because these people were so much like you. It was a predictable and comfortable life.But if that safety net was ripped apart, you found how completely different your neighbors were from you.And this is what 9-year-old Marsha discovers the summer a boy is murdered in her neighborhood. Suddenly crime and betrayal surround her. The unfamiliar invites invention and Marsha creates a murder scenario that falsely accuses the neighborhood's newcomer.This is a good story, but the style of telling it denies the reader the thrill of suspense and discovery. Events are introduced not to foreshadow, but to tell the outcome. Early on, page 8 to be exact, we learn that the murder is never solved. Though this is not the story of a crime, this detail spoils the underlying story of Marsha's invention."
4,Good book!,I liked this book. It is an engaging look into the powerful effect a deserting father has on a young girl's life. Read it!
3,We anxiouslly await Berne's next work.,Although much of Berne's novel could be improved upon - I wonder why the book wasn't a bit longer and had developed certain themes more in-depth - it was entertaining and very well-written. Ms. Berne has a fine career ahead of her. I'm sure it is only a matter of time before Oprah provides Berne's apotheosis.
5,Mr. Green is everywhere,"I know this neighborhood as if I'd lived in it all my life. What goes on behind those curtains on summer nights, the scent and taste of being young and on the brink of everything, including danger.It's all here in this book. I can't stop thinking about these people. Mr. Green is everywhere in every neighborhood. I loved it."
5,A great summer (or any other time of the year) read.....,"As the head of a network of book groups in the Boston area, we recommended this book to our groups. They all loved it, without exception. Both a deeply satisfying mystery and a masterful psychological portrait of a young girl, this novel is a wonderful read"
3,Waited for a revelation that didn't appear,"THis novel draws you in with a creepy murder and excellent characterizations of a family in turmoil. I was disappointed that the plot was pretty simple in the end, and that what was revealed was obvious all along."
2,Accusations,Long story short: Don't be a false witness. Moses also cautioned against this at the mount. Was hoping for something a bit more original.
2,Keep Looking!,"While I did finish this book, It never had a climax...it just went and went and went without a rise and fall :(. This book could have been soo much better if it just had something dramatic happen towards the end of the book. Anything would have been better, then nothing ever happening! And I would have liked to know more about Mr. Green at the end of the book, like how did he get that mermaid tatoo after all?!"
4,Thoroughly enjoyable,"A Crime in the Neighborhood is a thoroughly enjoyable coming of age story with a twist. While this is not a ""whodunnit"" (and those of you looking for one will be disappointed), a murder does figure prominently in the storyline. Our story takes place in 1972 with 10 year old Marsha narrating. Her father has run off with her Aunt, her mother is at her wits end, her twin siblings are getting into trouble, and a neighborhood boy has been murdered. I could especially relate to the time and feel of this story as I too was a ten year old girl in 1972. I remember just as in the novel when everyone knew their neighbors and no one locked their doors. But times are changing and the murder signals an end of innocence in Marsha's life and the world around her. This is a well written story with an extremely realistic feel; I could picture this neighborhood so clearly in my head it was as if I had actually been there. Seek this novel out, it's well worth your time to read."
5,Start here and you can't go wrong,"This is Jim Church's answer to those who say that you must have a ""God given eye"" to take great photographs. Jim is above all a teacher. His ability to bring complex ideas down to the level where a novice can comprehend is legendary. His method, rather unique in the world of underwater photography and videography, is not to show you great stuff and say ""beat this"", but to start with basic principles and work you through until you are automatically seeing the right solution to the situation before you. I would bet that any ""name"" underwater photographer if asked ""where do I start?"" would answer ""pick up Jim Church's books and read them 3 or 4 times then get in the water."". This book, at less than the cost of 2 rolls of underwater film and developing, should be considered mandatory reading for anyone with a desire to take photographs (or video) underwater."
4,6th Grade Teacher,"Excellent book for lit groups. Students will be hooked fast--with in 20 pages. I couldn't put it down...it brought me to tears right along with Janey. In my experience, the books that can generate emotion are hits with my students."
3,OK single.,"This CD single for the 1998 High Llamas release Cold and Bouncy contains the title track ""The Sun Beats Down"" as well as the previously un-released non-album tracks ""Stop Trainer"" and ""Showstop"" (Op Art Informal)."" The title track is quite impressive and at times is my favorite High Llamas tune (at least of the ones that have lyrics). The tracks that back it are OK. This item is recommended for High Llamas completists and other collectors."
5,Soooo Beautiful!!!!,This crib set is very beautiful. Besides not being all pink it is very classy and elegant(made for a true princess) it is very pratical. Most crib sets you cannot use the quilt because they are so stiff but with the vintage teaberry blanket it is soft and can actually be used(nice to know when your spending that kind of money on it).
2,Cheaply made,"If you're a fan of the original Wendy Bellissimo line, before she sold out and mass produced, you won't be impressed. The quality of the fabric and workmanship is marginal, very disappointing, but you get what you pay for!"
4,This is GORGEOUS!,"I don't agree with all the other reviews. I saw this bedding in the store first and thought it was beautiful! My daughter is 4 months old and I haven't found anything I have liked yet because everything is so babysish or too bright or too pastel. I saw this and knew that this was the one I wanted for her room. I thought the colors were perfect, very elegant and tasteful! My only complaint is that I think it is too high priced for Babies R US so that's why I gave it 4 stars."
2,"Beautiful But,","Unlike some reviewers, I don't question the quality of the fabrics or the colors. This is a beautiful set. The colors and fabric aare awesome, but the blanket is small and thin. It is barely big enough to cover the crib mattress. And it is soooo thin. It is basically two pieces of fabric sewn together with a ruffle. There is not any batting or anything in the middle to give it any substance. It was a great disappointment."
4,Adorable,"I found the bedding online before it was available in the stores and was so excited! Then after it became available and saw what people were saying I was bummed, but went and looked at it anyways and cant understand what they were talking about! It isnt the least bit wrinkled or rough, its smooth and soft. I am very happy with my decision and cant wait to put my little girl in her new crib! The only downfall is the price, its way to expensive but like someone else said the coupon definatley helped. Also a little frustrated with how the release dates keep moving up."
1,Way 2 much for the quality,"This wasn't my first baby and usually we buy the baby bedding sets for less than $200. When I saw this online I decided to break my rule and purchased the set. What a big mistake. The quality as others have said is not the best and its really sad because this is the most expensive set at Babies R US, and although when I first saw it in a catalog they described it as ""affordable"" which for most people it isn't. To pay $300 for just a 4 pc set is rediculous and you can get better deals and better quality by going with Kidsline. Test the quality before you buy, and before you place any of the bedding on your registry or you will regret it later. Its true what they say the colors are much different online and in catalogs than it is in real life."
5,check bigger babies r us stores for this set!,From researching this set myself I have come to find out that the smaller towns will carry a few of the items but your bigger cities' stores or more affluent communites' stores carry all the extras we moms & grandmas are craving for this set. Those stores seem to know also what is coming out soon & how many are in stock compared to the website. I believe you can do a phone order & pay the shipping which may be a lot faster than the website.Can't believe I'm actually going to order the chandelier!!! ha ha
3,not sure what to do,"I loved this bedding online but was somewhat disappointed when I saw it in the store. I guess it is so different from all of the baby-ish lines that I didn't have realistic expectations. I haven't decorated anything yet, I'm still on the fence, but I think I'll go for it. It is very vintage and ""shabby chic"", but definitely see it in person before registering to make the final decision."
5,This is the perfect bedding set,"When I was pregnant with my daughter I looked at every bedding set on the market and when I saw this one in Babies R Us I fell in love with it. I had to have it. I can't tell you how beautiful it looks with dark wood furniture. The set up in Babies R Us had it with a white crib which really did not capture the soft colors. I washed it and it came out brand new. I put it on the crib and I love it even more. My baby lays in the crib and looks at the flowers on the bumper. This set is the perfect mix between girly and not over the top. I hate really baby looking things and I am so glad the this came out in time for my baby's arrival. I was able to find so many accesories at other stores that were much cheaper than the ones in Babies R Us like the wall art and lamp. I found a lamp in Target from the Shabby Chic line that matched so perfectly. The only other things that I purchased were the pillow for my Glider Rocker, the basket with the striped liner and the pink frame."
3,"Beautiful, but disappointed w/ ordering accessories","I bought this set before it came to Babies'R Us, which I love. It has washed great and it is so pretty. The fabrics are high quality and soft. However, when I ordered the valances through this web site, it took over three months to even figure out what happened to my order, and then they just failed to fill it without notifiying me (Wendy B. and Babies R Us, NOT Amazon - I got great service from Amazon). They finally told me to just give up on it becasue they did not know when, if ever, they could get it from W. Bellissimo. Needless to say, I expected much better customer service from a high end designer like W.B. Not very professional at all! A real bummer."
5,Winning Smart after Losing Big,"Move over Dr. Phil! Rob Stearns packed this book with practical advice that explains how to move onward and upward following any type of loss. Mr. Stearns outlines the thought processes and actions that take us from losing to winning. He makes it clear that while losing is a normal part of life, we are not puppets of fate but rather active participants in shaping our own destiny: it is up to us to take responsibility for our own actions and turn our losses into wins. This book tells us how in a conversational, no-nonsense, non-preachy style."
5,WINNING SMART AFTER LOSING BIG,"We're often taught that losing is a natural part of life, but we're not usually tutored in what to do after a loss has occurred. Mr. Stearns examines different types of loss, both personal and professional, and presents a clear course for moving forward positively, whatever the loss source. Insightful and touching anecdotes add texture to this fine read. I am already thinking and acting a lot ""smarter"" as inevitable loss touches my life."
4,My Review,"Its a pretty cool game, only that i cant seem to get the housesand industrial areas and the commercial areas to get built.Otherwise, i like it."
3,Not Sure Yet,According to a lot of Sim City hard core players Sim City 2000 is better than the New Sim City 4 minus graphics.So I'll have wait and see if they are right.
1,"No Instructions, Poor graphics, a waste of money","This program reminds me of my old Atari 2600, only much less fun. There are no useful instructions, the graphics stink, and as far as I can tell the entire game is one dull and repetitious waste of time money and effort. After spending over two hours trying to figure out how it could possibly be enjoyable-I gave up.Save your money-Don't buy this. I wish I could return this product. Or better yet, I wish someone had advised me not to waste money on it, like I am urging you!"
1,Sim City 2000 SE Review,"I thought taht after five minutes this game was boring, but I kept trying because I knew most things get more interesting. However, this was not the case. Don't buy this game it is a waste of money, especially if you are a girl and have better stuff to do. I am not really a negative person but this was really a truly awful game."
1,Irritating Game,"I see some people love this game. I on the other hand, dislike it very much. Mostly because in order to make your city happy, you need money to make the city better. But you run out of money to soon and try to make some adjustments in the taxes and everything, which makes the city unhappy. And while your trying to do all that, the roads keep getting messed up and needing repairs, you have to add more police stations to keep the crime at bay, ect. Plus, if your playing with the crisis', you'll have aliens burning your hard work down, earthquakes, ect. It's just not worth the time. Now if you love a tough challenge and have nothing else you can think of to do, then go right ahead and get it. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money. This is unlike the regular Sims game, which is the best PC game ever. I really can't wait for The Sims 2! Save your money for that one! It will be so much better than the first!"
1,"It looks good, but DON'T buy it!","This game is extremely bad. The only good sim games are the awesome ""The Sims"" games. In SimCity, th only way to build homes, hospitals, airports etc... is to use the urban renewal kit! If you build a city useing the regular game it does not build buildings at all! If you choose to make an area of land residential, it does not build homes, it colors the land green! This game is horrible! When you look at your finished city, it is a huge color coded land mass!"
5,Awesome,This game is SO! COOLLLLLLL!! You can have fun by making your population impossible to control. Everybody should have this Game.
1,Disappointed,It would not install on a Windows 7 Operating System or a ME System.I didn't pay much for it so I am not to upset.
2,Doesn't work for updated computers,This game doesn't work for any system basically made it the past 10 years which is ridiculous considering no one has that old of a system.
4,ok for the price,These laundry taps are ok for the price although they are made in china but will do the job i need
3,I think it could be much better.,"I should start this review by saying I use this for my hermit crabs. They love to climb and they absolutely love this. If they could rate this product, they would give it a 5.For me, this thing is a bit of a difficulty. The suction cups don't work as well as I would like and they have a hard time staying on. If you intend to put anything on it that will weight down the platform, then it has a really difficult time staying up. I actually had to put something beneath it so that it could handle the weight. I imagine that in water that might be a different story, but if you intend to use this for land, that is my experience.The platform was a darker brown than I thought and it def. has a plastic look, however, for the price and purpose that's not a problem and once decorated it looks great! I won't buy another one, but it has done a pretty good job and I don't mind having to put something underneath it."
3,Great item.. but... it's lacking.,"I love the idea of this item. But what they didn't mention for installation is that you have to place it on a DRY tank and then fill the tank very slowly with water. If you do not, algae may grow in between the glass and the suction cups and drop the whole terrace to the bottom of your tank. It's not a fun clean up! hahaOtherwise, GREAT idea, fast shipping, loved the effect I got until the accident.Good luck!"
1,AHHHHH!!,"It keeps crashing, I cant even play. Does any1 kno wut is wrong or how to fix it? I'm running Mac OS 10.3.4 on a g3 ibook with 500 mHz and 384 Megs of ram."
1,AHHHHH!!,"It keeps crashing, I cant even play. Does any1 kno wut is wrong or how to fix it? I'm running Mac OS 10.3.4 on a g3 ibook with 500 mH and 384 Megs of ram."
2,Lame,"The same guy who wrote The Stone Dogs wrote this???Flat characters, uninspired writing, hackneyed dialogue. Stirling definitely phoned this one in."
2,overpriced.,"Over priced, WAY over priced. [...]. They also had arrows and where translucent. The post it flags are much much better, and much cheaper. These are not as good even remotely."
1,SUPERSTAR,"Is it possible to give less than one star for a review? In his pathetic approach at musical success, Bill rips off other established artists (i.e. ""She Don't Come Around Here Anymore""...hmmm, remind you of ""Don't Come Round Here Nomore"" by Tom Petty?!?). Bill should have stuck with his original plan from the past and became Luke Perry. I hope that his self-written reviews will give him happiness, as his sad music sorta depresses anyone else who listens to it. Good luck Mr. Ricchini...I'm gonna go stab myself in the ears now."
5,Exploring the perfect pop song,"Tonight is another subtle and gorgeous CD. Ricchini comes on like a folky Morrissey with a string section-- a hopeless romantic with a seemingly endless supply of timeless melodies that would make Brian Wilson proud. The songs explore human relationships, memory and ultimately finds redemption on the closer ""People"" which is part country ballad, part Disney show tune. I love this guy."
3,Good but derivative,"6 of these 11 tracks sound like direct samples of other songs. However, songs like Cold Comfort show Bill has the ability to muster up a unique track. Sorta shabbybut not too shabby."
1,C'mon now,"This records directly rips off B&S, the shins, the beatles and kermit the frog, all in seperate songs. Nothing original here, just alot of pretentious, yet pretty, string arrangements backdropping way too familiar melodies."
1,Misproduced.,"Bill Ricchini missed out on a chance to make a pretty darn good record. Every string and guitar part is cringeworthy in it's predictability. Just because you put pretty instruments over tracks doesn't mean you don't also need to find inventive ways to use them. The songs themselves are passible (although again predictable) but most of this record has a COMPLETE lack of freshness. I was a fan of the debut but after this listen I'm convinced the ""sophomore slump"" is for real."
5,fast shipment - excellent condition - excellent price,"It was a fast shipment and the book arrived in excellent condition - with excellent price . I would definitely buy from them again, and would recommend to my friends."
4,This is a GREAT book!,"This book is great!I read this book from cover to cover and I still use it ALL the time as a great reference for DataSources, Transaction APIs, etc. The appendixes are more helpful than I could have imagined, they summarize so much stuff that I read in the book, but don't use very often, and have a hard time remembering sometimes. If you are looking for a good book to guide you through ALL the steps of database access with Java, then I highly suggest at the very least sitting down with this book for a while to get the feel of it, and see if it's for you. The book moves at a great pace, spending most of the time covering the basic, everyday, important stuff, but also spending enough time to show how to use some really neat more advanced features. Overall... another great book from WROX!"
4,Survivor left me a little flat,"First of all, I applaud J.D. Robb for coming up with another one of her good books. However, there is something about ""Survivor"" that stops it from being great rather than just good. The storyline is commendable, and the characters even more so, but I found Robb's writing this time around to be rather clipped. It seemed to lack those tiny words--""the"", ""is"", ""it"", and ""if""--that create sentence fluidity and structural understanding. Also, as mentioned by a previous reader, I found Eve Dallas to be much colder than I would have liked, especially towards Nixie herself. I didn't expect her to smother the child, but I'm not too sure I enjoyed seeing this particular side of my favorite heroine. All in all, I did enjoy this book and so I give it four stars."
5,Wonderful,"I love all the books from Nora Roberts, but I love even more the ones that she writes as J D Roob. This one is wonderful!!"
2,Wait for the Paperback,"I seldom buy hardcover mysteries, I read too many of them. But I do buy J. D. Robb in hardcover, and typically think it's worth the price. But not this time. The complexity of plot that we've gotten used to is very much missing from this book. Eve is wooden and ugly and ice cold. The other characters such as Roarke and Peabody are absolutely predictable and boring. We have to endure the dream about Eve's father once again. I hesitate to rail on, because I've gotten so much enjoyment from Robb's other books, and surely everyone's entitled to a dud. So I'll just say if you're a J. D. Robb fan, I know you have to read this book. Just save yourself some money and wait until it comes out in paperback."
2,Please grow up Eve,"I have loved this series since its inception, but now I'm finding myself bored, but I read this one to the end, just to find out who the villains were. We all know Eve had a rough childhood, but now, instead of seeing her as heroic because of all she has overcome, I think she is just selfish and self-absorbed.Ms. Roberts confuses her readers by leading them to think that Nixie might be staying with Eve and Rourke, but then abruptly slams the door on that idea. I was also disturbed and annoyed with the way Eve speaks to Nixie. There is a lot of swearing and at one point Eve tells her to ""Stay there. Stay quiet, or I'm going to beat the crap out of you.""If you must read this, borrow it from the library."
2,Murders in 2059,"After what appeared to be an interesting prologue, the next 100 pages lacked excitment; as did much of the rest of the book. Although there are some interesting events, I thought the book did not flow well. Computer searches may be the way crime is fought in the future, but I prefer more foot work in the street. I also thought there could have been less profanity. It was a bit unrealistic the way the author described the vehicles of the future as they cruise on and above the steets of New York City. To use some of Ms. Roberts (J. D. Robb's) words, I would say the this book was not the ""ult""."
4,Getting back on track,"This installment is a definite improvment over the last two. However, I would agree with a few other reviewers that Eve's abrasiveness is getting trite. Summerset has taken care of an injured Eve, has pushed Roarke to reconcile with her when they fight, and now he has taken on the care of a little girl for her. And yet, Eve still treats him like dirt.I do like the fact that Robb relied more on storyline and plot instead of half-baked declarations of love between Eve and Roarke and/or sex scenes.I enjoyed the story and the interactions that Roarke and Summerset had with Nixie, the nine year old witness that Even is protecting. Eve's dealings with the child were less enjoyable, but she did soften a bit and I really enjoyed seeing that.This is a great addition to the series."
3,I Agree,"I agree with Nicholas' Mom above that the ending left me quite unfulfilled. The book was so intriguing I even missed my train stop once while reading. But there were so many open ends at the end of the book that the only certain thing was that the guys were caught. I expected Eve and Roarke to keep the child at one point, but there was no closure of the ex-wife, the sister in law, Nixie's farewell... I guess I juat wanted and expected more. It really was just the last chapter that was the let-down."
5,EMOTION STIRRING,I read a lot of books every year. I don't cry much over books or often. The fact that this one has moved me to tears is by and of itself a commendation to the power of Ms Roberts writing.
5,Death Books,Another In Death book by JD Robb. Another great book to keep all her characters alive and the future bright.
3,Disappointed,"I normally devour these books in mere hours but this one took me several days. There was just a general lack of feeling by the characters that caused disinterest on my part to hurry towards the end. All of the characters seemed boring to me this go around. Nevertheless, J.D. Robb's worst writing is still better than a lot of mystery writers so I will definitely continue to read these. I may, however, wait for the next one in paperback."
2,Extremely Unappealing 'Heroine',"I guess I'm one of the minority who don't care for this series and set of characters. This was my first 'In Death' book and will be my last. Although nearly all of the characters were unengaging and not likeable, the heroine, Eve Dallas, was right at the top of the list: harsh, nasty, vulgar and very off-putting. And what, oh WHAT is the deal with that amazingly stupid character name Nixie Swisher??! Please!"
2,Damaged,"The audio tape is excellent like the entire ""In Death"" series, but the disc was damaged. Parts throughout were garbled and missed the end for the same reason"
1,Survivor in Death,"the beginning of this book was excellent, but dont be fooled, the first few chapters are the only decent part of this book. the rest of the book is just filled with sex and the ultimate downfall is that there is no foreshadowing to the killers. what's the point of writing it if the reader cant try to figure out who the murderers were. this was one of the worst books i have ever read, i'd call it a trashy romance novel with a hint of mystery. dont waste your time reading it."
3,"3.5 stars - Good, but not her best.","This is a series that should be read in order. But for fans who have read the previous books, this is another fine addition to the series. I didn't feel it was quite as strong as some of the others. It didn't have the same element of humor, nor was the motive for the killings as clear. But Robb never really disappoints and this was another enjoyable, straight-through read."
3,Getting a bit nasty!,"I've read all the 'In Death' novels and started to re read them all after waiting for 'Survivor' to be released in Australia. I'm dissapointed in the fact that Eve is getting nastier and nastier. I empathise with her character that she was abused and struggling with that knowledge and the fact that she killed her father - but for a trained cop (who you would assume would have had grief counselling with her training) handles Nixie fairly rough. Eve was softer as a cop in her first dozen or so books and she keeps getting nastier and more surly. I want to tell her to grow up and stop being such a jerk. Don't get me wrong - I love Eve and all the books. But it seems with every relevation with every book - Eve's attitude and general interaction with - let's face it 'nicer' characters (Peabody, Roarke, McNab) she's coping less and less. Her nasty attitude is leaving me with a bad taste in my mouth."
3,Tall tale,"Macomber Beechum is a Texas millionaire. Dan Roman has bills to pay. Beechum's ranch house is not opulent. Roman is a private detective, former police officer.The problem presented is a missing granddaughter. Her husband contends she went to East Texas with an old boyfriend to visit. She runs the family business. Her father, a twin, committed suicide under mysterious circumstances.Sandra Conrad is subsequently a suspect in the death of her husband Peter when his body is found stuffed down an old well. At this point her sisters, Mercy and Hope Beechum, hire Roman to continue the search for her. Roman has shadowed her travels and believes that she is alive. The dispute the Beechums are having concerns timber rights.Perhaps the Beechums are poor in spirit. Roman runs into some quick draw artists, perfecting their gun drawing skills for years in a haze of nostalgia for the days of the Texas Rangers. The story is more complex than the boredom of small town life and is reasonably satisfying."
5,More Empty Phrase-making from Jack Kemp???,"Not only did our anonymous reviewer forget the 80's economic boom, he apparently forgot to read the book. Hint: Jack Kemp didn't write it..."
3,Good plain fun...3 1/2,"This album is just good plain fun. Simple as that. The beats are very enjoyable, Dan the Automator is magic on this album. And Palumbo is becoming one of my favorite frontman. He sounds amazing in his other band Glassjaw(check them out) and he sounds amazing on this record.The album is not going to change your life, its not revolutionary, but it is good. It is fun, and its a great ride. Pretty much all the tracks are great listens. Standouts include, Beating Heart Baby, King Caeser, and The Razor. Check it out if you want a good dance album. Highly recomended."
4,LETTING GO!!!,"'I JUST WANNA F@CKIN PARTY'!, were the words used by Daryl to describe this album, and how right he is with this an unreal changeup. Its got a superb collection of catchy, dancy songs which will leave you all cracken up laughing! yes, thats rite, a serious changeup to daryls band glassjaw gave us. But all true glassjaw fans will envy at his unique voice letting go in this album more so i think than in any other glassjaw album. well done guys, fans should respect that and if your keen for some laughs and quite a shock, this album is for you! Please, Please Please!!!!!!!"
3,Good but nothing special,"Well I like the cd for the most part. The music is pretty good. The thing I don't like about some of the songs is the vocals. I like his voice alot with Glassjaw but some of the songs here when he sings like in Glassjaw it takes away from the songs. I know people reading this are probably thinking ""Well he does sing in that band also so he should sound like himself"". But what I mean is he has a couple of vocal styles and he uses the wrong one on a few of the songs. Overall its a good cd but nothing great."
4,Not perfect...but good,"Daryl Palumbo...in a dance/poppy rock band?? didn't see that one coming...but him and dan the automator pulled it off. it could've been done better, but this record is still pretty good. Other than the fact that ""Brooklyn is Burning"" is a total ripoff, there are some great songs on here - ""Beating Heart Baby"", ""Please Please Please"", and ""The Razor"" are easily the best, but the whole album is pretty much good. Overall i wouldnt rate this a 5 because it does get old after awhile but is still good to listen to whenever you just wanna have a good time."
4,Pure fun,"Palumbo isn't kidding when he says he just wants to *bleep*ing party. Decadence is the kind of CD you can see people dancing to in the local club. There's a lot of energy throughout the CD. These guys don't take themselves seriously and that's a nice turn because it makes this just a fun, if a bit simple, album. This isn't a great album, but it's still worth every penny. 3.5 stars, giving it 4 because it's closer to a 4 than a 3."
4,Nice step away from bland,"I enjoyed this album. No, its not as good as some of the automaters other works, but still has a catchy sound to it. Basically, this is good cruising music. This is by far not the best cd I own, but I certainly dont think its near to the worst.Its dancy beats are great if your in an upbeat mood and need something to keep you tapping your toes, but this isnt quite the emo kids dream."
3,new to me,"i just got this cd based on a couple reviews and being a glassjaw fan as well as an automator fan (saw him open for the gorillaz show in dc) and the reviewer before me seems to be a little agitated...this cd is for automator fans as well as glassjaw fans. and if that same reviewer thinks palumbo's voice sounds just like every other punk singer not only are they ignorant but they need to seek out ""worship & tribute"" to fully understand.a good album on the whole. tho not a traditional automator album and not a glassjaw album, this album is a ""what if"" album first and foremost. much like the gorillaz this gets your head bobbing and the lyrics and singing give nakamura's heart beat some flesh to bounce behind.in short, i'd recommend it. i just hope if you do get the album, you understand what these guys were trying to accomplish. unfortunately for the aforementioned reviewer, i guess he just doesn't get it."
3,The vicious circle known as Head Automatica,"The paradox is thus:I hate this lead singer. If there is anything that tells me NOT to listen to Glassjaw, it's the vocals from Head Automatica.BUT,The songs here are so friggin' catchy, the lyrics so well written and Automator's beats are so damn phat, that I CAN'T stop listening to it. If only I could somehow replace that guys voice with some one else, then life could be good again.This is a work of the devil...an exercise in self abuse. You have been warned."
2,Yawn.,"This is boring, uninspired modern rock (or as Palumbo calls it, party rock) at it's most mediocre. There is nothing horrible about this record, but there is also nothing good about it either. Sounds like two bored musicians trying to cash in on the new dance-punk (rock) rage going around, while adding a slightly heavier element to it. Save you money for something more challenging, like Rapture's ""Echoes"", Radio4's ""Gotham!"", or a Placebo record."
1,is everyone numb?,i love dan.. hes the man.... but seriously... whatcha doing dantheman?this is poor.. lacks depth... emotion... seems like they met at a party and decided to make some cash ....dan.. lend your skills to more versatile artists... ie. like you did with patton etc.... why add lame sophomore soft rock to your repertoire
2,Definitely NOT for everyone,"A lot of reviewers have it wrong, I am HUGE Glassjaw fan and while I don't hate this, it certainly isn't something I'd listen to. Granted, it's different and yes I 'get it', but it's not something I enjoy. This one is going straight to the used CD store.And while I heard of Gorillaz, I don't know much about the Automator. Again, if this is the kind of music he does, then this is not for me."
5,Genius!,"Anyone could tell that if they would have gotten airplay on ""Please Please Please"" this band would have been a household name and sold a few million records. The best collaboration I have heard in some time, they give the Matrix a run for their money when it comes to songwriting. Hopefully they sold enough for another record at least."
3,Meh.,"Well, I have to say, this is one of the more....interesting albums I've bought recently, and I had higher expectations than it achieved. Once I heard ""Beating Heart Baby"", I immediately went and bought the album, and since then I have only come to like a few songs. One other good one is ""The Speed of a Yellow Bullet"", but pretty much none of the other songs quite catch that same vibe and run with it, and the album suffers for it, unfortunately. I'm sure that some will find this album to be very listenable, but I would advise most to just download the two songs mentioned above and save your money."
5,It's about time,"My first thought when I heard that Daryl Palumbo and Dan the Automator had cut an album together was that it was going to be another of those hastily thrown-together novelty collaborations that offer little in the way of substance. But really, this is what pop rock should be. It's made to be fun, and you can tell that it was designed with basement parties and driving with the windows down in mind.But, and this is key, It's not dumbed down. The lyrics aren't exactly thought-provoking, but they're far from the pabulum that you can expect from pop rock these days. The production is forceful and driving, but also as thoughtful and complicated as anything else that Dan the Automator has applied himself to.My only complaint about the album is that it's just under 38 minutes long, and that's just not enough."
5,Could Headautomatica be the newest lovemaking CD??,"I got the chance to see this live and I was blown away. Daryl Palumbo (GlassJAw) has showed us that sometimes you just need to dance. That's exactly what this CD does, is dance. Daryl gives us a taste of what he is about. We've all heard him scream and sing a bit on GJ records, but have you heard him put an effort into it? Unless you have listened to H.A. the answer is straight up a no. I love metal, I love screaming, and I love breakdowns and solo's, but this cd has none of that, and I still love it. Headautomatica have a poppy, dancing, techno, garage band mixed with new wave sound.. That's the best I can describe it. If you like Elvis Costello, Beck or even the Commadores, check out Headautomatica. If they did a cover of ""Brick House"" it would be awesome.. Definately a must if you are willing to take a risk and listen to something new. It also serves as a great lovemaking cd"
4,Good stuff,"Since the old, 2CD DG recording of this piece is not available, this is the only choice. ""Drumming"" is a very fine work by Reich, more rigorous and less immediately lovely than ""Music for 18 Musicians,"" but rewarding nonetheless. It's an important transition piece between his early work and ""18."" The first section is literally all drumming, and builds through an arch structure using Reich's technique of rhytmic patterns moving in and out of phase. The following sections add tuned percusion, e.g. marimbas, and move towards his newer style of more harmonic richness, with chords gradually building, shifting, conflicting and moving to new tonal centers. Obviously, if Reich's style of Minimalism doesn't appeal, you won't like this CD. But if you enjoy his other work, this will be a great addition to your collection."
3,Disappointed...,"My first exposure to Steve Reich was the perfection of his ""18 Musicians."" I've since tried five or six of his other titles, but I rarely if ever play them.This one in particular has been gathering dust almost since I brought it home. Perhaps I ""just don't get it,"" but it seems just plainly repetitous, with no real evolution taking place."
2,Thick Book of Common Sense,"I bought this book when I was a project manager wishing to improve my project management skill. Very disappointed to discovered that the whole book was consists of just COMMON SENSE, no insight at all."
5,I did it right because of this book.,"I thought the last project was going to be a disaster, but this fun-loving book saved my rear. Thanks Bakers!"
5,perfect beginner guide,"Whether you are just learning about project management or are behind in one, this book is full of helpful hints to get you on track and keep you there. I found the book to be a handy resource for every step and process in Project management."
5,"A must-have for beginners, a good reference for veterans","Sunny and Kim Baker have translated the Project Management Institute's standards into plain English. I have frequently recommended it to my clients and colleagues, as an excellent ""Project Management 101"" introductory course. For beginners, I can say ""go read the book, then let's talk"". As for veterans, too many so-called project managers do not truly understand project management. This book shows the big picture, and teaches how to avoid the pitfalls into which we so often fall. Thanks, Sunny and Kim!"
1,Don't Buy the Kindle Edition,"The book is decent enough, but the Kindle edition is plagued with an unacceptable number of typos and errors. What should be two ""r""s is written as an ""m"" and so forth. If it were a constant thing, I could just get used to it, but the errors aren't even consistent. Words like ""closed"" appear as either ""close]"" or ""closeg."" I just came across a sentence that read, ""Is he wishing he could the too?"" It's like reading a book translated by babelfish."
5,"Wishing That Simon Was Real..Oh Yeah, The Book Was Good Too!","I loved it! I had read the sequel to this book, ""Blood and Chocolate,"" before I knew this book existed. When my friend told me there was a book before it I was intrigued, but didn't show too much inituitive. That is, until I saw it at the book store. I bought it and found it better than the sequel. Klause's use of drama and the fear of the unknown twisted from a horror story to a tear-jerking romance. Also, her description of the boy-vampire, Simon, was very vivid and made me instantly fall in love with this supposedly hansome, dark, mysterious and whimsical character. I would suggest it for older readers or kids who aren't sheltered from swearing and so forth, since this is in a high school ('nuff said)."
4,It was a wonderful book for vampire and romance lovers,"This book was a wonderful mix of horror, with a touch of unrequited love. I could hardly put it down. It was a well written and enjoyable."
4,Not at all what I expected,"So going into this book I figured itd be your classic romance story of to people who cant be together, pretty much Romeo and Juilet. But I was surprised to find that the story didnt dive right into that. There was a much bigger story than just two teenagers hooking up. The ending very much surprised me as well. I just didnt see it coming as soon as it did.This is basically a story about two teenagers finding themselves all alone in the world. One trapped by the undead and the other trapped by the uncoming death of her mother. They take on comfort in their short friendship to understand each others fears about death. Its a beautifully written story full of suspense and meaning. Highly recommended."
2,Short Say,Although this book was interesting in some of the twists it was overall predictable. Very solid for the 13 and under age group though if your looking for the quality of Blood and Chocolate it isn't in this book.
4,a magical tale for all ages,"I remember that The Silver Kiss was the first vampire novel I ever read. I was so captivated I became an avid vampire fan. I was so happy that someone had finally written a book geared toward young adults that was not shallow, and was an intelligent as well as entertaining read. It goes beyond being a simple vampire tell, it explores the themes of love, change, and even death of a loved one. Even years after I read it(or any young adult book, for that matter) it stays in my mind and my heart. I could pick it up now and enjoy almost as much as I did when I was a young girl reading it for the first time."
4,Ok book,This book was not the best book I ever read it was boring most of the time in till the end when it got more interesting and exciting so it was good but not the best.
1,if there were some -5 stars rating that would be the rateing,After reading the great book called Blood and chocolate by curtis i thought this would be a good book i was sorely dissapointed. the vampire plot with the two brothers has been overused and was done much better in the vampire diaryies by l j smith this book had no plot climax no hook to catch your attention i mean after see the guy twice she is in his arms talk about easy it sounds like curtis is too lazy to write a whole book like maybe she just wanted to get it over with this book is trash i would buy it if they were giving it away.
2,The silver kiss,In my opionion The silver kiss was a good story. Its just i really didnt like how fast it went or how it ended.... . But dont get me wrong it was a real page turner i couldnt wait to finish.
2,lacking substance,i found the book to be dreadful. It was too watered down and it didnt flow very well. IT is a light easy read but you'll find your slef terribly disappointed at the end.
1,DaJuan ...,"Someone told me about this book that's whatmade me pick it. This bookwill fallin the category of horro/alove story. This story is mostly about two people who fall in love. Their namesare Zoe and Simon. Simonis a vampire and can't come out in the morning. He has blonde hair , and isn't very shy. ZoeThough, is very shallow, and is a normal person. She is a brunette with eyes like an early summerbreeze. They were important because they were the main characters in the story, and they were what the story was based on."
5,Let me be part of the story!,"I had just finished this book like 10 minutes ago and I amstill numb... I really love this book. It not only deals withVampire and love(which i like), it also dealt with lonliness and people's emotional strength.If there was no school, i would had finished it in one day, but i had to go so it took me 2 days. This goes to show how i can't put it down. The story doesn't drag and drag like some books.I wanted to be part of it so badly...I wanted to be sucked into the book and be Zoe (i didn't say i want my mom to have cancer). To have met someone like Simon would have been wonderful. ::sign:: I can totally relate. A very touching story...to me anyway.*~~^{Faith}^~~* (<>..~*)"
2,Dont pay attention to the other reviews,"This book was pretty aweful. I suppose if you listened to the other reviews you would assume its pretty good. Let me tell you it's not. Most of the reviews written are probably coming from teenage girls. If you like vampires and you think this book can cure your hunger, I urge you to look somewhere else. Perhaps I might reccomend Anne Rice's vampire novels, Stephen King's ""Salem's Lot"", and Bram Stoker's original vampire novel ""Dracula"". All of those books do what this book does but a thousand times better. The author has absolutely no writing skills and struggles to keep the plot moving. There are whole sections of the book which drag on for ages with nothing happening. You could easily skim the pages and pick up 99% of the story. There isn't much substance. If you're looking for a romantic vampire love story, I urge you to look elsewhere. This book is a trainwreck."
4,Good First Novel,This book is a good read for the pre-teen/teen crowd. It keeps you interested through most of the story. The characters are well defined. You care what happens to them. The Silver Kiss is a nice addition to vampire and young adult literature.
3,Memborable,"I read this book back when I was 15. Found it on amazon and decided to read it again. It wasn't as amazing as I remembered it the first time probably because I was a teenager and now I'm an adult and have read a lot more books since then, but I did enjoy the book. I didn't enjoy the ending but it was a godo ending for the book. I just couldn't get myself to like Simon he seemed weak and fragile for a vampire I just didn't enjoy his character. The teenage girl was very easy to relate with and completely realistic. It was a good book to relax and read for 2hrs in the day. It read smoothly and even though it was my second time reading it, it seemed like a different book."
3,It was O.K.A.Y,"I wont lie and say this book had an effect on me, because frankly it didn't in the least.Sure it wasn't bad, I wouldnt classify it as bad, but it wasn't good either. If you're going to read one of these authors books, read Blood and Chocoalte. But dont see the movie. My god, dont see the movie. It was awful!But im off subject.The Silver Kiss had a weak and depressing ending that make you want to say ""GSDJBSDBSYGFAJDGAH"" really quickly over and over.To end this, I just want to say, read the book,but dont buy it.=)"
2,the silver kiss,This book is about a teenage girl. Her mother is dying and her best friend is moving. In all of this she falls in love with a boy named simon. But simonis not what he seems to be.....he is a vampire and is looking for revenge for the death of his mother. I thought that this book was ok for a young reader but if you are looking for more of a deeper book then it is not for you.I think that the writter tried to act too young and exaggerated too much.
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!,"I loved this book sooooo much. My teacher reccomended it to me and told me it was one of her faves, so I took it home and I couldn't put it down! I fell fast in love with the book. Normally, I don't read, but this book is incredible! I felt like I was there. The story really moved me. The endidng made me cry, I don't know why though!! READ IT!! YOU'LL LOVE IT!!!"
4,Great escape book,"This book was a classic vampire story. It is a good short read easy to keep up with but definitley has that effect to pull a reader in, thought it was short and easy it had strong emotions and it was very compelling. The vampires seemed realistic and their point of views were great, the realationships between the characters were also great. I must say the ending didn't suit me as a person but it was still a good end perfect for this book.So if you want a easy read that still has romance a bit of drama and action pick this up and immerse yourself into the world of death (dont worry nothing truly terrible) and vampires."
4,an easy light read,"I'm not going to say what this book is about. There are plenty of those already. I agree with most of the other reviews about this book. I picked it up not knowing anything about this author or her writing style. Even though it is a bit young for me I thought that I just might enjoy it. I must say that I did. It has some witty humor, a small love story, and a little bit of violence. Everything I look for in a book. The only thing I really didn't like was the way it ended. It makes Simon look selfish in his decision. I won't say what he did. You have to read the book to find out. If you want something easy and light to read pick this up."
1,"cliched, cliched, cliched","What more can I say? As a writer & reader of young adult novels, this book was quite a disappointment. Everything was cliched. All the images, the struggles, etc. Bypass this book and pick up some Christopher Pike or Lisa Jane Smith books if you want some real good vampire reading."
1,The Silver Kiss,The book was right but I ordered this for my Grand-Daughter. She wanted the OLD cover and that was the pic that I ordered. So she is not Happy!
2,Confused,I saw that the rating on this book was pretty good so I decided to read it. I was extremely disappointed! I could never really get into the story and I thought Simon was just weird. I would not recommend this book.
3,Fell flat,"I have read all the Twilight Series, loved them. Wanted to read something like that so I read the reviews sounded good. Over all the book was okay, I have to admit that it was hard to want to put the book down, because you felt for the characters but didnt have the romance I wanted. I didnt really like the ending either, it fell flat.Borrow this from the library, fast read."
2,Disappointed,"When i started reading this book i had very high expectations for it, it was a book about vampires and i was hoping it would be as mesmerizing as the Twilight series. This is short book only 198 pages and failed to capture my interest, it had its good moments but i never hesitated to put it down and go to bed. The chapter set up (every other chapter was in the perspective of a different character [Zoe or Simon]) was interesting and was one of the things i liked but the things that i did enjoy were few. If you are trying to decide if you should read this book or not i would try for another book, but if you do choose this book prepare for a short story that isn't very powerful."
4,This Book Made Me cry,"You know its kind of sad that I can remember the guys name, which is Simon, but I can't remember the girls name that the story is supposed to be about. But then I'm bad with names too. Anyways This story is about a young lady who is going through some hard times because her mom is sick and meets a young atractive vampire who is fasinated by her. But there is a twist. The twist is the reason the book made me cry. When I finished the book I felt like throwing it against the wall. It does bring out every emotion that you can think of off the top of your head. Joy, sadness, grief, relief, nervousness. This is an excellent book and you should definately read it. Its filled with a lovely bit of romance not to sound superficial but, for we girls the guy sounds hot. Oh by the way I lent the book to a couple of friends and the keep telling me how great the book is and that they don't want to give it back. So, read the book yourself and tell me what you think... please."
5,"Beautiful book. I laughed, I cried...","Meet Zoe, 16 years old, mother dying of cancer, her only friend moving, and a father who is too preoccupied to recognize his daughter's existence on the earth.Meet Simon, 200 year old vampire, and a sole purpose in afterlife to destroy his evil vampire brother who murdered their mother.What could these two possibly have in common?They're both alone. And they're two worlds are about to collide.Zoe feels like no one remembers her or understands how she feels. Until she meets Simon, frightening and mysterious. And as Zoe later find out, he's a vampire. He understands her lonliness and fear of loss. Because he had been alone for centuries and his mother was killed by his own brother, Christopher, also a vampire, and the cause of a mysterious chain of murders spreading through the town. Simon has to stop him. And Zoe's along for the ride.This is the first vamp book I read and really got me into the genre. ..."
3,OK/I don't recommend It,"The book ""The Silver Kiss"" was not a very good book. The thing that bugged me the most was the way they drug things out. It was very boring at first, but after you get into the book it gets a little suspensful. The part I like is where Zoe sees Simon eating a bird in the alley. If you are into vampires and mystery then this might be the book for you."
3,Great book,"I ejoyed reading The Silver Kiss. I find it was short, but overall it was a good read. I read it in one day, that's how short it was though.I enjoyed her other book, Blook and chocolate as well."
2,eh...,"I read Blood and Chocolate, loved the romance[albeit it slutty] and I thought this might compare. I read this book in one sitting, because I love romance and I kept waiting for it to pick up. It finally did towards the end, after a tumultuous load of teenage angst. And then the ending was just... ugh. That's about all I can say. It's an ok book, if you're desperate for a vampy read."
3,A pretty good book,"""The Silver Kiss"" is a good book, but not the best thing that I ever read. The book was really good in some parts but really boring in the other parts. I would say that this book is a Romantic Thriller, Simon (a vampire) falls in love with a girl named Zoe. Even though Simon has all these feelings for Zoe, his urge for blood is just to strong. Simon, I think, is the best character in this book. I guess I just like reading about vampires and things of that nature. This is a good book if you like to read things about vampires or you like the read Romantic Thrillers."
4,The Silver Kiss,Zoes mom has cancer and is going to die. She meets a guy named simon who is a vampire. Simon's trying to kill his brother chris because chris killed there mom. On top of zoes mom dying she just found out that the best friend is moving to Oregon. Simon knows a lot about death and helps zoe with her mom. In return zoe helps simon kill chris by throwing a crocifix around chris's neck. Simon kills himself willingly but instead of a painful death he fades into the air. Zoe and her dad get closer but admitting zoes mom death.
4,Worth Reading If You Like Buffy and Spike!,"Oh man I read this book way back when I was in 7th grade... It was one of the first vampire books I had read at that time, and one that I read on my own that wasn't forced upon by teachers. Even as a 12 year old, I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!! I would say for an adult it is a fairly quick read. The story is great! There's history, action, family, drama, love; The author just kept it a little PG when it comes to the love and romance part, I think, which kind of stinks for those of us that like a little more raunchiness ;-D PLEase read it!!"
3,well..,"Like many readers, I loved Blood and Chocolate (the novel NOT the movie) and went right to The Silver Kiss. I give it three stars because I thought the story was moving. Young girl, mother dying of cancer, and her father just trying to cope and be there for his beloved wife. I found myself near tears at certain moments it was so poignant. I only give it three because I thought this was going to be ""vampire"" book the way Blood and Chocolate was a ""werewolf"" book. Simon, the vampire, was not the main character, the way Vivian Gandillon was in B&C. And his character and background story were not as interesting as Zoe's. I think Annette Curtis Klause could have removed Simon altogether, changed the title and gave more Zoe and it would have made for a much better novel."
5,One of the best books!,"This book is great! The author, Annette Curtis Klause, really brings forbidden love to life!The story is about this girl called Zoe and a vampire called Simon. Zoe's mom is dying and she feels she is ignored by both her father and her mother. Her best friend is moving away from her. So, basically her life sucks. But she finds comfort in the arms of Simon.Simon had a horrible past and hopes that Zoe would help him get rid of it. Would she help him?find out the answer in this beautifully written, gripping, exciting book! :)"
4,"This was a great story, so...","Hey! READ THIS BOOK!!! It is soooo amazingly wonderful. I mean, it has everything-horror, love, pain, seduction. It is one of the best books I have ever read. It kept me hooked from beginning to end-no lie! Even if you dont believe in the undead ( i do ) I can gaurantee you will fall in love with the caharacters, the story, and the author...( you might want to read the sequel)"
5,Couldn't put it down.,"I saw this book at my school library and decided it look great. So I checked it out an read it in two nights. It was wonderful! Zoe is a normal girl, described so well you feel as though she's one of your best friends, and Simon is described as perfectly as any vampire could be. He seems a little sexy at that, too. Zoe's facing hardships just like Simon, and eventually they learn to love each other and themselves. I think it's a perfect mix of romance and horror."
3,Disappointing,"Annette Curtis Klause is one of my fave authors, but this book is definitely not one of her good books.Zoe is the daughter of a woman dying of cancer. Zoe feels as if she's isolated, etc. She meets a boy in the park, Simon and becomes good friends with him. Simon turns out to be a vampire. Simon's brother, Christopher, is supposedly evil and Simon's life purpose is to kill him. Zoe decides to help.The end is disappointing and it seems so... stupid!! I love books or basicly anything about vampires and it's all very interesting to me, but this book is not a good one.Boring. Over-dramatic. Stupid.~(...)"
3,Not too shabby,"Granted that the book's over 10 years old, it wasn't all that bad. I have to admit, I've read better Vampire stories. But, while admitting that, I also have to confess that it kept my attention through the whole book.There were parts where it seemed like Klause was pulling vampire characteristics out of thin air. Literally. I would have liked for it to end differently. Maybe with Zoe and Simon becoming closer or for Simon to turn Zoe. Unfortunately, that's not quite what happened. At least they found peace. Each in their own ways.The books really deserves 3 and a half stars."
4,Different,This is not what typically young adults are used to reading. It is different yet mesmerizing. Each chapter leaves you eager to know what happens next. It deals with real life issues and problems. Zoe's terminally ill mother and Simon's coping with loss are all significant aspects of life today. Great book you will enjoy it!
4,Good traditional men's scent,"I have been wearing Drakkar for over 10 years and it has a consistent, non-overpowering scent. The compliments I recieve from others whenver I wear it are more than with any other cologne. Good deal, quick shipping. A-"
5,80's Flashback?,"Sure, it may be. But I always get complements from the ladies when wearing this.Now my twenty-something son even uses it."
1,99% Certain This is Fake!,"I've been wearing Drakkar for over 20 yrs. I know what it smells like and how long the scent lasts. This product is like rubbing alcohol in a bottle. Also, the bottle had fingerprints on it and an area that looked like a price sticker had been on it. I am confident saying like some other reviewers that the product I received was a fake. I'll be returning this one. I should've know the price was too good to be true..."
3,Not good as this really is.,"I feel like a got a fake one, the one that I got before , the smell it was pretty good. Not is more alcohol ."
3,Mind the addiction,I was disappointed. Probably because I was expecting it to be like the Ski Movie 2. Kind of boring compared to it.
5,You must own this blanket.,This is the softest blanket ever! The blanket is well made and very good quality.
2,A real travesty. Sorry,"OK - I'm a huge Pratchett fan, but this book went wrong horribly. It takes the form of two stories which have absolutely nothing to do with each other and finishes with an appaling ending which has no relation to the rest of the book. However, plot aside, this is extremely funny reading as ever - it's just that the story itself isn't up to scratch."
2,somewhat of a disappointment,"Compared to most of his other books, this one is disappointing. Maybe funny to self-depreciating Aussies, to the rest of the world's citizens this book offers little to laugh out loud about. Unless of course the sight and sound of someone wearing a hat with corcks attached saying ""g'day, mate"" has you rolling in the aisles. Better luck next time; we know he CAN do it!"
2,not for me,"There are numerous books in the discworld series that I have enjoyed and some that I loved reading (eg. Hogfather and Guard,Guards). The Lost Continent is not of them. In fact, I have not liked any of the Rincewind novels that I have read. I found this one rather excruciating actually. It was cliched and it was dull. I am surprised by the positive reviews it has received here. Different strokes for different folks I guess. In future I will stick to the guards and the witches."
2,Flogging the dead horse,"I love Terry Pratchett. The Colour of Magic holds a prize place on my shelf, with Good Omens and Equal Rites not far behind, but The Last Continent? It's in a box in the garage. In The Last Continent we once again meet the inept wizzard Rincewind and his many-legged Luggage. In this adventure they end up in a place that is the Discworld equivalent of Australia. And just to make sure you know what continent he means, Pratchett rams our (the reader's) faces in cliche` after cliche`. Some of the abused Australian cliche`s are amusing, even to me, an Australian, but enough is enough. Terry Pratchett is a good writer and it shows in the fact that I was able to finish this book. Had it been a less readable author, I would have stopped half-way through. Definately not Pratchett's finest hour and I hope he stops churning novels out in such a manner. He can only rely on his name for so long. And a name and a few good one liners are not enough to make a novel."
2,"With Any Luck, the Last Rincewind Book","This was the first Pratchett book I read, and my original review is on Amazon; I still stand by it, but have revised my rating downward after reading the rest of the Discworld novels. It is funny in parts and full of pop-culture references, but does not hold together as a story. There isn't much plot, or, rather, there is far too much to pay attention to. Rincewind is not a character in this book so much as an excuse to roam around Australia; the wizards of Unseen University show up, but if you don't already know them, or even if you do, you'll find their characters quite poorly differentiated. _Interesting Times_ and _The Light Fantastic_ are better Rincewind novels, but I would recommend spending your valuable free time reading the the City Watch or Witches Discworld novels instead."
2,a waste of time,"Funny in an infantile kind of a way, this book. In other words, Pointless and Silly."
3,"Well-done in the small, but not much of a plot","Pratchett likes to skewer stereotypes, images, culture, and more, and in this case he sets his sites on Australian stereotypes and culture - plus ventures into dieties, evolution, and the sex life (or lack therof of wizards).Character-wise and humor wise, this is as good as any of his other books. Rincewind is up to his old tricks (mainly running away), we get much more into the mind of the Unseen University's leaders, and even a bit more of Mrs. Whitlow. The jokes are funny, the plays on words the usual classic pratchett, and the writing solid.However, the plot really just isn't that interesting, for what there is of it. There's some beautifully mystical and emotional moments, but it just doesn't hang together to produce much plot.Unlike most Discworld books, which I'll reread, I doubt I'll reread this one. Sure it was worth getting as a Pratchett fan, yes its head-and-sholders above many other works. However it's just not great."
4,Top notch in all but parallel plots,"I give this book four stars for being hilarious, but I was disappointed with the clumsy ending. Usually Terry Pratchett ties the plot strands of each novel up neatly in his Discworld novels, but in The Last Continent it is almost as if he got someone else to write the last fifty pages. The two different storylines (Rincewind's adventures and the wizards on the island) could be from any other Discworld book, and don't fit together neatly at the end at all. It's a pity the imagination shown throughout the book doesn't quite last up to the climax."
3,Excellent if you understand the 'Australianisms',"This is one of those novels that is absolutely brilliant if you fully understand the culture and myths of Australia. Many of the earlier reviewers who have panned the novel for having a lack of plot obviously fail to understand the stories that make up the Australian concious. The construction of a nation based on its myths is well and truly a stroke of genious on Prachetts behalf, yet unless you do not hail from these parts then much of the plot may seem irrelevent to the reader. An excellent read with maybe too many in jokes for the rest of the world."
4,Really quite good,"Enjoyable, of course, but slightly sloppier at times than some of his other books. The two plots only come together at the very end (which is annoying), and in a very discreet manner, so as to prevent you from noticing. Still, I laughed harder at bits of this book than I have at any other Pratchett book, so it couldn't have been that bad"
3,Discworld - The ending of a series,"I once read that Pratchett was going to stop the Discworld series at 25 books, and I think it's starting to show in his writing. I read ""The Last Continent"" because it was about Rincewind, and Rincewind is always funny. It wasn't, at least not as funny as other Discworld books, and it seemed like the effort really wasn't there. It was more like reading an Australian version of ""Silverlock"" (where the main character meets and interacts with famous literary characters), than a Discworld book about Rincewind getting out of trouble he caused to himself.This is one Discworld book that I most likely will not read until it falls apart. It's still a good story, but not quite up to the level set by the other books in the series."
5,Hmmm...,"Can't say this is the greatest Pratchett book I've ever read. These days it seems as though Discworld novels are sort of hit-or-miss. I loved Soul Music, Interesting Times, and Hogfather; I was less than impressed with Maskerade, Feet of Clay, Jingo, and this. I was glad to see that the Unseen U faculty featured prominently here, but they just don't seem as dynamic as they have in the past. I dunno; this just didn't really strike me. Maybe Carpe Jugulum will be better..."
2,"OK, but slipping","Pratchett's diskworld series is vastly entertaining, but the latest offering is running out of imagination. The plot is bizzare (OK all Pratchett plots are bizzare, but this one is close to random) The main character, Rincewind, doesn't really develop, just more of the same that we've seen before. It seems more like a series of somewhat related short stories (the part about the wizards on the island of the god that doesn't know about sex doesn't seem to have any relevance to the main plot at all)Equal Rites was one of the funniest books I ever read, The Last Continent is set in the same mileau, but just isn't up to Pratchett's earlier standard."
2,sub-par storytelling for once,"It is hard to believe that this book comes from the same author whose work has always been characterized by superbly constructed storylines and very witty dialogue. This story, unfortunately, has neither. There are two loosely connected storylines, one centered around Rincewind and containing all the wit and wisdom of a draft script for Crocodile Dundee part IV; the other one starring the wizards of Unseen University that will leave the reader as confused about the point of it all as it does the principal characters.Mr. Pratchett is to be commended for wanting to put out a new Discworld novel each year. But if the spirit for once doesn't move him, we'll gladly wait a little longer."
4,Not his best,"I am a truely obsessive Pratchett fan and could hardly fail to enjoy anything he has written. However if I had to choose I would put this as one of my least favourive of his books. Possibly my lack of knowlege of Australian culture has made me miss out on some of the subtler satire. I found that the main plot with Rincewind dragged a little in places. There were some funny jokes but I felt that his quest, the actual plot I suppose, failed to interest me in the least and served more as a background for the gags. Some of his other books have managed to mix humour with a truely gripping story.This book would probably have been rated lower if it wasn't for the antics of the wizards. It's not Pratchett's most mature or inteligent humour but it had me in stitches. It is almost worth reading this book just for their bickering. Oh and the origins of the duck-billed platypus are pure genius.All together it is an enjoyable read in places but he has written better."
3,2 better than 1,It is great to see Rincewind back in action. His part of the story is realy fun. But the part about the UU wizzard is not very good.I will give it a 4 starts for Rincewind part alone
4,No Worries,"It probably is strange to see how some people only give the book 2 stars and find it a big disappointment, while others say it is his best one yet... Terry writes far more than 1 book-a-year which sometimes shows in his work. If you are a die-hard Discworld fan, you can't help noticing that Pratchett is getting less original all the time. But he has to repeat things, because non-Discworld fans have to be able to read the books as well. It is pretty weird to assume everone knows about a world standing on the back of a turtle; these things need to be explained over and over again. BUT in this book Mr. Pratchett doesn't write about most of his 'clichees', but about an entire new continent (XXXX for the fans) and still people (Discworld-fans!!) complain. A bit australianish as the cover says, but still very nice to read.Still no worries eh?"
4,"Despite disparate plot lines, his usual funny and ironic sto","Despite the disparate story lines, I didn't mind finding Rincewind once more (he seems to be improving slowly, but the bit of the Librarian changing form with (to me) no particular reason was a bit far gone. I liked the Aussie slang (was intimidated by same in WW II), which seems to have improved to a good extent by now. Pratchett messing about with gods does not strike me as all that funny, so I simply pass it over as his ironic treatment of organized religion(?) No worse than Jingo, far better than Eric, not as ""dark"" as Carpe Jugulum. He and Neil Gaiman used Australia in Good Omens, too."
3,Somewhat of a disappointment,"Being a die-hard Pratchett fan, I anxiously await each of his new releases. Unfortunately, this one was not up to par. Although it does have some laughs, it is not nearly as tongue-in-cheek humorous as we have come know and love of the Discworld novels. I wouldn't go so far as to not recommend this book, just don't expect Pratchett's usual brilliant effort!"
2,not up to Pratchett's usual level,"As a diehard Pratchett-fan, I was sorely disappointed in his latest effort. A few things you can always be certain of in a Pratchett novel: very funny dialogue and a cleverly constructed storyline. Alas, both are missing in this Discworld-instalment: two very loosely intertwined storylines that are basically going nowhere. The one with the wizards will only make you laugh out loud if you're a member of a live studio audience, and the one about Australia has the feel of a script for Crocodile Dundee part IV. We must commend Terry Pratchett for insisting to have a new book out each year; but hey, if the spirit doesn't move him we will gladly wait a little longer until it does. Then we can again expect great books like Jingo, the rest of the Guards- and Weatherwax-series or deep and very funny stuff like Small Gods."
1,Maybe the worst of Discworld,"I honestly couldn't believe how bad this book was. Rincewind ismy 2nd favorite Discworld character (Death), but this was nothim.It started out good, with the usual Pratchett ""I wish I woulda thoughta that"" imagination. But I don't know, it seemed to me that after the first 50 pages or so ...he was the only one who thought this stuff was funny. I love the DW books with the wizards, too, but these were not them either. There are a few parts where Pratchett just goes on and on and on and on about something that stopped being funny 5 pages ago.Worst of all, the plot is erratic. There are way too many things going on which aren't ever explained. That's not like Pratchett either.A few good jokes (one particular I was in pain laughing so hard), but that's it. Sorry Terry, you missed badly with this one. END"
2,Not really standalone,"The most unfortunate thing about this book is that you should have read Pratchett's other novels to catch some jokes about Rincewind, the wizards and other characters. My intention was to introduce a friend to Terry Pratchett's hilarious writing and was not able to use this book for that reason. I would probably have to use some other book, may be ""Moving Pictures"".Apart from that, this book is only moderately funny and Pratchett resorts to some cheap puns here and there, which I found disappointing. This is a novel that seems like Pratchett wrote at the insistence of the publishers, but did not really have the energy to."
2,I Just Didn't Get It,"I have read and re-read this book, but I just didn't get a whole lot of enjoyment out of it. Perhaps it is because I am an American and not familiar with Australia? That has to be it, because other than that, I have deeply enjoyed all of the other Pratchett novels and look forward to each publication with bated breath."
2,Good for Australians only,"I just finished reading all of the Rinsewind novels and this was the only one that I didn't like. It was full of obscure Australian jokes that only an Australian would understand. The plot was often warped in order to make one of these jokes, so if you don't ""get"" the joke, all you have is a warped plot. I found an ""annotation"" file on the internet that explained these jokes, but jokes are much less funny if you have to have them explained (the annotation file is on the l-space web - do a search on ""l-space web"").This book can be safely skipped without missing any of the bigger picture that carries across novels.I've rated this 2 stars, rather than 1, since it IS a Terry Pratchett novel after all, and even poor Terry Pratchett novels are better than the average."
4,"PRATCHETT SUCCOMES TO ""Australian Syndrome.""","Terry Pratchett's works are highly original and entertaining, (his latin tie-ins are reminisint of James Joyce.) YET like most British people he has used the ""XXXX"", Vegemite and ""Bloke"" line. Australia is the subject of yet another ""Colonial Joke."" STILL it is most entertaining and should be read by anyone who likes light-hearted adventure novels. If you've read anything by Pratchett then read this, but save a thought for us Australians. Most of my friends read this book so I must be just a reactionary."
4,Better than most Rincewind tales,"I'm primarily a fan of the Watch (Guards! Guards! and Men at Arms) and I typically grow very tired of Rincewind. This volume was a hoot, though. The wizards of Unseen University are very well served by placing them outside their usual environment. The usual appearances by Death are satisfactory as well. Not quite as good as his previous work, but Pratchett is holding up very well besides."
3,"Good, but new-comers should read the old titles first.","Though a late-comer, I have become a die-hard fan of Pratchett's 'Discworld' and can understand the mixed reviews his book has received. Rincewind and his Luggage are enjoyable characters, constantly tossed through time and space without respite. I fear, though, that like another character, Vimes, Rincewind may be at the endpoint of his adventures. The end leaves the impression that Rincewind could return with the UU faculty back to Ankh-Morpork, no longer a 'game-piece' for Lady Luck."
3,A less-solid Discworld book,"[For context's sake, I have been reading the Discworld books in publication order. The Last Continent is #22.]The Last Continent was good...but not as engaging as many Discworld books. The commentary on existing countries and cultures was fun, but not quite enough to make up for some weird plot and character devices, and some fairly contrived situations. Of course there were moments of brilliance and hilarity. It just wasn't as all-around solid as I would have liked."
4,The Last Continent,"The last continent is Terry Pratchett's 22nd discworld novel and a standout for me.The novel features the wizards of Unseen University needing to find a cure for the Librarian's magical flu and somehow winding up being trapped with the God of Evolution. Whilst the Wizards are trapped in paradise (with all the bickering you'd expect), Rinsewind is on XXXX. Rinsewind once again just wants to be left alone and somehow instead ends up having to be the reluctant hero yet again.The diaogue and jokes are fast paced and the book has Pratchett's usual flair.As an Australian XXXX pokes fun at Australian culture and more than one read is needed to get all the jokes (I'm still finding something new to write about and it's been my favourite book for years).A good read for anyone wanting a laugh."
2,What's missing?,"I was very disappointed with this book. For someone quite experienced with Java it might serve as a good tool for jogging the memory. When you are in the process of discovery it is a very difficult book to use. The index and the table of contents center around classes, not topics. If you don't already know the classes count on wading endlessly back and forth through this book. For the programming I was doing the reference was very incomplete, even regarding the basics. I found references on the Internet to be much more helpful than this book."
2,just aight,"Donell Jones peaked with his ""Where I wanna Be "" Album&that seems a long,long,long time ago now. back then when his cut ""U know what's up"" was getting much play Usher his then LaFace Labelmate was in his video like a extra. talk about time changing things? fast forward to now&Donell has this album out which for the most part sounds like a artist just going through the motions to get out of a Contract. not One song stands out here. he is being forced to work with outside writers&Producers&it ain't really him&you can tell. vocally He still is good,but the material leaves alot to be desired on a whole."
2,"Nice, BUT NOT LIKE THE OTHERS!!!","I was so anxious to get this CD, everyday I kept checking to see if it was available yet....Finally purchased it and after listening to the entire CD, I was a little disappointed. Being a big Donell Jones fan I have given some time for some of the songs to grow on me, but that is the problem with this CD---it had to grow on me where all 3 of his previous CD's I took a liking to from the first time hearing it. Usually I take to Donell Jones slow songs in an instant, but with this CD my favorite songs would have to be track 2 and track 5 and those are probably the most up-tempo beats on there....He did an alright job with this CD and anybody who is a Donell Jones fan like me would purchase it to add to the collection. However, this CD does not even come close to his others. So I am not going to say whether to buy it or not."
2,ain't really feeling this joint,"I'm surprised that this CD has gotten so many great reviews. Upon listening to it, it fell flat. I just wasn't feeling none of the songs. It seemed that there was a lot of filler tracks on this album. And the lyrics to the songs weren't that great either. The only song I liked was ""I'm Gonna Be"". That song reminds you of something Usher might do and the lyrics and the beat to it were real nice.Maybe it's just me but I really didn't think this CD was great. I like Donnell Jones but this CD by him was a little dissapointing. The album titled ""Life Goes On"" is the one to own by DJ. That is one of his best and that CD was good from beginning to end (some real good R&B;). Even though other people like this CD, I really don't recommend it. Instead get ""Life Goes On"" by Donnell if you don't have it."
1,Donnell Jones new album/Rhymefest's new album,"I have been waiting on 2 cd's for almost two months. I am yet to receive ""Journey of a Gemini"", or ""Blue Collar Music"". If possible, can I be reimbursed, or sent another copy of each cd. Please let me know. Thank you."
5,Long Awaited Return By Donell Jones,"I'm in total agreement with most of the 5 star reviews here, but fans are also urged toinvest in the Circuit City Edition of Donell's new CD, which includes 2 HOT BONUS TRACKS....16. Baby, It's You (featuring Rico Love)17. Apple Pie (Featuring Clipse)*Also, try to locate the mid 2005 Promo CD by Donell Jones. This was an earlier version of his 'Journey Of A Gemini' CD, but it includes the following tracks, which were left off of the 2006 Edition...1. Lovin' U2. Marry Me3. September Love4. U Make Me Feel5. Azzville6. Treat U Right7. Shut U Down8. You Didn't Love MeWelcome back Donell, and thanks for the great CD!! Sorry your record companyrefuses to promote you properly...You deserve MUCH BETTER!!Peace, SD(of 'Chaka's World')"
5,THIS BLACK MAN IS BAD- LINDA C. FROM VIRGINIA,"I REALLY DIDN'T CARE FOR HIS FIRST CD BUT THIS NEW ONE IS OFF THE HOOK. I AM GLAD HE IS BACK AND HE CAME BACK CORRECT. I REALLY LOVE HIS VOICE AND THE SONG""CRY"" BEGINS WITH ONE OF MY FAVORITE TUNES ""SARAH SMILE"". ALL I CAN SAY IS YOU GO BOY AND I LISTEN TO IT EVERY NIGHT BEFORE I GO TO BED AND I TAKE IT TO WORK WITH ME EVERYDAY."
2,Skip this one!,"I don't know what I was thinking when I ordered this one....I thought it would be another hot romance like Sheik. Unfortunately I found that this nocel was written way back in the eighties. The story consists of one contrived situation after another, and I found no chemistry between Mark and Christa. As a result the innumerable love scenes had me yawning away. I only finished the book because I paid for it with my hard earned money!"
2,Vista users beware!!!,"Though not entirely the fault of Micro Innovations, Vista users will have nothing but trouble with this mouse. The packaging specifically states ""Vista Compatible"" but you have to really work to get it to work. Vista is terrible at recognizing USB mice, and there isn't a clear solution out there. Once I finally got this mouse to work, it only lasted a month before Vista no longer recognizes it. I have yet to find a solution that works.When it does work, it is quite user friendly. While small, it is still easy to operate. One drawback that I have found is that with frequent use, the retracting hub is harder to lock in place."
4,Works great,Good price and tracks well. The only negative is flimsiness of the cord but this applies to most minis.
1,"I mean cheap, not unexpensive","Light and compact. It would've been good, but scroll wheel broke within a month of occasional use."
1,Simply Awful,"While there may be some excuse for this book, as it is dated, it is simply one of the most ill-infomred, poorly written texts ever to appear in the field of spirituality. There are so many completely outrageous, ridiculous and silly statements, misinformation, absurd leaps of logic, that it would take a whole book just to review them. In short, the authors gliby ""wise-acre"" there way through the subject, without haven taken the trouble to do a minimal amount of research or effort. Note that they are students of the famous Rudi, one of the great charlatans of our time."
3,Great CD,Great CD with a good mix of Brazilian tech music. Viviani Godoy voice is spectacular I will recommend this CD.
3,Not bad content but.......,"They repeat the same information over and over and over again. How many times can they tell us the Common language runtime can seamlessly integrate with other languages. I feel like they repeat the same information every chapter. Its sort of nice b/c its in my head now, everything the CLR does, but I could have written cue-cards."
1,Not enough information for Intermediate or Advanced Develope,This book doesn't have information for expert level. Some of the information are repeated within few chapters. I guess Wrox should reduce the number of authers for a book or atleast the authers should review others chapters before publish.
4,"Horror movie soup, with good results","A fun, fast passed horror movie, Evil City deals with several reporters quest for the mythical city of Eteron, a city so evil that the traces of it have been wiped away. The more clues the reporters find, the more they become intrigued, until they find the fabled city under the mist.However, the sinister truth of the city might even be worse than the reporters believed. Zombies, Government Soldiers, and a mysterious priest all seem dedicated to no one making it out alive.This is a fun, odd combination of other horror movies such as Tales from the Crypt (70's edition), 28 Days Later, I Know What You Did Last Summer and more. Over all, the film is entertaining, if some what short at a scant 83 minutes."
2,Get a Logitech MX518,"You just cant say enough about how bad these extra 4 (2 rocker) buttons are. Unpressable, unprogramable, unfeelable, unfindable, as somebody else said, they are really useless, and thats a fact. I want extra buttons that have uses on my mouse.I sent mine back and got the MX518. 'Cant tell you how much better the buttons work, because you wouldnt believe it in comparison. Better mouse software. Better grip & feel. Fast enough.Put lights in your computer case, because these 2 dont look that good anyway. There are unusual & unattractive outlines inside the mouse that keep them from really shining through clearly. Dont know why they had to do that and spoil the potential better looks.Razer makes a great aluminum mouse pad worth getting, but it is not cheap like mousepads usually are!"
3,lights out!,the physical of the mouse its self is the same like most other razor mouse. the color how ever is where it shines. the mouse uses infared light to detect so there is no red light (or any other color) other than the blue which is great. however one of the blue LED lights inside is broken after a few months i had it. so now it glows not so bright blue but sometimes the broken LED light flickers on for a fraction of a second. weird but i like it.
2,"Good sensitivity, But....!","This mouse has good sensitivity and is lightweight. It is also customizable. The big draw back is that the mouse is a little too narrow and small. You get more stress on your wrist, because you can't rest it as well on the mouse. Another thing is that the side buttons are horribly placed to the point where you have to rearrange your your hand to use them. I'm going back to using my Logitech MX1000 laser mouse..it's much better than this one for gaming even if it is heavier."
2,GOOD BUT VERY FRAGILE (PLEASE dont delete my post THANK YOU!),"THE USB LINE OF THIS MOUSE IS NOT VERY DURABLE!,ESPECIALLY THE USB TIP THAT CONNECT TO THE MOUSE,EASY TO BREAK SO DONT PULL IT OR STREATH IT OFTEN IT WILL BE FINE,THE CLICKABLE BOTTON HAVE A SWEAT PROTECTION ON IT WHICH HELPS SWEAT FROM GETTING INTO THE MOUSE. VERY FAST REACTION TIME WHICH IS A PLUS, BUT THIS MOUSE IS ONLY BUILD FOR SMAILL HANDS, IF YOU HAVE BIG HANDS DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE!!!"
2,Mouse detection on powerup was hit & miss,"It looks and feels nice but due to the excessive power drain of the mouse on startup, the mouse would more often than not, fail to be detected. (The mouse requires high inrush current to start and it would be current limited by the USB port)I returned it to Amazon and purchased a Logitech MX510 instead and it works flawlessly."
4,"Exceptional responsiveness, Less than average durability","Diamondback Game Mouse Plasma is probably the most responsive mouse I have ever used. Extemely fast and accurate. However, this is our second one. The first one had the cable detach at the USB connector under minor stress.I have had other mice that were subjected to similar incidents (and more severe) without giving out. This is a great mouse and I would recommend it.However,it needs to be handled with a bit more care than the average mouse."
3,Much worse than I expected. I prefer MX510 over this,"I bought this mouse to replace my one-year old MX510.I expected a big improvement of my performance in gamessuch as CS 1.6. However, it turned out that I was totally ripped off. This mouse is even worse than MX510. If you are not left-handed, I strongly recommend you to go with logitech MX series. The only bad thing for MX510 is that its feets are easy to worn out. But at least you can play pleasantly for about half a year.This diamond mouse is notorious for its right button. In CS 1.6, I often accidentally clicked the right button when I fire against nearby enemies, and you know if I happen to use M4 I will die immediately. So I have to intentionally lift several of my fingers and be very careful not to touch the right button when I use M4 in CS 1.6."
5,Very comfortable,"I'm a gamer. I used to use a wireless. This mouse is MUCH better. First off, the wireless mouse made it seem like the fps was a LOT lower. I got my Diamondback today, put it in... the game, when moving around, was SO much smoother.3/4 of the side buttons are easy for me to reach - the two on the left, and the farther one on the right.I can move my mouse across the screen real fast without the aiming 'glitching out'. Not sure if it's common in wired mice, but it was a pain with the wireless."
5,AMAZING BUY,"This mouse is the best mouse i have ever had or used! IF you haven't use this mouse, your life is not complete! You need to go buy this mouse right now, i have had it for a month and it hasn't fropped a beat. Good mouse, great price."
4,Diamond Back Razer Plasma,its a good mouse and i like it the glowing color goes good with my case and easy to use
4,Diamondback Game Mouse,"Plus: Looks great next to my Saitek keyboard. VERY responsive.Minus: Feels a bit small. Side buttons have a poor design; Too easy to click the wrong one(s). Too responsive; MUST use the included driver. Many other wierd problems (freeze's, ect.) may be related to use of my KVM switch, which they say you can NOT use with this mouse. Will likely go back to my MS mouse."
5,Razer,"Over a year, still looks new, love it! The adjustable speed is crucial now that I have it. Really makes jumping from rifle to tank controls nice. One problem...very rarely I have to start computer up a second time to grab the mouse. This may be a problem with my own setup and nothing to do with the drivers given. I would strongly recommend this mouse."
4,I waited for mouse of smaller weight.,I waited for mouse of smaller weight. The performance is good. The bellboys extra do not convince to me.
3,"Good Mouse, but Not for Me","I purchased both the Razer Diamondback mouse and then the Razer eXactMat mouse mat/pad. I love the mat and its size and texture, and it worked great with my old IR mouse, but not with my Logitech Laser mouse (it, for some reason, failed to move the cursor over the center 1"" or so of the mousepad). I tried the Diamondback, and operation was very nice, but I just couldn't get used to the narrow design, and almost impossible to click side buttons.I traded the Diamondback in on the Razer Death Adder, and have been very pleased with it. Shape and feel are good, side buttons large enough to use, looks cool."
2,Not of much help,Not the worst book to have. But certainly there are much better books available like Advanced ASIC Chip Synthesis Using Synopsys by Himanshu Bhatnagar.
1,too expensive...would have bought if Dover published it..,learn logic synthesis == Himanshu BhatnagarUse logic synthesis on real word designs == synopsys reference manualsdevelop logic synthesis == fabio somenzi and gary hachtel or srinivas devadas and kurt keutzerPersonally the people who can constrain their design's best are logic designers and people who can delve deeper into the tool are algorithm developers themselves (and those guys dont have so much time!). These half wits will end up killing you...
5,For cornet players.,If you ever played cornet solos in high school (or otherwise) this record is a must for your collection. It's too bad that Gerard Schwartz stopped recording!
3,The game is slow in more than one way,"After playing a lot of Diablo II, I was looking for something that might require a bit more strategy and skill. (I used to play lots of RPGs.) While you will find this in Balder's Gate II, I found the pace of the game very slow. Perhaps Diablo II has conditioned me to expect a faster paced RPG. Just be forewarned. Also, Balder's Gate II was supposed to address some of the player's complaints about the slow pace of Balder's Gate I, but little has changed with Balder's Gate II.Note, I've been playing Balder's Gate II with OSX 10.1.1 on a G4-450 with 384 MB of RAM and a 32 MB Radeon. The game is very sluggish, even when reducing the game resolution, etc."
4,The rpg to get. Period.,"This is the rpg to get. the problem isn't getting it back of the shelf after the other games get boring, the problem's when you can pull the disc out of your computer in the first place! The shelf life for this game is amazing, I have played through it multiple times- always as the same wizard... eventually one time I tried using only ranged weapons with all but one of my party members after I maxed out all their levels. I killed pretty much everything in 1 or 2 vollys. But I'm not here to tell you about my gaming experiences. DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITH CHEATS!!! It ruins the purpose of doing the deep sidequests, and it makes the storyline quite linear- which sucks.Overall- Best rpg ever."
3,"Nice, but slow in OSX","I had this for the PC, but when I got a PowerBook G4 550 to carry when I travel, I decided to get the Mac version of BGII. I was looking forward to a game which claimed to be able to run under OSX instead of having to boot into OS9, but under OSX, the multiplayer game is so slow it's unbearable...the mouse is jerky and the players walk pretty slowly. Under OS9 with the same settings, but running the OS9 version, it ran perfectly.Other than that, the other reviews probably cover the gameplay..."
1,"Superb game, unplayable in OSX","This is my favorite game ever, bar none. It is so very disappointing that it was ported to OSX this poorly. You will literally spend half of your time with this game re-loading from a crash or freeze. And that's IF you get it to run in the first place. It has so many install-related issues that many people simply give up trying (according to forums). Buy and play this game in Windows (I cannot BELIEVE I just wrote that!)"
3,It is 100% correct - this is NOT the music used in the film,"the music from the soundrack AS USED IN the film is far, far more atmospheric and interesting, but sadly this film came out during the height of the disco boom '78 and the soundtrack released by (Casablanca? who were at the forefront of the disco roadshow) reflected the way they thought the record would sell. Giorgio Moroder won the Oscar for his score on this film but the version on the CD is a remixed and revamped version meant for the clubs rather than a true representation of the music contained in the film - It would probably be financially ridiculous, but wouldnt it be great if there was to be a release of the music as used in the film rater than the fangled remixed version............"
2,you call this a soundtrack??,"I'm a big fan of the movie and loved the music in it; so I thought the soundtrack would be good too. Buyer beware: the music contained herein is NOT the same as in the movie. It's a lousy disco remix on most of them, and a lot of the tunes in the movie are conspicuously absent."
1,Horrible,"Loved this movie, but the music was horrible. I had to laugh when I saw there was actually a buyable soundtrack. Like a lot of rotten soundtracks from 1970's movies (the Charles Bronson Death Wish series comes to mind), this was overly synthesized to the point of sound effects...camera pan-out...sound: OOOWWAAAHHHHHHHHhhhhhh, pan in: WWEEEEeeeeeee. Silence would have been better."
4,Disco album to Turkish prison classic,"Yes, as has been mentioned, this is not the same music you hear in the film, but slightly different arrangements desiged to be sold as an album. Like Cat People, the disc has some gems that differ greatly from the originals but still make it worthwhile.Don't know why they don't release more music, but what's here is a must for the Moroder fan. Chase is the main draw, absolutely genius tune that was somehow written into a film about a guy being beaten in a Turkish prison.Chase is still remixed today, that disco-Kraftwerk feel, the trance-like rhythm, the masterfully cheesy keyboards. Moroder was on top of his game for the next few years, cranking up his drum machine and using the fattest synths.Far more uplifting than the film, it's the best ever soundtrack to a story about life in a Turkish prison, complete with random beatings, madness, and much more than the viewer would care to know."
3,Gift for a friend,I got this as a gift for a friend I used to know. He seemed to like them but I haven't talked to him in a long time.
5,For Adults and Students!,This is a great story! Some adults that I shared the story with enjoyed the book a great deal and I look forward to using it in my classrooms!
1,Gives child bad ideas!,"We received this book as a gift and it's going into the Goodwill pile soon. The boy in the story defiantly says he doesn't want to go to bed so his Dad just goes to bed himself and lets the boy stay up all night. The boy gets a little scared but plays until he falls asleep on the living room floor. His Dad carries him up to bed around 5am. After reading this book, my 4 year old decided he wanted to try the same thing. I'm all about teaching proper bedtime routines and any book that interferes with that is not for us!"
4,Review Beg ASP.Net using C#,"The books content on ASP.Net is excellent and provides the reader with a good foundation to start developing on the .Net platform. The range and depth are good for the beginning series that Wrox(The Red Book) puts out. The book progresses so that even a novice web programmer can learn the fundamentals of ASP.NET. However, I was unable to give the book 5 stars due to some lack in details in typos. Even with a few mistakes, (authors are human), the content of the examples is excellent. If you have any problems with an example it's always good to check or post new entries to the book errata section on Wrox's own site. Also, if you are trying to learn all about C# you would be better off purchasing a book that deals only with C#. This book's title gives you exactly what it says and then some."
2,Missing critical sections and disorganized,"At first, this seemed like a good book. It introduced ASP.NET well and brought me quickly up to speed. As a reference, however, this book is sorely lacking. There is no definitive list of all the ASP.NET server controls and their properties for instance. There are only a couple examples of SQL Server connectivity, and the configuration chapter is almost dead last - long after many topics and examples which require knowledge of configuration are covered. I frequently felt left in the dust. I think it is a typical problem of Wrox books. With so many authors it is hard for there to be a consistent message and progressive flow. Different authors assume different levels of knowledge when it gets to their section of the book. The result is a jarring experience that often left me feeling left behind."
2,CODE DOES NOT WORK!!,"BE CAREFUL WITH THIS ONE. THE CODE IN THE BOOK AND THE DOWNLOADED CODE DO NOT WORK. CH02 READIND XML FILE IS INCORRECT. THIS,IN MY HUMBLE OPINION, IS VERY BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Quadrophenia,Not exactly the quality that I would have hoped for but it's ok. Will be getting it mounted and see how that looks. Thank you.
4,"A fun, light farce","Once again, Elinor Lipman has created a funny, light story about women--in this case, three sisters whose lives are disrupted when the ex-fiance returns thirty years after abandoning Adele, the eldest. Lipman has created a thoroughly believable--and detestable--anti-hero in Nash Harvey/Harvey Nash, a rogue who sponges off women and never seems to understand that he is not nearly as charming as he thinks he is. Readers who enjoy peering into the private lives of mature women will appreciate the sisters' struggles to deal with Nash and with their own middle-of-life romances and lack thereof. Real, fully developed characters and a speedy plot make this a read-in-a-sitting romantic comedy."
3,"nice read, but not my favorite Lipman","This was an enjoyable read. The characters are funny, engaging and familiar. The story is primarily about 3 sisters who have all settled into spinsterhood and live together. Then this guy, Harvey Nash, a true ladies man, comes back into their lives, supposedly seeking forgiveness from Adele, the sister he'd left at the alter many many years ago. His presence ripples into their supposed contentment, with intriguing results. Nothing truly sensational happens, just a series of related events that kind of fold into eachother.This isn't my favorite Lipman, but it's not because it's written any worse or the characters less engaging than those in ""The Inn at Lake Divine"" or ""Isabel's Bed"" (my two favorites). It's because the characters were simply older, and their story less familiar. Therefore, it was more a glimpse into the lives of others only, rather than something I felt I could immediately relate to.Nevertheless, I definately recommend it."
3,A Let-Down From the Elinor Lipman High,"After reading ""The Way Men Act,"" ""Isabel's Bed,"" and ""The Inn at Lake Devine,"" ""The Ladies' Man"" was a HUGE let-down. Elinor Lipman is funny, creative, and interesting, but i found this book to be of a lower caliber than her previous work. I became addicted to her books through her vivid characters, and though the characterizations remain vivid, I never became attached to the players in this book. Maybe there were too many of them, maybe they all did too many despicable things. The three sisters are indeed interesting, but I did not feel that I got to know any of them very well. However, the trip into Harvey's brain was something else."
3,The Ladies' Man,I found this to be good reading. However I see it as sterotyping women. I know this is a new age but I can't get with all this one night stand stuff. These are the times when women can and are very much taking care of themselves have no need to succumb to such degradation.
2,WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU ELINOR LIPMAN?!,"As an avid fan of Ms. Lipman's ""The Inn at Lake Devine,"" and ""The Way Men Act,"" I was excited to read ""The Ladies' Man,"" and the first few chapters did not disappoint, but then it went flat, and I found my mind wandering and then I thought the thing you hope never to think while reading- ""I don't care about these people."" Let's hope this is a minor setback for Ms. Lipman- her true fans deserve better!"
2,A disappointment following Inn at Lake Devine,Loved Inn at Lake Devine and looked forward with anticipation to reading another Lipman novel. I still remember Inn... months later but can hardly remember the characters in Ladies Man just a couple of weeks after finishing. I did not find the plot particularly exciting or interesting but did enjoy Kathleen and Lorenzo's relationship. I will purchase another Lipman novel hoping it will equal Inn at Lake Devine -- as yet none have.
4,Light romantic farce,"Cheerful romantic farce about middle-aged singles in New England, centering on the return of a philandering jingle-writer who returns from California ostensibly to make amends to the stuffy spinster he jilted thirty years before.The book would be boring if it only offered a bitter female perspective on ""how come guys never call"", but it goes beyond the anger and finds some sympathy, compassion, and even a little admiration. The titled character is sympathetic, despite the fact 'he lies as easily as you or I would say our prayers.' The other characters are lovingly rendered as well, offering nine further examples of how to avoid intimacy and fall into your fifties in an unmarried state.Lipman's dry humor, and her crisp, easy style, make this a quick and enjoyable read."
1,Very disappointing,"I picked up this book drawn to it by its cover and reviews. There was absolutely nothing noteworthy about it. The characters were ridiculous. I cannot understand how anyone could call this book charming or witty. The women who fall for the title character are unbelievably dense. Even more unbelievable is the way in which, throughout the book, characters allow Nash to insinuate himself into their lives. I found this book dull and a waste of valuable reading time."
2,Not her best,"I didn't quite feel Elinor Lipman got it together here. The plot was, at best, sketchy, the characters were shallow, and the dialog laked much of her usual sparkle. Writing in the present tense was not easy to adjust to, and this took the shine out of the first two chapters until I was able to adjust to it. I have to say, that I struggled a bit. The Ladies' Man was very easy to put down.Maybe the next one?"
1,A mistake!,"What a nasty piece of work is Elinor Lipman's book - as well as the title character. Why the author thought that a reader would or could care for such an unappealing, slimy toad is beyond me. Oh, I know - an anti-hero! But, if memory serves, an anti-hero should ""play against"" positive foils; however, this book is peopled with folks who run the gamut from self-absorbed to whiny. There is not one likable, nay mature, person revealed. (Oh well - maybe the youngest sister and her boyfriend.) It's the story of a liar and his relations and relationships with as sorry a bunch of unappetizing characters to appear in fiction for quite a while. I usually like Lipman's work - hence my purchase of this one. Why such a talented writer has crafted such a dreadful work is a puzzlement."
5,Great stories for Toddlers,"This book may be targeted for older child, but my 2 year old loves the stories. They contain alot of images he can relate to and the stories are easy to understand. His favorite is Mr. Fixit."
5,best mistake ever,I find myself getting lots of books online and not knowing whether they will be well received or not. This one was definitely a hit - my 3 and 5 yr. old both loved it and begged to be able to take it to bed. We had to take turns!
5,A happy book.,Bobby liked everything about this book. Especially that Huckle and Lowly were best friends. He also liked the bike bell that says cuckoo!
4,Very nice panini press,"It works perfectly well. I have two minor complaints. One is that there is no real on/off switch. If you have it plugged in, and the heat dial at minimum, it still heats. That's important to be aware of. It's not your ordinary toaster, which doesn't do anything unless you push down the slider. Second problem is MUCH less important. The clip that's supposed to hold the top and bottom together in storage is totally worthless. Just don't depend on it.That being said, it works very nicely as a panini press. The lid is flexible, and has a heat proof spot where you can tilt it to accomodate the thickness of your panini. The heat dial is generally accurate, so if you follow your instincts or the little cookbook, things turn out well. It's easy to clean up. I don't have enough room on the counter to let it out, but like most DeLonghi stuff, the style is very nice."
5,pompei,Friends - The Complete Series Collectioni bought this as a gift for my son and his wife for christmas! they were very pleased!! thanks
4,Good but not great shape,"The transaction was good, the box of the collection was a little messed up, the corners bend and all but it was good."
5,Good Quality. No problems.,I received this product well in time and I had no issues with the DVDs. They are original.
2,buyer beware,i did not realize these were gonna be copies. they dont work in my dvd player. i can use my ps2 or portable dvd to watch. i guess you'd say you get what you pay for.
1,Don't buy anything from this vendor,I receive the friend series which seem at the beginning to be in good condition. When I played the discs I relize that they weren't original. None of the discs played good. I tried to contect the sender but he never responded. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR
1,Complete garbage,The company ShopNShip was listed as the seller. Turns out it was someone selling a gift given to them. Disk 13 was missing. Some of the episode titles were on the wrong episodes. There are glue marks on the disks and they lock up while watching. The seller said that she could not fix the problem cause she only had one copy and it was a gift. Totally looks like she illegally burned these disks.
3,Split opinion,"The service on my order was great... got here in good shape and quickly.However, the manufacturer's packaging leaves a lot to be desired... definitely the economy version.The series of Friends in one sense is a fantastic excursion with 6 friends and their inter-related experiences. It is a witty, well written humorous sitcom; however, there is another side that sneaks right in alongside all the fun. It heavily promotes pornography through constant references to it, and the ""acceptable"" use of it among the friends; it boldly promotes homosexuality; and it definitely throws sex into the level of a handshake: ""Hi, nice to meet you, want to have sex?"" It is implied through action more than spoken, thouh there are plenty of verbals!Definitely keep it away from the young and impressionable members of the household!KC"
2,AWESOME PRODUCT/HORRIBLE SELLER,FRIENDS season is AWESOME BUT I have gone through 3 seasons and 3-4 disks were damaged. It was also missing a disk on season 1. I would NOT advice anyone to buy from this seller. FRIENDS though is GREAT
5,Excellent!!!,perfect quality for best price...it even comes packaged better as the normal 10 season series...its worth it
5,Friends - Complete Series DVD Collection,"Great deliver and quality of product.Goods in original condition when arrived, sealed as advertised."
5,Together Time,Watching Friends is quality time for mother and two daughters ages 15 and 13. The cost is worth the interaction. Lots of fun.
5,cool stuff,"This is an awsome collection! My family and I love the packaging, the way the seasons are organized, and the very cool extras. We highly recommend this complete set to all Friends fans out there!"
2,Friends DVS,Some of the DVD's Strucking and not going by chapter by chapter.Some DVD's Quality is not at all good.
1,Friends - The Complete Series Collection,"The entire fifth season was missing. No problem, I can purchase one season. There was a CD missing from the fourth season. And a CD missing from the sixth season. In order to have a complete set of the first six seasons, I will have to purchase three years!"
4,FRIENDS! (:,"I love friends and thats why i bought this! The only thing is, i wouldve liked more bloopers and it takes so long to ship!!!! lol but it was worth it, i watch it all the time! It has good quality and is great for any collector."
4,No surprises,"I bought this box set for a gift, and it came as advertised. No fuss, no muss. I like getting dependable and consistent performance from vendors who list on Amazon. This effort goes, our first with them thus far, goes into the relible category. No surprises!"
5,"Fantastic purchase, well worth the money.","I am extremely pleased with my box set of Friends. Had no issues with any of the discs, all were brand new and unscratched. The box itself was in pristine condition, and the booklet was included. I ordered straight from Amazon, and it was in my hands within a few days.If you are a fan of Friends, this is a must get!"
2,Not satisfied!!!,I was so excited about getting my own friends series as I so love the show. I was extremely dissapointed by the product. The DVD recording is not clear. Also multiple DV Ds skip and not work properly. Very dissapointed. Also returned my items and have not recieved my refund yet.
1,Very disappointed,"I ordered this boxed set of Friends and almost every disc is scratched and skips. I could actually see the scratches on these ""brand new"" discs. Beyond frustrated!!!"
5,Definitely a classic!,Beautiful set of a classic show. A must for anyone who was a fan of it or someone who would like to re-live the hit series.
4,Took two tries,"I bought the complete series because it dropped down to $114.99. I started watching the last few episodes and when I got to the second to last and last episodes, they wouldn't play! I'm lucky that I started at the end otherwise I might not have found that problem until months later. Since it was within 30 days, Amazon sent me a new one immediately. I didn't have to send the defective one back for a few weeks so I went through every disc to make sure there were no problems with this new set. There wasn't so I sent the defective one back. It would have been nice to get the perfect one first but everything is fine now. I recommend buying each season individually the day after Thanksgiving when they drop to less than $10 a season at other stores."
5,love it!,"Its compact (a big space saver). and the fact that the dvds are store in books, helps prevent misplacement of the dvds!"
4,Fabulous!,"So glad I belong to the people who didn't watch any episode of Friends prior to season 10! 9 whole seasons being discovered... And this is amazing to be able to get the whole collection in just one box (with a pamphlet and many special features).We didn't complete the box yet (40 discs!), but so far the Friends are a wonderful team, playing any situation brilliantly. Lot's of fun!The only snag (sadly had to put 4 stars for that) : two of the six discs we saw so far were damaged. While we took great care removing them from the box, two discs had scratches. One of them was not even readable. The scratch seems to be from the manufacturer [it's not some finger prints!). Amazon sent us a new box."
5,FRIENDS is the best!,"I had to return this item once due to missing discs, but Amazon was extremely quick in getting a new item sent to me. Worth the buy for sure!"
5,Excellent Purchase,Friends - The Complete Series CollectionI am so glad I bought this because I'm an avid fan of the series. EVERY time I watch I am either laughing or moved to tears. Plus it comes with a book all about the series. I LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!
5,Classic as always!,"First off I have to mention Marcell, classic Ross - what an addition to the cast. Phoebes one liners are once again astounding. Who would've thought a primate could provide the highlights of the season - humping Rachel's leg is comedic genius. This rates up there with the first season of Joey!"
1,missing a disc,I purchased a new copy of the complete series of Friends for my girlfriend and we found that one of the disc was a copy of another one. Now my girlfriend cant watch all the episodes and i have no way to return the item of get a replacement of the disc. I figured it would be a reliable product since i bought it from Amazon but was suprised to find the missing disc.
5,Friends box set,"Love the show and love the box set, arrived in a timely manner, seller was great and I would definately deal with this seller again!"
2,quick delivery but NOT NEW like i ordered,"ships quickly, however the items were NOT new...i went to the store and the box is totally different, the inside products weren't clean cut, they were sloppy and looked used and put together. discs didnt play well sometimes too.."
2,poor experiance with amazon,"I'm rating my experience poor. When I received the friends complete series collection in the mail the collectors case was ripped on one side and the other side was worn. I cant believe anyone who runs a buisness would let a product in that condition leave the store! As for the DVDs, LOVE THEM!!! Friends is the best!!!"
5,"Who doesn't love ""Friends""!?!",A super deal for an entire series with all the extras in one box. Very good quality. If you love the series you've got to own it!
5,Great Gift!,This made me a hero on Xmas! The DVD's bring back great memories of the first time we saw the programs. Shipping was super fast without any shipping upgrades.
1,the test of time,"David Schwimmer- Worst TV star of all time.Matt LeBlanc- Okay since he's playing himself.Chandler Bing- Sorry, I can't remember his real name...a close second to Schwimmer in the acting department.Courtney Cox-- Probably has no remaining enamel.Phoebe-- Endearing if you like the special olympics.Jennifer Aniston-- Ugh. What was the hype about? Bad actress playing the most white woman ever."
4,FRIENDS...FRIENDS...FRIENDS,"Well i think this a good oppurtunity to all FRIENDS lovers to buy this complete series collection. this will be having all the episodes of friends right from day one where Rachel is seen in her beautiful Wedding Dress to the last one where Monica and Chandler leave her appartment with Erica's new born Twins.all the love, fun, sex etc will be covered in betweem.i only have the tenyh season of FRIENDS but i m looking forward to buy this Collector's Edition."
1,puking time,"We human beings thrive on other people's stupidity because we like to feelsuperior to others. That's the reason why this junk was so successful. Thecharacters are 6 idiots: obnoxious, disgusting, stupid, ignorant, ridiculous, pathetic, pitiful, and what have you. And kudos for the producers because they selected actors/actresses that didn't have to change very much to go into character(Matthew Perry takes the first prize here). All of them failed miserably in subsequent enterprises: Perryin a show that praised cocaine(imagine!), Kudrow in a ridiculous reality show, LeBlanc in ""Joey"", and etc. There must be something wrong with a country where ""Friends"", Will Smith, Eddie Murphy, etc are hits!"
2,not my kind of friendship,"Greetings fellow amazonians I picked this up because my trailermate mongo has been going through some growing pains and I wanted to use these dvd's to teach him about friendship (he was ""pushing"" a midget clown with his rascal when he accidently ran him over and said he thought he was helping the clown out since he had little legs). Little did I know what this show was all about! I spent most of the night explaining what ""on a break"" was about and how by the end of the show these people were all friends ""with benefits"". Personally I didn't think it was my place to explain the birds and the bees to him, but this show brought out all the questions. I think next time I will skip these ""friends"" and maybe go for a show like ""too close for comfort"" where I know I will get asked a lot less questions"
1,The worst garbage ever.,"That was a period at the end of the title so that's that. Justterrible. Whenever this is on, I hear the canned laughter and I wonderwhy. They don't tell jokes or do anything funny. All they do is saysomething stupid that makes them look like an idiot and then the cannedlaughter comes on. Wow. I'm not 5 years old anymore. I'm not mentallydisabled and it takes more than that to make me laugh. Not one of theactors or actresses is likable. I will always purposely try to avoidany show or movie that any of them will ever be in. They might be goodat acting but only at acting like they are retards. I have had enough.You have the iq of a 5 year old if you think this show is funny. PureGarbage."
2,Most Overrated Series Ever,"This is probably the most overrated and overhyped series of all time. The few episodes I watched lacked originality and were just cheap copies of early comedies. A poorly written and poorly acted series that was populated with pretty faces. Watching it on DVD reminds one of this and begs the questions, ""is there a better way to spend this kind of money?"""
4,"Good, Solid Product.",Pros:All ten seasons with unedited episodes.Cons:The discs contain different artwork on the front of each DVD and DO NOT say what season they are. A permanent marker can fix this though.
2,scared off of complete series box set,"After extensive reading of other reviews, I decided to buy the individual season boxes for the following reasons:1) too many reviews talked about defective discs that skipped or simply do not play at all,2) I wanted the seasons in sequence - not scattered across several discs - ie out of sequence.Buying the indivial season boxes cost me apx $42 more, however, it is worth having the episodes in sequence and reliable discs."
1,The movies are good the seller was bad,"I wrote a review for this box set back in January. I ordered form the seller High Tech Edges. Many of the discs did not work!! I contacted the seller and never got any response. Do NOT buy from this seller eventually Amazon had to get involved and issue me a refund. If the movies had worked I would have been extremely happy with the product, because I love friends."
1,complain,Where is my product? i've been waiting for over a month now and it was suposed to arrive more than a week ago and its not here yet. When it's going to arrive?
5,Friends DVD's,"I gave this to my wife for Xmas and she couldn't be happier. The 6 book organization is a little goofy, it would have made more sense to split it into 10 seasons. Do not have any scratched discs that people have complained about, at least not yet. If we discover something that won't play then will update review. Besides that, its Friends!! You can't really mess that up. This was MUCH less expensive than buying each season separately."
5,Great price!,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. This is her all time favorite show. The box set is very nice and the DVD quality is great. You cannot beat the price for a show that ran for 10 years!
4,Absolutely Amazing!,"This DVD set is amazing! I bought it for myself because I am a Friends fanatic, and I don't regret it one bit! Every disc is present and none that I have watched so far are scratched. I do sometimes wish they were organized by season instead of in just six different booklets, but the episode guide rocks! It even has background information on the show and pictures from the set! The box it comes in is great, perfectly sized to fit on a bookshelf, so it doesn't take up much space at all! I would recommend this to anyone who wants to buy this for themselves or as a gift!"
2,I was pleased until....,I was happy when I received my new box set. Until I noticed that I have 2 number 3's. I don't have the last episodes and now I have to try to find the last discs that I don't havem
3,Outer Case Broken,I ordered this dvd set for my husband as a gift...when we received it the outer case was broken but the dvd's are working fine..i think they should have taken better care while shipping.
3,"Love the show, but these DVDs are old.","The DVDs are old, so the picture quality is not good and sometimes they skip or have little blips. I wish this product wasn't so old!"
2,Order the Individual Seasons separately,"I love this show but I am returning this box set and decided to order the individual seasons separately for the following reasons:1) Many of the DVDs are faulty and skip even when they are not physically scratched. I tested this with multiple DVD players which have never given me problems before. If you check other reviews this quality control issue is pretty common with the DVDs from this box set. From what I can tell the quality control on the original season sets is much better.2) Disc 28 was missing and I got two copies of Disc 29 instead.3) The corner of the collector's box was broken/damaged when i received it.4) The discs are spread out through 6 scratch-prone cardboard-like sleeves for each character instead of by Season. Cute, but i don't want to have to open up a damn episode guide and look up the episode number to figure out which season i'm about to watch, while worrying about scratching my DVDs when taking them in and out of the sleeves."
1,Don't Buy Box Set...,"All I have to say is buy the individual seasons. I thought this was going to be a great buy... great price and compact! However, I have not played one disk yet that has not skipped, stopped playing, or returned to the menu in the middle of an episode. I have tried this on multiple DVD players and it does the same thing on every player. I am extremely disappointed with this box set and wish I would have bought the individual seasons. Save your $150 or whatever you are going to pay and put it to better use!"
3,The packaging is disappointing,Missed out in the awesome wooden box from last year.And settled for this guy here. I love Friends and at least I have a complete set finally.But the packing is truly disappointing. Cheap cardboard that looks like it won't last more than a few openings. 5 stars for the show. 0 stars for the packaging.And the thing that really gets me is the discs are divided into 6 sets of disc holders. One holder for each Friend is cute and novel...but a failed gimmick...there are 10 freaking seasons man. It makes no sense that each season wouldn't have it's own holder or box.I put on a brave smile because I got this as a gift. But I was really dissapointed with the packing.They had perfection with the wooden box..why mess with it.If you are purely interested in only the contents of the show...get this. If you want something that feel authentic....skip this cheap knock off and get the real deal wooden box set while it's still available at some places.
2,IMPORTANT INFO,"***IMPORTANT***If your friends complete series did not come with the booklet, it is very likely that you got a fake one.My husband got this set for me as a gift from a seller on amazon website and we were surprised to see it was brand new for only $100.When we got the product, we realized it was fake. The colors were faded, the dvds were packed in little plastic bags and it was missing all the extras that the set comes with.BE AWARE WHEN BUYING THESE. SOME SELLERS MIGHT BE SELLING FAKE ONES.There is a forum of this product on the end of this page with the topic ""missing book"" that says more about this."
5,Great series,No problem with the DVDs. I was excited to get such a good price for so many shows - it could have been more expensive.
5,The Ultimate Gift For the Ultimate Friends Fan!!!,"The best price that I could find on this COMPLETE FRIENDS SERIES anywhere.My 19 year old daughter only requested this for her Christmans gift as she's a super fan. It comes packaged in a classy box,that includes a book with quick synopsis of each episode. Audio commentary is another feature. The synopsis also lets you know which episodes that had a guest star. Money well spent for the ultimate Friends fan!"
5,great box set,"Well done box set. I'm especially pleased with the packaging. The DVDs are in paperboard envelopes instead of irritating plastic containers. The whole set fits together very nicely and there's not too much extra dumb stuff, just a book. Pretty happy overall."
3,Some poor-quality DVDs but great show,"I purchased this boxed set because it was a great deal on Amazon, but several of the episode have a ""grainy"" picture quality and one episode has a poor sound-quality. If you like the show, this boxed set is the best deal in owning the entire series."
2,Not Impressed,I ordered this as a gift for my girlfriend. However the box came slightly damaged and it was obvious it was not from shipping. Also the discs came all mixed up and out of order. I wasn't very impressed with its quality. However I may buy CD cases so that the disks do not become scratched!
4,Great deal for whole series,"Watching reruns on TBS/TNT wasn't like having the whole series at your fingertips, having the ability to choose an episode or season whenever you wanted to watch it. Good price for this item that arrived in sealed/unopened packaging, speedy service/shipping, would look forward to doing business with this vendor again. Thanks!"
3,Good for the money.,"I was weary purchasing this because a lot of the reviews state that the discs skip and it was packaged cheap. I had ordered a series collection before from amazon of a different show and it was packaged smilar and had no problems, so I decided to buy Friends anyway. Most of the discs did work, however there was 2 - 3 episodes that had a bit of skipping. But considering there are 236 episodes plus and maybe two of the episodes didnt work at all and another episode skipped and I only caught half, I mean, probaly still a good deal. Also note that this goes WAY on sale on cyber monday so if want an even better deal, wait til then. We purchased on black friday and then cyber monday came and it was $20 cheaper still! So heads up on that."
4,Friends: the Complete Series Coll,"Ok, el paquete está bonito, la caja es elegante pero de mala calidad, se rompe con facilidad, aun no he visto el material, espero que no me de problemas, la serie es de mis favoritas."
2,DVD's not original,"The DVD's were not original....All original DVD's come in dual layer format(DVD9, 7-8 GB). These were single layer DVD's(around 4.35 GB)....Moreover, all DVD's had a melted glass like substance near the center, which I think was some sort of manufacturing defect. I suspected that these are not original, so returned the package.The seller however was co-operative and made an immediate refund. Hence the 2nd star.If you buy, do confirm that the DVD's are dual layer.-Nikhil"
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed when I had saved this for an Anniversary gift & when we opened it & put it in to watch there were episodes that would not play & other episodes that skipped, then I tried it in another DVD player & it did the same thing. So, I was dissatisfied wih the product & am tying to begin the process to return it, but the seller doesn't have a return policy or phone number to be reached at."
1,MUCH Cheaper at Target,"I purchased this item for my nephews birthday last month thinking i was getting a good deal. I paid, $149.99 for the collection. I was at Target a few days ago and saw the same exact collection for $99.99. So check the stores before purchasing from Amazon. I felt ripped off."
1,where is the seller?,"This transaction started out ok, promise to deliver within a few days, then it went weeks later, even though this was paid for thru Paypal. This DVD set arrived in a brown envelope shipped from China, the outside envelope was fine, but the DVD storage box is crushed. I requested another storage box, have not yet heard back, and now her Amazon storefront is unavailable. I wish I would of purchased from a more established seller with a better attitude towards serving her customers for this gift purchase."
3,Gotta admit I was a little confused at first,"My husband got this for me as a surprise and I was really excited. I was a little confused at first though because the seasons arent broken up, it has six sections with a few disks in each that makes up the series. So if you have a fave episode you have to go into the booklet and find it. That is the only con I have seen so far, as far as the disks not playing I havent had an issue with it like I have before with DVD's I bought from Amazon (Ive had three seasons of How I Met Your Mother and one of House that were totally ruined before I even got them). I am glad that (for now) there is no problems finally with a purchase that actually doesnt skip :)"
4,Great Show/Great Price,"It's FRIENDS - where have you been...? If you don't know this show, then you probably need to get this set."
3,It came in 6 different sections rather than 10,"Friends is a must have for those who enjoyed watching friends.. I love it.. the only this is I wish it was packaged severally according to Season rather than combing seasons together. It comes in 6 different sections rather than 10, as i expected it would be. Other than if you love Friends it's a must have!!"
4,arrived very soon,"arrived sooner than a week or so, good service.I had a little upset 'cause it said ""NEW"" but It's kind of used. However, the videos' quality is ok."
5,DVD Series,"I received my order ahead of the date stated which was a great surprise as this was a gift item. The details of the product did not do the actual item justice. The series arrived in an excellent collectors box and the 10 seasons are carfully split between the six characters of the show; with each containing a little over two seasons. Each of the character cases has their current picture on the front and their picture during the tv series on the back. In addition, the character cases are hard bound and sturdy with sleeves for each of the cd's appointed to that character. Also included in the series box is a very nice soft cover book of pictures and stories from the show and the characters. This turned out to be an excellent keepsake for a beloved tv series and was full of extras that were unexpected. It is a very nice package and I would highly recommend it to any fan of the Friends Series. You won't be disappointed."
5,Great DVD's at a great Price,This is a must have if you want to purchase the Friends series. Why pay $20 and up per a season when you can get the whole series for under $165 with shipping?
5,Highly satisfied !,"I received all the friends episodes in 40 discs, all runs well and the packaging is amazing ! the dvd prints are very good. I'm highly satisfied."
4,Beautiful Gift :),I gave this gift to a friend and what a perfect gift it is :) it is an amazing collectible for all F.R.I.E.N.D.S. fans... Just that it is heavy !!! :)
1,Worst Service Ever-,"This seller took my money right away, and NEVER delivered the product. They never answered my emails asking ""where's my stuff"" I believe Amazon knows this seller has done this to several other people, and doesn't do anything to stop it from happening a gain. Life is hard all over right now. I need my money back. I would recommend NEVER, NEVER buying from this seller, and I am totally disappointed in the Amazon."
1,Many episodes are not watchable on discs included in the collection I received!,"I bought this as a gift for my wife. Unfortunately, by the time we started having problems with more than one truly bad disc, we missed the return window. I wish I had taken a closer look at the reviews to realize it was not worth purchasing. My wife loves the show, so I will likely purchase the content on Instant Video in the future."
3,Not Official DVD Set,"The DVDs are generally fine, although this is NOT the official DVD Friends boxset. It's a copy and doesn't come with the standard booklet that comes with the real DVDs (although it's really not a big deal since that booklet has nothing useful in it but some glossy images and fluff). The DVDs are wrapped in a loose plastic container which was weird. But the DVDs work fine. Only complaints are the menu button only goes to the general disc menu, not the episode guides, and the DVDs will run repeatedly for hours on end unless you specifically turn it off. Also I think I'm missing disc 36. They should really say this is not the official licensed DVD!"
5,happy!!,product true to description. Shipping time good- quality better than expected. Will def order again!!! Thank You!!
2,DVDs,"I recently bought a set of dvds from this seller. The description was inaccurate. The DVDs were not sealed as promised and the condition was not accurate either. Also, some of the DVDs skip and one is so scratched it does not even play."
4,Friends Complete 10 Year Series,"The Friends 10 year complete season package was a great deal. Separately each season purchase would have been double the price I paid for the complete set. This was a brand new set, still in the box. I couldn't have asked for more."
1,This is only about the packaging,"If you are new to friends, there is another complete collection contains all 10 seasons in individual original boxes and a plexy glass limited edition total box. the benefits of that set is, you have all the original DVDs in original boxes which are very good and secure DVD case.In this newly release, DVDs are in sleeves which are open to surface damages and the set itself can easily be torn. there is only one bonus, the comemorative book which is not a big deal cause it's available to purchase individually"
1,Disappointed with the quality...,"I was really excited to get this box set, because I love the show. However, upon opening it, the case they come in was severely beat up. Literally falling apart. I was refunded 20% because of this, which I appreciated. Now that I have had a chance to start watching the DVD's I have realized the poor quality didn't stop at the box. Some of the DVD's won't even play! Some will play but a few of the episodes on the disc will not play at all. I think when you are spending this much on something it should at least work. Very disappointing!"
5,"""LETS HAVE A FRENASSANCE""","love FRIENDS<3333this is soooo worthwhile and so much cheaper than in stores like best buy, walmart, target... etc.it's AMAZING i love it :3nothing was scratched , nothing was broken everything was in perfect condition. LOVE IT."
3,"Duplicate Discs, Others Missing","I ordered this product brand new and received it with the clear packaging still on (or so I thought). However, I have duplicate copies of Disc 17 and am completely missing Disc 18. So I'm a little skeptical that I actually got a brand new product like it was advertised."
1,DOESN'T WORK,The 1'st DVD doesn't play the pilot episode. And the DVD starts skipping half way through. The second DVD is the same. Would NOT buy from this seller again.
3,defective discs and missing booklet,"So i bought this set a couple months or so ago, and just found the time to watch all the dvds. I noticed after the first couple seasons that some of the discs wouldn't play. They would either spin really loudly, spin loudly then stop, or just not spin at all. At first i thought it was my DVD drive that was the problem. I went back and looked through all the dvds, and every single one has minor scratches on it (didnt affect the playing), and the ones that wouldnt spin at all had very small chips along the edges of the discs, therefore not letting them spin properly or not spin at all. Its happened with quite a few of these discs and i am very disappointed. I dont know how to send it back or refund it without my receipt or anything, since its been awhile. I am also missing this so called ""booklet"" that was supposed to come with the set. After spending 150 bucks, this is a huge loss for me :( and im upset that i missed alot of the best episodes!"
4,"""Friends"" the complete series","The show was popular and we are enjoying the series again. Two problems with the DVD's. The music that accompanies the show sounds very sharp and liked coming from inside a can. Also, the background laughter is too loud and occasionally drowns out the actors words. I would have expected more for the cost of $186.00."
1,TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE,"Quality was terrible. Opened it and everything was literally falling apart. The CD's look really cheap too like ""bootleg china"" cheap. Was not satisfied at all and returned it. Bought the individual seasons instead. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COLLECTION. DEFINITELY NOT WORTH KEEPING."
2,I wouldnt recommend :(,"Friends is my favorite show of all time. I received this for Christmas and made it through the entire series within a few months. Unfortunately several discs skipped and Amazon said it was too late to return. I ended up going out and purchasing Season 2, 3, and 5 individually. Just go to Rasputins or Amazon and purchase the individual seasons USED for cheap!"
3,disappointed,"I had expected to be able to go to a menu and play any one episode that I wanted on a disc, but I was not able to do so. I could see a 30 second preview of any episode, but if I wanted to view the second episode or later ones, then I had to fast-forward through the disc. That seems a little ridiculous, especially for such a large purchase (the whole series). Each disc should contain a menu allowing the viewer to choose any one episode and go directly to it."
1,rubbish,48 episodes out of 236 (20%) can not be played. 6th and 7th season can not be played. on two dvd players it said that it could not be played in this region and on the x-box it said that it could not be played without licence code??? all dvd players and x-box are bought regularly and legally.feel cheated.
5,A great show,"If you like Friends a lot, you won't regret buying this package. End of story. I've owned it for a year and I still watch all episodes consistently. The purchase was well worth it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SET,Audio is dubbed horribly on many discs in the later seasons. No returns or exhanges allowed. Total waste of money on a faulty product.
4,Great for Friends Fans,"This set was purchased as a gift for a Friends fan, and they loved it. It's great that it includes all the seasons in one set, although it is a little pricey. The packaging is really nice - all the DVDs are organized within a larger box for easy storage. On the set I received, one corner of the outer storage box had begun to split. Not sure if that happened in shipment, or if it was pulled off the shelf that way. I didn't attempt to return for another set, because of the timeframe (too close to the holiday), and all the DVDs were unharmed."
5,"Friends, the complete series","The wife is loving it. A nice collection to enjoy by yourself or with ""Friends"". Maybe plan your own party"
5,It is what it is!,"If you enjoyed watching FRIENDS the first time around and in reruns, this may be for you. It was fun to watch specific episodes and then just play, ""pick a card, any card"" and then randomly select an episode."
1,Worst set ever,"This friends set was such a waste. The quality is horrible and almost every CD skips. And not just little skipping, it will skip entire episodes. Or multiple sections of an episode at a time. It's terrible. I hate that I have to spend more money on another set."
3,Incomplete,The complete collection arrived within a week which was great however several of the discs so far have been skipping and I am missing whole segments of a show. It is disappointing. I have not finished all 10 seasons yet so I am unsure how many are like this. So far I've encountered between 4-5 discs that skip even though they are brand new.
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"Do NOT buy this. I repeat do NOT by this. i was sooooo excited the day i got it in the mail. i immediately ordered a pizza and sat down watching my favorite show. when i got to the 3rd episode, it started skipping. didn't mind at all. then it started skipping again later on. i was trying to figure out what the problem was. i looked at all the discs and i could see little tiny scratches on the discs. (when you pull the disc out of the case, it scratches the dvd). i decided to jump to a random season and i put a random disc in. no joke. i got to the 4 episode and it started to skip again. don't by this and waste your money. your better off buying the actual dvd seasons separately. those cases are much better and no scratching involved. oh and did all of this within the first hour of me receiving the collection"
2,ehhh,"This one is cheaply made and the wire handle bends at every swat. The plastic portion is warped as well. But for the price, it's not worth returning. It does work, but for how long, I don't know."
4,good old fashioned swatter,"I like the wire handle, makes it easier to swat, was slightly disapointed as I thought that the bat of the swatter was going to be wire mesh rather than plastic, suits my needs though"
2,product ok amazon not so ok,purchased this product online to save 150.00 when the item arrived the battery was dead. no problem put it on charge and it will be ok. wrong battery would not take a charge. this item must have been sitting in a warehouse forever and no quality control was ever considered about looking into this. then after that problem was fixed the fuel filter on it kept clogging. there was setiment in the tank but the filter itself was just to fine for a fuel filter. after replacing the filter with a generic inline fuel filter and replacing the battery the genset itself worked good. take this revie for what its worth i will never order anything this big offline again i will pay the extra 150 to buy at a local dealer that way someone is close by to take care of the problems instead of having to do it myself.
1,I wish I had never bought this!,"I imported the Kipor IG6000 to Dominica, as we are off grid. Paying for Duty and freight in addition to the cost. First problem - dead battery. Kipor said ""charge it overnight"" We live on an island - had to pay $100US for a battery charger. It has been charging for 2 nights, and not even a spark.Next problem. The spec for the Kipor very clearly says 240v - which we need. When the generator arrives, there is a huge socket for 240v which no plug will fit. After countless emails to Kipor and the RV company we got it from. We were told that we bought an American Spec generator, so they can't help. So we then have to spend $150US on a transformer, and we have to pay for an electrician to wire it to the generator. So I would NOT recommend this product at all. I am disgusted with the way I have been brushed off, and how the spec for the generator is wrong. I have no idea whether it is a good generator - because I have so much to do before I can actually get it going!"
2,INVERTOR FAILURE,"PURCHASED KIPOR6000 USED LESS THAN TEN HOURS, WAS A BACKUP UNIT. WAS MANUFACTUERED IN 2006. WHEN I GOT IT LAST FALL EVERYTHING WORKED GREAT, PUT IT AWAY FOR THE WINTER. SPRING STARTUP-RED OVERLOAD LITE BLINKING=NO AC... HAD A HORRIBLE TIME GETTING HELP AND A DIAGNOSIS SO ON THE WEB I GO TO COMPILE INFO AND SERV/REPAIR MANUALS TO FIGURE THIS THING OUT. GOOD DIAGNOSIS MATERIALS. PROVED OUT THAT THE INVERTOR HAD FAILED SITTING OVER WINTER. A HUGE SOLID STATE $1,300 UNIT. WAS SHOCKED AT THE REPAIR COST AND THE FACT THAT NOW I FIND THAT THIS IS NOT UNCOMMON A FAILURE WITH THIS UNIT. POSSIBLY A COLD TEMP RELATED FAILURE?KIPOR WOULD DO NOTHING AS TO WARRANTY. [SECOND OWNWER THING].THE NEW INVERTOR LOOKS LIKE A REDESIGN, SURE HOPE THIS AN UPDATE TO FIX THE PROBLEM. IF I HAD TO DO IT OVER KNOWING THE INVERTOR PROBLEM, NO WAY I WOULD BY THIS CHINA SPECIAL. WAS A POOR INVESTMENT FOR SURE.!!!! ENDED UP BEING A THROW AWAY UNIT ....."
4,Nice ATL section.,with one or two other .net C++ books would be perfect.Very good explenation of unicode strings and how they relate to BSTR strings.
2,loved it at first but not anymore!,"Have had this exact model (purchased from a local store), for about a year now. All of the sudden it will not open any can that I try with it. I expected at least a few years from it. I will not buy this brand again."
1,Hamilton Beach Should Be Ashamed of this Product,"I purchased this electric can opener because my previous HB opener was really good and just died of old age. So I bought this one, not the same model as my other one and definitely not the same performance. It is horrible. A can opener is supposed to open cans and this one doesn't. It doesn't grasp the can, rotate it and open the can. The opener is probably about 6 months old. I think I'll stay away from HB can openers after this."
1,Piece of Junk,I have had this can opener for no more than 6 months and it has already stopped working.I rarely used it.The removable part is out of wack.It won't catch the can. It won't pierce the lid.It is a piece of junk.Do not buy this. Invest in a better can opener at a higher price or you'll wind up actually spending more purchasing another one when this flimsy one breaks....shortly after you buy it.
4,Works great,"If you need a basic can opener, this one is great. It also came with a rubber grip jar opener. The only problem I have with this can opener is that everytime I open a can, the blade gets dirty and so does the magnetic top. I had a can opener before that this did not happen to."
1,Mi Diva que te paso mi reina,"Mi Diva Lety, que nos tenias tan alejados de tu musica, ahora me decepcionas con esas cantadas tan baratas mi reina.Yo te voy apoyar en tu carrera, pero no con este disco, me duele el alma ver que nadie te asesoro, donde esta esa voz que te hizo LA DIVA DEL POP?LES PIDO QUE EN ESTE MOMENTO ESTEMOS MASUNIDOS QUE NUNCA UN PINC.. DISCO MAL HECHO, NO VA A ALTERAREL CARIÑO Y RESPETO QUE SIEMPRE LE HEMOS TENIDOA LUCIA.LOS DEMAS PUEDEN DECIR MISA,NOSOTROS SABEMOSQUIEN ES QUIEN AQUI, QUIENES SON FANS Y QUIENES NO., PERO RECONOCEMOS LOS ERRORES DE LA DIVA.Estoy triste por tan mal trabajo pero aun asi seguimos en contacto, y recuerda que TU CHEPA TE QUIERE.DONACHEPA SITE"
1,Despues de una larga espera,"Despues de una larga espera la Sr.Mendez nos presenta su nuevo material discografico, y desafortunadamente no llega al nivel de sus pasadas producciones cuando ella era una de las grandes artitas del espectaculo de los 80's, talvez es hora de reconocer que los tiempos han pasado y que ya no es la misma jovencita de antes."
2,No lo era lo que esperaba,"Apesar de considerarme el fan numero de Lucia, y aunque me duele admitirlo este cd realmente no es uno de sus mejores trabajos. Ojala regrese a la actuacion que nos hace mucha falta en la pantalla chica, Lucia, espero que el proximo trabajo sea mejor y mucha suerte en todo mi diva!! Te quiere siempre Alfredo."
5,Promises kept,"Asked by a friend to recommend an intoduction to the music of John Adams, I recommended this rather short disc. Not only because it has such accessible works by this major talent, but also because it allows the listener unfamiliar with the minimalist terrain enough samples to stimulate further investigation. Recorded in 1987 the San Francisco Symphony under Edo de Waart sounds a bit thin, but that too is a reason to start here. Much of Adams' music is played by this orchestra and since Michael Tilson Thomas' rise to the helm there has been an extraordinary sea change. After hearing this recording, play the 1997 recording by the same orchestra (led by Adams) performing the ""Harmonium"" and ""The Klinghoffer Choruses"" and I think you'll note the difference, sonically and stylistically.. And while you're comparing you will have grown into the more major later works of Adams!"
5,Musical wallpaper? I think not!,"This CD was my first introduction to John Adams' music, and it's been afrequently played item ever since! The opening track ""The Chairman Dances"" glides along smoothly like a foxtrot, ""Christian Zeal andActivity"" flows serenely, ""Tromba Lontana"" makes excellent use ofspatial effects, ""Short Ride in a Fast Machine"" proves that Adamscan use bellicosity and brutality just as effectively as Sibelius orWagner, and ""Common Tones in Simple Time"" is quite a fitting way toclose things out. Edo de Waart and the SFSO keep things moving along,showing their well-known sympathy for music such as this. All in all,this puts the lie to the notion that minimalist composers transportpeople to snoozeville."
4,A Good Introduction to John Adams,"When someone asks me to give him or her a CD as an introduction to John Adams, I give this because it features several shorter works, a couple of which are very accessible. ""The Chairman Dances"" is a catchy foxtrot taken from a tune Adams used in his very popular opera ""Nixon in China."" ""Short Ride in a Fast Machine"" is an adrenaline-pumping, spirit-lifting fanfare on level with works like Shostakovich's ""Festive"" Overture. ""Common Tones in Simple Time"" is a pastorale suitable for calmer listening, and the rewards it offers are more subtle. ""Christian Zeal and Activity"" makes interesting use of the recorded voice of a preacher, although I tend to think that the work as a whole is a little too simplistic."
3,?,"I think I just don't get John Adams. I like other minimalistic composers a lot. But this cd I only listened to a few times before knowint it wasn't for me. The title piece, The Chairman Dances (Foxtrot for Orchestra), is beautiful, repeating through a tapestry & changing minutely & deliberately with introduction or subtraction of musical lines (which consist of a couple notes & a pulsing rhythm) & brilliant manipulation. It's an exciting piece. But then. The rest of the cd just kind of plops for me. One of the pieces features a very long evangelical rant. Why did John Adams have to put that there?"
2,Downhill from here,Adams is perhaps the most overrated composer of our day. Short Ride in a Fast Machine would be okay as background to a tv commercial...Common Tones is simply forgettable (and way too long). New age music for the concert hall. 'Early' digital recording. You will find yourself jumping up and down to adjust the volume; helps to have a remote.
4,chord chemistry,"it,s a great intro to chord building I purchased this back in 1974 and lost itso when I saw it on line I had to pick it up"
4,guitar books,I give this book a 4 star rating and I take away the one star because I have difficulty reading the diagrams.
3,Good but in need of editing,"This book is a treasure trove of chord theory (and application). As such it should rate 5 stars. However, the book hasn't been edited since it's publication in 1971!That means hand-drawn chord diagrams, funky arrows, and hand-written notes (that occasionally may be impossible to read!).At the price charged, the publisher should have taken the time (and expense) to update the work with computer-drawn diagrams and better lay-out.The content is first class, but the poor lay-out lets it down.It's a 1971 book, where only the price have been brought up to date."
4,Not bad,"Thearon Willis's approach is pretty straight forward, and that's what I like. In short this book gets a solid positive review and has minor peeves.In short this is a great intro to SQL server 7. Good use of explaining triggers, and stored procedures. Most important the examples are REAL WORLD BUSINESS examples that you can use. So many other books get you to do things that are totaly useless.While I wouldn't design and interface like he did, or make the tables, as such, and I did find his stored procedures a bit overly lengthy, it's still a great book to get started on and has a lot of usefull stuff. Knowing VB helps but not neccesary and is of course not concentrated on either..solid 4, Another good Wrox book."
4,Not for the New bees,This is an excellent book if and only if you already have experience in Vb and SQL. Definitely not for beginners. Lots of very good learning examples easy to read and understand. Good tool for getting you up to speed quickly.
5,Have you ever enjoyed reading a technical book?,"This is absolutely the best technical book I have read. The book takes an intermediate Visual Basic programmer with no knowledge of database programming and provides the knowledge in a clear and easy to follow format.The examples on working with SQL Server Enterprise Manager, Query Analyzer, and how to call Stored Procedures and inline SQL statements are excellent.I wish I could give the book six stars."
3,"Fairly comprehensive though ""beginning"" title is appropriate","This isn't a bad book. If you're a beginner who has a decent aptitude for software development, you will probably like this book. Experienced developers may find him long-winded at time and get tired of his explaining Enterprise Manager menus and stuff like that. Nevertheless, there is certainly valuable information for non-beginners. You may want to purchse the ""professional"" book instead if you're experienced with database design, sql server, and vb. If you think this book is too difficult for a beginner then sorry to say, but you may want to consider a different field."
2,Not on Par for subject,Too much filler and not enough how and why. There are many books out there on this subject and this one did not measure up. I would suggest moving straight to Vieira's book (pro sql 7) for anyone with fundamental understanding of the subject.
1,Beginning visual basic sql server 7.0 by thearon willis -,"This book alleges that it is for visual basic beginners. Onpage 5 it tells you that this is for experienced visual basic developers. His claim is that he is an experienced database guru. But, by page 23 after he completely fouls up a relatively simple employee name and address file into 7 different tables it is apparent that Thearon should spend more time learning his craft than trying to pass himself off (thru Amazon and Wrox) as an expert."
5,A Special Holiday Romance,"Kristin Hardy delivers a heartfelt story in Under The Mistletoe.Gabe Trask loves his job as the manager of The Hotel Mt. Jefferson. He is entranced by Hadley Stone. He doesn't realize at first that Hadley isn't a guest, she is part of the new owners cost cutting management.

Kristin Hardy writes a story that will stay with you long after you have finished the book. Looking forward the next book in this series."
5,furnace filter,I ordered this 20x25x5 furnace filter for less than a third the cost of the same quality filter from the local dealer. It's a quality product and am pleased.
4,Functions well,Nice filter for the price. They arrived quickly and were packaged apropriately without dents or damage. I would purchase these filters again.
3,Good condition but a little large,The filters arrived quickly and in good condition. One small problem I had is that there are about 1/4 of an inch bigger then the original filters I was using. I was able to force them into the container with a little bit of manuvering. If you space is ver tight be sure these will fit.
1,The listed dimensions on the site were inaccurate and I had to return the merchandise and buy it elsewhere.,"For some reason they quote it at ""rounded"" dimensions when the actual device it are quite specific. This enabled me to order the wrong device and have to pay for its return."
5,It's great to finally hear talent and womens experiances.,It's great to hear that someone appreciates a womens experiances and translates it to music.
3,Flava flav,Another one of Mezco great products. A great addition to your Public Enemy collection. A must have for all fans. Buy it
5,LOVE!!!,"LOVE this album, can't get enough of all Toni's hits!!! Perfect compilation of all of my favorite Toni Braxton songs."
5,DREAM COME TRUE,"Face the fact that Toni's best album ever is her first--a classic--and the number of songs on this selection, outnumbering all the others, is proof of that. I never bought her other CDs as I found them too monotonous. But I always hoped for a good compilation of her ""best"". Well, my dream has finally come true! It's a beaut! But make sure you get the 2CD limited-edition (18 on one CD; 6 remixes on the second)--it's worth the wait and extra pennies, believe me! I'm expecting more of the same in the future, Toni."
4,"Collection of Great Singles, But Not Ultimate Collection","Believe or not she's been around for a decade and has an incredible run of songs that made it into high rotation play at many Urban, Pop, and Adult radio stations worldwide. This is an ultimate collection of Toni Braxton's most popular released singles, plus 2 new songs, and a re-mix dance club version of ""Un-break My Heart"".It's great to have them all on 1 CD, but I would love to have an ultimate collection that showcases her vocal talent on many songs that weren't released as singles. It's a good addition to the CD collection if you're a radio fan, but a true fan of Toni's work knows the collection is missing several songs...* In the Late of Night/Toni's Secret (Secrets, 1996)* Spanish Guitar and I'm Still Breathing (The Heat, 2000)* Rock Me, Roll Me and Selfish (More than a Woman, 2002)"
3,SOMETHING NEW FOR ME,TONI BRAXTON VERY NEW TO ME. BROUGHT THIS CD BECAUSEOF RATING IS VERY GOOD. TONI HAS A GOOD VOICE BUT HERSTYLE OF SONG IS NOT THE KIND I USUALLY LISTEN.
5,Nice album,"Well this is a good album, worth your money. I liked Toni since 1996 'secret'. Very nice voice.:-) My only gripe is I couldn't back up this CD. :-("

5,ITS KOKANE NOT LEMON-HEAD!,"It is true that Kokane is known mostly for singing hooks, but what people need to understand is that Kokane started out as an MC and his unique/original/fly style should not be ignored by anyone!It is true that Kokane's funky style is something different that the 99,9% ""let me say all the same stuff everyone else is saying""-style rappers, but I can honestly say that Kokane is my favourite rapper by far!""Do You Know Jesus"" is a track from Jerry Long (/Kokane's) still unreleased ""Ghetto Gospel"" record, and if this dosent knock your socks off nothing will. Trust me.All in all this record is, once again, a showcase of Kokane's fly unique style that no one in the world could copy if their lifes depended on it..."
5,West Coastin',If you want to get your groove on this is it. West Coast G- Funk!!!! Unlike most albums out there this one is great the whole way through. It's kinda like a story. Love it!!!
5,Just the right devise on the right place !,"Shooters Ridge Extended Bi-Pod (14.5 - 29.25-Inch)No faults, all as described and fit like a glove!A very good and stable product for my ""Savage Axis""!"
2,Poor Kindle formatting,The text formatting for the Kindle version is so poor as to render the book unreadable. I strongly recommend that you Sample this one before you buy.
1,Disappointed,Having read another of Bullinger's books (on the gospel in the stars) I expected his book on Job to be commentary and scientific explanation of things mentioned in Job. This book was practically a reprint of Job out of the Bible with very little commentary. I was very disappointed when it arrived.
