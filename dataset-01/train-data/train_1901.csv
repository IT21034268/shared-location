2,What's with all these cheesey effects?,"I don't know what they were thinking when they decided how they wanted this video to come out. If it were filmed normally without these awful, annoying effects, this video would get 5 stars from me. The songs are good, the sound is good, the picture [stinks]. It really makes it hard to watch. After years of waiting for this video to come out, I was expecting something a lot better. I recommend the House Of Yes video instead."
3,I'm confused,"I'm not sure if I should buy this DVD because the reviews below -- despite all the four and five stars -- are basically saying ""Buy this for the music, not the video."" Since I own this same music on CD, I'm not sure if I should buy this just for the video.If you buy a music DVD, you should judge it on the video as well as the audio; it's a package deal. If you think the video and graphics are not worth it, then you should just buy the CD or give the DVD the rating it deserves.What I'm confused about is why everyone is giving this DVD five stars while saying that the video portion is less than great. That makes no sense. Are all of you such blind Yes fans that you can't judge a product of theirs for its true worth?"
5,Best Yet,"This is the best Yes video to date. I can't believe these other reviews. I have seen Yessongs, Live in Philly and House of Yes. The first two are unwatchable due to the terrible soundtracks. House of Yes is good but obviously the playlist doesn't compare with Keys. As for the added graphics, I did not find them to be a distraction and in some cases I thought they were pretty damn cool. They did have a slightly dated quality but I found it appropriate for a concert of all 70's music. I can't believe I almost didn't get this due to some of the other reviews."
5,Don't Listen To The Naysayers,"I am also glad that I did not listen to the reviewers that have given this DVD low marks. I don't think they ""got the concept"". This was not a live show in the true sense of the word and the videos were added to enhance the music as it is a DVD. Just go with the flow. If you don't like it shut your TV off and just listen to the music. The sound quality is the best from Yes that you will hear (so far) and in a few spots the bass is just spectacular. The walls and the ceiling in my sound room were shaking. Truly amazing. If you like Yes and you have a system capable of producing music properly, this is a ""no brainer"". Get it. In fact get it with the House of Yes DVD. The band is in a different mood during that one and the 2 DVD's complement each other perfectly..."
3,Endless Music-Too Many Effects,"The music of Yes as we all know is endless. It has spanned the years bringing music of the future to the times of today. This DVD is proof of just how GREAT their music is. However, if this DVD had focused on the band the music and the lighting of the stage, it would have been perfect. Someone, must have been just introduced to the special effects buttons. There are so many effects in this DVD that you are almost yelling at your television to just show the band playing. There are water effects(LOTS) and spinning effects. Fade in and out effects. Sparkle effects slow motion effects. WAY TOO MANY!! Another interesting thing is it appears that there must be a group of singers off stage helping the band. In the Revealing Science of God, it is evident that this is going on. I am and always will be a Yes fan. I will still watch this DVD. I wish it had been filmed more like The House of Yes show, where you can focus on each band member."
4,the music makes up for the vedio,"i think this dvd is a must for any yes fan. the classic line up along with a great set of music. as stated the 5.1 is great (could have a little more bottom end) the vedio, its a shame. yes is a band that should be watched to appricate all there talent and with all the roger dean art work takes away from the performance, they cut away from key solos and fingure work to show tasteless art work. the biggest example of this is in the revealing science of god the audio was off, some of the vedio was backwards and there singing going from people that arn't there??? but over all this dvd is a must,it was a great show. i gave it 4 star only because of the art work"
3,'great',"Yes does a great job with a great setlist. As another reviewer stated an obsercation about other singers/musicians offstage...I disagree. I believe that there was some 'post-production' work with the band to tighten up vocals and botched notes. There are two schools of thought on this, but whatever the case, YES are playing and playing well. That's the the true statement. Overall, a great performance."
1,Can't Watch It!,"This DVD is simply one of the worst concert productions I have ever had the misfortune to see and pay for.And yes, I LOVE YES folks, that's why I bought it!The effects are unwatchable and when you finally realize it's all out of sync and put haphazardly together from at least two different performances...even edits from different performances during the same shot of a rippin solo...(see Steve Howe, steel slide, And You And I)...Well, need I say more?Stay away from this one folks, even the lowly ""Live In Philly"" is better than this, and many other Yes DVD's are much better!"
1,symphinic rock or soap opera?,"The thing about this video is that it doesn't look, neither sound like a live concert...you don't feel the audience. The images makes the thinks of the soap opera that my mother like so much."
1,Don't waste your money or time on this one.,"I love Yes but this product is horrible. All of the bad reviews are true, but the overuse/misuse of graphic effects is in no way my biggest complaint. The main problem is that the video isn't properly syncronized to the audio. It's downright painful watching Steve Howe play when the audio is just a hair off or at times completely wrong. Bottom line is that I'll probably never watch this one again. If anyone knows how to contact the producer of this schlock please let me know as I'd love to tell them how I feel. Boycott this one folks. We deserve much better."
2,Just listen. Not for watching.,"Reasons to get this DVD:1. You want to see footage of people skiing during ""Going for the One"".2. You want to watch musicians in stylin' ""step-action-cam"" during some of the solos, so that you can see their facial expressions, and see their hands touching the instruments, but be protected from having to really watch how they play.3. You like the idea of some of the lyrics fading in for you to read as they are sung, so that you really pay attention to what those Yes lyrics are like.4. You want to hear this excellent live set, and really don't want to pay for the studio tracks that are on the KtA CDs."
1,Trash,This book is based almost entirely on accumulating second hand rumors and speculation from other sources and amassing them into what loosely constitutes 'A Book.' The author's only original section comes when he details coming face to face with Mark Wahlberg at a gym. Does he bother to speak to Mark? No? Why? Because the author is spineless. This book is spineless. Definitely bottom of the pile as far as unauthorized biographies go. A disappointment.
3,"Nice music, but where are the DVDs?","This soundtrack CD has some great big-band music, and nice samples of Ann Miller's dancing. Now, if Sony Pictures/Columbia would make these movies available on DVD!"
1,"The Beatles '64 Tour T-Shirt returned, requesting an exchange and never receiving it, fiasco.","I returned this item because it didn't fit right and requested an exchange. I never received the exchange item I ordered, so, I called customer service and re-ordered what I wanted ( the exchange), so, I basically was charged twice for the same item. Consequently, I am not happy with this company."
4,excellent overview for my multicultural counseling class,"I had to use this textbook for my multicultural counseling class. It seems a little old (about 10 years old) but the information is still very insightful and gives a great overview of cultures. Maybe if it was longer it wouldn't lump groups such as Pacific Asian Islanders and Asian cultures together or Latino as one culture. Overall, it gives a great overview and how to work with them."
4,Bond theme,"So many great Bond themes have been created over the years, my own favourites include Shirley Bassey's 3 and Gladys Knight, was unsure of this at first, but it has really grown on me and I actually did buy it. It certainly suits such a new and probably best Bond ever...."
1,DONT BE FOOLED!,"I am a HUUUUUUUUGE Bond fan since I was 5 years old and LOVE all the movies. When I first heard the ""rock"" version of this song a month before the movie came out it caught me off guard, but eventually grew on me to the point where I listened to it on my ipod over 700 times!!! (itunes counter) So anyway, then other versions of the song came out. The music videos version is the POP version which in my opinion is better than the ROCK version. Then when I saw Casino Royale during the title sequence, it was another version, the FILM version which was better than any other previously released version. Then a few weeks after it was announced that the single would be released. On the cover it says ""AS FEATURED IN THE MOTION PICTURE CASINO ROYALE"" but DONT BE FOOLED!!! IT'S THE SAME OL ROCK VERSION WE ALL HAD A MONTH BEFORE THE FILM WAS RELEASED! TOTAL SCAM!"
2,Good Music-Disappointing CD!!!,"Like others while I was looking forward to hearing more music I was ticked that there are only 2 songs on the CD!!! Amazon should make more clear. Reasonable people would expect more than 2 Songs on a CD. Regards, Ripped Off."
2,One of the Weaker Bond Themes,"I'm not sure why they thought this would rank among the best of the Bond themes when the producers accepted it. Yes, Casino Royale is a different kind of Bond film; edgier, grittier and in some ways, even better, but this music adds nothing to the mix. It seems gray, even faceless, with none of the 'setting introduction' or character usually invoked by an opening theme. The other issue is how the artist did not want it included on the movie soundtrack, so it would have to be bought separately. Another indication that it may not belong in the Bond library?"
3,Rousseau Downdrafter,"I have a 10"" compund sliding miter saw bolted to a table top. I attached the downdrafter to the back of the table. Installation was easy -- make sure you put the miter saw rails as deep as you can into the downdrafter. It has a 4"" connector at the base to attach to a vacuum system. I tried it both with a portable vacuum and with my main Delta vacuum. The downdrafter did not work very well with the portable vacuum. With the Delta, the downdrafter helps to contain about 60% of the dust. It slides on the rails and the head swivels to enable horizontal movement of the miter saw for angle and bevel cuts. I'm happy with improving dust collection, but don't expect this hood to capture all the dust."
5,"Freaking Sweet, the best comp ever","I'm hardly joking, this is such a good compilation you'll (s)cream anyways, this is the sh*t my friends, or so to speak the 'ish. Of course nobody has really listened to this so nobody is going to gimmie a no so I can make this review as bad as I can... anyways this is a beetchin' compilation the little rock nine kill it, if anyone out there in interweb land know where I can pick up additional recordings by this fine group tell me. Oh yeah I got it at some show in Fort Wayne a few years back when I was scene. Nice!"
4,At last! Michigan underground documented to CD.,"This cd cannot handle the shear power of the Michigan ska and punk scene. So raw, so high-energy, so emotional and so turbulent. This CD is the only evidence that many of these scene-shattering bands even existed. And big Detroit names like Aks Mama, Beauty School Dropouts and Old Spice thrown in for fun"
3,A summer's read on a winter's evening.,"This is a fascinating and absorbing novel. Although it doesn't have the natural realism of ""THE Autobiography of Jesus and the Missing Years"" it is movingly poetic. It is refreshing to find Jesus being presented in such an accessible manner. I had hoped for a more challenging presentation but I was more than compensated by the skill of the writing. If you find your faith at times flagging, this may just be the breath of fresh air you've been hoping for."
2,"Debunking the classical Jesus, again","The most interesting part of this book was the exchange between Jesus and Pilate. The rest seemed to be an obvious attempt to discredit the canonical gospel accounts of Jesus' life and death. Not half as interesting as either Mailer's ""The Gospel according to the Son"" or even Kazantkakis ""The Last Temptation of Christ."" This book was a disappointment, especially if you have followed the Historical Jesus literature of the past few years."
2,Gold will rub off easily! Might as well buy the all silver version.,"After only three months of very careful meticulous wear, the gold accents have worn off! I am so disappointed since I loved the two tones together. Now it looks just like the all silver version of the watch. My old Bulova watch didn't have this problem."
5,great seller,Excellent excellent seller - fabulous watch - great bargain - fast delivery - A+ buying experience
5,You really can serve it for company,"The box says, you don't have to admit that it comes from a box because it is so tasty. I had guests over and they raved about it. I'm just glad that all Annie's pasta are easy to make and taste great. Haven't had a version that I didn't like."
1,Terrible!,"This pasta was absolutely terrible. I bought two boxes and made one the other day. The smell was interesting, but the taste was awful. It literally made me want to throw up - and I usually love Annie's products. I'm wishing I hadn't bought two boxes because the second box is going to go in the donation pile for the food bank."
3,Mediocre,"This is OK. I had hoped for broccoli but instead I got broccoli flavoring. All it does is give the sauce an off taste; I doubt there's much increase in nutrition. I found it on sale for 79c, not sure I'd go over $1. Not Annie's best creation!"
2,Too expensive,"This product is too expensive on amazon. At our local Hannifords market we can get 6 boxes separately cheaper than Amazon.Hannifords sells this product for 2.37 each, times 6 and that's $14.22 almost $2.00 cheaper. Why spend the extra $2.00, plus shipping with amazon?"
5,Excellent CD,this CD is the best - I picked up the cassette tapes in London last year and absolutly loved it -now i'm getting the CD's. Excellent mix of american and european artists. Must have for any music fan! Worth the Money :)
5,Just Perfect,This is one of the most fascinating songs ever play by Maiden!the golden years are here. Please buy the new CD and Support this band. The more we support it the more chances we will have to have another CD in 2009!
1,This Was Bad,Item was never received despite the several excuses and promises. A refund was issued by Amazon
3,not the best,I like the ring but it is not the best. the stone was a pretty blue but not aquamarine. looked more like a very dull blue topaz. the ring was not a true size five ring. it came at a 5 1/2. and please don't try to wear this ring everyday. keep in box and wear at special occassions. i wore it for three days straight and that third day the prongs holding the gemstone in place were all bent up. pretty ring though.
4,Grad's ring,I got this ring for my sister-in-law when she graduated from high school. Up on receiving it in the mail it looks just like the picture! That made me happy! She loves the ring and never takes it off! As far as I know it's still holding up and looking great!
2,Sent it back,"I received this ring, along with two others, from Gem Avenue today. I had ordered from Gem Avenue previously and was very happy with the quality of that ring for the price I paid. Unfortunately, the quality of this one didn't match up.The aquamarine stone had no sparkle or shine to it. Even though it was an inexpensive ring, I expected more from Gem Avenue and in fact, I paid less for one of the other rings in today's shipment and it's much nicer.This one went back."
3,Alright Ring for good price!!!,"This is a great ring but a poor price. Do not be fooled by the photo. When I received the ring I was a little surprised by the poor craftsmanship. The center stone was set secure, but some of the side stones were slightly out of line with the others. Also the design in the side of the ring was not consistent. Overall I would give this ring for the price a 3 because as sad as it is I have seen better quality rings at Wal-mart for less. Personally, had I seen the ring in a store, I wouldn't have paid more than ten dollars for it. Just so you know in defence of the ring. Still today 14 months after buying it, no stones have fallen out, and it has yet to be cleaned and shines like crazy."
3,Not a very good guide...............,"My boyfriend and I recently went to San Diego equipped with just this one guide book and it wasn¡t enough. We had to use the maps provided by our hotel to figure out how to get to the places that we wanted to go.However, I felt that the restaurant recommendations were pretty good. Whenever I went to a different location, I just followed their recommendations for food and had very pleasant meals without wasting too much time deciding on where to eat.I definitely will not recommend this guidebook to people who have never traveled in California before, because there just isn¡t enough information on freeways and directions. I agree with the reviewer below that it¡s best to use this guide book with another more in depth one. But if you¡ve been to San Diego before and want to visit the place again, then this guide is probably enough for you to get to the good food places and perhaps spark your interest in visiting some other attractions as well."
5,The one we recommend.,"To the thousands of our readers, local and world-wide who ask us to recommend one book about San Diego travel....this is the one."
5,"Great, Wonderful, Fun","I love this book. The poems are great and I can find the poems that Anne says in the movie, ""Anne of green Gables"" and ""Anne of Avonlee"" I love the poems. I like These are the Times That try Mens Soals."
5,A time-honored classic.,"A copy of this book was given to me at the tender age of six. From that point on, it became my favorite book. Today, I am 30, and I still cherish my old dog-eared copy. Rudyard Kipling's ""If"" and Eugene O'Neils's ""The Duel"" are just a few of the delights waiting for you.Unfortunately, this volume only represents European and Americans-of-the-""White""-Persuasion authors. For a more well-rounded collection of the world's poetry, you will have to find other books to supplement this one.Highly recommended. :)"
3,"Good for some, awful for many.","I don't know. I suppose that I am supposed to agree that these are important poems, but I feel like they're just famous. Naturally, there'll be some good ones and some bad ones. Chances are, you won't be buying this for yourself, but rather for a class. The annoying thing about this is that this is a horrible way to get students interested in poetry."
5,poems,Wonderful little book. I owned an earlier copy and misplaced it. I was happy to find another copy.
5,Eclectic,"Diverse selections include non-poetry.Birth and death dates for poets is great for numerology enthusiasts .Well made book,good pictures of the writers."
4,"a classic, but...","i have to say that i enjoy reading poems, but then too much of old classics that in the end i gave up and gave it to my father in law ;))). maybe some sort of generation gap here (plus cultural gap! as i m an asian), well, i will then try some more modern stuffs... ;))). anyway whoever love old classics should have this, and to grace a library, this is also a must... Tanadi Santoso, 12/97"
3,Good addition but,"This is a good addition to any poetry lovers collect. I love the choice of poems also and the production value is very good. But I'd also add the CD: ""Poetry Classics To Funky Hits"" to complement this product."
5,A treat for yourself or a special friend!,"I first became acquainted with this slim volume in seventh grade when I asked my teacher where she found the poetry that we were to memorize. That was in 1942 and it was an ""old"" collection then. I borrowed my teacher's book and was introduced to a whole world of philosophy in an art form. I soon acquired my own copy and it has never been far from my reach. I can always find something new and rewarding when I open this volume. Times change; needs change; viewpoints change; yet the selections presented seem forever applicable to our society. There is always a place for beauty and serenity and this volume is the place I most frequently find it. This collection is number one on my list of what to give someone special. I am ordering it now for my granddaughter's first grade teacher."
1,Very little information,"I don't know what the people have seen in this book. It's extremly expensive, is small, and it hasn't the in-depth information I'd expect for a ccie written test. It only outlines information, nothing more. For example: for FIFOs, WFQ, Queuing, QoS and traffic shaping there are.. 13 pages!! OSPF is treated in ¡4 pages!I haven't taken ccie written yet, but I expect it to be a difficult test, and I think this book is going to be of no use."
4,"Awesome book, but know what you're buying","i just wanted to say what an awesome book this is, everything is laid out very well, and it's the only cisco-related book so far where i havent fallen asleep after an hour. it actually sounds like a human wrote it (it gives nice little examples, and isn't all dry ""cisco press"" lecturing).this book won't have every single configuration command in existence, because it is a ""study guide"", but does very well in outlining everything and getting your mindset in the right place for the exam.nitpicking:-atm section seemed to be a bit sparse to me.-lots of typos, not technical ones, but mainly grammatical or spelling. not worrisome, but still irkful<--is that a word?i'd like to give it 5 stars, but im reserving that for their next edition... :P"
2,Not enough depth + too expensive,"I don't understand all the positive reviews. This book is overrated. It has ~250 pages of very generic information. Do not expect to find any details in this book. It is also useless as a reference. Any Cisco press book has much more useful info than this ""study guide"". I have not even tried their tests yet, because, get this, you have to register with the NLI to get a serial number first. and then you can install it on one computer only. So if you use two computers (home and office) to study, then you're [in trouble]... The only reason I gave it two stars is because I still hope that the tests will live up to the expectations."
4,a very good album,"I love the atmosphere of this album. The use of keyboards (sometimes harpsischord, sometimes organ, sometimes what sounds like an electronically altered piano) to flesh out the guitar and bass harmonies, combined with not-overdone reverb effects, give the Doors a beautiful, full sound that epitomizes (for me, at least) the word ""psychedelic."" Besides that, the songs are quite good. Except for the boring 11-minute finale (yes, heresy, I know), there really isn't a bad track here. ""People Are Strange"" and ""You're Lost Little Girl"" are especially powerful."
5,Strange Days is not so strange after all,"Strange Days has some really great music. I always thought the introductory album by the Doors was there best music, but for their early period, well before L.A. Woman, Strange Days may be their best music in an early album that they ever did. I won't go on to list the songs on the album, but just say if you really like the Doors as I do, this is one album you don't want to miss. I mean it. It really has some great music in it."
5,Listen To The Music,"When you're in a spin, a permanent frown. Down is up and up is down. Your pinky is your thumb or maybe your toe. The product of a drug which many people know? This is my one of my favorite albums, from one of my favorite bands. It is easy listening. It's Jim Morrison's creepy lullaby to the world and we should thank him. This vinyl is heavy (literally), clean sounding, free from many pops and ticks with a depth unmatched by digital media. This is an album to own, to cherish. There is not one dud on this. Not one. Get this!P.S. If the title got that Doobie Brothers song stuck in your head, I apologize fiercely."
4,doors ride again,"another great album by the doors. great arrangements of instruments, perfectly in sync. great vocals and lyrics, but did jim really say ""baby gonna drown tonite"" or ""baby don't drown tonite"" on moonlight drive? either way it's a great song and album."
4,great cd,"next to the doors' self titled album, this one is probally the best. Jim Morrison is truly ""an american poet"" and some of his best work is on this cd. my favorite, lyric-wise, is probally 'cant see your face in my mind'. i definetly recommend this cd."
1,no ha llegado,"dear friend, would like to know what happened to this product that has not yet arrived. being who has already spent more than a reasonable time.waiting for an early replyAlexander"
1,Not happy,I was so excited to get my Srange Days by the Doors cd in the mail. I ripped it open and placed the cd in the cd player and realized that while the case said Srange Days the cd was The Soft Parade. I did address this issue however did not get a response back.
5,"Fight on, Harvey!","With caustic wit and a gravelly voice that would make Tallulah jealous, Harvey Fierstein sings and talks through personal and public issues. He is the man your parents warned you about, and the one your friends should hear. In addition to original songs which he delivers with feelings of love and anger, Harvey dishes up an honest version of the old ""Frankie and Johnnie"", which I had only heard before in a VERY edited fashion. This album is not for the shy, faint-of-heart, or rabid conservative. Harvey's message is simple: gay people are human beings, deserving of life, liberty and the pursuit of a fabulous life, we're tired of oppression, and we're not going to take it any more. Should be part of your collection!"
5,Sorry to see this is Out-of-Print,"This is possibly the funniest CD released in the 1990s. It shows Harvey at his peak as a performer and personality. His recreation of the wig scene from ""Valley of the Dolls"" is worth the cost of the disc alone. Search for this one, it's worth it!"
4,Scourge of the cold northern wastes...,"Truly what it says it is, Thyrfing serves up an incredible slab of metal that is sure to invoke images of viking raids to the mind of any listener. Driving guitars and drums, with a dashing of relatively simplistic yet none the less effective synth work. Though the music is rather basic in it's theory, the execution of it definitly stands out, making this a great choice to any fan of brutal heavy metal."
2,reference book,"The book consists of questions and answers. They are divided into chapters by topic. This format makes this a reference book, but not one which you want to read cover to cover. If you are hungry for all 101 answers, you are better off with another book on the subject.But it sits on my shelf for use as a reference."
5,An splendid tool for the scholar who is already familiar with the history of the Jews of Poland,"This book is really good if you are familiar with the subject, and it represents a more dynamic view on old debates."
1,Quit working after 6 weeks,"I bought this reconditioned unit on April 6th and it's quit working on May 14th. I'll see if I can send it to be repaired again. Judging by the complaints of people buying the new unit, I'm glad I didn't spend too much money."
2,Doesn't Work Well,"I received the unit around 2 weeks ago. I was on vacation for 1 week and when I came back the interior dind't feel all that cool. I placed a thermometer (cooking thermometer) inside 2 days ago. The interior temparature (afte 24 hours was 65), temperature of unit read 56 degrees. I turned it down as low as it will go. The LED's say 50 but the interior temparature is 61 degrees, 24 hours later.I am not satisfied. I will let it run another 2 days and if it doesn't chill to the desired temparature, I will return it."
1,Absolute garbage with a serious design flaw,"DO NOT BUY. We trusted our best wine to this cooler, but at some point over the last several months, it stopped cooling. Worse than that, it actually HEATED UP. When we discovered that it was heating rather than cooling the temperature in the cooler was 95 degrees F and most of the wine had breached their corks. Why would they not have a simple shut off at any point if the interior exceeds 70 degrees. They should assume there has been a catasttophic failure and just shut down. It's very sad... I notified Cuisinart, to which they replied that the warranty excludes incidental damages. Stay away. Danger. Do not buy. Avoid Cuisinart and Conair products as they appear to have a long history of customer dissatisfaction. They are a private company and are not under as much scrutiny as a public company would be."
4,Great high-level adventure from Ed Greenwood,"Here's a forgotten Ed Greenwood classic! The great mage, Aglahund the Mighty, lies buried atop Galzar's Crag. His apprentice Ulthorn, one of his greatest proteges, was recently found dead next to the tomb - in a doorway that never existed before! Now, it's up to the heroes (levels 15-20) to ascend the Endless Stair and discover the dread secret none have ever lived to tell... recommended and fun."
2,not the way to go,"Tried these on my dust collection system and was very disappointed. I would not recommend them, when you loosen them the fall apart, the washer falls out and I had to rebuild them. I would not recommend these to anyone."
5,Without this book I think I would have given up !!!,I think that this book was one of the most useful books I have ever read. It is written so that you know exactly what is being relayed to you..I have just finished writting my first book and I was so lost. I did not know what direction to turn as far as getting it published. Everything was explained in such a manner that you did not have to second guess what to do next.. Thank you Debby Mayer for writting such a fine book...
1,Lots of fluff that you can figure out with common sense.,"Lots of talk about what annoys agents. If you are smart enough to not call your prospective agent 5 times a day, and mentally healthy enough not to blow up at the slightest criticism, then you know the contents of this book. You are better off buying ""2001 Guide to Literary Agents"" and ""2002-2003 Writer's Guide to Book Editors, Publishers, and Literary Agents."" If you buy those two books, you'll get as much distilled info about lit agents as you need WHILE AT THE SAME TIME getting the contact information you need."
3,Blends elements of world from mbira to guitar & digeridoo!,"Themba 'Max' Mutambo, Chris Bowden and others are Barunga, and THE MESSENGERS is their achievement: a modern African vocal-based cd blending elements of world music from mbira and guitar to piano and even digeridoo: in a nutshell, London meets South Africa.An innovative, eclectic sound which simply defies standardization or niche marketing."
4,The Doors' Third Album,"Though not on the same level as the first two albums, ""Waiting for the Sun"" (1968) remains solid Doors all the way. Along with the chart-topping ""Hello, I Love You"" are essential tracks such as ""Not to Touch the Earth,"" ""Summer's Almost Gone,"" ""Yes, the River Knows"" and the explosive ""Five to One."" More relaxed in tone, but no dead spots - certainly superior to ""The Soft Parade."" The title track would make its belated debut on ""Morrison Hotel."""
5,Loved this. Great job Faye,"This was indeed a great show to watch. I was at first a bit worried how this might turn out. But as ALWAYS Faye done a great job. The casting was impeccable and the story behind it. Each High Priced Call Girl had great careers they were working towards. Faye being the ringleader of all of them.. Faye showed great strength and compassion In The scenes. Over all I loved it, some parts were a bit slow but in general I think it's terrific."
5,Best pharm book,"This book is way better than Lippincott (which has prettier pictures, but isn't very useful when you need details-- don't be fooled)! I found the information organized, thorough (without being exhaustive), and well-written. Great for reference during 1st and 2nd years of med school; I hate pharm, but this book made it tolerable. For boards prep, I would recommend using it along with the Lange pharm flashcards."
5,Fabulous Pharm Review,"Short, concise discussion on each category (not specific drugs) with notes on drugs that have interesting or significant deviation from category. Explanations are short and sometimes thin, but if you do the practice questions you realize a lot of the teaching info in book comes from the questions. Highly recommended review book."
1,Carpenter should be ashamed. . .,"Robert, Lord Runcie died last night after a long battle with cancer. Sadly, though, he lived long enough to see this book published.Humphrey Carpenter, the son of an Anglican bishop, and the author of several well-received books on JRR Tolkien and the Inklings, did not live up to his previous standards in this volume, and did, in the opinion of this reviewer, seriously strain the bounds of journalistic ethics, confidentiality, and certainly good taste.This book needs to be set in strong contrast with scholarly works about the life and ministry of Lord Runcie, and should not be considered an accurate or clear picture of the late archbishop.For a better picture of Lord Runcie, read Adrian Hastings biography, and the archbishop's own sermons."
4,Seen Better,"There are a lot better anti-Bush stickers out there; the referent for this one just won't be clear to a lot of people.But, if you find the sticker disgusting, consider who its about.A dangerous and disgusting leader in the eyes of many. Look for the ""Defoliate Bush"" sticker instead."
2,Tannhäuser comes in last.,"Don't put your money on this lame horse,... unless you have every other recording or video. Not one of Wagner's best stage works,- although musically quite revolutionary - Alden's pretentious, symbolic production reduces it to a travesty of what Wagner wanted and eventually achieved. Rene Kollo, as Heinrich Tannhäuser - a minstrel(?) lugs around a beaten suitcase with his songs, rather than his harp,is frankly past it and it's anyone's guess as to what they are all doing coming home from Rome,in Act 3. Only worth having for Waltraud Meier's 'Venus' - vocally and corporeally - wonderfully seductive, and Brian Large lets the camera stay with her as long as we can bear it. However all this is in Act1, and of course Venus never comes back. Certainly, all very challenging for the Munich public. Fortunately, Zubin Metha and the Nationaltheater Orchestra play Wagner superbly, and don't have to care what's happening on the stage behind them !"
2,"Wagner - Tannhauser / Mehta, Kollo, National Theatre of Munich","Wagner - Tannhauser / Mehta, Kollo, National Theatre of Munich is a 1995 production of Tannheuser that I was not that pleased with. The costumes and setting are too modern in my taste. René Kollo who plays the part of Tannheuser is too old and way too much vibrato in his singing. The opening scene is confusing and bewildering. It seems as if David Alden had the idea of being strange for no other reason than to shock his audience. I am huge fan of Wagner and this production is a travesty. Zubin Mehta the conductor simply does not understand Wagner. Listening to someone like Von Karajan conduct Wagner, you feel the passion and emotions. Listening to this production you feel nothing. A huge disappointment! Not recommended. 2/5."
3,"good singing, but very ugly staging","I was soon put off before the overture comes to an end. The venusburg was like a madhouse, and the crowd in the great singing hall was like just running out from a madhouse... Call me closed-minded, but I am fed up with these stage directors who simply produce ridicules and distractions to the music.Kollo is admirabe except a bit restrained in the high range of his tone. Meier is a (fatally) seductive venus. Weikl, like a psychiatrist, is reliable as usual. Secunde is a superb Elisabeth. All in all, they deserve a much better staging.Those who still do not have any Tannhauser on vedio should wait for the 1978 Bayreuth production (currently in LD format)."
1,"Overpriced, NOT EASY and broke within minutes of use","This item looks simple but does not lift ""EASY"" at all. You must insert a hexagonal driver to adjust up or down (NOT PICTURED AND NOT MENTIONED) - you cannot just move it up/down at a touch or turn of a wheel. Turning the hexagonal driver proved nearly impossible for a 190lb 6'4'' guy who works out. And the metal piece being driven? broke within minutes.Again, even if mine had a defective metal piece, it's still not easy. You'd have to inconveniently pull out the hexagonal driver any time you want to adjust it - you'll probably end up misplacing or losing this driver quickly."
5,"Margaret Ottley-Okubo, Author of Everyday Miracles.","Hearty and wholesome.A delightful meal for Mind Body and Soul.An inspiration to us all.I simply could not put this book down.The wonderful lyrics and exciting prose in this book entice the reader to sing and dance to the rythm of love and laughter, while savoring the splendor of authentic foods.A great work of Art.A family's vision of God's wonderful Creation.[[ASIN:0553375423 Everyday Miracles: The Inner Art of Manifestation.)"
3,Only 4 Episodes!,"Where are the other 12 episodes? Only the first 4 are on the DVD. I've already watched it the DVD and it was good, but would have been better with the full series.Hopefully WB has plans for more DVD releases."
4,Older Superfriends Are Better!,I purchased this dvd for my kids who are now in to the superfriends. We had watched several of the newer superfriend episodes and they are not the same ones we watched growing up. They really loved this dvd of the older superfriends.
5,Excellent!,"Boy, I've been waiting for a ""Superfriends"" DVD to come out for a long time. I got it the first day it came out and I practically ran home like a little kid to watch it. I wasn't disappointed. The sound is great, the picture looks fine and there are some cool extras...including a terrific Legion of Doom gallery with the villains' history and a short video montage for each one. Highly recommended for folks who grew up in the '70s and who eagerly watched the show every Saturday morning."
1,BRING OUT THE ORIGINAL SUPERFRIENDS SERIES!!!!,"The Animation in these is wretched. Bring out the original series with WENDY, MARVIN & WONDERDOG! Even though the stories were very mundane...they were true to the ALEX TOTH style and the HANNA-BARBERA animation was leaps and bounds better than the 1978 series!"
4,fantastic introduction,"This is a fantastic book introducing key concepts in O.T. worship in the light of New Testament fulfillment. The style is very accessible, and this could mislead you to think that the content is flimsy, but it is not.Especially helpful is his categories of ""sacred acts,"" ""sacred people,"" and ""sacred places.""I minister in a real-world church and I've read many books on worship (check out some of my other Amazon reviews) and this is essential. I'm requiring each of my staff to read this book this year.Tremper Longman is THE foremost OT in the evangelical camp. This book serves an excellent function in his formidable written output."
2,Sounds Better than it is,"The title of this book sounded great. However, upon reading it I have found it to be somewhat lacking in content. There is little depth; I recommend Clowney's book if you want a detailed look at this subject."
5,Untangling the Ivy League,"As a high school senior applying to college, I've looked at a lot of college guidebooks. Untangling the Ivy League has by far been the most helpful, especially the admissions chapter. It really offered insight and advice about life at all the Ivy League schools that I've not seen or read anywhere else. I'd definitely recommend this book."
5,Great Performce,"Newsboys has great music and I really like the drummer.One of my favorite songs are; Breakfast, Take Me to your leader, ShineThank you for letting me to write to youDavid Aiello"
3,Small disappointment,"They played all the songs I would have expected as of 2001. I was a little put off by the video itself. Some scenes were fuzzy and cloudy (by design I believe), plus some odd ""effects"" were disappointing, like the TV screen with cartoon characters.Also, why would they have their own music videos playing (of the song they were playing) behind them on a big screen, when they themselves are performing live? Very odd. My daughter mentioned how the lead singer looked ""freaky"". I agree with what looked like black eye mascara or something around his eyes, she also said (and I agree) he looked better with his hat on because the dark around his eyes wasn't as obvious.Finally, the audio wasn't great either, lyrics were difficult to make out most of the time, if I didn't know the words to the songs I wouldn't have known what they were singing.""Not Ashamed"", ""Shine"", and ""Entertaining Angels"" were the highlights for me, although the rest of their set was well done."
2,"Terribly edited--every 2 seconds, a new cut is made!","I'm sure the music and concert are/were great but this DVD is so poorly edited that it's almost unwatchable.The standard edit is 3 seconds -- that's the MINIMUM about of time it takes for the eye and brain to register an image. I counted edits here at one second and two seconds--it's impossible to focus on the concert because you see the guitar player for a second, then you cut to the audience and then to the singer and so on.The music videos are okay -- poor transfer from video to DVD leaves them with runny colors. The best of the bunch is probably ""Take Me To Your Leader"" because it's visually memorable."
2,Songs that ruined everything,"Just like the Saturday Night Live spoof, this is a Judy Collins album only for the most devote. While browsing for Judy Collins albums that I was seeking, I saw this and was gripped by some ineffable peri-purberal angst from 1972. I really love Judy Collins, but this is not Judith at her best, and I would carefully listen to the previews to make sure that this period of her artistry is to your liking...."
5,what an adventure,"I HAD HEARD THE NAME FRED BIRCHMORE FROM MY FATHER AND AUNTS IN ATHENS, GA WHEN I WAS A CHILD. I RECENTLY FOUND A FIRST RUN SIGNED COPY IN OUR OLD FAMILY HOME. WHAT A WONDERFUL ADVENTURE WITH MANY REFERENCES TO HIS HOMETOWN, ATHENS,GA AND HIS BELOVED UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA. IT WAS VERY INTERRESTING TO RELIVE THE WORLD POLITICS AT THAT TIME. THIS IS A MUST READ FOR EVERY CYCLIST. THERE WAS A RECENT FRED BIRCHMORE SIGHTING AT THE WOLF CAMERA STORE AND THE YMCA IN ATHENS.HE AND HIS WIFE CONTINUE TO WALK AND SWIM ALMOST EVERY DAY."
4,"Decent Item, but Bad Information","The case itself is a pretty good case for the price. However, the specifications are a bit wrong. Judging by what the case claims to fit and the fact that Case Logic's website says that the Dell Inspiron E1705 will fit, you would think that it would. However, the E1705 doesn't completely fit in the case like it's supposed to without considerable effort. If you have a widescreen 17"" laptop, odds are it won't fit in this case easily. Lots of pockets though, so it's a good case other than the problem listed above."
3,A decent ballad,It's good that she trying new things instead of the same bull that's out there. Mary J. is not a balladeer either!
3,Great content bad printing,Really great stuff in here form the old strips to the comments by Mort Walker and others - and strips not seen before too. The printing is pretty lame though - a lot of pages look like they were done on a photo copier - that had been photo copied from another photo copy. This volume deserves a much better package.
3,Smaller than claimed,"The quality and design of this little carrying case is great. My only problem is the case is smaller than they claim. My notebook is 1"" smaller lengthwise and widthwise than the size listed and it is a super tight squeeze. It's too small because of the way the zipper is attached and when I squeeze my laptop into the bag you can see the corners ""poking"" out through the neoprene."
2,It's Blue,"There's no info to the contrary, but the bag is BLUE, not BLACK.Otherwise, it's a nice bag."
3,Analyzing Twinship,"Stewart offers what may be the only sociological analysis of twins and twinship, emphasizing that ""twinship is an irreducibly social phenomenon.""She covers the anthropoligical perspective by focusing on twins in mythology, and moves on to the psychological research that focuses on personality and individuation. Stewart's insight as a sociologist comes in the second half of the book, incoporating symbolic interactionism and sociological social psychology to discuss the social construction of twinship. She tackles the dilemma of individuality, the impact twins have on the family, how twinship links to socio-economic class, and how twins present themselves in different contexts.Stewart's analysis of twinship is one of a kind. As a mother of twins and a European sociologist, her insight is keen."
4,"Nice, but the same ones...","It's nice to re-release these 2 films, at a very good price, considering they are $9.99 each at the moment. However it would be better if they released movies that are not yet released... ""Kissin' Cousins"", ""Girl Happy"", ""This is Elvis"", to name a few... Just the same old repackaging job again. Mind you, this has been the story of Elvis' career (while alive and especially now): re-release, re-package, again and again. There is still quite a bit of stuff not on DVD yet (I forgot to mention ""Elvis on Tour' and ""Elvis in Concert""), so why not them instead?"
1,Ellis Beastly Movies Steam My Clams!,"This man is reported to have loved his mother, and after I saw him on The Ed Sullivan Show, I looked further. In the five-whole minutes I spent on ""research,"" I could find no ""redeeming social value"" for ""Elvis,"" and a lifetime later, I still have no idea what all the fuss was about. I'm unsure who put the films ""Spin Out/Double Trouble"" on the page for me to review but if it was a computer, unplug it! Stand s/he who tapped its keys face into a corner for fifteen minutes of ""time out,"" and then mail me a copy of an essay, ""Why I Offended Neil and How I'll Keep From Ever Doing It Again."" Be ashamed!"
4,Typical Elvis,This is your typical Elvis movie. It is a very light-hearted and fun movie to watch. We enjoyed it and plan on adding it to our collection.
5,My Mom Is A Elvis Fan,"My Mom Is A Elvis Fan. This DVD is just what she wanted and received the DVD very fast. NOW, She dances and sings with Elvis day and night. Thank you very much."
4,Good Buy For Elvis Fans,"A gift for my wife, but I enjoy Elvis as well. People say Elvis' movies weren't all that great and even he himself didn't seem to like them. His fans did and these two (Spinout/Double Trouble) were a welcome addition to my wife's collection."
3,No Advanced-Usage Detail,"I was satisfied with Vendor price and delivery, however, I was disappointed in the lack of detail for advanced-usage, e.g., tips & tricks, detailed ""how-to's"", etc. This book is OK for overall illustration of capabilities but lacks the detail that is equivalent to the inherent capabilities of Visio 2003. I've learned the hard way, by trial & error, that Visio 2003 can perform very complex visuals but it is painful to accomplish. I've found that a combination of this book and Visio F1 `Help Index' will get close to what I'm trying to figure out. In my case, I've been using the Visio 2003 Building Plan to replicate my entire home floor plan for remodeling. I've used Visio 2003 very effectively for this but, as I've said, it's been a painful learning process that the book, I'm afraid, helped only a little. For the price It's an OK general purpose reference."
5,Solves an annoying problem,"Although I have dust collection on my table saw and other woodworking machines, the corner of my garage where my chomp saw resides is a mess. Sawdust on the floor, the walls, the shelves nearby, everywhere. The DownDrafter has reduced fugitive dust to near zero.It is a simple, well designed unit that easily adjusts to fit behind your saw. I have a Dewalt 12"" sliding compound miter saw and the DownDrafter snuggles up to the back of it nicely. When adjusting for angled cuts, the DownDrafter easily moves left/right on its wheeled stand. The hood swivels on top of the stand, independent of the hose, so movement of the hood doesn't make the hose twist.I have the DownDrafter connecter to a Jet DC1200CK canister dust collector with 12 feet of 4"" hose. There is plenty of airflow to capture most cuts. Rapidly cutting through 8"" of MDF 1 1/2"" thick, a dust nightmare, was a little more than it could handle. Slowing down the cut slight solved the problem.Overall, this"
4,Less dust on my face,"The downdrafter is a excellent help, I have to wear masks all the time when I work specially with vinyl or plastic material, Now I can fell the difference is less dust especially if I use the downdrafter in conjuction with a vacum"
3,Unfortunately a near miss,"I had high hopes for this dust collector. Unfortunately, it takes up too much space behind the saw and always has to be adjusted when making angle cuts."
4,Lots of Mischief,"I've enjoyed Laura Underwood's Keltora stories but I'm delighted to see this chapbook of four short stories set in or around her native east Tennessee.""Marking the Signs"" is about that old black magic, and the white variety as well. It reminded me of Manly Wade Wellman's stories. It is perhaps the best story in the collection.""Ghost Writer"" is more like a John Collier romp, a story is which a writer ghosts a real ghost. I hope this teaser makes you want to read the story. Give in to temptation and curiosity -- it's a treat that won't add to your waistline.""Blood Kin"" is a no-holds-barred, take-no-prisoners vampire story.""Nice Truck"" is a bizarre mixture of ""My Mother the Car,"" a bubba story, and vice avenged. It should be a dog, but it isn't at all. It's a very fun story.I expect to read and enjoy more Keltora stories by Ms. Underwood, but I hope she writes more stories like these as well. I'm not sure she's aware of how well she writes -- which may be part of her charm as a writer."
4,Going Beyond Tradition,"It is sad if we believe when God created us, He would place us in an unstable realm to exist, to be subject to disease, weakness, and dying, without an empowering ability to overcome them and live free from their effects. This practical understanding by Norval Hayes leads us into experiencing, not just knowing, by believing and putting application to the scriptures. I promise you this, ""Jesus is Lord. He will perform in you what Norval reveals in His book."" Why? God is immutable and cannot lie. But you are mutable, and can change. Your answer is nearer than you believe. Buy the book, it will help you know... You will live and not die."
5,BEST BOOK EVER!,"I had heard Joel tell stories before, and when I got this book as a gift, I knew I would love it. I started one night at eleven, thinking I would read a bit and then go to sleep. I finished the book at five a.m. I have read books that I couldn't put down before, but this one practically paralyzed me. I just had to keep going. It is beautifully crafted and well-told. If there is ever a rough spot in your life, this book will get you through it. Heartwrenching and wondefully funny, it is a book I will treasure forever."
4,Keeps you thinking long after the last page has been turned.,"It has been a few months sonce I finished this book. At first I thought it was just ok...not bad, but not a book that I would be recommending to others. Then a few weeks went by, and I found the stories popping back into my head, and I would smile. Then as more time passed, I started to relate to some of the stories that are so beautifully told by Joel and I went back and reread some of them. Now, after many months have passed, I recommended it to my niece and she and I have talked about the book, and its meaning. There is no doubt that it will keep you thinking long after the last page has been turned."
4,Good product,This product was easy for my child to use and came with all that she needed to clean her trumpet.
5,Very informative and practical!,"Tim Elmore is a visiting pastor at our church, northridgechurch.com in MI.We love his stories and insight on raising leaders that serve the Lord.We can learn so much for the stories of others and Tim is talented at taking someone's story and applying the lessons from that story to the rest of us. A very good read."
3,Interesting,"I have skimmed the book so far and am interested in some of the concepts, however, as a psychologist and leadership educator a few additional topics could be covered. And a warning, there is a fair amount of reference to Christian ""values""."
2,Jungles of Chult should not of been the place of happenings,"The story line is good but a few items should be addressed. The Jungles of Chult and the Harper themes did not go hand in hand. Too many ""luck"" happenings occured. The evil ""chaser"" follows him across the Faerun, everyone seemed to know about the Harpers(and in the Chult no doubt) and too many abstract characters with no common ground. The biggest flaw was there were at least 5-10 run-on openings with each character."
4,Good book for both beginners and advanced users,I have been using this book for the last three months and I couldcertainly reccomend anyone to use this book as a tool toget maximum out of SAS with ease. The author has done a goodjob in explaining things in this books. All the topicsare covered very well in the book from reading the variouskinds of datasets to writing out.Only thing which author might want to add in future is reagardingwith arrays as it needs more explanation then what it isgiven right now. All my colleagues have liked this book realand hold very high opinion about the book.Kudos to author for doing such a commendable work.
5,Excellent for learning SAS,"I came to SAS about 10 years ago with a strong background in statistics and computing, used Jaffe's book to learn SAS, and would now rate myself an expert SAS user. For me, Jaffe's book was excellent."
5,Honest Abe,The pictures are imaginative.Zeldis does a terrific job of making the paintings come to live. The pictures alone tell a story. The words by Kunhardt make the story enjoyable and easy to understand. The book has real events that occured when lincoln was president. Children learn about history and the events that took place during Lincoln's term in office.
5,COMPLETE MASTERPIECE!!!!!,"Look...This is a complete MASTERPIECE!!!I mean...Tell me 5 albuns that are better than this debut by THE DOORS...All the songs are brilliant, with one of the greatest vocalists of all time and a ABSOLUTELLY AMAZING BAND!!!I can't tell which song is a highlight, because all the songs are the best example of the greatest classic rock you can imagine...This debut by the DOORS is without any doubt in the list of the best albuns of ALL TIME!!!! THIS IS A COMPLETE MASTERPIECE!!!!"
3,"It's the rim-shot, baby.","It's not about the pseudointellectual ""poetry"" or the circus organ; it's all about Krieger's subtle guitar and Densmore's jazzy drums."
5,How could anyone not buy this album?,The Doors are the absolute masters of emotional psychedelia. Every song on this CD is brilliant. Standouts include The Crystal Ship and Light My Fire. I could listen to this CD forever. Buy it.
5,Having Been There,"Okay, I was there. I was 17 and saw the Doors play live. It was so mesmerizing, so ridiculously sexual that I love to hear this cd any time, any place, anywhere. Morrison in his black leather pants, young, virile, screaming/singing his passion. You betcha! And that's what this cd is about. Still holds up during these dispassionate times for those who want to rock!"
2,This Doors fan for 40 years wasn't ready for these mixes,"Maybe I'm missing something, but in comparing the new mixes with the '99 masters, I'm really disappointed.The first thing is that the volume, and thus the signal-to-noise ratio, is considerably lower than the older ones. That is just plain bizarre. Usually, a new mastering allows for a higher bitrate and a ""larger"" sound without any increase in distortion. That's the way it SHOULD be, anyway. So what happened here ? Further, all of the flourishes and oddities may just take some getting use to, but generally with great bands like The Doors, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.I'm not writing these new mixes off, just pointing out some unusual and, to me, problematic issues upon initial listening. I can say that when these records were originally released back in the day, I had no such problem. They jumped right off my turntable and blew my mind instantly. But, hey, that's just me."
5,The Doors 1967,"A true classic. One of the only Doors albums you ever need and its one of those classic summer of love 67' albums along with, surealistic pillow, grateful dead, are you experienced, and piper at the gates of dawn etc. The Doors were different the music they were making was heavy and dark and yet poetic all at the same time. They were litterly one of the most creative bands that came out in the 60s and too prove it listen to this whole album and you'll be nodding your head. Some key tracks on here are, Break On Through, Light My Fire, and The End. The song The End is a very apocalyptic song and is really kind of Jim Morrison telling a story or vision of the end of the world extremly great song. Now with the 40th anniversery albums out some songs dont sound the same like, Light My Fire for instance is more faster and isnt as dark and the songs sound more lighter but still this is a great album.5/5 stars"
5,The Doors Can't Really Have a Greatest Hits,"This one of the few albums that is just as good or better than their greatest hits. It was the first Doors album that I ever listened to, and I still believe it to be their best. It's never gone out of print. Another album that never went out of print and is much better than their Greatest Hits is SURREALISTIC PILLOW. -- Sam Yulish, author of WHERE HAVE ALL THE HIPPIES GONE and THE HESITANT PSYCHIC AND OTHER STRANGE STORIES."
3,Thier best work,"The Doors had kind of a thin sound, but it passed for arty. I always thought they could have been a great band if it weren't for Jim Morrison, who didn't have much of a singing voice. ""Break On Through"" and ""Light My Fire"" are two of the band's best songs, and I like their version of a Kurt Weil number. ""The End"" is a piece of overblown crap that marked the beginning of high school students wearing black."
2,Disappointed,"I love the idea of re-collecting my favorite albums on vinyl, but this particular album has a muffled sound quality to my ear. I'm not sure what ""180 gram vinyl"" is just exactly, but I'm not overly impressed."
5,Difference?,Is there any difference between these CD's and those issued in the Perception box set? Thanks.
1,Truncated Version of Light My Fire,"I was deeply disappointed that the Amazon MP3 album download included only the truncated ""radio single"" version of the song ""Light My Fire"" rather than the full length album version. Had I noticed this in advance I would have never purchased the album, even at the bargain sale price."
2,Don't Mess With Perfection,"I wish I could concur with the majority on this release and say the music had been enhanced, but I'm not hearing anything appropriate in these new mixes. After 40 years of enjoying my original mono & stereo pressings I was curious to hear what approach Bruce Botnick would take. In my opinion they decided to remove most of the subtle effects from the original mix in favor of ""digital clarity"" for a new generation.While I agree that the original release of The Doors was dark, I found it enveloping in a way that the new mixes are not. The keyboards on Light My Fire sound thin and fast instead of full and rounded, and completely mismatch the softness of Jim Morrison's vocals.Some classics are best left original, and this is one of them."
5,The first album CD debut for the lizard king and poet!,"An historical landmark milestone for Jim Morrison & The Doors from 1967. But hey the only songs I have is the five songs listed not all of them on my Best of collection. Like ""Break On Through To The Other Side"", ""Light My Fire"", ""Alabama Song"", ""The Crystal Ship"" and ""The End"" are my favorite tunes I've listened!"
1,Look Elsewhere,"In the entire history of rock, I cannot think of any group more overrated and undermanned than the Doors. A drummer with no bass player doesn't exactly set up a great rhythm section, and Robbie Krieger can't exactly carry the lead, rhythm and bass lines by himself. The keyboard sounds get old after a while.The passage of time has built this up to be cultish and great, but it never was. Please do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
1,I really loathe the Doors...,"...Look, I grew up in the Midwest in the 1970s and '80s and I heard a lot of this junk growing up, both from musical mentors and on ""classic rock"" radio and I am SO HEARTILY SICK OF JIM MORRISON AND THE DOORS. The guy was such a total weenie. Since when is getting so drunk that you fall of the stage a great moral virtue? And what a preening, self-centered gasbag!Of all the great hippie-era 'Sixties bands, the Doors are perhaps the least deserving of their legendary status... They had a couple of volcanic, primal early hits but the Doors catalog as a whole is so boring and bloated. Skip ahead to 1976 and crank up the Ramones: now *that's* real rock rebellion! (Axton)"
4,Great Album!,"The Doors 1967 self titled debut album is one of the best albums released. Everything about it so good. The songwriting, the production. This album has it all a great voice, great poetic lyrics, beautiful music and a cover to go with it. The organ that makes me wanna jump and the terrific guitar play and the drums and of course Jim Morrison poets that are one of the albums biggest highlight. All the songs are brilliantly made and produced and There are absaloutely no word to describe this great album 4 1/2 stars."
4,The first and (perhaps) the best,"The tracks on this album read like a list of The Doors' greatest hits. And with good reason; they are some of the best. Although Jim Morrison is often lambasted for masquerading as a poet, the lyrics on the first album are by far the least poetic. In fact, they are fairly simplistic (with the exception of The End, which I never liked). This album is a better introduction to the unique sound of The Doors -- that pulsating electric organ and Jim Morrison's sonorous voice. You can succumb to the trend and buy a set of greatest hits, or you can begin with the earliest material and listen how the band evolved."
3,A Crazy Sound from a Crazy Band,"(actually, 3-1/2 stars) I dig the Doors overall aesthetic, but sometimes I wonder about their execution (And whether organs should ever be a solo instrument). They had a habit of throwing in brilliant stuff with throwaways, but that doesn't make this debut opus any less listenable.My faves are the Oedipal madness of ""The End"" and their cover of ""Alabama Song/Whiskey Bar"". In fact, it was when I discovered that that cover was a Doors song that I decided to by this album. I was not disappointed. The full song sounds like a circus gone mad, and the refrain ""Oh, don't ask why,"" sets a strange premonition over the rest of the band's career. They're best songs were meant to be experienced, not analyzed, and the rest (like ""Back Door Man"" which feels like a retread), hey, that's the way creativity works, man...don't ask, just freak freely..."
5,"NEVER, EVER BUY A DOORS GREATEST HITS ****THIS IS THE BEST OF THE DOORS!****","Let me make this easy. Every track is, without a doubt, the best of the doors. Start here and then work your way up, cuz they're all good. Solid, solid stuff, this album will blow your mind. After this one if you want to keep going (which you will) go in this order....LA WOMAN.... STRANGE DAYS.... WAITING FOR THE SUN... SOFT PARADE... MORRISON MOTEL.... Then any live albums that you can find. These are all good, but make sure you've heard the whole first album first. Do not waste your time with a greatest hits."
5,The Doors,"This first album by the Doors is truly one of rock's finest. This album includes one of the Doors most famous songs, and the song that got them the recognition they deserve, Light my fire. Most of the songs on this album are good old rock and roll songs, except for the Alabama song (whiskey bar) which the Doors got from a German opera and The End which is the Doors' acid song and The Crystal Ship which sounds more mournful and sad. The End was featured in Apocalypse Now. This is a must listen album with popular songs including: Break on Through, Alabama Song, Light my fire, and The End."
2,teikoonisch,"The doors were an okay band from the late 60's with some good songs but a lot of them aren't here. Most of the songs here are mediocre at best and the rest are just bad, but hey this is their first album but they do get better later on. One thing about the doors is that their lyrics are very childish and laughable which no one can HONESTLY deny. The last song the end starts out good but as it goes on with it's silly lyrics it just seems to fall apart. Anyways you're probably better off getting a best of because it will include the only good songs from here on it, break on through and light my fire. Like I wrote earlier I do like the doors but this cd is pretty bland and forgettable"
1,Light My Fire is the raido version?,"I bought this album thinking it had the original long version of ""Light My Fire"" which it says it has. The real original version, remixed or not, is much longer than 3 minutes. That's maybe the version given to AM radio stations back in the 60's because the album version was too long for airplay? I had to buy the version off the box set which also says it's the ""album version"" but is over 7 minutes long. So, there are two ""original"" album versions of the song so be careful you buy what you expect."
5,Open The Doors,"The brilliance of the Doors' 1967 self-titled debut pretty much speaks for itself. Right out of the gate, this band were a rock force to be reckoned with. The towering voice, charisma, and sex appeal of singer Jim Morrison, the electrifying keyboard work of Ray Manzarek, the powerful guitar chords from Robby Krieger, and the incredible ace drumming from John Densmore all combined to make the Doors a truly unique band in the history of rock. Note for note, song for song, ""The Doors"" is a perfect debut album, with every single tune on the disc a Doors classic. Where to begin? ""Break On Through,"" ""Soul Kitchen,"" ""The Crystal Ship,"" ""Twentieth Century Fox,"" ""Light My Fire,"" ""Back Door Man,"" ""End Of The Night,"" and the 11 1/2 minute epic, ""The End""....heck, ALL the songs, simply outstanding. Morrison & company were, and ARE one of rock's greatest groups. ""The Doors"" is a total keeper."
2,NOT like the original release,"This was my first album when I was a kid in junior high. I've owned several LP versions and had the CD until my kids lost it. I replaced it with this expecting it to be faithful to the original, but was stunned to hear a different mix of Break on Through. Some ""genius"" added more vocals which totally ruined it for me. Don't screw with a classic. If you want the original version go to e bay and get the 1988 released CD."
5,THE Doors album.,"This is quite simply one of those albums that puts the ""classic"" in classic rock, and truly one of the best debuts in history. Every day their are people listening to this album for the first time and going ""wow""! I really like every one of their albums, but I can safely say that 9 of 10 fans would call this one the best. 8 of these 11 songs made the last ""Hits"" collection this is so good. I would have added 9. I'll say no more, but since the tracklist is currently missing here, I'll list it: Break On Through (to the other side), Soul Kitchen, The Crystal Ship, Twentieth Century Fox, Alabama Song (whisky bar), Light My Fire, Back Door Man, I Looked At You, End Of The Night, Take It As It Comes, and The End. A must."
5,Nothing Less Than a Masterpeice,"The first album for the doors is amazing. What I really love about the doors is that they could debut today in 2005 and sound new and original. This album is timeless. The only music I can recommend over this album is anything by Robert Johnson, or anything by Muddy Watters. Cream's Disraeli Gears comes close to this one as well. Although many Doors fans will hate this, I think there is way too much focus on Jim Morrison when people talk of the doors. The Doors couldn't have been the doors without him, but all of the other members were just as essential to the band. The only flaw with this album in my opinion are the lyrics towards the latter part of ""The End"". I think when Jim Morrison goes into ""The killer awoke before dawn..."" it interrupts the mood of the song. The End musically conveys the concept of time and love in my opinion and adding death and incest just doesnt work!"
5,Classic,"Must have classic. One of the many albums you must have in your collection. ""If the doors of perception where cleansed everything would be as it seems.... Infinite""!"
2,why?,"The Doors get 1,000 stars but this release s*cks...Imagine my shock when I first listened to this on CD, my suspicions were confirmed when another reviewer wrote they actually dubbed the vocals and CHANGED THEM....WHY?...will they overdub Hendrix guitar solos next? u sad, sick people.They CUT UP ""the end""... WHY? ... I am horrified. ALL the monstous glory of THE END has been...EDITTED? where did it go?... I'm going to fix up an old record player & go back to vinyl. you can't edit perfection, morons.whoever thought they could ""improve"" upon this classic should have all their toes broken with a hammer every year on the anniversary of this abominations' release date..."
2,The 5.1 mix is one of the WORST ever,I bought the box-set(Perception)and after listening to all 5.1 dvd-a disc I was so Mad!!! These are the worst 5.1 mixed i have ever heard! The first album is the worst of them all. there is NO surround. The back spkrs. are allmost silent.The other disc are not much better. Listen to them before you buy....would like to here if other's have had the same problem!!!!
5,One of the best debuts ever,"Along with Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin, this is one of the greatest debuts ever. It has ""Light My Fire"" and ""The End"" which set the tone for those epic Doors songs we're so familiar with. ""Break On Through"" is the one everyone knows, just a firey and driving and out of control song that just makes you beat your steering wheel as you drive or drum along in the living room as you hear it on the radio. ""The Crystal Ship"" is the most beautiful and melodic The Doors ever got. Followed by the raucous and punchy ""Alabama Song,"" the funnest drinking song ever. Then its predecessor, 20th Century Fox is about as pop as The Doors ever got but it's still a damn good song on a damn fine album. Check it out, it's great. Theren't many albums to which I can give a higher recommendation."
3,not very HAPPY!,"If you are looking for some decent happy hardcore music, try the Anabolic Frolic cds or the Bonkers cds instead! I just got this cd today and after I listened to it, I found that it was more breakbeat, techno, trance than anything else! CD 1 was the only cd in the set to pass as ""Happy Hardcore"" I would not recomend this cd for any happy hardcore beginner."
3,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"NOT A BAD DRAWER, BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. PRETTY QUICK TO INSTALL, ABOUT 15 MINUTES WITHOUT A DRILL. EASY SLIDE, HOWEVER YOU MUST MEASURE CORRECTLY FROM EDGE!!!! ONE NEGATIVE THING ABOUT THIS DRAWER IS, IT'S NOT ENOUGH ROOM FOR A KEYBOARD AND A MOUSE. IF YOU HAVE AN OLDER KEYBOARD CHECK MEASUREMENTS FIRST BEFORE YOU PURCHASE."
2,"big, easy to install but badly designed and part interferes","big, easy to install but badly designed and part interferes. the width between the holders of the drawer is too narrow so when trying to push the drawer back you have to force it in. Although this does not affect the functionality of the product but it is still somewhat annoying"
1,Nice Sound... Broken in 2 weeks.... Very upset!!!!,"I don't know if I got the bad one... but certainly it brakes easily...If you think i have bad technique let me tell you that i do have good technique in all the aspects... from the way I hold the sticks to the way your wrists and arms become a powerful weapon while playing... and the only thing that ive learned is that a china definetely has to be Zildjian, Paiste, or Sabian....On the other hand I highly recommend the crash cymbal from wuhan nice sound and durability..."
3,Wuhan China Cymbal,"Great cymbal. The down side, this cymbal doesn't fit in with the style of music I play. Examples,christian, contemperary christian, and gospels played in a major key. The up side, sounds great played with songs that are in a minor key."
4,Review,"Loud & Trashy... great tone, fast and short, immediate decay after strike. Great cymbal for this price. Highly recommend them.."
3,Caldwell Rock Jr. Metal Front Rifle Rest,"It is solid shooting rest. I wish it would raise up about 2 more inches ( the bench at the range here is a sitting bench and I have to hunch over a little..I am 5'11"". I wish I would have got a 9-11"" bipod Overall the product itself is good quality."
5,great purchase,"I do a lot of shooting with family and friends, this product allowed me to sight in several rifles after installing scopes."
5,"Works Great, Priced Right, Simple to Use","The title of my review says it all. However, here's a little more information.I am a casual rifle shooter. For zeroing a rifle or for simply having fun being super accurate, it is GREAT to have a reliable rifle rest to steady your shot. In the past, I have used random items that I carry with my to the range (a duffel bag, a box, etc.). But, these are inconsistent, usually not comfortable and make it hard to find a good ""zone"" of accuracy.The Caldwell Rock Jr. is perfect for the casual shooter who just wants something that works right out of the box, is easy to set up and easy to adjust.Unless you can justify the fancier dials on the more expensive models, this Jr. model is a great value. It is solid, heavy and feels like it will last forever. I highly recommend it.Good luck!"
2,Not good enough for me,The pad is attached by velcro wrapped around the metal piece and there is always alittle wiggle. I will try glueing it on with liquid nails. If that does not work Ill be looking for another rest.
4,Rifle rest,"I haven't been to the range to use it, but goes togather well and seems sturdy. Should work fine and the price was right."
5,Grows on y ou,"I bought this for my two year old and didn't love it at first listen. Was expecting something livelier. My son liked it (though I think he was initially drawn to the colorful cover) and now I listen to it about 10 times a week. I've come to love this album. It's fun, and swings, and feels happy without ever feeling cloying. Definitely not Kenny G. The ideal album to listen to first thing in the morning, or right after you wake kids up from a nap. Great to listen to while you dance around in the living room."
5,great music by fantastic players,"thanks to the artists for a disc of such interesting music - works that are generally dumped into the ""curiosity"" category are given legitimacy; byron rescues them from obscurity with flair and panache. this is what happens when you take really intelligent musicians and get them excited - an obvious talent (in addition to great playing ) of byron's. from someone who pursues music as his principal passion on life, it's great to see such inventive music being lavished with the virtuosity of byron and his players. buy this disc - you will not regret it!"
3,Respectable but...,"I suspect some folks are buying this album for the Raymond Scott tunes. If so, please, please, consider buying the original. Byron's effort is respectable, but he somehow manages to suck the life out of Scott's tunes. With few exceptions, they sound as though they are being played by sedated musicians who just want to get it in the can and move on. If you can tolerate the decreased production quality of the original, you'll get a lot more music, I assure you.Bear in mind that I'm speaking only about the Raymond Scott tunes, such as The Penguin, War Dance for Wooden Indians, Siberian Sleighride...If you do nothing else, compare the original version of The Penguin to this one before buying. It's available here as well."
3,SPICY!!,"When they say spicy, they're not kidding! This is so super spicy. It's okay in taste. I don't view it as some amazing flavor."
4,Good,"This CD has a lot of Dance-Pop and more club-oriented songs. Includes my favourite hit on here ""Arms Around the World"" by Lousie. The other songs are just as good. This pretty good compilation. The cover boys are real cute, too."
4,GREAT SUPPLIER,The quilt was much nicer than the picture. The supplier will do anything to solve a problem for you. Ask for Ann
2,mediocre at best,"The review from Nov 2001 hit it on the head. Formulaic, although easy to read. Yes, some good info, but very simplistically presented. Also, a bit of an ego issue here as the author apparently feels his philosophical musings carry the same weight as Plato or Lincoln. Along the same lines, it is AMAZING how many ground-breaking community police initiatives were apparently newsworthy from the community of Nutley, New Jersey (the one the author happens to hail from)."
5,Prompt Delivery and Accurate Description,"The fact that I could make it only halfway through the second novel in this book before deciding it just was not a series I going to enjoy does not change the fact that this book was in excellent condition, as advertised. The delivery was prompt, and I think the seller's work was excellent. They can't help that I just don't like the novels."
5,An Elm Creek Quilts Sampler,"This was a gift for a friend, who has been reading and enjoying it since its arrival and will share it with other friends when she has finished.I'm a quilter, and my son-in-law gave me several books in the series. The Elm Creek Quilters books are good reading for women of all ages, quilters and non-quilters. But quilters and women who like the ""country"" decor are probably this series' greatest fans.And, of course, Amazon did the usual good job of shipping."
4,An Easy Read,"I really enjoy the Elm Creek Quilts books, having just discovered them. They are easy to read and I find myself becoming very interested in the lives of the characters. My only complaint is that many of the situations they find themselves in aren't very believable....but that's fiction for ya! I love the description of the quilts and the detail that goes into telling about making them. I love that there is a website to see the quilts from the stories. These are just fun stories and I'm glad to have bought the book!"
5,Elm Creek Novels,"I bought this book for my wife. She says - 'I love the first 3 novels together though it is a big heavy book. As a quilter, I feel the characters are part of my quilting group and I would love to spend a week at quilt camp with them. Now I will have to read each novel in turn and, indeed, want to make each quilt as their story unfolds. I love the fact that there are quilt pattern books to go with the novels - I want both.'"
5,It is about my friends,"I have all the Elm Creek books and have loved everyone. These stories are about me and my friends. I have passed the books on to all my friends and they feel the same way. I cannot wait unitl April, when her new book comes out."
5,love it,"Thought this would be ""old lady"" type books - but they are wonderful and relevant for today . Did not disappoint!"
5,Great Read,"For anyone who loves quilting and a writer who develops characters very well, this is the book for you."
5,Elm Creek Quilt Newbie,"This book was quite enjoyable. As an avid reader and quilter, I found pleasure in being able to share time with both. The sampler was an excellent opportunity to get started in the series without spending a great deal on every book. The next three novels are on on my xmas list! Not sure who wins, my book or fabric stash!"
5,It will make you want to quilt,"What a lovely trilogy of books. I hate to sew but Jennifer Chiaverini has made me want to make a pot of tea, put a thread in a needle, sit with a bunch of friends and create a work of art with fabric."
4,good but not great,"Positives: It's one of the few books out there that offer info. on development specific to the golden--when to expect certain milestones, when to spay/neuter (there is reason to wait),personality changes at certain stages, etc.Negatives: Some topics covered felt more like a biology textbook. I was ok because I have a medical background but could easily see how those chapters could turn the lay person off. Furthermore, I wish the book had more depth in certain areas and less in others.Overall, a good book to own. Not perfect, but after browsing through many golden books, this one came closest to what I was looking for."
3,Just Okay!,"I have read about 20 Golden Retriever books and the writing on this was ""all over the place."" Some of the information I did not find accurate as far as feeding Goldens 30% Protein b/c 1 vet she spoke to advised this. This book does not keep my interest as well as the other Golden books. I only recommend it b/c I believe Golden owners love to read every book out there regarding this wonderful breed."
4,My Puppy,I am very happy with this book. The information was written so that it could be easily understood. As a resourse it is excellent. You should have a puppy before you read this book. The information is easily applicable.
1,Unreliable,"This thermometer became erratic soon after we bought it, and it failed completely in less than a year."
2,unreliable,"I've owned this thermometer for several years and it has failed as often as it has worked. When the temperature gets down toward zero (when you care most about knowing the temperature outside) it only displays LLL. If the battery in the transmitter is toward the low end of its charge store, there is not enough power to send the signal to the receiver which displays only a line of dashes. If the receiver battery is low, it may still display only dashes even if the transmitter is sending a strong signal.Too many things can go wrong with this unit, I would not recommend it to a family member."
1,Not Reliable,Ordered two of these. One works like it should the other does not work. It won't accept & keep the signal from the outside temperature sensor. Would have cost too much to return as this item was inexpensive.
5,The right product and price...,We purchased this as a replacement for one that we had loved and depended on for years. It was exactly as advertised and works perfectly.
5,Fung's Solid Mechanics,"I was an acquaintance of Professor Y.C. ""Burt"" Fung when he wrote his classic Solid Mechanics book - ""Foundations of Solid Mechanics."" He had just left Cal Tech to work in the field of Biomechanics at UC San Diego. This book contains much of the same material, updated to the present time, with very nice historical writings about the founders of Solid Mechanics. This is an excellent reference for anyone that considers themself a solid mechaniker."
3,Good to know wide overview in solid mechanics,"It's good to have a wide overview in Solid Mechanics, but it's not very clear explaining finite non-linear deformations and finite element analysis. There are better and more modern books for that. Sometimes it's confusing."
4,Hawaiian Dictionary,The best content but typefont is so small that many will need a magnifying glass to enjoy it.
5,"Hawaiian Dictionary: Hawaiian to English, and English to Hawaiian","I am a new Hawaiian language student, and this wonderful book allows me to look up words and definitions either from Hawaiian to English, or English to Hawaiian. I especially like this book because the font size makes it easy to read. I have visited Hawaii over 40 times in the last 32 years, and just wanted to be able to read and write the language. Now that I am retired, I have time to devote to perfecting my own use of the language and culture of my happy place. If you have simililar inclinations this book is a must."
5,A needed guide for living in Hawaii,Mary Kawena Pukui's Hawaiian Dictionary is a must-have reference for anyone living in Hawaii. The book has the best and clearest translations of Hawaiian words that I have found. Many books on Hawaii have their own explanations of the meaning of Hawaiian words and chants. This dictionary is the source I use for the definitive definition of a Hawaiian word. The book has a guide on pronunciation and provides multiple definitions as well as use of words in sentences.Knowing the meaning of Hawaiian words and place names has added to my enjoyment of living in Hawaii. Correct pronunciation of Hawaiian words is critical if you need assistance or directions to a location or street with a Hawaiian name. Thanks to the University of Hawaii Press for continuing to make this dictionary available.
4,"Hawaiian Dictionary: Hawaiian-English, English-Hawaiian",The dictionary contains definitions of Hawaiian words and translations from Hawaiian to English and vice versa. It is much better than the tourist editions that are published. These are short and imprecise unlike the Mary Pukui dictionary.
5,Hawaiian Dictionary,"It only took a couple of days to get the dictionary. It was in great shape, and the price for it was nice too."
5,Great!,"These guys can play music like nobody's business! Pete Wentz is an amazingly talented writer, and the song titles don't even begin to prove it. With names like 'Nobody Puts Baby In The Corner' (My fav.) and 'Our lawyer made us change the name of this song so we wouldn't get sued', You know you are in for some amazing lines. The lyrics and beats are simply amazing, and it never ceases to amaze me how great they can be. Heartfelt and more mature than their earlier music, this cd is wonderful. Only a couple of songs have screaming, but it's actually not bad at all. Buy this! It's my favorite cd, and i own 100+ cds."
1,this band is as punk rock as a pink dress. stay away at all costs!,"its been said so many times on here that this is just a boyband posing (VERY BADLY) as a punk rock band that everyone knows that by now and lets face it it HAS to be just a matter of time before not just kids but everyone stops listen to this junk cause everyone knows that all of this sugury sweet pop crap isnt cool and is just going to go away it cant last and soon listen to it will just make you the most uncool person in the world and i agree the sex pistols are punk rock in its most raw, hardcore form and if anyone wants to know what real punk rock sounds like they should listen to the sex pistols album -Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols- or listen to any sex pistols album for that matter and if they arent willing to listen to give that a try or if they just handle that then they should just except that they are just part of the pop crowd and leave the punk rock to people gives it the respect it deserves"
1,bad bad stuff,"but what more could you expect when Jay-Z pimps out a couple of clowns for a quick profit? I mean, really."
3,STOLEN SONG TITLE,"I don't know about their music (I guess Sugar We're Goin' Down is pretty good) and I'm not here to bash on Fall Out Boy, they're just musicians, and their music is for their fans and not everyone. All I know is that they stole the song title ""I Slept With Someone in Fall Out Boy and All I Got Was This Stupid Song Written About Me"" from the hardcore/grindcore band Daughters (their song is called ""I Slpet With Someone From Daughters and All I Got Was This Stupid Song Written About Me""). The Daughters CD (Canada Songs) is on amazon if you wanna see for yourself. Just thought I'd let you know."
3,"Decent, but not as good as TTTYG","From Under the Cork Tree is the CD that has put Fall Out Boy into the mainstream spotlight (and also given them many new ""fans""). I, for one, love their previous CD (Take this To Your Grave), and believe that FUTCT is not nearly as good. Highlights of the CD include Our Lawyers Made Us Change The Name Of This Song So We Wouldn't Get Sued, Nobody Puts Baby in the Corner, A Little Less 16 Candles, A Little More ""Touch Me"", and the album closer, XO (which is easily the best song on the CD). But the rest of the songs (yes, including the singles) seem to lag behind. If you want to listen to Fall Out Boy, get Take This To Your Grave. It's a much better CD."
5,simply amazing,This CD is made for any hard rock fan. This is the best Fall Out Boy CD yet. No collection would be complete without it.
3,A cool band and cd,"while i lost most of my respect for fall out boy after hearing what they sound like live, i still like this cd. it's got several songs worth listening to over and over"
4,Yup,"OK, so ""From Under the Cork Tree"" has the strong central theme of nothing, and as my cousin pointed out, it's more or less the same song 13 times over, but I LOVE THE DAMN CD, OK? I've actually managed to get my ears ringing, but I'm too stupid to take my headphones off or just turn the volume down, and the people that live in this house are unnapreciative of proper music. Jeez, you'd think this was redneck Texas (no offense to Texans). . .Apart from such comletely irrellevant info, I'm permantly damaging my poor ears at the moment and have used up 10 batteries on this CD (once again, too stupid to just stick headphones in my boombox), so it's pretty damn good."
2,Not quite the same Fallout Boy...,I really wanted it to be good. Unfortunately halfway through I had to stop the cd and put 'Take This to Your Grave' back in. I don't know why they cut back on the originality and emotion from the first cd in favor of cookie-cutter pop-punk. Perhaps it will grow on me after a few more listens.
2,read this its the truth!,"At first i liked this cd ALOT but after awile of litening to it,IT SUCKED!it gets old and annoying!and i just saw there new music video were there vampires,its the most stupid thing ever!!!!if u want to c a good vampire music video watch aiden.fallout boy is a bunch of posers if i think about it there music gets annoying and panic at the discos out if u want a GOOD cd.dont waste ur money on this when u can buy sumthing better.there old and boring when they first came out they were good but now there not.and dont watch there new music video its so dumb and it seems like they copied aiden and it doesnt evn go with the song."
5,Great CD,I think that this is a great CD and possibly one of the best that I have. I don't think that there is a problem with people loving their music and becoming fans after hearing 30 seconds of it. That just shows how good all of their songs really are all the way through. This CD is a must buy.
5,closest to a masterpiece that a pop-punk band could create,"first off, i listen to very diverse stylings of music, and have never come across a pop-punk band or album that i could call a ""masterpiece."" pop-punk just doesn't tend to push that musical envelope. but, fall out boy's follow up to the very good take this to your grave is quite possibly the closest a pop-punk band can get to. almost every song is good, and i find myself skipping none. the album does lack a little bit in the middle, but it does end with a bang. for those who claim that this new album is not another tttyg is ignorant and doesn't understand music. music is an evolution process, and fortunately for fall out boy, the evolution was for the better. i'm tired of hearing people complain about bands ""changing"" their sound, if you want to listen to the same sound over and over again, start your own band and play the same song over and over and over.......again. if you listen closely, it's the same good ol' fall out boy."
2,It's kind of sad,"Sadly even though fallout boy is completly different from the band from taking back sunday i see them using the same style of lyrics and stealing ""i'll be your number one with a bullet"" which happens to be one of taking backs sunday track names from the album ""where you want to be"" also the catchyness is just irritating and gets stuck in your head, plus i have never seen such sellouts. Honeslty, im awhare that a ton of people found intrest in fall out boy and not because i dont listen to them my sister owns this album and i just go wow.Honestly folks they used to be good until they got super trendy."
1,Another band that sounds the same as all the others (sucks),"well the band sounds like a yellow card,simple plan,panic at the disco,all american rejects etc. ALL of the bands have the same sound and music that a person from 10-17 would buy. And you proboly saw the video before hearing the song on the radio. If your older 18 and up. you need to get in to some GOOD music. Try the ramones, the offspring, sex pistols or even green day."
1,ONE OF THE WORST BANDS EVER! STAY AWAY IF YOU RESPECT PUNK ROCK!,"why do people that call themself punk rockers listen to this empty pop crap? its like what that one reviewer said- why is this junk even listed under punk rock? anyone who knows what real punk rock sounds like knows that this isnt real punk rock, its just boybands who want to seem tough and/or deep. if you want to know what real punk rock truely sounds like in all of its raw, hardcore form then listen to the sex pistols album -Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols- or listen to any sex pistols album and then, if you cant handle that, please stop calling yourself a punk rocker, ok? - we have to start listening some good music (even if its from 20 years ago) and stop watching trl and watch some worthwhile tv if we are going to ever see any good music come along"
1,"They make Simple Plan and Good Charlotte sound good, wow!","As you can tell by the title of my review Fall Out Boy has done the impossible. This not punk. Punk is the Sex Pistols, the Ramones, the Misfits, the Clash, Black Flag, but definitely not this. This is not music either. What is it? This is a way for the music industry to steal kid's money, because these kids do not know any better. The singer sucks, the guitarists suck, and the lyrics are asinine. If you think I'm out of line, well let me know when Fall Out Boy makes a cd as good as Sad Wings of Destiny, Reign in Blood, or Peace Sells, But Who's Buying. Until then Fall Out Boy rides it hard and long. Check out my other reviews if you have an interest in real music."
2,1 song good.,"If you are looking to buy this album after listening to the song ""Dance Dance"" do not be fooled. It is a really good song, but if you're looking for other songs like it on this album, don't. it does not have any other really original songs like this one. They fall into the same category as All American Rejects and Simple Plan- nothing new; nothing different."
3,"happy about some things, not happy with others.","the seller said that it was in good condition, and the CD itself was, but the case is broken. wasn't expecting that. i would complain and try to see if i could return it to get one that is in better condition, but this edition of this CD isn't the easiest to get a hold of."
4,FOB's best,"this is honestly the only album of fall out boys that i enjoy. the songs are well produced and sound great. the lyrics are definitely catchy. the only parts of the album i dislike are when pete wentz ""sings"". and i say that in quotes because he can't sing at all. he's terrible. i realize he writes most of the stuff but leave the singing to stump. overall a very fun pop punk album. a little on the dark side. but good."
1,The worst of the worst,"Here are some reasons why fall out boy are the worst band,you cant understand a thing the singer says,they dont play any guitar riffs,they dance like dorks... this band makes a7x sound good, and they suck!"
1,HAHA,"don't listen to that other guy... Go buy some Psyopus, Ion Dissonence or With Passion and compare them to Fall Out Boy... Really, really pathetic, isn't it?... exactly."
5,Just funning...,"Fall Out Boy ""From Under the Cork Tree"" is pure fun for me. I'm in my early 20's, probably over the intended demographic, but I love this band and their music. It's just fun stuff to dance around to or sing along in the car. I think the band had a lot of fun making the album, and I have fun listening to it. Okay, occasionally, some of their stuff is heavy-handed (to say the least), but I believe they meant it ironically, and even if they don't, I sing it that way.I don't get music snobs dissing bands like this. Established ""good"" bands only got there after being around for decades. Fall Out Boy has a chance of being the next generation's Green Day (Don't shoot!).I loves me a witty turn of phrase, so I really love this band and album.Give it a chance if it strikes your fancy, if not, whatever, that's cool too. I just like this CD, even if I'm alone in a sea of pre-teens."
3,Mediocore,"Middle of the road pop-punk that regresses from their previous album.Check out ""Take This To Your Grave"" and pass this one over."
1,save your money,if they played good music/were talented/didnt suck then i guess it would be worth the 12-15 dollars....
2,basic,"I have seen these boys live and let me tell you...this is NOT what they sound like. The magic of studio has pumped this album up so much I can barely handle listening to two songs without thinking that it's a totally different band. Very basic album, and the long song titles are just stupid. Amazing how they went on tour with a bunch of bands that have long titles for their songs and then they come back on their new album with more long titles!! yeehaw. The reason was ""we feel a song shouldn't be limited by the number of words..."" Give me a break."
1,ever heard of Led Zeppelin?,"I truly hate this band. They are too winy and their singer doesn't sound like a man. He sounds like an eight year old girl. For you people that actually like this s*** go buy some Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, or Iron Maiden albums. Wait!!!!! no don't buy them, you will probably die because they aren't so winy and actually have guts. Oh My God!! They also actually sound like men and their guitar players know how to play!!! In 5 years people will not know this band. They are in what I call the poser group which is Fall Out Boy, Panic! At The Disko, Good Charlotte, My Chemical Romance and any other pop punk or emo band that has ever existed."
1,take this fake junk off the punk rock listings-ether your punk or your pop-give punk rock the respect iit deserves!,"1st off i would like to say that IM NOT A KID now, why is this junk even listed under punk rock? anyone who knows what real punk rock sounds like knows that this isnt real punk rock, its just boybands who want to seem tough and/or deep. if you want to know what real punk rock truely sounds like in all of its raw, hardcore form then listen to the sex pistols album -Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols- or listen to any sex pistols album and then, if you cant handle that, please stop calling yourself a punk rocker ok?"
1,WARNING: Fall Out Boy Makes Your Ears Bleed,"Patrick or whatever his name is, the lead singer, his voice is awful. I've listened to it and it's just horrible. I don't know how some people say he sounds like Panic! at the Disco's Brendon Urie, because this guy has no talent. Panic! at the Disco kills them in everything, vocals and music. Panic at the Disco used to be awesome, well, they still are, its just they need to put the ! back in their name and write and perform songs like they did on their first album, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out. They are amazing! But these guys, oh no. Please, help yourself out by not buying this cd. Buy Panic! at the Disco's music!!!"
4,Good for what it is,"Am I the only one who thinks compairing fall out boy to classic rock bands from the 1970's is crazy!?!? Come on people, don't be stupid; the two are totally different. If you're 40 years old and grew up on bands like guns and roses and fleetwood mac, you're probably too old to be into FOB anyway (which is probably why you're not, duh!). If it makes you feel any better; in 20 years, my generation will classify FOB as classic rock, and whine about how the post-neo-soul-punk-goth-experimental-crap of 2027 is garbage. Happy? Yes, I'll admit that FOB is nothing new and really played out at the moment, and yes, they were WAY better (totally awesome) in the ""take this to your grave"" (2003 indie release) era, but for gods sake, give it a rest. For what it is, 'tree' isn't all that bad. 3 1/2 somewhat solid stars. I just hope their next record isn't hijacked by the mainstream the way this one was. Wishful thinking, right? Probably."
1,Blasé and Boring,"Let me start this off by saying that I'm a thirteen year-old girl, the supposed target audience for this album, and not a cynical old man like most of the people here giving one star reviews. With the exception of Dance Dance, the the only good song on the entire CD, everything Fall Out Boy writes sounds exactly the same. This music is like pop/rock set on easy-listening mode with a terribly annoying and whiney vocalist. I'll admit that Sugar, We're Goin' Down is tolerable, but it's just an exceptionally catchy version of the same tune used in the other eleven songs. I'd recommend not wasting your money purchasing From Under the Cork Tree and downloading Dance Dance. For a somewhat similar band that writes much better music, check out Panic! At The Disco."
5,stop comparing,"This is a very good cd. Stop comparing it to Take this to your Grave. Theres no point saying that its not as good. Look at it from the point not thinking about any other cds and ask yourself ""Do I like this cd"" Don't think about how it compares you are just a freaking retard if you can't look at how a band wants to change their style a little bit or have songs tha tmay be better for them to do. And not just try to appeal to what the masses will like."
1,Why did Joe Strummer die?,"How could Punk turn into this crap? Emo has to be the lamest genre around. All it is is whiny losers talking about slitting their wrists or getting dumped. The songs on this crappy waste of disk have some of the lamest names Ive ever heard, (I slept with one of the guy from fall out boy and all I got was this song about me)see what I mean? Who buys this? Seriously, Emo is for queers. P.S: that lead singer guy is really anoying, he has really queer side burns and wears a stupid hat all the time. Save us, John Lydon!"
1,MAINSTREAM EMO NONESENSE,ANYONE WHO LIKES LISTENING TO GENERIC WHINING NONESENSE BY A BUNCH OF EMO SELL OUTS BUY THIS ALBUM... ANYBODY WITH HALF A BRAIN PROBABLY WOULDN'T LIKE THIS CD. MAYBE FALL OUT BOY FANS SHOULD TAKE A LITTLE TIME TO ACTUALLY EXPLORE WHAT GOOD MUSIC MIGHT BE... BETWEEN THE BURIED AND ME FOR INSTANCE...
3,"ok you're old, get over it, i dont care","i'm reading the reviews on this website and i cant help noticing all the people who are all ""i remember when music was good..."" blah blah blah.... i'm sorry, but i dont care. i like this music. i dont really care how ""hardcore"" or whatever you keep going on about a song is. i just happen to like this music. to anyone who is reading this: dont let people who dwell on how good a band is in comparison to what they listen to warp your attitude towards music. i listen to this stuff and i like it. it makes me feel happy and its fun to dance to and thats all i really care about personally. because not everything is going to be an earth-shattering work of incredible brilliance. so just let it go, and enjoy the music.p.s. i'm not really a kid it just takes too long to subscribe and all that"
4,"How these guys got labeled as ""Emo"" I'll NEVER know...","I think these guys have a lot more in common with Bowling for Soup than any Emo/screamo band I've ever heard. They're just another powerpop/punk band, but a pretty good one at that. This CD's pretty solid all the way through. If you like catchy hooks, driving beats and/or a Creed-like guitar sound, you'll dig this."
4,Pretty good stuff!,"I love fall out boy. None of the other songs are as good as the ""dance dance"" one or ""sugar we're goin down"", but they are all good....."
5,I LOVE FALL OUT BOY,"i'm not going to go into detail because i did that on my 'take this to your grave' review but i have not regretted on buying this CD from day one. it made me an avid fall out boy fan! all the songs and lyrics are great (even though it took me awhile to warm up to 'dark alley...' at first i hated it but now it's sort of growing on me).patrick stump's voice is AMAZING and it's easy to get hooked. the music is also very good... pete wentz's lyrical genius is obviously evident.go and buy it... not a waste of money at all!and if you don't already own it, but their debut 'take this to your grave'....i'm not actually under 13... my computer's just screwed up. :-\"
3,Just a comment,"This isn't so much a review of the album- I've only heard 2 songs off of it, ""Dance Dance"" and ""Sugar We're Going Down""- as it is a comment to the reviewer who wrote ""F***ed Up Boy"". I take offense to the way you stereotypically lump together and pretend to know everything about people who like ""this kind of music."" I like all kinds of music- I like classical, I like the Rolling Stones, I like Tom Petty, I like pop, and, yes, I like the two songs by Fallout Boy that I have heard on the radio. I haven't heard their other songs, but I am interested in them, and I found the titles amusing. Anyway, get off your high horse and accept that not everybody is going to hate what kind of music you hate, and not everybody is going to like what kind of music you like. Grow up already!"
2,hmmm...,"Why are these guys here? I listened to their cd to be fair, and it's not typical emo. Leave the emo to My Chemical Romance and Yellowcard."
1,Its these kinds of albums that ruined rock,Ok people you think what you're listening to is music. Well its frickin not. This music is horrible. Its guys playing simple things over and over. Thanks for ruining good music fallout boy YOU SUCK.
4,Take My Advice,"Everybody wants this CD, but... the heavy meatl parts in the last few songs wasn't for me. I wish I didn't buy the CD, because I'D be better off downloading it off Lime Wire!!! BUY IT!!! ESPECIALLY IF U LIKE A LITTLE HEAVY MEATL! I SAID A LITLE HEAVY METAL!! NOT ALOT THOUGH!"
2,its ok...,"take this to your gave is waybetter this cd is aight mean some songs r really good but im happy i burned it, def buy nine inch nails, queens of the stone age, all that remains, or wait for foo fighters, and this is coming from a big fall out boy fan."
1,Poor - Here's Why,"Many people think just because Fall Out Boy's members have metal origins means they have great guitar and excellent music. That Great guitar and excellent music are part of metal is true, though not vice versa.Incredibly annoying - Breathy vocals, song titles that screams ""TRYING too hard to be funny"", and to top it off, stupid repetitive lyrics. Some people like it, and that's fine. Remember, it's a fact of life that a certain proportion of people are stupid.Excellent music? You would wish that, wouldn't you - not-helpful voters?"
2,Meh.,"I'm...indifferent. They sound too much like someone else without enough of themselves to really stand out. I was given a copy of this CD by a guy who admits he likes emo and Kylie Minogue (apologies on spelling). This...is not punk, and not good enough at emo.For emo, I'd listen to AFI. For punk-rock, I'd listen to MCR, Linkin Park, or Sex Pistols.But this is just my opinion. Sorry."
3,So over the emo punk thing,"Eh...im being generous. This album should only get a 2 and a half but im a nice person. Dance dance is good, but the video sucks. I HATE sugar were goin down. The lawyer one (sorry too tired to type the whole title) is good. Panic at the discos got competition: Who can run out of breath first just reciting the titles of the songs.Listen to punk rock not punk emoGo Green Day and Sum 41!!!"
3,not bad,"well the vocalist kinda sucks ,i cant really understand what the vocalist is singing most of the time because it sounds like hes saying ""eeeeeeeeeeeeee"". check out ""nobody puts baby in the corner"" youll know what i mean."
5,Another great album,"Fall Out boy have really outdone themselves with this one. Ther e new more upbeaty sound comes through really good. THe lyrics are weird and kinda hard to understand but with Patrick's voice you hardly notice. My favorite tracks are (of course) Sugar were going down (Which just won them the MTV2 award about an hour ago GO FOB!!!!)and Dance Dance, which is like the catchiest song EVER. Anyone who is at all interested in fall out boy should get this and Take this to your grave which is there other album and is just as good or better."
1,my ears!,"fall out boy should run over to the barbor shop and ask to get there hair cut like each member of the back street boys, there horrible, sure they have catchy tunes but if you like back street boys and fall out boy its fine, but if you listen to real music like rage against machine, the used then you should not be listening to fall out boy because they are back street boys with instruments"
1,MTV garbage,This is horrible and it does not even deserve to be called music. This should be destroyed. If you like this you must be a brainless twelve year old girl who will listen to anything that is on MTV.
1,OH MY GOD,WOW I CAN NOT EVEN SPEAK OF HOW HORIBBLE THIS ALBUM IS WOW DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY PLEASE DONT BUY IT
2,From Under The Dork Tree,"What's the deal with these guys? I don't understand what the whole hype with FOB is about.I heard MTV liken this band's lonely Moose Boy (from the music video for Sugar, We're Going Down) to Blind Melon's Bee Girl. What the f-ck!?! How can they even suggest that? The Bee Girl was an iconic symbol and she represented how being different makes you unaccepted. Moose Boy is moronic. Anyway, I'm sure half of the teens out there are like 'Who's Blind Melon lol!'This music is okay as far as radio trash goes. But to consider this emo dance music 'serious' and 'deep'; that's just ludicrous.The lead's voice is two seconds away from thoroughly annoying, the bass is..wait? What bass? The guitar is all over the place and meshed badly, and the lyrics, though funny, are not food for thought."
3,Just okay.,"I picked up this disc after seeing a live show by Fall Out Boy on TV. I though they sounding unique and really enjoyed the show. However, the disc didn't seem to capture the same excitement and effort that they put out on stage. I got bored with this disc after a few listens and have already moved on."
2,Eh...,"I think there are only two or three songs on this CD that I actually listened to but now, I can't even remember what they are. I purchased this CD when I loved a couple of their songs and basically just wanted to have them. I had a gift card here and it was cheap, so that explains everything. This is one of those CDs you listen to and only a couple songs are all right. Nothing to brag about, nothing to go crazy about and none which you remember later on. The titles, however, are pretty sweet and original. That I do like, even if it makes me forget the song I liked even more...Basically, it's not going to kill you to skip this CD. You'll live."
4,okay...,"From Under The Cork Tree has a different sound from earlier fall out boy music...I think the music is mellower and more cleaned up than Take this to your grave (not to take anything away from that cd). This album is filled with catchy songs and most of them have amazing pop sensibility. I would say just listen to this album and take it as it is. People seem pretty quick to start bashing fall out boy but wether you like them or not you cannot deny their song writing abilities. My opinion is to not just judge them by the songs you here on the radio...just listen to the entire cd all the way through at least once. It is a pretty solid cd as far as im concerned. Haters will hate, but oh well."
1,Wow falloutboy is really really terrible,"Falloutboy is yet another emo band that is popular with teenage girls and guys that wear pants that are too tight. Their lyrics make no sense. The guy's sideburns are so gigantic that they are covering his ears and I have come to conclude that he can't hear the terrible music he and his band are playing. If only we all had gigantic sideburns like that guy. Must the guitarist do that stupid guitar flippy thing EVERY five seconds? This band is lame. This music hurts to listen to. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM, DOWNLOAD SUGAR I'M A CLOWN, OR WHEN THEY'RE ON FUSE CHANGE THE CHANNEL BEFORE IT GETS STUCK IN YOUR HEAD AND YOU WANT TO DIE!Fallout boy is queer. Long live- The Rolling Stones,The White Stripes, The Allman Bros, DMB, Hendrix, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Zeppelin, and The Doors!!!You were fairly warned!"
1,Worst CD of the year,"Want to listen to a band that is unoriginal and that there are so many other bands that sound just like it that you want to get sick? THen go no further that Fall out boy!Now, seriously, if you like this album alot you obviously have not listened to music for that long cause theres millions of bands out there that sound just like this. There songs are annoying as crap too. Whenever I hear one of their songs in a resturant or somewhere like that I wat to go up to the manager and scream, 'Don't play this horrible music! You're only dsigracing yourself!'Please, buy He Is Legend, Mae, Recieving end of sirens,or something else but not this HORRIBLE CD"
1,ROFLMAO!,"I usually don't do this, but I just could NOT stop laughing after reading the title of one of the reviews: ""This album should be a 2006 Grammy Nominee""LOL! OMFG...that has to be, BY FAR, one of the most idiotic things I have EVER, EVER heard in my life. Grammy Nominee? This mediocre album would be lucky if it got shelf space in a discount rack at Wal Mart."
1,huh??,"Why is this so popular? The singer has one of the most annoying and nasaly voices I have ever heard. Bottom line, this music is just plain boring and leaves you wondering, ""Was that music I was just listening to or a bunch of random noises strung together in some random order?"""
5,the greatest cd ever!!!,well i kno some of the songs sound the same but they are all good.with their catchy songs like sugar we're going down. and many others
1,1 STAR IS NOT LOW ENOUGH,"AAAGHHHH, this band is TOTAL CRAP. I am SO sick of all these bands that sound the same and their tone deaf fans who think fall out boy is original. I'd rather eat my own poop while pulling out my fingernails with a hot poking iron than listen to ""sugar we're goin down swinging"" again. If you like this band, you need a hearing aid. Easily the worst part is the singer, who some how makes lyrics like ""Lie in the grass, next to the mauseleum"" into ""Die in the brass, RRUHNNEEEAAHH"". I kid you not. Listen to that peice of crap and tell me it doesn't sound like that with a straight face."
1,"I'll give you 50 bucks if you can figure out all the lyrics of Sugar, We're Goin Down just by listening to it","I'm a fourteen year old eighth grader and I guess this is the kind of music I'm supposed to be listening to. Ummmmmmmm.........no. There is absolutely nothing good to say about this album. I had Dance, Dance stuck in my head all day today, but all I could do was hum the tune because you can't tell what the guy is singing!! All I hear is ""Dance, dance, befonnhhmthremmndutyyhtremmm.... Dance dance, mmunhtuhhnngnkhhggthtnnfhtneenr....etc. Ugh... Are we sure this guy is even singing? Please DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!! THE WHOLE THING IS A JOKE!!! Listen to someone good like Led Zeppelin or Green Day. Even Bowling For Soup is better than these fake, incomprehensible fools!!"
2,Whut happened?!?,"I'm getting to the point where I'm almost wishing that certain indy bands don't get noticed by ""major"" labels. This album was on my list because I loved Take This To Your Grave. I don't generally like the whole ""power pop"" genre (re: Good Charlotte, an EXTREMELY OVERRATED band), but TTTYG's smart songwriting and better than the norm rhythms hooked me. This album however suffers from the same problem that most indy bands have when they jump to the ""big time"", a general disconnect with what made you great. It's why I prefer Tell All Your Friends over Where You Want To Be; The Fake Sound of Progress over Start Something; Full Collapse over War All The Time(even though it's a good album); they just seem to lose something in the translation. The songwriting is still there but the actual music is the same cookie cutter stuff that MTV addicts eat up and vote for on those stupid countdowns. I just hoped for better from them. Label me disappointed......again."
1,This CD could not suck more,So this is what we have come to. Weird guys with no thought for people with good taste. Fall Out Boy makes MTV lovers scream all over for whats his face and his huge sideburns. This is not a good thing
4,Took a while for it to really snap,"The first time I listened to this CD, it really got me pumped. I listened to it several times over the first couple days but then it slowly just moved to that part of the collection that I don't really pay attention to anymore.Then as they released ""Dance, Dance"" it reminded me how I liked that album so I popped it back in again. Now I can't stop listening to it. It's so damn catchy. I really like almost every song on there. ""Dance, Dance"", ""Of All The Gin Joints In The World"" ""7 Minutes in Heaven"", ""I've Got A Dark Alley..."" and ""A Little Less Sixteen Candles..."" are my favorites of the album.Basically if you're into catchy music you'll most likely like it. If you listened to the album and didn't really like it, I'd recommend giving it a couple more listens just in the background. It's a very good album."
5,I love Fall Out Boy with a passion,"As an avid fan of Fall Out Boy for close to 3 years now, I was overjoyed when I finally got the new Fall Out Boy CD in the mail from my pre-order. It was all i expected- and more. Pete outdid himself on the lyrics of this song..I don't know of one person that can't relate to at least one of the songs. They have matured musically and lyrically from Take This To Your Grave while still maintaining the brilliantly unique and personal feel that their original fans love. With Patrick's unique vocals and guitar, Pete's amazing songwriting abilities and bass, Joe's powerful guitar riffs, and the drumming of Andy, they are able to produce a brilliantly full sound. Fall Out Boy has never let me down yet, and I don't think they will at all in years to come."
4,Better than I thought...,"When I first heard those high pitched screaming mumbles on ""Sugar, We're Goin Down"" I thought, ""wow, this has to be one of the worst bands of all time. Abnoxious vocals over lame-o punk stuff"" Yet, over time, and a few go-rounds in my CD player, this CD has truely grown on me.Personally, I haven't taken much time to listen to the lyrics, so, i'm unsure as to how meaningful they are--I'm goin' strictly on sound here--and it's not bad.Looking at the titles of the songs, you can tell they're a very 'goofy' group, but, give them a chance--actually more than one chance.FAVORITE SONG: the fast paced, wild ""Dance, Dance"""
1,THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST BANDS EVER! STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!,"(...)why is this junk even listed under punk rock? anyone who knows what real punk rock sounds like knows that this isnt real punk rock, its just boybands who want to seem tough and/or deep. if you want to know what real punk rock truely sounds like in all of its raw, hardcore form then listen to the sex pistols album-Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols- or listen to any sex pistols album and then, if you cant handle that, please stop calling yourself a punk rocker ok?also stop watching trl, maybe if we let it goaway something worth listening to will come along"
2,Sophomore Slump or Comeback of The Year?,"Sophomore Slump or Comeback of The Year? I think the former answers that question. Why you might ask? It's definitely not Patrick's impressive vocals, the wailing drums or soaring, crunching guitar riffs. It will likely be the pretentious nature of the bassist and his ignorant, rip-off lyrics. The first album was gorgeous, fresh and refreshing to say the least. This new album was a mere attempt to replicate the first album, but with a touch of forced lack of creativity and ""let's make it completely obvious that we're trying way too hard to impress the wrong crowd"". I gave this garbage two stars because there were only two songs I was impressed with, ""Dance, Dance"" and ""Sugar..."". I don't mind that ""Sugar..."" made it to MTV to be portrayed to the teeny-bopper, hot-topic generation, it is after-all a good song. But the fact that this album has been allowed to hit the shelves with a price-tag of more than 9.99 really bugs me."
1,Ugh...,"I hate this band and the songs are retarded. If you like walking contradictions and flat out idiocy, then please feel free to support this ridiculous band.Please let this stupid fad be over."
3,"""lyrical genius""-No","Fall out boy is great. I won't lie, I loved the first album, and this one is good too, but to say that this album creates them as ""Lyrical Genius'"" I have to say, NO WAY. It's catchy, and it's another pop/punk cd like the rest, but it is not classified under Lyrical Genius's I personally think bands suas Brand New, Taking Back Sunday, Finch & The Used can be classified that way, but Fall out Boy? No."
1,Punk?,"This is not punk. Sure they use the ever popular ""pop punk"" form but make no mistake about it, kids, this is NOT punk rock music. It's not even good music I'm afraid. It's music made for the 15 year old and under demo. The clueless little HS and JRHS girls who have been ""hurt"" by life (ie: boyfriend dumps her). By all means buy this CD if you hate music. But if you want to hear real punk music go check out any of the following:T.S.O.L.Anti-FlagLos CrudosDFLRamonesM.O.T.O.Bouncing SoulsNofxRaimundosThe Sex PistolsGuns N' WankersXScreeching WeaselThe DamnedLimp WristDescendentsThe above covers a variety of styles.Open your mind, stop listening to what everybody else in your school does.Go wild"
4,i dig it yo!,"wow, this record is getting bashed a little worse than i thought it would. i agree with the dude below me, some of these kids emo pants are getting a little too tight to open there minds and accept that this band has encountered evolvement. honestly, what else do you want from the band? they are dedicated no matter what! i used to watch them at local shows before they were even on fueled by ramon and they seemed like very promising people. so it would be kinda dumb for the band to write another record that sounds very much like the last. i listened to the whole thing through once, i found a couple tracks a bit predictable and cliche, but there are some really solid tunes featured on this cd, i didnt mind spending the 10 bucks all together. but yeah, ""take this to your grave"" totally blew this one out of the water in my opinion. people please give this a few listens, its really not so bad."
3,Fall Out,"the cd that made fall out boy popular, a few good songs, like dance dance, and a little less sixteen candles..., but has some lag on the fill in songs. id reccomend it to avid music lovers. but it is already a best selling album so it pretty much talks for itself."
3,get over it people,"ya congradulations to everyone who hates this album. i personally love it. but what makes me laugh is that u guys spend ur time going out to look at the album that u hate just so u can bash it. way to have lives!!!. o ya and i LOVE hendrix, red hot chili peppers and the doors and they are WWAAAYYY more popular than these guys will ever be so stop pitying the oter good music and get over it cuz although they might not be the next hendrix, theyre not goin out of style any time soon"
1,ugh,"Well, FOB suck for one thing, Also They cant sing nor play their instruments, i wouldnt waste my money on some band that cant sing or play their instruments. If you Want better music go buy some other good band thats not on MTV! i hate MTV they suck. so eeryone goes OMGOSH FOB ARE AMAZING. well theri nto even close.Their terrible. the complete opposite of amazing. you all probably just bought this album and like them cuz their on MTV , well just dont buy it. Its not good for you im sure. OR else dont go to their retarded concert whre you cant even hear the song well, they cant PLAY THEIR INSTRUMENTS CORRECTLY OR SING!( i saw them at the VMA thing and some other thing on FUSE)Even simple plan can play theri insturments AND sing too!. their way better then this. So go buy their albuM! DOnt waste your money!"
1,Worst Album in History!,"drumroll please... worthless Emo band Fall Out Boy have released an album where they sing about sleeping with boys and getting cut with a razorblade while they kiss each other just like they do on their shows. They also try to brainwash you because they say they don't use the internet, blah blah blah... the real story is they couldn't find a job, so they started to screech and fake playing guitars and someone really intelligent from the business heard them, then he signed them on a label that must be suffering a lot this year, and started developing subliminal messages in the form of 12-word-long-title songs. If you think this is worth your money, you're really, REALLY WRONG. Buy real Rock music, not Good Charlotte, or Simple Plan, or any Emo or Pop or Punk. BUY REAL ROCK, like Korn, Incubus, System of a Down, Smashing Pumpkins, Foo Fighters, The Mars Volta, they are real bands but no one notices nothing because they're too busy watching MTV and buying Fall Out Boy CDs."
2,Whiny!!!,"I tried to get into Fall Out Boy once too many times and it gives me a headache. My brother got this cd and tried to get me into the cd. I couldn't, it's just too whiny. Although I do really like ""Dance, Dance"" props for that song...it doesnt sound like the rest of the stuff."
4,Fall Out Boy ~From Under the Cork Tree~,"Fall Out Boy comes out firing with their third full length album, From Under the Cork Tree. Riddled with infectious pop hooks and melodies, this album dances the thin line between emo and pop-punk. The upbeat rhythms make the often ironic and heartfelt lyrics that much more potent. You can't help but have the words to the albums smash hit """"Sugar, We're Goin' Down"""" stuck in your head while but bobbing your head back and forth listening to the albums second single, """"Dance, Dance."""" While not entirely original, not many bands are crafting this sort of hook-driven emo-pop with as much skill as Fall Out Boy. Taking the formula bands like The June Spirit and New Found Glory started, this band has taken five steps forward and moved the bar even higher for the pop-emo genre. For Fans of: The Starting Line, New Found Glory, All American Rejects"
3,Would have been better had the radio not overplayed the songs,"I really like some of the songs on here, and it's the kind of cd that I'll still have when I'm 40 that my kids will listen and shake their heads at. The good songs that are on it made the radio, not really any hidden gems on it."
4,FOB rox!,"fall out boy is awesome!! i went to see them on tour and they sounded even better than they did on CD! This CD rocks, by the way. ""snitches and talkers get stitches and walkers"" is horrible but other than that its all good. my favorites are ""sugar,we're goin' down"", ""sophmore slump or comeback of the year"", ""dance,dance"", ""i've got a dark alley and a bad idea that says you should shut your mouth"", and ""xo"". u should definitely buy this CD and go see FOB on tour!"
4,pretty good,"just have to say, ""PunkPrincess 909"" and ""Melissa, omigosh i love FOB"" and everyone else like you...yall suck. ""i mean i totally love this album like so much its like overwhelming..and the singer is like so hott..maybe i should go and shoot myself *giggle*"" for one, PunkPrincess, why review one outta ten if theyre all gonna be 10/10 for every song except the last five? and obviously your a poser if you think of yourself as a punk just because you have a screename with PUNK in it. and punks, cant be princesses at the same time. thats just stupid. melissa, your just trying to be cool and popular by listening to this CD which i h-a-t-e. everyone in MS/HS are so shallow...so its a pretty good CD. i like it, but not because its popular. im sick of the radio always playing crappy songs over and over. or playing the good ones so much everyone hates them."
1,why does people listen to weak crap like this dont you know theres better music out there?,just because your a kid it doesnt mean you have to listen to fake pop crap like if you want to listen to some real punk rock listen something like the dam-ed or the sex pistols and let this crap die out already so something worthwhile can come alongand like the other reviewer said people should stop listening to trl also that crap just rolls out the same safe fake bland pop junk over and over agian why do you want to waste your time with that? let trl goaway and will then get to see what real rock is really like
5,go fall out boy boy.,"fall out boy is one good band. good musiconship, great melody and sh#t. i just hope they are still making good music in a couple years, when they get passed the ignorant minded high school bullshoot."
1,Don't do it to yourself. You kids deserve better.,"Maybe I'm a little old. Like 29. Mad old. But what's up with the kids these days? Why do you listen to this emo-soft-punk? Life is short. Do you hate rock and roll and punk. do you hate music that moves you. Explore and get in touch with something that really rocks. This is mad sap wack...Makes me wanna vomit. You're all brainwashed by the industry to like this. You don't even know about Wire, Stooges, Velvet Underground...Please kiddies. Well...you'll do what you want anyways...I guess I'm old now. At least you aren't listening to Linkin' Park anymore...I think."
1,lol another panic at the disco,"fall out boy grabs the attention of all the teenagers. I give them my respect for being a big time band. but this music is not so great, I understand why people like them, but this is just average stuff at best, maybe a little below average. give them a few more years and they wont amount to much. but like I said I dont want to be a basher on here, im just saying ive heard way better, and these guys probably wont write much better in the future... enjoy it while you can."
1,"This album is full of crap, except for one song.","This album is ridiculous, lame and unimaginative. The song titles are so long, and only one song is half-decent, and even still it's a lame pile of emo garbage made by some wrist-slashing whiner.In summary: this bites!"
1,Did not meet my expectation,"Just an ordinary double sided tape. Was not strong enough to hold my rear spoiler. I would not recommend this at all. Bought it because of 3M brand, but like any other product, not what it used to be."
2,not what i expected,"good price, but not what I expected. This one sits in my carousel for a long time. Does not taste like coffee."
3,Not my favorite of the Green Mountain brand...,I ordered the lake and lodge because the description sounded as if it would be very flavorful. It is not bad but doesn't taste as it is described. At times it tastes like burned coffee. It is not my first choice of all the Green Mountain coffees. I prefer the Nantucket.
5,SIGH OF RELIEF,"My old bike seat was really awful, so this one felt amazing in comparison. It took a few days to get used to it (after putting up with my old one for over a year), and to adjust the tilt just right, but it is really comfortable now. No wedgies or soreness from riding. It's just the right amount of cushiness and springiness. I wouldn't say it's waterproof, but it is fairly water resistant. I can wipe rain water off with my hands, ride it across campus, and have only slightly damp pants, not noticeable enough to care about.And it doesn't look weird or anything, which give it major bonus points with me. Nor can it be classified as a ""granny"" seat.It's very comfortable and it doesn't do anything it's not supposed to. Basically it's what a bicycle seat should be. Buy it."
3,Ray Charles Live,"As a great fan of Ray Charles, I was disappointed in this particular CD. There are at least 6 tracks of only instramentals, which were good, but not the reason I purchased this CD. I wished for more vocals from Ray himself. I had not heard any cuts of this album previously, so this is my fault to have expected more."
3,Too many instrumentals,"I ordered this CD (used) expecting lots of the master bluesman's searing lyrics, but the first 5 or 6 songs are all non-vocals. While these tunes are imminently listenable, I was disappointed. The rest of the tunes are classic Ray. If you like vintage RC and his big band jazz orchestra, this one's for you. BG"
3,I liked this,"Overall, I liked this CD; however, of the soloists, I liked the bass performer the best. He had a depth and added drama, without going ""over the top""."
1,not what pic looks like,"I ordered this keyboard from amazon...they shipped a different kensington keyboard..it has a large l shaped entry key, which changes the layout..i am returnng it to amazon"
5,Beautiful and Powerful,"I read this book in 7th grade, and it has remained with me ever since. For years after reading this story, I dreamed of having a Borzoi dog when I grew up. Not a practical dream. It is a beautiful and haunting story for those who love dog books, but it's a sad one. The wonderful thing about this story--the true power of it--is that it will never leave you. Once you've read it, it just kind of becomes a part of you. I keep this one inside my heart, always."
3,This book left me wanting more,"This book was a rough overview of the Temps, but had some rarely seen photos. One thing concerned me was how the name came about, Cox says that Otis Williams thought of the name, and Otis' book says that he didn't remember who thought of the name. I suggest you go to the library and get Otis's book also just to get another point of view."
4,"THE BOOK WAS ""OK"" JUST NOT ENOUGH","AFTER SEEING THE RECENT T.V RENDITION OF ONE OF THE GREATEST GROUPS THERE EVER WAS, I KNEW I HAD TO KNOW MORE. I GREW UP WITH THE TEMPTS AND CAN REMEBER WAITING FOR THEIR NEXT HIT RECORD. IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE AT THAT TIME IT SEEMED THAT THEY WERE BATTLING THE MIRACLES, AND IT WAS GREAT.ALTHOUGH I KNEW ABOUT PAUL, DAVID AND EDDIE, I SOME WAY OR ANOTHER MISSED THE DEATH OF MELVIN AND WAS SADDEN BY THE FACT HE IS NO LONGER WITH US.I READ THE BOOK NON-STOP, BUT FROM THE BEGINNING LOOKING AT THE SIZE OF THE BOOK WHEN I PULLED IT FROM IT'S SHIPPING CONTAINER I KNEW RIGHT AWAY I WOULD WANT TO KNOW MORE, AND THAT'S WHERE I AM NOW. THE BOOK WAS ""OK"" I'M SURE I WILL READ IT AGAIN, AND AGAIN..BUT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE.LOVE YOU OTIS..."
1,Don't buy ''professional website promoter'',"Beware, Don't buy this product called ''professional website promoter''. I just bought this software and had it installed, it asks me for a registration #. You can not use this software without buying a license which is around $300.00. Also the programs in the software cost money to use. Nowhere on the box it says that you need to purchase a license in order to use this product. Its all hidden in the license agreement, but you would never know it unless you opened the package and tried to install it. These people are real scumbags and they havent heard the last of me."
4,Look a little deeper,"This is actually a neutral review, as I have not yet purchased the product, but after reading the first review, I called the company. I had heard that this was a good company and good product. The Customer service rep told me that as long as you have the number provided in the package, there are no extra costs to run this program. If you lose the number, you can call and they will give it to you. There is also a 30 day return time if you aren't satisfied. I would think that if all customers were as disgruntled as the first reviewer, all products would be returned. Apparently they aren't. I hate to see anyone's name smeared needlessly!"
5,This book will make you smile,"I purchased this book recently, and it made me smile reading through it. The snippets of prose coupled with Wim's photos are a great combination. Genius."
5,Your 2000 babes calendar should show more babes of color.,"I had never heard of Anne Geddes before. My sister was nice enough to send me a 1999 Calendar of babes. Every one in the office, including my self loves her work. Some had even thought about collecting. One concern. We would had like to see more babes of color (different nationalities). But all of the babies are so beautiful, you can't help but appreciate this ART. (Just a suggestion)"
4,NOT BAD....,"A nice touch of the old school.It really makes you think of those same thoughts you had in those early days of writing.Music is dramatic,but it grows on you."
5,Very Good Work,"The first volume of this three volume set is exceptional. The breadth of this work is substantial. In fact there is so much ground covered in this work that many truly momentous events are covered in what seems a very short number of pages. Most of us think that the history of the US goes something like ""The pilgrims wrote the Mayflower Compact, jumped off the boat, ate thanksgiving turkey, hung some witches, dumped some tea and declared independence."" Morison does a fabulous job of filling in the spaces. Morison's style is very engaging as well. It is interesting to note that this volume was published in the 60's so there are frequent mention's of communists themes and when the author mentions native Americans he means people that were born in this country even if they had ancestors from England or other European countries. Highly recommended."
2,"Not for women under 5'4""","I am 5'2"" and these stockings come up to the very tops of my thighs so that the whole garter effect is lost. It might be worth shortening the garters so that they stretch taut the way they're supposed to instead of bagging limply, but then again it might not. The stockings are about the quality of drugstore pantyhose and don't seem like they'll last long without pulls and runs. They're inexpensive, though, so if you're few inches taller than I am, you might get your money's worth of fun out of them before they're wrecked."
2,Way too stretchy,Way too big and stretchy! The garters are about 3-5 inches too long and the stockings fall down after wearing a short time.
5,More info than I really want to know,"Since the football season started my husband can't tear himself away from it. When he's not watching the games, he is looking at stats, reorganizing his fantasy team, and going to football ""support groups"" - as I call them. I decided I'll impress him a bit. I picked up this book at my local bookstore. Compared to other similar titles on the market, this book proved to be superior. It has a lot more information: extensive lingo vocabulary, history, rules, team descriptions, stats, trivia, and a lot more. It even has a few game-day recipies. Its size was also a winner with me, it fits nicely in my purse.If you are like me and would like to get to know football, buy and read this book."
2,Decent book...but isn't for chicks who know nothing about football...,"I bought this for my wife, who knows shopping, shoes, and Us magazine...and nothing about football whatsoever. We expected this to be a guide to football for someone like her (given the title). But it assumes some basic knowledge of the game and it does not go to the trouble of defining terms before they are used. It is very dense if you don't already know football.This book seems reasonably well-written, but it is definitely not for women who know nothing about football."
1,"Terrible writing, bad editing. Not worth your time or money.","This book is full of typos, grammatical errors and factual errors. I love football and was deeply hurt to see the subject treated with such disrespect. The woman who wrote this is absolutely talentless. Trust me, it's painful to read. Don't bother with it."
4,Beautiful product but needs better parts QC,"I am an intermediate level woodworker and this is my first router lift. I bought it to use in a shopmade router table, and I am very happy with it so far. I have been freehanding everything with a VERY old Craftsman Router up until now. I need to buy a new router to use in this system (I'm thinking Bosch 1617EVSPK so I'll have a plunge router, too, if I need it). This lift is a precision instrument, and seems to be based on a design used by Jess-M and Rockler as well. My only complaint(s)... it comes with six threaded inserts to use in it's leveling system. Two of the six inserts were defective (bad threading). Also, the leveling screws (nylon) are too short to use in any table much more than 3/4"" thick. I had to go out and search for a new pair of inserts and longer leveling screws to use with my table."
5,Rousseau 3002 Router Lift LS,"The Rousseau router lift is really a Jessem under the covers. It performed as well as any router lift could with a 2.5max HP Dewalt motor. I found the graduations easy to read and the crank mechanism easy to turn. The accuracy was as good as any of the other lifts I have but at a lower price. I would recommend it to anyone who is thinking of adding a router lift to their table. I purchased this with the MLCS cabinet saw extension table. I had a good fight to get the table mounted to the saw.The Rousseau router plate did not fit as snug as I would have liked into this table. I had to do some interesting engineering to get it secure. Once secure onto the table, The married up combination of the router lift, plate and router table performed great."
3,not good for a kid,I bought this for my son and the cannon didn't even make it out of the box. It snapped right off. I looks more like something you would have for show not for kids to play with.
5,An unforgetable story,"Emotions versus knowledge and an easy to understand science lesson as well. I read this book to my firstborn so often, that it fell apart before her sister arrived on the scene. We just never got tired of reading it over and over again. The book is appealingly illustrated and the story is captivating. - Please bring this book back to print!"
2,"Ouch.... I just don't like it, but it'll be in my collection","Though I collect this movie as an eccentric genre of British 70's, I really don't like it. Looks like series of ""Carry on...."" british classic comedy movies. It tell you story about 4 overseas girl in London who seek for job, while studying language & culture, of course with all sexplotation. If you like british 70's, you'll like this movie. I mean you will enjoy the sound of carribean light jazzy, that make me laugh.I think I got this recommendation from Amazon since I look for movie of Me Me Lay, a pretty Asian-English who appear on Jungle Holocaust. Really, I was amazed by her appearance as a cannibal in JH and hope I got the same or more appearance since this film 5 years earlier than JH. But I was dissapointed seeing her cubby cheek. O, she really magnificent in JH, but make me sick in this movie..."
2,Pales in comparison to the other Antonelli books,"This 4th book in the Antonelli series was quite a disappointment. The first 3 books were well written with tight, interesting plots and subplots. Half way through this one, I had to force myself to continue. The characters were not well fleshed out, one of the ""twists"" in the story was very obvious from the beginning and overall it was a confusing and muddled tale. Near the end of the book, I found myself looking longingly at the stack of other books that I have available to read and I wound up scanning the last third of The Legacy just to finish it off. I guess all authors have a clunker now and then. I hope this was Mr. Buffa's misfire and that future books in this series will be as entertaining as the first 3 were."
5,Exactly What I Needed,Needed this for doing brake work on our 2006 Expedition but impossible to buy locally (even from Ford). Don't know why these are so hard to find but thankful that I could find it online for a fair price.
5,Living in the Gap between Promise and Reality,An insightful and practical book about faith as illustrated in the life of Abraham. Faith is waiting for God to fulfill his promises.
1,unsatisfied,The math bridge book has pages ripped out of it. So I am not satisfied with this book at all.
3,Good hard case except the inserts do fit the are too short .,I bought this case and this seller was extremely fast yet the case was lacking in that the dividers that came with it were too short making it hard to impossible to use them . You might end up sticking to just the foam that it comes with are maybe you get lucky ? This case fits a Canon 300d with an installed battery grip great . all round its a good case though I should have paid half the 50 bucks that I did for it .
2,"Don't take into the Sun, skin bubbles up.",This case is ok for the price but don't take it into the sun as the covering bubbles from the heat. Not highly recommended.
3,Could have been better.,"Item arrived at last minute, and damaged. Have yet to have it resolved. Have bought another one elsewhere."
3,"good, but not as expected","If you think that Program sounds like This World and Body, you're wrong. Program lacks of the creativity and power of Marion's first album: guitars are less distorted and the production seems to be less elaborated. It's obvious that Marion were short of ideas during the writing/recording of this album. Still, there are some good songs (Strangers, Smile, Comeback, Sparkle). If you're a Marion fan, you must definetely have to buy it; but if you only like brit pop and This World and Body didn't turn your world upside down, you can save that money and buy something else."
3,underated,"i give ""world&body"" 3 stars because of the ""time"". actually this second album is better overall,""come back"" & ""what are we waiting for"" & ""miyako hideaway""are pretty compassionate & i like the vocal of Jamie Harding v.much."
3,Not for super dry skin,"I LOVE theMurad Resurgence Age-Balancing Night Cream, 3: Hydrate/Protect, 1.7 fl oz (50 ml). I have really dry skin and that product is fantastic, so I had high hopes for this eye cream. It is thick, but not emollient (for me), and I must really need that extra oil because I feel like this just sits on my skin doing nothing. I tried using it on my face, since it isn't working under my eyes, but it does not feel like it soaks in or does anything. Basically, it doesn't feel good - on MY skin. I'm not giving this a low rating, because I realize that what works for one person won't work for another. The skin under my eyes actually hurts if I don't have enough moisture/oil in the product. The only eye cream I have found so far that feels really good and makes my eyes look and feel great all day isSkinceuticals A.g.e. Eye Complex Mature Skin Treatment, 0.5-Ounce. I'm always on the hunt for a lower price replacement, but Murad Resurgence Renewing Eye Cream one is not for me."
3,Good character study and great to see some famous faces pop up,"I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for a number of years and finally got a chance to see it. Will say this... Jack Nicholoson is in great form in this movie. This was the movie he made before ""Chinatown"" and he still had all that pent up power we had seen in ""Five Easy Pieces"" and would see even more of in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" in 1975.Good chemistry between Nicholoson and Otis Young as well as young Randy Quaid (very innocent and captivating).Look for Gilda Radner (Saturday Night Live) to appear very quickly in a Nichiren Shoshu scene in New York.And Carol Kane as a young cat house prostitute who beds Mr. Quaid.Great interaction between the actors but the plot falls short. Maybe that's just how the novel was, but was hoping for a bigger dramatic ending."
3,Jack's best,I've never been a big Nicholson fan but this film did give me some hope. Above all else this is a Hal Ashby film and if you enjoy Harold and Maude or Shampoo you should check this out. The plot centers on two Naval officers who draw duty to escort a third to military prison where he will serve eight years for petty theft. The sentence is a harsh punishment for the crime but in the end all characters are trapped and must concede to the rules of their superiors. Ashby does a great job of portaying the imprisonment of all the characters in their roles which may seem particularly difficult in that this is also a road movie.Wonderful.
1,"Horrible fit, do not buy!","This costume is horribly made. I bought this to fit my 6 year old daughter and the mask portion is so big my husband can wear it. The eyes are not cut-out like the picture, instead the were very narrow slits oddly positioned on the face. The face portion is so long it covers my daughters mouth."
1,gamera super monster cinema insomnia version,"this movie is a good movie to own, but not this version, who want's to be interupted by the host, i'll purchsed the elvira double set."
2,SORRY BUT NOT TOO GOOD ON THE QUALITY!,"I bought these as a gift for my son who is a huge fan of Scott Pilgrim. Although he loved them because they resembled Scott Pilgrim's, he can't stand to wear them for more than an hour at a time because they are itchy and just badly made of horrible material! Definitely not like wristbands should feel like."
2,Style Over Function,"I love the style of this watch but if you don't wear it every day it will run down. And wearing it everyday, mine runs a couple minutes fast. And the leather strap is not for a man with a large wrist. You would need to replace the leather band."
3,"Godzilla, North Korean style","Okay, the existing comment completely misses the point of the movie. The film was made in NORTH KOREA under the direct supervision of Kim Jong Il, with part of the production team having been kidnapped at gunpoint from the South and forced to work on pain of death. Pulgasari, the iron-eating rubber-suit monster, is capitalism, who seems at first to side with the workers against the aristocracy but ultimately grows bigger and bigger and more exploitative, demanding more surplus value out of the proletariat... er, scrap iron out of the peasantry. And of course the dialectical class struggle turns to class warfare, and guess who wins. Actually a fairly good synopsis of the class struggle if you ask me.OF COURSE it's an awful movie. It's even awful if you like the camp Godzilla-style blockbusters. Who cares? Any cheesy monster movie made by Kim Jong Il as North Korean propaganda is worth watching."
3,"MORE KOREAN SCIFI........FUN, FUN, FUN","Okay. We all know that Korea is not known for the quality of its films. FIrst, there was, YONGGARRY: Monster from the Deep, which is arguably the worst non-American ... of Godzilla ever made. The film Pulgasari is basically a redo of Daiei's 1966 film Daimajin (which is a film that I recommend) that stars a large bull-man-lizard monster that grows from (do not laugh) a rice doll made by a little girls dying father into an enormous monster by eating iron . Then, as in Daimajin, oppressors become a little too oppressive, Pulgasari destroys a village, oppressors are killed, that's basically the whole movie. The special efx were created by the same team that did the effects for Godzilla 1985 (Teroyushi Nakano, etc) who were obviously on a slightly lower budget for this film."
2,Piano background sounds 'canned'.,"I am not overly picky about my music, but I was disappointed in this CD. The background piano sounded like it was coming from a tin can. Also, some of the songs sounded chopped-off at the end."
5,"Roots of the ""Queen""","It is very known that many soul/R&B female singers have gospel music as their musical roots, and Aretha is not an exception. After the ""Queen of Soul"" became one of the top stars in the music industry in 1960s, she recorded this album with Rev. James Cleveland, who is known as ""King of Gospel Music"". Although she is more famous as a soul singer, this gospel album is still considered as one of her best albums to this day. The 2-CD set includes many famous hymns such as ""Amazing Grace"" and ""What a Friend We Have in Jesus"" as well as Carol King's ""You've Got a Friend"" with a modified lyric combined with Thomas A. Dorsey's ""Precious Lord""."
5,simply outstanding,"This Is aretha at her best.This is when gospel music was music nothing like the music today, you just dont find good down home church like this anymore. I memorized this whole CD when I was 6 yrs old and back then it wasn't a CD it was 8 tracks and cassettes. and now that I am 36 I still remeber every lyric every word that should tell you something. If you want down home church get this CD Aretha will not disappoint youKudos Aretha!!!!!!"
5,Love this album and Aretha!,"When i was little my mother listened to this album all the time. She loved it so much she, my sister and i actually sang lead on a few of the songs in our church choir. I own my mother's original black round album. I had no way to play it (we live in the cd, dvd, blu-ray world now) and who wants to hear those hisses and scratch sounds, not me. So i finally was able to get it from Amazon in cd form when it came back in stock. Love listening and singing along. Brings tears to my eye's and a smile to my face.LOVE YOU MA! R.I.P. Indeed, WHAT A FRIEND WE HAVE IN JESUS!!"
1,Complete garbage,"The unit never worked out of the box... MP3 files played from CD or USB flash drives skipped continually. Pyle replaced the unit with another identical unit with the same identical problem. Pile then replaced the unit with another similar model. This unit also skips MP3s when played from CD. The USB works marginally better, but still encounters issues.Do yourself a favor, be kind to your ears and your wallet... DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM PYLE AUDIO!!!"
3,This product needs some work,This product looks good and has basic features. It is a good deck for people who do not require a lot. The usb port does not work it will not read the mp3 file. The main reason I bought this product was for its usb port.I think I made a bad buy.
1,Wish I kept the receipt!,"Replaced an old Blaupunkt cassette unit with this one mainly because of the USB function. On paper this unit sounds outstanding - MP3 with ID3 tag display, USB input, 200 watts, etc... Unfortunately I have not had much luck in getting the usb port to read any mp3 files from any flash media (have tried 5 different brands now). Of note is that it does recognize the usb media being connected but is unable to recognize the MP3 files on it. Also, the CD mechanism is by far and away the worst I have ever seen - It will skip just sitting in the driveway, not even driving! Completely unsat for a car audio system. Next time I am going to stick with a major brand and spend the extra money.The only good thing to say is that is seems to have good sound quality so if you listen to the radio all the time this unit would be alright."
3,Enticing Book Leaves More To Be Desired,"The book's cover artwork and brief, easy-to-follow narrative in the introductory chapters compelled me to read further, but there was nothing more substantive for me to chew on. Perhaps more elaboration on the personal years would have been more satisfying. Or better yet, the book's title should have been something like ""Numbers & Your Personality."" The chosen title for the book insinuates much more than what the author presents.On the other hand, the book does a wonderful job of providing in-depth interpretations of the personality numbers. There was a sense of completeness in that portion of the book. The first half of the book left me so empty, however, the thought of returning it to the bookstore did cross my mind."
2,Too simple,"As the previous review mentioned, this book is for beginners, and I'm a beginner; however, even for a beginner, this book is too simple and too general."
1,This is a terrible book.,"Why is it that we need to find meaning in things that have no meaning?If we want to call '7' our lucky number and use that to influence how we choose lottery tickets, then that is harmless, but when we start ascribing meaning to, for example, the arbitrary dates of arbitrary months in an arbitrary counting base, then we making a serious mistake.There is no coherent justification of any of the ideas in this book; it should be classed under ficyion - and it would at least then be honest."
4,Good Basic Rock,"Was blown away by this band singing these great songs live in the 90's, and although this studio recording lacks a bit from that in its production (the only reason for a less than perfect rating) the songs are here. Straight forward harmonies, simply stated lyrics, energetic rhythms make this album worth a listen. The band sort of reminds me of a cross between Hootie and the Blowfish and Tom Petty. Some good basic rock here."
3,Actually 3 1/2 stars....,"This particular writer is on par with Simon Clark and James Herbert, two of England's best horror scribes. Taylor is a genius at moving this little story right along. His characters are real and very funny.Taylor weaves a fascinating nightmare about a family that moves into a relative's house. A couple of incidents with neighbor, John Callow, get them off on the wrong start. He comes around to apologize, but strange deaths begin taking place. Its all related to the RUNES!! I will stop here, but the ending is a clincher.Taylor is awesome at keeping u interested. The opera doesn't fascinate me, but he described it very well and wanted me to care. A nice story from a guy who obviously knows it doesn't need to be gory, to be scary!!!"
1,ALSO UNIMPRESSED,"I ordered this for my husband for Xmas and have to agree with the previous review -- there are just a few pages of marine information in the front, and then a lot of lined sheets of paper, then a little ""Guest Registry"" at the end. The product description says it's ""flexible,"" which I guess is a euphemism for ""no added value."""
3,It's Cleo Laine but lacking her former fire. Tracks too long,"Any female singer running up against June Christy/Stan Kenton in 'Sittin' and a-Rockin' and 'Midnight Sun' is facing awesome odds. Cleo loses both times. Cleo can be truly inspired but only once in this CD does she show vestiges of her inherent greatness - ('It Don't Mean a Thing'). Too many instrumental choruses, and the sound mixing is poor - she gets drowned-out quite often. I have been an ardent Cleo fan for 40-some years and this CD was a real let-down."
3,Charmingly Dated,"This is a silly little movie from the time when bared [...] were still shocking in films. Like other nudist exploitation films of this era, it's presented as a coy little promo for the health benefits of nudism, but of course it's really just an excuse to show us some tits. Has a rather lengthy travelog as we anxiously await the part where the three young women get to the nude beach. I must admit that the blurb, which spoke of the director's 'frank portrayal' of nudism, led me to believe that beachballs, towels, and newspapers weren't going to be such essential parts of nudism as in other films of this type. So somewhat disappointing, but a nice bit of nostalgia. The price new is pretty steep, so unless you are into this campy genre of films, buy it used, if at all."
3,Chaos in Halruaa,"The is the middle novel of the Counselors and Kings trilogy. It lacks the zippy pacing combined with funny characterization of the first novel, and the stunning revelations of the last novel. In this novel Halruaan society is undermined and catspaw wars happen. Very chaotic without much resolution.Cunningham spends too much of the book on perspectives of unlikeable characters. Sure, they're smart and twisty, but rather insight into the villains plans I wanted more of what the heroes were doing. It's better than 'meh' if only for the innovative use of a protection amulet. A three and half star novel worth reading for an excellent conclusion in the next book."
1,Could not keep it working,"Within a month of getting this. It stopped working. After dealing with Tech Support, they sent me a second one. It also stopped working after about a month. I tried to convince the woman in India (Kensington customer service) to replace it with a less expensive, wired trackball that worked, and they refused.It was nice while it worked, but but died far too quickly."
2,Very poor motion,"I had a Kensington trackball a while ago and since I am always on the computer, I thought it would be a good idea to get another one. I like the quick launch buttons which save a lot of time when you use the same programs a lot. The scroll button is not in the best place since you have to reach up over the top to get to it. My biggest complaint about this is that the tracking is horrible. My mouse pointer skips around all over the screen which makes it difficult to work with. I tried everything described for this problem at Kensinton support, but it didn't work. I probably would have been much better off with the non-wireless model. I would send it back, but I don't have the box anymore."
2,Poor tracking,"I have experienced the ""skipping"" with the cursor on both units I have owned. Customer support was very helpful and they sent me a new unit. Unfortunately it also had the same problem.I would save some money and purchase the wired version."
4,"Comfortable and function, but rough around the edges","I've used Logitech trackballs for years, but this is the first Kensington I've owned. I absolutely love idea of this trackball, but there are a few things that are rather irksome. Primarily, the jog wheel is inconvient and hard to use. Similarly, the programmable buttons are a bit stiff, and the motion of the trackball is a a bit rough. Over all, I'm satisfied with this purchase, but only time will tell if it was worth upgrading to from my almost perfect Logitech TrackMan Marble FX."
4,"Beautiful, Just what I Wanted...but a bit dull after a few listens...but it's for baby, not me...","Nicely arranged instrumentals, perfect for the nursery! I could do without the synthesizer in a couple of the songs though, I prefer the acoustic sounds."
3,Cool,"Criative and very well played. The problem is that hawaian music is quite previsible and the band didn't went out of traditional hawaian music. So: after the 4th song it seems you've heard the hole cd already..For JJ fans is a good purchase cause is different, unique and from JJ. Good to listen when going to bed or at the beach."
5,Pure Magic...,"This album is by far my favorite Pink Floyd release. Each track is a kind of magic that words cannot describe. Have a Cigar, Shine On You Crazy Diamonds, Wish You Were Here, Welcome to the Machine. Each track really conveys the magic that Pink Floyd experienced during this time, perhaps even more than DSoTM.If you're new to Pink Floyd, this album and DSotM should be a must buy. They're on iTunes and the Amazon MP3 store as well, if you disdain physical media. But, as with the music, there's something magic about owning the physical product in your cupboard. I highly recommend this album, perhaps just as much as Abbey Road and the White Album by the Beatles. These albums will go down as some of the best humankind has ever produced."
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent book, it discusses the origins of christianity before christ. John G.Jackson like Dr.Clarke are from the same error, there work is very precise and to the point."
2,Not impressed,This book makes so many references to Folklore in the Old Testament by Frazer that you would be better suited just reading that.
5,This is to Arthur. You're a complete imbecile.,"Mr. Jackson is a well-educated man. I find his book to be strikingly on point and backed by credible evidence. Yet, some people ""Arthur"" tend to deny anything that has its roots seeded deeply into the Egyptian Religion. I must state that to understand the Egyptian Religion you must learn that: ""The Egyptian Religion was a pure Monotheism manifested externally by symbolic Polytheism"". The Bible even contains this understanding when Jesus says in Psalm 82 verse 6: ""I have said,Ye (you) are gods, and all of you are children of the most high"".This is a direct quote. So, according to the bible the manifestation is with us."
2,An Incomplete Presentation of the Facts,"Many differences between Christianity and the religions that the author has studied are not mentioned in this book, and even further, some of the religious accounts that the author talks about are disputed.For example, take the Krishna-Christ comparison. Here, the author fails to note that Krishna was never worshipped alone; in fact, his female counterpart Radha is often worshipped with, and even before him. This is a huge difference in relation to Chist's story. In addition to this, the Krishna story that is used, including possible cruxifiction, is not widely accepted. The more widely known version is that Krishna died when an arrow pierced his foot, similarly to the later Greek legend of Achilles.This is just a small drop of a pool of other similar examples.In other words, read with reservation."
5,A must have for any serious musician.,"This is a fantastic book, and an important book for musicians suffering from overuse injuries. I am an injured musician, and have been in ""recovery"" for over a year now. I wish I'd found out about this book before I was ever injured. It not only acts as an aid in recovery, but also as a preventative means. It is easy to read, well-organized, and not only provides accurate and extremely helpful information, but also provides information on other relevant and useful resources. I have been telling my family and friends about it. And anyone I meet in the future who suffers from these kinds of injuries, I will be sure to point them in the direction of this book. A must have for any serious musician."
1,Wrong recording dealt with in the other reviews,"Heaven knows what Amazon playing at. The three five star reviews posted here are all for a different recording, that by Peter Serkin, which does indeed merit 5 stars, but this recording has Mélisande Chauveau as the pianist, is poorly played and just as poorly recorded. I bought my copy in a charity shop for very little, so at least my money went to a good cause."
2,Just ok,"These are attractive, but a bit stiff for easy use. Probably wouldn't have cosen if I had known."
4,Rule Number Five: Get Out Like A Spent Knob,"4.5 starsWow, this one really took me by surprise. Found it at me local library and brought it back to the flat for a quick look-see. Who's to know it would have one of the funnniest lead turns since Gervais' classic David Brent?Timothy Spall takes a great script and ratchets it up a notch. No holds barred and then some, his salesman is both riotously funny and sadly disturbing. But mostly funny! There's not a dull moment here, and the 75 minutes fly right by, goosed by Boyle's slam-bang montage vision.It's not bloody simple to make something that's both horrifying and touching, but 'ere 'tis. The horrification comes from the unblinking portraits of England and the ugly reality of salesmanship; the tenderness comes from unexpected moments of real caring amidst the surreal hilarity.If you like British humor at all, this is some of the sweetest black comedy you could ask for. Well worth your time. He'll even knock off a hundred quid for ya."
5,Very cool.,"A very different show when you think about their live gigs back when they first exploded into the scene.The second night looked like a much more interesting and better performance, maybe that one should of been put on in favour instead of this one. Apparently Liam was wasted though.Nevermind.On the second night, Noel kicks a football into the crowd and its a bad shot.""Thats why I play guitar"" he says."
3,Where's Helter Skelter?,"Nothing new from Oasis, There and Then is way better than this dvd. If you are a hardcore oasis fan, you should get this if not don't bother. The best performance from this show was not included , does anybody know why?"
1,Mad Fer It,"For any Oasis fan, this DVD is top! Especially for the fans that have been waiting since November for the DVD to turn into a Region 1 disk. The Gig is awesome, however There and Then could possibly be more hype. Anyway, for an oasis fan or music fan who wants to know how oasis has been in the last year, well this DVD is for you.Awesome gig and special features! cheers"
2,Really Awful!!!,"If you thought ""BE HERE NOW"" was their drugged up period, take a look at this, its terrible.""Standing On The Shoulder of Giants"" songs just don't cut it with their best tunes and Liam sounds awful.The guitars are pink and wacky at timed, Noels ones, and the wacky and abstract visuals just don't really make it look like the real Oasis, which is a shame."".....THERE AND THEN"" beats this by miles, straight forward rock n roll played on guitars.A very bad time for Oasis."
1,"Awful, smack in the middle of a very bad time of Oasis.","Oasis Live at Wembley 2000 -Oasis live at wembley 2000 is a awful show, its was smack bang in the middle of a rather awful time for the band.They realeased an awful album named ""Standing on the shoulder of gaints"" an experimental album, that was'nt very rock n roll at all.Neither is this performance, Liam sounds awful, image wise the band looks terrible, and Noels revoulting joke and colourful and flaming abstract visuals plague the screen and big screen behind the stage.Combined with a very untidy setlist from the dog ear of an album named ""Standing on the shoulder of giants"" it does'nt show Oasis as they really are today Live and how they were.Get ""...THERE AND THEN"" to experience the real Oasis."
4,"Great to have, even if you already own the CD","Now, maybe I'm a bit biased since Oasis is my favorite band ever, but I really am glad I bought this DVD. The image quality is quite good, and it's fun to have the bits of in-between-song banter that are cut from the CD. As far as the bonus features go, they're a bit minimal-- and to be honest, the crowd shots are a little silly at times -- but the interview portion is a good bonus, especially with Noel talking about his thoughts on the albums they'd released at that point. I don't think you have to be a super-fan to enjoy this."
5,THE BEST,Let's make it short... this is the best CD/DVD that I've ever had.... The Greatest Oasis Hits alive!!! You don't want to miss it AT ALL.
3,"Boring, and horrendous audio","The song choices were poor - ""There and Then"" was SIGNIFICANTLY better. And the audio on this DVD was very bad and muddy, probably because it is offered as ""5.0,"" whatever that is supposed to mean."
5,Oasis - Familiar To Millions - The Perfect Review,"There can be 2 reviews, one for the fans and one for normal people. This DVD is excellent, but if you arent a fan, sorry, it's probably that you arent going to enjoy this DVD. I only have to say that this DVD is EXCELLENT, if you have any doubts see the technicals details on the top of the page.My RATE: 5 STARS"
2,What's wrong with the audio?,I just got this DVD today and am totally disappointed with the audio. It's incredibly muddy 5.0 with very little high end. It's intolerable. What's up? There has to be a flaw in this DVD or my setup.
5,i haven't taken it out of my car cd player!,this is the best stuff i have gotten in recent times. the music is soooo hooky!
2,You get what you pay for,"My last car stereo, a Sony AM/FM/CD with removable face, was nice. I became lazy about removing the face at night and a moment of carelessness -- leaving the driver's door open overnight -- made it easy for a burglar to steal the stereo. I decided to replace it with this cheapy so as to save money and discourage future theft. My expectations were low but was surprised to find that the product registered engine noise, so I needed a $30 filter; the receiver is really weak and only gets the high-powered FM stations, not my favorite public stations, and it drifts. It also has no clock which is unusual for a car stereo. But the tape player works well and sounds good. All in all, this $20 car stereo cost me over $130 installed including product, shipping and parts. This is a lesson I won't forget."
5,Great Music,"Great Music, but you don't have to pay collector's prices. See Tim Flannery dot com to order Ring Around the Sun, Kentucky Towns, Highway Songs or Pieces of the Past."
3,Its OK not great,It was ok a bit basic you can tell there was a small budget not what I thought it was going to be. I was thinking standing in the middle of the field directing your dog from afar which it didn't provide for me. However it does have some good points about training
2,A little pricey,"Overall the DVD gave some good training ideas but it was very short. It could have been expanded maybe how to make the gates they used for the training, or how to extend the distance as this is what the DVD was about ""Control at a Distance"". I got this as a gift but I'm not sure it was worth the $35"
1,I just wasted $1.95,I am seldom as dissapointed as I was after this purchase. The 'book' consists of 4 pages. Of these 4 pages 1 is used up as the cover page and the last page contains frgament of a short paragraph. In essence you buy 2 pages of a less then mediocre D-grade Undergraduate term paper. This is at best a tabloid-style editorial without any source references. This was not a good first experience of an electronic book purchase.
1,THIS IS HORRIBLE! I CANT RATE IT A LOW ENOUGH AMMOUNT OF STARS!,"This is in no way a ""Tribute to Led Zeppelin"". This album falls greatly short of Zeppelins legendary music. I don't even think the previous comment from rockpig WV ""rockpig"" was even.... I dont even know what it was... he/she seems to have no idea how they feel about Led Zeppelin and their music because of a couple quotes... ""some of Led Zeppelin's best songs works on every level. Should be very enjoyable to both young and old, fans of the best classic rock"" ""some tight men and women doing a great job of modernizing these old hacks."" This guy clearly does not have his mind made up about Zeppelin.I will finish off by telling you FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS HOLY DO NOT BUY OR LISTEN TO THIS ""interpretation"" OF LED ZEPPELIN! YOU WILL BE GREATLY DISSAPOINTED AND FEEL A DEEP PAIN IN YOUR HEAD! This hip hop album has completely butchered some of their finest songs."
5,Beautiful and a great deal,"I own a Tag watch and a diamond Movado watch but wanted a beautiful and expensive looking watch for everyday. This watch exceeded my expectations. It is a substantial piece but is also very feminine with the diamond bezel and pale pink face. Bulova makes a quality watch and the price is over $100 less than the ""sale"" price at my local department store."
1,Overpriced and poor quality.,"I could have gotten a Swiss Gear bag for half the price of this item, but I wanted the best quality. Within one month the lining was unraveling and it got to the point where it was so bad I just cut out the protectiver interior lining with scissors. Save your money and go with Swiss Gear."
3,"Nice idea, but could be better material and design","Great idea in principal, avoiding messy to clean, space eating potty chairs.Plastic material is more lightweight and flexible than I would like and it does not quite fit flush on our Mansfield elongated toilet, causing it to flex and trap small (and big!) fingers when you sit down on it. Also one handed operation is not possible since the two seat layers tend to stick together at the hinge point and lift or drop together like the pages of a cheap book. Difficult for the ""child on the other arm maneuver"" or the easily startled toddler who gets a ""seat in the face"" when lifting the lid.My 20 month olds find the step up a little tall and a little narrow for confident self positioning, and the boy bits bump at the front is too bulky for my little girls to get over comfortably. I think the whole set up will work better for a more in dependant older toilet user who just does not want to fall in to an adult sized toilet."
2,Adult Seat Lacks Comfort,"The opening in the adult seat is larger than that of the ceramic, elongated seat that came with our toilet. It also has hard square edges vs. the curved/contoured edges of our ceramic seat. Furthermore, the ""guard"" on the child's potty seat does still jab you in the back if you sit back against it.I would consider the attachable flip potty seats instead for about half the price of this seat.The step stool is fine if you're looking for a plastic stool."
5,This was a gift,"I didn't get to taste any of these, but the reaction of the lady I gave them to would lead me to believe they were exceptional. I'll have to see about getting some for myself next."
1,the unseen should remain unseen,this story of a mutant man hunting and killing a group of women who are guest in the house where the man lives. this is just unwatchable and a complete waste of time.
1,And it should stay that way,Man this slasher/monster movie is just the pits. not very well made and the plot was old when it was made. A waste of time!!!!!
3,"A few songs short of ""Greatest"".","When putting together a hits collection from somebody with only two big albums out, key songs should NOT be missing. I mean c'mon. Sure this has ""Juicy"" and ""Big Poppa"", and even ""One More Chance"" and ""Notorious Thugs"". BUT you can't argue that ""Mo Money, Mo Problems"" should be here. That was the first B.I.G. track alot of people ever heard. Also where's ""I Love The Dough"" and ""Sky's The Limit""? Two of the catchiest songs on Life After Death. I even think ending this with Puff's ""I'll Be Missing You"" would have been a nice touch. Hidden track maybe. Still there's some classic tracks here, and overall good for the new fan. Let me be the 100th person to say just get Ready To Die and Life After Death."
3,"tight,but incomplete","I've always Dug Biggie. he was One of the Best Story-tellers ever in his all but Brief Career. now of course I dig all the Hits. ""F****** you Tonight"" with R.Kelly is a Classic Love Song. we don't hear much of those anymore. that was my cut 10 years ago. it cracked me up,but it was direct&to the Point. Ten Crack Commandements was also the cut. ""One more Chance""/Stay with Me"" a very strong usage of the Debarge Song'Stay with Me"" is used very nicely here. that Debarge Song was also used for BlackStreet,Ashanti&also for 2Pac's ""I ain't mad at'cha"". Biggie had Humor& way of breaking things down. there should have been a few more tracks,but basically if you have his first two albums then you have 99% of all you need.Puffy needs to stop milking the Brother&let Him Rest in Peace."
2,if you have the first two albums don't waste your money,"Biggie was pretty dope for the short time period that he graced the mic. But he doesn't have an extensive catalog like PAC to be able to make a greatest hits CD. Half the songs are from Life after death and the the other half are from ready to die with a few singles mixed in. So if you own the first two albums (which is about 95% of the world population that do own them) you will be wasting your money. In this day in age with technology, I could probably put together a better greatest hits disc of BIG at home if I wanted the songs on one disc. The cd is a marketing ploy for Puffy and is a complete waste of money for most of the consumers in the world."
3,Greatest Hits???,"Trust me when I say that this is not a real greatest hits from Biggie because it is missing quite a few jewels. This album looks like it was slapped together with a team that just sat down and thought ""oh yeah that one was a hit single, I remember that one"" instead of actually doing research on all of his hits. It does have most of his hits, but not all of them or songs from soundtracks and ""B-Sides"". Don't buy this cd if you already have biggies cd's wich you should already have!"
3,One of the greatest rappers ever...but cd is missing a few things,"I have been a fan of Biggie Smalls for as long as I can remember. This cd does capture most of his the hits that people enjoyed before his death and the singles that came out after his death. This compilation is great. Don't get me wrong on that. But where are his other hits...Another...Sky's The Limit...Mo Money Mo Problems...Going Back To Cali. And another song that would have made it even better is Me and My Bitch (Live) from ""The Show"" soundtrack."
4,"Great cd, but not really his best.","I'll keep it short and sweet, this cd in a good mix of his good stuff but only a couple of tracks are really his best."
5,Biggie's hits,"this artist has made something few others have.released 3 cds his entire career, which is ok but all the cds were great. sure, i didnt like few songs (like 3). so this album has no bad songs but only Greatest hits.i would buy it if i didnt heard all of biggie already. so if you havent heard all of biggie already but it!"
3,I love Biggie but I am tired of this best there ever was,"As stated I love ready to die second album was some Puffy trash. Back on topic because of his lack of material and sophmore jinx I cant put him in the 10. People like LL CoolJ, KRS one, Rakim, Busy Bee,Kool Moe Dee, I mean the list goes on of dudes with track records. This album of mainly ready to die plus othersub-par hits is an embarassment to his talent and capped potential."
3,"So-so, but worth a listen","This has a few songs I really like and some I had never heard of. I wouldn't really say it's ALL of Biggie's hits, but it's definitely worth checking out."
1,Puff what the hell are you thinking?,This Cd is terrible. if you want to hear the Notorious B.I.G then buy his original albums and enjoy. I hate when labels and owners like Puffy deface a mans legacy by releasing albums just like this to make money becuz they think people want to hear the same songs on his first two and only albums. Puffy is bad for the industry and this release proves it. Let the man rest in peace and stop putting out more Cd's.
3,Greatest Hits -Import from Australia,"The cost for buying this CD turned out to be quite expensive as it was an import, approx $41.00. However I could have got a local version of the same for less than $18. There were no add-on singles for the import version. So guys please look around."
3,"Good trailer, but poor dump cart","I've had the trailer one year, and it will handle anything I load on it. The dumping lever tends to be difficult (unloading and locking back down). The tailgate must be removed (by pulling straight up) to dump trailer, making it very hard to use both dump mechanism and tailgate together. Last issue for improvement would be the trailer hook up, it is a bit flimsy & a ball hitch would be a great improvement. But for hauling fairly heavy loads in confined areas - works very well."
2,Unstable,"When I first got my Wireless Turbo mouse, I found the transparent blue ball to be a little sticky, so I dropped the putty-colored ball from my old ADB turbomouse into this new one and found it to be smoother . OK. But then my first Wireless Turbo Mouse sucked batteries; I had to change them about once a week. Kensington replaced it, and now I've been using the replacement for about a year and I'm finding that the cursor jumps randomly all over the screen. New batteries helped a little but I can be working and suddenly the cursor will jump to the other side of the screen-or if I'm word-processing, the cursor will just start drifting uncontrollably down the line. It's disastrous in Photoshop. I'm going back to usb. And I'll probably buy a Kensington Turbo Mouse."
2,"Not Van Morrison, Nor Country Music","With all due respect to the musicians and the rest of folks that made possible this work, I reckon this is a bad album. I don't know if Mr. Van Morrison got IT during the sessions, but he certainly didn't get me. The album is as far away from real country music as Dublin is from Nashville, honestly. He seems to be cross at the lyrics, instead of really feelin' them, and the string section is well executed, but real bad placed; there shouldn't have been any in the first place. If you ain't heard any of Van Morrison's albums, please don't start here, you oughtta check outMoondanceorTupelo Honey (Exp). If you ain't heard any country music, please don't start here either: go to Hank Williams or Waylon Jennings, for instance. Whatever the case is, it'll give you a bad idea of both."
1,Gimme A Break Van,"It's [...] like this that causes me to forget what a great musician that Van Morrison once was. His tired, mumbling, versions of these classics offer nothing new to the mix. Bad Karioke is more like it. Sorry Rich, there is nothing at all ""compelling"" about this sad attempt by Van to jump on some sort of ""country"" bandwagon. It's embarrassing to say the least."
1,Wrong Genre,"Sorry to disagree with some of the other reviews, but pain and simple, this is a horrible CD. His voice was not made for country, and yes I do like country. I was horribly disapointed in this effort. Not one good song in the lot;"
1,Not the Morrison I know and love,"I was excited to hear Morrison's new CD as I am a huge fan of his music. I could not believe my ears. I gave it a few listens, thinking it was new and different and I wanted to be fair. Alas, I found the album to be boring and mundane. I hope that he has gotten ""country"" out of his system and gets back to doing it his way again. Sorry - it was a total disappointment."
1,Toooo country,"Van has done many great songs in his many years of recording, but he missed the boat on this one. Sure there are some great songs here and his voice sounds good, but the problem is he did not do anything to these songs to make them his own. I know there are a lot of covers here but a touch of bluegrass, some horns, a little slide guitar, just something to add a personal touch to the songs. Dolly Parton pulled it off with ""The Grass Is Blue"" Leon Russell did with ""Hank Wilson's Back"" but Van just missed it I am sorry to say."
1,snore,"I'm sure it was fun for Van to record a bunch of songs he likes, but overall this would have made for a disappointing bootleg. Thanks for all the great music through The Healing Game. All good times have to come to an end."
2,Vandalized,"Sorry Van, you wasted my hope and my money. I was banking on your raw quality and mellow empathy to these classic western tunes, you didn't deleiver. I'll keep the CD to be a part of my collection, but it won't be played again and it may be more valuable as a rare, limited edition than a prized Van Morrison effort. The Devil's been paid."
2,"Um.....huh, flat soda?","I have all of Van's albums except this one. He's just not on top with it. I've listened to it because I love his voice, but the country thing should've ended with the rockabilly co-effort he did with Linda Gail Lewis. The songs remind me of flat soda. Sorry Van. No crests, all valley."
3,marking time,"When Van Morrison is on his game-Astral Weeks, Moondance, Into the Music, Tupelo Honey etc. he's as good as it gets. When he misses, (A Period of Transition, Avalon Sunset) there are moments of brilliance, but the record never seems to come together. Pay the Devil has moments that are quite good (Your Cheatin' Heart, Big Blue Diamonds, Half as Much, What Am I Living For) but far too many misses. IMHO he misses badly in his interpretation of Rodney Crowell's Till I Gain Control Again.Van Morrison has earned the right to record whatever he wants to and I'll listen respectfully. This was a good idea that he didn't quite pull off.There's enough good music to justify owning the record, but it's unlikely it will stay in the changer for weeks."
4,You gotta love traditional country done right,"Unlike the mean minded review of the person from Austrailia who thought he should shoot everyone who recorded music 15 to 20 yrs ago, I thought this was a very good CD, I have always thought music reviews were intented to be objective about the music not about one persons obvious contempt for artists that may have seen better days in his view, but then that person probably doesnt understand north american music all that well so we have to make allowances for ignorance.Great job Van"
4,One Super Song Gains 4 Stars for the Whole Deal,"By and large, most reviewers have gotten it right. Van hasn't produced a real stunner of an album for awhile--and Pay the Devil continues that trend. Although Van's had some fine recordings in the last 15 years, the last that made me cry 'cause it was so good allll the way through was probably Night in San Francisco. We devotees must be satisfied with a few great numbers each time out and settle for the rest because even when not up to our hopes, he's so great! Personally, he deserves to have me buy each CD.The great consolation is that those ""few great numbers"" are worth it; that is, worth the wait for the CD and worth the price. On Pay the Devil, that great number is Van's take on ""Till I Gain Control Again."" It makes this album worthy of attention and support."
3,"A Decent Album, No Masterpiece.","Very listenable, solid ode to C&W; tunes of the late 50s/early 60s. Catchy, even bouncy at times. We shouldn't expect an album of covers, even done as well as this, to reach the level of someone's best. Doesn't seem fair.For Van fans who enjoy his experiments, you'll love it. For anyone who insists his best work came much earlier, you probably won't like the results. I did.- Razr"
4,Van Nails It!,"I love this album and disagree with reviewers who say Van doesn'town the songs. His well-worn voice and Celtic soul make each selectionuniquely his. Makes me think of a picker sitting in a back room,a bottle of ale close by, singing his heart out."
2,Never seems to take ownership of the songs,"A key reason I have liked so much of Van Morrison's body of work is his ability to own a song, whether his or someone else's. And Mr. Morrison is entitled to record in whatever genre suits his fancy.So the problem I have with this set of tunes is that he never seems to take ownership of the songs; I tend to hear many of the tracks with their earlier, original vocals and can never quite suspend my impression that these covers are neither an improvement or viable re-creation.There is plenty of sharp musicianship in evidence but not enough of the heart and soul I have come to expect from a Van Morrison album."
5,Another example of Van's mastery of song,"I have been a Van Morrison fan since 1968. I was turned on to Moondance in Vietnam and listened to it almost exclusively for my whole tour. My only disappointment with Van is that he will not play in the US often enough for me to see him live.OK, I am biased, I love just about everything he does and this is pretty special.If you liked the country side of Van with Linda Gale, you will like this also."
5,pay the greatest popular male voice,"the remake of what i am living for? and till i gain control again are now two van masterpiece. very,very emotional, wonderfull songs.the performance of van is fantastic.the others tracks are very good."
2,Minor league Morrison,"Nobody is going to be pulling this off the shelf for a listen in ten years, unlike ""Astral Weeks"" or ""Veedon Fleece"" or even some of the late-period music made by Van Morrison. This is unforced music, to be sure, but also seemingly uninspired. Relaxed to the point of barely seeming involved, this is a toss-off effort. Are the days of Morrison Magic gone for good? Maybe so. Efforts like this one, while not diminishing the stature of this master performer, do nothing to enhance it either."
5,It's great!,"One of the best country albums of all time! I hope Van comes out with another. This is real country, not the bubble gum stuff you hear on the radio for the last 10 years or so."
3,Does what it's supposed to do but could be more sturdy,"I have three large shepherds and now three large wire kennels. When our youngest pup was ready for a large kennel we found this one on line. The price was good and it shipped for free. The kennel was as advertised. I don't really have any complaints, so far it has done the job. It just doesn't seem as sturdy as our ""other brand"" kennels. The door seems a little flimsy. It was easy to set up and directions for set up were well written. I think it's a good kennel for the money but if you have a little more funds I'd spring for another, more sturdier brand"
4,VERY GOOD TEXTBOOK,It's amazing how the authors can join a resumed textbook and at the same time very complete .Fantastic illustrations. Diferencial diagnosis are the superb. I really reccomend the acquisition of this book.
1,CANT STAND UP - LIES,Thanks to fake reviews and people using keywords like 'stand up' I made the $300+ mistake of ordering this for stand up use. Unless you are a midget or are willing to slouch over and destroy your back it's not tall enough to stand up with - it only goes about an inch higher than your average desk. It's almost a cool product if only it were about 15 inches higher.
4,HP DVD-R DISK,"The HP DVD-R 8X disks work very good on my DVR writer. However, I did not keep the ones I ordered from AMAZON because their 50 pack cost a few cents more that what the 100 pack cost at Micro Center. plus tax. When I ordered it I saw the picture of the 100 case package, so I thought I would get the 100 pack for the $30.00. The 100 pack cost $27.00 here at micro center puls 6.75% tax make it $29 and some change. But they are very hard to come by. I think maybe PH stop making 8X, However I found ouy that the higher ones like 16X and 32X work just as good or even better. It just can't use anything under 8X.But the HP brand works very well for my Writer."
4,good bag... could be a little bigger though !,"this is a good bag for the price!. It has lots of nifty spaces to keep your office stuff. But if you have a 15"" laptop then you may have to remove or shift around some of the padding!but overall its a good decent quality bag and hence I give it 4 stars !regards,Sumit."
4,Nice one!!!,It is an amazing bag for the price. Everything is perfect but one would struggle to fit a book with the laptop. I was looking for a bag where I could even fit a book which is not the case. But I can not actually complain as it is very cheap.
5,Kensington Notebook Carrying Case,"This is the perfect carry case for any Laptop. I bought it for my wifes brand new Dell Inspiron 6000. It provides the utmost rpotection for any laptop pc, and is very stylish. You can alos store folders, pens, and other neccesary office supplies as well. For the price I paid $29, it was a steal. The best deal I've seen on the internet thus far."
4,Lucky Day,"There is an album titled ""Lucky Day"" by Jonathan Edwardswhich includes most or all of the songs on this album butare live versions. Lucky Day was the first Jonathan Edwardsalbum I bought so I enjoy these live versions much better.The tempo is faster and Jonathan adds his embelishmentswithin songs. I would like to see some recording companyreproduce Lucky Day on CD.Jonathan Edwards fans that haven't heard it will enjoy ~~~"
5,Great tunes !,"I remember the song Shanty from the 70's , finally put the singer together with the tune, and the rest of the album is great, too ! I don't think anyone will be disappointed."
4,bought for one song & liked the album,"Sunshine-his big hit, of course. Some nice folk music and a little country. I'm not big on country, but the rest of the album is a nice retreat. I think his music has fallen into obscurity."
4,"Good Performers, Good Songs","If you really like Sondheim music and like the songs on this collection, buy A Sondhiem Collection, the three disc set. All of the songs are on that set as well. However, there are a few lines and introductions that are on this CD and not the other. This one has great performers, Liz Callaway, Georger Hearn, Angela Landsbury, Bob Gunton. Sondheim accompanied Ms. Landsbury in one of his most famous songs from A Little Night Music, ""Send in the Clowns."""
5,"Great Book, Even if you Disagree","What conservatives and liberals are categorically guilty of is not reading literature that doesn't agree with their political opinions, that doesn't get mentioned in their political circles, in short; that isn't politically 'hip' to read. I wish more conservatives would read this book and ones like it, I for one actually read the literature of their movement. This book is especially good for young students who wish to have a companion document to their biased history textbooks."
5,What schools don't tell ya in History class!!,"Have you ever wondered or questioned our country's foreign policy? Then this shocking, factual book is definitely for you. I definitely recommend that you buy it. Very informative and the author has done his tedious homework on factual information(many declassified). Do not let the 400+ pages fool ya. There are no more than 10 pages per country and it is easy to take a break if need be.( I finished the book in only a few days) An oustounding altenative to our history books!"
4,Good,"I liked The Spanish Guitar DVD concert, talking about cost benefit, I will say it is a good deal. You can sit, watch it, relax and enjoy each one of the songs and music videos contained in the DVD. You will be transported to the different places shown in this material. Comparing this DVD with the Nights of Fire I liked better the last one."
3,Same old,"Arguably Benise is one of the must talented guitarist in the scene today. However, when compared to his previous DVDs this new release is predictable, not very creative, and a bit indulgent."
2,My mother-in-laws vision of things Spanish.,"Very pleasant artist, but is to Spanish music like Taco Bell is to Mexican Cuisine. Pleasant entertainment, in the way that a Hostess Cupcake is desert. Does the trick if you're not too demanding."
4,it is what it is....,"The content wasnt quite what I expected, but the book itself is very attractive and a good coffee table book.....its a book of spells and incantations."
5,Book of the Dead,"Decent book, the pictures are very helpful. Definitely a must for beginners on this topic."
5,Mother Earth News,My all time favorite magazine! I keep everyone and refer back to it. I would love to get all the CD's one day. Worth every penny. You cannot go wrong!
4,Great-informative-interesting magazine. I ordered as a gift for a freind. She loved the magazine!,I have enjoyed this magazine for years. It is informative-interesting-helpful magazine. I ordered this subscription for a friend. She loved it!
2,Recycled ideas over and over,"This magazine is not written for a homesteader, gardener or farmer. It's written for people with more money than sense who feel like they ""could"" do any of the above. Mostly I'm distressed by the complete lack of knowledge on the part of their writers. I'm hoping it's that, the only other reason you'd deliberately spread false information would be pretty malicious.Overall a pass if you're looking for anything other than entertainment. Their ""reviews"" always heavily favor their higher end advertisers, the actual articles are pretty hit or miss when it comes to actual information, and their inability to figure out how to use a scale makes most of their recipes a crapshoot.Wouldn't buy and I'd wish people wouldn't assume it's a great magazine for those involved in homesteading/gardening/etc."
4,"""lost its compost"" for a while but slowly getting back to nature","Somehow, the Mother became more like something else... Sunset? I dunno, but it really lost its way from the down-to-earth, get-down-in-the-dirt, raise-chickens-in-your-backyard-&-fertilize-with-the-rest viewpoint.I miss the newsprint, non-glossy paper, the substantive articles for people who really are living off the land, not cruising over it in SUV's and entertaining themselves with dreams of organic lavender.That said, it seems to be coming around the corner to its old self again, but it's a long, slow, return I think. I am heartened by the direction it is taking, and subscribe once more to hope it'll keep going that way. I mean, just the glossy paper alone makes it suspect amongst my crew! I'll hide it when the purists come, and hope it keeps getting back to the Earth."
4,Love it but...,Love the down-home thinking with a modern twist. I didn't rate it a 5 star because it doesn't come 12 months. Some of the suggestions are also hard to do for those of us who work and have children and live in the city. Many articles are pertinent and do-able for city dwellers.
5,Mother Earth News,"This is the most comprehensive source of information on living in a self sufficient manner. They have a wonderful website as well that is chalked full of information. Mother Earth News is great for the experienced homesteader, or a younger person that would like to follow in their parents footsteps. Do not let this one get away. It is a great reminder of the simpler things in life. This should be a companion of yours."
5,I will subscribe for many may years!,"This magazine is amazing. There is so much information on every page. I am new to organics, kind of, so I am still learning about everything. This magazine is great to have for reference and before you buy a house read it so you don't spend thousands on a regular house when you could build it so much cheaper with alternative methods- that are much prettier too."
2,Not like it used to be...,"As a kid my grandfather always had this magazine and we loved reading it. Now it has only 1 or 2 ""real articles"" worth looking at and not the magazine it used to be at all. I was expecting hands on self sustaining living and old world style ""how to"" info. I feel like I'm reading a magazine written by city yuppies geared toward them. Not for those of us living in rural areas all our lives."
3,City dweller,A lot of good information for those who have access to sunny land. Need more info on vegetable growing for city dwellers with some trees in and on surrounding property. Like controlling squirrels and bag worms on pecan trees and peach tree infestations. Or maybe I just need to read more effectfully.
4,has alot of interesting articals,"I have got the magazine I ordered, but the ones I have bought at the news stand I have enjoyed. This is why I subscribed to it."
2,Where is the Kindle Subscription?,"I have been reading this magazine for years and love it. I just don't understand why its not availabe for the Kindle yet.One of the reasons I purchased my Kindle Fire was so I could get all of my favorite magazines without wasting so much paper through print subscriptions.That being said, I find it incredibly hypocritical that a magazine like Mother Earth News that promotes sustainability and green living does not yet have an electronic version available.Disappointing!"
2,Former Fan,"I subscribed to this magazine for 2 years but have decided not to renew because of the editorial view that human beings are destroying the earth and the solution to the world's problems is to have fewer people. For many of us getting back to basics- growing our own food, living simply and eschewing a consumer lifestyle this is an offensive slap in the face. We have 8 children and I would guess that the majority of the people interested in simple living have all the children that God wants them to have. We see children as a blessing. When you examine the most successful homesteaders you are talking about subcultures like the Amish- who understand that children are not the problem. It is an interesting paradigm- the agrarian lifestyle with 2 or fewer children. It simply isn't feasible."
1,Not in Kindle,I want to know why there are not more farming types of magazines available for Kindle? Why are we not able to send a msg to the editor telling them we would like it in Kindle format like you can with the books?
4,Great magazine overall,"As I've enjoyed living-off-the-land kinds of stuff since I was a teenager, this magazine was an amazing find in my early 20s only to find out my mother had been reading it for years! Their articles are interesting, inspiring, and encouraging. I think a lot of their ideas are very do-able, although some are difficult if you don't have the land. The only negative thing I'd have to say about it is that some of their issues/articles seem a little redundant. Overall, though, I enjoy reading these issues, some of them over and over. They really appeal to the earth roots personality."
3,"Good magazine, but too political","A good magazine, but I get a little to tired of the political bias portrayed in the articles. I want to read about how to raise vegetable and animals and create a homestead. I do not want views that try to make me feel guilty for breathing too much and not driving a hybrid car. Ogden Publications also makes GRIT Magazine which is more exclusive rural living (and actually uses a lot of the same Mother Earth articles on gardening and farming), but without all of the global doom & gloom and global warming fluff. Hobby Farms is another excellent magazine which I prefer to both Mother Earth and GRIT. I plan on canceling the Mother Earth and keeping GRIT because there is really no viable reason to keep both."
4,A Fountain of Knowledge,"I bought this subscription for my husband who enjoys gardening (we have fruit trees, 12 square foot gardens, and two large vegetable beds).This magazine is so much more than gardening advice. You get information about how to live a more green life: from using solar power to dehydrate food to vermiculture (using worms to compost).We have saved all of our issues so we can refer back to them and I've happily renewed the subscription for another year.I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn more about green living and ways to more naturally garden."
1,Don't buy this!!!,"The lock is hard to use, when you try to set the combination the numbers are very loose and the move around while you are trying to lock/unlock it. I had mine for about 3 months and it broke, so my laptop was stuck and it couldn't move it :-("
5,Perfect!,"Well... it's a lock! Works like it should: I guess that laptop theft must be a thing of the past where I live because I couldn't find this in any local brick and mortar stores. But, Amazon had it and it got delivered to me directly. You have to wonder why physical shopping is down but Net shopping is up????"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"I bought this lock to use while on business in Grand Cayman. I live in Chicago, so the travel time was pretty long.I have a brand new Sony Vaio that I was going to use on the job and I decided to get a lock to prevent theft.The directions were hard to understand and it was nearly impossible to set a new combination. When I finally managed to change it, I put the lock on attached to my work table.The work day went by fine. I was thankful for the lock even though there wasn't really any worry of theft with the company I was working for. At the end of the day, I went to unlock the combination and it had ""Forgotten"" my combination.After an hour of trying every combination starting from 000, I had to get it removed by a locksmith so I could return home with my brand new laptop without the table attached.Kensington was COMPLETELY unhelpful when i addressed this problem and they refuse to get back to me with any kind of refund of any sort.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
1,Dont waste your money,Aweful..wish I had read the reviews first. everyone is correct. I havnt been able to figure out yet how to use the lock...is very hard to set...but I will not even try now after looking at the reviews...I dont need a pofessional locksmith to remove it even it I get it to work. Any one want mine? I will give it to you for free.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"As has been mentioned in several of the reviews for this product, the lock has a tendency to ""forget"" the combination you have set. On THREE occasions, I had to start at 000 and try each combination one by one until I reached the new ""mystery"" combination that the lock had set by itself.If the manufacturer has already admitted this defect, Amazon should not carry this product."
2,Reviews on Laptop locks,"http://www.security.org (under Alerts section) gave a poor ratings for this kind of Laptop locks. ""Each of these locks can be easily bypassed, which can result in the theft of laptop computers within seconds, and without any forensic trace"". Locks such as Kensington ComboSaver, Microsaver and Master Lock including Targus Defcon CL and Compucage Benji.MacWorld Magazine (May2005) Gave poor ratings to this kind of lock also.http://www.macworld.com/2005/04/features/macmobility/index3.php"
1,Painful to use,"* Took me 10 mins to figure out how it works. Not a very good design.* It is easy to lock it so that the combination indicator/arrow points downwards - which means you cannot see the combination to set to so that you can unlock it. If you land up in this situation, the only way is to lift the laptop along with the lock and set the combination to unlock the lock - while you are lifting the laptop.I know - my second observation is hard to understand unless you actually experience it.Dump this Kensington lock. Instead, go with the Targus DEFCON CL Cable Combination Lock."
1,Not A Secure Lock - Read How I Removed It,"I bought the Kensington ComboSaver to secure my laptop at work. The product was easy to use and the combo easy to change. I used it for about a week, and then needed to change the combination. I set the correct combo, flipped the lever, set the new combo, and flipped the lever back. I then locked my notebook as usual. At the end of the day, I set the new combo and the lock would not unlock. I set the old combo and that didn't work either. Maybe I did something wrong?The kicker is that I got some regular wire cutters and was able to pretty easily cut through the security cable, nipping at it bit by bit for a few minutes. I was shocked it was that easy. Next, to detach the lock from my laptop I used a regular battery powered drill with a regular drill bit and drilled through the end of the lock. Within just 5 minutes the end of the lock came off and using some needle nose pliers I pulled of each of the rings. Voila!"
1,No security & difficult to use,"Not a particularly easy lock to use (combo part rotates freely when not in computer, making it difficult to set the combo). Also changing combo is very easy to do accidently. However this is usually not a problem because it is incredibly easy to figure out the combo. I am not a professional lock picker, and I am able to break the combo without any difficulty (which is a problem with many low quality combo locks, but this design try to avoid it at all).I've noticed a lot of people have a problem with the lock ""spontaneously"" changing combinations. It's probably not because the lock is defective. It's probably because they inadvertently changed the combination because the mechanism to change it is so easy to engage.I would definitely never suggest this product to anyone (unless I really wanted their computer)."
1,Bad lock,"I bought this lock for my laptop at school. After locking it to my desk, it would not unlock. I couldn't figure out the new combination so I contacted Kensington, who said that they would reimburse me for a locksmith. I ended up opening the part of the lock that stores the cable with a pair of scissors. Once that part was opened I was able to easily remove the cable and unattach the laptop from my desk. If I could do this, any idiot with a pair of scissors and five minutes would have been able to as well."
1,Horrible lock,Like other people here my lock spontaneously changed its combination on me....Surprise! My laptop is currently locked up at my desk at work which ruined my day and is ruining my night. Another stressor I do not need to deal with...do not get this lock if you value the mobility of your laptop over a theft deterrant.
2,ok at best.,"The stickers in the book have to go in order in order to make the book understandable... I found myself putting all the stickers in it, because my son (age 4) didn't want to put them where they belong (let alone put them in straight)...The stickers come off easily, and I suspect that in a few days they will be all over... These stickers are not REUSABLE... and will lose there stick... Just like any other normal sticker. the book is skinny and flimsy! I'm not impressed...The front of the book shows sticker that go on the pictures... not the case at all... It's more like read 5 words and figure out what the picture represents... blah.The butterfly on the cover of the book that looks like a sticker isn't even in the book.Another thing... when I was pealing out the stickers... I ended up bending the flimsy book up... grrr.the first and last page are the sticker pages... which the used up sheet can not easily be removed... I did try but gave up before destroying the book for good."
5,"Amazing, can melt listening to it","Simply astonishing. I loved the CD. The sound of the clarinet is gorgeous, can make me relax at any time of the day. I really recommend if you're a fan of clarinet sound and easy listening music. Well worth the investiment."
3,Very good for the young reader,A very cute story with a good mix of magic and adventure.Meant for the younger reader but enjoyable to all.
4,Ennchanting,"A Well-Timed Enchantment is a great tale consisting of thrill, love, and magic. When Deanna drops her watch in a magic well she suddenley goes back in time. This was definately not her idea of a good vacation in France! She was sent back in time to medevil France with her friend Oliver, a cat, who gets turned into a handsom boy. Deanna must find her watch before anybody in medevil France does ot her worl as she knows it will be destroyed. Vivian Veene creates a great picture in the readers mind. It is like watching a movie. Next time you feel like a little excitement and fun i strongly suggest you read this fantastic book! The twist at the end shoud surely interest you and set your mind to wondering! It did for me. I deffinately recomend this book to all readers, the girls will especially like it."
3,"a helpless heroine, but Oliver is a great character","This book is worth reading if only for the character of Oliver, a cat turned human. It's amazing...he speaks, thinks, and observes the world as I'm sure only a cat could. The rest of the book is fluff, but basically enjoyable...if you can overlook all the glaring historical inaccuracies. Also, the heroine often infuriated me with her helpless, clueless attitude (having just finished ""Ella Enchanted"" which featured such an amazing heroine, I was highly disappointed in this one). Nevertheless, it provided entertainment for a few hours, and some of Vivian Velde's details were amazingly imaginative. I must end, once again, by proclaiming that the character of Oliver is superb!! Most cat owners are probably aware that their pets see the world differently and it's fun to see that difference voiced."
5,Two thumbs up,"Kids love scooby...one on here is one that I saw when I was a kid and had on tape. The tape stopped working this year, so very thankfuly I could find. Kids love it!"
4,My little guy loves it.,The movies I purchased were delivered right on time. My little guy and myself enjoyed them during the holiday season.
1,What happened to quality?,I can't believe this book made it past publishing. The book was juvenile and overdramatic. The only saving grace was how short it was.
1,Horrible!,"One of the worset books I've ever had the misfortune to come across, to the point that I was seriously wondering what book the other reviewer was reading as it certianly wasn't the same book I read. It's a pity I couldn't have given it zero stars as it doesn't deserve the 1 I had to give it."
5,Hole Is Back! And Better Than Ever!,"This album is in the matter of opinions, if you like hole more poppy then this is the best album, if you like hole grungy, than this may not be the best choice. For hole's last album it, well isn't the best. It's sad that hole made lots of great music and bombed out at the end. I'm not saying that this album sucked, but i expected better. How can you blame them, Patty Schemel left the band shortly after the release and Melissa Auf der Maur left in 1999. Good album, the best tracks (in my opinion) are: Celebrity Skin,Awful,Malibu,Playing your Song, Dying and Petals. FYI: Did you know that there were 4 different titles in debate for this album? They were, Courtney Love suggested, Reasons To Be Beautiful, Eric Erlandson suggested, Sugar Coma, and Melissa Auf der Maur suggested Best Sunday Dress, but in the end they agreed on Celebrity Skin."
4,The only good thing Hole ever did.,"As somebody who absolutely hated all previous Hole albums, and the fact that I never liked Courtney Love (drug-fuled rage never sounds good coming from her), this album was a real suprise.The songs are actually listenable, ""Malibu"", ""Celeberty Skin"", and ""Awful"" (perhaps a good descriptive title for their earlier matereal) are great songs I can listen to when I am in the mood for good, solid rock. Billy Corgan might have done Hole a big favour."
3,can't wait for summer and the convertible,"just got it. haven't stopped listening. the record i most likely will pop in the car cd player especially on long trips. thank god it's not ""Live"". ""Live"" is great but there's nothing worse than a band that tries to copy a former hit album."
3,Compelling Work From Courtney & Co.,"Melodic & appealing,Courtney's lyrics & the bands tunes call for repeated listening & is definitely one of the best albums to be realeased this year.Most of the songs are catchy & quite remarkable,where Courtney effectively conveys the meaning & nuances of her words proving how much of a fine singer she is.MY RATING FOR THIS IS 3 & A HALF STARS."
3,"I bought worse, but I've heard better","Celebrity Skin isnt a bad album but its not the greatest. Its a far cry from Live Through This but still worth listening to. Love seems to taken it easy on this one. Perhaps resting her raspy vocals? The title track is by far the best song, it kind of reminds you of the ""good ol' Hole days. The rest is decent but not great"
3,Surprisingly Appealing.,"While I'm not much of a Hole fan, I must admit this album is fairly good. I decided to buy it after hearing the beautiful ballad 'Malibu' on the radio. I was suprised by how many other good songs there are on this CD. Including the hauntingly beautiful 'Northern Star' and the great pop-sounding 'Boys on the Radio'. But be warned as good as this album is, if you came in expecting the rage driven Hole of the early 90's.. you will be very disapointed."
2,Anemic with a few good points,"OK, what happened? Supposedly this album was difficult to make for Hole. That's somewhat surprising, considering how predictable and, well, boring all the material in Celebrity Skin is. It seems Hole has morphed into pop/rock, which could have been great. All artists evolve. But what Hole seems to have evolved into is yet another generic pop group with a sexy sounding singer complete with guitars and drums. Don't get me wrong; Petals, Celebrity Skin, and other select songs still have a bit of that old Hole punch, but the rest sounds all alike. Granted, Hole isn't yet on par with *shudder* Britney Spears, but they have gone down on quality."
2,uggghhh,"I gave this cd 2 stars because I only listen to it when I go to the gym. And that's only because it kills time. I'm convinced that Billy Corgan gave Ms. Love the help that she sorely needed. Like Kurt Cobain and Kim Gorden before him, Corgan became Hole's 'ghost writer'"
2,Why Does She Want to Be Stevie Nicks?,"What happened to Courtney? First she went to a Fleetwood Mac concert and then had the plastic surgeons give her a new face. I liked her when she was a pig(I mean that in a nice way), she was at her most honest and sincere. Now, it's like ""hey I want a '70's rock band."" Well, it's not being innovative or original when you want to revert to a different era because its already been done. And what's so great about Stevie Nicks anyway she was a big, fat coccaine addict for two decades, who made cheesy songs for the most part."
1,"Find a ""hole"" and bury this garbage!","This is NOT rock music. Check out Aerosmith, Def Leppard, or Led Zeppelin. Why would anyone want to listen to this stuff?"
5,"HOLE'S ""BORN IN THE USA""","Whatever else CELEBRITY SKIN is, it is Hole's friendliest record, inviting everybody for the ride. Of course, much of the ride is through scary and depressing territory, where lovers and friends turn cold shoulders, but that doesn't negate the adventure of taking the trip. Like Bruce Springsteen's BORN IN THE U.S.A., this record's bright, poppy, slick surface--or skin, if you will--is a brilliant disguise for the rage and despair within (except Courtney Love's is personal, as opposed to the political/social concerns of Springsteen). Love may not be ""rock & roll future,"" but she'll do until somebody who IS comes along."
5,"Very,Very Cool","This is an absolutely spectacular CD. Actually it's 2 CD's,but you already knew that. I have the normal CD,but I couldn't pass this one up. The second CD with all the live tracks is one of the best I've ever heard. It has Pretty On The Inside(which is one of my favorite Hole songs). Plus 5 other songs. One of which is called Paradise City.It's a Guns&Roses song(I despise that band),but Hole did a great job on it considering it was a ""joke cover"".You also get plenty of Courtney's stage banter, which is a real treat. She really let's one guy in the audience have it,and of course she comments on the fact that she lost her voice on a Guns&Roses song. Anyway the live tracks rock,and Courtney's stage banter is really cool and funny. I suggest you get this album."
5,"West coast loves it, East coast hates it. Let's consider.","After reading over 40 of the amazon reviews, it became apparent that the geographic influences on the album, obviously California and Seattle, are also the epicenter of the album's fan-base. NYC seems to shun the effort as trite recycled 80s pop re-packaged (slightly). As a long-time Hole fan, i can tell you, i personally love the album but miss the desperation and crude imagery of POTI and LTT. on Dying, when courtney whispers something dark and ugly about a cripple dance (?) i get a yearning for more of that strange, dark poetry found in older songs like ""old age"" & ""best sunday dress"". still, courtney's eerie clarity shines through on Celeb Skin. new york, lighten up, it's not meant to be a revolution. maybe y'all need more sunshine, go fly away, to Malibu. it's where you drown your scars."
4,A summary of a twisted life in Hollywood.,"Although quite diffrent from their last release. Celebrity Skin is a well blended mix of fairytale rock, old-style grunge, and energetic pop melodies. A must have for any lover of rock n' roll."
5,Throw away your boy bands and replace them with this album..,"After watching the really great video for the title track (which is also my favorite) Celebrity Skin, I bought the album and immediately fell in love with it. Courtney Love's vengeful words and awesome guitar made the album as great as it is. I recommend this album to anyone who's upset with where music is going these days. It's an angry yet all around amazing album."
5,Quite an interesting creation,"I usually don't listen to bands like Hole, but once I saw the ""Malibu"" video on VH1, I knew that I needed to give this album a try. ""Celebrity Skin"" is also a great song. Just listen to the lyrics. It may take you a while before you understand them, but eventually you will understand the message. Last week I was listening to a song on the radio, and the voice sounded like Courtney Love's. Little did I know that it was ""Awful."" That's a great song as well, and I hope it becomes a big hit. I normally listen to bands like Matchbox 20, Semisonic, and Barenaked Ladies, so this album gave me a chance to try something new. This is a very unique album that should be heard to be believed."
1,"3 words for you: ja, ja, ja...","This album is no, good. Listen to Celebrity Skin and then play Drain You by Nirvana on Nevermind, hmmm the instruments are the same, and that's like stupid, using the same music as Kurt Cobain. Well, Hole is on a hole from where they'll never come out."
3,Hole fan.,"Courtney, you can do better than this. I mean, if Sixpence None The Richer were to sing ""Malibu"", there would be no difference at all it would sound just like the ""new"" Hole. It sounds too pop. What happened to the REAL Courtney Love? Her REAL attitude has gone out the window :("
2,WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TIARAS AND BABYDOLL DRESSES??,"she's lost her emotion and sounds like a robot, or like someone is sitting on her stomach. if you're not a hole fan, you may like it, if you're a hole fan, you will be disappointed, i know i was. play it if you need some background noise. i liked it when she was pissy and bitchy, c'mon and scream already!!!!!"
5,Hole is the BEST band ever!!!!,Hole is a really good band. Their songs remind me of my life and the people in it. They arereally good role models for young people.
4,"I do miss the old Hole,","but this album is still really cool. All of the songs are good - I just wish that every once in a while, Courtney would break out and start yelling. This album still has the goods though. All songs are good. Even if you liked the rage of Live Through This and Pretty on the Inside, buy this CD, even though it doesn't have that rage. Rating: A-"
4,"'Skin' a more mature, less impactful album with exceptions","'Celebrity Skin' shows another stage in the growth of Hole from hardcore grunge to melodic modern rock. Many of the tracks come off as weak versions of 'Live Through This' tracks, with two notable exceptions. The tracks 'Boys on the Radio' and 'Use Once and Destroy' are two of the best songs I've herad in a while. They are well crafted and by themselves justify the purchase of the album."
1,Courteny Love's worst travesty yet...,"First, she had Kurt Cobain write Live Through This, now she had Billy Corgan write Celebrity Skin. How long do we, the intelligent people, have to wait before everyone sees that she killed her husband? Courteny Love is a liar, a poser, and evil for depriving the world of such a beautiful person. Let's not let her get away with it. Let's not give her the attention she so craves. I'd rather her fade from sight than burn out."
2,This is another hole cd,"Oh my God! Sure am glad I didn't buy this cd! Whew, that was close. So really the songs weren't all that bad, but i'm not really into pop rock. Anymore. I would have liked this cd like two years ago. Oh well lets see uh, Petals, Northern Star and Playing your song are good songs. Malibu and Celebrity Skin are mediocre. The rest are bad. Except for ""Awful"". That song was grotesque and painful to hear. I wish I had never encountered that song. It is, ironically enough, an awful song. I have strong personal feelings about it. It's just so ugly! What was Hole thinking? They just made all these great albums and then went and made Cebrity skin. This cd just should not have happened. Ever."
2,Good album. Terrible Hole album.,"The album was good, but Hole is a million times better than this. This is by far their worst album... ""Celebrity Skin"" and ""Playing your song"" Saved it from complete destruction, but not enough to pull it from the rubble. If you like hole, get a differant album."
3,Lacks real quality,"It is now four years since the alternative-rock masterpiece `Live Through This' and now Courtney Love has decided to get back to making music again after becoming a Hollywood celebrity. The result is a more pop-orientated record containing a couple of classics but also too many average songs. The opening two tracks, `Celebrity Skin' and `Awful' are the best songs on the album. The other brilliant songs are `Dying' and `Use Once And Destroy' which show that Hole can do poppy and melodic rock songs that have moved on from the tuneless but emotionally gripping `Pretty On the Inside'. The latter sounds familiarly close to Smashing Pumpkins `Soma' in Courtney's singing. However, a large number of fans from Hole's early days will miss the jagged rage and pure emotion of Hole's first two albums that made them so special to the listener. Nowadays Hole want to please the mainstream as the album contains many songs that could become good singles on the radio."
3,Poor little rich girl.....waaaaaa!,"A noise came from behind me like ewwwwww. I turn to realize that it wasn't me...it was her and that fricken CD! I'd say if you related to this CD then you should spend your money on a Doctor of Mental Health. The music, short of finding another word for it, is basic and lacks any creativity. The words are mindless and without direction. Maybe I'm wrong, but the album smells like teen waste!"
5,"""...wilted & faded, somewhere in hollywood...""","""celebrity skin"" is a masterpiece. some speculate that they ahve ""sold out"" because ""celebrity skin"" isn't the angry fireball that was ""pretty on the inside"" & ""live tough this"" i completely disagree. every song on this alabam shines. 7 even if you are someone who thinks this albam is popish sounding, you must addmitt that lyricly, skin is amazing. from the haunting ""northern star"" to the uppity ""heaven tonight"" it is all great. my favorites would be ""reasons to be beautiful"" ""playing your song"" ""use once & destory"" ""malibu""...oh hell, they're all great i can't pick a favorite."
3,Reasons to Have This One,"Hole's third album is mostly fanous for the song ""Celebrity Skin"" (the lyrics: yeah, so glad we made it, yeah now you really---etc) but it has also great songs like ""Awful"", ""Malibu"", ""Dying"", ""Northern Star"", ""Heaven Tonight"". Courtney Love's voice is much softer than in her solo albums or in ""Live Thought This"" album. Songs are typically about sex and living. I think this is not as great as Hole's second one ""Live..."" but it is quite different from it...maybe a little bit more commercial. I think Hole is the best female rock bands since ""The Runaways"" in 70's. It has some kind of magic which can only be caused by Courtney Love's voice.Stars: Celebrity Skin, Awful, Malibu"
1,The most boring album I've ever sat through,"I find it hard to believe this is the same band that wrote songs with lyrics like ""Go on, take everything, I dare you to!"" and performed them with conviction and intensity. Courtney Love is now playing music that my parents like...hey, my mother actually digs 'Malibu', but I think it's corny.This album was a very painful experience, as I resisted the urge to hit the skip button on my CD player many times. It was quite an ordeal, and I'll never go through it again. Every song reminds me of those awful '80s love songs and groups like Heart and Fleetwood Mac. I don't hear any honesty in these songs...the oomph present in the band's earlier albums is totally missing here. Maybe they will find it again on their next album, but we'll have to wait until 2002 to find out."
2,So NOT Courtney,"I was really disappointed with this CD. It is nothing like ""Live Through This"", and was not at all up to the standards of the Grunge Goddess, I am a fan of. The first 2 tracks are the only good ones, the rest sound more like the ""Go-Go's"", pop from the 80's, rather than the raw, hard-edged music I was expecting from Hole..........."
2,some of it is 'okay',"I wish this record was a 'follow up' to Live Through This..but it wasnt... It was a culmination of what Cortney Love has become...and that's not what fueled her good songs...not at all. Having Billy write some songs..helps, but Courtney cant cut with songs like these."
5,Celebrity Skin will become your Second Skin,"This has got to be the greatest CD I have ever been given as a gift. I can't count how many times I've given it as a gift. The lyrics contained in Celebrity Skin fit any mood, any time. There is not one song on the CD that is light in content or music, and not one song will be skipped. I can tell you from firsthand experience straight out of the mosh-pit at their Cleveland show this summer, that Hole totally rocks. And, after meeting the band after the show, they were even better. Buy it."
4,This is not what you would expect from Courtney,"This album is very different from what we have seen from Hole in the past. The lyrics and the songs are not as harsh and heavy. Celebrity Skin is by no means a continuation of Asking For It. Hole has adopted a new sound, but still keep their qualities than true fans are looking for. ""Awful"" seems more inspired by the Go-Gos than Nirvana. One of the highlights, Northern Star, is definately one to tune in on. The instrumentals on that song seems to point to a PJ Harvey kind of sound. As time progresses Hole is moving away towards their alternative roots, and climbing towards a more pop sound. If you like Hole for the graphic lyrics, screaming, and heavy guitar, you won't find it here. On my first listen, I was disapointed, but as I kept replaying the album, I grew to like it more and more."
5,Incredably meaningful and moving,"courtney did a great job with this album. She's obviously put heaps of thought into the lyrics and musical formation of this album. her lyrics deal with a lot of tough situations that she has been through in the past four years.Melissa harmonises amazingly, and really seems to belong to the band. This album is really together and Hole's music seems to have matured. most of the songs are more in the range of doll parts than violet. My favourite song on the album is track number 6 dying.It is a beautiful album, with more hidden meaning than the public will ever understand."
1,Boring adult contemporary fodder,"What happened to rock goddess Courtney Love? She helped launch the riot grrl movement with L7 and Bikini Kill - and now she puts out an album that can easily get played between Madonna and Celine Dion on the adult contemporary stations. Sure enough, the other day when I was changing stations, I heard 'Malibu' on the local soft rock station. This totally lacks the intensity or emotion of Hole's early albums. The best songs on this album are actually not even as good as the worst songs on Live Through This. And don't even get me started on how trite the lyrics are! In short, if you like Madonna, Celine Dion or other soft rock artists, you will probably love Hole's new album. Anyone who bought and enjoyed Hole's first two albums should definitely avoid this like the plague. It's innocuous, bland and tame - the antithesis of what Hole was initially all about."
1,NO CLASS,"I know courtney wants to be some sort of hollywood starlet. but her personality does not fit with the image she is trying to cultivate.she is NOT sultry or glamorous. she has too much damage. she would be better served trying to work with what she has rather than putting on a goofy mask. madonna kind of pulled it off... maybe a little bit... but courtney needs a new take. maybe a Herzog Fassbinder Hesher type of movie star glam. The bangles first e.p. was really dope. I wouldn't write them off for ""walk like an egyptian""i like the first couple of hole records. i also like the surgery!!! money well spent! It's the brain that needs the surgery now!"
3,Above average Pop Rock album.,For a major label Indie album this had much more focused and melodic songwriting than the first two. The A and R look on her first album was much better than this cover. My complaint is that the cover didn't match their Glam Proto meets retro A and R. Fans of Big Star should take note that many of the hits on this album were great but disliked by the mainstream.
5,EXCELLENT IF YOU LIKE MUSIC OF ANY KIND YOU WILL LOV E THIS,"i am a major fan of rap but during a music video show i heard ""celebrity skin"" so i bought the album. it is totally off the hook, it doesn't hurt that courtney love is so damn hot either!!!!! i love ""malibu"" and ""awful"" to. pick this joint up"
5,Celebrity Skin isn't Live Through This - so what?,"Yes, this album IS different to 'Live Through This', in the same way that 'Live Through This' was different to 'Pretty on the Inside'. That's called GROWTH, people. So Hole have got a little poppy - grunge is a dinosaur now, and they're getting on with their lives. That doesn't mean that the songs are worse. Courtney's lyrics are still among the most astonishing ever written. She still has her images, her emotions, her anger. 'Celebrity Skin' has so much variety on it. You want Guitar Grunt? Try the brutal assult of the title track, or the brilliant 'reasons to be beautiful'. Play those loud and you won't be disappointed. Pop's catered for, and so are ballads - 'Northern Star' and the beautiful aching 'Dying'. Celebrity Skin is my pick for the album of 1998. It ISN'T Live Through This - but it IS beautiful, poignant, and an amazing piece of work that sounds fresh and innovative."
5,"Makeover or no, Courtney kicks ass","As good as Live Through This, albeit with a more polished sound. The first five songs are as good a block of music as I've heard in a long time, especially ""Awful."" Madonna-friend or not, Courtney Love still has her edge."
4,"""Malibu"" is the worst song on the album...","This is a good album, but Courtney belongs in the heavy style of music that she evolved in. I bought ""Live Through This"" shortly after this album and believe me - their earlier songs were better. ""Malibu"" is TOO SAPPY for Hole - the group that defined angry girl rock along with PJ Harvey, Bikini Kill, L7, etc... in the early nineties. L like this album and all, but the grunge lives in Hole and it needs to released again. This album just doesn't stun like their earlier albums... Rating: B+"
4,Lyrical Anguish + Monster Hooks = One Terrific Record,"I can honestly say I don't know a whole lot about this band other than what has been osmosed about its leader from our every reliable media. That doesn't prevent me from enjoying every minute of it though. State of the art production, buzz saw guitars, layer upon layer of harmonies, and Love's vocals and lyrics which as interesting as they are . . . well let's just say she needs to enjoy life a bit more. I believe the record is up for the Grammy and sincerely hope it wins. It's that good. Then maybe, just maybe that will put a smile on Courtney's face and a little joy in her heart, if only for a moment. Pick this up."
4,Brilliant Listening !,"I dont know Love's previous work , and i dont care . This CD shocked me in the best possible way , every song is sincere , the lyrics are like poetry on speed and the guitar riffs rock. Billy Corgan has done wonders ! Get this CD and listen to ALL the songs!"
1,Groovy,"This album is way cool. It's possibly the greatest rock disc ever created in the history of the universe. Everyone should worship Hole and believe everything they say. Courtney Love is also way cool. She has the deepest kind of respect for her fans and she never steals her material from other people. That's so cool. She sings songs about shallow, self aggrandizing, profiteering poseurs from the perspective of a shallow, self aggrandizing, profiteering poseur. That's also cool."
3,"same old, same old","The same old threee or four chords arranged differently for the thousandth time... Anyway, it's a good rock album."
1,Really deep in the hole...,"THis album should have been called ""SHALLOW SKIN"", so false and shallow it is. HOLE was never a band, just the greedy Courtney Love trying (and obtaining!!) more money to her bank account. CELEBRITY SKIN is even wrose than LIVE THROUGH THIS (if that was possible!!)No wonder the band closed its operations recently. It already fullfilled its purposes: fast money."
2,an incredible disappointment...,what else is there to say? after 4 years of waiting I hoped for better
2,Had to throw this one back,"Beyond the title track, the songwriting is uneven. The glossy production seems a bit too heavy for the band to carry. Vocals and lyrics are medocre."
1,Digging their own Hole.,"All I gotta say is this: Courtney, you cannot sing. Why try to attempt something you're just not good at? And for the rest of the band, learn to play around with some different guitar effects, get creative. Also, why don't you guys sit down and write an actual song! Good idea! instead of having Kurt Cobain or Billy Corgan write them for you. This is like the Spice Girls of alternative. All manufactured, all hyped up for nothing. Do yourself a favor and buy Human Waste Project's cd instead."
1,Nice Job Courtney....NOT!!!,1st you live off the fame of your dead husband then you take credit for lyrics that Billy Corgan helped write! Come on. Someone please pinch me so I will wake up from this nightmare and Hole will go away.
1,disgraceful,i hate these crappy female rock bandsgeneric guitarpoor vocalsextremely droopy bassid give this album negative stars if such things were possible
3,Courtney Polished,"This is a pop-polished version of ""Live Through This"". It doesn't have the strength or the grit. The songs are decent, you can enjoy them in all of their pop glory, but this CD doesn't have the solid realism of its predecessor."
2,Is this what rock music is coming to?,"Celebrity Skin is the only good ""Rock"" song on the entire album. The lyrics in the rest of the songs look like they were written by Hole but they don't sound like Hole. Their music in the past was harsh rock music, and if that's what you're looking for just buy the old Hole, not the ""new Bananarama""."
2,"Never buy a cd where the ""Hit"" is the first song...","The first song ""Celebrity Skin"" was catchy, the other woman in the song was nice, but after the first song... It goes downhill real fast. I would have preferred an album full of cynical fluff like the first song, instead of boring crap like the rest of the album."
2,What Hole is this?,"This is not the same Hole that stunned the rock community with their first album. Perhaps because Courtney was unable to find any more of her late husband's lyrics, or maybe they just peaked already. Either way, this disk sounds like a Smashing Pumpkins album with Courtney Love singing vocals rather than Billy Corgan, whom helped produce and compose many of the tracks on this new release.They have a poppy new sound, are a little more upbeat, and probably have a hit on thier hands. Everything the first album wasn't(Poppy and upbeat). Giving further credence to those whom say Courtney used songs written by Kurt Cobain on the first album, then needed Billy Corgans help to make a second one. Maybe thier third album will be original, and the band will have found thier voice."
1,Hole is most possibly the worst band ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Courtney love is stupid stop buying this album and promoting her. She is a NO TALENT. Other than the fact she is simply a slut she would have never even had the chance to appear in the public eye she should do everyone a favor and go kill herself or go to work in a whore house where she belongs.
4,Go and buy Hole,I am not a lover of grunge and never will be so I was extremely surprised upon hearing this album. From what I have heard of the first album it is a lot harder sounding than this one. Instead Love has gone all hollywood and produced a great album. I recently went to see Hole at Glastonbury and they were great.
4,A Hole fan .,"It's great, but too commercial. Love has left her REAL roots and went to pop. But, on a lighter note, my favorites are ""Malibu"", ""Reasons to be Beautiful"", ""Use Once and Destroy"", ""Northern Star"", ""Boys on the Radio"", and ""Playing your Song."" Miss Love sure has proved that she can be normal, but underneath it all...TRASH IS TRASH. And this album is not trash, just her new attitude."
2,I can't believe I bought the Hole thing...,"Yawn, I can imagine teams of Kurt ""No Brain"" fans and Hole teeny boppers loving this stuff. Her ""^%&ing great album"" (her words) is hard to stay awake to. The first song teamed with its video was a ploy to get people to buy, but the rest of the CD is close to the best of Yoko Ono's melodious work. You'd have to really hate rock to really like this album. I give it 2 stars since I have bought far worse."
4,Celebrity Skin.. a title that describes it all,"I'm a huge Hole fan, so of course, I believe that this CD is great. This isn't my favorite Hole CD, but I still do enjoy it. It's a lot softer than the other Hole CD's, but it is still good. My favorite songs are ""Northern Star,"" ""Dying,"" ""Reasons to be Beautiful,"" and ""Hit So Hard.""I like all of the songs on this album, but if you are into harder rock, then this probably isn't the best CD to get. Hole rocks hard on this CD, but it is not as hard as their previous CD's."
2,THE HOLE TRUTH,"Finally, the truth is revealed. It is as obvious as the day is long that the songwriter for the band Hole died right after the release of their seminal album ""Live Through This."" Too bad, because Hole's lead singer can pull it off pretty well. I'd pass on this one. Buy ""Bleach"" instead."
4,Pretty Good,"I think that this CD was a total transformation from ""Live Through This""...not as good. The standout tracks are:CELEBRITY SKIN, wich is a good rock song...AWFUL, which the lyrics are from a old negro praise song, I know scary...HIT SO HARD, lyrics kinda imply that she killed Kurt, I dunno...MALIBU, good peaceful rock song...REASONS TO BE BEAUTIFUL is a grungy type song...DYING is a nice slow ballad...NORTHERN STAR is Courtney getting in touch with her Indian roots :-) ...PLAYING YOUR SONG, my favorite song on the album...So, yeah its a pretty good CD...."
5,Hole 'lotta love!,"Finally, Courtney Love is singing and having fun without screaming her lyrics to get her point across! This Seattle Bad Girl gone Hollywood has ""Lived Through It"" and came out alive and happy to be here. And where else would one end up... Hollywood. Love and the kids from the town of gloom & doom tore off their flannel, traded in their thrift shop outfits for Versace, Gucci and Prada... and made an album that says it all. The songs still contain all the meaningful moans you would expect from Courtney, but all the while she's letting us know that she's happy on the inside and pretty on the outside and she now she's gonna sing about it. Life's not ""Awful"" for her anymore and her ""Celebrity Skin"" is glowing! Cheers to Hole for finding their sun in LA and creating an album that makes you want to get in your car, open the windows and drive through life like you mean it! Hole is the Band of the Century!!!"
5,A shockingly good sound comes from Courney Love and band,"Oh my goodness!!! I am not a big fan ofMs.Love BUT, This CD is an exception. A nice strong beat, good tones, and a nice song behind it. I'm a Beatles, Jewel, Third Eye Blind, 311 fan and this adds to my diversified collection. I like this album a bunch and I give it 2 thumbs up through the roof"
4,This is definatley a good CD......,"I really like this CD. I've never heard any of Hole's other CD's, but this one is definately a good one. My favorite songs are: Celebrity Skin, Hit So Hard, and Malibu. So what if it's not hard rock/grunge?!? It's still worth giving it a try..."
5,Highly readable literary theory,"This fine collection of essays explores the effects of literature in women's lives. I was particularly delighted with essays exploring writers such as Willa Cather and Laura Ingalls Wilder. These authors have had an enormous impact on American girls for generations, but they have not yet received adequate scholarly attention. Nelson's volume continues the feminist literary project of recovering ""lost"" literature, as well as defining the ways in which women are affected and even changed by what they read.Private Voices, Public Lives is exemplary of feminist literary theory in its rejection of an objective interpretive stance, frankly acknowledging the subject position of the interpreter. It is an ideal companion text for women's studies and women's literature courses."
5,Bouncing Souls,This DVD rocks.If you have never heard these guy this is the DVD to get.From the first song to the last every song rocks.
5,Humor and Innocense at its best (Argentinian - Spanish).,"Inodoro Pereyra is a very funny and innocent character living in the Argentine Pampas with his dog ""Mendieta"" and his wife ""Eulogia"". In this book, you can read all the comic strips that were published for 20 years in Argentina, as well as other foreign countries. The author, Roberto Fontanarrosa also known as ""el negro"" was born in Rosario, Argentina, and has delighted his public for a quarter of a century with his play on words and the innocent character of Inodoro Pereyra."
5,Finally on CD,One of the all time great albums. I've had this on vinyl for over 30 years and have been waiting patiently for it to arrive on cd. It's been well worth the wait. The first two cuts alone are worth the price. Enjoy.
4,It's Montand who makes this musical clear,"All right, I like Barbra Streisand and I find that several of her pieces on this album are wonderful (Go to Sleep is my personal favorite). But I disagree with the other reviewers about Montand. His rendition of Melinda is filled with query and longing. And the weakest song on the soundtrack, the title song, is made far clearer in his rendition than it is in Streisand's overblown version. I also find her Love with all the Trimmings to be the beginning of the end of her greatness. Once she fell in love with her own voice, Ms Streisand was no longer as terrific as she was in her early days. Compare the simplicity of the opening bars of the first song with the wailing on the final piece and you'll see what I mean."
3,What does Streisand have that Montand doesn't?,"The film may have been a modest hit at the box office, but it's soundtrack counterpart was an absolute flop, failing to even reach the Top 100. On a more positive note, Streisand's soaring, octave-leaping rendition of the title song is absolutely breathtaking. It has since justifiably become one of her best-loved signature songs. The rest of the disc is considerably enjoyable as well, with Streisand giving lovely renditions of five more Lenner-Lowe compositions. The title song is the only real classic, however several of the other numbers (""Love And All The Trimmings,"" ""He Isn't You"") are almost as good. The lightly comic ""Go To Sleep"" (which features Streisand dueting with herself) is a particular delight. Unfortunately, the album also contains the three Yves Montand solos, which are excruciating and need not have been persevered on disc."
2,misunderstood,"I thought this item was a video, not the cd as it was misleading in the advertising. I was disappointed."
1,Where'd all the songs go?,"Great idea for a movie, but simply wasted. 2/3rds of the songs are missing from the original play! And Barbara Harris is just simply better. But the original Broadway cast recording and rejoice."
5,Excellent book,"the book is interesting for the kids, it is very easy to understand. I highly recommend it.My kid enjoyed and each time he completes a chapter or a page, I give him one of the stickers the book has, and it keeps him motivated."
2,"Doesn't seem like a 4th grade book, more like 3rd grade","I don't know if this review will be helpful or not but I wanted to give my input. I'm looking for a book for my son who just completed 3rd grade, to keep his brain active over the summer. Another reviewer mentioned that this book isn't really fourth grade curriculum in her school, more like third grade review. After reading over the topics in one review and going over them with my son, I'd have to agree. My son went over all this stuff in third grade and isn't in any kind of advanced class. If you're looking for a book that really has fourth grade math work, this doesn't seem to be it."
5,Excellent Book,"Bought this to give my son something constructive to day for a few minutes each day during summer. I had the Sylvan books last year - very childish. This book has the pages full of problems not childish pictures. They are a replica of what he did in school. Pages of mulitplication, division, fractions. A gret review of 3rd grade in the begining and in he end it does start to introduce new concepts (to him), but they are laid out in way that he can figure it out with little assistance. Recommend 100X more then Sylvan books! Wish I would have gotten the English book of this brand too. Unfortunatley I went with the Sylvan book - thinking of eating the cost and ordering the English one from this company too."
5,"Clear, Helpful and Enjoyable!","My 4th grader used this the summer before starting 4th grade and we continue to use it to keep math facts solid and to provide extra practice for new topics. Over the summer she mastered her times-tables with the help of this book, increasing her confidence. This year, her test scores have likewise improved.The pages themselves provide many practice sets that are *not* bogged down with silly cartoons or extranous text/pictures. It's all relevant! The graphics are eye-pleasing. My daughter enjoys the star-chart and likes using the book.I highly recommend this to any parent of a 3rd or 4th grader who wants to help their child excell in math."
4,classroom purchase,I bought this to use in my classroom but it didn't work out for me. I like books I can use to reinforce learning.
3,math,Great book. Very student friendly. Written in simple language so that my slow learners will benefit. The language is simple enough for them to understand.
5,Similar to other DK Math Made Easy,"I buy a book in this series every year for my daugther so she can work on her math during summer break. It's systematically very similar level to level, so it's very helpful and good refresher for kids on what was learned during the past school year and get them ready for the next one.Highly recommended."
2,Extremely boring,"Way too simple as a Math review book for standardized testing. We ended up looking at some of the ""Real Life/Word Problems"" but otherwise did not use the book. There is no Final Test at all, that would cover all the topics. There are golden star stickers though!"
5,What a recording!,"I only wich I could have been at Carnegie Hall that night! Come on, Bernadette Peters, Liza Minnelli, Karen Ziemba, James Naughton, and so much more! After i bought this highlights album I knew I had to get the full 2-CD set. It's great cause it's live, the orchestrations are Heaven, and you will feel like your in new york in the audience. Buy it enjoy it and if you like it is much as I do buy the Video of the performance!"
1,poor marketing communication,"A total misinformation of product. The product was advertised as paperback; then a small print was inserted below: CD only. Well, I was looking for the material that could paperback. I suppose only a book would be made in paper, not CD.I have not used this CD. Sight reading means, reading from the music sheet, not listening from CD."
3,toy is very detailed but TINY!! I expected something much bigger for the money!!,my 4 yr old is in LOVE with Pteredactyls and I searched all over for a toy for her and finally found this one thinking she could use it with her other dinosaur toys. I thought it was alittle high especially when including the $9 in shipping but spent it anyway then I received it (very quickly) and it is TINY!! I definately would NOT have spent nearly $20 on such a little toy. I was very disappointed in the size of it but I'm sure she will still like it and play with it. just be forwarned that it is only about 2 1/2 inches tall the measurments provided lead me to believe that it would be much bigger!!! otherwise it is exactly what it looks like!!
3,Smaller than the way it is advertised,"I bought this toy expecting a 10"" x 5.4"" toy... as advertised. It is actually 9"" (from wing point to wing point) x 3.5"". I specifically looked at the size of the toy before purchasing and definitely thought I was buying a larger dinosaur. My daughter has a bunch of smaller dinosaurs that cost very little... and this one will just get mixed in with the cheapy ones. I doubt it will be anything memorable for her this Christmas, but we shall see. Now, after seeing it in person, it is worth $2 in my opinion."
5,Beautiful detail,Very nice detail and a great price. My two year old son loves it. I will only buy dinosaurs made by Papo from now on.
3,A bit smaler then I had hoped for.,This item was a bit smaller then what I had hoped for but our child loved it anyway. The colors are very realistic and the material is very durable.
5,Great Pterosaur,"Excellent little model of this Pterosaur. Very detailed and realistic (I assume) looking. Love it, but wish it was bigger. Great price and very quick shipping too. Thanks. :O)"
2,EXTREMELY SMALL,"this item is way to small- a kid could very easily damage it. If it had been larger, I would reccomended it."
5,great dino!,"We love this dino! It looks awesome! I have to say that all Papo Dinosaurs have really impressed me. I have seen many different prices for it. I would wait until you see it for around six dollars. No need to pay more than that, so right now over priced on amazon. For six bucks its a great buy!"
2,not what I expected,"The item is a cheap rubber toy. I'd expect for 12 dollars it was ceramic or something. This item is worth $1.99 it is not unique, it is smaller than expected. Not impressed."
1,Very cheaply made,a piece was missing at the end of the clip so it was defective and broke right awaydo not buy this
4,copyholder,This unit works fine but the included sticky mounting tape does not hold very well. I had to use the clip instead.
2,Flexclip Copyholder,The design is fine however the base that is supposed to stick to the top of the computer monitor does not stay adhered even when holding one sheet of paper. It is NOT sticky enough!Flexclip Copyholder - Black
4,Great Product!,"This is a great product for holding papers from pc or laptop. For some reason, it is not carried in most stores anymore, so I bought it on line!"
3,Flexclip - easy to break,"I like the flex clip when it works. It's particularly convenient for laptops since they are not always on desks, and the clip allows the copy to be held up next to the computer when it is in your lap. My two chief complaints is that the clip is easily breakable (think plastic pants hanger), and that when the copy you are holding up is heavy (a packet of papers) the clip bends down and the papers can't be suspended in the air. All that said, I still use the clip because it is the best product that I have found so far for a laptop that I like to hold on my lap."
3,Flexcip Copyholder,"I love how this takes up NO space on a desk. The first one I had was perfect because the monitor was bigger. It's harder to get it to adhere well to a very narrow monitor (i.e. flat screen). For some reason, the first one just broke to pieces when I pressed the clip to attach it to the new monitor, so I ordered a new one. I'd had the first one for several years."
1,unique idea but the first one broke,A really neat idea and the only one I saw on the web. The first one broke while removing it from the PAPER packaging--the spring in one of the clips broke loose. Fortunately the merchant's service was excellent and now it is quite helpful
3,Didn't seem to help,I accidently got the pin caught in the car door at my local Home Depot. This thing was going off loud and clear while I was frantically trying to find the pin. In the 2-3 minutes I was searching not one person came to see what the noise was about. Two women in a Home Depot parking lot at 10:00 in the morning in an affluent area. Nobody even looked our way. It really wasn't loud enough
1,Not a great deal.,"First one arrived with dead batteries, so we replaced them at the store for the cost of $20 ! It still didn't work so we had it replaced. The batteries in the new one didn't work either! Just remember to add $20 to the great deal you think you are getting!"
4,Item not as pictured!,"Wife have this on her car keys set. Tried it and very very loud. Will surely attract attention and scare away bad guys. ******do not expect to get what's pictured, it's white with black lanyard.******"
5,Excelent,These are awesome little personal alarms. My preppers group uses these in conjunction with trip wire to secure a perimiter around the camphide. I do recomend them and this seller as well because of the great price for this quality and the lightning fast shipping.
3,too much pedal or echo,"These performances here by Richter demonstrate the ""Romantic"" approach toward Bach, which is a bit outdated and controversial. Either Richter used the sustaining pedal a lot or the engineering added some reverberation, for there is far too much muddiness here for Bach, in my opinion. Plus, I find many of the tempi to be inappropriate. With Bach, the melody dictates the tempo, and Richter did not seem to capture the right tempi at times.I realize that Bach can be played too dryly at times, as with Gould. Deciding how to play Bach on the piano is, admittedly, a difficult decision. But, I do not feel that anyone should ever use the sustaining pedal when playing Bach, which appears to be the case here. Of course, Richter is a very fine pianist, and what I am criticizing here is his ""Romantic"" approach, not his playing."
3,no filter,"I am happy with the power of the pump, it has alot of pressure. What I didnt like about the pump is that there is no filter, it sucks all the algee in and you have to clean it about 2-3 times a week. If your pond is clean, then this is an excellent pump. But with the hot weather we had this year, I had alot of algee."
5,Best Book,Powerful Food for Powerful Minds & Bodies is and excellent book for pre-teens and teenagers to develop good eating habits. The recipes are good and simple to make. The design of the book is very attractive and makes you want to view every page.
2,Misleadingly-titled compilation of standards,"The idea that this is a tribute to Michael Buble is amusing, since the Buble's own albums mostly consists of covers of existing pop classics. A more apt, if less catchy, title would therefore have been ""an instrumental tribute album to some old standards that have been previously covered by Michael Buble"".I can't argue with the choice of songs (ranging from Van Morrison's ""Moondance"" and Cole Porter's ""I Got You Under My Skin"" to The Bee Gees' ""How Can You Mend a Broken Heart""), but the performance and interpretation (by a musician called Tom Bartsch) barely rise above the level of piano-bar/dining room music at best, and shopping-mall elevator muzak at worst.This is a pleasant but utterly forgettable instrumental album, better suited as low-volume background music for other activies (reading, working, paying your bills etc.)."
3,not really a scrub but more a wash,Tried this after Nivia Men's Scrub changed their formula from Energizing to Revitalizing formula which is like this Neturogena Mens Scrub. it has some grit to it but the pellets quickly dissolve and don't have time to do any scrub or exfoliating.Off to see if I can find anyone with old stock of Nivia Mens ENERGIZING scrub.
4,Husband likes it,"Husband has a very different kind of acne and sensitive skin, and so he'll often grown out his beard and mustache just so he doesn't have to deal with shaving. Neutrogena products have been good to his skin."
3,"Not the best, not the worst.","Like my self, most men deal with the weekly task of shaving. Razor bumps are never fun or pleasing to deal with, they look horrible and just itch! This product definitely reduces SOME of the bumps but not all of them. Results will most likely vary between customers and their individual skin conditions. Its okay for me, I am going to keep looking for better razor bump products."
3,Feels nice,"I don't have too much to talk about this product. I'm not using it regularly. What I can say is that it's OK and that you have a good felling of taking care of yourself. It seems it facilitates the razor process. However, it's provides a very light scrub and it doesn't seem it's really cleaning your pores."
5,Worked Great,"This did exactly what is was supposed to do. A bit pricey, but it solved the undercounter TV problem in our kitchen."
4,Enjoyable but somewhat neglected Lerner & Loewe score,"Even though the show was not a huge hit on stage, the original cast recording helped popularize the songs and RCA has kept it in circulation without interruption since 1951.The leads do not posess the most musical voices but they sound so right for the characters. The mens chorus gets to sing quite a bit and they sond properly robust. The recording has been laid out to include some bits of dialogue and these segments help give the disc some theatricality.The CD transfer has very good sound and comes with good background notes and a detailed synopsis.The boom for PAINT YOUR WAGON was the main problem which is why it has never been revived, but since the score contains such gems as ""I Talk to the Trees""; ""They Call the Wind Maria"" and ""Wand'rin' Star"" it would seem an ideal candidate for Encores or some other group that specializes in concert stagings of forgotten shows."
5,Worth adding to your Broadway collection,After all these years I finally got this album. The music is so good and the performance is typical Broadway. The sound still holds up. The price was right too.
5,This product stinks. BUT IT WORKS! :),"This is a great wood repair product. But you do have to remember to mix it up well like putty before using it. If you don't, it will not harden. It's in two parts, light and dark stuff. When you mix it, and put it in place, it'll smell like swamp gas, but that'll go away after while. ;)"
4,Great for vocabulary building and pronunciation practice,"Don't depend on this software to teach Bengali script or grammar. You should use it in conjunction with a grammar book. I use this and 101 Languages of the World mainly to practice pronunciation but also to build my vocabulary. You can click on a word over and over to hear the pronunciation. You can also record yourself and compare your pronunciation to that of the native speaker. The software focuses on basic vocabulary like numbers, colors, greetings, travel phrases, food, etc. It has games to reinforce learning.I like the fact that they show you each word written in Bengali script which helps with word recognition when I read Bengali. I highly recommend getting this and 101 Languages of the World. I am giving it 4 stars because they don't teach as many words as I would have liked. I estimate that there are about 400-500 words. But for the purposes of improving pronunciation it is worth it."
2,"Some value, but mostly disappointed","While I like the CD format and am impressed with its interactive features, I was mainly disappointed by this product. The vocabulary is quite limited, and also not very culturally appropriate. For example, I don't see myself going to Calcutta and asking where I can buy pizza, a hamburger, and a beer. Also it would be more useful to know how to say sari, blouse, and bindi, than shorts and tee-shirt. The lessons were also too focused on nouns and very few verbs (if any?) were taught. I did like the feature that allows you to record and compare your pronunciation, and the spellings were shown in Bengali script, which is good for those trying to develop their reading skills. Definitely need to supplement this product with other books."
5,This Melbourne boy will thrill you!!!!,"Josh Abrahams, wether it be through this release or his next, will be a triumphant success in the realm of drum'n'bass. His tracks are experimental and abstract yet all coherant and some super catchy like the single, ""Addicted To Bass."" This album will crawl under your skin and stay there for a long time.In my prediction, Josh Abrahams will be the first of many Melbourne based electro artisits to receive worlwide respect for dropping the bomb tracks.Trust me, the ground is shaking in Melbourne, the world just hasn't felt it yet. Let Josh Abrahams be your introduction."
1,It stinks--don't waste your money,I bought this because of Rolling Stone Mags' 5 star review. Obviously someone is getting a kickback. This collection really sucks. There is a reason so many of the songs were unfamiliar. They never received playtime nor should they have. There is a few of the good oldies but the vast majority of the songs are worthless. I got took but I will never buy another Nugget compilation. Save your money. There are much better compilations out there at a much cheaper cost. Physchedelia my ass. most of this stuff was bad bubblegum.
2,CD-RRRRR Best of 4 CD collection,I would give 5 stars for the music. Amazon is using old reviews from legit releases. CD-R at this price is outrageous. Most collectors probably have the 3 cd set or the 4 cd box or both. This may be good for someone hasn't heard any of this music but CD-R Come on!! Why go that cheap? We expect more from Amazon.
4,Superb,I bought this when it first came out on reputation alone. Each song has its charm. But of all the songs in my record collection perhaps the most unique is 'I live in the springtime' by The Lemon Drops. Totally cosmic man!
3,Forgotten songs remembered,"For me, as I was in my teens when these songs arised, this is a goldmine of memories. Tried this and that in those years with the music all around. Many of these tracks never found their way to Sweden though, but I enjoy listening to the typical sound of the times. A little disappointing that the tracks seem to be all mono(?). I am sure that there were some stereo tracks around at this time."
1,Interesting but Lo-Fi Collection,"This is an interesting collection but if you expect the best available recordings you will be disappointed. Rhino has used the mono versions that were used on 45rpm recordings for almost all of these selections. Many, if not most, of these recordings were also available in stereo versions from albums. Though the 45rpm record was an inherently superior technology, the 45s that I purchased in this era were always inferior to the stereo album versions that I purchased after I decided I wanted more of a groups work. The 45s were inferior in frequency range and the quality of the mastering. Even with a fairly good system (Sony DA 3300 ES receiver) these recordings sound like what came out of a 1960s era car radio. Too bad the product description didn't indicate that the selections were mono."
5,time warp,"Awsome collection of several well known favorites that get occasional airplay on oldies stations mixed with an abundance of tunes very rarely if ever heard- since I was there. Exposes younger listeners to more of the sound of the 60's and for those that were there, it brings it back. One of the best CD's I've ever heard."
5,best hard to find oldies I have found,This cd contains Hard to Find songs from the 60s. The sound is excellent. This cd is definately a must for Oldies collectors.
5,Review of Psychedelic Area Music CD,"This CD has some great songs on it, many of them obscure. Some of the garage bands' original songs sound like covers of tunes by the Beatles, Bob Dylan, etc. Some sound musically as good, if not better than the copied artists. I also found several musicians in these groups that went on to later play with groups who found much greater success in the music business."
2,60s Garage Bands with some Psychedelia,"The title of this box set might mislead someone into buying this thinking it will provide a good overview of the 60s psychedelic era. Actually it gives a decent picture of the GARAGE BANDS that existed during the era, but has very incomplete coverage of the pyschedelic music scene. I suggest listening to the Technicolor Web of Sound website to get a more realistic sample of 60s psychedelia. Of course, you will hear some of this box set's more psychedelic tunes there, but also alot more. (This box gives a good overview of the 60s psych/punk songs, so I'd recommend it to people who are seeking that, but keep in mind there's alot of garage rock mixed in.)"
5,Better Than Jagger,"It's all incredible. Period.The one drawback is having the great yet overplayed perrenial frat party faves (LOUIE LOUIE, WOOLY BULLY) crammed in with the lesser known/unknown tunes. it may have been better had Rhino organized these seperately, as a ""bonus disc.""... The second volume digs even deeper, with wondrous results."
3,What's Going On Here?,"What Rhino has done with this compilation is that they duplicated song for song Disc One of the Box Set. It would have been more representative if they would have taken 6 or 7 songs from each of the 4 CD's in the Box Set. They took the easy way out which I feel is really unfair to those buying the single CD. That aside, I can't argue with the quality, just the selections."
5,All American Kick but garage bands,"What most reviews miss is that these are ALL american bands. There are about 20 excellent cuts, the rest are sound alikes. Its worth every penny for those 20 songs. All drummers should note, for example, the awesome drumming on Talk Talk, it makes the song. These bands were made up of mostly traditionaly trained musicians, who discovered band music from first the AM radio and then freeform FM radio. I beleive that the vietnam war and draft put a big hole in the developement of these american bands into more than 1 hit wonders. The brits had no draft, no involvment in nam, they invaded the US with music. This excellent music, like Woodstock, could have happened only America, only at that time in history. Never to be repeated again."
3,"adorable decoration, but","adorable for tabletop, but holes are too large, so too much salt comes out, even when I put the salt in the 2 hole penguin & the pepper in the 3 hole penguin!"
5,I've seen 'em all: this is nicholson at his best.,"Review? Oh, I wouldn't call it that. An informed opinion, perhaps, or maybe a fan's commendation, but definitely not a review. I've seen all of the ""classic"" nicholson films one or more times, but this is the one that haunts me. It slaps me on the cheek when I'm not looking, and pinches my ass when I am. Part of this unpredictability stems from the outstanding performance of Lois Smith, a wonderful actress who makes me believe in siblinghood and family. Ultimately, however, Nicholson is at the heart of every Nicholson film, and ""Five Easy Pieces"" is no exception. The final scene is all. I won't whisper it away here, but it's definitely worth the price of the movie. In my opinion, ""Five Easy Pieces"" ranks among Jack's top three films."
2,"Iconic film-depressing, grim view of life","Nicholsan's performance is without a doubt superior, but the material is second-rate. Why anyone would want to make a movie like this, much less act in it, is beyond me. It depicts a bunch of self-obsessed and depressed people(unless they're two-dimensionally portrayed egotistical and superficial snobs to whom the depressed losers feel superior) doing stupid things and being nasty to one another. You just feel sad and frustrated after watching it, because it doesn't reflect life as it really is, or at the very least, it doesn't give a full view of life, just the small, mean, petty, grimy, sordid vision of one unhappy screenwriter who thinks they're being deep and insightful."
3,no longer the greatest,"though red hot when it came out in '70 (Nickolsons diner clip was the highlight of the academy awards), its dated characters, attitudes, and morals loose relevance today. Definitely a candidate for a successful remake."
2,Only for movie buffs,"This film is really only for movie buffs or historians. For a contemporary audience, there is little here that is redeeming or worthwhile. The culture has absorbed anything novel in this movie and moved on. Nicholson has done better work since this."
2,Very Overrated,"This wasn't very good. It wasn't very interesting. There was no real merit or redeeming quality to any of the characters. It wasn't an awful movie, but it leaves you wondering why anybody would ever bother making it. Nothing really stands out as singular or intriguing."
1,STANK! Total waste of some talented people.,"I am mystified as to why so many people think this film is so great. (But then, I feel the same way about ""Citizen Kane""!) Nicholson's character is a worthless, heartless, rude jerk from the beginning to the end, and all the other characters are either stupid and pathetic (like Karen Black's character and the oil-rig buddy) -- or totally boring, like Nicholson's character's family. I didn't think the chicken-salad-sandwich scene was all that thrilling, either. (In fact, I felt sorry for the waitress!) What a disappointment."
3,Great Perfomances but Dated Material,"Robert Dupea (Jack Nicholson) is living on the fringe of life. He is an oil field worker who likes to go with the boys and then go home to Rayette (Karen Black). Robert is happy with his existence and everything is fine. That is until he is told his father is dying and he needs to go home.This starts a memorable road trip with the most famous diner scene where Robert has a fight with a snotty waitress.Robert arrives home but leaves Rayette at the motel. We find out that Robert grew up in the upper middle class and is an accomplished pianist. Enter a new woman (Susan Anspach) who turns Robert's head and reminds him of what he left behind. When Rayette appears at the home, Robert's two lives collide.At the time, this was a cutting edge film but looking back it is very uneven with some great performances.DVD EXTRAS: None"
2,A pessimist dream...,"A pessimist dream of a movie. Maybe back in the seventies it was something to behold (I was in my thirties in the seventies so I don't remember it as so) but it certainly wasn't then and is not now, entertainment. The script is something the critics should have torn up and thrown in the proverbial fire pit. However, critics being what they usually are, negative on all sides, this was a dream movie for them. Suffice to say, you're on your own if you watch this film."
3,Five Easy Pieces and one hard guy to like,"""Five Easy Pieces"" is about a man who never got what he wanted. A guy who is trapped between two worlds and he can not find happiness in either. Of course we can feel for him. What bothers me is that he is so unrelentingly abusive, and he believes he is absolutely entitled to his behavior because things did not work out the way he planned. On the whole, ""Five Easy Pieces"" is a very good film, and Nicholson's performances is flawless, but I can't help but think the film would have been a little bit better had we gotten the man's softer side. No, I am not looking for some forced fluffy scenes to make him more sympathetic, not exactly. Rather, I want to see it so that I can recognize some basic decency in him."
2,Jim's Review,The service by the vendor was excellent but I did not enjoy this movie. The acting was just okay but I found myself getting bored with it.
4,Edited DVD from Original?,"I saw this movie when it first came out, and upon viewing it recently (2008), it appears to be different. I may be incorrect, but I remember it being in black and white, and I remember the confrontation with the character's father as being far more emotional and extended in time. Duprea said a great deal more to his father than - we never did talk much, did we? I think portions of the movie, which serve to give a much clearer picture of the relationship between father and son, have been edited out - to the detrement of artist and audience. Parents who dedicate their lives to solitary pursuits, however highly culturally valued, can run the risk of neglecting their children, leading to permanent emotional/psychological damage. Human beings are after all, social creatures, this being one message of this film."
5,Auspicious beginnings,"This is the best work (or as good a job as) Jack Nicholson, Karen Black, Susan Anspach, director Bob Rafelson, and writer Carol Eastman have ever done. Instead of seeming dated, it now just seems more universal than ever. Highest recommendation."
4,Five Easy Pieces,"Robert Dupea[Jack Nicholson] starts out being his normal tough guy andwoman chaser. The plot changes when he meets Susan Anspach and fallsfor her, making him change is idea about women. This seems hard forJack to do. Overall this is a good movie, but a bit slow at times."
1,"even if you enjoy being treated as if you were 4, its still not worth it.","Eurotalk apparently uses the same vocabulary lists and activities for its entire foreign language series. This Amharic CD-Rom teaches you such essential words as ""teddy bear"" and ""raspberry"", neither of which are terribly common in Ethiopia, while neglecting ""injeera"" and ""chick peas"" &c.; Also, the vocab word comes up in Ge'ez script, but no transliteration is made avaliable. In fact, there are no script lessons at all on this CD-Rom.Also for the vocabulary, two humans, resembling the most obnoxious of ESL teachers, on the screen act as if they are saying the words, but simply mouth some random muted utterance. It is annoying and distracting (imagine the word ""strawberry"" articulated while a man mouths ""car"" while moving around herky-jerky style and uncontrolably blinking). Better to spend the extra money on the Appleyard CD/Book combo. Please believe me."
3,Could be improved,"Let's face it - there aren't many options available for someone wishing to learn basic Amharic. And after using this product for a while, you'll certainly know more Amharic than you started with. It's a worthwhile purchase as long as you aren't expecting too much out of it.I do think it could be improved, though. In particular I would take issue with some of the choices of vocabulary it teaches - there are words and phrases which would be useful but don't appear, as well as some that just seem unnecessary. This is especially so in the ""phrases"" section, and it isn't helped by the fact that some of these phrases are so long and complicated that the odds of a basic student memorising them seem remote at best.And the customer service is TERRIBLE, so you'd better hope you don't get a defective CD.Until something better comes along though, this will do for the basic traveller."
3,Silly Songs,"Mancini was all about fun. This album captures his most whimsical contributions.He also compsoed some of the most haunting and romantic songs we ever got too. However, the emphasis here is on comedy and fun, and it's most, most welcome.Enjoy and laugh! Appeals to children of all ages, as they say."
4,Very entertaining for a bargain book.,"Very entertaining throughout, an exciting read although it drags a bit in some places, but enjoyable nonetheless. It seems as if something like this could happen, people getting caught up in the reappearance of Christ without question."
4,It had a great plot .Have never read anything like it .,I thought this was a very well written book . It kept my attention through most of it . I could picture the descriptions of places and people and could even smell some of it . Mr DeMers knows how to draw a picture from words and I would like to read more of his novels. The story made me want to keep turning pages.
3,The cure for insomnia,"This book gives near complete coverage of developing Windows NT drivers and towards the end of the book covers Windows 2000 driver development. A beginning driver developer, I found this book somewhat hard to follow, as it reads very much like a product manual. It does however relay alot of valuable information. I found this bookThe Windows 2000 Device Driver Book: A Guide for Programmers (2nd Edition)to be much easier to follow."
5,Excellent,"If you write or work with W2K device drivers, this is the book for it. As a bonus, the writing is much more colorful than most development books. I highly recommend it."
3,Developing Windows NT Device Drivers,"No good for windows 2000 or XP, otherwise very good and informative. Code available from authors sites, but buggy (on XP anyway). Shame it's out of date, if a legacy driver will do you then this book is very good."
2,Poor Style and No Code Download/Disk - Still Somewhat Useful,"This book is a useful reference for the NT/Win2k driver developer, but it has a number of disappointing flaws which make it less practical.The authors attempt to be humorous by making frequent sarcastic remarks and the general tone is very informal--inappropriate for a developer's handbook. The book also appears to be poorly proofread, as some sentences don't parse and there are typographical errors in printed code. All these stylistic errors make the book much more difficult to use, as it takes more time and effort to locate and absorb the important content.The book does not include a disk or CD with source code printed in the text, and the authors' web site includes code for only a small minority of the programs mentioned in the book. If you want to try out the examples, you'll be spending a lot of time typing.On the whole, this book is useful, but I recommended it only until a better-written text is available."
2,Pretty dull,"The worst thing about this CD is that most songs are alike and you don't realise when one ends and the other begins as they all sound the same. The best song is Au Haut Du Mat. L'assistant Parlementair is also quite good. i always skip the first two songs though. Obviously, the other reviewers disagree with me. The CD is full of guitar and the singer more reads the lyrics than sings them. So i would rate the CD as ""cautious, please be careful""."
4,Well Worth It,"Most Bargain book stores now sell this book for about 5.99. Spanning time, it offers insight into all the major statements of faith throughout history without a great deal of commentary. If you are worried about the book having any particular denominational slant, it doesn't seem to show, and I'm writing as a Catholic apologist. If you can get it for a discount, go for it. Great reference title."
2,"laymen, do not try this at home","It's possible this is a great book for theologians to read from cover to cover but I don't have the credentials to judge that and this book has little value to anyone else.From the description, I believed I would easily be able to look up the different creeds and understand the basic philosophies. This is simply not possible. The book is laid out in a time line approach and not indexable by creed. It's also a massive book with a lot of dry, arcane information so a cover to cover read won't appeal to the casual reader."
4,Great guide for Yelowstone and Surrounding Area,I highly recommend this book. This author provides great history along with useful information in enjoying the park. There is a logical division of areas within the park and she references you to the next map(location) at the end of each discussion. It is an easy to use reference. She gives information about the surrounding towns and immediate areas outside of each park entrance which decreases the need for additional guide books. I highly recommend this book.
4,Very useful,"This is a good book to have with you in Yellowstone. I especially liked the road logs. It is a good resource that brings together information that would otherwise need to be gathered from multiple resources and is sometimes not even available elsewhere. Combined with T. Scott Bryan's ""The Geysers of Yellowstone"", it was very well used on our trip!"
4,Beautiful book,Highly recommend this book. Well written explaination of what you are seeing. Much better than the park service materials.
4,Good place holder until new episodes air,"The best way to describe these new LOST novelizations is to compare them to a bag of potato chips: tastey, but over-all not that satisfying. Yes as a fan of the show I'm interested in knowing about ALL the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815, and I know I'll read the next book to come out just like I read the past two, however the extremely short length of the books tend to leave one feeling unsatisfied. The pattern of alternating between life after the crash and flashbacks is a nice nod to the show, but like the last book, things just seem to feel rushed. I realize I haven't said anything about the actual plot of the book, but to be honest, that's really not necessary. If you are a fan of the show, you will most likely pick this book up. If you aren't, don't waste your money."
2,Better read the safety booklet of a plane,"Let me tell you that this booklet is definitely worthless. You can read it in maybe three hours but that doesn't mean that is a good book. On the other hand it doesn't even had an end. When you'll finish you'll be exactly as when you started reading it, exactly with nothing at all because this book says nothing."
4,Review By Joshua Inman,I loved it. Every other chapter was about Dexter's life on the island and every other chapter is about Dexter's life before crashing on the island. You know you love the book when after each chapter you don't want to read about either being on the island or back home cause what you just read was so good you want to keep following that specific storyline. Cathy Hapka is awesome!
2,Terribly boring,"Not recommended for those who are looking for more form the series. It does not have the same spirit at all (independently from the the fact that the characters are not the same ones, which should be good)..."
5,Good book.,"I love this show, its the best on TV. I've also found this book to be very good also. Now I'm going back and watching all the seasons over to find secrets and clues that I may have missed.One of the things LOST introduced me to was the Twilight Zone which J.J. Abrams was inspired. Besides this book, I recommend one other also on Amazon.com. THE TWILIGHT ZONE: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic by Martin Grams. Together, both books open the skies for cult television."
1,Outrage! Best tunes left off of th CD!,"Warning: the CD titled ""Inner Visions"" is NOT the orginal album on vinyl, despite the cover art. After a long wait for this title to be released on CD, I grabbed a copy as soon as it became available. I took it home and played it only to be shocked that some of the best tunes were left off the CD, an outrageous perversion in a day when many CDs are released with added tracks. I was especially upset that ""Tones for Joan's Bones"" was missing. The only reason I give this product even one star is for ""Litha."" To charge money for only part of an album, without identifying the album as incomplete, and using original cover art to suggest that it is the genuine article, is THEFT -- a crime! The bad rating is for the false product, not Chick Corea's effort."
5,Chick's Best Collection Ever,"Although the transfer from vinyl missed two stellar compositions(available on an album with McCoy, Herbie, and Keith Jarrett) there is some absoluteky marvelous stuff on this disc that hits most of the conceivable bases of what jazz can be. Some avant-garde exploration, some ballad music, some chamber music sounding stuff--all of it combines to give a satisfying pastiche of the jazz experience. It's on my top 15 list for several reasons--the playing is excellent, his various ensembles never fail to coalesce harmonically, and there's some genuine integrity of expression here. It both pleases and challenges, and I truly regret that is it not more widely known or highly regarded. I think it's a classic."
3,"Good combination, but better recordings are available","This disc is a good combination of famous Hollywood marches and makes for enjoyable listening all the way through. That said, there are better recordings of most of these marches available, although probably not together. If you like marches, this is a good disc to just listen to, or to use as a sort of ""sampler."" If you realy like any of the marches on this disc, however, better versions are mostly available in the soundtrack(s) for the respecive movies."
4,Great for Home/Office,"I bought one of these a few months ago for my office at work....perfect for setting on the desk and being able to connect to XM. It's not the most powerful speaker system, but, it works great.Like it so much, had to buy another for home....you just can't beat it for the price!!!I'd recommend it for anyone looking for a in-expensive boom-box. (Also works for the Skyfi 3)...."
5,Altec Lansing XM3120 Docking System,"This worked just great with my XM Xpress EZ tuner. It fit in one of the docks with absolutely no modifications. It sounds just great and you don't even need the antenna pointed through an outside window. I have it pointed South right at a sheet rock wall and it works excellently! Two criticisms though; one, it took me a while to figure out how to power OFF the unit. You need to press and hold the XM button on the radio itself for a couple of seconds, and two, there is no battery capability as with the older boom box units but that is just fine with me since I use this in the house."
4,Great for the price--sound quality okay,"For the price--this is a great value and works great. I wish I'd spent more and got better sound quality though. Also, all the cords and antennae involved is messy and cumbersome to move around. If price is your goal, get it. If looks and sound quality are more important--spend more money."
5,A must have...,"Excellent device.....Its got a superb sound quality if you live in a Apartment....I wish it has remote and power button, Overall im happy with the purchase."
5,Great sound for a fantastic price,"This product delivers on sound. I haven't had any problems with it, the sound clarity is great and no problems picking up a signal."
4,X-M indoors,This product works fine for my elderly ears however the younger generations might like more volumn
1,Not what I expected,"This item did not work with the Express R unit I purchased. I was led to believe it worked for the entire Express family, but this is not the case. My unit would not fit in. I was very hopefuly as the price was great and it was what I was looking for. Amazon did process a no hassle return."
2,Sounds Bad,Poor sound quality. I thought Altec Lansing would do a better job. I also have the Belkin Audio System BOOM BOX for RoadyXT and Xpress Radios and it sounds 10x better.
1,Very Happy,Great price and it is so easy to use. Max volume is not very loud but it is fine for me. Don't expect to be able to hear this through the whole house.
3,"Low Volume, lots of cables, always on","This docking system works perfectly well with my Delphi Roady XT. My main complaints are- there isn't a built-in antenna (which some can see as a plus because it allows you to rig up the antenna closer to the window) but to me, it's adding a LOT of clutter to have a wired antenna.- there's no way to physically turn it off without unpluggin it. I cannot leave things ""on"" at work when I'm not here, and it's tedious to have to actually unplug the thing instead of flipping a switch. I don't see the benefit of this ""ready"" mode.- The volume, in general, seems low to me. We placed the unit in one room and assumed we could crank it up to hear it in a connecting room, but the volume was way way too low."
3,Great sound quality,Great bargain- the only thing that I didn't realize when I purchased the product was that it was not interchangeable with the antenna that I was previously using from my boom box so a modification of the plastic casing where the antenna plugs in was required.There is great sound quality for all the bigger the unit is.I would recommend purchasing this if you are looking for a space saving unit to play your xm in.
2,Owner,"The item is defective. I am unable to adjust the sound. The unit is new and is other wise great., but the sound can not be adjusted. Don't know if the seller was aware of this."
4,works great!!!!,"The package arrived earlier than stated. It works great....will not work in my office due to coating on windows, so am enjoying it at home."
4,Works better than advertised,"Even though the description did not expressly indicate that it can accomodate the XpressEZ Model, I took a chance. Voila! It fits and functions just fine. The tone quality is ok and the volume output is far greater than its size would lead you to expect.Audiovox Car XMCK5 XpressEZ Satellite Radio Receiver w/ SureConnect"
2,"Be Very Very Quiet, I'm listening to the Radio...","After reading all of the reviews on this (and disregarding those who said it was too quiet) I thought I would take a chance and buy it. It is really a nice looking unit, but it is SO light and feels cheap. Turned up full blast you can barely hear it from the next room. I wish I would have went for the bigger ""boom box"" style. So, if you want a docking station for your XM reciever for a small room, this would be a good buy, but if you need ""punch"" to deliver volume for noisy areas I would certainly go for a more powerful unit."
5,Satisfied Customer,"An extremely spacious, durable, and affordable bag. I was very impressed with the beauty of this product and the amount of compartments that it has. I use it to carry my laptop, mouse, webcam, digital camera and alot of other supplies that I may need for my classes. I would highly recommend this product as the best buy. If you're thinking about purchasing this bag go ahead, i'm sure you will be 100% satisfied."
3,Good book! Lots of details!!,"The book is rather long for the CNA test, but very, very good details about commands in Novell. Exercises where O.K. I can't stand crosswords, but if you like crosswords this book is for you. Passed the CNA exam the first time! Good luck if you take the exam!"
3,There are better out there,"This study guide is a complete resource and would benefit anyone. However, there are better and more inexpensive resources out there. Like the free practice test on the prometric website. And the study guide and materials package at http://www.cna-test-coach.com/cna-study-guide you can find free printable flashcards on the same site."
2,Novell's CNA Study Guide for NetWare 5,"I have the edition written by David James Clarke, IV. I really dislike this book because the author uses too much filler. He doesn't get straight to the point. Instead of explaining how to perform various functions in the simplest fashion, Clarke blathers on with his nature analogies."
4,Nice-but side screws,Nice product but side screws difficult to install in tight places-especially the nuts inside the side screws.
3,Nice small Lights for tight spaces,"Lights are pretty well made and they do a decent job considering they are only a 3"" lens size. Not bright enough if you are looking for lights designed for off road use."
5,Computer Helper,"Holding papers while I type on my laptop was a problem until I found this neat little item. It packs well in the laptop case and is easily attached to the open screen for use. If you want to use it more than just occasionally, it can be attached permanently."
2,"Fine performances, terrible picture quality","This DVD contains great performances, however the picture qulaity is so poor that you have the feeling you are wathcing a weak TV broadcast with a broken set of rabbit ears."
2,Qualitative Design,"Was stated to be in good condition, but the front cover was torn off and that wasn't stated in the description. Poorly done!"
5,Qualitative Research Design : An Interactive Approach (Applied Social Research Methods),The book was delivered on time and the quality of the book is great.
5,Very good book,"This is an awesome book. I love how everything is easy to understand. I love the way the author laid out the details and explained concepts. The examples are very helpful & so are the diagrams. Also, the fact that the book is small makes it approachable even though some of the material may be challenging. I would recommend this book to both students learning qualitative design for the first time and professors who want a good book for their students."
5,Insightful and laid out in a way to guide and challenge your design process.,"The book combines methodology, paradigms and exercises in order to force creative and reflective thinking about a persons personal design process. It is not just about design, but about the fundamentals of knowledge construction and qualitative research. Maxwell is an excellent writer and is able to capture arguments and difficult concepts in a lay, but stimulating way."
1,NOT as pictured,"Dissapointing! This product arrived and is nothing like the photo. Its a half inch thick, smooth on one side only, and not nearly as comfortable as it looked in the photo. The origianal price said $200 and now its $167? Save your money and buy from a store where you can see what youre REALLY getting."
2,Poor ergonomics make this a looser!,While this is a good looking product it has a fatal design flaw. The edge of the light has a piece of plastic that is visible from the side. The problem is that even when the light is pointed down at the keyboard you'll see the bright edge of the light and no matter how you position it the glare is bliding in low light situations (which is the only time you need the damned thing). A piece of electric tape will solve the problem but I'd suggest you look at another model.
2,Doesn't provide enough light.,"It bends fairly well and does provide light. However, it provides so little light that I could not use it to read a book in a semi-dark room. The area of its light is so small that it really is not of much help to illuminate a keyboard."
2,Not what I was looking for,"First of all, I did not notice this is a 2006 book so its a bit outdated. Then when I started looking through it, I noticed it only has 24 colleges in it. I thought it would at least have all the CSU schools but it only has 2 of them. That is where this book is terrible. If I knew I was only gonna get 24 schools, I would have just went with the Fiske Guide to Colleges.The only thing that is good about this book, it does go into some detail to those select 24 schools. Other than that, the book isn't worth it."
3,It's ok,"I was hoping to find the different majors and programs that each of the schools have in this book, but was really disappointed. All it has is whether a school has good parking, good looking guys and girls or good food. The only interesting part is the community the school is located in. Otherwise it was a letdown."
1,Don't trust College Prowler,"When I met with my academic advisor to discuss the college guide books I had been reading, she warned me that College Prowler is considered a reputable source of information by neither her nor any of her colleagues in academe.Sure enough, when I came to Amazon just now to sell my two used College Prowler books, I noticed that shortly after each book had been published, a single person had submitted a five-star review for both books. In one review, he stated he's ""from the East Coast,"" and in the other review he stated he's ""from the Pacific Northwest.""It looks like my academic advisor was correct about College Prowler."
1,"THERE ARE ALMOST FOURTY EPISODES, AND I GET FOUR ,THANKS","X-Men Evolution rocks, dvd rocks, I think that these four episodes are the begining of the second season.1-Growing pains2-Bada-bing bada-boom3-Power surge4-Fun and gamesyes, these are great episodes, but why can't i get ahold of theones from the first season? as you can tell I'm very disapointed."
2,"Watch the cartoon on tv, not worth buying",Evolution....Its just a lame remake of the original which was the best. Its all too modernized and too kiddy cartoon. Everyting has been modified for the lil kids. I recommend the old 90's xmen. I dont knwo why they dont put out more expisodes on dvd.
2,This is a very dumb cartoon.,I liked the 90s X-Men series. This has some of the characters from the comics but it's mostly all a bunch of characters who arn't in the comics. It doesn't have Gambit in it and it doesn't have Jubilee. If you're an X-Men fan don't get this.
4,exactly what I ordered,"I ordered this to help with my yoga. It did exactly this, but it is for novice yoga goers so if you want to borrow one from a friend I would recommend that first."
4,"The Vicar: Fun, Fat, and Forty","Anyone who enjoyed the British series ""Vicar of Dibley"" should enjoy the specials and extras on this DVD. The Vicar herself has gained weight, and Alice looks a bit old to be the resident dingbat, but the cast continues to entertain, reprises just enough of the series' recurring elements, and adds to the overall story of the woman vicar who, against great odds, becomes the beloved servant of a crazy but endearing community. The humor is sometimes irreverant but always entertaining."
2,Vicar's 10th anniversary a disappointment,"As a Brit and an avid ""Vicar"" fan, I was very disappointed in the 10th anniversary special. Generally, it has lost its clever innocence and wackiness and Alice is far too self aware as an actor. She's also lost her naive sweetness. It just wasn't funny and bears none of its original surprise and appeal.Having said that, I watch the series over and over again--it's brilliant!"
1,Ehhh...not so good...,"After loving all the ""Dibley"" series and specials and even traveling to Turville, where they filmed the exteriors for the series, I eagerly awaited the new specials. I thought it would be wonderful to see the whole gang reunited, but all I felt was a massive wave of disappointment.The characters are more cariactures and do not act as they should: I'm sorry, but Geraldine sticking her whole HEAD into a chocolate fountain? Not something she would do. The cup of chocolate, yes. The ""baptism by Cadbury""? Not her at all. Alice and Hugo offering a threesome to Geraldine? Nuh-uh. Nope. No way.Buy these ONLY if you're a die-hard fan, like me. As it is, however, I doubt I'll be watching these again unless the rest of my ""Dibley""s get destroyed. I'm sad that Richard Curtis sank so low."
4,A very Merry Christmas indeed,"It's always a pleasure to go back and visit dear friends. No exception here.Sure, the crowd in Dibley is getting a bit long in the tooth, but at least in the first episode, they have not lost their edge. I watched this episode with some close friends and we just roared with laughter with the familiar antics of the wacked out Dibley crowd.The Christmas episode is a worthy end to the series and a high point.The New Year's episode falls short with a well intentioned but forced bow to Live Aid, which is a bit too heavy handed and, frankly, dated for a series like this. At this point, the characters actions become strained and the situations are funny but not up to the previous episodes high points. However, who can fault Ms French for using her program's good name to fight a worthy cause?Buy this CD for the holiday episode and enjoy the extra behind the scenes clips as a delightful bonus."
4,Adult humor and very funny,This irreverent series has a cult following in England but the plots may be difficult for some Americans to follow due to the copious use of English-style 'double meanings'. For those who 'give it a go' I think you will be pleasantly surprised.
1,Don't waste your money on this product...,"This product is not worth buying. The sound only lasts about 3 weeks. And, if it gets wet, or damp (probably will since it goes on the window), then it doesn't work the same anymore. Also, the bar has to be aligned PERFECTLY otherwise the alarm will sound. After opening and closing your window a few times, the bar will no longer be perfectly aligned. And, your alarm will sound. Really just a piece of junk- Get ADT if you need an alarm that seriously."
4,This is the one book to buy to learn Japanese.,"If you want to be able to say what's on your mind in Japanese, this would be the book to buy. The Hugo ""three months"" series is the best I've found to comprehensively understand most grammar and vocabulary you'd find in normal conversation.While other series require you to buy serveral books, beginning-intermediate-or advanced, you can work through all three levels at you own pace in this single book. It's intense, but more satisfying than your average language course.You won't be fluent in 3 months, but you'll know the language well enough that people will think you've been living in Japan much longer."
3,"Definitely NOT for ""in the car"" study","The depth of material covered in this set is great, HOWEVER, I quickly discovered that this set is NOT for listening to in the car. That's the reason why I got it and this set just flat out REQUIRES you to read the book. After Chapter 1 on the tapes they basically just stop giving out definitions and explanations for things. There's still some degree of English in it, but it's mostly just to lead into the next chapter/section/exercise.Seems like it would be a good set to study Japanese as long as you can read along with the book and don't need to have ""both hands on the wheel."""
3,Digital Business book review,I purchased this book as a requirement for a college class. This book is very outdated but gives some good basic information. I would not recommend this book unless it is a required reading. Look for something that is more current regarding technology.
1,"Mr. Crane, NO thank you!","Rarely does one read a book with such poor grammar or ill-usedpunctuation (the misuse of semi-colons throughout is nothing short of spectacular). I cannot imagine who edited Mr. Blossingham's copy, but I fear they were doing something else more important at the same time ... This book is not about Arcadia, Michigan, at all, but about an improbable, contradictory young man and his contrived 'adventures'. Reading the entire book requires a herculean effort, though it is rather like a lurid auto accident - you know you shouldn't gawk but you can't seem to stop yourself. This reader's advice: save your [money] for a few drinks at the Big Apple Bar in Arcadia. That is where you'll meet the real characters and participate in far more intelligent conversation."
1,Movie?? Forget it!,"Reading this book was a complete waste of time. I kept at it thinking it might get better, but it never did. The story-line is sophomoric, and grammar and sentence structure is akin to that of a third grade writer. Supposedly set in Arcadia, Michigan, I could find few references to Arcadia which were accurate. This was a disappointing purchase and I cannot recommend it to my friends."
1,This is dreadful stuff,"Before this author ever wastes his time and money on another self-publishing (iuniverse.com publishes anything by anybody for a fee) effort he needs to listen to a few suggestions: First, he might have a good idea for a short story in this book, but there is no reason for him to stretch it into a tedious and boring novella, as he has done. Second, he needs a good editor, as I assume he published this book without one. His grammar is so poor it is distracting to any reasonably intelligent reader. This is doubly troublesome because his narrative is often so disjointed on its own, even without the grammatical flaws. He has sold many books in the Arcadia area based on the book's setting there, but because this one is so awful, a repeat of that success is unlikely."
3,Worked great for years,"I love the direct launch buttons. The ball mechanism innards work beautifully when not dirty. I had no complaints other than having to clean it frequently. BUT, it developed a problem common to them and I was no longer able to move the cursor vertically. I followed online blog suggestions. Took it apart. Cleaned every crevice and cranny twice and reassembled it. Didn't work so I'm opting for the optical version (7) which we use on another computer. It doesn't have the direct launch buttons but is dirt free and tracks beautifully. The scroll ring works better. Sadly, I had to throw this one away. Great features but seriously flawed when compared with later technology. The Kensington Orbit Optical 64327 is an inexpensive version to consider. Moderately priced it is equally smooth and has three functions you can program into it."
2,"Nothing great, but cheap.","Not bad for the twenty seven cent price tag, but if one were to spend more than 4 dollars on this album, I would call them frivolous. Basically, you can't buy a c.d. for a quarter and expect to discover the new Zeppelin. Forest Ranger is pretty cool, and Roller Rock Cam is decent, but other than that the album sort of sounds like a fifty minute song. Its real easy to get tired of. I dont regret buying it, but thats only because it was cheap as dirt."
5,plexi-the legend that is,"Just saw the triumphant return of Plexi last night at the Dragonfly in L.A.Welcome back boys.Though it was only a one time reunion it was worth the wait.They still got IT! That voice,the swirling headrush of the guitars,the driving incessant rhythms.Nobody gives you the goosebumps like these guys.Here's looking foward to their future endeavors.The major labels should be kicking themselves for their loss! We Angelenos love you guys!"
4,It's come to this...,"It seems against the laws of physics for a used music store not to carry a copy of this album...quick find the suckers that will buy a second one for more than a buck!In all seriousness, Plexi's debut stands as a perfect example of 'what the hell happened' and a perfect reminder of precisely what can happen: You can have everything together, and still end up being sold for a quarter.Perhaps I'm too sympathetic, but even though I wouldn't travel far to see a reunion, they were better than most radio play ever since, some nice artsy ether in their garage rock. It's also possible that all the mid-90s failures who confirmed the death of the early 90s are just so gloriously painful to behold. At the very worst we could have another example of:If you wear makeup...you better not sound like you wear torn blue jeans.(Sigh)Unless you play wretched pop-punk, than is."
3,not bad but not great...,"Roller rock cam is the best song on the cd, that one line will get stuck in your head for the rest of the day. Star star will Cheer you up if your depresed, you have to listen to it. Most of the other songs are OK with a few filler tracks thrown in there."
5,Joyce Chen garden scissors,"These are very comfortable, very handy garden scissors, just right for cutting flowers, deadheading, etc."
3,berry ok,"I like the design, look and sharpness. They are comfortable to grip and use repeatedly whilst pruning, however, they are stainless steel and they rust. I don't like that one bitnuff said"
2,Didn't work,"Need it to separate a piece form my windshield wiper, basically this thing couldn't do it just kept slipping off. Never used it for Gear pulling so I can't comment on if it actually works for that, but this is what was recommended to but to complete what I needed to do, but failed."
4,Austin gets started,"this is a good dvd if you are a fan of wrestling of the 1980to 1990s this is a Austin dvd but it is also a good look at what was going on in wrestling in Dallas back in those day before WWE took it all away from us would be nice to see a dvd on more of the wrestling stars from that time only thing I did,t like was the audio on my dvd it keeps going from one side to the other not to good should stay on stereo!"
4,The Road To Hell Is Paved With Good Intentions,"The Butterbox Babies is a deep film. The characters are clearly so well meaning as they start their home for unwed mothers, but slowly over the film they are corrupted by money and expedience.You as the viewer, tend to stay sympathetic, until bit by bit you realise how corrupt they have become. You feel unclean for having sympathised with them so long. It is a heartbreaker of a movie.It shows that the choice is not between abortion and no abortion, but between abortion and illegal abortion."
3,Less than Expected,"The story line had possibilities but fell short of my expectations given the subject matter. Not a bad movie, just not all that intriguing."
2,Didn't like it,"I watched the movie and nearly got sick half way through. How anybody could make a picture like that. It was awful! I wish now I hadn't of bought it. It is going into either the trash or given to a thrift store. Maybe someone else might enjoy it, but I sure didn't!!!"
4,Quiet and charming,"A young woman Jessica, leaves her home for life in Paris, and finds work as a cafe waitress in the theater district. Her job may not pay much, but she's surrounded by fascinating and sophisticated customers, some very well known. Avenue Montaigne is a gentle but engaging portrayal of a slice in the lives of 6 of them, all of whom are on the edge of making life altering decisions. In the process, Jessica's life as an adult begins, enriched by the experiences of those around her. The ensemble cast was well selected and performs well, and the stories are well told and seamlessly integrated. As it's set in Paris, it isn't necessary to comment upon the scenery. This is a shamelessly feel-good movie for adults, the sort that isn't made in America these days, filled with decency and humor."
3,I wish I had rented it instead.,"The film was simple yet agreeable. However, I am disappointed that I will not be able to show this film in my French classroom due to the language and content. Even if the film was ""cleaner,"" I'm afraid that my students would be bored with the slow and simple plot."
3,Pleasant time waster,"Country waif Jessica (Cecile de France) moves to Paris and lands a waitress job that allows her to flit about on the fringes of the art world, where she learns that artists are human just like the rest of us. This film is well-made, well-acted, and completely inconsequential. Recommended for Francophiles."
1,worthless to us.,It was not clear from description that this DVD does not work on American equipment! A total loss to us!
1,Don't buy this book for vacation planning!,"We bought this book only because the Moon Handbook was unavailable. We hoped to use this as a vacation planner. The book appears to have lots of information, but for us, interested in tent camping and hiking, with some in-town activities, the information was largely irrelevant. Things worth dwelling on--such as Spearfish Canyon--are mentioned with much less emphasis than the exhaustive coverage of shopping facilities, for example. The text is incessantly cheery and reads like a school newsletter. We would have preferred the intelligent critical evaluation that makes the Moon books such great reading--and such great resources."
4,Good hard case,"I recently purchased an M500, and purchased this case to use on it. I use my PDA for paperless geocaching, and need a hard case since I'm taking it out into the outdoors, including rain (since I live in the Pacific Northwet). This case is nice and solid. The closing mechanism is effective, using two magnets to hold it closed. It's also lined with fabric to cushion blows. It also covers the PDA completly, unlike the case for my Palm Vx. However, this means that I cannot access the stylus without opening the case. It also lacks a pocket for a business card, which I have contact info on in case I lose the PDA while in the field. It is useful with several models, as well, unlike the case I have for my Palm Vx, which is why I purchased this one.Pros:Solid caseLined to cushion blowsGood closing mechanism, simple and efficentFully enclosedUseful with multiple models, including the Palm VxCons:No pocket for business cardCannot access stylus with case closed"
4,Simply rocking,"I had never heard of James Kinne till he played at my school in upstate NY. In one day he did 2 shows during alumni weekend. One knows how a show will be based upon the first couple of songs. He came out smoking, with "" Reach Down "" and then with "" Better Things "". The power and presence that he had got a room full of students, faculty and alumni keenly listening and ending each song with a loud applause. He then changed the pace with playing "" Angel Eyes "" and a track "" Anywhere but Here "" from his previous band Chasing Grey. His albumn is one of the better discs i have heard in the past year or two. He has a sound that is simply amazing, lyrics that can touch everyone in some way. Great live performer whether alone or with his band."
5,I LOVE MY GRIND AND BREW!,"I've had my Thermal Grind & Brew for 2 years and LOVE IT! Most of my friends have the same model and share my feelings about this great machine. I have to say that I do NOT agree with the bad reviews I've read... not in the least!The coffee is delicious and the process is quick and easy. We use paper filters in ours - my husband's preference. This is a 10 cup coffee maker and there's plenty of room for all the beans. As for clean up ... it's a breeze. We put all of the parts in the dishwasher and wipe down the exterior of the machine - takes less than 30 seconds. I thoroughly clean the interior parts every few months. Again, it's easy and takes less than 5 minutes.Yes, the grind process is loud but lasts only a few seconds.The thermal model is the only way to go! Your coffee stays hot and fresh for hours with NO burn flavor.I highly recommend the Thermal Grind and Brew. LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!"
1,What a mess!,"We've had this coffee maker for a while. Once it a while the basket containing the ground coffee pops part way open while brewing. The result? Hot coffee and grinds all over the coffee maker, the counter and the floor. A ten minute cleanup. Not a pleasnt surprise when you come down for your morning coffee. We've resorted to taping the basket shut while looking for replacement."
3,The good and the bad of it.,"Stylish, sleak and complete. When I was in the market for a new coffemaker, the features, design and Cuisinart reputation attracted me right to this machine. However, one critical element to the best cup of coffee is lacking. The thermal pot just doesn't keep the coffee hot. After about 45 minutes the best you'll get is luke warm, over an hour its tepid and much over that its down right cold. Not exactly the ""keep thecoffee hot for hours."" promised in the user manual. Unfortunately, there's not much you can do about it either since the machine automatically shuts off immediately after completing the brewing cycle.On a lighter note, the clean up process is no where near as drastic as mentioned by some other reviewers. A clean pot is a necessity for a great cup of coffee and this particular unit, is extremely well designed to allow easy removal of all critical parts for quick and thorough cleaning. I also love the fact the machine has a water filter."
2,A Pain,"We purchased this product Nov. 2004. The basket has consistantly popped open, either while grinding or while brewing. Today, I stood by it while it grinded & pretty much finished brewing, I thought. I took the garbage out, came in & coffee was all over the counter, yet again. The first time we set the alarm clock & woke up to coffee all over the counter & down the newly painted, white cabinets, ugh! I can't believe I've waited so long to be this frustrated & done with this machine. I think it's because we paid so much for the coffee maker when it first came out. I'll check reviews & get a different machine."
4,"Wonderful product, awkward to clean.","This coffee maker is wonderful. It grinds the coffee beans then brews the coffee all by itself. With the thermal carafe you don't have to worry about burnt coffee like on a hotplate. It is a little loud when it grinds the beans, but that is to be expected. Also it is very awkward trying to clean all the parts. Overall, it is worth the effort for great, fresh coffee."
1,There is a special place in product hell for this appliance,"So many bad things to say, and so little time. First off, the coffee reservoir is woefuly inadequate, unless you drink coffee so weak expressly to avoid it having any flavor. It randomly decides to spray coffee all over the counter with no warning, the grinder is louder than can be possibly justified, so forget early morning auto brew unless you have a a soundproof kitchen, and the most disturbing thing, the steam from the brewing chamber travels up the grinder chute, dampens the coffee, leeching it of flavor and turning it into sludge. If the best part of waking up is Folgers in your cup, this may be the machine for you, however if you actually like your coffee to have any flavor, don't even CONTEMPLATE buying this machine."
2,brewing 'defect',"Great grind and brew EXCEPT that the basket component pops open while brewing and the coffee leaks all over the counter. I have contacted Cuisinart and have told them about this problem. They suggested that I should wash it better. I wash it after each use. The locking mechanism for the basket is very very difficult to reach and thus very hard to clean. I guess I am not cleaning it well enough, although i don't see how i can clean it any better. I don't recommend this coffee maker."
2,The one flaw can't be ignored,"Yes the thermal carafe is wonderful and keeps the coffee hot and fresh tasting. Yes the grinder is very loud but who really cares. Yes it makes a delicious cup of coffee. And YES it periodically without warning clogs up in the middle of brewing and you wind up with coffee all over the counter. We don't even use the grinder anymore, thinking that might be the problem but it still clogs. We thoroughly wash every component before every pot of coffee that we make and that doesn't keep it from clogging. We have the coffee ground in a medium grind just in case it was too fine and that might be the problem....to no avail...it STILL about 1 in every 10-12 pots makes a gigantic mess. I cannot recommend this machine."
4,We like it,"So far this coffeemaker has been great, no problems yet. We bought one for my parents a couple of years ago and they are still enjoying it also. The programming function is great. It is a bit of a pain to clean, but the last one we had was worse.Oh, one note, do not forget to put in a filter - either the gold one or another - very messy if you don't.So, overall we really like it."
3,DGB-600 vs DGB-300,"A good machine with its own quirks. We ""upgraded"" from a Cuisinart DGB-300. My comparison of the 600 to the 300:PROS: no hot plate in unit; we can put the thermos carafe on a tile on our breakfast table and not have to trek to the kitchen for a cup refill. Don't have to worry about the carafe breaking. Fits under our kitchen cabinets. CONS: cleaning parts is more of a chore than with the 300. A short person would have a problem in judging when he has poured the right amount of water in the tank.EQUAL: Quality of brewed coffee."
3,My Cuisinart DGB-600BCW Grind and Brew Thermal Coffeemaker,"In general, I love the look of this product. It brews well with an occasional spillover that cost me a $100 purse....aargh but it doesn't malfunction very often. It's high maintenance to clean, therefore, I've decided to not use it daily...possibly once or twice per week. I've purchased another drip coffeemaker for daily use. My reason for purchasing is that it grinds, has a preset timer and carafe to keep the coffee warm (and it does.)"
5,Great coffee,I have to disagree with most of the reviews. This is the best grind and brew I have owned. Ive had 2 MR Coffee machines that were grind then brew.. I had to rinse the grinder and the filter/top ect. every day. Great coffee is not easy coffee.. Realistically it takes 5 minutes a day to clean and prepair for your next morning coffee. Then you press the Program button once. 6 am my coffee is brewed and hot. I put the caraffe in a box on the floor of my car and drive to work. I never spill a drop and its warm for my 4th and last 8 ounce cup at 12:00 noon.
3,Great Coffee - Great Hassle,"This coffee maker does make a great cup of coffee and keeps it hot! My favorite part is the thermal carafe - it works great. I have had mine for about a year and cleaned it regularly as described in the book. The door that holds the filter and ground beans keeps popping open on mine during the brewing cycle causing a mess in the kitchen as well as ruining the entire pot of coffee as the grounds make their way into the carafe. While this doesn't happen consistently, it does happen about 1 in 10 brews. In addition to this flaw the additional 10 minutes per day required to clean all of the various parts is a hassle - I was willing to put up with that for the great coffee - hot in the thermal carafe, but ruining 1 in 10 pots is a real disappointment and I am in the market to buy a new pot and it won't be another cuisinart."
5,Great product,"No complaints, but one thing you should keep in mind:If you're used to the classic ""dump grounds here, dump water here, flip this switch, wait"" coffee maker, be prepared for a bit more maintenance. Nothing difficult, but you need to clean the grinder between each use and remember to swap the water filter once a month. Also, it's a lot easier to forget things that are obvious on a simpler machine. For instance, if you leave used grounds in the basket and add new beans to the grinder or fill the reservoir without emptying the carafe, you'll have quite a mess on your hands (I wish I could say this hasn't happened to me)."
3,Watered down by Kindle,"On reading the sample on the Kindle, this textbook appeared to present a comprehensive basic review of seawater in a cogent and very readable manner. However, its tables and diagrams as displayed on the Kindle are so reduced in size as to be illegible. The lack of color transmission, and the failure of the font size function to effect these figure elements, makes the value of downloading this textbook questionable."
5,My daughter loves this book!,My daughter (8) is obsessed with horses right now. We bought her this book to help her learn more about the different breeds. It is amazing how she is spewing facts about breeds I have never heard of. She reads this book every night and she loves it.
2,there are better books on the subject,"This is very basic and simplistic text. It could be useful, but there are much better books on the subject. This one seems rather disorganized and poorly explained. I would agree with one reviewer that this looks like a Word document turned into a book. I would add that the whole project looks like a rush job without much planning and thought. As the other reviewer I would also recommend an excellent book by Pratkanis and Aronson The Age of Propaganda. Similar price, but much better and much more sophisticated. Further, if one is interested in logical fallacies, there is this old classic by Nicholas Capaldi The Art of Deception. Finally, you could consider ""Politics and Propaganda: Weapons of Mass Seduction"" (this one is a bit more difficult)."
5,Theo Bikel Writen Music,"When I !""long ago discovered that my copy of this wonderful book was irretrively damaged, I never thought I would see a complete one again, I was extremely pleased to find this book for sale. In it Mr. Bikel shows music for a great number of countris. Thank you for this 'old timer"
3,Pilot PL2055C Driving Lights,"Picked these for the efficent size & simple design for my application. Wanted extra distance and illumination for night driving for trip to Canada in 2001 Honda Civic. Installation was fairly simple, took about 2 hours, good hardware & instructions. Dissappointed due to average output, which is like an 60's car headlights. I upgraded to 100 watt Halogens, but not much better- it could be design of housing not making use of light, which along with weak beam seems to be diffused, as a general light, not focused as a headlight. The price is low, so can't complain on that but I'm planning on upgrading to higher quality set."
3,Pretty Good Lights,"I put these lights in the lower bumper openings of my Crown Vic and they filled the holes well. Light output is very good for a set of lights this cheap, but not anything to get excited about. Fit and finish is on par with the price range. DOES NOT include a relay, only wired for a switch so if you are planning on tying them in to your headlights instead of a switch (like me), be prepared to buy a relay seperately."
4,THIS IS THE MOVIE on CD,"This really isn't a music soundtrack it is the dialogue from the best scenes in the movie... It includes Colonel Kurtz whispering ""The horror... .............. the horror....."" (trail end of last track), reciting The Hollow Men by T.S. Eliot, or the dialogue including ""... you're an errand boy ...sent by grocery clerks to collect a bill."" For true ( possibly obsessive) fans of the movie or Brando this is a must because I have yet to find another CD that is just the movie dialogue. Although if you are a techie then you may just have some way of hooking up your DVD player to a CD recorder and VIOLA! I cannot. Therefore this is the best thing going that I know of."
3,Audio book,"I was sorely disappointed with this album. The narration presented here is genuinely spellbinding, for sure. But the music is crushingly second-rate. I was reminded of how jarringly off the composed score for this film was. The only piece of music which works here, and in the film, is ""The End."" That piece was brilliantly integrated with the visuals and tone of the film, something that cannot be said of Carmine Coppola's bizarrely inept score. Buy ""The Apocolypse Now Sessions"" by the Rhythm Devils for music closer to the film. Like the documentary ""Hearts of Darkness,"" this album, inspired by the film, comes closer to the spirit the film tried to capture than the film itself."
2,False advertising,"This was listed as having the Michael Herr written voiceover narration - as read by Martin Sheen. It did not, making it a pointless purchase."
4,Listen to the film...,"This is not your typical movie soundtrack, and it is a refreshing approach. Basically this 2CD set plays like a condensed version of the film, with all of the highlights captured in dialogue, sound, etc. The music is worked into these audio ""scenes"" nicely. ""The End"" is also featured here in a stunning mix that matches the visuals of this great war film. Even if you haven't seen the film, this soundtrack will certainly intrigue and even excite."
3,Not As Advertised,"This edition is currently listed incorrectly as ""Apocalypse Now [Soundtrack, Import]"" with two dIscs. I purchased this based on the track listing for the two-disc edition whIch included dialogue from the film, but I was extremely disappointed that I only received the single-disc version.Do not buy it if you are expecting the two-disc version."
5,"If you like the movie, you'll love it.","The soundtrack is essential to giving the movie its impact, and this CD proves that the soundtrack itself can stand alone--listening to this music gives you that same creepy, detached sense of psychological horror that the film does. Like the film (which is excerpted in some of the tracks), it is a work of art in and of itself."
3,Did nothing for me,"If the Greatful Dead sang a little better, it might sound like these guys, but the Grateful Dead had better songs. I can't say these guys suck, its just not my bag. This could be a treasure to some. Mostly forgettable blues and country. Was pleasantly surprised by ""Reason to Believe"" (made famous by Rod Stewart). Charlie Daniels produced the 3rd album, which I think I like best from the standpoint of at least trying to break new ground. These guys didn't break any ground, even their definative Lets Get Together is a cover in the vein of Hey Joe (everybody took a crack at it). They probably benefited from the misfires of others before they nailed their great version of this song...but you can probably find it on the Forest Gump Soundtrack and a 100 other places, so don't buy 3 albums just to get it."
5,If you're a hardcore Youngbloods fan...,"Then this compilation is what you've been waiting for. Nothing new here, of course, but good, clean digital renditions of the three best Youngbloods albums. A welome change from my scratchy, worn-out vinyls of the 60s. The Youngbloods weren't all that well known even in the Sixties, but I always enjoyed their music and most of it has worn quite well. You can't lose on this set."
5,Simply the best Youngbloods music.,This CD captures the complete essence of the Youngbloods. This compilationhas it all as far as the Youngbloods musical influence on the 60's musicscene. Unrivaled and unmatched simplicity and musical excellence. This CDhas it all.
4,Great for desks without anchor holes,No surprises with this anchor. It arrived in a plastic OEM bag and was an easy install. No instructions needed.Just use the 3 included self tapping screws and screw the metal hook plate into your chosen location. A plastic cover is then snapped over the base to cover the screws.I only gave it 4 stars because the plastic cover looks kind of cheap.
3,"Bought, but not used","I ended up looping my cable around a post on my desk, I think it's easier than drilling holes in the desk and a little less destructive to the furniture which means something to me since i'm in a college dorm"
1,doesnt include a cable or lock...,"I bought this thinking it would be a cheap way to lock up my new monitor, with its Kensington Security hole. And, amazon's product picture clearly shows a lock and cable included. However, what amazon shipped me was clearly not what I expected. In this so called ""kit"" you will receive some screws, the metal anchor point, and a plastic cover. You will NOT receive a physical lock and cable. I think amazon should have pointed this out to me before I bought it. As for the security it should provide, all you gotta do is unscrew it and guess what- not much better than the cable and lock itself."
3,It could have been so much more...,"Like their later 1994 Pink Floyd recording, this recording of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra playing Pink Floyd could have been so much better than it was. Essentially, it is a recording of a Pink Floyd tribute band backed by an orchestra. The use of electric guitar, electric bass, full trap set, vocalists and synthesizers detracts from the performance and leaves the listener longing for an actual symphonic version of these works. It would have been entirely different if it had been members of Pink Floyd contributing, however it was not. Therefore, it left something to be desired.For a fully symphonic Pink Floyd experience, try ""Us and Them"" by the London Philharmonic."
2,Sad disappointment,"Although I was excited about a new take on Pink Floyd, this is one that should have been left behind. Sadly, the music is driven by a back beat reminiscent of Hooked on Classics from the disco 70's. You would expect better."
4,Very smooth orchestral renditions of popular Pink Floyd song,"The main 'draw' for this CD is the first track, ""When the Tigers Broke Free"" which is also one of the 'missing' tracks from the Pink Floyd The Wall Album (the song figures in the film, but not the soundtrack...). It is a wonderful rendition, which melds well with listening to 'The Wall' itself. The other songs are done very well, and the music of Pink Floyd translates well to an orchestra. I first heard the music over 10 years ago, and I have spent that time searching for it. Here I search Amazon.com, and wow! I found it immediately! Highly recommended for any Pink Floyd fan."
5,Nice background music,"It is nice to hear different non-vocal renditions w/o a ""muzak"" sound to them. The songs are done well. Any Floyd fan should enjoy it."
4,really good with stimualtion,"It vibrates the whole parts down in the penis area when having sex its benmeficial to both parties as it touches her clitoris, i highly recommend it for I found myself coming and having more exotic orgasms"
5,"Simple, Fast",Very Easy to install and works perfectly. Installed on '05 Matrix in just a few minutes. I'm very pleased. Thank you!
5,"Great value, great speed!",Ordered this and received it promptly... installation was a breeze and my laptop is running faster than ever before! Great purchase!
2,MY DISCOUNT MEDIA,"I bought Modern Drummer festival 1997.It was wrapped and all but when I took the DVDs out I noticed they were scratched and had fingerprints on them. This something I never see in new products. The video plays fine up to what I have seen, but still its kind of weird that it came out all scratched and used even though it was wrapped... This is something you might want to think about if you buy from Discount Media... But I really don't know what happened so I don't even know what to think."
4,exellent,"i think this is a very tastefull book, it's exellent!I dont want to review this book, just thank eva hesse for that wanderfull gift."
2,Wont re-purchase,"Its not a bad product, but its also not a good product. This does nothing for my hair, Ive had hair lotions that worked better than this. Im not sure if its hair lotion or conditioner, but Ive used it as either and its just whatever, so Im not going to waste money re-purchasing this. And on top of that, it doesnt smell good, like, at all, so Im not even going to finish the bottle :-p"
2,Waste of Pages.,"The uninteresting book Joy of Pi is mostly of fluff, and extremely little is of value. For most part, the books feels like an excuse to get all men credited for their work in finding the most digits of the pi and setting records. A lot of times, I just wonder why nobody bothered doing the same for e, sqrt of 2, 3, 4, etc., and other transcendental numbers. Of course, after finding godzillion digits of pi, there is no pattern; just random numbers. So, it is akin to a father saying to his son, after he proudly announces that he had found a dead worm in the middle of a sidewalk, ""That's uh...interesting, son."" Oh yeah, random ""Ripley Believe It or Not"" facts sprout in places in terms of what's unique about the pi such as the sequence 123456789 first appears at the 523,551,502nd digit. Oh my God....stop the presses...the nation is in an awe of shock. In short, the journey of the pi is a huge waste of time and totally meaningless in so many ways."
4,3.141592.........,I enjoyed this book immensely. It is neither too long to be ponderous for its subject - a non-technical review of the fascination of the number pi - nor too brief to be trivial. Its graphic nature and content went a long way to maintaining my interest and stimulating my own ideas. Maybe I do have a way to square the circle!Just kidding!!
4,Good Intro to Pi,"This is a handy little book for the mathematically curious adult or college student who have an interest in Pi.But really, they should market this book to kids in junior high and high school who are just developing an interest in math--this book is sure to increase thier interest, and make them ask a few questions.In summary, great book for Novice and Adept math people everywhere."
5,Pi ain't square,"What a delightful book: exemplary in its depth, and fascinating in the writing. As an undergraduate math major, I have been in love with numbers, the lore of numbers, and the history of numbers, and this easy to read but tantalizing in its depth, shows that my passion has not been in vein. I particularly enjoyed the psychology of the pi seekers. It is almost too good for its audience, and should be enjoyed by all ages at all levels. The description of the savants who memorize thousands of digits is memorable. To think of a billion digits without a repeat or a pattern gives me awe. Yet the concept is so simple as to be obvious. I intend to give this to my granddaughter when she turns six."
3,The Joy of Pi,"Everyone knows a little something about pi. It has something to do with circles. It's about 3.14. It goes on forever. This book adds a bit to those scraps of knowledge, providing a short history and a number of factoids. (And an estimate of pi to, I believe, 100,000 decimal places.) Quick, fun reading for those who find dabbling in mathematics fun. Not, however, a rigorous study of any facet of pi."
5,This book is cool!,"This book was fascinating, and I learned alot on pi day.On march 14 (Pi day) I had memorized 50 digits, and wowed my classmates.I reccomend this book to any budding Pi researcher/memorizer"
3,"Great content, poor presentation","As mentioned in other reviews, the visual presentation of this book is rather poor and can make it uncomfortable to read at times.That said, the content is fantastic. Being a fan of both history and mathematics, I thorughly enjoyed this quick, thought-provoking read. One tidbit about an ancient civilization, the Greeks I believe, actually calculated PI as 4, instead of 3 or 3.14, The author marvels at how they were still able to construct buildings that stood at all. This book is a wonderful list of the fascinating culture and history of the only irrational number that exists in nature."
3,Not great but also not bad...,"""The Joy of Pi"" is a short synopsis on the history of pi. Even if you are a math, engineering, life science, or economics major, there are bound to be details in this book that will enlighten you. I was somewhat disappointed in the lack of mathematical jargon in the book though. Also, the book is somewhat difficult to read due to the writing style of the author and the page setup of the book. Text is located in boxes or triangles or circles on nearly every page. It almost appears the author wanted to fill the space and decided to use an irregularly styled page format. Yet, if you are wanting something to read on your next flight or at the swimming pool, this could be a book for you. If the subject matter interests you enough, you might find that there are no references to pursue this information further. This is a drawback to the book. Equations containing pi are included in the book but it is up to you to seek out the proof for these equations."
2,"OK Content, graphics get old","The content of this book about the history of pi is interesting, however it tends to be choppy and overly general. I have a math minor, and I was disapointed at it's lack of depth exploring some of the various equations used to reach the number pi. The thing that bugged me the most was the green graphics on every single page. Great, I suppose if you only read one page at a time, but more than that and you wish they would stop drawing green circles and just get on with the story.For a fun math book, I much more enjoyed Charles Seife's book on Zero or David Bodanis's book on e=mc^2."
3,"A good beginning, but only a beginning","When you begin to read a book that's about six inches by six inches square and 120 pages, you can't expect a masterwork. That being said, Blatner does a decent-enough job giving a cursory look at the number pi, its history, and the current state of research and application. The weakest (by far) section is the first, historical section. Blatner has done most of his writing on scientific and computer-related issues, and as such I guess it is to be expected that his view of history is weak. His incredulity that people who lived thousands of years ago did not hold the same sort of precision on pi as he does tends towards a condescension that does not fit the situation. Beyond this, however, it's a good first step, and it would be a good only step for someone who doesn't want to do a ton of heavy lifting to get a quick, informative read."
5,Great!,"This is a delightful little book about everyone's favorite number (sorry ""e""). Blatner explains the history of pi, attempts throughout the ages to compute pi to hundreds (and then billions) of digits, and the exploits of nerds (much like myself, but smarter) to memorize pi to thousands of digits. There is no heavy math involved; reading this book is a pleasant way to spend an afternoon!"
2,god book,"my son love poppy cat, so i thought that this book was a nice gift, and that will like stimulate him to read... that bood is pretty good, and it have like texture, so its more fun to the kids... but the only think is that if your are going t warp a book please, dont warp it give something that will stick on the book!"
2,It works...barely,"The speakers are small, portable and so easy to carry along. But don't expect any reasonable sound volume from them. Audio is low even at max volume. I used with Creative ZEN Video. Could be impedence issue, but I doubt it."
3,It's not the DVD,"It's fun, but my daughter and I thought we were purchasing a DVD. Admittedly a dumb mistake, but just a caution. The music is fun."
4,Deserved More Success!!,"A delightful, tuneful musical, true to it's source with some wonderful performances, My Favorite Year deserved much more than the month or so that it ran. There have been alot of musicals, not nearly as good as this that have been successful. Oh well!Tim Curry does an admirable job of filling Peter O'Toole's shoes. Andrea Martin is a hoot, and having Lainie Kazan (""Rookie, a seltzer!!"") re-create her film role was brilliant (after all who else could have done it???). The rest of the cast are fine, Evan Pappas is admirable as Benjy.The score is charming and does justice to the film. Curry has a couple of lovely big numbers, Kazan actually has a very sweet ballad, Rookie In The Ring, as well as leading the big show stopper, Welcome To Brooklyn. Martin and Papas do nicely with the comedy numbers, and the title song/finale is quite stirring.Overall a worthwhile musical that deserved more success. Terrific and enjoyable CD, worth having!"
4,If you are a Rage fan....you'll wish you were there.,"The Battle of Mexico City gives you a full-length concert performed my Rage Against the Machine and intermission footage about the followers of Zapata (Which is interesting at some points). The DVD is pretty good. It gives you dolby digital 5.1 but at some points the sound gets really low. The crowd is loud, Zach's vocals are loud, and intro's to some songs are are loud, but the rest of it gets pretty low. If this is a concert, then they should have recorded this properly. Pretty good DVD for any Rage fan though. Buy this one and enjoy yourself into a full length concert."
1,Worst music DVD I have ever seen,Please do not waste your money on this [item]. The fact that every swear word is censored makes the gig unlistenable. Imagine listening to Killing in the name with someone turning the volume down every 5 seconds and you get the picture.Deeply disappointing.
2,What's with the political BS?,After every song there is a political documentary about how the Mexican people are getting screwed. Who cares? If I want to hear about I'll turn on CNN. The most annoying part of this is there is no way to play just the songs so you have to sit with the remote to fast forward through this stuff. Stay away from this one. The self titled DVD is so much better.
2,"Cameras and Editing Miss Rage, Focus on Crowd","It's really too bad that the editors of this viedo were more interested in the crowd and circa 1990 Bon Jovi camera angle changes every 2 seconds then they were the guys. No, it's not bad, but it fails to convey the energy like the previous DVD did.If you had to buy only one Rage DVD, buy the one before this one. It illustrated the energy as well as the crowd far better.This DVD is so polished it's uncharacteristically synthetic for Rage.That said, the sound is outstanding and they're still angry. And they use the media mogules against themselves which I respect."
2,it'll be your go to board game for parties,"i've played this game a few times at a few different gatherings and everyone has had a great, loud, laughing time and we all bonded. you can play this game with couples who've been dating varied lengths of time. i look forward to the next time i play it. it'll be played for years to come and i'm really glad i bought it. it is heterosexist however."
1,"Worst Game EVER!!! Would give ZERO stars, if possible.","Where to even begin...Whoever translated this game should be fired! We didn't come across a single card that did not have some grammatical error or improper sentence structure. The questions to the game do not follow the actual game play rules and cause nothing but confusion. It just makes no sense- from the questions, to the rules, to the turn taking. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! We are hoping to be able to return it tomorrow (even if we have to take in-store credit)."
4,Tired of 'Same old stuff'? Give this one a try.,"I first heard Kevin Connolly at a First Night celebration. Above all, he was a fantastic entertainer. I purchased this CD that night and listen to it often. It's a pleasant change from mainstream pop. The music is fun, smart, the lyrics hit close to home (""Dancing in the Kitchen"" makes me think of the fun my wife & I had when we first bought our house) and it is easy to listen to. Doglovers of the world should make ""Lucy Falls in Love"" their anthem (turn up the sound at the end to hear Lucy add her bit)! Friends come over to the house and, to a person, ask the very same question. ""Who's this you're playing? It's pretty good!"" So give it a try, and if you hear that Kevin Connolly's playing live nearby, definately make the trip to see him."
2,not a bad book,"Even though its years old, the concepts in this book are pretty basic and therefore solid. I doubt any schools would require it now but as a general read you could do worse."
3,Wordy and Too systematic,"As many have pointed out, the book starts great but then it becomes confusing and wordy. There are two reasons for that:1. It analyzes the code systematticly. Every line of code is explained even though it might have been explained earlier in the book. Sometimes the authors repeat themselves and explain the same code twice!2. The authors present long and complicated code just to demonstrate new and simple concepts. This is apparent by their exessive use of GUI applications at the beginning of the book, Especially in chapter 6 ""Methods"".Future revisions of the book must consider the above mentioned problems as they seriously hinder the learning progress."
2,Certainly lacking,"I am currently enrolled in a masters in MIS degree, and we used this text (unfortunately) for one course I took. While I am quite impressed with C#, I felt the presentation of the book was seriously lacking. While its organization did follow a fairly logical pattern, the text itself, and especially the examples presented in each of the chapters, were at best mediorce. I often found that the code examples in each of the sections actually detracted from my learning throughout the course, instead of of being a valuable reference. I would definitely recommend finding another text, especially if the reader is a beginning to intermediate level programmer."
1,"Ya,NOT FOR BEGINNER","Ya, this book not for beginners from chapter 10 to the end of the book because the book doesn't cover the subjects good and that's because the book contain a lot of stuff more than any book in the market, If you are a beginner i agree with the Mr.Zedan's review that you can use wrox books like beginning Visual C#.NET and beginning C# xml , beginning C# web applications, after that you can get WROX HANDBOOKS."
1,for professionals only :(,"First, the book is not for self study or for beginners, and the book contain a lot of uncovered chapters from chapter 12-22 and this mena the whole book, So If you want beginner book that's not yours .. but if you are a C++ programmer or Java programmer then get it and you will find it perfect."
1,Poor,I found the structure of this book difficult to follow and the programs weren't well thought out (at least I didn't think so).
1,Too bad for beginner,"I am studying a Master degree in MIS and using this book for my class.It made me mad and got a lot of trouble.It seems the authors talk so much but doesn't give us any practice. The instructions are not clear.For example: p.567- line 3 , in creating a child form, the guidelines is so confused.There are a lot of problems like this, i do not have enough time to list them all."
1,Good door stop,"This book makes a good door stop. As for the coverage of C#, I wonder if the authors really know C# well enough to write a book ..."
3,VERY Basic--better for pronunciation than vocabulary,"I also got through the entire CD in just a few hours. It's good for starting to build a vocabulary of basic items--food, clothing, travel, numbers (1-20), time, body parts, colors. There are very few phrases, about a quarter of which deal with needing help--lost passport, feeling sick, etc.The best thing about it is the ability to record my own voice (if you have a mike) to check my pronunciation against their speakers; and they provide both male and female voices that you can select individually. Plus, you're speaking at the same time you see the written text.Good graphics, good sound, and some of the quizzes are pretty funny, especially the body parts one where you build a Frankenstein-like person.I'd recommend this to someone who's just beginning with the language; but it's not for someone who wants to learn enough language with which to travel in Finland."
1,UGH....!!!!!!,This particular musical composition by Mr. Roach is the nadir of his career. It has all the charm of mold growing on the walls of your bathroom/water closet. One can just imagine all the worms & other unmentionables crawling into your casket while you R.I.P. A BIG *Zero*!!!!!
1,JOKE,"I received this box of gloves today. The first one that I took out of the box had a hole in it. I tried to put on one of the gloves, the top partbroke off and snapped into. They are advertised to be tough, like for, working on cars etc., you can't put one on, for its breaking. I should haveread the other reviews, concerning them breaking. They are useless. I would send them back, except for the price, it would be more trouble than,its worth. Don't buy them, choose another brand or pay a little more for some that you can use..........................."
3,good price,"good price but they tear easily if you do not use them with care. They always get caught up when drilling, or wire wheeling."
1,Too huge and floppy.,The gloves themselves are huge. At least should be listed as an extra large size. They were constantly slipping off and getting in the way. Eventually I just gave up and got more expensive ones.
1,very poor fit,"these big, floppy gloves are very unmanageable. they are little use for cooking and not much better for cleaning. Remind me of webbed duck feet."
1,"Meant to keep my hands clean, does the opposite",These things are COVERED in powder in the inside. I can't touch anything after removing them because the stuff gets everywhere. Completely defeats the purpose.
5,Great gloves to have at home for a variety of purposes,"These gloves were great to have at home for the occasional dirty job, or to protect my skin from chemicals. I've used latex gloves at home for everything from washing dishes to working with my heating oil tank outside. These latex gloves are just as nice as any other latex glove I've tried. They are lightly powdered and stood up like they should. There are 100 gloves in this box, and it looks to be the cheapest pair of gloves you can get on Amazon (other than the clear plastic food handling gloves). Their inexpensive price is probably because they aren't branded for medical use and instead are labeled for automotive or industrial use.So as long as you aren't seeing patients out of your house, this is a handy box of gloves to have around. You'll be surprised at how often you are reaching for gloves once you buy them. Hope this was helpful. Feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions."
4,Best Price for quality that I found on the internet,"I am overall happy with this purchase. Gloves hold up well against vehicle oil and fluids. I would recommend these gloves. However, if you have an allergy for Latex then look elsewhere. ;o"
2,Not very good quality,"These gloves are short on the wrists. Nonpolar chemicals penetrate these gloves very quickly. I recommend nitrile gloves. These gloves are of exceptionally poor quality however, they leave and smell and a residue on your hands in addition to generous amounts of corn starch. The smell doesn't wash out of your hands and you'll fall asleep smell the latex on your hands."
3,Good cheap general purpose glove,These are very thin and they do tend to bag or stretch as you are using them. I bought them for working around grease and oil and when dealing with chemicals that stain skin and for that they work fine. I have had some trouble with tearing as I put them on but that was just because I was used to a heavier glove and have learned to be more gentle with these. I would not recommend these if you have to do any rough work as the fingers will tear. They have plenty of powder inside so dont wear them if you work around optics. For men get the next size up from what you wear in a cold weather glove.
4,Good Book,My wife wanted this book and it was tough to find this original version. She was very happy to get it and the condition it was in was very good.
1,A Bigoted Test,"I am shocked to learn that this book claims that selecting the color purple first labels you either homosexual or the member of a non-Western country which means you're immature, underdeveloped, and live in a fantasy world. I am even more shocked that no one appears to have been as appalled as I am by this bigoted language. Maybe they didn't even get to the purple page. I couldn't go forward with color selection, I was so appalled and instead recycled the book. Even if it were only that single color's description I would not be able to use the test because of the icky energy attached to such blatant bigotry. I must also add that the positive language attributed to the conformity of selecting the four primary colors within the first five positions rings so strongly of corporate elitism and social conformism that I am not surprised to learn that human resource professionals use the test. Indeed, it gives me a deep insight into the corporate scandals that have trashed our economy."
2,Never buy from here,"The book did not havehe color cards necessary to do the color test. So i spent my money buying something that i cant use. The book was also old, ydlloe colored and smelled terrible. Which i would not have minded if i could of actually done the test inthe firt place."
1,not pleased,"When book arrived, it was missing the color cards that without them, the book became useless !!!I contacted them and they said they would make it right, BUT, they never have sent another book WITH the color cards in it.Unhappy in Tucson,Donna"
5,Try it.,"Yes, it sounds like pseudoscience. You can't judge science by mere logic. That was Aristotle's method. Try it.I have used it many times. I did not use it as a game, but rather as a way to get to know people. (On one occasion, I had to lie and say I lost the test when it was way too disturbing. A mutual friend said the girl and her mother talked about death all the time.) In high school, I found the kids with good grades all had very little stress, with two exceptions, both eccentric and very smart, who showed stress of being ""overacheivers"", of pushing themselves too hard. Years later I gave it to my 4 year old, and it said he was prone to emotional outbursts when he did not get his way, and was easily distracted by the new and exiting. It will change day to day, because it is not only a personality test, but also a mood test. I had several people try to fake the test by picking cards at random, and I spotted it; The various group meanings did not correlate."
1,Color Psychology is NOT a Science at all.,"The book, while entertaining and written in a pleasant style, is full of inaccuracies, speculation and logical errors.Certainly, the Color Tests should not be used for any purposes other than parlor talk."
2,"Total nonsense, but very well done","This book claims to be able to tell you specific things about your past, present and future life by your preference of colors. The theory behind it all is quite wooly and essentially nonsensical, it's not been tested properly and as such is mere supposition.If you do the test you WILL find out facts about your personality. Unfortunately they are NOT specific to you. They are true for 99% of the planet. If you read the statements for ANY choice of colors you will see they all sound true, a bit like the astrology section of your Sunday magazine.You may prove this to yourself by doing the test to someone else but selecting the wrong readings without telling them. If they are so inclined, they will believe insight has been obtaineed.Excellent resource for people who want to convince others they are intuitive or even psychic. Just don't base your life on it."
2,Alpaca Blanket,"I love this blank, so soft and warm but it sheds all over everything it comes in contact with. I wish there was something to stop the shedding."
4,"Less than expectations, but very nice too","The blanket is quite luxurious to the touch. It does appear to be a quality item. My expectations were dimished though. I was expecting a blanket much thicker than it was, especially for the price tag & also the over all size was significantly smaller. Would I purchase it again, no, for the loss of expectations ....... but at $55, yes, definately."
4,Great learning tool for children,"This is a pretty good product for the money. It does not have a ton of content and it's more geared toward vocabulary building rather than conversations, but it's okay -- hence 4 stars. I just recently bought it for my children to help them learn the language and they love it. It's simple, easy to use and entertaining. they are on it all the time. It's probably not the best choice for a serious or intermediate learner, but will do for a total beginner."
2,PU,A very perfumey product and doesn't work on my fine curly hair. It's too heavy and stiff. I used it during the summer when my hair is curlier so I know it won't work in the winter.
5,keep hair soft,This product conditions the hair nicely. I am not sure if it promotes any growth but makes the hair very manageable.
5,Rediscovered Hollywood Treasures!,"Can it be true?!! The first movie songs by Doris Day are now available to everyone. These are classics and full of that energy that made Doris Day a box-office hit right off the bat. My personal favorite is ""Absent-Mined Heart"", a soft senual lover's ballad. If you're a Doris Day fan, you must have this CD."
4,Not bad at all.,"Traditional BS matereal: radio-friendly pop tunes with brilliantly written lyrics that have that razor-sharp wit that makes The Beautiful South such a joy to listen to.Mabey not as good as ""Blue is the Color"", but still a great album."
3,Not as good as I expected,"Having been a Housemartins fan, then a Beautiful South fan since their first album, I was somewhat disappointed in Quench. I didn't find the songs as catchy or cutting or sarcastic as previous albums... and I swear it sounded like they just got out of rehab..got a little problem with the drink? Just a little too mellow and slow for my taste. Still a fabulous band, but I'd recommend Choke, 0898, Welcome to.., or carry on up the charts if you're not familiar with the band."
4,a great return to form,"This is the BS back at their best, after the disappointment of the previous, rather wishy-washy album.The happy tunes couples with the dark themes may sound depressing and rather weird on the surface, but believe me, it's worth a listen. All the old themes are back - alcohol, bad relationships, etc. BUY IT!"
2,WORTHLESS,"Please don't waste your time. I am so glad I rented this instead of buying it. It has a very very few shining moments, but for the most part it is BORING the same fighters with different colored hair. Great idea. Very poorly executed. Don't waste your money. If you are still curious rent it first. You'll be glad you did."
2,Did the Game Designer Even See the Film?,"This game is horrible. I question whether the game designer has even seen the movie. Fight Club was a beautiful film with a story that could have become a great game, a la GTA 3. Tyler Durden leads Project Mayhem in the film in which all sorts of tasks have to be completed to destroy consumer society. ""Fight Club is just the beggining"" he says. Watch the movie and you will demand gameplay that allows you to destroy the trendy coffee shop, make bombs from liposucked fat, and intimidate the city mayor by threatening to remove his manhood. This game ignores all that and instead focuses on repetitive fighting. They had a chance to make greatly controversial game that would have blown GTA out of the water and they blew it. If you want a good fighting game, look elsewhere. If you want a game more like Fight Club should be, pick up GTA for $20 or get GTA San Andreas now on PS2 or wait for the X-Box release."
3,Waiting to play,My son is unable to play on his new system and our old system has a forgotten security code on it from years ago so no Mature games can be played on it. Looking into resetting and will be able to give a better review once he plays it. He's just happy to have.
1,I am Jack's hatred for Vivendi,How could you destroy a revolutionary movie like Fight Club by making a game franchise out of it?! Disgusting!
5,Generation X Meets Bob Wills and American History,"Roaming the pubs and Knight of Columbus Halls of Texas is a trio which stamps its own talent on arguably the most American idiom - Western Swing. These folks are not conservationists or musical librarians -they're talented musicians who have chosen a genre that kept two generations dancing to a music for which no rubric applies but to which everybody can shuffle. Jazz, blues, R&B, country, Mexican, hillbilly - it's all there in every song, and it all makes musical sense. Any band which, as I've seen, can get four generations off their folding metal chairs and on to the dance floor is definitely worth a listen."
5,Hot Club SWINGS in Tulsa,"My husband and I just saw HOT CLUB perform last night at the 4th of July Festivities in Tulsa. I have to be honest and say I had never heard of them before but they have me looking to buy all their music now. I am a fan of the Bag Boys out of Boston and this Group made me think of them and how much I like that Western Swing. I am a listener of Soft Rock and Oldies but when I hear a great group like this my tastes change easily.Elana is full of energy and fun to watch. She introduced a couple songs she wrote last night and she should be a STAR of the highest rank. We had a great time and will be watching this Group from now on.Wendy Rose Alvarez in Broken Arrow, OK"
4,Roots of swing,"In the latest craze to ""reinvent"" all the old musical genres, it's nice to see someone still playing the roots of the swing movement, which were in the blue-grass and C&W world, not in ""pop culture."" HCoCT shows off excellent musicianship (rare in this day and age of 32-track recordings) in a recording that could have been made live, and feels ""real"" as opposed to preserved, prepackages, premeasured, preshrunk and preworn. And don't miss the lyrics, as they have a more biting undertone than most."
1,this album should not have hot or club in the title.,This album has a deceptive title. It is neither hot nor club sounds. The music sounds like re-recorded old bluegrass that your great grandparents might have listened to. Nothing too snappy in this group to get you pumped up.
4,A Forgotten Star Musical Of the 50's Re-Released,"Though not as well known as many of the classic 50's musicals and having opened in the same year as ""Gypsy"" and ""The Sound Of Music"",REDHEAD has many things to recommend it. First is the premiere collaboration of Bob Fosse and Gwen Verdon.The album cover even has all the classic Fosse trademarks:The cocked hat,the sexy pose and the girl in tights.Then there's the novelty of Broadway's first mystery musical,predating ""Drood"" by 25 years.Next is the last work of book writer Herbert Fields who wrote many of the classic Rodgers & Hart musicals of the 20's.Combine that with lyrics by his sister Dorothy,additional material by Sidney Sheldon (yes THAT Sidney Sheldon)a Tony award winning score by Albert Hague (better known as the Music teacher in ""Fame"") and great performances by Verdon and Richard Kiley and you have a great and far too neglected musical.For fans of all kinds."
4,Pleased,I like to shop from home this was shipped very fast and packed well. I use nothing but Scott's on my lawn
4,Shimmery dreampop,"If you like your dreampop with swirly guitars and gossamer female vocals, this is the cd for you. Bask in the bliss."
5,Nice Music,"I play this CD while I'm in the kitchen cooking. I can't say I have lost any weight, but it is pretty back-ground music."
5,"Honor: Strength, honour and compassion","I placed my first review in ""Field of Dishonour"". It says many things I believe, about why I (and many others) enjoy this series. While it is seldom intellectually stimulating, and often predicatable, it has a powerful (and for me) over-riding virtue. Honor Harrington does her job. Period. Her sense of duty, honour, loyalty, compassion and her simple worldview set and challenge readers to acheive a standard long buried in this modern age of compromise and isolationism. Read this book. Then read the others. You may not like the 'space opera' but you must admire the courage so rare in our society."
5,Feed your imagination.,Imagine the future where people have taken to the stars. Earth has been lost to these people but they made out alright. Now imagine your the captain of a battleship not of the water but of space. That is what it is like to read this book. It takes your imagination for a ride and leave you hanging for more. Lluckily there are more books to the series. Once you read this one you will be hungry for more. And thanks to the small history in the back you won't get lost with some of the technical terms
2,Very disappointing,"A friend recommended this book very highly, so I had high expectations -- and was very disappointed. It's pure space opera, with very little that gives you pause to think. I'm sure it's very PC to have a female at the helm of the ship, but that alone isn't enough of a redeeming factor to make this worth reading. One sentence summary:A shoot-em-out in space with a female in charge.Nothing more, nothing less. Don't waste your time if you like SF with any kind of thought-provoking themes."
4,A fun ride!,Nothing to deep here. Weber is a master at the fairly simple yet vastly enjoyable Sci-Fi yarn. His 1st book in the Honor Harrington series is a prime example of what makes Weber such a great read. He balances characters with action very well. He has rapidly become one of my favorite Sci-Fi authors.
2,Audio version review only,"As for the book reviews, Many people have already covered that.This is specifically for the audiobook.I loved the series. But when I received the box of cd's and placed it in my player, I was dismayed that 11 of the 13 disks had 99 tracks per disk, and only one track, for the whole book, is over 1:30. One was even 8.7 sec.After that, I started noticing how often I could hear the reader take a breath, which after the fist cd started becomming annoying (so much so I've started editing them out on my copy) and while doing that, I started to notice the mis-readings and I am still only on the first disk.Then there is the tracks that are mostly silence due to being chapter changes, of even the 'This is the end of disk X, please insert disk Y'I am hoping that the company that is producing the audiobooks will do a better job for the later books"
2,Asimov would be laughing,"I wasn't introduced to this series on my own. When I read the book I had already read many famous sci-fi stories. Educated people introduced my to this book and when I read it it was a big dissapointment. I started getting interested after the profanity and long list of technologies. After I finished up the book it made me wonder. Is this what modern science fiction is coming to? There was too much plot. I appreciate the fact that their was a women role model but still as a female I think it was way too predictable. What's this going on and on about Honor's bad looks-it wasn't from lack of personal care. Lastly, toward the end of the book I knew exactly what was going to happen and how. The predictability was too great. Email me for defense at Beanie9585@aol.com"
5,Great Start,"While I have found that all the Honor books can stand alone as fun space opera, this first one does a fine job to set the stage and fill you in on what you need to know about the world of Harrington. IMO better the any of the Star Trek novels I have read. Nice mix of speculative science, Space combat and creation of Hornblower in Space."
4,Great start to series,This is a good book for people that love to read. The reader doesnt have to be a major SiFi fan to enjoy it.
2,A good read,Fun book fast paced space opera with some nice albeit a bit shallow characterization. Worth a look. a good read.Shawnirey
5,WARNING! This is an addictive series!,"As a female sci-fi fan this is a delight! I bought On Balsilisk Station because it was only $1.99 on special. What a great bargain! This book is tightly written and action packed. It has great character development, but doesb't get bogged down. The battle scenes are well choreogragphed and the narrative effectively switches from place to place and character to character.I highly recommend this book, with the warning that you may as well order the other 10 books which have been published. Honor is a worthy heroine and here cadre of companions and enemies are great company!"
3,A light escape to the space-ways ...,"Thoroughly entertaining for readers after some light escapism, but only for FF (Futuristic Fiction) readers who like a liberal dash of pseudo-science. A little two-dimensional with very little depth to the characters, this book none-the-less offers enough action, political-intrigue and fantastically despicable antagonists to make it a great read despite a sometimes annoyingly perfect heroine. As a woman myself I have no objection to a strong female character, but a few flaws would make her seem a little more human. If you like this book I recommend that you seek out the rest of this series."
3,Good start,"The first in the series, Weber has shown tremendous growth as he developed the series bringing complicated political and military scenarios to the reader. Character development has been wonderful. But, this is the first and it shows"
5,Hornblower lives!,"Great naval tale, but set in the future. The attention to detail makes it really interesting. I first read this when it first came out, and now I have read all the subsequent and related novels. When is the next one out? I need another fix--bad!"
5,I own the original paperback,I like this book so much I have added the Kindle version to my book collection. Cant wait to get rest of the series
4,"Good book, easy read","I liked this book, it read easily and held my interest. Story line develped well. I would recommend to other readers"
5,"A ""must read""","Excellant Military Sci-Fi. But it's much more. Intrigue, gun-play, treachery, galactic politics, broadsides, covert ops, exotic alien life-forms, and Commander Honor Harrington, if you need something else, you're just being picky;)As usual for me, I bought a new paperback which caught my eye at the local bookseller, read the first chapter, put the book down utterly impressed (which is not usual), and sought out the rest of the series waiting to finish it in order. I was not disappointed, in fact; Weber is officially on my list of ""Favorites"", along with Steven Brust (though I stay away from his Dumas retellings), David Drake, and Robert Asprin. This book is a gem of the genre, and I finally found the 2nd book in the series today (Honor of the Queen) so I've got to cut this short (and start reading:)"
5,Good,This book is a must if you have read any of David Webber's work. The story starts out for honor harrington as her first assiment as a star ship captian. After an Unsuccessful feild exersise honor ends up on Basilisk Station comanding the only star ship represented by the Queen. This is the only the beginging of the fun!
2,"Fantastic story and performance, but the disc the MPS was on was bad.","Two of the chapters would not play, however I had read the book so this was not a major problem, just a disappointment. This disappointment is the reason I rated this product as a 2. If the disc had no problems, I would have given a 5. This review is not to take away from the story or the performance in any way. It was just a bad disc. I would have hoped they would have had better quality control, but occasionally these things happen. I listened to the second book and the CD was fine and the story and performance was outstanding."
4,GREAT first book in the series - FREE for now,"I REALLY enjoyed this book. I give it 4.5 out of 5 stars. it takes a lot for a book to get that from me.The book overall is well thought out, and the series is very good. The book does not start slow, which is sometimes the problem with space opera as the author tries to build in the background.If you like SF, then try this series!"
5,This will get you hooked on Honor!,"Read this a few years ago in paperback and was hooked. I now own every paper book version of the entire series, and have read them all twice! Acquired ""On Basilisk Station"" recently for my brand new kindle and will probably buy all the newest books in the series as they come out for the kindle. If you love military sci-fi and great immersive writing, read ""On Basilisk Station"". You will be glad you did!"
4,Addictive if not nutritious military SF,"The Honor Harrington series is readable and addictive military space opera. Honor is gutsy, principled, competent, compassionate, and tough as nails. She just wants to do her job and do it right. Nimitz, her treecat (or is she his human?) is the male cat-lover's ideal.Two caveats:In the earliest Honor books, especially this one, all conversations follow almost exactly the same formula: Detailed description of every facial tic; tension, cool voices, poker faces, second-guessing, suppressed smiles/frowns/astonishment, taut shoulders, glimmers of smiles/frowns/astonishment in their eyes, discomfiture, abrupt ending; mention that Honor has dark brown eyes and a cool soprano voice; repeat in next chapter.Also, the technology and tactical descriptions can be way too elaborate for some folks. If you don't want to understand how and why the ships work, you may be better served elsewhere. If you like that stuff, you'll love the Honor Harrington novels."
4,Weber did advanced science right,"Speaking as a scientist, David Weber obviously did his homework before writing this series. He never conveniently forgets about things like inertia the way most sci-fi *cough*Star Trek*cough* does. Yes, the science comes at you pretty heavy in this first book. Just as you're starting to understand ""sidewalls"" and ""bellybands"" he throws ""Warshowski sails"" and ""grav waves"" at you. But this isn't just technobabble. This is the basic foundation of the interstellar society he's building. The tech is a fundamental part of the background, and a fundamental part of the main plot. Once you're past the first book and comfortable with the world Weber built, the story really takes off.... Each sequal is BETTER than what came before and that is a rare thing for an author to pull off. If you don't like Weber's attention to military, science, and storytelling detail, you should at least respect it."
2,I wanted to like this book,"I love military scifi and space opera. I really wanted to like this book.So, I trudged thru this book hoping it would get better. It never did.The story has an interesting premise...Honor Harrington gets command of a the ""H.M.S. Fearless"". The ship has just been rebuilt with crappy armament.The book bogs down with the descriptions of armament, the Royal Navy, and politics. I don't mind the details, but please at least make them mildly interesting. I found myself skipping 2-3 paragraphs at a time. Character development is also very shallow. Dialog wasn't that great either...Weber illogically shifts between characters. Sometimes it's hard to tell who's talking.I recommend Elizabeth Moon's Serrano Legacy over Weber's borefest. Two stars for the good ship names and for the treecat."
2,Tedious,"I have read a lot of sci-fi but never anything in the ""military sci fi"" area. I therefore thought I'd give Weber a go. I could have started with Moon or Feintuch, I guess, but Weber seems to have gotten the most favourable reviews.I now know I am not a ""military sci-fi"" fan. I may as well have read a normal, boring Clancy-esque techno-thriller. It was too over the top with it's technobabble and I found the whole ""space navy"" scene totally dull. Maybe if I did 5 years in the armed services I would have liked this novel a little more.The actual storyline was dull. The character interactions were dull. I have given 2 stars only because Weber seems to know about matters navy related and also because he has entertained a lot of readers (so many 4-5 stars reviews!)"
2,Emphasis on Scientific Explanation not on characters,"David Weber's Honor Harrington books were recommended to me because I read a lot of Elizabeth Moon. However, the two authors have completely different approaches to similar material. Moon focuses on the characters and their interactions, while Weber spends pages explaining how the technology behind the ships was developed. If you're into that sort of lengthy technobabble, this is a book for you. If not, I suggest Moon's Sporting Chance as a good place to start."
1,"Good book, great series, horrible reader.","I love this book and this series. However, I was extremely disappointed by the performance of the narrator, Allyson Johnson, I just couldn't bring myself to listen to her for more than ten minutes. I recommend you get the Madelyn Buzzard version. Buzzard is not the greatest reader I've encountered, and her scratchy, low pitch voice does not fit Honor's melodious soprano, but it shines in comparison to the travesty committed by Johnson."
3,Brian's review,Necessary to the Honor Harrington series. The technical stuff re: space travel mechanics are distracting.
5,Love It,"Read it over and over, again and again. Please ask the publisher to put more of this series on Kindle."
5,Terrific space adventure!,"The first of David Weber's ""Honorverse"" series. It's one of the best space adventure series ever. If you've never read any of the books, this is where you start."
4,Old SciFi Dog,"First I really liked this book and I feel very fortunate to have discovered David Weber as an author.In this book you will be interduced to the Honor Harrington's universe. The science and social make up of this universe is as complete and as consistent as the very best of Hard SciFi (including Larry Nivin, Jerry Pournelle, Robert Heinlein, Frank Herbert, Isaac Asimov ... etc).The characters are sometimes plane, humorus, heroic and sometimes dispicable. The character developement is complete, and I found the characters believable and real - that goes for both the good and bad gu ... ah, people. Although some may find Honor's character hard to believe at times, I have found much wilder characters in actual military history.I especially enjoy Mr. Weber's sense of humor, although I suspect he enyoys pulling our leg a little (a lot?).In all, this book and author deserve to be read and I would have given it 5 stars except some (I have read them all) in this series are even better."
5,A great introduction to a great series,"After reading this book, I was completely hooked on Honor. There are two great qualities to this work and the other books in the series, The internally consistant and well explained technology, and Weber's complete lack of concern for wiping out characters. As far as the first one goes, I, for one, appreciate greatly the explainations of how the technology works, why the tactics are such as they are, and how these ships are fought. Some may see it as techno-babble, but a few years ago so were RAM, CPU, and all the other terms that we now use in casual conversation. Second, I really appreciate how Weber has no problem with killing his characters. In the situations that Honor gets herself and her crews into, some people aren't going to come back. The main characters are in dangerous situations, and some of them get bitten. Good! Now, if Mr Weber would only write the next ones faster."
5,If you liked Horatio Hornblower and SciFI you'll love it,"I didnt get around to reading the Horatio Hornblower books until I was in my early twenties and I loved them. What made them special was not only excellent characterizations, but Forrester was able to make you smell the salt water and hear the creaking of the wood on the ships. David Weber has successfully translated that world into the Honor Harrington universe. A full fledge character (nothing 2-D about her) Honor has the ethics and honor of our greatest heroines, intermeshed with the hardware and politics of a science fiction universe that's as diverse and extensive as any ever created.As a female reader, what I think I enjoyed most was the insight into the personalities we meet, including the treecat Nimitz. This is a real page turner. I've bought several copies to give to friends."
2,Too much technobabble,"The characterization was terrible. Only Honor and her executive officer had a little depth. Almost all the other characters had no distinguishing features except their physical description and their job duties.Too much time was spent in the battle descriptions at the end, particularly in the dialogue. Once you strip away the little characterization there is, you're left with spaceship velocity descriptions. I had much more fun reading Bujold's Miles Vorkosigan series."
2,Contrived Millitary Sci-Fi,"I only read the first five chapters and, in frustration, skipped ahead to the ending, so maybe I'm not doing this book justice. Perfect Honor got dishonored for reasons outside of her control, fine, life isn't fair. But it just seemed a little too set-up for me how her defamation managed to get her at an important military post just in time to save her nation from invaders. Now if she coped with her unjustly lowered status by swallowing it, working hard, and gradually winning back the respect of her peers, this would have been a very different book.However I did read one more Honor Harrington book, Flag in Exile, which I like much better, so consider this review as two-and-a-half stars instead of just two."
2,"Pure Pulp SF for the bus-ride home, nothing more.","Not a lot to say really because this isn't the type of SF I normally go for, so I won't be too critical.If you like simple, lighthearted military SF, lots of battles, hokey weapons, endless technobabble, corny dialogue, and cheezy characters, then you'll probably have some fun with this.If you enjoy SF that really challenges your intellect, thirst for real depth of characterization, and thrive on complex, developed plotlines, then don't bother to look here.It's obviously not aimed at that market anyway.For example, in chapter 3:""and HMS Fearless leapt to an instant acceleration of five hundred and three standard gravities""....really now!! I just laughed and stopped reading.Like I said, good for a short bus-ride, so you don't need to stare out the window."
1,The Worst Book I Ever Read!!!,"Honor Harrington is a very technically monotonous, predictable book I have ever read. It focuses on technology technology technology. Why exactly does Weber have to include so much about sidewalls, Warshawski sails, terminuses, missiles, impeller wedges, impeller drives... the list goes on. This boom is stupid. It is a waste of my money. Folks don't buy these books, I know you won't regret it."
5,First class space strategy and tactics,"Impossible tasking, inadequate equipment, hostile crew and murky politics give Captain Honour Harrington a phenomenal mission on her first command. Tasked to assist in the defence of a strategically important wormhole junction, Honour is abandoned by the regional commander who is determined to see her fail. The expansionist Haven empire has engineered an uprising amongst the local indigenous population to justify an intervention which would grant them control of the junction. This is a first class novel for those who love detailed military sci-fi. David Weber has a large collection of print published novels, including a number of stand alone Honour Harrington novels, and this is of the same high quality storyline and editing. A very worthwhile addition to your library."
4,Good story,"Good story. A bit predictable, formula-ish but fast paced and fun. Main characters are well thought out and engaging. Some others though, are ""window dressing"" for the plot. Books get better as the series continues. This is a pretty good intro for a very good series."
5,Top Notch,"This is a Jazz album to savour, recorded in New York in 1959 it has the right ingredients.This swings like hell. In fact, in the fascinating original sleeve notes by Mingus he says that to some extent this album was a reaction to the critics who said he didn't swing enough. As Mingus rightly points out though the blues can do more than just swing.It has many top quality musicians including Jackie McLean, Booker Ervin, Horace Parlan, Mal Waldron and Pepper Adams.Of course this being Mingus he manages to incorporate a little dissonance in his own unique way and the whole album is, well funky (can't think of another word to describe it).I've had this recording for years now and have only just started listening to it again. Its lost none of its power. A Fabulous recording."
4,An excellent resource for beginners,"This cd is an excellent resource for building your vocab, the interface is excellent and easy to use. However I am very disapointed with the publisher that they haven't continued the series to intermediate and advanced. I am still using it but I know that there is a life to it. Some of the games can also be completed by memory!! Categories include indepth vocabs such as Food, shopping, phrases, body parts etc. with about 4 in each.If you are learning Farsi and have no or little experience of the language then don't hesitiate in getting it otherwise maybe look for another resource."
4,Talk Now! Farsi,"The program is great and very helpful. It has a printable dictionary for each section as well as a portion of each section where you use a microphone to speak the words being taught to help you say everything properly! I love the program itself, the only downfall is that you'll really like it and when you want to move to intermediate and advanced you find that the publisher doesn't have Farsi for either of those!! I think it's pretty sad that they start you off and then don't have Farsi in intermediate or advanced but at thelst the beginner's program is great!"
4,Sterling Bracelet,Nice bracelet for a small wrist. Looks dazzling with several colored stones -well worth the money ! Inexpensive ! I just love it !
2,Writers for young adults supplement 1 edition 1,"This was not what I was hoping to read about. It basically interviews Young Adult novelists. I was looking for something that shared some of the points of their success or how they succeeded. However, for the price of $3 +/- I guess it was okay."
3,BUMPER Only,Looks good but item is bumper only no tire carrier as pictured. Amazon said everything in picture but not the case.
1,Too good to be true.,Doesn't come with tire carrier. When I put it in my cart a whole different bumper was displayed. Classic case of false advertising. Glad I caught it before I purchased it.
2,do not buy,"This video is not very good. 1st of all the title is misleading, 2nd is not shiatsu but anma 3rd to call something clinical id expect to see several conditions, lower back, shoulder and neck pain is not enough, the presentation of the video is good and there is a tcm theory tutorial, if you are a beginner you might like the video just remember this is a anma massage video."
4,BEST DVD,"IT'S A VERY GOOD DVD EXCEPT THERE ARE COUPLE THINGS I LIKE TO MENTION. ONE, IT DOES'NT SHOW ONE TRANSION TO ANOTHER WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT PART OF SHIATSU OR ANY OTHER MASSAGE. SECOND, THERE IS NOT ENOUGH STRECH TECHNICS FOR DIFFERENT MERIDIANS. THIRD, IT SHOULD SHOWS COMPLETE SHIATSU MASSAGE BEFORE IT BREAKS DOWN INTO ARMS AND LEGS."
4,Guy knows his stuff,"Good presenter, decent amount of information. I would have liked to have seen more techniques shown; the hands-on part did get a bit boring. This is an pretty good video to have, but I'm still in search of one that has more practical demonstrations that my students can follow along with in class. The theory presentation was very good."
4,An unexpected gem,"Having some friends who have been involved with Ultimate Frisbee, I thought this documentary would be interesting. After watching it, I learned it wasn't as much about UF as it is about friendship, camaraderie and the lack of borders when it comes to the human spirit.Brett McCall has done an excellent job of weaving a story that brings together people from all walks of life - who truly enjoy and appreciate each other and have lots of fun along the way. This, combined with the international aspect makes it truly worth your time."
5,...A GEM AVAILABLE NEWLY AS A BEAUTIFUL MINI LP!,"On his first Little David release, Rankin almost hits full stride. His reworking of ""Peaceful"" brought the song, and ultimately Rankin, a wider audience. The album eschews some of the preciousness of previous efforts and has a more universal appeal. Songs like the title cut and ""Stringman"" spotlight Rankin's continued growth as a songwriter. His songwriting, along with his gorgeous voice and unique and jazzy acoustic guitar prowess on the record, made him one of the staples of FM radio, a trend that would continue through his next few albums. As good as the record is, it merely sets the tone for Rankin's next few recordings, which represent truly his best."
2,Rankin at his least inspired,"If you're looking for memorable Kenny Rankin, pass on this cd. It's dated and over produced. You're better off buying almost any of Kenny's other cds before you buy this one. His voice is wonderful as always, but this appears to be Kenny at his least inspired."
3,Where the heck is Bubble!,"""~With the legendary ""Monty Python: The Holy Grail"" and a few skits from the "" Benny Hill Show"" as exceptions, I find British Comedy to be stale. good as the series. Edina and Patsy were thier usual bitchy, haughty, overindulgent, loveable selves. Those two will always have a special place in my heart, but Grand's clique of old folks annoyed the hell out of me and were totally unwatchable. The movie was good as long as you got the old fast forward button working whenever the old folks appear. But what broke my heart the most is that Edina's airheaded secretary, Bubble, was not in this one! How dare they do this! Overall, this movie was okay, but I would recommend to viewers to check out the regular series for AbFab's best work."
5,Best Ever,"I recently bought ""The Last Shout"" where Patsy and Edina holiday in France and it was absolutely hilarious especially the scene where they end up in the Bal Musette. I loved the show when I lived in London and now that I'm in the US I've bought the entire series."
5,"Thin and gorgeous, review your features","Ab Fab is probably the most hilarious show I've ever had the chance to watch. With this last video, celebrate Ed's and Pat's departure by buying a nice bottle of champ', two packs of cigs, dress up, put on tge tape, and enjoy with a crazy friend: the experience is worth trying! You'll soon behave like the two fab brit girls, will neverendlessly laugh, and... that's what life is made for, right, darling?"
5,Laughed till it hurt,"This was a great show, I wish it hadn't ended. The ski-trip scene is a highlight, as is rocker Marianne Faithfull as God. Eddie & Patsy are in rare form, drinking, smoking, swearing, breaking stuff, my God, does it get any funnier?"
4,Good book.,"I may be a little biased this book was written by my departed grandfather and it was a chance to connect to him a little. I am not a catholic so I can't say I agree with all of it but it nice to ""hear"" my grandpa."
3,boring,"the problem i have with jesse powell is the same problem i have with debrah cox,tamia,tevin campbell,and divine.and the problem is that they sound boring.they just make typical bland r&b.not that its a problem if thats what your into.but their version of R&B is like mash potatoes with no seasoning.i mean theres no funk,no soul no nothing.its just what it is regular R&B. yeah theres nice funky james on here like the first single.but thats about it."
1,Whiny and horrible,His singing voice is annoying and the dreadfully horrible casio-produced beats juxtapose horribly. BAD ALBUM! WACK!
5,super touchy!,I heard the song 'you' on the way to school one day morning on the radio and it's torn my heart. Jesse Powell totally brought up the feeling of 'you' It's somehow more than Jewel's 'foolish games' which is one of my favorite rainy day song!
5,OUSTANDING!!!!,"Jesse has a voice that will rock you through those tough times. I feel that Jesse is on his way to the top. He definelty deserves more props than I can give him. I would also like to give a shot out to his writers, because they are doing and incredible job with the lyrics. Good luck!! You definetly have grammy material hope to see you there soon."
4,It is a great album that you could listen straight through.,"The album is very relaxing to listen to and it reminds me of a mixture of Brian McKnight and Stevie Wonder. The music is great and contains awesome lyrics that anyone could relate to. If you love R&B or soul music, then you would enjoy Jesse Powell's new album"
3,"All i can say is ..""YOU""","the best song of the whole album is ""YOU"" I dont mean to hate jesse but u goin in the one hit wonder category if it wasnt for ""you"" , you probably wouldnt sold 500,000 units"
4,Tight,"GO JESSE! Doing good. That CD was okay and it could have been a little better. But that's okay. If there's a next album, I'm sure that one will be tight, too"
3,"Bout It is a tough act to follow Jesse Powell, the 1st LP","Bout It is a decent album and is worth listening to. If your are new to Jesse Powell, I would suggest his first LP, Jesse Powell. Although the album has a bit of dance music that is fair at the most, it has lovely balllads. The title track You is the albums best song and is representative of Powell's extraordinalry talent. Jesse Powell should concentrate on singing ballads and leave the dance tracks to Puff Daddy."
5,LaChiusa at his most affecting,"Michael John LaChiusa is my personal favorite of the ""new generation"" of theatre composers; he blends a modern and experimental approach with traditional theatricality in a very exciting way. This 1994 effort lacks a bit of the edge of the recent ""Marie Christine"" and ""The Wild Party"" -- in its place is a strange kind of warmth and optimism. Even as the characters of ""Hello Again"" try and fail to find emotional fulfillment through ... liaisons, there's never a doubt that most of them have the capacity to find it in some other way.And as is typical for LaChiusa, the score is highly melodic and accessible, if not something that can be easily broken down into individual songs. Insofar as it can, ""Tom"" is the principal standout. The lyrics are clever and appealing, and the performances first-rate without exception."
4,"Fascinating adaptation of ""La Ronde""","""Hello Again"" is Micheal John LaChusia's muscial adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's play about sexual intricacies, ""La Ronde""(the latter was recently adapted once again by David Hare and was featured in the 98-99 Bway season starring Nicole Kidman-""The Blue Room"".) Just the cover of this CD is enough send close-minded conservatives far away...however, those willing to give it a listen will not be dissapointed. LaChusia's score is rich and varied as it hops from one locale and time period to another. The cast is truly top notch and the CD liner notes do a great job of filling in the blanks about this most interesting Lincoln Center Theatre production. For those who are willing to take the time and really listen...LaChusia's score is a treasure, however, one time listeners may be dissapointed. Much like his comtemporaries, LaChusia's music merits repeat examinations and rewards loyal listeners."
4,How to choose a Chinese name using Chinese name analysis,"This book explains the ancient calculations involved in choosing a Chinese name. It uses Mandarin pinyin and simplified characters and is writen in English. The ancient theories include: the 5 elements; number of strokes for yin-yang; the lunar birthdate and 8 characters; and the Chinese horoscope. As well, 300 English names are translated into Chinese."
3,Outdated for 2001 babies,"Good book overall, but for some sections where there are recommendations for names or elements, the book stops at the year 2000, so it's useless for people like me who's trying to find names for new baby born in 2001."
4,New edition for year 2002 onwards,"I am considering this book since I'm looking for an auspicious name for my baby who will be born next year (2003). But according to one of the readers, it is outdated if you need to determine the best name for year 2001 onwards.Will the author Evelyn Lip considering ofpublishing new edition for year 2002 onwards so thatwe can determine what is the best name base on the element andbirth date."
4,Not compatible with Mac OS Lion,"Update!!! - Alesis has updated their drivers for Lion, it works great now!!!! Thanks Alesis!!!!This is a great little mixer and I am pleased with the quality for the price. The multi-track recording is really appealing and works well with Windows 7. However, my only real complaint is that there is currently no support for Mac OSX Lion and support for Leapord is only in Beta."
1,Seems great but working correctly,"Seems to be defective.Can only rec with the Main Mix stereo output.Individuals channels give me from no sound to AM radio noise.I've sent an email to Alesis last friday. Almost a week without any reply.I can use it with the Main Mix output only, the price is to high in this case.I was looking to buy more stuff from them, but for now, I've changed my mind."
1,No Windows 7 64 Bit Support,I get no response on when this product will support Windows 7 64-bit. Even the Vista 64 Bit drivers are sketchy.Other than driver support and poor customer service the unit seems fine for a simple 8 channel mixer that should have cost $100 US.I have put this unit back in the box and switched to something will record into Ableton Live 8 on Windows 7 64-bit.
3,Nice Hand Bag,"it's a nice handbag, good quality as always from KathVanZeeLandbut it's little big and too squareiiiiiiii"
4,useful,"this book is very insightful, it offers an often ignored but important perspective on astrological personality types. if you wish to know more about your astrological attributes this is an excellent book to do it with."
3,Save Your Money,"While this book may have had some good information, it was so poorly written it was a labor to continue to read through it; I speed-read through the sections in which I wanted to glean information. I couldn't be done with this book quickly enough. Additionally tedious, was the fact that the kindle edition didn't format the tables so that you could view them without turning your head in a 45 degree angle. Ouch!"
2,A start.... just a start,"Noh...tere!Although this is from a series called ""Talk Now!"" and it's entitled ""Learn Estonian""... it hardly comes close to doing any of that. It only allows you to learn some words, and reinforces them through little games. However, if you wanted to say anything more than a simple phrase or word, this doesn't help you. This would be good for someone who might be visiting Tallinn and wants to impress the natives with a few words in Estonian. But if one seriously wants to learn about this language, even the Colloquial Estonian course is better, coming with tapes that have full sentences and teach some grammar. (although this program has its own weaknesses, too).Even though there is no audio program, the texts from Indiana University's curriculum seems to be the best... if you can get them!Tsau"
5,Steven Prata's C++ Primer Plus is excellent and reusable,"This book is the reason I decided to become a computer scientist. The deepness of information provided, the great examples, and particularly useful exercises were instrumental in getting past my fear of ""coding"". I still use the book from time to time to read over basic c++ concepts that I may have forgotten. It's the best beginner book out there!"
4,Delicious Cookies!,Cookies were as good as they looked! Shared a bunch with friends who loved them as well! Prompt delivery!
5,Great fan,This fan is great! It goes great along with the other green led's I have and my modded case. Even before the modded case I could see a glow out the back of my xbox. I can tell its quieter and I haven't had any red rings or overheating with it. I've had this fan for a couple of months now and it's still working as good as the first day I bought it. I would definitely recommend this fan for anyone wanting to replace theirs instead of getting a loud intercooler.
3,Does It Job - Not Sure if it's Worth an Upgrade?,"So on the ""joyous"" day I received my RROD on my prehistoric Xbox 360, I purchased the infamous Xclamp kit. Realizing it was necessary to finally open and tear apart the console, I figured it was probably time to upgrade the annoyingly loud fan. I decided on this item after favorable reviews and the fact that it had some ""glamour"" to it.Installation was a breeze and thankfully the kit worked. Though after having ran the 360 with the newly installed fan, I'm not sure it runs any faster nor any quieter than the OEM version. The major benefiting factor is the LED lights being displayed from behind the console, which I'm not sure is worth $24+."
4,A GREAT BUY FOR ANY OLD XBOX360!,DOES MOVE MORE AIR NICE & BRIGHT GREEN LEDS.NOT LOUD AT ALL IF YOU KNOW THE RIGHT WAY TO INSTALL!! GOOD SELLER GOT ON TIME NO PROBLEMS AT ALL. BUY IT! IT WORKS!!
4,Nice and Quiet,"I used this as an upgrade to the stock XBOX 360 fan. I'm not a case mod freak, I just wanted better cooling and hopefully a quieter fan. This fan does the job and installs like a charm. I guess the lights are cool, but I really don't spend time looking at the back of my case so i don't notice them much. We'll see how long these last before they get noisey or start to fail."
2,Disappointed on Sound Reduction,"The Whisper fans seem to be the only option for shutting up the stock 360 fans. Unfortunately these aren't that much quieter than the stock fans. The lower end speeds sound a little more quite, but playing games increases the heat and fan speed levels to a point where I can't tell the difference between these and the stock fans. They're all just too loud!Is it possible to create truly quite fans?"
1,A different kind of loud,"So the reason you're looking for a fan called ""Whisper"" is because you are concerned about noise, right? Well in that case, save your money and your warranty. Whisper is just as loud. True, the sound is a little different - I'd say a lower harmonic whine versus the original fan. But just as intrusive.The only good thing I can say about it is that the fan definitely moves more air that the original fans."
1,Maybe Louder?,"This fan is not quieter! I went through all of this, ordering, paying, waiting, opening the xbox! And I think it might be louder. I did not get the one that has a throttle on it but I don't think it would have mattered. It's just as loud, now it's just brighter! Waste of time and money. I think this first reviewer and most on the internet work for talismoon. This is just a Cheap Chinese POS. I may seriously open it back up and reinstall the origional and sell this on ebay, so look out for it."
1,ACE BACKWARDS,This fan exhaust air doesn't intake air. Yes the original xbox fan exhausts but thats why it's bad. You don t stand in the back of a fan to get cool....you stand INFRONT..I will flip it around but now I have to figure out how to mount it now..
3,I wish it whispered; louder than original...,"I was really excited to replace the fan in my Xbox after reading several online tutorials on how to turn down the volume on it's internal parts. This fan was recommended repeatedly, so in my mind it was a no-brainer.Well, I got the darn thing in, which is really quite easy if you have the right tools, only to turn on my unit and be blown away by the huge increase in fan volume. I mean this thing blows. HARD. It should be renamed the vortex fan or the bedside box fan or anything but ""whisper.""I'm going to take apart my Xbox again next weekend to put the old fan back in just to make sure I'm not crazy.Pros:Easy to replace.Generates a lot more airflow.Con:Much louder than original fan."
2,"Interesting stories, but...",Did anyone edit this book? I got the kindle edition and it is barely readable at times due to fractured sentences and grammar.
2,Poor literature,"As an Israeli with experience in israeli military and israeli way of life, I have a ""gut feeling"" the book is (at least major part of it ) is pure imagination.Frankly I was bored to read about countless coffie drinking and sigarete smoking of the author.I couldn't get rid of the impression that he tries hard to ""fill"" the book and heavily relies on magazine articles sometimes word to word ( I red some of them).Thanks god I didn't buy the books ( I spotted the book in the Public library).If you into spy books may be there is some value there, but for god sake, don't buy is ,get it in the library."
4,JET 5 micron bag filter,The original bag filter I cleaned every winter and after 6 years was showing the wear. The new filter apprears to be built studier given two vertical metal cross bars at the open end. Well worth the money to replace given the years of use and excellent air cleaning job in my small 14x20 wood shop attached to the house. My wife never complains about dust getting in the house.
2,Not the quality of the original,The original Jet filter used much better filter fabric. This fabric is very thin and does not appear to be as tight a filter membrane.
1,Garbage,This DVD is a disrespect to true Big & pac fans. I would have give this no stars if i could. The whole thing looks like they did it with a handheld cam and they narrate showing pictures. This was horrible don't buy it. I would have thrown it away if i hadnt paid for it. ~~~GARBAGE~~~
1,complete waste of time & money,"I have bought several of these ""Inside"" DVD's and they all suck - Peter Hammill even warns against this one on his web site - these ""inside"" DVD's are produced without authorization and are narrated by junior journalists who think they are acclaimed rock ""critics"" - the only ones who might be entertained by these DVD's are the so-called critics who STAR in them - A MUST AVOID"
2,My kids wont take them,"We love the Natures plus vitamins, but when I tried switiching over to the Greenz variety the kids wouldnt touch them. They tasted a little too green."
2,What's the point?,"That this is only ""inventory of seven years of OMA's tireless labor"" becomes obvious when you realize that what is presented actually obfuscates OMA's work. If you want book that would clarify their buildings and give you idea why they are one of the leading architectural studios, look elsewhere."
4,Female Encyclopedia Brown,"Angie's older sister is a police officer, working hard to solve two crimes. First, a gang of teenagers is robbing homes in the area and there's also a ring of counterfeiters at work. Angie's goal is to solve one or both cases so her sister can get promoted to sergeant. She and her friend Jess patrol the neighborhood on the lookout for suspicious activity. They get more than they bargained for.Sobol, author of the wildly popular Encyclopedia Brown books, tries his hand with a female heroine and a mystery that's longer than a chapter. He does marginally well with this venture, although young children reading this book might get in quite a bit more trouble than Angie does if they try to emulate her."
3,Angie's first case,"This book is okay. Angie Zane, the main character thinks she is really smart, but she gets caught by the enemy 2 times. That doesn't really happen to detecives. Jess Berg, Angie's friend is a really fuuny character. My favorite part is when Angie and Jess are caught by the Wolf Gang. They get tied up, Blindfolded and gagged. Donald Sobol made this a really good book. A part in this book i thought was wierd is when Angie is tied up and gagged with dish towels. and she can't even untie herself. That is really pathetic. Remember, the parts of the book i wrote about in this review are not crucial to the plot. So you can still read the book and be suprised. Overall, this is a good book."
1,Great Idea Poorly Executed,I strongly recommend you avoid these and the fact that Feit has continued selling these things suggests to me that they are a company to avoid!!The bulbs overheat and are short-lived. There is not consistency in the way the bulbs fit in holders. Sometimes a bulb will fit properly and make good contact in one holder and not in others. Often they lose contact and flicker or go out and they have to be carefully adjusted by turning them slightly. I removed these several months ago after having fought them for about 4 years. I bought replacement bulbs or complete units 4 different times over that time. There has been no detectable improvement.Very satisfied with led strips purchased from Amazon that these were replaced with. I cut strips from 5 meter rolls. We found that it required 2 parallel strips to give adequate light. This solution does require a little wiring and soldering.
2,Burn out to quickly,I had nine and now I am down to 4I just replace 2 that had only been in for 2 months
3,expensive replacements - short life,"Lights work well and look good for the most part. In cold weather they are noticably dimmer until they warm up. Unfortunately, they have a short life and turning them off and on frequently seems to aggravate the problem. I've had two sets and so far replacements mean buying a whole new kit, not just the bulb. At $10-12 each they are expensive and I find that at least annual replacements are needed. If a cool, low voltage light is needed, I'd recommend using some form of LED."
1,Extremely short life,"I installed these units (originally purchased from Lowes) under my Kitchen cabinets. I thought fluorescent lights would have a long life. Instead, these expensive bulbs have about 1/3 the life of a standard 40 W incandescent lamp. I am spending a fortune buying replacement bulbs. Also, these must be the hottest fluorescent bulbs I have ever seen. They will discolor the inside of the cabinet they are mounted to, they are so hot!"
2,Under counter light system,The bulbs are too expensive and they don't last very long; besides they are too dificult to fine plus some don't fit as well as the should ; they tend to work loose.Theo McCracken
5,Feit Electric 9 Watt Under cabinet Light,"In an effort to replace a bulb in my built-in under cabinet lighting, I ordered this unit. The bulb did not fit. Be careful when using this company as my bulbs seem to obsolete even though they were installed less than 5 years ago. I was able to purchase them two years ago."
3,A bit disappointing,"I own a couple of Prada pieces and I must admit, this one went back. There is nothing great about this bag-- it's actually a regular canvas tote! Sure, I don't know what I was expecting but from Prada, maybe a bit more than this--- perhaps a little better quality on the handles and the color scheme does not work. Oh well, better luck next time. Must say, Amazon customer service is truly wonderful."
4,Good book,"Great recipes, good pictures. Fun to make, but time consuming. A few need special equipment that is hard to find, but over all a great book for christmas cookies."
2,"Pictures are great, but recipes not as easy as they appear","I was really excited to add some new christmas cookie recipes when I bought this book. My husband and I narrowed our choices down to four of the recipes in this book.So far, the two that we made have not gone well.For the Orange Snowballs, they tell you to roll the cookies in the orange sugar mixture AFTER you bake them. Well, the sugar doesn't stick. We ended up having to baste them in a little butter to get the sugar to stick. They look ugly now. PLUS, the recipe says that they make 48 balls. I made my snowballs the exact size they specified, and only got 29!Then, we made the pinwheel snickerdoodles. The cookie dough is not made for rolling, no matter how long you chill it!So far, I wouldn't recommend this book. The pretty pictures of the cookies are very decieving."
1,Worst book EVER,"This book is one of the worst books I have ever read, the author has no idea what's going on in LOST the portrayal of the characters is so off the mark that's it laughable I was so disappointed in this book that I actually threw it out in the rubbish bin. If you like LOST and need something to do in-between seasons or episodes bang you head against the wall it would be a far better use of your time"
3,Another Lost Book,It was a good read but I didn't enjoy it as much as Cathy Hapka's 2 Lost books. Anyone who has read Cathy's 2 Lost books and liked them would probably enjoy it.
3,Good item,Only problem I've had with this unit is that it continues to fall out of the socket. Constantly! Not a good fit. It's not the only one that does that.
1,"Great Service, poor product",The product broke the first day I used it. I'm going to have to be more careful. I think they are all cheep.
3,Good Read but Marred by Numerous Errors,"This book was definitely interesting to read, but being a long-time fan of pro-wrestling I didn't learn a lot from it. There are numerous errors in the book, too numerous to list. The author's choice of wrestlers to write about is a little strange - No lenglth mention of Eddie Guerrero, Ricky Steamboat, The Steiner Brothers, Juventud Guerra, Billy Kidman, Booker T, etc. No ECW, Japanese or Mexican wrestlers (referring to promotion, not race) are profiled.However, for beginning fans of pro-wrestling, this book is definitely a good read. You won't notice the errors but will learn a lot about the way the business works.A good read, but a lot of the information is available for free if you look around on the internet."
3,"Product is as pictured, and not OEM","I've replaced the filters on our Sears humidifier numerous times. I thought I'd be getting the same OEM product as previously. However, the filters I received appear as pictured, and are not the same as the original, despite labeling. I don't yet know how well they will work. Perhaps they are better (?), but it wasn't what I was expecting. Dry, they are smaller than the specified dimensions and don't fully fill the air flow path; however, I've verified that they expand to fill the space when wet. The vendor has agreed to replace or refund if they don't work properly. I'll test them this winter and will update my review (if I remember!)"
2,Lions Tigers and Bears,Purchased for sole purpose of obtaining words to Lions Tigers and Bears out there. It is only briefly mentoned--so still do not have full verse of this; have not found on web either.
5,Skilled relating at your fingertips,"Want to create an intimate and positive relationship, this is the book to purchase. Gay and Kathlyn Hendricks have insights and suggestions, which, if applied consistently, can transform relationships and give you the confidence needed to deal with relationship difficulties. I have taught from this book and had people give me examples of how the application of the ideas has changed their life for the better. Personally, when I apply the various suggestions my relationship always improves and gets back on track. It is a easy read. Love it."
1,Cheesy,"This book started off good, but then went into some very CHEESY details and accounts of people who tried the subconscious mind tricks. (for example - numerous examples of people thinking hard about winning the lottery and waking up with Ed McMahon at their door... or overcoming cancer by thinking about it hard enough). Not convincing at ALL."
1,Deeply disappointing,"A bizarre misstep by an otherwise brilliant singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist. Check out her albums Joyride or Fly Stereophonic, both of which are superb. Avoid this one and help encourage Ms. Husik to use her considerable powers for good -- not evil."
3,It's not bad.,"Symphonic Music of Yes isn't bad. I admit that I would have preferred it if these songs from Yes had been performed only by orchestral instruments (That's not meant to be a slight against Yes.). I just feel that Symphonic Music of Yes would have been much better as a total orchestral work. That aside, there's still some good stuff on this disc. ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"" sounds quite interesting. ""Survival"" and ""Soon"" are also good. The rest of the material isn't bad, either. Jon Anderson, Steve Howe, and Bill Bruford contribute to this album. Other musicians that haven't played with Yes help out, also. The two orchestras that perform on seperate songs are The London Philharmonic Orchestra and The English Chamber Orchestra. The London Community Gospel Choir also performs on a couple of tracks (""I've Seen All Good People"" and ""Survival""). This album is mixed in Dolby Surround Sound. It's worth a listen."
3,Some really nice moments...,"It's difficult not to snicker at the thought of having a symphony orchestra ""slumming it"" by deigning to arrange rock music...even rock as intricate as Yes's. I'm a major Yes fan, and I purchased this CD a few years ago. Even though I respected Jon Anderson, Steve Howe and Bill Bruford as all great talents, I was skeptical that this album would be more than elevator music, and sure, about half of the album isn't very interesting.However, I was pleasantly surprised by this album's version of ""Survival."" It's truly breathtaking. You would never have imagined how beautiful it sounds here from hearing the version the group did back in the '60s...the vocal choir sing like angels on this track. There are other songs on the album to recommend a purchase from committed fans, as well."
5,Very useful book,I have found this book very interesting. It is plenty of useful information to understand and and to maintain discus.
2,Just OK,"This is one of the most up to date discus books, but it is really not that informative for a beginner to the breed. It does offer pics of some of the newer strains, but is not the complete reference it claims it is."
2,Not really about discus fish,"I purchased this book as a reference for discus. Instead, it went through all of the details of setting up a fish tank, something one should be well informed about before even attempting to set up a discus tank.Some of the information seemed contradictory or incorrect. The sections about discus were short and not detailed. This is not the book for any serious discus owner or owner-to-be."
5,"Some Girls are geniuses, some girls are not.","I think the only reason I was intrigued by this record and decided to give it a spin was because I read repeatedly that there was no reason. Much like Liars' ""They Were Wrong, So We Drowned,"" but for different reasons, many find both albums to be unlistenable. But Some Girls' second album is a far improvement from their first, ""All My Friends Are Going Death,"" and pretty much put on display their utter disgust with everything from virgins to pinata's.Grinding gears from top to bottom and clocking in at a whopping 24:23 (this is mathematically shorter than a sitcom when found on DVD) including a nine minute track. Some Girls strip their vocals and put their stamp on of the songs, and destroy the glass that has been broken over their heads. The Liars album is similar, and also chastised incorrectly on false reasoning. Oddly, the Liars and Some Girls are very similar, buton pushing and barrier breaking. But I still like the reviews better that chastise."
5,California apricots are the better sweeter apricots,"94 yr-old mother ""in law"" will only accept apricots from California which are not that easy to find in South Florida. The purchase through Amazon was easy and specific for California, and Mother was very happy this Christmas. She knew right away that these apricots were from California and not The Middle East."
5,MaxEffect Agrees: This Is A MUST READ For Yellow Page Advertisers!,"I've been personally involved with Yellow Page ad design for 30 years. I know from experience that the information in Kerry's book will practically guarantee your success in this unique medium. I've been preaching very similar Yellow Page design strategies and have enjoyed increased response rates for my clients of 30% to 800%. Buy it once, read it a few times, then sit back and get ready to answer lots of phone calls. This is by far the most intelligent and valuable Yellow Page advertising manual available."
1,No Value At All,"New York lawyers know this - and I have been a lawyer for over twenty years, it is so clear that yellow page advertising is a extinct medium. If you don't have the page priority nor the money to spend on the right books - your'e dead in the water past page five. It's the Internet that really counts today not the yellow pages....The book had some OK points - but it is really out-of-touch with reality. It was also very expensive!! For a good read on law firm promotion buy David Maisters work - it's really great stuff"
5,one of the best CD's you never heard,"I agree with the first reviewer, once you hear this CD you'll love it. Someone else should cover these songs so they don't get lost to obscurity. Great songwriting, instrumentation, and vocals. Take a chance and buy a copy."
5,SAC IN FULL EFFECT,I have to fully agree with djkayz78 on this one this is one of the best cds of 2005. I just got this CD yesterday and I will probably be listening to this for a very very long time. the beats have that dope early ninties feel to them and if you are a fan of THE PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS you must check this group out. Thes One even produces a track plus for the cheap price tag what have you got to lose. They have a great sense of humor I dare you to listen to the song Saggy pants with a straight face. SAC exude that rare kind of energy on tracks that is sadly absent in 90% of all rap music today man this is the perfect joint to blow off some steam to after a long day at work. I am suprised that more people do not know about this group because this joint is off the hook. 10 MICS
5,redefined jazz-rap,"even though it's new school. it has that jazz that takes you back to 1991. this album redefines jazz-rap. this album is excellent in every aspect. a cool, soulful mix of hip hop and jazz. definately 5-plus stars. a landmark album. so buy this album like i'm going to."
3,damn this is ok,well i have to say they have good beats but i can t stand the rap style. i mean its alll hype if your rappin over jazz samples you have to have one guy whos got a smooth delivery and tone
3,Never 'wow'd' me,"overall a good release, just never really impressed me. I liked the production more than the style of the mc's. they sound alot like early j5, probably too much for my taste."
5,You go to love this one!,"I got this CD at a store closing sale. Saw the label was Fat Beats so I gave it a chance. This is Hip Hop! Beats, lyrics,and incredible DJ mixing! I will be checking for this group in the future!"
1,Vapid Collection of re-tread,"Much of the same old singer-songwriter predictable content. Nothing here stands out and that's precisely the problem with Nashville...conservative, predictable and clogged up with useless tradion."
1,Vapid Collection of re-tread,"Much of the same old singer-songwriter predictable content. Nothing here stands out and that's precisely the problem with Nashville...conservative, predictable and clogged up with useless traditional brainlessness."
3,"Good video, but buy the instructional DVD first...","This is a great motivator and demonstrational tool of bodyweight exercises, but it's usefulness for instruction only applies if you bought the instructional DVD as well. The last reviewer made a good point that this could've done better as a bonus to the instructional DVD. but it is what is. Unless you can do the exercises here, you're just spectating. For what it does, it's great. The moves are pretty self-explanatory, just do it like they did. With the help of the beginner DVD, you can one day work up to doing these exercises."
3,"Demonstration, not instructional","While I will admit that the models in this video have awesome bodies, this video is not an instructional one it is a demonstration of what they can do; which is why I can only give it 3 stars. Their builds are worth much, much more. The DVD does not teach you how to achieve what they have achieved. They don't speak during the video; there's just music and rap playing in the back ground. Some of the rap is a little too much for me.They have produced an instructional video that you can get for their site. I am considering purchasing it although I think this one should have been a bonus feature of their workout video. However, If I can achieve anything close to what they have using their program and my own body weight, any price would be worth it."
5,Unbelievable sensitivity and musicality,"Wunderlich's last concert is remarkable apart from the fact that it is his last. His Dichterliebe is much more expressive than any of his previous recordings of the work. And hats off to Hubert Giesen, his accompanist, who shows such masterful interpretive skills during the work that I can hardly pay attention to Fritz sometimes! These two artists are so in-tune with each other during this recital, and their expressivity astounds me. His encore pieces include Ungeduld and An Die Musik--both are exquisite and have something extra that none of his studio recordings could really portray. The ""live recording"" element of this recital launches this CD into a new realm for me...I just cannot praise it enough. If only I could have been there!"
4,A good story,"Rosamund is the daughter of a peasant and a nobleman as everyone in her village believes.She is doomed to marry the village blacksmith's son when a twist of fate takes her to Ravenscrag castle where she masquerades as the bethrothed of Lord Henry who she recognizes as the man of her dreams even though he does not know her.Henry believes that a wife is only for the begetting of heirs,there should be no passion or love between them to Rosamund's dismay.He continues to keep a mistress after he marries her until he realizes that he loves her.A ghost from Rosamund's past the involvement in black magic of Henry's mistress and also the subsequent revelation of Rosamund's secret kept this story interesting to the end."
3,It had everything there to make it 5 stars BUT,"There is something lacking in the author's presentation. She's creative, all right, and the plot is a strong one (illegitimate heroine impersonating her dead sister; hero struggles not to fall in love with her; he has an ex-mistress who's a genuine witch). The setting is exciting (the War of the Roses). But it's all rather flat. I found it annoying that the heroine was kidnapped not less than three times by her old fiance! The hero admits his love for the heroine pretty quickly into the story, which is both good & bad...it's nice that he's not concealing his feelings til the bitter end, like most heroes do, but it's also boring to hear them pledge their love over & over & over. It's a good enough read, but not a keeper."
1,So disjointed,"A bunch of quasi-authors get together to write a book that ends up being less than useful because one hand doesn't know what the other is doing. Some sections are better than others, but the overall result is still quite poor. Full of errata, mistakes, oversights, and shoddy editing - stay away from this book unless you find it at the deep discount bin for next to nothing.I hope these guys learn a lesson (whoever runs these books now) and learn not to hire a whole slew of article writers to make a book. They're almost never good this way."
1,"Good HD video, not very ""wild""","First, be aware that Hawaiian Tropic helped (or at least seemed to help) produce this title, so do NOT expect to see any nude coeds. The HD quality is very good, and all of the colors jump off of the screen and and clear. The overall topic is about the ""party"" during spring break in Ft. Lauderdale. The production crew also went to Acapulco to show the viewer the ""party"" going on there."
1,LIGHT,"DID NOT LIGHT UP ANYTHING IN FRONT OF THE TRUCK,HAD TO TAKE THEM OFF AND BUY ANOTHER SET OF LIFHTS,THIS TIME K/C."
3,Look good,"These lights look good but you get what you pay for these are low budget lights you can tell as soon as you bolt on. I painted the brackets black and bought stainless bolts to replace the bolts supplied. The light is good about what I expected (I replaced my stock JK fog lights with a pair of pilot 4"") that is why I gave these a try. The harness was way to short for my application on 2010 jeep. For the cost they probably deserve 4 stars losing only for the short harness. If you want decent looking lights on a low budget these are worth a look."
2,Dried apricots,"I was very disappointed when I received my order of these apricots, as they do not resemble the picture at all. I realize that the sun-drying process must be what makes their color such a dingy brown, but they also seem very dry. I believe that they are probably healthier for me than the store-bought variety of dried apricots which I've bought in the past, so I will use them all, but they are not appealing."
2,Lake Dye,"Crystal Blue Lake and Pond Dye was purchased to keep moss from growing in my lake. It turned the water blue for about 3 weeks and was pretty, but it faded away. It didn't stop the moss from growing. If you don't mind pouring it in your lake pretty often, it really makes the water a pretty blue. I bought some Curtine-plus to stop the moss and it worked, but doesn't turn the water blue like Crystal Blue does. I just wish it would last longer."
1,misled..,"When I received the package the bottle was about one third full. It was wrapped in a plastic bag and tied, there was no leakage in the packing material so I KNOW whoever packed it for shipment knew it was NOT a full gallon. I bought the dye for my son who owns 2 3 acre ponds and WAS a potentially very good loyal customer. This was my first and LAST order from this company!!"
1,"Overpromised, Underdelivered","Thank goodness I didn't buy the book - I borrowed it from a library, and promptly returned it within 3 days. To be fair, the first few introductory chapters were quite useful, but the usefulness stopped there. The following chapters on trendlines, fibonacci levels - these are not new terms to me, but I felt the author didn't make any effort to connect. I tried again to re-read some sections, but gave up. It was obscure, and there was a lot of rambling which totally lost me. Maybe it's me... Anyway, I found other sources online that explained the concepts a lot better."
3,"Big Title, but nothing in the book...","I bought three forex books to read, I left this one for last because I think it will be the best because of the title. Other words, the meat and the gravy. After reading the first two books, I could have written this one myslef, the CD don't even work. Big title, but no nitigity detail. I think they should change the title to ""Forex For Dummies"". If you need a good Forex book, buy Forex Revolution.Horace,"
4,A great starting resource in ForEx,"I bought this book 6m ago and have frequently gone back to thumb through while trying demo accounts (on my 3rd demo acct now and barely breaking even!) :)The book is written in a very simple and easy to follow guidelines for ForEx trading and provides all the basic info that you need to enter the exciting ForEx market.The trading system that Raghee uses is definitely useful, however, it takes time to identify the right set-up (and to avoid the false alarms).Only reason the book got 4 starts from me rather than 5 is lack of adequate coverage on backtesting resources. I still have to find an easy software platform for backtesting that would not cost me a fortune."
2,Not really worth the money,"This book is as good as any for an introduction but their are many just as good for a great deal less money. The book has numerous type o's and the author, that claims to be a teacher but should claim to be a sales person for esignal, carries on to points that seem to lead no where and forget understandable examples. The examples in this book are like Einstein saying E=MC2, because energy= mass x the speed of light squared. You just feel like well that didn't explain anything. Foget about that waste of time website that's just an ad forum and the CD, which was a reason I bought this book is just as much a waste as the rambles that fill pages of the book to make it seem like you might have gotten your monies worth. Trust me if you have half a brain you will find this book a huge waste of time."
3,"Mixed Review of Horner's ""Forex Trading for Maximum Profit""","After all of the hype that I read surrounding this book, I was pretty disappointed with its content. The charts too small to be read easily, and the spelling and punctuation errors were more than I cared for.The book does give a brief overview of the Forex market, but I was hoping for something more. The author does do a good job of describing her method of trading the market. I must admit that while I was reading the book, I was thinking that her methods seemed just too simple to be effective. However, the day after I finished reading the book, I found and successfully traded both a swing trade and a momentum trade using her techniques. The results were a gain of 30 pips on the swing trade and 75 pips on the momentum trade! This book has definitely given me another way to look for trades and I will continue to follow her ""Three-Step Setup""."
4,A good skills sharpener,"First the bad part: Ms. Horner needs a new editor!!!! This book is full every kind of writing error there is - grammer, spelling, syntax, sentence structure - you name it. But once I got over that, I found this book to be quite helpful. The book helped me to refocus on the basics of technical trading; namely, support and resistance, the mental processes involved in entering and exiting trades, and getting confirmation from other indicators before entering a trade. These are not new techniques, but they can be lost or forgotten in the daily grind of trading. The book did introduce me to a couple of new indicators, which I look forward to experimenting with. I am an experieced trader, and I'm not sure if a beginner would get enough out of this book to develop a comprehensive trading technique, but it would certainly help. It is user-friendly and easy to read. In short, it has had a positive effect on my trading."
3,Fair Book,"This was the first forex book I bought,at that time it seemed very interesting,the system seemed very simple at a glance but after playing around with it I realise this was not for me.If you are new to forex it's a good start,not knocking the book it did arouse my interest to seek out other books.The momentum brake out is Raghee favorite pattern,for me the 34 EMA is to far away from the market. A better combo is 8/20 SMA.Knowing how to use this combo will yield better results"
1,smarmy come-on,"Have you seen the smarmy come-ons for shonky products? Sometimes advertised on TV or radio. With a free 800 phone number you can call, for free material. Sounds promising, you think. But then when the literature arrives, it's little more than a push to buy the ""premium"" stuff. That is what Horner's book feels like. She waffles all over the place, with interminable babble about the greatness of her method. Yet a careful parsing of the book shows little substance. All the while ""subtly"" mentioning her website with the hot stuff. Bait and switch.Well, you could save some money and avoid this book. But unlike some others who suggested you visit her website and drop $400, I would recommend also avoiding it. Given the vapidness of the book, it is not a good precursor."
4,Very solid easy to read book,"Let me say that I have been using Raghee's strategies for momentum based trades with lots of success. I bought the book quite a while ago and waited to write this review so I could try the strategies out first.Good Points:1. Clear strategy for momentum trading with multiple examples2. Few strategy rules so is easy to implement3. Most charting packages support the tools the book recommendsBad Points:1. I found swing trading strategies a little confusing (hence the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars)Finally, don't be put off by the editing errors. They are definitely there but they do not detract from the usefullness of the book.Good Luck in Trading.Bad"
1,A terribly expensive brochure-an affront to financial literature,Any other book you buy on forex is going to be better than this one. You'll be left wondering how it is that the author could possibly feel that this is going to benefit anyone (except herself). A real disappointment. If I could have rated it less than 1 star I would have.
1,Absolutely appalling.,"I have read numerous books on Forex trading and this ranks amongst the worst.This is a sham and is designed in duping wannabees into partubg with their hard earned cash.The tools mentioned in this book are available free on many websites and the strategies are too simplistic (in a bad way)Good luck with implementing them but by the time you do, the event will have been and gone!"
1,waste of time,"Apart from the fact that the editor of this book should be fired, I'm not convinced that the strategy will work. The author claims to be trading the forex markets, and her students can ""smell a wannabe trader from a mile"" but I'm not sure if she really is a wannabe trader or a real trader.There are no trading data or anything to back up the author's claims. The only reason I'm giving it 1 star is because it might be of some use to a novice trader."
1,Easier to write books than to trade,"This is a basic ""This is how you can trade the forex"" not a how you do trade the forex. It seems more theoretical then actually practiced. I think you can find much of the same information on the internet for free. It seems like it is much easier to sell a book throw in some charts then to actually trade the forex. This is certainly the feel I get. The bible of forex I highly doubt it."
3,FX market is very very risky individuals,"I have not read this book. But the title of the book suggest that you can make easy money by trading FX. That is totally misleading. The FX market is very specualtive in the small to medium term, And in the long term you are better off with FX deposits if you are sure of the directional trend."
1,Garbage! A Monstrosity!,"This author has no reason to sell you all her best trading secrets, but she does have a reason to successfully market a dream and make a killing from unsuspecting buyer's hopes and dreams. The ""information"" in this book is very vague and incomplete, leaving the reader at a complete loss on trying to learn how to forecast the forex market. Not only does the author tease the reader with bits and pieces of her secret strategy that do not fit together, but the writing in the book is so poor you'd think that a juvenile delinquent wrote the book on a Sunday night for a class project due on Monday. If you want to throw money away, buy this book. Otherwise you'd have better luck in the forex market by throwing darts at currency bills and investing in those."
3,A come on to sell you her propriatary items,"The book in general was fun to read but very lacking in any real technical analysis. The author simply uses a modified version of channels which she then purports as the end all in support resistance, entry and exits. If you want to get the indicators she uses they will cost you another 400 dollars! I thought this was a very tacky attempt at promoting herself. To me her book is just a way for her to build up her own trading account."
2,Save your money...,"Save your money on thsi book, it seems alll her books talks of the same techniques. If you read one of her books or found stuff on her methods on the web, no need to purchase any other books by this author, they seems to be all rehash."
1,Total Ripoff,This book is a total ripoff. It contains no practical information on trading forex. I paid full retail for the book and was very disapointed with it. The Abe Cofnas Home Study book is a much better book.
3,Read between the lines.,"It seems that a lot of people expect that books meant to be an introduction to forex trading should reveal precise secrets on how they can immediately become wealthy. Raghee is apparently quite successful as a Forex Trading Mentor. Although I have no personal experience with her training programs I was interested to learn what she has to say about the Forex market and did not expect that she would attempt to reveal everything she knows in a book. First of all, it would not be possible because learning to trade Forex requires ongoing mentoring and interaction with mentors over a period of months to years. Second of all, those who are interested in learning more will consider actual mentoring programs and/or getting to know people who are already successful in the business of trading. Therefore I would give Raghee the credit she is due for writing this book as an introduction to help people decide if further training is right for them."
1,I want my time back,"I bought the book for the good title, when i was i dumb newbie in the markets, and even then when i read the book i could not believe the dumb stupidity useless piece of crap this book it is, this is the dumbest book for trading in no just the forex market, but any market ever made, the people who gave this book more than one star to this book is because they were paid or are the author friends or did it herself.I am angry no because i paid money for this book, but because i will never be available to get back the time that i waste reading this useless crap.BTW that was years ago, thankfully now i know how the markets really work, and to open your eyes, the forex markets is one of the most difficult markets in the world, one example, Warren buffet once he lost 850 m, George Soros, around 650 m, use your little peanut (brain) next time you buy a book about the markets. Got to make sense.I gave the book one star because i couldn't gave 0 star"
5,early warning system,"This device makes it possible to know when someone is at my door before the door knock or bell. If The music is too high or the TV is to loud , I know when someone is at the door ... Love this device... works flawlessly....Totally recommend......."
1,This product only fits the '01-'05 Kia Rio.,"Although Amazon's website says it will fit an '06 or later model, it does not. I ordered from amazon so I could have the ventshades overnighted (I'm an Amazon Prime member so it only cost me $4 to have it overnighted). I could have got it much cheaper on ebay if I didn't mind waiting. Plus, ebay has pics of the CORRECT item for the '06 and later Rio on the car. My advise is to buy it on ebay."
5,Crimson Moon is one of the most beautiful unknown songs ever written,"Bert Jansch is among those extraordinary artists who are popularly unknown, but technically accomplished far beyond popular comprehension. In addition, Jansch's body of work is beautiful and memorable, but few can cover his songs as well as him for its technical precision is demanding and Janc's execution is effortless and simultaneously unapproachable. Jansch works in the oldest tradition of a troubadour singer-songwriter.This collection is an excellent introduction to Jansch's work, and for those who've never heard it, I suggest listening to ""Crimson Moon"" if you want to be hooked.These re-masters are crystal clear and welcome new pressings of beloved songs."
4,Simply Moving!,This is an example of how an orchestra can swing!David Palmer and Tull members shine on moving numbers like Elegy and Fly By Night.The symphonic treatment of Locomotive Breath and Aqualung is something special for Tull lovers to hear.Music lovers in general will really like this great sounding album.
4,enjoyable,"whimsical renditions performed nicely, in my humble opinion. Not all rock-meets-classical projects are this well-conceived or executed.I enjoy it."
2,I guess you can't be good ALL the time.,"A friend of mine once said, ""Sometimes the London Symphony Orchestra isn't the London Symphony Orchestra"" in reference to soundtrack work, referring to the fact (?) that the actual music you hear in the film isn't always what you get on the album that IS performed by the LSO.""A Classic Case"" makes me wonder if that goes for released recordings as well. While the concept of the London Symphony Orchestra doing Jethro Tull SHOULD be really, really cool, the end result is so limp it's as if one is stuck in an elevator listening to the Muzak. It's better-than-average Muzak, but it still doesn't rise above that level. The brass section is particularly pathetic.The only tracks which have any interesting qualities to them is the rendition of ""Too Old for Rock n Roll; Too Young To Die"" and ""War Child."" Every other track is lifeless and plodding. It's almost like listening to a university orchestra with an uninspired arrenger and a tired conductor."
3,Had Potential,"This is one of those pieces that leave you wondering, ""What might have been."" Great concept, but just ""ok"" excecution. I bought this when it first came out and have gone back to it again from time to time. In some places it really is unique and shows great orchestration: War Child is great and the opening of Locomotive Breath is powerful. Not a bad CD to round out your Tull collection, but by no means a ""must have""."
2,Really poor,"David Palmer did a lot of imaginative string and orchestral arrangements for Jethro Tull back in their early days; his work on the Tull standard ""A Christmas Song"" is a particular high point. But these ""symphonic interpretations"" of rock never really work and this album is no exception. The arrangements of Tull greats like ""Locomotive Breath"" and ""Living In The Past"" are leaden-footed and the LSO sounds like the Boston Pops on a particularly bad night. Palmer would be better served either conducting or writing some original works that don't stem from a rock background. When he tries to put a rock heart into a classical body, the result is DOA."
1,missed opportunity,"As others have stated, this album had the potential of being something really special, but is lifeless and cheesey instead.Ironic that, it's the presence of the Tull band that ruined it for me."
4,A really good selection of music,"This is one of the best Anime CD's I've ever listened to. The only thing that bothered me is that there seemed to be a lot of other good songs missing. I just hope they will come out with a second volume! This is a really good CD and if your are an Anime fan, I suggest you get this!"
5,The best domestic Anime complilation CD,"The best of Anime CD, is a great disc. It has some old and new songs, Some of which have not been released in the states before, not including imports.More than half the songs on the disc i already have on other CDs, But it is very nice to have them on one Disc. If you Are a Anime fan, And love the music of the different series, Then buy this CD now, At this price you can't go wrong.I have just one more thing to say, And that is Rhino should make The best of Anime a series of discs, Don't just make this one volume, make several ones, With more non-domestic anime music and if possible some BGM music as well.But like as i said before, this is a must have CD for Anime fans."
4,otaku's delight,"This collection is just great to listen to where ever you are- home, work or on the road. From Cutey Honey and Oh My Goddess to Speed Racer and Sailor Moon, it is a collection that an anime fan shouldn't be without.When I first listened to many of the songs on here, I wanted to buy their respective shows! I still do, in fact. You won't be disappointed if you get this album."
3,Great vocalist but overproduced recording,"Karen's singing is always beautiful but some of the tracks are unoriginal and boring standard fare and the production is over the top. What should have been a simple, intimate folk recording got crowded with track on track of backup R & B musicians"
4,Awkward Genius,"Some great music snuck through the singer-songwriter major label wasteland of the 1970's and this is one those rare damaged jewels which defy categorization and transcends time. Not for everyone, but if you get it, you got it."
1,karen dalton,"karen had a voice that sounded like a cross between kermit the frog from the muppets and that dude from canned heat. painful to listen. i wish i could honor her memory by sayin her album sounded awesome~but her voice was so grating that i have to call out the ""sacred cow""."
2,Hmmmmm.,Musically solid - vocally ? As I listen to it I picture Cheech and Chong trying to jump from a moving van as this hitch hiker tries to prove her star quality.
1,Say the unthinkable...,"I suppose I'll have to be the one to say it: Dalton sounded like what she was, a hopeless drunk. The 'phrasing' you're hearing is due to her heroic consumption. She should not have been allowed near a microphone, particularly to murder 'In a Station' by Richard Manuel of The Band: OK It might have sent him a royalty payment but someone else should have sung while Dalton strummed.I managed to sell off my copy of this album. Don't believe the hype. This is dreadfull."
4,A terrific book,"I read this book when I was nine or ten. Now I'm reading the Little House novels. But I still remember how much I loved the chapter books, especially this one. It tells about Laura Ingalls and her adventures with her dog, Jack. I got really sad when the family lost Jack while crossing a river on their way to Kansas, and they thought he had died. But I loved when that night, an animal came to where the Ingalls were. It had bright eyes, and they thought it was a wolf! It turned out that the ""wolf"" was Jack! He hadn't died after all! The book told of lots of other adventures Laura had with Jack. I recommend this book to girls seven to ten. If you read this book, I know you'll enjoy it."
5,Best Of The West,"I bought this cookbook along with 4 or 5 other cowboy/chuck wagon style cookbooks on Amazon. Of them all, this one is by far the pick of the litter. It is not only filled with a whole bunch of finger licking good old time recipes from beans and bacon to trailside stew, but its also chock full of all kinds of rare pictures and facts about our favorite TV westerns and movies from televisions golden age. Its fun, interesting, delicious, and well worth your money. No wonder it has become hard to find. There isn't another like it here or anywhere else I have found. Dang burn it.....Go for it!!!!!"
2,Product is very poorly made.,Rounded hammer heads look like they were done by hand on a bench grinder. The handles aren't wood like they show in the picture. You have to use your imagination to make all the pieces fit in the plastic case provided.
2,just business,This is a tale about a man who signed a business contract but did not want to adhere to it. Overly long for what is just a bad business practice and not enough about how to build a robot IMHO.
4,Very good,"This video is very good. For people wanting to exercise at a intermediate level, it's perfect, you sweat a lot but feel energized in the end. It would not recommend it to Tae Bo beginners."
1,Geesh Billy really???,I do taebo as a fill in with strength training and I enjoy them usually. This one however..................... come on!!!!The patterns ofthe steps are so complicated that Billy and his little blonde chicky screw them up. No thanks. This went directly into the garage sale pile.
2,Meh,"Usually a fan of the tae Bo workouts but this one is boring , the movements are so repetitive and basic and it doesn't feel challenging"
5,Great exercise book! to accompany Halmos' Naive Set Theory,Paul Halmos' widely known book on set theory--Naive Set Theory actually has an exercise book to accompany it (Like Michael Spivak's Calculus). THe book is written by L.E. Sigler. It has an excellent source of problems. Will enhance your experience studying Halmos'...
3,DEFINITELY COULD BE BETTER!,"As a novice to the Portuguese Language, I purchased this program to learn basic words and phrases. Though the software accomplished this purpose, the problem I had was that there is no lesson that teaches the sounds of the Brazilian Alphabets. If you are looking to learn basic Brazilian Portuguese words, then this program will suffice. However, this program is not for a student who is seriously seeking to learn Brazilian Portuguese."
5,Great Entrance Exam Refresher,"I received this book 2 weeks before my college entrance exam to smooth over what I momentarily learned in high school--I Do not want to end up in a lower than Calculus math class, paying for a class that does not give me any college credit.So far I have been getting through a chapter each day, in about hour and a half of on and off study.It is continuing to get me more comfortable with my math skills in a very short time. I Recommend it to anyone who fears there college entrance exam, or interested in learning Precalc on their own."
3,DOES NOT cover all pre-calculus topics!,"I didn't do enough research before buying this book, but after receiving this book, I've found out that it doesn't cover nearly all off the topics in pre-calculus. For example, it is missing Vectors and Parametric Equations. So, I would not recommend this book if you are taking an Honors Pre-cal course, as this book will disappoint you."
