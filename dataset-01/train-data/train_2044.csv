4,One of the most well written Series.,"This is one of the best series ever, and watching it ""Marathon Style"" is even better. I grew up going to NYC during the time it takes place, and they really have done a good job with the details.I don't usually own many DVDs or watch things over and over, but I wanted to share watching this with some friends and family, who missed it on TV.I ended up seeing things I missed the first time. The writing is so succinct. There are no superfluous scenes or dialogue. The acting and characters are superb."
3,Not as sharp as the first season,"This series still provides compelling viewing but some of the edge of the first season has worn off.We are back in the heart of Madison Ave in 1962 but the action in this series spreads out into the characters' lives outside the office. It's become a soap opera. What made the first season so enjoyable was seeing the ad men at work, creating their products. Now we get a lot of marital strife, affairs, breakups, a weird back-story and other stuff that's way less interesting.One plus is the way the writers depict the frustrations of women. You see the roots of women's liberation before it even has a name. You feel it in the boredom and wasted potential and in the blind disregard of men.I'll continue watching and hoping this series doesn't jump the shark too soon. But the danger is there."
2,"Great Show, Terrible Blu-Ray","Season Two of Mad Men is brilliant, and it needs to be to get through this terrible blu-ray disc. You put the discs in, and then there's just blackness for an inordinate length of time. You think the disc isn't working, but it is. Then an empty red battery appears on the screen. You follow its progress from not filled in at all to partially filled in, finally to completely filled in. Then more blackness. Then finally a Clorox commercial. More blackness. The MENU doesn't appear until who knows how long. And if you watch an episode and then stop and leave, when you come back, it will not take you to where you left off. Instead, you have to sit through the seemingly endless screen blackness all over again, then the battery slowly filling, then the commercial, etc. etc. I have one of the newest and highest rated blu-ray players out there. And I have not had this problem with any other blu-ray. This is by far the most poorly made blu-ray disc ever."
1,madmen,This blu ray dvd arrived with a security tape which made it impossible to open. I contacted amazon which directed me to some instructions which needed several tools and 20 fingers...still it was impossible to open. Finally my husband managed to get it open by destroying the case. Sadly I will NEVER by another dvd from amazon since I can't get the case open.
5,Mad Men made magical,I chose Mad Men because I love the show but with the Blu Ray the 50's & 60's come alive like never before. It is beautiful to watch and to be able to observe fashion of that world on a scale that you just cant get through any other type of DVD. Blu Ray is the only way to watch Mad Men.
4,"""Mad"" about it!","There really is not much to say, except I am very pleased with my purchase. It arrived as expected without any problems or delays. If you are a Mad Men fan, you understand that it is exactly what it is-great TV."
3,Great actors in a dreary show,The first season was okay but not spectacular. Hoped season 2 would be better but doesn't happen. Unfortunately the show has very good actors and actresses but the script is sort of hum drum.
1,Blu-Ray Disc Doesn't Resume Where You Left Off,"A word of caution: this has nothing to do with Mad Men or the quality of the show (which is excellent), but the playing of the blu-ray disc is awful. The second season I purchased on blu-ray disc doesn't have a resume feature, allowing you to go back to the place you were at before you stopped and/or shut down. This makes it really inconvenient because you have to sit through the ads, the introductions, the Clorox commercial, the legal disclaimers, etc. before you get back to the episode at which you left off -- and then you have to fast-forward to find exactly where you were in the episode, if you can remember where that is! What a royal pain. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Give me a good, old-fashioned dvd that has the features I want!"
5,Best series on TV,"A+++++ series. Sophisticated, captivating and high TV standards. I can't wait for the next season."
5,Wish there were more stars.,"What can I say? I'm a maddict. Despite facing a looming deadline from my editor, I sat and watched the entire second season in 4 days -- one disc per day. I started watching the series during the middle of season two and so did not want to watch things out of order and waited breathlessly for season 2 to come out on DVD. It's the best television since the glory days of MASH, the Odd Couple, Bob Newhart, etc. etc. Love, love, love Mad Men."
5,"Oh, you dog, Don Draper!","It's ""Mad Men""! What's not to like?! I intended to collect each season of this wonderfully done series. Bless you, Matthew Weiner!"
4,Not as good as season 1,I liked this season but the first was a lot better-- this one had a few odd episodes which I'm hoping will be better explained in season 3-- I heard season 3 is better so I'm sticking with the show. And how can you not love hotty John Hamm?
5,Mad about Mad Men,My wife and are old enough to remember the Mad Men era - it's like watching a documentary. Thank goodness for feminism. My wife was so absorbed that she couldn't stop watching until the last episode had finished and then she still wanted more!
5,Great second season,"If you liked Mad Men in its first seson, you will love the second season. We continue to see the life of these Madison Avenue men who live their hard boozing and womanizing lives while defining new territories in advertising. We also obersve the effects on their entourage, wives, secretaries etc. The series continues to concentrate on Don Darper who continues his time as a creative genius at Sterling Cooper all while suffering the effects of success: high blood pressure, excessive drinking. Overall the writing has improved and the season is somewhat less bleak than at the beginning. It provides perfectly a sense of the era it represents: the 60's. All the characters are strongly played, especially the women who are not just side characetrs as they sometimes are in such series. This is clearly the best series around at the moment so do not hesitate: it is indispensable."
3,Not a fan of the show,Even though the characters and story lines were pretty solid I couldn't get into the show. I found it hard to watch but I know others who love it. The show seemed dull and honestly wasn't for me.
5,Wonderful Show,"If you love Mad Men and the characters, you love every season....enough said! This one is just a wonderfully juicy as all the rest of the series!"
3,Not what I was expecting,"This is by far my favorite band, I feel like I know them, their personality, through hours of listening to them while crossing the long Texas highways late at night. I've been watching them live since the late nineties when 60 or 70 of us would be packed into the dance floor of the Jolly Fox in Huntsville for a one-night show and the band would be as close to me as someone who I would be having a conversation with, due to the intimate space we occupied. I do not care for this album, there are much better examples of what they have to offer, see the Purple Album, Soul Gravy, and Cross Canadian Ragweed (self titled) but don't start here. I found the sound to be underdeveloped and the energy to be muted compared to the true output of this band. Their live shows are intoxicating, you would be better off spending your money on experiencing this band once than buying any of the albums they have ever made."
4,Cross Canadian Ragweed,"If you like Cross Canadian Ragweed, buy this cd. It is a two disc set, with mostly previously recorded tracks, but also some new ones. We are really enjoying it!"
3,"Not up to par, for one of my favorite bands.","Great talent and great music, but I believe Mr. Canada was more than three sheets to the wind when this was recorded live."
5,Spectacular,"This cd is amazing, the movie even more. It haunts and intrigues me every time I listen to it. I highly reccomend it to you as well as the movie!!!"
3,"Movie is great, but soundtrack is hit and miss","I hate to say it, because as much as I love the opening track, which is indeed reminisent of the late great Astor Piazolla, the remainder of the soundtrack is a bit spotty. The Tosca Tango Orchestra is moving in the right direction but they're not quite there yet and it shows on this album. Granted, it is program music and is meant to accompany a film. But don't buy this album thinking it's all as good as the opening track, because that track is easily the best one on the album.Does anybody know what that strange percusion instrument is? It's a very distinctive sound but also overused and distracting at times. This is certainly a group to keep an eye on. They are all talented musicians. With a bit more consistancy in the compositions they have potential for greatness."
4,Haunting Avant-garde Score,"This score, performed by the current road orchestra for David Byrne and written by the one-time keyboardist for 8 1/2 Souvenirs, is a beautifully spare companion to Richard Linklater's animated musings. Using Austin artists seems like a natural choice since the film takes place on the streets of Linklater's former stomping ground. Mostly piano and strings, it oscillates between dark broodings and the hopping tango; often, the accordion gives it a decidedly French feel. A great disc to pick up since the movie is mostly music peppered with dialogue (or vice versa). As a result, the cues are long."
4,dreamy but refreshing,"I bought this because I loved the movie, both visually and philosophically. The soundtrack goes very well with the movie and is responsible for much of the surreal feel of it. But even listened to independently it's great.The recording is kind of raw, there is little processing, and it may even be considered careless, but that's part of its charm.The sound itself is pretty original (to me anyway). It's strings (one violin, one cello and one double bass, I think), piano and accordeon. The result is refreshing. That's probably the best word to describe this: refreshing, and of course, dreamy."
4,a new Piazzola,"Other reviewers have described this music well, but none so far as identified the source for this particular variety of tango-derived music as coming from the New Tangos of Astor Piazzola. When I went to the film I assumend that the group was playing Piazzola until I saw the credits. For those of us who wish Piazzola had not died as young as he did, it is excitng to find some Texas-based musicians carrying on his ideas, and especially exciting to see them being used in Linklater's brilliant film.I could wish they hadn't bothered to include the Chopin track, but otherwise I highly recommend the works on this disk."
5,Kate Schrock does it again,"Another great album from Kate Schrock. Schrock has a great singing voice and is a good piano player. She is joined by many great musicians on this recording. Kate pours her soul into every song and the result is a fine listening experience. People like Tori Amos and Sara McLaclan are great, but I think Schrock is even better. Give her a try if you haven't already and if you like her past albums then pick this one up to."
5,Very nice,Perfect addition to any Little Saints Fans ~ Must have for bath time ... soft and cuddley too .. must see to appreciate!
3,Its ok,"For the price, but I wouldn't buy this new, Its just..... I dont know the only feature is pretty much the letters but even so, my four year old really doesn't care much to play this game. Other than that its OK for the price."
4,"Great, but HEAVY","I don't usually bother writing reviews, but figured it might be helpful for people considering this product.As expected from Solano, this is a well-made, excellent hair dryer that produces great results (shine, softness, etc.). Solano products are especially known for their reliability and logevity, and I'm sure this dryer is no exception. It is especially nice that this model comes with two different sizes of nozzles, and a hair diffuser, which I've seen sold separately for about $20.Despite this, I returned the dryer as I found it to be too heavy for my taste. If you're used to relatively heavy hair dryers (which many of the ionic models seem to be), it should be fine. Otherwise, you might want to check out the T3 featherweight ionic or something similar -- not sure if other makes are as long-lived as Solanos, but comfort won out when I considered all the options."
1,It is NOT an exact match!,"Do your self a favor and buy a genuine MOEN cartridge. It is a few dollars more, but it will stop your leak. These DANCO remakes claim to be an exact match to the original, and that is a lie. They are not the same. An original MOEN cartridge will have a bump at the top and bottom of the large side gaskets. The knock offs by DANCO do not. The MOEN gasket also has the sealing bead all the way around the outer edge, and the DANCO knock off has the bead in an oval shape covering the center of the part. This will not properly surround the port in the valve body and it WILL leak."
1,Buy the genuine part - 2 of these have failed in 2 years,"I've had to replace two of these in the past two years (same faucet). They work for a while and then start leaking again. This time, buying the genuine Moen part and hopeful that it will last longer than one year."
4,"Brief history of ""wild weasels""","A good book that describes in some detail the development of wild weasels, associated gears and tactics. Traces development through veitnam to more current times. Good coverage of topics related to WW history and development and some Airforce / Navy politics. Good for the casual readers with no engineering background to follow and understand. For engineers or researchers this will provide a good general background and introduction into this field."
2,so so,"besides the first few songs, the rest were not as great, mainly an edit mixture of clips combined"
4,Pure Pop is the BEST,I love this CD it is absoultely the best i am 13 and these songs are very uplifting and great i reccomend this CD to Christian pop listeners!
4,The Challenge of Blackaby and Brandt,"I enjoyed this book because it was one of the three texts I was required to read for a course; however, it was the only one that presented a challenge to one's personal holiness.The book discussed ""the call"", counseling others, our spiritual walk when things are going good and when encountering inconvenience and much worse things in life.Brandt presents his views from the professional counselor, devoted layman's perspective while Blackaby gives his opinion from the viewpoint of the leader or preacher. Each intersperces their narrative with supporting scripture.I found the book one to assure your humbleness. Some find the book ""holier than thou"" so warning, if you have a problem with someone telling you many of your problems come from yourself due to SIN, don't read it or you will be upset!It is worth the read."
2,Be Like Henry,"I found little of this book to be relevant to pastoring. Many general statements about Christianity were made, some of which were encouraging and confronting, but little that was pastoral in nature.Brandt's words were more timely than Blackaby's as Blackaby generally read Brandt's stuff and followd it with, ""Yeah, exactly, nice job Mr. Brandt.""There is also a disturbing notion that Christian leaders should expect Moses and Jesus and Elijah type experiences in their ministry.Also gives the notion that if you become just like Brandt and Blackaby every single person you ever meet will be led to the Lord immediately."
5,"Replacement 37x62 Deck Belt 40"" Murray","I just received the belt. Today is Thursday, I ordered it Monday so very fast arrival. I put it on and mowed an acre with no problem. It appears to be sturdier than my other belt. I'll have to see how it holds up in time, but so far I'm very pleased. It was 1/2 the price of the one in town! And even with s/h it was still cheaper than anything I could have bought around here. Thanks so much."
3,Not bad,"it is so cute , but when I use it, the feeling of it is kind of tough, not very comfort , but still ok"
2,Poor Quality,"I was not satisfied with this product. This capo doesn't have enough strength to press down the thinnest gauge steel strings on any fret. I have a few different guitars and tried it out on most of them. I give this two stars instead of only one because I'm pretty sure it'll work on a nylon strung guitar/classical. Acoustic steel strings are too formidable for this dinky thing.You get what you pay for. If you seek a capo, please spend more money on one of a higher caliber. The cheaper ones are not worth the mute or buzz."
2,You can find better.,I agree with the other reviews that this capo is not strong enough. Kyser makes a good brand of capo.
1,Better paper-weight!,This capo seemed to be well-built for its price but has ended up in the garbage after only a few weeks. It's spring has extremely low tension and is probably designed for First Act children's guitars. I wouldn't even trust it to keep a bag of potato chips closed and fresh.
1,No,"Pros:-Is cheap-Holds picks (I have not tested this function and it probably does not work well.-Is cheapCons:-Does not actually hold down strings even on the lowest action nylon string guitar-Not at all ""ergonomic"" but actually hurts my hands-What looks like shiny metal is actually cheap plastic-First Act made itStay. Away."
1,Borrring! HELP!,If you like hard games don't get this game. If you like easy games don't get this. This game is so short it's not even funny. whatever you do DON'T GET THIS GAME!
4,Grest Old West Tale,Nice cinematography and good action. Wish more western semi-biographical movies were written and produced now. Worth the time watching and doesn't require seeing the original to follow.
3,okay western,"A little overdone re: Billy the Kid and it lost picture quality very early on. I don't know if it was my TV audio setting or what, but voices were too low and gunfire would knock your hat off."
5,Superb Collection of Cash's early music,"This in my opinion is a superb collection of 32 songs recorded by Johnny Cash for Sun Records. As the CD information states, ""All tracks on this CD are first generation copies of the original undubbed Sun masters digital transfer by the Ampels system to ensure the highest fidelity."" And I think, in this case, the advertising is equal to the quality of the music. To clarify: ""Big River"" is also included -- contrary to a previous review -- while ""I still miss someone"" was first recorded in 1958 for Columbia Records (not Sun)!"
3,short lasting charge for new battery,The battery works but the charge only last in the camera for few hours and its back to the charger.. But it still wasn't much.
5,"Great Product, Great Service",This was a great company to order from. The product I ordered was delivered promptly and I was able to track my package and was notified of any changes. The product was in good condition and was exactly what I needed. I hope to do business with this company in the future.
3,camera battery,was glad to find my hard to find product. but would have liked a longer time before the battery was outdated.
4,Genuine Kodak,"I've been very disappointed with some of the cheaper replacement batteries, but this one works fine. I find this to be the case with most of my electronic toys ... get the OEM batteries."
5,Great product!,"Great product, could not find locally but of course Amazon had it! Am very grateful! Made the holidays memorable! thanks"
4,needed replacement camera battery,I needed another battery for my kodak digital camera the product was like new but used works just like the battery i got with my camera. I would definetly purchase this product again. Its so nice to not have to buy batteries after batteries. This chargeable battery lasts longer than kodaks AA chargeable batteries.
2,Kodak Rechargeable battery,I bought 2. I've only tried that one but it doesn't seem to keep or get a full charge. I'll give it time before I try the other. I wish Kodak was still around because it seems ANY Battery I buy will not be a fresh/new one.
1,Not what advertised,"It ""looks"" like a genuine Kodak product however they are not. Packaging was the first clue, second was I bought two of these and BOTH do not work. What a waste of money!"
3,tarantula shoes,"""tarantula shoes"" is very funny book. It is about a boy moves into a new town wants to be cool whith the other kids sohe trys to convince his parents to buy the shoes for him but there is just one problem they are 150$ so they say no. So he starts making events whith his tarantula to gain money but the spider was lost one day and blamed his friend and to find out what happens in the rest of the book youll need to read it."
4,So many fond memories for this book.,"This was the first non-picture book I read as a child, in 3rd grade (I am now 24). It was the first book to capture my interest enough to sit and read, and compelling enough to leave specific scenes in my memory for all time."
4,"Sweet, Sexy, Spanish Rom-Com","A pitch-perfect comedy of errors. Extraterrestre is only a sci-fi movie in name. In reality, the sci-fi element just makes for a fun backdrop for all of the romantic shenanigans that take place. Julián Villagrán gives a touching and sultry lead performance -- perfectly balancing love-struck and devious, while looking very good doing it.I found myself watching the whole thing with a smile on my face -- it's an enjoyable, light-hearted film. It's worth noting that I am NOT normally a fan of rom-coms and I AM a fan of sci-fi movies -- so this had every opportunity to disappoint me, but did no such thing. It's a great date movie or a perfect pick-me-up for a gloomy day."
3,"TALENTED, BUT A BLUESMAN??","i actually went to high school with anthony in the Toronto area. He's a super talented musician no doubt. But knowing that as a teen , Anthony was absolutely mad for bands like Iron Maiden and George Lynch of Dokken. Never got the impression he was into blues at all. Not to bust the kid, But i consider him probably just a super talent as opposed to a real bluesman. Rock on Anth"
2,Well ...,"... it's not a bad CD if you like a kind of jazzy/funky blues. Gomes has a nice Strat. But if you exspect searing solos in terms of late Stevie Ray Vaughan - forget it. Nice music for moving your feet, sitting on a couch after a hard days work, but it does not lead yourself to stand up. Lyrics are moderate: ""Love"", ""Baby"", ""Pain"", Feeling"" - that's about it. Maybe the other CD's kick more [behind]."
3,Leather Pants,"Saw AG at a festival this summer. We were looking forward to his set, but we left early when we heard him. Listening to it again, I think this CD tells the same story. The energy may not be manufactured, the style may not be consciously constructed, the licks may not be by wrote, but... come on - leather pants. If Disneyland had a blues band, it would sound like this. You can always tell when someone learned to play a style from records instead of learning in a community."
3,Watch this movie for one reason,"The one reason? Fred Willard. Good Lord, this guy is hysterical in this flick. As a play-by-play man with virtually no clue at all, he completely steals the movie. I had heard critics praise his performance before I actually saw the movie myself, but I had no idea he would nail the part to such an extent. Overall, the movie is pretty amusing, and there are moments of laugh-out-loud hilarity, but the scattershot humor becomes constant the moment Mr. Willard appears. Worth a look (and a laugh) for this performance alone."
3,"CHARMING MOCKUMENTARY, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A PET","The brilliance of this fake documentary (about people who enter their dogs in the biggest dogshow of the year) lies not in racy slapstick or memorable one-liners, but in sophisticated and layered verbal wit.Not only are pet owners, competitions, and manners satirized, but also the format of the documentary itself. Despite their antics, you wind up sympathizing with them to some extent, with the exception of the yuppie couple and the announcer. With the exception of the announcer (who is crude and ludicrous by turns) you can believe that all of these kooky characters really exist, especially if you watch enough real documentaries.Neat piece of work overall, although some moments are more interesting than others. I'd give it a 3.5 rating if I could."
5,Best in Show,"This movie shows a great amount of restraint on how many ways they could have made fun of dog shows and the people involved in them. Actually, it was funnier the second time, because then you get all the little nuances you may have missed the first time around. This could be the sleeper of 2000. I found it to be really funny and if you have EVER seen even 15 minutes of a dog show, this movie is a MUST. I recommend it highly for any age group over the age of 13. It is really great entertainment."
3,Mediocre,This just isn't as good as Spinal Tap or Waiting for Guffman. Much of the film isn't funny and many of the jokes don't get any laughs.
5,"""Best"" In Show!!!!","This is one of my favorite movies! Guest did wonderfully directing, yet i think he was better as the small town bloodhound owner with the tackle shop. My favorite characters were the two women with the poodle, Rhapsody in White. I feel the acting in this film was wonderful and the actors carried the roles well. I felt they were suited for the job and were great at delivering the comedy. This movie is hilarious from start to finish, you'll love it!!"
2,Just Okay,"This movie I think could have been so much more. It just seemed to drag on and I chuckled a few times but nothing really struck me as really funny. As far as mockumentarys go, I recommend the far superior ""Drop Dead Gorgeous""."
2,Painful,"This movie truly mocks people who accept their dogs as another member of their dysfuntional families.Extremely corny (on purpose, I know, but over the top), a little erotic (but almost not in a sexual way), and completely bizarre... I really hated it. I know it was a mockumentary and I could see what it was supposed to be, but it missed the mark.The characters weren't funny at all- They made me confused, but not in a good way. I didn't laugh at their quirks and a lot of them made me uncomfortable. The entire movie was a mistake to watch."
4,The Best in Show,"This is a great funny movie. The actors are fantastic, and it's get better with the other in the series!"
5,Dry humor=comedic gold,"I love this movie! It is dry humor and I admit it is not for everyone but if you like the office, wes anderson, 30 rock, this movie is definitely something you should try."
2,I've seen it all before,"I almost died laughing with ""This is Spinal Tap"", and had a really good time with ""Waiting for Guffman"". But too much of a good thing can go awry, and the 'mockumentary' style is old news for me. Granted, the movie has some funny moments, but after a while the interviews got to be too predictable. The actors are fantastic, especially Parker Posey as a hysterical and rude dog owner, but their great acting is not enough to carry the movie forward. My favorite part is the duo of show commentators. The American is being all crass and makes bad jokes, while the English tries to endure the aggravation as politely as possible. Other than that, i found it hard to crack a smile here and there."
3,No best in show!!,I watched this movie on the recommendation of a co worker. I am glad it was included in my Prime or I would have been disappointed that I had paid money to see it. I didn't find it to be very funny .I watched to the end just to see which dog won.
1,Skip it,"Off humor, not really that funny. The movie is very slow in spots. I would skip this one as it is not worth your time."
3,Better the first time,This is a sometimes witty mockumentary that was better the first time I watched it. Don't plan on watching it again.
2,Not that funny,"This is one of those movies either you think its funny or you don't. I myself did not find it funny at all, a few chuckles here and there."
3,Best in Show DVD,"Very funny movie, a tad slow in the beginning but it had many hilarious moments....great cast of well known actors."
3,Dog Shows,"This was a moderately funny takeoff on the dog show people and their dogs. The people and dogs were all depicted as abberant personalities of various types. Straight and otherwise, the dogs also were quirky."
4,It's funny because it's true!,"OK, Political correctness aside, this movie hits the mark on a lot of levels. People who are too obsessive with their pets (come on we all know at least one or two of them) are the targets here, not the animals themselves. The owners portrayed in ""Best of Show"" rank up there with Trekkies, horse owners, comic book guys and other ""cults"" of people, whose lives are lived vicariously through animals or other forms of escape from reality. Guest and the surrounding cast do an excellent job on the character portrayals."
4,Funny stuff,"This movie is very funny espically considering it is mostly adlib. If you like ""The Office"" you should like this."
4,Funny and all too true,"If you've read Vickie Hearne's book ""Adam's Task,"" about training and communicating with animals, you'll know that the types of dog-owners in this movie are all too real, especially the neurotic yuppies who make their poor Weimarauner crazy and almost start World War III over a lost squeaky-toy. The idiotic dog-show announcer is a sort of stand-in for the rest of us, since he asks all the stupid questions about dogs that we might think of, but would have too much sense to actually say out loud. Like all good satires, ""Best in Show"" makes you think as well as laugh, but do enjoy the laughs."
1,Not funny or worth the money,"Christopher Guest's films must be an acquired taste. I found this attempt at satire crude and heavy-handed: the purpose seemed to be to exploit every pathetic stereotype and hackneyed joke he could think of, while saying nothing in particular about the sport he was supposedly sending up. Everything about the film suggests it was a real quickie -- even the setting for the ""big show,"" which resembled a rented junior high gym. The only truly funny character is the ""color commentator,"" whose accent and inappropriate remarks perfectly catch the on-screen persona of a certain retired athlete who for years was a staple of the annual Westminster broadcasts."
1,Paws Down,"I had been waiting for this movie! I was keenly disappointed. I watched it a good 20 minutes, hoping to see the ""gut-splitting"" humor promised and turned it off. Glad I only paid rental for it, rather than buying it. Others apparently found it funny, though, so I suggest you see it somewhere before buying it, and decide for yourself. :)Perhaps I expected more dog action, and found mostly dysfunctional people dialog."
1,Best in Show Better than Sleeping Pills,"If you like to watch DIRT GROW, then this is the movie for you ! Watched only half of the movie because we didn't want to waste the electricity and our time. Sorry we spent the money on this purchase.If you're still interested in seeing it, wait until the local library offers it ('cause then it would be free)."
1,Awful,Save your money. Unless you're a dog freak there's nothing here but the opportunity to see some usually-funny actors embarrass themselves by attempting improvised humour. Funny actors aren't necessarily funny people as this film repeatedly proves.
1,Hiliarious with stupid humor,"Christopher Guest did a wonderful job with this movie. The characters are very well developed and very funny. This movie has a star packed cast including Parker Posey, Catherine O'Hara, Eugene Levy. The fact that this was filmed in a documentary setting makes this movie a funny form of the Blair Witch craze."
1,painful,"Dog shows have got to be funny, right? I mean, endless fodder, yes? Not if they're ""Best in Show"". I was ready to laugh - all of my friends seem to love this movie - but all I could think when watching it was ""please kill me"". Terrible acting from people who try waaay too hard to convey how quirky they must be. You can't force humor, people. I will avoid every movie that is ever compared favorably to this one. May I never have to see another movie as bad as this in my life, unless I'm being punished for something."
3,This movie is weird,"My mom has a friend who does dog shows, and so we've been to a few. So when my mom saw it at Hollywood video, she decided to rent it. My parents and my sisters watched it while I was babysitting, and when I came home it had just ended and they were all in tears from laughing so hard. My mom said it was so cheesy, that I had to watch it, and they all sat through it again except my 15 year old sister who said it ""corrupted me too much the first time"" (My other sisters said they watched the second time just to watch my reactions) I found parts of it so stupid they were funny, and yes some of the jokes are good, but mostly the movie is pushing the borderline between spoof/too silly and just plain dumb."
5,Hilarious concept!,"In a world filled with trite movies of teenaged angst, this movie is refreshing and amusing.The movie follows several petowners as they prepare for a major dog show. However, these are not just your average dogowners. Their complete obsession with winning the coveted ""Best in Show"" prize motivates their hilarious antics.The dogs in the movie have more common sense than their owners."
4,more humor than hatred,"""Satire"" is kind of a strong word for what this movie is. It does poke a good deal of fun at the ""dog breeding world,"" or whatever you might call it. To truly appreciate the movie, I think you need to see the ""real thing"" -- the annual Eukanuba Tournament of Champions. Joe Garagiola is the ""color commentator"" for the real show, and he tries his damndest to say silly, ignorant things -- much like the commentator in the movie."
4,"Great Movie, Decent DVD","This movie is hilarious. Drop-dead hilarious. I'm not a big fan of improvisional comedy, but I must admit that, when it's done right, it's beyond funny. It's fun to try and guess which parts were made up on the spot, but moreso, it's just fun to sit back and laugh.The DVD itself doesn't contain a whole lot in terms of extra features. I'm not buzzing about it. The movie is well worth owning, though."
2,Well . . .,"Meh, it was ok. I thought parts were funny, but the dry humor got tiresome after a while. I won't watch it again. (and Jane Lynch is WAY overrated)"
3,Just OK,"The movie was OK, not nearly as funny as I had heard it was. There were a lot of situations that were set up but never went anywhere. I've gone to dog shows, so I thought some of the material was on the mark. Fred Willard had the funniest role in the movie. I would say this movie is worth watching once."
2,Huh???,I guess I just don't get it. I didn't find this movie that great. The best part is Eugene Levy's two left feet. It might be a decent rental but don't forget to return it because it is not worth the late fees!
2,Better not shown,"I imagine this movie might be funny if you're really into dog shows. I'm not, so I couldn't tell you. Mediocre at best. ""This is Spinal Tap"" was better."
1,Complete boredom.,This movie is for people who find Dane Cook and Ricky Gervais funny. I lasted about 20 minutes before sparing myself of this torture.
1,Not even an average comedy,"I watched this expecting a great laugh riot and didn't even get an occasional chuckle. The beginning has the hand-held camera feel a la Blair Witch, though the camera seems to become steady about a half-hour into the film. I'd heard that very little of this was actually scripted and it seems evident when watching as the actors seem to be grabbing for words or ideas out of thin air - it was a lot like watching an improv class. The doggies were cute, but in general there was a lot of low-brow humor - a lot of references to previous ..exploits of one of the owners and some very awkward conversation about the psychological effects of a dog seeing it's Mommy and Daddy practicing the Kama Sutra.Anyway, not something I would ever want to see again, but I did manage to stay awake."
1,"Good commercials, bad movie","If you go to a video store, best in show is the worst (Movie) on shelf. I had high hopes for it.There were okay parts, but it was a huge dissapointment."
3,"Considering the subject, the satire should have been better","This was an entertaining enough film, but considering the thoroughly bizarre nature of the dog show subculture and how it is a huge bullseye for any satirist, I was disappointed to find as many hits as misses in this mockumentary.I enjoyed watching it, but by the end I found myself thinking of all of the wasted potential. The real dog shows are simply insane beyond the comprehension of normal people. The various breeds of dogs border sometimes on the freakish, and their handlers often are close behind. This is all just so ripe for the picking, yet this movie too often falls back on familiar and sometimes tired cliches. For me, it kept the movie from being hilarious instead of simply amusing. Too bad."
3,Almost but not quite,"The idea was original and a good one, hoever the movie as a whole was poorly put together. It was obvious to just how little, about the dog world, the writers and producers knew (especially comming from an exhibitor's point of view). They missed too many really good oppertunities for rib cracking humor. The budget for this film had to have been very small. While I know the need for effects were nil, it would seem that they could have at least gotten a better camera crew rather then going for the hand held, law and order or ""cops"" look. I think if this movie had had a little bit more time, and a little bit more research and attention to detail, it could have been really good and absolutely histarical. I can't give it above a three, and I am being kind in doing that. There were some really funny parts in the movie, and characters, but as a whole it was pretty weak. Nice try...hope some one will do another one, only do it better!"
3,Dog Movie,"This movie is not at all what I thought..I thought it would be one of those boring dog show movies ..and it wasn't..It's about the strange people who enter the dog show..who are willing to put everything on the line to make sure their dog is in it, to win it...Their are 5 dogs and their trainers which are focussed on, and the things that happen to them are just to hilarious...U got to see this movie.."
3,"Funny, but lacking.","This is the type of movie that you watch once, snickering every couple of minutes, but don't bother watching again."
2,"""Best In Show"" Maybe not Quite the Best In Show","While I find nothing wrong with Christopher Guest's mocumentary films, and most times even find them incredibly funny, ""Best in Show"" missed its mark. Guest continously puts his characters in awkwardly funny situations that should make the audience chuckle and laugh, but I just don't see it. The film took itself seriously, which is what most audiences loved, but I just couldn't get into it. The characters are well-rounded and developed, the cinematography is great, but the plot just doesn't go anywhere. The film follows a group of dog show contestants on the road to, and during, a national dog show competition, and that's it. There's no twists. There's no punch lines. There's no relief factor. Just ninety minutes of owners and their dogs. I could have easily gotten the same thing on Animal Planet."
4,A fun time was had by all,"I really enjoyed seeing ""Best in Show."" I have to admit that it's not my favorite of Christopher Guest's films; ""Waiting for Guffman"" is his best. Still, it's a warm and funny look into the world of dog shows, with a little quirky charm thrown in. Of all his movies, I think this one appeals to the broadest audience."
5,Much needed after watching the real thing,"I have to say, this is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Asside from ""Waiting for Guffman"", which was also directed by Christopher Guest, there are no better satire movies than this. Based on dog shows, this documentary follows several individuals and couples as they prepare to go to the big show. There is an apparent script, but much of it is ad-libbed, and the actors do such a good job of it. Every scene is filled with laughs. And if watching the entire movie isnt enough, there are about 30 deleted scenes that are just as funny, but that might not've fit the feeling of the film as a whole. If you're a dog, or a friend of a dog, or you just like comedies, get this movie!"
1,I didn't like it.,"I feel i have a dry sense of humor. This one just didn't do it for me, but it did have a few moments."
5,HILARIOUS,"I absolutely love this movie. Watch it all the time with friends! Has held up over time, good quality. Great mockumentary."
5,Lololol,"Always a great laugh. Bought it as a gift for someone else, but still recieved with many laughs.Many Thanks"
4,"Funny, weird, quirky and inimitable",This movie comes from out of left field. It is so different and original. It is just a fun and humorous movie. If you like dogs this movie is truly a must. If you frequently find yourself staring at dog owners and wondering what is wrong with them then you absolutely have to watch this movie. It's a good movie.
5,One of my favorite movies of all time.,The meltdown over the Busy Bee is classic. I can't get enough of Harlan Pepper naming nuts.I can watch this movie repeatedly as with most Guest movies. Love this cast.
3,funny be not feel good enough,"This is the type of movie you have to be in the mood for , the character acting was SUPERB, the acting delicious, and the timing was very saturday night live -ish. Would have been better 40 minutes shorter. Not a keeper."
5,Silly silly human race,"If you can laugh at the absolute absurdness of human behavior,dont look any further than Christopher Guest and company. Not only here,but ANY of the classics Guest has created (WITH THE UNFORTUNATE EXCEPTION OF THE HORRID""FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION"". Christopher missed the mark big time with that one.)Anywho...Best in Show,Mighty Wind,Spinal Tap...!!!! Start the DELICIOUS insanity!!!"
5,Very Funny!,"Best in Show is a wonderful ""mockumentary"" with all the melodramatic wit you would expect from such great improvisational actors. The entire movie had a great ""un-movie"" feel, as if the characters were really filmed in their homes. The charicatures of yuppies, etc. were hilarious! The commentator did get on my nerves, but that was probably intentional. Be sure to watch all the deleted scenes when you're having trouble getting to sleep."
1,This movie is a real dog.,This was one of the few movies that I watched for less than 20 minutes. I don't understand why it was recommended to me.
1,Not recommended,"I do not recommend this movie to anyone. I found it boring, and overall not good. There were some semi-funny parts, but not many."
1,Best of show,"Sadly we were very excited initially to receive the DVD, then found we couldn't play it on our player"
1,BEST IN SHOW,"BEST OF SHOW IS A MOVIE THAT ISN'T WORTH THE PRICE OF ADMISSION OR THE RENTAL FEE. THE MOVIE TRAILER WAS BETTER THAN THE MOVIE. THE MOVIE TRYS TO BE FUNNY, BUT COMES OUT REALLY STUPID. THE INTERVIEWS WITH THE DOG SHOW OWNERS & HANDLERS WAS JUST PLAIN BORING. KEN"
1,Needs more on dogs and less on documentary and sex humor,"""Best in Show"" was a big disappointment. I was expecting a funny dog show movie, but got a corny, stereotyped movie that stressed sex humor over substance. Where are the good old movies that relied on subtlety and good acting? I think the movie had a lot of potential but missed its mark."
1,We all hated this film,"I bought this DVD because a friend said it was one of the funniest films he had ever seen. We're still friends, but I'll never listen to one of his reviews again--our taste must not be compatible.My wife, daughter, and I seldom agree on anything but we unanimously consider this the worst movie we've ever seen. It's the only movie I've ever turned off before the end.On the plus side, watching most of this film has given me a new perspective on cinema. I used to think I knew bad movies. Now I know that most movies are at least pretty good, and it's only a very few that are truly bad. This is one of those very few bad films.Best in Show belongs to a genre of ""comedies"" that I find boring at best, but often cruel and mean. Other films of this type are ""Waiting for Guffman"", ""Bottle Rocket"", etc. If you enjoy watching pathetic people struggle then perhaps you'll appreciate this movie."
4,Best in Trilogy,"When I reviewed WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, I mentioned that I had BEST IN SHOW and THIS IS SPINAL TAP on order. And if we want to consider them some sort of trilogy, since they're ""mockumentaries"" with quite a bit of overlap in their casts... Now that I've seen them all, well, note the title of this review.Humor is subjective, and it's true that movie one goes ""over the top"" quite a bit more than WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, as another reviewer noted, it's still my favorite of the three. With GUFFMAN in a close second, I'll add. Maybe I'm just partial to Hubert the bloodhound, or North Carolina."
3,Dog-gone funny,"Very funny movie from Christopher Guest (of Spinal Tap fame) and Eugene Levy. A mockumentary that follows various dog-owners and their dogs to a Westminster-like dog show. The couple played by Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock were very funny. Living by catalogs. Not much in the way of DVD extras. The commentary with Guest and Levy is pretty good. I highly recommend this movie, but would not own it myself. Therefore it gets 3 stars. A very solid rental."
5,Best In Show,This is the best movie ever. I have watched it over and over and over again and never get sick of it. It is so hilarious that you have to buy it because you will want to see it again and again.
5,It's Funny!,"If you like animals, especially dogs....you'll love this movie! It's Funny...Hilarious at some points and quite entertaining.Even if you're not too crazy about animals you'll probably like it."
4,Hysterically accurate!,"After seeing ""Best in Show"" I actually went to a huge dog show in NYC - the characters portrayed in the movie were so accurate it was hysterical! Being a ""dog person"" I really enjoyed this film!"
2,could have been alot better,"The funniest pairing was that of the hot young woman with the wrinkly old man. Now THAT had some mileage, but unfortunately, the story departed and you barely even saw the old man again. Classic bait and switch. Overall, kind of an odd movie. Was barely entertaining enough to watch the whole thing through, and if I had it to do over again, probably wouldn't."
5,Best in Show - A True Blue Ribbon Movie,"This is one of the greatest comedy movies, ever made. Christopher Guest has done it again! I could not stop laughing when I first watched this movie, and after buying it on DVD and watching it 6 more times... it seems to just get funnier, and funnier. If anyone wrote a bad review about this movie, they have to be complete idiots, and enjoy unorginal Jim Carrey humor. Some of the one star reviews on here, almost made me want to puke. What does an 11 year old boy know about REAL humor? He is still laughing at re-runs of Rugrats. Take it from me. This movie is funny as hell, and should be included in any true Comedy DVD collection."
5,Best In Mockumentary's,"If you saw Spinal Tap you know what Christopher Guest is capable of as far as so true, yet so ""out there"" pseudo Documentary. Best In Show is of the same calibre, the addition of Eugene Levy, and a great supporting cast of seasoned actors and actresses makes this only the more enjoyable movie, we enjoyed this movie and received the best ""belly laughs"" in a long while. So grab your popcorn and grab your favorite canine and watch and enjoy this work of comedic genius!."
3,It's Okay...and Different.,"Christopher Guest likes to present the bizzare in the ""ususal"" envirnment. For me, the best part of this DVD was the commentary. Listening to Christopher and Eugene Levy talk about what went into this film was very funny. Funnier than the movie!The deleted scenes were also enjoyable. This movie falls a little short of SPINAL TAP. A much better C. Guest film. But for the small screen it works oaky."
4,Does your dog need a therapist?,This movie is a spoof on the world of dog shows. The opening scene with a show dog and the owners at a therapist's office is hysterical and sets the tone for the rest of the movie. I must see!
5,Brilliant,"Did anyone else find this tough to track down in a cinema. I did ( It's amazing how cinemas give distinctly average films repeated showings, and squeeze a gem like this on at about 11:00pm on a monday night)Anyway this is brilliant stuff. It's natural to be wary of a premise like this. A film about a dog show, eh, hmm. It would usually be a variety of ""ahhhh cute ikkle doggies"" performing a variety of human emotions. Of course with the inevitable love story ( both human and canine). But is it? Hell no it's a subtle poke at some overly doting dog lovers, with great casting and a hilarious script. This film falls into the ever rarer category of actually being better than your expectations. I kid you not, at the cinema I was at people were crying with laughter and rolling about in the aisles. One man was pretty much laughing from start to finish. He must of missed every second joke trying to recover from then one before. This is something special."
4,Hilarious Comedy,"If you like A Mighty Wind you will probably like this. It is the same group that did Spinal Tap, Princess Bride, A Mighty Wind, and Waiting for Guffman. This one is a ""behind the scenes"" look at dog shows and once you have seen a dog show this gets even funnier. Plus there are some beautiful dogs too . . ."
3,Its not the dogs....,"I'm a dog owner myself, not that I show my dogs. I couldn't they're Mutts. However, I do enjoy watching the occasional Dog Show. I was a little skeptical about this movie, because I just didn't think the material lent itself to a feature film.The movie chronicles four different groups of dog owners and their adventures and misadventures on the way to the Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia. The story continues with the actual competition. The commentators for the show are actually the best part of the movie.Given this, I would say that this is a pretty good movie. Its not hysterical by any means, but it is enjoyable. The movie is slow going for the first 30 minutes or so, but by the time the actual Dog Show starts, it has developed into a funny tale in which you realize its not the dog's fault, it's just that humans are insane to put this much crazy effort into showing a dog. With this movie, as with any dog show, don't get your expectations too high, and you should enjoy it."
3,Not as good as other Guest films.,"Love Best in Show, etc... This was a bit of a let down. It had it's moments but overall just not as entertaining."
3,more of a joke than a storyline,"there really is not a story line it's built in a documentary style it flips back and forth constantly with very dry low brow humor.i wasnt expecting to see them over exaggerate and mock people at dog shows...more of an insult than a comedy.the dogs really dont even have a place in it and that is the feel i get from it, where are the dogs? where is the funny?it was ok i did find some of it enjoyable but i was annoyed by the constant frame switching and moments where the actors seem to be bored by their own lines."
5,Sophia Loren Persian Eye,"A hysterically funny and warm movie with sharp wit. The actors beautifully capture the idiosyncracies of the dog world. My favorite is Sherri Ann as the trophy wife and listener of her ""inner instinct"". Best in show definetly is worthwile for those who enjoy smart humor with a twist. It's very dramatic and very show-like."
4,Comic Acting Showcase,"The freedom given the actors in this project pays great dividends. This is NOT your typical Hollywood sight-gag, slapstick, bathroom humor comedy. It is smart, subtle, and completely convincing. While some of the ideas are predictable, many are brilliant and it is obvious the actors are having a great time. I would not recommend this movie for everyone. If you can't get enough of Jim Carrey, leave this one alone."
5,Funniest film in years,"If you have a dry sense of humor and you hate the idiotic simple slapstick comedy going around these days, Best In Show is a gem! I loved the film, I laughed so many dang times(that means it was funny.) This is in my opinion the funniest film ever made! I despise ""dumb"" films with little or no brains involved i.e.e every comedy out there...Best In Show is fresh in its mockery of the dog show and of human beings and obsession. Waiting for Guffman is not even close to this funny film. Guffman was not that funny at all compared to Show. Buy it now if you have a dry humor!I have an early stage DVD...it has good quality, there is not much extra feature on it, but after all the film is what counts and the film is great so 5/5 baby!"
1,Two paws down,"My husband and I were waiting for this movie to come out in DVD, so the day it did we ran and bought it. BIG MISTAKE! I was expecting a comedy about dog shows, what I got was a mock documentary about the people who show the dogs. Watched it through to the end kept hoping there would be something good I could say about this movie, WELL, I CAN'T!"
4,Dog Blue - a Bedtime Favorite,"This is a sweet, simple book about a boy who wants (and gets!) a dog. It's perfect for the little boy or girl who loves dogs. I thought the high points of the story are that the boy makes the best of what he has and is grateful even though his dog isn't blue colored, and also that he takes good care of his dog. Good lessons for young kids."
2,"Bertie needs counseling, not a dog","A young boy named Bertie has an unhealthy fixation on the color BLUE. He soon extends this obsession to a pet. We witness imaginative play where Bertie hallucinates that he is petting, feeding, and walking his blue dog, even dragging the leash and collar along the ground. But since ""pretend dogs don't fetch sticks,"" Bertie must take his psychosis to the next level: now he *is* a blue dog. He barks like a dog, eats sticks, even scratches himself!Act II reveals Bertie to be the lucky recipient of a real dog. Yet he almost sinks into depression--sobbing into his hands and subsequently curling up into the fetal position--when it turns out to be a beautiful, spotted, black and white (but not BLUE) dog.Thankfully, a sudden inspiration allows the dog to be BLUE in name if nothing else, and everyone lived happily ever after. Too little, too late."
4,"Trick or Treat, anyone?","I read this book when I was in elementary school and liked it a lot. I recently gave my copy to one of my younger cousins. The girls in a gymnastics class want to have a Halloween party. Jodi is interested in planning the party, but Becky (who is kind of a brat) points out that Jodi is always disorganized and says that she'll never be able to pull it off. Jodi is determined to make the party a success to prove Becky wrong. When something unexpected happens at the party, Jodi finds a way to prove to both herself and the other gymnasts that she can be cool-headed and can handle herself and the situation."
3,not a toe-tapper!,"no, there's no music on this cd. but the guy's a poet, not a singer! i prefer this to most of the band stuff. then again, i'm a big fan. have been for nearly 20 years. ""just visiting"" and ""loss of am. innocence"" are my faves. for completists or carroll uber-fans? noooo! that distinction goes to ""pools of mercury"".that's how i feel, anyway."
5,My review,"I for one really like this cd , I listen to it all the time . I never got to go to a reading of his and I really wish I could've but maybe it's because it's a live cd I feel like I'm at one everytime I listen to this cd . No I'm not crazy , that's just the best I can describe the feeling this cd gives me . I also really liked the poetry that was read on the cd and like the others said there isn't any music on this cd but that's not the kind of cd this is anyway . I think a lot of the things he reads on this cd are really beautiful in their own way and not to mention there is some comedy in it when he reads things like the monologue The Loss of American Innocence . As you can tell over all I really enjoy this cd . RIP Jim you will be messed !"
4,scratcher,"Good value for the money. Rollerballs not very effective, but scratcher works. Hasn't been destroyed by the kids yet!"
5,ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!,"I have looked for these for years. They are made so cheap from other places, but these are wonderful. Mine is sitting right next to me at this moment. Nice 18inch handle, with a nice curl at end. Like someone scratching your back. Love it, love it, love it."
1,UNRELIABLE,I never received this item -- nor could I get a response from the company when I asked about it. My opinion -- RIP OFF!
1,"Look, don't touch!","Beautiful fabric, but snags easily! When a thread is pulled, it goes through the design and cannot be repaired. Mine actually came with snags and was returned!"
2,don't bother with this hunk,"short and sweat review: Nice display when working. The big problem is that there is a bug in the geometry settings. Not only do you have to play with all the setting when switching resolutions, this monitor will reset it's geometry settings on a whim. You never know if your going to boot up to an oval display or not. Proview must of thought we enjoy fooling with their neat on screen controls so much that they gave us a reason to go in to them. Arrrggghhh"
1,busted,"One year warranty. 1.5 years later, boom! Monitor goes dead as door knob. I originally paid $387.17 for this monitor new in 2005. I'm glad monitor prices have gone down, but this a big disappointment. I have old old monitors that have lasted me 10 years plus! I expected much more on life of product."
2,Superficial,"N. Harrison pretty much nails it - this is just a coffee table book. Blowups of individual video stills are nice looking, but don't convey much of anything about the works. The blurbs are largely superficial. Rush's earlier book ""New Media in Contemporary Art"" is a much better survey of the terrain. Harrison's point about Harun Farocki also illustrates a wider point - the conceptual rubric of ""video art"" is incoherent and unnecessary. It was a stop-gap introduced in the 60s when this stuff was brand new, but unnecessary and no longer useful today. These are simply Artists. Full stop. They often work in installation, sometimes in film, video, photography, computational playback mechanisms (Stan Douglas)... the term ""Video Art"" is now simply marketing jargon."
4,pretty interesting,"This movie waz pretty cool,it kept me interested throughout the whole movie.It waz definitly worth wat I paid for it."
1,"Total failure, a disgrace!","You put De Niro, Norton and Mila together as bait for the unfortunate viewer/customer who will watch this unexcusable failure of a movie, it is so bad it borders on unbeliavable.People will say this is a ""indie"" movie, it has a independent feel to it (maybe it is indeed an indepedent production, I don't know). But htis is no excuse for the simple fact that this movies is atrociously bad. The cast is there just to make you forget how bad it is. But guess what? They don't manage to do it. All the time you keep checking your clock wanting it to end, knowing you won't get back the precious minutes you've wasetd of your life."
2,Not what I expected,I thought this would be a really cool movie. But it was kind of slow and just not what I thought it would be. Amazon was great. Our movies got here even before I expected them.
4,Ralph's Review,"Took several hours to download, and I could not do an instant viewing until download was complete. However, when I was able to view, movie visual and audio quality was excellent, as with all other media purchased through Amazon. Thank you Amazon for providing great media products."
4,"According to mom-in-law, its a good movie.","I gave this move as a gift to ol mom in law. She is in her late 70s. She said she was pleased with the film and would recommend it to others who like this genre. I plan on borrowing it from her in the future, and will update with my take."
3,Unusual,"The structure of the film is unusual, which may please you or may not. It's something of a puzzle to put the storyline together which, again, may or may not be a good thing. I lost interest about 1/3 of the way through."
3,High Hopes for a Dismal Film,"I had incredibly high hopes for a movie featuring Robert DeNiro and Edward Norton. Boy was I let down. Edward Norton's character has a horrible ""gangster"" accent that doesn't translate into the real-life nitty gritty it's supposed to portray. As the film goes on, he loses more and more of it but the first 10 minutes of hearing him speak I was cringing the whole time. DeNiro was DeNiro, but even he couldn't hold together a no-lot borefest that left more answers than resolutions. It was intended to have more of an impact on the audience, but even with all of the religious questions and dramatic ""epiphanies"" it fell incredibly short of its mark. I honestly thought that DeNiro was going to kill himself in the end, and I honestly think it would've been a better ending."
2,Mostly Forgettable,"Stone is confusing. Not in a hard to follow like Inception kind of way, but why does this movie even exist kind of way. On the surface you would think it would make some big or profound statement about our prison system with Robert DeNiro playing a correctional officer overseeing to his final case involving the parole of Edward Norton who was in there for arson that killed his grandparents. Things get complicated when Milla Jovovich shows up as Norton's wife.None of the three characters are at all likeable as they intertwine, making no rooting interest in what happens next. By the time the movie starts to pick up near the end, there is a twist that just left me asking the screen, ""why even bother?"" Stone just completely goes nowhere. It tries to be some sort psychological thriller but forgot to include any actual thrills in the movie. If there was some deep subtext or meaning to Stone, it completely went over my head."
2,Strange editing feels like parts are missing.Or maybe just disjointed,"This movie is never sure what it wants to be, jailhouse romp? Affair between old man and younger slutty woman? Thriller? It never really fits any of these and never completes it's promise. It's starts out interestingly enough, De Niro and Nortan have an interesting dynamic as prospective parolee and his officer (De Niro). Then it kind of convults as Norton tries to set up De Niro with Norton's Wife (Milla Jovovich). At this point it gets very hazy as De Niro and Jovovich descend into an affair with strange co dependancy. While DeNiro's Wife sits at home wringing her hands. It just kind of drones along without much resolution, then tries to tie it all together with vague references to Norton's troubled past as a youth. Really just kind of a mess and convoluted."
1,less than dull,"I was looking forward to seeing Norton and Deniro team up again (the score). Unfortunatly this movie fell way short, thank god for katz and free downloads."
3,Movie review - Stone,"I have to agree with some of the negative reviews. The actors were wonderful, the story was not. I am a huge DeNiro fan. Yet I found myself struggling to care to finish this movie. I struck a middle ground and rated this 3 stars. It is not the worst movie I have ever seen, yet it is nothing like I had hoped for."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"I was really looking forward to this movie well before it came out. You have Deniro and Norton. Surely this has got to have some substance. Not. Basically you have Norton's character ""Gerald 'Stone' Creeson"", doing hard time, hoping to make the parole board on one end. Jovovich's character ""Lucetta Creeson"" as the wife who can't keep her legs closed long enough. And Deniro's ""Jack Mabry"" as a man who has influence on how the parole board will act on Stone's case. Stone does what he has to do, knowing how loose a woman his wife is in terms of influencing Mr. Mabry's judgment. This is what this movie is about mainly, yet the director lost his way somewhere hitting this out of the ballpark even with this cast."
2,"Great for film buffs, not for everyday watchers","You'd think with an all-star cast this movie couldn't lose but it did just that. It lost me about 1/2 way through. I did watch the whole movie but quite honestly lost interest after I found the story to be lacking greatly. Its dubbed a psycho-drama and it lives up to that title, but for all the wrong reasons. If you like confusing stories than rent/buy this, however I recommend you read a few more of the reviews to understand what you could be in for."
3,Well shot and acted but pompous script,"This movie is kind of pompous the way it is. It has all the pieces of a good movie except the characterizations don't really make sense; looks good, acting is good, pace is good, just ends up hollow at the end. The writer seemed to be going for a ""No Country for Old Men"" type morally ambiguous ending which means it attempts to wrap the story up in a nice bow without actually wrapping it up in a nice bow; didn't work because he failed to flesh out the themes he introduced earlier (like the pseudo-religion Norton found in jail). It's a decent rental or bargain bin movie just don't expect it to change your outlook on life."
3,At least my wife liked it,"Okay, whats not to like with this movie? You have DeNiro, Norton, and the beautiful Mila Jovovich. Perhaps 3 of my favorite actors on one screen. The problem is that this movie is, in my opinion, very slow. It took me 4 tries to watch the whole thing all the way through. My wife on the otherhand, liked the movie and doesn't understand why I was so critical. Before Amazon.com offered it to me, I had never heard of this movie. So I went to the IMDB and saw that the opening weekend didn't break 6 figures worldwide and that it had a $20M budget. So, either the movie makers wanted to lose money, or others thought it was as bad as I did. Sorry, but this film is not for me and if I had paid for this video, I would have felt ripped off."
3,not the best use of Deniro,"I'm all about depressing movies, where all the characters are generally unlikable. I'm also totally okay with vague endings, that aren't neatly wrapped up. I would imagine that most of these two things would annoy most people. The characters were interesting, but it just didn't come together for me. The main story (the arson) felt peppered into a dull, dry, Lifetime-esque movie. The side stories took over and didn't really add anything worthwise, they didn't mesh together well, and ultimately the side stories just burned though time. Like I said the actor's performances were all really good, and convincing, but the story just didn't click with me. I felt unsatisfied at the end of this one."
3,"Great performances, Story Could Use Some Work","Stone tells the story of a retiring PO who catches the case of Creeson (aka Stone). The story doesn't pull any punches, and there are no real protagonists in the film. Everyone kind of exists, although Stone clearly has an agenda. The acting in this is top notch - Edward Norton, Mila Jovovich, and Robert DeNiro all give this film their best effort. However, this movie feels like one of those where the acting elevated the story, but the story just couldn't be elevated enough. It's worth a watch, but probably no more than that."
1,Terrible script leads to disaster,"For some reason, Amazon will not post my lengthy review about how horrible this movie is. I'm suspecting it's because I'm honest and thoughtful about why this movie has so many problems. So, I guess I'll have to wrap up my 500 word review with this brief attempt: ""Stone"" is one of the worst films I've seen in years. Terrible script, ponderous acting, predictable storyline, and awful editing. Walk away from this movie!Anyone interested in reading my full review, let me know."
2,Four great actors doing their best to save a script with a lot of open space and a story that tries to be thought provoking,"The acting is first rate. De Niro/Norton, De Niro/Jovoich, De Niro/Conroy, Norton/Jovoich, ... (don't want to give away anything) all provide chemistry that is both outstanding and subdued.That said, I found myself wanting this slow moving movie to be over. In part because I wanted to see how it would end (that's a good thing) and in part because the long pauses, poignant stares, and ineffective attempt to make this a thought provoking treatise in morality, ethics, and the meaning of life got a bit boring.Bottom line, buy/rent it for the acting but don't expect to be completely drawn in by what the actors are saying."
2,actors looking for a plot,More of an acting exercise than anything else. If the audience were stoned they might be happier at the end.
2,Moved at the pace of a stone,"You would figure that a film with two great actors and one great actress would be awesome. Well, it wasn't. The movie was slow, confusing and contradictory. The motivation for each character was never explained. Also, it appeared that all of the characters reached some sort of new understanding at the end of the movie, but we are not sure because it ends at that point. I sat through almost two hours of a slow-moving movie to get no explanation or closure!? The one positive thing that I can say is that as expected, the three main characters delivered great acting. Yet it was very hard to empathize with them because I couldn't understand the what or why of their actions. So, unless you are in an ultra-mellow mood (""ready to be bored"")don't watch this movie. You have been forewarned."
2,Lost its way,"Started out good, lost its way ..... which is sad considering Robert DeNiro's in it, which was the reason I bought it."
3,STONE COLD,"STONE has a lot going for it:ROBERT DE NIRO's performance as world weary case managerEDWARD NORTON's turn as desperate Stone whose redemption coincides with DeNiro's fall from graceA surprisingly good performance from MILLA JOVAVICH as Stone's manipulative and shallow wife;and FRANCES CONROY's role as DeNiro's imprisoned wife.Despite the great acting, the film's script and direction just didn't ""grab"" me. It seemed long and sometimes plodding. I appreciated the acting, but didn't really enjoy it wholly."
2,disappointing considering the cast,"You'd think that a movie starring Robert DeNiro, Edward Norton, and Milla Jojovich would have a pretty good chance to be great. In this case though, you'd be sadly mistaken. Stone is one of these ""prestige"" type of movies that just takes itself too seriously and tries too hard to be deep and memorable. Instead it manages to be merely mediocre. It's pretty obvious where the plot is going from very early on in the movie, it just takes forever to get there, through many painful-to-watch scenes. I wasn't entertained by it, and I can't recommend it."
2,"Great Acting, But...","The information I read to select this movie did not really tell me whether it would have a satisfying ending or not. It sounded by what I read as if it would. Well, it doesn't.The story is dark, which I don't care for. The acting is so good that I did manage to watch it all. I don't recall one instant of humor. It wasn't touching emotionally, either.There is a lot of ""religion"" in it, but yet there isn't. Really, there isn't any. Just words, not actions.The ending is very fuzzy. What happens? Heck if I know.I actually like Robert DeNiro in comedies! And he is an ace actor in anything. The other acting in this movie is all good. But the plot, gracious."
1,Boring,As a thriller it tanks. As a psychological duel it fairs a bit better. Wasn't particularly impressed with either DeNiro or Jovovich but it's worth checking out for Ed Norton's superb performance. Just don't expect it to live up to the marketing.
2,"Hi, my name is Robert. Do you have a TV show I can star in?","If you like the concept of watching Robert De Niro die a metaphorical death onscreen,this movie is for you.Why is Edward Norton wearing those cornrows? Why does he have that stupid ghetto accent?Seriously, the only reason to watch this flick is for Milla Jovovich who is hotter than anArkansas Rembrandt. Otherwise this is a one star piece of crap, like the biggest one starPOC I have ever seen OK!De Niro is about to join Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda in the ""I Should Have Retired YearsAgo Club"". This movie drags, is depressing, and would be semi-disturbing if you cared, butyou wont. Watch at your own risk, you've been warned. 2 Brake Pads"
1,THE LANGUAGE IS LOWEST OF THE LOW,"A little cussing in a film is fine. It has to be completely natural though.In this film, it's just pasted on too thick--for me. Enough is enough.Brilliant author Harold Klemp has pointed out that swearing lowers consciousnessand polluted the atmospheres. So if you want to lower your ""vibe,""see the film. I know the character is a real bad guy, but stillthe cussing didn't fly for me."
2,WHAT DA WASTED TWO GREAT ACTROS!!!!!!!!,"If you are interested in watching some really great actors waste their (and your) time with a boring, drawn out, depressing story that goes nowhere, says nothing, has no redeeming moral story, then watch this abortion of a movie. I can find enough things to be depressed about in everyday life without watching these people show us how sordid their lives are. I just don't get how such outstanding actors got conned into this steaming pile of crap.(Plus, they probably got paid well to make it. It is a sad commentary on Hollywood, and the self anointed elite who think that we little people out here should be dazzled by the sophistication and nuance of this drivel) Run like your hair is on fire. C"
1,105 minutes gone from my life - forever,"This should have been a stellar movie - Robert DeNiro, Edward Norton, and Milla Jovovich. Even a decent idea for a plot. BUT IT DID NOT WORK!I do not remember any other DeNiro or Norton movie that I've had a hard time staying awake during. This movie was beyond stultifying. Repetitious, convoluted plot. Stilted acting.PROS:Norton's cornrows - unusual look for himJovovich's beauty and sex appeal - at least some guys will watch just to see herCONS: Too many to list other than ones shown above.I guess all actors have to appear in a stinker now and then just as a benchmark to measure how truly good they are in the winners."
2,No Plot. No Ending.,"This movie failed to offer a climax or an ending. I'm not even sure if it had a plot. There were too many loose ends that went unanswered, the main one being Why? What was the gain, the purpose of Norton and his wife toying with his parole officer in this way? The film never explained it. The movie is also saturated with religiosity. Again, I ask why.Norton was at his best, but De Niro was miscast as a doddering old fool. I kept wondering how he could be so stupid as to allow himself to be drawn into Norton's sick game.There is nudity and many sexual situations in this movie, as well as foul language.If the viewer had been given a reason why all this stuff took place, the movie might have scored high marks. It wasn't until the credits started to roll that I realized I just wasted two hours of my time."
3,STONE,IF YOU HAVE TIME AND SEE THE NAMES LIKE DENIRO YOU HAVE TO SEE THE MOVIE BUT GOD FATHER IS A BETOFF HIS CALIBER
1,Don't waste your money,"Boy oh boy did De Niro ever goof taking this job. This film was unbearable to watch. About the only folks who will enjoy this are bible thumpers. ( no disrespect ) The idea was good, but so much more could have been done to make it a watchable film. It was a huge disappointment. If you suffer from insomnia, then this will put you to sleep for sure. Don't waste your money is my advice to you."
2,"Great acting, poor story","It takes a lot for me to write a bad review. Watched this last night on Netflix and I was pretty disappointed. As you'd expect, the acting was good but the plot/story left a lot to be desired, unless you enjoy boring movies about people leading lives of quiet desperation (only way I can think of to describe it). Unless you're extremely bored, I would pass on this one.Ryan Hoover, author of Immortal Implements"
2,Comes up with many disk read errors -- save your money,Save your money -- there are much better products out there -- this one is not ready for prime time -- looses data and is not very reliable
2,MEGA Travel Trouble,"I purchased two 4Gb MEGATravel Drives and one of them didn't work right out of the box. Memorex replaced it with a 6Gb drive and I was happy. But, I used the 4Gb drive heavily and after less than a year it just quit working. The computer sees it but it won't start and so my data is totally lost. I've corresponded back and forth with Memorex tech services for the last two or three weeks and they were of no help. I even offered to buy a new drive and canabalize it to put the disk from the old one into, but Memorex tells me that won't work and ""would void the warranty"". Go Figure!Quite frankly, if you own one, offload all your files quickly and then trash the drive. Get four 1Gb flash drives with no moving parts and go on with your life, that is what I've done and they are cheaper by a long shot as well."
1,piece of junk,"Had one for a month, just quit working one day. I have many other thumb drives that have been going strong for years. I wont purchase another of these."
1,Be wary of this company,"I purchased a second 1GB Travel drive to mate up with one that had been working fine. The second drive is a different version (although they look identical) which does not work with my computer. There is no question that my computer is older technology having had a WIN 98 O/S which I upgraded to WIN ME. After talking with tech support and trying all the recommended solutions, tech support recommended I get a replacement or refund under their warranty program. Bottom line, they passed the buck: not their problem - ""...go contact your computer manufacturer"". So I'll be selling my Memorex drives on EBAY and recommend you think twice before purchasing this product. Also, it took a month to get a reply in the first place!"
3,Not what you might think it is!,"This is an OK product for what I'm using it for. I have a Nikon D200 and wanted to be able to charge two batteries at the same time- This is not the case. It only charges one battery at a time. I probably should have researched and read more information about this charger before making the purchase. I'm going to return this item, it's not a bad product, I want to be able to charge two batteries at the same time. I'm going to use two MH-18's instead. One other thing, you can't refresh EN-EL3e batteries with the MH-19. The car adapter plug is a plus."
2,Misleading and overpriced,"Nikon's recommended price for this product is an absolute joke!As others have mentioned this product charges one battery after another - which is perfect for overnight charging, but not if you need to quickly charge batteries in the field. It is also by no means a travel charger. The thing is HUGE and bulky. Much larger than 2 of the standard D200/D70 chargers - especially surprising given that it doesnt charge two batteries simulataneously.I got it because I lost my original charger (whcih I still hope to find), and its definitely nice to be able to charge two batteries overnight but definitely would be a letdown had I paid the full recommended price!"
2,Two MH-18 are better and cheaper than one MH-19.,"You can put two batteries simultaneously in the MH-19. But the batteries are not charged simultaneously. First, one is charged, then the other is charged.The MH-19 is priced at $114.95 plus $8.95 for shipping.The MH-18 is priced at $39.46 with free prime shipping.You should buy two MH-18, have the ability to charge simultaneously, AND save $44.96.My MH-19 is several years old, and it has operated flawlessly; however, the price to value ratio is wrong. I have several MH-18, and they are just as reliable."
2,NOT a double Charger - Don't be fooled,"This product only charges ONE battery at a time. Something not mentioned on the Nikon site.The only reason I'm keeping this is I travel by car a lot, and it has the option to charge via 12v. Aside from that, I'd be better off buying a second single charger."
2,Nikon MH-19 Multi Battery Charger,"It appears the charger does not charge two batteries simultaneous, rather it seems it charges them sequential which of course takes twice the time!One is better off with two individual chargers!"
5,"Fiesta 5 ounce miniature disk pitcher, scarlet!",This is a great little pitcher...just so cute & very well made. It's a beautiful red and I love having it in my kitchen. It was packaged well and came in perfect condition!
5,Beautiful and Tiny Fiestaware Pitcher,This Fiestaware pitcher is beautiful and perfect for cream for one. Focus on the word miniature. This is a very small pitcher! Great addition to my Fiestaware collection.
4,fiestaware mini pitcher,Was glad to be able to find what I was looking for. My sister asked for these for her birthday and could not find them in stores. Macy carries fiestaware as do other stores but not the mini disc pitcher.The only complaint I had was the size of box which upped the shipping.Sue
3,Wups,"I didn't know that it was 5 oz, not sure how I messed that up. I sent it back and ordered the full size one. Both arrived promptly in new condition."
5,Love this!,"This is the perfect little pitcher to own for serving creamer or milk for coffee or tea. It's a wonderful compliment to the rest of the Fiestaware line of serving items. Not only for everyday use, but also for parties. However, I do recommend that you order more than one if you do plan on using them for many people. Mix and match the colors for a beautiful table setting!"
4,4 3/4 ounces is SMALL,"I absolutely adore Fiestaware and this color is wonderful...it's a brick redish tone. However, when I ordered it I didn't realize just how small it would be. I was imagining a creamer size pitcher and this is almost an ""individual size"" creamer. Similar to a size you'd get at a restaurant for your coffee. That having been said, the quality is wonderful, and it's Fiesta, so it's still worth 4 stars. A super piece to add to a Fiesta table."
3,Although cute...,for a Fiestaware lover. What purpose (aside from decoration) is this pitcher supposed to serve? I have a cream and sugar set already.
5,This book is proven to be life-changing and effective.,"Reading this book is one of the best think I've done in my whole life. It has changed my outlook in life. It changed the way I approached everyday living. After reading the book, there was a tremendous impact in the way my family life, my relationships, my career and my studies have changed. I used to be a law student who didn't know where I was heading and was afraid to take chances. But now, I know where I'm headed, I've set the goals I want to achieve and I've put myself in a development plan where I continually improve and better myself. I'm reading more of John Maxwell's books and applying it to my everyday living. I'm listening to at least two positive preaching tapes every week and I'm also reading a postive-thinking book every two weeks. Through John Maxwell, I realized my potential in life. God has used him as an instrument to change me. And although I haven't met him personally, I consider him my mentor."
4,Need an attitude adjustment? Read this book,"Thank you Mr. Maxwell for writing this book, it is sorely needed in the church today. Learning the hard way, I discovered years ago that a negative attitude is a church killer. People, especially baby boomers and busters will not stay at a church where the pastor does not have a winning attitude.The greatest strength in this book is found in Maxwell's optimism. A winning attitude does not have to be the exclusive property of those who have natural charisma, but can be developed by anyone who is willing to pay the price. Maxwell, not only informs the reader how to develop a winning attitude, but also gives the reader personal application guides to help the reader put what he has just read into action. Are there any weaknesses in this book? Perhaps so, but they elude me. What Maxwell says is so essential for successful leadership that this book is a must read for those leaders who struggle with their attitude."
5,This is a great...,"book! This can help straighten out your attitude, especially if you are always negative. If you already have a positive attitude, it's still great! :)"
1,a let down - written by a preachy pastor,"a word of warning to those for whom a warning is in order.this book is written by a christian pastor, who quotesfrom the bible approximately every other page. i didn'twant this kind of book, and want to make it clear to peopleout there like me, who aren't looking for subliminalevangelism, that this book has a subtle tendency to proselytise.None of the amazon reviewers made this clear enough,I thought."
3,Average Computer Speakers; Recommend with Reservations,"Great Aspects:These speakers are fairly small but still project sound well. Volume is not a problem. It is obviously very simple to use.Downside:Sound clarity isn't perfect and you can tell that the sound is coming ""from computer speakers."" Bass is okay but nothing to get excited over. The headphone connection doesn't work very well, resulting in a distinct hissing when using headphones (so just plug the headphones right into the sound jack of the computer).Summary:These are average computer speakers and should be considered if the price is good such as a cheap upgrade at an online computer store. The speakers get the job done but in an ordinary fashion.Recommend with Reservations."
1,Pay a little more and get better speakers,"When the volume is turned up about 1/3 way, there is crackling in the speakers. Other people have complained about that as well. I would pay a little more and get something better."
4,Great speakers for what they are.......,"This is the exact speaker the I.T. department gave me at work. For a laptop with limited deskspace, these are great sounding, so I got a pair for home. True audiophiles or gamers may not be impressed, but I happen to think they have great sound and fit my needs. Plus, they are small enough to be somewhat portable.I tried to buy these locally, but the style/model has changed and I really did not care for the stand on the newer model as it looked really cheap, and not well put together. The stand on these older style speakers looks much better and appears to be much sturdier.Any big box retailer has a selection of 2.0 channel PC speakers in this price range, but some have such a low output, they are not even worth trying. These CA speakers are a cut above."
5,Amazing this great book has not been reviewed?,"Well organized book.Covers five methods of interpretations: Literal, allegorical....Considers four gaps: Linguistic, cultural....110 pages develop 19 basic principles.Context principleFirst mention principleElection principleCovenantal principleEtc....Each section has a clear and interesting discussion with examples.This approach made my exploration enjoyable, reduced frustration and saved me time.Interpreting The Scripturesby Kevin Conner needs to stay in print."
3,A must have for the biblical scholar's library,I found this book the be very useful in understanding how to interpret scripture line upon line and precept upon precept. This is must have for the bible scholar's library.
1,Baloney Well Done,"No matter how old I get, I'm always amazed by how thinly some people are able to slice the baloney."
2,Boring,"I got this book thinking it'd be a great Vietnam war novel. For the first few chapters it was, but most of the rest of it are flashbacks to when the main character began his career in the Marines. Ultimately, it read like a long-winded biographical sketch. If the author had stuck to the plot, this would've been a much better book."
5,great,A great little book.It really was a help during this time of ribulation that i am going through.
4,More of a History than a Philosophical Examination,"This ""Short History"" of Buddhism attributed to Edward Conze (1904-1979)was copyrighted after his death by Muriel Conze in 1980, 1982, and 1983, and first published 1993, according the publication information page. It is not to be confused with Conze's popular ""Buddhism: Its Essence and Development"" (New York: Philosophical Library, 1951) although it may be seen as a useful supplement to that work.After a half-century Conze still has important ideas to clarify for us and is well worth a re-read."
4,an excellent work for young readers,"i first read this book at 20 and wished someone had handed it to me at 15, maybe some of the things im still working out as an adult would have surfaced in me at a younger age. the book truly captures the magical relationship between two girls, all of the uncertainties and the awkwardness. it is a must read."
4,Sweet Story of Young Lesbian Love,"I'm pleased this book exists for young women to read and, hopefully, feel more validated in their same-sex feelings. The growing love between two teenaged girls is drawn sensitively and realistically. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the way that everyone they know just wholeheartedly embraces their open lesbianism is unbelievable. Much of what young lesbians must endure and overcome is harassment and disapproval from those they know, and it surprised me that that part of the experience was ignored."
3,A powerful story told by a female YA's poing of view.,"My preconceieved ideas about gay people made this book a hard read at first, but while I was reading the story, I forgot that it was a girl talking about her lesbian realtionship with another girl. So strong are the feelings of love between these two people. I have a different view about people in general. If a person loves another person, the feelings are just like those that we feel for our spouses of the opposite sex. This book will mirror the life of many of our confused young adults. Perhaps it will allow them to see that they are not ""weird"" but different, and that they are not the only gay people in the world. Perhaps it will help them see that they are not ""gay"". It is definitely not a book that will turn someone gay if they read it. It is just not a ""read"" that is appropriate for every young adult. I would not encourage a young adult to read it unless they insisted that they were looking for that particular book. AC."
3,This book is a about two females falling in love,In my opinion Annie On My Mind deserves three stars. It's a heart-filled love story between two females. It shows how their families accepted it. Through the trials and tribulations they went through it made me see things from a different light. If I were you I would read it.
2,What a bore!,"I'm sorry...but seriously...this book just bored me to tears. I understand how important this book is for young lesbian teens who feel confused, lost, alone, etc. on their feelings about other girls...but i couldn't get past most chapters without just feeling bored to tears. I felt like the whole story was so wooden, the characters are not interesting, and the way they talk and react with one another is just not realistic to me, its just...well, a bit too flowery and trying too hard to be poetic and deep. I don't clearly understand why they have this chemistry either...I just don't understand the hype surrounded by this book. Lesbian lovers, great! But that alone doesnt necessarily make a good story."
1,Help!,Why can't I get a copy of this not audible? Do they not offer one?? Please help! I used to have a paperback version but it was ruined in a fire..
5,a rare story which outlines the signs and progression of true love,"Annie on My Mind is the quintessential story of two young women exploring love for the first time. It is the reminiscience of Liza, now a freshman in college, about her relationship to Annie during the previous year. First published in 1982, the story aided the cultural validation of lesbian love. Thsi 25th edition includes an interview with the author which complements the story. Annie on My Mind is included on school reading lists, and usually cannot be found on the library's shelves. What readers will find is not a 'butch/macho/lesbian' scenario, but a tender story of two persons innocently adn naively exploring their natural inclinations towrds first love. The heart of the story is taht their love becomes an enduring love, a reare feat. Readers, bi-curious or straight, young or old, hunger to learn the signs and progression of true love, as outlined in this story. This (along with good writing) is what keeps this book in print."
4,Classic.,"Everyone should read this book if for no other reason than the fact that it is considered the young lesbian staple book. It's aimed towards younger readers, I'd say 16 years or younger, but don't let that stop you from reading it if you're older. It delves into complex emotions in a simplistic, refreshing way, which is nice when you're not as familiar with gay books. Definitely a beginner's book to lesbian love."
5,Just One Word: Poignant,"I read this book in college (hiding it because it was 'Gay' & worse because it was a 'Teen' book).This book lifted my spirits & broke my heart. And yet some times when I drive through NYC, I wish that these two girls, now woman, could be real and living together. A wonderful book, wonderfuly written"
5,Magnificent,"I rented this book out at my local library, and I would have to say that reading it was some of the greatest non-educational reading that I've done for quite some time. I really did enjoy this book very much, and it was tastefully done in a wholesome way. I definately recomend this book to anyone who even looks at it out of curiosity."
5,a magical book,"""Annie"" is one of the books I take everywhere with me. Knowing that it's on my shelf, available in case I want to pick it up again, gives me enormous comfort.My reaction to it is so emotional that I hesitate to comment on specifics. Yes, the writing is good, the characters are believable. It's not a perfect book: the part of the plot that involves Liza's school feels tedious or at least dated. But, taken as a whole, ""Annie on My Mind"" is stunning and inspiring.I don't know of any better book for teenagers who are questioning their sexuality...or for anyone else looking for an exceptionally honest and sensitive book about first love."
3,Pain to Set Up,It works but only if you are desperate. I used it on a PDA- it was a lot of effort to get it to work.
2,subwoofer,only worked for a couple weeks before blowing sub. paperwork claims 800 rms or nominal power my amp runs only 400 rms watts i ran both coils in an 8 ohm configue being there 4 ohm coils blew both coils at same time it could not hold the power it claimed. this was also after break in running 100 rms watts to each coil for approx 4 8 hr days.
5,"Practical, Specific Estimation Advise","In my past I have read other articles on software estimation and those articles are too lightweight or not credible. Steve McConnell (my guru!) in this book presents loads of practical tips with just enough theories to make them credible. Most so-called experts treat estimation as a black art. Steve McConnnell explains which parts really are a black art and which parts just need to be understood better.This book has 118 specific tips but it is worth buying just for the first 10! Very practical, very hands-on, very easy to improve my estimates!!!"
5,Steve is the real magician!,"Whenever I read McConnell's books, I was shocked by his talent to explain the complex idea and situation with real easy explanations.This book is great for both the software managers and practicioners. Strongly recommened if you suffer with ""Estimation, Goal, Target, Plan"" confusions."
5,If you estimate software cost and effort YOU MUST READ THIS,"If you have been or will start estimating software, then you must read this book. You will be introduced to many different estimation techniques, albiet some at a high level.However, if you are serious about truely developing software estimation as a professional skill the book is loaded with references and cites to many more sources which are very detailed in nature. It is worthwhile to start here and identify the technique(s) that will work best for your organization then get into the details of actually applying.On a different note, this book does sum up to a subtle sales pitch of Construx estimating software, which the author of the book was a critical figure in creating. However, the sales pitch doesn't get in the way of you still learning alot about the field of sotware estimation.I have re-read some chapters, particularly towards the back of the book, countless time."
4,Alternative title: Demystifying software estimation,"What I liked most: This book is short (no verbose, no grandiloquent style), there are real life examples and finally there is industry data.What I didn't like: The chapter 12 ""Proxy-based estimates""...I think this is out of the scope of the book: fuzzy-logic...perhaps it could be possible to reduce the size from 300pp to 150 pp."
4,Excellent software engineering book backed up by solid empirical studies,"Honesty, I was expecting very ""soft"" content, i.e., pages spent over-analyzing obvious points and so on. BUT this description could not be farther from the truth. In Software Estimation, McConnell draws on over a hundred published studies on the topic of software estimation as well as numerous case studies. The book is data driven and based on statistical techniques. McConnell emphases counting concrete project steps and comparing them with previous estimates where as intuiting off-the-cuff estimates is a major no-no."
2,Bought on great Reviews but....,"After reading how good Caig Progold is, I decided to try it and clean the connections on my stereo. After complete and careful application of this stuff, I was disappointed at the sound of the stereo. I am using all Ayre electonics with Vandersteen 5A speakers. After using Progold, the quality of the system has seemed to lost its magic. Perhaps it has to be broken in again. If the sound doesn't improve to its previous level, I will clean the cables again trying to remove the Progold."
4,Very nice camera.......White balance still not accurate,"Very nice camera, especially for just that price.With many convenient buttons that you can directly switch to the funtion you want, saved a lot from browsing and choosing from menu items.Just like *istDL, K110D and K100D, the white balance still not accurate. Mostly too yellowish, especially under tungsten lights. Sometimes even with customized WB still too much yellow that I have to remove it using software after shooting."
4,Good DSLR,"K10d is a really good camera. I tried Canon xt and xti before but both are small and don't fit my big hand. the size of K10d is alright! and it provided powerful manual adjustment for your catching pictures. The kit lens is also very good as basic lens.The Body SR function makes every lens perform very well when you hold it with shaky hands. I hate Canon and Nikon because they refuse to add Shake reduction function on the camera body so that they can sell SR lens at higher price.The only drawbacks low light performance is not as good as C and N. Focus speed is a little bid slow. Also the auto WB is not perfect. But you can adjust to get it right manually.Overall, it is a good DSLR."
2,Pentax software is not ready for Mac Leopard,"Having read all the reviews on the camera, I bought one with the 18-250 Pentax lens. I have been using a Lumix FZ50 and decide to try a DSL and this seemed to be it. Shooting in raw would be an advantage and did not want to spend months learning Adobe. I tried to install the Pentax software on my Mac Leopard with no luck. Pentax is working on the software for the Leopard but no word when it will be ready. It could be months and new model Pentaxs are coming out in less than a month. Frankly, aside from the faster shutter, my Lumix FZ50 had far better results with its stabilizing system. I was disappointed and returned the camera."
4,Great camera,"I was pleasant surprised with K10D as it combines built-in image stabilization, self-cleaning sensor, easy-to-use image controls and sealed body. It's just fills right in my hands. I'm not going to repeat all good pints that can be found in previous reviews. But I want to comments on some ""Cons"". Yang from MI point out that: ""10M is not much bigger than 6M (*ist DL), it is good to have but don't expect a big difference..."" More pixels isn't give you better image. You wouldn't see a difference on 5X6 or 8X10 in print. But if you want to print 24X36 in print this when you need more pixels. Overall it's a GREAT camera and a big step forward from istDS/K100 series cameras. I like that K10 has more controls on the body that before was bared in menus. I like RAW button big time. What hold me from give K10D five stars it's AF. Even AF much improved from DS still not as fast as Nikon D70S. Highly recommended."
5,Terrific DSLR camera!,This is my first SLR camera and i'm in awe by the image quality this camera produces. Very easy to learn with plenty of features to keep me busy for some time before I upgrade. I definitely recommend this camera to any photographer looking for a solid built camera at an affordable price. Only issue I foresee is the 100$ rebate as it seems the company responsible for the rebates aren't processing them in a timely manner.
5,short and sweet,"My previous camera was a non-digital Canon Rebel. Needing a creative arts class credit, I took a digital photography class and shot with a borrowed Nikon D70. After reading these reviews and other online reviews, the camera I purchased was the Pentax K10D and I am very pleased with my choice. This camera, although a little heavier, is top of the line!"
5,Pentax Fan,"I've waited a long time for this camera. Have several Pentax film camera's, but the prwvious batch of DSLR couldn't compete against film. Glad they have finally reached 10 megs. Haven't used all menu options yet. Too many? We'll see.Only negative to date, Camera heavier then fil cameras. This was Pentax claim to fame over the other major brands- lightness."
2,"Hard to get sharp photos, even in decent light","I wish I had read the few negative comments regarding lack of sharpness with the K10D sooner. Evan when I'm outdoors it's hard to get crisp photos no matter what I do. I have had this camera for over two years and have been driving myself crazy thinking I'M doing something wrong. But when I have picked up friends' Canons or Nikons recently and snapped a few photos, they always seem so crisp so I began to suspect it was my camera. Now I see that others have had the same issue. Not sure if it's a defect with certain units or just a quirk with the model. Unfortunately I am way past the warranty but I look forward to getting a new DSLR some day."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought a Pentax K10D two years ago. The camera seemed to work well, but several months ago the image sensor went bad- pictures were in magenta and blue. Returning it to Pentax for repair, I got a quote for repair of $400! Their lousy sensor goes bad, and because it was past their feeble one-year warranty, Pentax will do nothing to correct what is clearly faulty manufacturing or parts. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of Pentax- they will not support their products, and your money would be much better spent on another manufacturer!"
1,pain of 1 year with Pentax K10D,"I owned this for an year. You cannot say it is a very good camera. It is just a below average camera.I bought it for close to 1000 $I could have taken maximum of 2000 pictures with it.Also recently it suddenly started showing battery depleted symbol. Contacted pentax, they suggested to send to a third party who does the repair (Note:- All pentax official repair will be done by third party shop)Currently the third party repair shope is saying, it is not the problem with battery it is the problem with reflex mirror, stuck in the apperture...etc. They are asking for close 300$ for repair.Now I realize that with my experiances with Nikon, Canon etc..Overall...Pentax was not worth for the money I spend.Please spend wisely.."
3,I must have got a lemon,I currently own and I am fairly happy with a Pentax Ist DS. I own several Pentax lenses. I was very dissappointed with the K10D. I got much clearer shots with my Ist DS. I tried all the tweeks I have read in several reviews. I even shot in RAW mode and post processed in Photoshop. I hope I just got a lemon. Thank god for Amazon's return policy otherwise I would have probably been stuck with it. I am afraid I am going to bite the bullet and go with the Nikon D200.
5,Amendment,"I wrote an earlier review posted here and commented about Mr. Jaconson's references to his other books. I recently recieved an email from the author where he explained some of his reasons for doing so. Key among those reasons was the fact that he often had limited space available due to restraints set by the publisher and wanted to explain where more information could be found. While I still think the refrences can be slightly distracting I now understand Mr. Jacobson's reasons for doing so and thought I should share that information to be read with my previous review. I also noticed in rereading my previous review that it sounded much more harsh than I had intended. Let me be clear: this is an excellent book, well written and filled with great information, and I certainly would reccomend it. My complaint was and is a minor one and shouldn't keep you from purchasing this great book about camping and canoeing."
4,large letter on yellow keys help,"The size of the letters and the yellow keys are certainly helpful if you have presbyopia or other visual problems. It would be even better if they lit up. The feel of the keys is different from the keyboard I have been using, it seems this one needs a bit more pressure, but I have adjusted to that"
3,made of plastic,"I thought this shower head was metal, not plastic. Works OK. Hope it holds up as long as metal."
3,Reduces water flow... whether you want it to or not!,"While the valve works as expected... you can shut the water flow down to a trickle... what I didn't expect was it would limit the shower head regardless of where the valve was set! Looking at the valve, it's not a surprise. The opening inside the valve is only about 1/4 of an inch or so. So, if you still want to have the same flow as before, don't buy this valve. If on the other hand, your intent is to reduce the amount of water, this will do it."
3,cute and fluffy,"I do like funny romances, and for that alone, I would recommend this one, really for that alone. The romance was light, with little conflict, and even less interest. The 2 main characters, started out well (you'll just love Annie at the beginning), but by the middle they were flat and unmotivated. And the end was so anti-climatic! Everything romantic in this book after the shopping scene (with the possible exception of the carnival) was dull as ditch water.The saving grace of this book was the minor characters, a druggie-doctor, a lawyer who cheats at golf, a stiff butler, and a whole passle of relatives so coniving they get tangled in the strings from thier own plotting. Over it all sits Archie, the patriarch, and he is so dispicable, you really can't decide whether to love him or loathe him.Anyway, read it if you have some time to kill, and you want a light, funny book with little to no involvement"
3,"Decent light, but just ok.","This product does come with a wiring harness, but that is where the good things stop.There is no relay, they rely on a switch to cary the full power something I don't trust. Additionally there is no way to replace the bulbs in the lights, so when you have one burn out you will be buying a whole new set.I ordered 2 sets of these, and once I opend up the first package, I cancled the seccond order. I will find another use for these, but not as driving lights."
2,Quite a disappointment,"I bought this CD thinking I was acquiring ""original"" recordingssince there weren't any writings on the cover that indicatedotherwise. Although the re-recordings are nicely done, youimmediatley notice that you didn't get the real stuff whichto me is always a disappointment. For those of you who demandoriginal recordings don't get this one!"
1,"Good idea, poor execution","I'm a frequent mini-muffin maker and the most time-consuming task is getting the batter into the tins. This seemed like such a great idea that I bought two. But when you tip it to pour the batter, it doesn't glide down the spout into the tin. It slops over the sides of the spout and spills everywhere. No matter how carefully you try to pour, the spout is just too small to handle batter. If the spout were a true funnel--a measuring cup with a closed spout that wouldn't allow spills--it would work fine. But a tiny spout that's open at the top is a disaster."
4,Great idea,"This little pitcher has a lon-n-ng funnel neck that makes it perfect for filling my coffeepot and for pouring liquids into my kitchenaid mixer bowl without being too bulky to store. It's only downside is that it's fairly lightweight - I don't expect it to last forever, but the price is right. I would be an excellent design for a heavy glass measuring cup. If this one quits - I will have to get another."
1,The spout is way too narrow.,"I bought this for pancake batter but it's not good for anything but liquids. I gave it to my husband, it's in the garage and he loves it."
5,cooking tools,This is the handiest tool I have used in years. It helps sloppy me avoid spills and keeps everything neat.
1,Norpro measuring funnel junk junk junk,Piece of junk. Huge mess!! Okay for pouring water in the dog bowl. But so is a glass made brownies with chic chips mixed in and attempted to pour in mini muffin pan what a huge mess. And disappointment
2,it look big in the picture and cheap. what u paid is what u get,"open up and it go straight to junk box in the garage. i can't return it, it cost more for the shippping."
4,Great Item for Watering African Violets,"****This funnel pitcher is the perfect size with the perfect spout for watering my African violets and not getting any water on their leaves. It is very easy to clean, and much cheaper than mini watering pitchers. In addition, mini pitchers are hard to clean beacuse of their closed spouts. This spout is open, and a snap to clean.It is not the absolute most well-made thing I've ever seen; in fact, it's a tad flimsy. Also the numbers for the measurements are small, close together, and the same color as the surrounding pitcher, thus not easily readable. Neither of these problems bother me, but they may bother you, so you should be aware of them.For the money, it does exactly what I wanted it to do and my African violets are looking beautiful!Recommended.****"
5,Spout PItcher,I would even like a bigger pitcher. It is easy to pour water in a coffee pot with this pitcher. I like the size of the spout. I have nothing else to add to this review except that I do not like to have these requirements for words.carolyn
4,A Pre-Columbian Banquet,"This CD, recorded in Mexico, is a fairly adept attempt to recreate the music of the prehispanic indigenous people of Mexico. The instruments used are all quite authentic, with extensive liner notes on them. There were no notes on the actual recording or performers, so one is left to assume that all instruments and compositions are by Mr. Reyes. The music itself is at times haunting, airy, dark and light; one piece with vocals. This CD left me hungering for more, if there is more. The only shortcoming is the briefness of the recording; at 37 minutes I was hoping for more. I believe it was originally released on LP, which would explain the length. Viva La Raza!"
1,You may not be very glad that you bought this book.,This is a completely useless book that is full of many glossy pictures and little information.
2,Very unsatisfied,When trying to put the valance on the curtain rod we discovered the stitching was so uneven that the rod would not go in! I had to take out and re-stitch both the top and bottom stitching in order to hang it. For [money] I feel you should not have to alter anything!
2,Disappointed in the quality of the curtain..,I washed and ironed the curtains after one wash the stitching is coming undone. I am very disappointed for 20$ a curtain that they cannot even hold up after one wash. Although my mother-in-law can fix this and it will eventually look really cute in the nursery.
2,See through fabric,The problem with the window valance is that the material is not thick enough to prevent even a small amount of light shining through from both sides of what is meant to be a reversable pattern; ie) you can see the music notes and dark blue through the white side with the animals and you can see the animals from the white side on the dark blue side with the music notes. The quality should be improved to prevent this from happening.
3,You get what you pay for,"We purchased 25 of these headphones for a computer lab at our school. For the most part, the sound is decent, and they are relatively comfortable for the price. We selected this model because of the affordability and the reduced likelihood of anyone wanting to walk off with a pair due to the rather clunky and unattractive design. (And to that credit, none have walked off yet.)However, we've now had to dig the end of the headphone jack out of five computers, as five of our pairs have broken off inside the computer audio port, simply from regular plugging and unplugging of the headphones.So, they may save you money in the beginning, but I would highly recommend throwing them out after a year and buying replacements so you don't risk damaging your audio devices when the 1/8"" jack breaks off inside of them."
3,Meh,"Worked great for a couple of months but the left bud broke and makes some weird noises with low sounds. The cord is not like a spring, but plain, which is somewhat annoying sometimes (I use them to play guitar)."
3,Cord not coiled,"The main reason I ordered the headphones was because of the coiled cord (the actual words I used to search for them). Unfortunately, the cord is straight, but for the price it's not worth the bother to ship them back. As far as sound quality it seems slightly better than other headphones I have. Construction seems sturdy, and I wonder if the volume knob on each headphone couldn't have been replaced with a single volume control."
1,Poor construction,"one of ear pieces snapped off. The plastic holding it to the band has sheered. I go through headphones fast enough. Less than a week's use. No unusual stressing. never, ever buying from this brand again."
3,a good product,I feel this is a goood product and would recommend them to youthey are very comfortable and at a good price
2,Broke within 3 weeks,"the headphones themselves look nice, not a very comfortable fit, a little too tight ( and i have a average sized head) problem is three weeks into having them i get on a plane to vegas and one of the sides broke, i didnt want to drag a broken pair of headphones around on my trip so i ditched them on the plane, wished they wouldve lasted, but honestly they were so cheap i shouldn't have expected much. Buy them if you don't care about longevity or jst need a temporary pair. the sound quality was definitely good and they had convenient volume controls on each ear so you could balance them any way you want. overall you're getting what you paid for."
4,Picture are great,"Pro: The picture & sound are great.Con: when you change the channel in HD mode, you have to wait for that channel comes on before you can jump to the next one. For example: change channel 2 to 4, you have to wait for 4 comes before you can move to 5, 6 etc."
2,Grossly Overpriced,"Yes, this book contain some very useful information but it's relatively basic. I'm giving the book only two stars based mostly on price. This book sold for $14.95 in 1994 and yet some of the lowest selling prices are around $95. In all the years of buying books through Amazon this is hands-down the poorest value for the money. A more reasonable price might be between $30 and $40."
5,sweet,"this is the best game ever. i thought it wouldn't [be good] compared to Dave Mirra but it rocks. it is the best game i ever playeed, one night i was up all night playing it for 24 hours no lie!"
3,"Could have been better, but its ok","Pretty much Tony Hawk on a bike, Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX is a good bit of fun, and it is a lot better than the only other BMX game for Dreamcast, Acclaim's Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX. My only complaints are that its just not as fun as the Tony Hawk games, and it can be quite frustrating at times as well. Also, there is not much difference between this version and the PS1 version. The graphics are a bit better and the loading times are almost non-existent, but so much more could and should have been added to this package to makes this game a must have. All in all though, if your looking for a good sports game, and this is one of the last third party Dreamcast games, then you can't go wrong with Mr. Hoffman."
5,Excellent Devotional ~~~,This Daily Devotional is the best. I read it every morning and each night. There is truly a message for everyone in each of the readings. I find it very rewarding and highly recommend it.
5,A pathway to travel,In the midst of turbulent change and insecurity a quiet walk with a pause for reflection in a world bigger than what we can see. A peaceful contemplation of what it could be like to walk alongside the majestic and yet loving God introduced in these pages.
5,AGING OUTSIDE THE BOX,"You have heard the popular line - Think outside the box.FABULOUS AFTER 50 taught me how to AGE OUTSIDE THE BOX.The mission statement of this book -DISCOVER AGELESS LIVING AND ENDLESS ENERGY -----LIVE WITH POWER, STYLE, AND VITALITY, WITH FAITH, FUN AND FOCUS. The 11 aging successfully attitudes at the end of each chapter give a positive spin on aging."
3,The Legendary Crooners,I bought this for my 98 year old mother and she enjoys watching it. She and I would have liked it better if it had been in color which I did not see in the description. I have looked at other DVDs and it is hard to find whether or not it is color. So until I can find out about others I will not order anymore.
1,Crooners DVD from Amazon,Did not like this DVD. We like all of these singers but this DVD seemed like it was made 50 years ago.
5,Lots Of Chris Clark To Love On This CD !,"With 50 tracks you get a wonderful buy for the money in this great Chris Clark CD compilation.Has her two Motown albums Soul Sounds and CC Rides Again plus singles and unreleased songs too.I love this ! Her sound is a bit like Dusty Springfield.Particular favorites are Whisper You Love Me Boy,If You Let Me Baby,It Must Be Love Baby,Bad Seed,and a disco thumper Chris did called What You Doing.If you like Motown at all get this CD>"
1,Gack,"This book was awful. Gauche, poorly written and juvenile. The author had an interesting subject (Col. William B. Travis of Alamo fame), but for some reason wrote a book a third grader would have found silly. I recommend Trish Bennett's THE BETTER PART OF VALOUR for a story about this Texas gentleman who gave his life at the Alamo."
5,Amazon Book on prayers,"A good book and it afirms my thoughts on prayer. R.C. Sproul is really good. It is good source material. Much appreciated. I was really convinced Prayer changes things, but needed the words to pass on to unbelievers."
5,MSCL Rocks,"Dude, Like MSCL Rocks and it's so awesome that we can finally watch it on video (since it's oh so premature knock off the air *sob*) nevertheless, we must make due with what they give us and Reruns it shall be. Thanks for selling these awesome tapes."
3,i have seen better.,i think that the movis was good but on the other hand i have seen better and i think that they could of made the movie better then it was.
3,Disapointment,"I buy so many books and magazines, for myself and as gifts, and I thought that this might make a great gift for a scrapbooking-relative. I was disappointed. The ideas and pictures were beautiful; however, for this price, I believe I could have purchased MORE ideas and pictures (i.e. my money would have been better spent) if I had purchased a subscription to a scrapbooking magazine."
5,Great CD!!!!,"What a great CD! I started listening to Cravin' Melon in 2008, and can't stop! This is such a great album and is some of the best music I have ever heard....to top it off, they started playing shows again recently and I have seen them live twice in the past 2 months....maybe a new album is on the way, but either way this one is a keeper, you'll have a hard time turning it off!!"
2,You have to be close,Yes I checked all possible volume controls for the mic and still have to be close.I'm searching for a new one. possibly Logitech.
3,An inexpensive mic that gives you the basic function,"This mic is easy to start with and it gives you the most basic function - voice input for your computer. Yet it does not, as it claims, ""eliminate surrounding noice"": I tested its performance and there is much ""hoowwww"" sound after each input is received! But if you want an inexpensive mic, it is a choice."
2,A dismal failure,"Although this microphone does work, I have to be right next to it. (~6 inches away, tops) Low sensitivity. Buy another one."
1,Junk,You have to stick the microphone down your throat before it will recognize any sound. Unfortunately I threw away the box and receipt for this mic so it can't be returned.
2,Horrible,"Truly a piece of garbage. I was hoping for a new sleek black microphone to match my black PC motif, so I picked this up. This microphone does not pick up well at all. I tested it against the classic creative white microphone and not only does the creative pick up better, it makes you realize that the audio recorded by the cyber acoustics mic is of horrible quality. It sounds flat and robotic-like when compared to the old creative. What a waste of money."
1,What was that?,"So I bought this mic for $10 at Wal-Mart thinking it was like my friends mic which he just plugged in and can talk through. WRONG! Not in this world will you get quality products like you do from Logitech will you get from this company. I have to hold the mic closer than my headset mic in order for my friend to understand me. So yes, this product is a Desktop Microphone that you cant actually put on your desk to talk through (unless you lean over). The sound quality is horrible too. When I actually do pick up the microphone while I'm playing a game, I'm probably understandable 1/10 times. If you want a quality mic for $10 look else where. Biggest piece of junk ever. It's a headset microphone that you put on your desk. I guess I should just tape it to my head to get the same effect.GET THIS INSTEAD"
2,NEVER GO FOR SONY!!!,"SONY has one of the lousiest service. I had bitter experiences with my laptop bought for $1500. Poor quality. The hardware fails exactly after warranty and they squeeze customers with unreasonable component and service fees. They expect you to ship to San Diego, CA for service. They don't have service even in bayare. I would not recommend definitely from service view point."
1,Unreadable!,"The most appalling novel I've encountered.Absolutely aweful! Endless filth and violence.Can't say a single good thing about this book.Unreadable!I'm sorry Mr Delaney chose to write this ""work"".I chose not to finish reading it because it was so bad.Spend your time and money elsewhere."
2,childlike CAMP CRAP,"exxcruciating ssp induced lobotony induced LULL, NEARLY NONe done WONDEFULLY dicktion as dissertion SWALLow, WOG in the CLOD OF hog snarly tied SMARLY BARBED BARREL shooters gun FIRST PERSON DONE doom style done in WAD[WHITE AMAZON DELLUGE[ GOO GOO HOOVED GIVEN THE OLE HEAVE HO, HOGG wild PIG SLAUGHTER,perpendicular,FICTION ploted for gutter quarter for, camp pulpp naive naif , or plain NUTS TO beat meat, oh [ so ]SAMMY WHAMMY smarts,,"
5,Magnum Opus,"This is, without a doubt, Delaney's greatest sexual work. It is hard to say whether it surpasses Dhalgren, which is probably going to be remembered as his best and probably is, but Hogg, overall, is the purest expression of his exquisite sadean heart. If you likedThe 120 Days of Sodom, then you will love this!!!"
2,DEFINITELY NOT FOR THE READERS OF HIS FANTASY STORIES!,"This book goes far beyond anything I have ever read by Delany.It deals with the issue of pedophilia in a very graphic and disturbingway. Knowing that not everyone is aware of of the inclinations of theauthor, it might be fair to warn readers that unless they havea fairly strong stomache, they should pass this book by. It isn'tthat he deals with a new concept here, he has used this imagery beforein books like Equinox, and the Neveryon series, but that heconcentrates the whole of this book on it. I buy anything that I canfind by him, but would say this is only for that singular researchertrying to complete some project related to Delany's life. TRYSOMETHING ELSE!"
5,Aem brute force 06 titan,"Money well spent. Great product, definate horsepower and fuel mileage gains easy to install and sounds great im happy with my choice"
4,Best Bang For The Buck,"This Brute Force intake is the best bang for the buck, Amazon was the cheapest and quick ship.Installed this on an 06 Nissan Titan, fit great and looks awesome."
4,Keeping Vinyl alive,The Grado Black cartridge is a fine sounding cartridge with a musical clarity unmatched in the price range. To get noticably better sound would cost many times the asking price. My experience with Grado is that even their low end cartridges compare with their higher end fare. It makes it practical to keep fresh styli on your Vinyl.
2,I really wanted to enjoy it!,"I love Sara Paretsky's writing but this one has me stumped. Her characters, usually pretty well developed, are so one-dimensional that I didn't feel sympathy for any of them and that is the ""kiss of death"" for me as a reader. I want to cheer for someone or at least feel interested in their fate. With these folks I would have been unmoved if they'd all been chucked over a cliff. Plus there were more than a few that I wanted to slap around and and say, ""grow up!"" So, perhaps I do not understand what Paretsky was trying to accomplish, but for me the book was tedious and unsatisfying."
1,A truly awful book.,"Have always enjoyed V.I. and so went in expecting this book to be enjoyable and moderately well-done. I've rarely read anything so contrived, so full of characters that even a mother couldn't love (no wonder all the mothers died...) and so devoid of any redeeming qualities (like plot, depth, character development, etc.) Would definitely recommend giving this one a miss. Wait for the next Warshawski."
5,"Ghost Country is a fabulous, breath-taking book","I wasn't sure I would like a book by Sara Paretsky that wasn't about V I Warshawski, but Ghost Country is an absolutely wonderful novel. It deals with some of the toughest issues of our times, including the way in which religion is used as a cloak for mean-spirited of public policy making. The characters are so vivid and believable I was sorry to have to bid them good-bye. I especially liked the character Starr, who never speaks and acts as kind of a foil for the wishes and fears of the people around her. You can interpret her as a psychotic street person, or as a manifestation of the divine, depending on the biases you bring to the novel. I miss V I, but I hope Paretsky writes many more books as deep and challenging as this one."
1,"Well intentioned, but the writing skill just isn't there this time","I do commend Sara Paretsky for having attempted this, but alas, it seems that she has completely failed. The usual spark is completely missing, and so is credibility. I wish I could have liked this, because the theme is an important and vital one. But I found this to be quite laborious reading which just did not ring true. I do hope that this doesn't discourage her from trying again to show that she can tackle important social issues. And who knows. There are readers who enjoyed this and maybe time will prove those disappointed fans such as myself wrong. But I fear this wil just go down as a well-intentioned misfire on the author's part."
1,Is someone impersonating Sara Paretsky? It seems so.,"I obtained this book because of V.J. Warshawski, to whom reference is made on the book jacket. Imagine my disappointment when the first five pages were so totally dull, and the characters so completely deadly that I knew it would be a waste of time to get into the novel any further. Sara Paretsky may not want to be ""trapped"" in the Warshawski novels, but she does so extremely well in that genre! Ms. Paretsky has made the same mistake Robert Ludlum did when he tried to be funny in his two ""Road..."" books. This is a writer who definitely needs to stick with what she does so wonderfully."
3,Thought-provoking and riveting,"Having been told this book had bad reviews and is about the homeless, I was surprised at my reluctance to put it down. It raises challenging questions about the underlying truths in all of our lives. It tells a surface story about each of the characters, then an underlying narrative about their faith, value systems, morality. One story takes place at ""street level"", another ""underground, in dreams, fantasies"". It raises questions about the demons with which the author has wrestled and causes the reader to reflect on the inner challenges in his or her life. Reminds us that no one is all good or all bad, but we are all human and face life's struggles as best we can."
1,Ghost Country,"I was very disappointed with this book. I love the V.I. books and was ready to take on a new Paretsky book, but now I realize that it's best to stick with the familiar mysteries. This book promised to be challenging and for lack of a better adjective wonderful. I found that this book should be listed under horror and poorly written at that. Sara Paretsky should stick with what she is best at and that is the V.I. Mysteries."
1,Embarrassingly bad,"This novel has all of the weaknesses, but none of the strengths, of the VI novels.Cardboard characters, wooden dialogue, earnest ""social problem"" moralizing, reductive psychologizing...all of this and more can be found in the VI series. But the VI novels _do_ also offer more: an endearingly imperfect protagonist, a cast of quirky sidekicks, and a fast-paced (if sometimes highly improbable) plot. They're formulaic but fun._Ghost Country_ is formulaic, but it's not at all fun. I can't remember when I've read a more tedious book. And I can't remember when I last read something that made me feel such embarrassment for the author. I kept wanting to abandon it, but just couldn't stop myself from turning the next page to see just how bad things could get. Things got pretty bad, and then got worse.Reading this book from start to finish was like stopping to watch a traffic accident: you know you should look away, but you can't resist craning your neck to take a peek."
2,WHAT WAS SHE THINKING?,"This was something totally unexpected. I am not sure where Sara was going with this book and was really disappointed. I did not associate with the characters and it was hard to get into the book. I have read all of Sara's previous books and enjoyed them thoroughly, I hope she will continue to write mysteries in the future, if not I would think twice about buying another of her books."
3,Looking for another detective/mystery? This isn't it.,"Looking for a novel that puts you into the lives of several some homeless women and the lives of people who are somehow touched by them? This is a good one. I loved parts of the novel, mainly, the way Paretsky weaves ""miracles"" into the plot, much like a truly American version of The Milagro Beanfield War or Like Water for Chocolate. I found the book hard to put down, mostly because I wanted to know WHY the characters were acting/thinking the way they were. I wanted to know what was behind the doctor's obsession or the church people's fear. I was disappointed in this area, as Paretsky seemed to fall short in developing a couple of characters. I also missed the wonderful descriptions of Chicago that I got in the V.I. novels."
2,This is one strange book.,"Although this book is sympathetic to women, poor and homeless people and critical of anti-women, patriarchal church leaders, showing what they're really all about, it's a weird book. Paretsky makes some very good points showing a lot of the contradictions in today's society, the problems of the homeless and of poor women and the lack of decent shelters, funding, decent health care and mental health care--but the points are almost lost in the strange story and weird religious allegories. The reader gets bogged down in all of this while Paretsky is making good points about society today and the need for solutions to these very real social problems."
1,Nauseating,"I found this title extremely disappointing. My expectations were obviously too high. A really weird offering from Paretsky. I truly felt sick to my stomach after reading this book - unsure if it's a touch of flu or the content of this ""offering."" I'm glad I borrowed the book from my library and didn't buy it; I'd feel ripped off."
2,"A stretch, but not a successful one","It's hard not to be disappointed when one of your favorite authors aims for the sky and misses utterly. This attempt at magical realism is so badly conceived that I wonder what Paretsky could have been thinking. The magical elements hit us over the head, rather than hinting at an alternate reality.The characters were all unlikeable and the main character, a ghostly re-incarnation of a Sumerian goddess, was absolutely grotesque. I found myself almost rooting for the fundamentalist church people who have evil designs on the goddess.Not that I wish Paretsky stay pigeonholed in the mystery genre, but I wish she'd get back to doing what she does so well--created well-paced mysteries with moxie and heart."
4,The theory of moldable stone and high technology.,"A unique book. It gives a fine perspective and opens some doors towards thought that have been previously closed. I think that this book is no longer being published, but it is a MUST HAVE for anyone interested in the mysteries of the pyramid and the construction techniques. He opens up some areas of thought that are nothing short of pure inspiration. Not for your casual pyramid reader. But if you are interested in some in depth theory and examples, this book has it all."
5,It really is concrete,"I had been taught that 100,000 slaves pulled rocks by rope across the vast desert to build the pyramids. It seemed reasonable to a grade schooler. Dr. Davidowits makes a compelling, indeed conclusive, case that the ancients knew more about concrete than we do today. Rather than quarry and pull massive stones that would have been shaped with brass tools, they simply built forms and poured in a mixture that hardened into rock. The precision of the joinery could not have been done with modern tools much less the brass tools of the day. The knowledge of concrete chemistry has apparently been lost over time."
1,Not convincing,"While the books premise is interesting and creative, I did not come away with the feeling that the authors had proved their point. Too many questions were left unanswered, such as why are broken fossils are found along the edges of the pyramid blocks. Entertaining, but too far outside of mainstream science to be believable."
3,"thin, one of two books in English","Well illustrated, overview, but ""not much meat on the bones"", I would only recommend you buy it since it is one of the only two books I know of in English on the topic.If you wish a Very Scholarly treatment read ""The Teeth and Claws of the Buddha: Monastic Warriors and Sohei in Japanese History"" by Mikael S. Adolphson. Very dense, extensively footnoted. Apparently the very word 'sohei' wasn't coined until the 1600s, and most modern writing is based on that 17th & 18th century perspective (bias) rather than looking back carefully at the actual periods of greatest activity (AD ~900- ~1600). Adolphson talks extensively about the biases of these Japanese historians (and contemporary Japanese historians)"
4,Even the priests of Japan were warriors,"I had known, in a vague way, about the warrior-monks of Japan, but this is the first book I'd ever seen that concentrated on them. Had things gone just a little differently in a few battles, it could have been them, rather than the samurai, who effectively ruled Japan, with unknowable consequences. Many of these ""monks"" were as fierce, brave and stark warriors as any samurai; in fact, many samurai joined the warrior-monks' monasteries."
4,japanese warrior monks,good overview of the subject. goes well with other books in their series on Japan.
1,DO NOT BUY - Complete rip off of 'Stage',"The tracks on this album are the exact same tracks as those on 'Stage' minus 2 songs. The 1st 6 tracks of 'Stage' were recorded at The House Of Blues in Los Angeles, CA. The last 6 tracks of 'Stage' were recorded at The Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim, CA. For some strange reason, the tracks on 'Extended Versions' alternates between the 2 shows, I can only guess in an attempt to keep the listener from recognizing the order of the songs from 'Stage.' This CD is a rip off. Don't buy it! Buy 'Stage.' You will be much happier with 'Stage.'"
3,Where is the text?,"Unlike the other guy's problem, where he got Vol. 1 (with the text) only, I got Volume 2 only (just the examples). What's that all about?"
4,Swimmers have a different use for swim caps,"Actually, the purpose of a swim cap is to keep hair out of the face, and keep the body aerodynamic in the water, NOT keep hair dry. If you want one to protect your hair, the hair care aisle of yourr local drug store has those- they come with straps and flowers and everything.Swim caps like this are not meant for a leisure swimmer- in fact, most swimmers WET their hair before putting on silicone or lycra caps to get them to stay put. For those of us who swim in warm water and/or climates, traditional swim caps are way too warm. If you swim competitively, you need to keep cool, and silicone and latex don't exactly offer that.These are great caps- much nicer fitting than the TYR ones (which are tall and narrow, suitable for the coneheads among us, I suppose). They do wear out VERY quickly, both in salt and chlorinated water. But for the distance swimmer, they do their job nicely without causing headaches or being too loose."
1,lycra cap,I had no idea lycra was not waterproof. I kind of thought a speedo swim cap was made to keep your hair dry. I guess it's for reducing friction--or keeping your hair out of your eyes or the pool filter because I would have been better (and cheaper) off just pulling a nylon stocking over my head. I didn't return it because it was not really advertised as waterproof. My mistake.
1,Cannot even perform a basic function!,"I thought the purpose of a swim cap was to keep one's hair dry. So why would you make a cap out of material that is permeable to water?! I used this cap and after I was done swimming, my hair was just as wet as it would have been without one. Also, the package says that it is specially designed for long hair, but I had a very hard time getting all my hair under the cap, and after I did the cap squeezed my head somewhat. Get a spandex cap, not this useless one!"
1,Great idea gone very bad!,"First of all I LOVE how comfortable it is. Doesn't feel like it's squeezing your head like a normal silicone cap would. HOWEVER, two problems. The banded seam around the edge leaves a lovely indentation around my forehead. The cap also holds water so by the time I'm at the end of the lane, I have this lovely water bubble inside the cap. I have to open the cap away from my head to let the water bubble drain out so I can hear again. Thumbs down. Guess I'm going back to the old silicone cap."
1,"Too small, too tight","I swim 2000 yds a day, my head circumference is 22.5 inches, and this cap is much too tight. Hoping it would loosen up, I've tried it for a couple of months but it's still tight to the point of being uncomfortable. The marks from the cap on my forehead show up for hours after swimming.I like the idea of lycra over latex or silicone but have not been able to find a lycra cap that works for me - and this one certainly isn't it."
3,Not for curly hair,Doesn't fit on medium length thick curly hair. It's pretty uncomfortable but it's great quality.
2,too small for it's purpose,"Basic lycra cap - not designed to keep hair dry (people: read the description!), just out of the way. Made well, brand name so I expected that. But my small womanly head with hair just to my nape, this cap can hardly cover my head, much less the hair. I am hoping that when it is wet in the pool, it will work. My Amazon-purchased TYR lycra cap fits much better, seems larger and a better shape. And never again will I use a silicon swim cap - too tight, pulls the hair."
4,swim caps,"I started water sumba dance lessons at the local ymca and needed a swim cap. I did not want the thick and heavy caps so I ordered the speedo lycra cap in purple. It was just the right fit for my head and so liking it a lot I ordered a second cap, this time in white. It serves the purpose, it matches the color scheme of my suit. I like it a lot."
4,comfortable and easy on/off,I prefer this type of material in a swim cap. Easier to get on and off and it is very comfortable.
4,Fine Collection,"I have made a number of dips from this book, and I'm always satisfied. The recipes are easy to follow, and the dips seem to always receive rave reviews. The dips are basic enough, but also usually have a unique twist that satifies. If you need to make a dip, then you should pick up this little gem of a book!"
3,Too Far Out,"I was not real impressed with this cookbook, a little too far out for my taste. I think I wanted something more basic. There are some dips that I'll probably make and some I might be willing to try. The book has a pretty good section on dippers. I think there should have been a section for salads as some of the recipes reminded me more of a salad. If I had looked through this book before buying, even at the bargain I got on it, I would have passed this one up."
5,Nothing like it,This is a great disc. There is nothing like it in the music world. And remember to listen to the words.
3,An Album Built on Clay,"If you are looking for something different,original and deeply moving, then I'd advise you to look elsewhere. This album is for Clay Walker fans only. The songs are all ones that have been done by everybody and their dog a million times before...and done better.Clay has made the big mistake of trying to play it safe with the 'old favourites'. Even so, it could have been an agreeable album if he hadn't made mistake number two...using orchestral backing. Simple country style backing music is much more Clay Walker's style.My advice? if you're a Clay Walker fanatic then buy it. Otherwise there are much better Christmas albums to spend your money on."
2,"Some work, some don't",I've done my best with these bags and sealed and re-sealed. Some stay airtight and some leak air back into the bag no matter what you do. I'd recommend pretending that you're buying only half as many bags and be happy with what you get.Disappointing.
1,Junk - don't bother,"they don't hold the vacuum, at the best in a couple days it's all expanded back to ""normal"", just use giant Zip Lock bags."
2,Disappointed packer...,"Does not reduce content size all that much, not enough for me to spend near fifty bucks for plastic bags. The largest sizes are really huge. If only they worked as advertised you could really pack several comforters, etc., into one bag. I was in the midst of a relocate and busy pulling my hair out or I would have returned this item.In short, I recommend you pass on this one; I was not at all pleased."
3,Space Bag 15 Bag Set,I have 3 of my bags which will not stay flat. There is holes and it is sealed tight but yet it still inflates itself. Thanks anyway.
3,Get ready to iron!,"I purchased several of these bags from the manufacturer and with the help of my son, we finally got them to seal properly and I stored my winter clothes in them. When it came time to unload the space bags, about 6 months later, they did not just ""fluff out"" like shown on TV. Even though everything had been put in there folded neatly, most things had to be ironed, air dried, and in some cases washed and dried before I could wear them. They were terribly wrinkled! I even had a brand new winter coat with the tags on that was so wrinkled I had to take it to the cleaners to get it dry cleaned before I could even wear it. The bags will save space and keep a tight seal but they are probably more suited for short term storage than for a full season. Next year I'll put all my clothes away dirty and unfolded and then just wash them when I take them out of the bags!"
1,half of them don't work,"half of the batch don't work, one day after I tried it, some of them after 10 minutes, back to pre-vacuumed state. I bought them, received them directly from the spacebag.com in many varieties and sizes. both hanging styles don't work, cheap material, do not waste your money"
1,don't waste your money,"I bought a box of a half-dozen or so of these a few years ago. Now I have none because none of them would stay sealed for very long. I zipped them shut, back and forth a couple of times to make sure they were sealed, rolled them up to squish out the air and they looked great. A few hours later, they were pretty much decompressed. I have ended up throwing all of them away over the years I've owned them because they just do not stay sealed. They suck. Save your money. I should have looked at the Amazon reviews before I bought them at my local store."
1,LoveGoodDeals,"These bags are worthless.When I got them, took them out of the packaging and put some clothes in them. Got the vacuum and drew the air out. An hour later, bags are full of air again.We tried several times to get these to work. Making sure they weren't overfilled, that the Ziploc type seal was properly closed, etc., etc.Don't waste your money. Someone wrote that the travel bags that you roll up to get the air out are heavy plastic, so maybe they work. But the regular vacuum type bags are expensive garbage bags."
1,Glorified Ziploc bag,This product is no better than an ordinary Ziploc bag. The plastic is cheap and tears easily. Even with the bag perfectly sealed it let air in in less than a week. I guess I will stick with trash bags because they work better and are cheaper. Don't waste your money on this product.
1,lost air,I put some blankets in one of the jumbo bags and within HOURS some of the air was back into the bag. The plastic material these are made out of is much too thin.Really disappointed - love the idea and wish I could find a brand that actually does what it promises
1,Very disappointed,"As many of the other reviewers said, these bags do not keep the air out. I zipped and zipped to make sure the seal was tight. I made sure the valve was 'locked' and pushed in (that's what the customer service dept at Spacebags said to do). Unfortunately in a couple weeks, all the bags (I have 15 of them) filled with air. It was a waste of money!"
1,space waste,"Garbage. Because of the bad reviews, we opted to buy local so we could return if needed. At first, it appeared that one out of three in both boxes we bought would work. So, we strategically bought another box of three, figuring we would have 1 set of working bags and 2 to return for a refund. After one month, all three of the bags that initially worked have lost their vacuum. I may as well have used left over walmart bags for storage instead.Space Bag 15 Bag SetITW Space Bag BRS-6239 Storage Bag Combo Pack: 3 Pack - 1 Medium Size, 1 Large Size and 1 Extra Large Size Bag"
5,Others must not be using them correctly.,I bought a multi pack of space bags and they work GREAT! I am going to order some more actually. I use them for spare bedding and pillows as well as seasonal clothes. I want to order more to use for throw blankets during the summer and some travel sizes for my annual vacations. They even have new storage totes that I may try as well. You just have to know how to use them correctly.
1,LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS...,"I wish I would have listened to the reviews. I moved and packed my clothing in these space savers. I got to my destination a day later and half of the bags, all filled properly and with clothing, had refilled with air. A week later, and the remainder of the bags had also filled with air. A waste of money, but my move is over."
3,Ok,This product works really well but one of my bags were ripped when I got it and I didn't feel like going throught the hassle of returning it. But I would recommend it to others.
2,eh,"The smaller bags work fine, but the extra-large bags are horrible. Every XL bag in the set was perforated. The bags are made out of such thin plastic that putting anything in the larger bags doesn't work well. I was expecting them to be made out of thicker, more flexible plastic. I might recommend getting the smaller ones, but would not recommend the variety set. If you want bigger bags, just get the ziploc jumbo bags and sit on them to push the air out. They're extremely sturdy in comparison, and even have carrying handles."
1,Do not Buy,"Do not waste your money on this product!! Although the concept is ideal, the bags refill with air shortly after the suctioning, thus making them useless. I have had more permanent results squeezing air out of a garbage bag and tying it shut."
1,Wish I had read the reviews before buying these!,"I'm usually a smart shopper, but this time I didn't do enough research. I didn't read the reviews on this site - which would have stopped me from throwing away a bunch of money on these worthless bags. They are very cheaply made - though not priced that way. I bought 4 sets with 8 bags each. I have attempted to use about 10 of them. The air sucks out fine and whatever is in there becomes a compact brick. But just as the other reviews stated, within a period of time - sometimes 15 minutes, sometimes several days - every single one of them took on some air. Lighter objects, like pillows, seemed to work best - perhaps because they offered the least amount of resistance. Very, very disappointing. Not worth it at all. You'd be better off creating your own from garbage bags!"
2,"OM, the worst ziploc I've ever seen!","The valve is very cool... the bag is thin, and the ziplock is horrid. They really need to re-do this and make it from vinyl or something. The first one I used worked well (but I am afraid one of the cats might chomp on the corner). The second one, apparently the blue ""zip"" clip was misaligned and sawed right through the bag!!! I didn't expect to be having to use duct tape the first time I used these. I'm still not sure if my duct tape will hold... doing a test now. If you have these - DONT use the zip clip - if it's not lined up just right it will tear the chinsy plastic. I wish I hadn't sat them on a shelf so long that I can't return them... :(Now, if I could figure out how to re-use the valves..."
1,Horrible! Horrible bags !,"Don't waste your money!!! These bags are worthless!! None of them work, no matter the size, those with the zipper are the worst. The travel ones ended up crowding my luggage I never managed to get them to stay flat for more than 5 minutes inside my suitcase.I believed the 5 stars rating people and thought I was doing something wrong, but trust me, the product is just not what it claims to be, point blank!! I had bought a bunch of them, at the end of the day they were just cluttering my house for no reason. I ended up throwing them away after trying all kinds of methods for months to get them to work. What a ripp off!Keep your money in your pocket!!"
2,"Some work, some don't","...simple as that...I think they are cheap because they are made cheap...the idea is brilliant and it would be great if they were made better...the zip lock is exactly the same you will find on a sandwich bag also if you don't pull the zip closed just right so, the edge rips and the whole bag is wasted....but I am happy with the ones that did work....I do not regret buying them, but I will not be buying any more....do I recommend?.....mmmmmm, if there is no other better-made ones - yes, but if there are better ones -no"
1,"Some hold the seal, some don't.","I have called customer service and received tips on how to make sure these bags hold their seals. You push down on the valve before closing it, making sure you also don't overfill them. It's so frustrating because some work, some don't. I always try to refill and seal the bad bags, but the same thing happens. I had SPACE BAG send me replacements thinking maybe they were faulty bags, same thing with the new bags, and it took me months to get new bags sent. I had to stay on top of them to even get the replacements. I also am surprised they are still in business, it's such a great concept but they need to take them back to development."
1,1 star is for the concept only,"All the negative reviews seem consistent with what the problems I've been having over the last few years of not giving up these darn things. It sounds like such a great concept but it's not perfected yet.As expensive as these things are I would hope the ziplock feature would be better than what it is. The blue slider constantly pops off - even in mid zip. Within a few hours ALL BAGS are reinflated. I have about 7 of them. I wasted about 4 or 5 when they tore. I was working on my bed with blankets, how could it tear!? I did not overfill. Don't waste your money on this."
4,Maybe I got lucky but they worked for me.,"I bought a set of the Space Bag storage packs from a Wal-Mart several months ago to try them out -- decided to use them for blankets & sheets. The bag didn't compress as much as I thought it would, but it does save space, which is what I need. I had no problems with sealing the bag - the closer did fall off the edge of one of the bags, but it was easy to put it back on & seal the bag. I was planning on buying some more, this time online & in my quest I stumbled upon this site. . . and the reviews - wow! After reading them, I went to check the status mine - much to my relief, they are as flat as they were when I put them in the closet. I only bought a 3 pack set, and so far all is well. I am leery about purchasing more now after reading the others' reviews, but I probably will since the ones I bought are still sealed, compressed, and they did save me storage space."
3,Now I'm confused...,"Recently, I bought the large and jumbo space bags from Wal-Mart. I was like a kid in a candy store. I'm moving, but I can't afford a rental truck, so I have to cram my one-bedroom apartment in two cars. I decided to give these things a try. I put the stuff in....seal, and presto, a thin brick-like bundle all safe and secure. I was SOOOOO excited about this, so I just spent like $80 on more space bags from the manufacturer. Of course, then I've read these reviews. I am REALLY nervous now about what I can expect from the next shipment. The only problem I've had so far is the zipper thingie. It does have a tendency to come off, but in the three to four weeks that I've had my other stuff sealed, they haven't expanded or sprung a leak. I just hope I can be lucky again..."
4,Space bag Review,I have used the bags in the past and found them to be very useful. The only thing that they could improve on is the travel bags. They should make them in assorted sizes for travel.
1,Space Bags don't work,"I've read another review on this site and completely agree, this item would be great if it actually worked. The problem is, it doesn't, at all. It tricks you into thinking how great it is because initially it does flatten out to an amazingly small fraction of it's original stuffed size, but within several minutes to several hours, it reinflates not saving any space at all.When the first set I purchased had these issues, I contacted customer service and was told to be sure that I didn't over stuff (which I hadn't) and that I could have a defective gasket. I then saw a set at BBB which said ""improved."" I bought it and had the exact same issue. In addition, any of the previous ones I tried to reuse, now had tears and holes from being stored. I ended up with a total of 9 space bags, NONE of which work as advertised.Again, this is a great idea but these things just don't work. Don't waste your $."
1,Over priced plastic - not even functional,"These are the most over priced piece of plastic EVER! Air immediately started refilling with air and promptly ripped. They don't get much smaller than if you manually push clothes or such into a small space. HUGE waste of money, don't bother."
5,hot with bubber and tricky sam,"This cd is soooo good! I'm writing this to let you know that the great Bubber Miley plays on tracks 1-8, from 1923. Charlie Irvis plays tb on #14, from 1926. And as if that's not enough, Joe ""Tricky Sam"" Nanton plays tb on tracks 15-21, from 1926! Wow."
4,rare speed/thrash jewel,"Extremely underrated extraordinary belgium thrash/speed metal band. Great compilation of tracks plenty of frantic riffs. Check out ""Civilized genocide"" and ""Clowns"". Production is not that good, but definetely, this album is a mandatory piece for late eigthies-early nighties-thrash/speed metal collectors"
4,"Good, old school book","It's a great book written in the days where the violence and imposing nature of the mob was much greater than it is today. Whille I wouldn't say it was the mob's hey day, it would be disingenuous to say it wasn't close. People who wrote about the mob or went after tham were risking their own lives...The book is an account about Joey Gallo's crew, who was one of the most unstable and dangerous of the time. It gives a great example of the human nature of the mob, not romanticized, sugar-coated, or broken down into any number of other, more basic stereotypes. As such, it can be more difficult to read. ""The Greek"" sometimes rambles and at several points I was openly repulsed by what I read. It wasn't vulgar, but violent and degrading.Either way, for people interested about the mafia - a GREAT read! Worth the effort to find it..."
3,an ok read if you have nothing else to read,"I picked up this book thinking that I was about to read avery intruiging book about the world of organized crime, but this book really bored me. If these events really did happen, they should have been told in the book with more ""uumph."" Thats ususally how stories about the Mafia, the Mob,And so forth Become bestsellers and eventually blockbuster movies."
5,"""Ironman"" style micro! Get these gems while they still exist!","After going through 2 used micros purchased at a game store, I returned both because I had to get a new one. Good thing I found this japanese Famicom edition that looks gold and red like ironman's suit.The tiny screen is very sharp and bright. Might have a few problems in bright sunlight, but indoors at full light, it is fantastic. The game processor is fast as well, playing streetfighter 3 alpha at full speed with no problems.Portability due to size and battery life is astonishing.Good for the grown up waiting out an auto repair.Most people don't know this exists, but when they see mine, they are befuddle as to why they've never heard of it. Faceplates and other accessories are impossible to find now, and the few that exist are here on amazon.Most games can be bought used at g@mest0p for $3-$10, with the exception of anything that says Mario on it which is around $20."
4,Hot Game!!,I got this as a gift for my son in Christmas '07.I loved playing it too. I just had to purchase a new one when a friend lost it last month :(
2,Over priced,"PROs:1. Foam holds items tightly and secure2. Scissors are very sharp3. Shipping from this seller was amazingly fastCONs:1. Casing made of plastic(feels like it could easily break)2. Nail clipper breaks nails rather than cut3. Tweezers have no grip for pulling(the part that pinches is smooth)I don't think this item is worth more than $2, definitely not for me as the main reason I wanted this set was for the nail clippers which are horrible and literally breaks the nail leaving it rough and splintered."
4,Fugazi keeps getting better & better!,"This is a great album! In my opinion, it contains some of the best stuff Fugazi has ever written! I would reccomend this album to anyone who's already a fan of Fugazi and to anyone who's looking for something totally different than the norm."
3,"Pretty good, but it doesn't stay in the head for long","""Argument"" shows a more subtle side of Fugazi, but they uncomfortably straddle the divide between hitting hard and being catchy. It's not loud enough for its level of catchiness, in other words. It would have been better if Fugazi had gone all the way and strengthened the hooks in each song. The first three songs are about evenly strong then ""Life and Limb"" sticks out with its guitar picking. The album slows until ""Oh"" and the two following pick it up. The title track is a quieter song to finish it all."
3,sorry,"let me start by saying that i've been a fan a fugazi for a long time, but i think it might be time for retirement. I might regret this because I've only listned to the album a few times and it might just need to grow on me but this album seems to lack any freshness. Before you could always count on fugazi to move in some interesting way with each album. ""The Argument"", however, just sounds like ""End Hits"" with female back-up vocals on one or two tracks. I find the album simply boring, maybe it is just me, maybe i'm getting too old, but then again maybe they are getting too old. I'm still giving the album 3 stars because even bad fugazi is still better than half the stuff out there but it is definitely not up to the standard they've set in the past."
2,Easily fugazi's worst.,"I forgot how bad this album was until I popped it into my CD player the other day.It seems like every song has one or two parts that are totally killer, followed by 3-4 minutes of boredom. The song ""Epic Problem"" is good throughout, and Full Disclosure is EXCELLENT except for the horrible screamed verses. Strangelight is awesome too, and not very typical of Fugazi. The Kill is also good in the same way, it's very chilled out. Past these few standout tracks(which wouldn't be standouts at all on any other album of theirs) there isn't much reason to listen to the album. It's incredibly boring.I suggest picking up any other fugazi album first, maybe 13 songs, red medicine or in on the kill taker."
1,D-,"this is as close to failure as it can get.. i'm an old school Fugazzi fan, and this album has nothing to do with their stuff from way back when.. sorry guys, not there no more...."
1,Shoot me,"I don't know what album the rest of the reviewers were listening to. Maybe I expect too much from the band that wrote ""13 Songs"" but I found this album to be very droning and lacking in musical energy and creativity. I may as well have been listening to Radiohead."
4,Fugazi Madness,"Once again the boys from Fugazi have come back with a great record. Consistancy and innovation are always present when Fugazi goes to work. With the state of music in flux a truly great American band still puts out quality, hard hitting music!"
3,Much respect,"I fully respect Fugazi for moving forward musically, but this one was not my cup of tea. I liked all of Red Medicine, about then about half of End Hits.Repeater was always my favorite."
5,Fugazi's great statement,"This completely exceeds my expectations for the always mind-blowing Fugazi. The band seems to have streamlined its angular, jagged sound, while making it sound effortless. Highlights include ""Full Disclosure"" ""Strangelight"" and the jaw-dropping ""Ex-Spectator"". The accompanying ""Furniture"" EP is just as killer."
3,review of DCRUIL,I liked this book because I am interested in civil rights and like rage against the machine. Basically it gives graphic details about previous civil resistance>>>The native american stand off at wounded knee & it also gives info on what you can do to resist the hands of international law.
2,Skin Sensitives? Beware!,"We tried Tide ""Free"" because I have sensitive skin. A friend of mine, also with skin sensitivities, tried it too. I used the formula for regular machines, and she has the HE machine. We both found that this product causes a great deal of itching when we use it.I hate to think what's in this ""free"" product that isn't in regular Tide, as I don't have a problem with it. I thought I'd be doing a good thing to get this product, as I'm trying to expose my kids to fewer chemicals. Unfortunately, I was wrong. We'll be sticking to Dreft (yes, I know it's the same company) with its different formula. It has a pleasant scent, cleans well, and is not irritating even with the light perfume it contains.The only good thing I can say is that this product is good at cleaning. But you can spend less money getting regular Tide with the same or better results.~Christina from Wantz Upon a Time Book Reviews (who also happens to be a SAHM)"
2,The Worst Tide Product I have tried,"The thing that grabbed my attention was the great price for four bottles of Tide. It does not clean my clothes as good as the normal Tide products. I was very disappointed and will never buy the variety of Tide again. If you need dye and fragrance free detergent, expect to wash the clothes at least twice with this variety of Tide."
2,great for people who love scentless detergent,"Like others who reviewed this, I purchase 4 bottles of Tide scentless detergent because of subscribe and save discount. Nevertheless, I should have bought this detergent first at grocery store (Safeway carries it - I live in California), to make sure I really like this detergent before I purchase 4 bottles. Truth is, it cleans great, no complaint about it. But, for those people who love clothes that come out from drier smell really good, you have to add fabric softener, otherwise, the clothes will smell scentless, just like what it says on the label.I like to have my clothes coming out from the drier smelling good, not scentless. Point number two: because of this scentless feature, if you don't add fabric softener, some socks, underpants are still smelly. TMI, i know, but I tell the truth and only the truth.So, you got what you paid for with this Tide."
2,doesn't get stains out!,"Need advice on getting stains out with HE machine. Bought 1 based on CR recommendations- it was rated very good, plus has anti-vibration for 2nd floor (that part works). Does not remove stains. Is it the detergent? Used All HE, THAT WAS ACTUALLY BETTER than this TIDE 2X HE. This stuff didn't even get basic pizza stains out (in hot water) which had been pretreated with shout. Nothing has worked on a strawberry stain yet. I never had this problem with my (dead) top loader. help! Have 2 messy (2& 4) boys, cannot be throwing out all their clothes because nothing will clean them! Consumer reports, this is not acceptable! Be more rigorous/ true to life with your testing!"
4,My favorite Tide,"This is my favorite Tide detergent. I really dislike heavily fragranced laundry detergents and also do not quite see the benefit of dye in such a product. Tide Free and Gentle HE is my every-day detergent and it does the job just as well as the other Tide products - without the annoying ""perfume"". I was very happy to find it here on Amazon because regular grocery stores often don't even carry the regular HE detergents, let alone the Free and Gentle version."
1,Not Gentle enough for those with sensitive skin,"After reading a positive review of the tested cleaning power of Tide products, I decided to give the ""Free and Gentle"" product a try. This was after many successful years of using the ""Free and Clear"" versions of ""All"" and ""Purex"" brands.A history of sensitive skin drove me to this type of product. Upon first wearing of clothing laundered in ""Tide Free and Gentle"", I developed red, raised blotches wherever there was contact with my skin. I ran out to the store immediately to purchase ""All Free and Clear"" and started re-washing everything previously laundered with Tide."
2,smells horrible,I've tried the bounce-free sheets and those smell like a box of crayons and now the Tide-he Perfume free stinks like chemicals. I think it is just best to use the scented products and do an extra rinse cycle. Scent -free products smell more like chemicals and the clothes stink.
3,cleans great but.....,This product is ok. It cleans great but it made me itch. I probably have more sensitive skin and a nose than most people so I'm sure it is a wonderful product for most people to use.
5,Only Available from Toys R Us Employees or Ebay,"This is a great simpsons product, only one problem...they were never placed on the retail shelves. The only way to get them was to pay a toys r us employee to get it from their hidden stash in the back stock room. I refused to buy one from the teenager TRU employee who was trying to sell them at $50 a set, now I have to pay $60 plus $10 shipping to get it off of Ebay. Note to Toys R Us, if you have an exclusive, please properly supervise your employees to ensure all the sets make it to the retail floor."
3,Family Xmas,"Overall - ***This is a great set, particularly for folks that didn't get a Lisa, or Marge and Maggie in the living room set. Since it is so Christmas themed, some folks may not want to display it with the rest of their sets all year round, but I think it looks great no matter what the season."
1,Typical hatchet job by Feinstein,"Another hatchet job by Feinstein on a prominent African-American athlete (see his ridiculous crusade against John Thompson). Compare his take on Tiger Woods to his ""A Good Walk Spoiled"" where he practically worships all of the other (read: white) golfers on the PGA Tour, all of whom are as flawed as Tiger Woods."
1,Horrible,"It should be obvious to anyone who has read Feinstein's articles and books on Tiger that he has an axe to grind. If you are looking for a fair and unbaised read on Tiger Woods - avoid this at all costs.To the reviewer below who regarded Tiger's success as hype -- the man has 12 majors as of 2006, 2nd only to the Golden Bear and I THINK Tiger has a few more years of good golf left. If you think that is HYPE you must not think much of the other golfing greats like Palmer, Hogan, Player... I could go on... but I think Tiger is saying it better than I ever could."
2,Feinstein has it in for Tiger,"i am a big John Feinstein fan....loved all his book on basketball and his earlier works of non-fiction on golf.....unfortunately he has either a real blind spot or severely negative bent towards Tiger and spends his time in this short space bashing him with sarcastic comments and criticism.....does tiger deserve criticism, absolutely. but Feinstein goes after him so harshly and constantly that you feel that Tiger is the victim, tough to do all things considered."
2,"A strange filter, this one.","I submit Feinstein would be better served to consider Woods' family dynamics, rather than skewer them. And no, you can not consider them by skewering them."
4,Like a good golf course: Tough but fair,"Typical Feinstein: sharp, always interesting, lean, fast-moving prose, a bit ham-fisted and over-simplistic at times, but always rewarding. He's not at all easy on ""Team Tiger"" here, strongly pushing the point that we want to like Tiger, and don't need the spin control. Golf is an odd sport where the underdog isn't always cheered, or allowed to be an underdog for long. Tiger Woods is, unfortunately, another symbol of how money can ruin sports. But, by the same token, this book - no matter how well done (and it is) - is the very definition of backlash. - F. Harris"
2,NOT SUCH A MEMORABLE DAY,"MEMORIAL DAY is one of Jeff Speakman's later movies. Speakman looks a little out of shape and doesn't have much heart in his performance as Ed Downey, a former agent of The Agency, who has been placed in a mental institution because he knew about the Eagle satellite and it's laser shooting death ray. Of course, now the Agency has him back, programmed to help in the assassination of presidential candidate Frederick Coffin. Bruce Weitz plays Speakman's former mentor whose involvement in the conspiracy is predictable. Stephanie Niznik (Looking a lot like Falcon Crest's Susan Sullivan) is the dedicated t.v. reporter who wants to crack the story. Veteran actor Paul Mantee plays the corrupted general.All in all, a derivative and not too exciting offering from the usually more interesting Speakman movies."
3,"Great chips, poor packaging","These chips taste great, especially since they're baked. The packaging leaves a lot to be desired. The box had been crushed and had a huge amoount of tape on it to hold it together. Needs to be put inside another box for shipping. Chips are all broken up."
3,"Decent design, flawed sound","The foam pads are relatively comfortable and the behind the ear design works well enough, but prominent distortion even at low volumes makes these largely unsuitable for music listening. They're good enough for PC gaming, but not much more. I'm not an audiophile with exacting standards, but I'm still searching for a moderately priced headset microphone with acceptable sound."
3,A good study of statistics.,"I am not sure I would call it delightful, but an easy-to-read, comprehensive study of the field."
4,Great gunlocks,Great gun locks. They work better on some guns then others. You sometimes need to mess around with them for a while to find the sweet spot. The key sometimes sticks in the key hole. The great thing is that with one key you can open all 3.
4,Met my expectation but...,The Locks fit just fine however they only came with 2 keys and when I ordered it I thought based on the pictures they would come with 4 keys.
4,Well Worth The Cost,"I use these on all of my guns, along with cable locks through the chamber and a gun safe. Redundancy can't hurt under the circumstances.They have a secure fit and don't scratch the trigger or trigger guard.If Plaxico Burress used one of these on his Glock, he might have one, maybe two, more Super Bowl rings."
4,Don't loose the key,"I have had a master lock trigger lock like this for years and have never had a problem with it. It fits reasonably well on my revolver without any modifications. I am not sure what the other reviewer is referring to about a button unlock but there are one or two yellow buttons on the inside, the part that grips the trigger guard. If you lock this thing on your gun and loose the key you better hope the locksmith will work on it or you are going to damage your gun trying to take it off. If you use this trigger lock as designed it should not harm your gun nor should you have any problems with it keeping your guns secure from acidental discharge. No lock is perfect; this one does keep the gun reasably ""safe."""
3,lock works,The only thing I didn't like is when the trigger is locked it won't fit in my hard gun case.
4,Good safety devices,I always worry about older kids playing with the guns when I am gone but this locks them up and makes them non functional. The guns are also secured in a cabinet.
2,Good lock.,These locks are decent for what I need them for. It secures the trigger like it supposed to but the spring loaded nubs that surround the center locking mechanism is cheap and can fall out where the function of those are questionable in preventing the lock from shifting that the trigger of the gun may be freed while still on the gun? May want to look into another alternative.
4,Trigger locks,I have used these locks before and have been very happy with them. This is no exception. Good product and good bargain. Thanks!
4,Easy to use,"I haven't used trigger locks before and was told they can be a pain to use, but these go on easily and are very secure."
3,Adequate,"This product is ""semi secure"" at best. It does an adequate job of blocking the trigger (as is it's intent) however, for those new to ""safe"" gun keeping should be aware that a chambered round is always playing russian roulette. Remember, this product DOES NOT disable the hammer function."
3,Works as designed... Not a problem,"Purchased to provide a bit of peace of mind for my Ruger GP-100. Doesn't fit perfectly, but does the job. I have yet to try affixing one to my Benelli SuperNova. For the price, per piece, you pretty much can't go wrong."
4,They do the job... mostly.,"It would be hard for Master to design a lock that fits on all weapons. These locks fit on most of my guns. While these easily lock my Sig and Kimber full-size sidearms, they are too big for both of my Walthers (9mm and 22 cal). Otherwise, excellent locks for rifles (except lever-action, of course) and the larger pistols."
1,Can't Unlock,"I purchased this item & now we can not get it off the gun.. You say it is easy, the store that carries this procust can't even get it off.... Supposed to have a button unlock feature when not locked with key. IT DOES NOT WORK CAN'T REMPVE IT!"
3,Bronzing Mousse,"I was so excited to receive this product because I read so many great things about it, but It wasn't as great as I was expecting. It gave me an okay tan the first day, but when I shower 24 hours later the tan washed off. I had the product on my hand and it washed off throughout the day when I washed my hands. Also, this mousse really seeps into your pores. It looked a bit gross and the hair follicles on my leg looked nasty as well. For the price, I wouldn't by this again."
3,"This product is OK, at best.","I heard so much about this product, but it doesnt soak in as well as a lotion would and the color doesnt last for more than one day. Once you wash it off it is basically gone. It doesnt ""tan"" the skin, its just topical. I will go back to using a lotion that actually dyes the skin and gives color for a few days. this product works for if you want to look tan at the time you put it on, not for days after."
5,"No Odor, Even color","This is one of the self tanners with the least amount of ""tanning product"" odor. It also goes on without streaks and gives a nice color"
4,Great self tanner,"I have tried many self tan lotions and gels, but this product does the best. The mousse tries quickly and the color is not orange. The only complaint I have is that when it was shipped my bottle had leaked a bit. :("
1,Limagreen color tan,"My wife read all of the great reviews for this product and ran to buy it at Sephora, she bought the mitt and applied it and was left with limagreen bean legs and arms, she has been exfoliating since and still has some of the green color left. It is hard to believe how bad this product worked for her, perhaps if it was Halloween time she could go as the witch!Sephora was really suprised and said that perhaps she should have been given a lighter color than the dark one which they had sold her."
2,Stains fabrics!,"Ok so I follow the directions to a T. Tan looks nice, reasonably easy to apply, even. I do not shower or sweat for at least 4 hours after application...nor do I get into bed within that period. But my sheets, once a nice ivory color are orangey-pink where my legs rest in bed. The only place I use this mousse is on my legs! If the directions say you can get dressed in 60 seconds after application, it should not stain sheets more than 4 hours later! Yikes! Use dark sheets on your bed when using this product."
2,Don't Like,This product STINKS so bad when you put it on. It makes your skin look very yellow. I didn't like it.
2,dislike button,"A sales consultant at Sephora misled me to this product, assuring that it was top notch and worth the price. My 10 dollar loreal product works much better. It is VERY difficult to get this product to lay on your skin evenly. The next day you will find uneven splotches all over your body, even if you follow their directions to exfoliate and moisturize. I've tried it numerous times, and each day I found myself frustrated with the quality. It says to wait 60 seconds before dressing, but it takes much longer to dry than that. The only positive is that does show a tan after using it one time."
5,Totally in LOVE with this product,"I have been using this particular self-tanning brand for over 5 years now. I can't imagine my life without it. This mouse specifically is my favorite. It is dark in color so you know exactly where it is going on the body and helps to prevent any streaking. It drys super quick and lasts a very long time. I feel this is the most natural color I have ever seen out of a self-tanner. I have tried too many to count let alone mention and this is the bomb as far as I am concerned. I am a very pale, very dark haired person and this product overnight makes it look like have have spent a week on a beach somewhere."
5,Terrific,"This is the best tanning cream ever. Trust me, no streaks, looks natural. I've bought at least 20 different kinds of tanning lotions and this will be the only kind I ever purchase again."
5,Best self tanner ever!,I have used several self tanning products over the years and this is the absolute best one! I use this as an all over tanner during the summer months and as a face and neck tanner during the winter. In the summer I apply heavier coats and in the winter I use a lighter application or blend with face lotion. I always use gloves for heavier applications and will apply liberally and rub in as I would lotion. I'll let it dry for a bit and will then just put on sweats and will sleep with the tanner on. In the morning I just rinse off in the shower and an amazing tan is revealed! I've given little samples of this to so many people trying to get them to try it. I know a bunch of people who have had bad experiences with self tanners because they've used the wrong ones- this is the right one!
5,Works amazing on fair skin,"This product is awesome. It lasts up to a week with one application, and you get a lot of uses out of one bottle. I have very light skin, and this doesn't make me look orange or cause weird blotches around my feet and hands. If your using this though, get an application mitt. They smooth everything out and won't stain your palms."
4,"Great, easy to use self-tanner","I love the St. Tropez line - very easy to use, no streaks, and it doesn't have that nasty self-tanner smell. It drys almost instantly and leaves behind a nature looking tan."
2,Orange!,"I'm starting to think people who say these products don't turn you orange are not really checking it outside in natural light. Most of the products look fine indoors, it's when you go outside in natural sunlight where they SCREAM ""Orange tan!"". Just like all the other ones I've tried, this turns you an Orange/Yellow color. Still trying to find one that looks somewhat real. Fake Bake isn't much better. I think I've tried them all now. There must be something out there. I hate to go back to real tanning. I can tan in the sun, it's just so hard on your skin. Ages you fast."
3,Not as good as I had expected,"I have heard so much about this product and how it doesn't turn that color orange. So I was very surprised the next day when it was orange looking. I thought it was terrible. And, I had exfoliated, put it on with gloves, and rubbed it in smoothly just as expected. Very disappointed."
2,There are better products at qvc,"At the beginning seems like a good coverage but there are a lot better products out there. It's really messy, sticky and smells horrible"
4,Did they change the formula??,"I have used this product for a few years and always loved it. This bottle is in their new packaging and seems like perhaps they changed the formula. It was always a medium to dry whipped kind of mousse which dried very quickly once you applied it. The latest bottle is much more ""wet"" and takes longer to dry on your skin, thus preventing one from dressing immediately. That being said, it is the darkest tanner around and the most easy to spread and create a streak free effect."
1,Not what expected!,"Not what I expected this product to be....This product made me look orange with uneven spots, yes I exfoliate and moisturized prior application, it made me smell like a dirty shoe for a week shower after shower. My skin burned in few spots i found it to be really strange, Not sure if the product was old or compromised or just bad, it did NOT have a safety seal so there is no way of knowing how legitimate this product is. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. I had so many bronzers and self tanners - different variety of brands this is not on my top of my list-$38 waisted.Gave it 1 stars because it gave me uneven- fake looking tan."
2,So far so good,I wanted to try this product as it was recommended to even out my skin color before make-up. I should have bought the mitt for one thing but it was sold by a different seller and I would have had to pay seperate shipping. Its messy and it stains my palm even though the directions say to put it on there so buy the mitt. I will probably purchase it now. I have used it on my face only and if your looking for a bronzer that washes off and doesnt tan this will be your product. I havent seen a difference in the color of my face after I wash it off.
2,ORANGE,"i am white, very white. if i dont use self tanners i will glow in the dark white! i have tried it all from drugstore brands to high end department store tanning products (even bought an airbrush for tanning!) i read some reviews on this product and decided to give it a try.... waste of time....the application was nice, fairly even and easy to apply, dried quickly....however when i stepped out of my bathroom and into the natural light i saw my legs looked faked baked! awful color not olive or brown at all, but i thought it might just be the instant color covering a beautiful olive tan underneath.... i took a shower the next day with warm water and did not scrub my legs at all. i got out and lightly dried off,looked at my legs and they were dollar store fake tan orange,and most of the product was gone!!!!! i was pissed! i dont know what all the hype is about. i am returning!!!"
2,Not what I expected,After reading all the good reviews I was very excited to try this product out. Don't buy this product. Its impossible to leave it on for the recommended four hours. I can hardly leave it on for one hour. I feel sticky and gross like I haven't showered in weeks. Have no Idea if it actually leaves a tan because I have to shower right after putting it on.
1,unsatisfied customer of Planet Beauty,"St. Tropez is a very good product, i don't have anything bad to say about it, but i've sth to say about their customer service. i sent my product back ( it was new), but never got my refund. they didn't have any proof that it was delivered. do u think it's fair? i don't"
3,Was just OK for me,Maybe I got a bad batch or something but this stuff was not all that great to me.I did everything I was supposed to do like exfoliate before I used it and applied it correctly . The smell was ok but to me it was too runny even though it's a mousse and I couldn't tell that much difference the next day. I gave it 3 stars because it didn't streak and the smell was pretty good compared to other self tanning products but I was not impressed and would not recommend it.
3,Hi,"This is okay, it is a little steaky. You have to get it exactly on and very quickly cause if you overlap it becomes darker."
5,great,My husband and I use this product and like it very much. If you are dedicated to the time and process it reaps good results.
5,Tan,"This is a great self tanner. I have been using it for years. However, you must use a mitt or you will have stains."
3,Missing the old product this one replaced,"Judgment is still out on this product. Used the instant self whipped bronze tanner for a long time and loved it. This was suppose to replace it and it is not the same. It doesn't cover as well and since I started using this product, my skin is extremely itchy. Not sure if it's the product or something else, although I haven't used it for a couple of days and my skin is not as bad. ???? I WANT THE OLD PRODUCT BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Needs a mitt!!,"This brand has been my go to brand for many years. Sure I try newer brands but I always return to this one. Positives...you can see where you are putting it so it doesn't streak. It doesn't smell unpleasant. Very pretty color. Once you get your desired shade it stays on for a week. Negatives...you must use a mitt, especially on your back, to put it on evenly. Although the directions say that you can apply wait several hours and put on a second layer to boost your tanning process. I did it the regular way and then I tried the boosting method a week later. The second layer does look as if you have a deeper tan, but, the color comes off on your clothing, anything you brush up against, the sheets, etc. When you get in the shower it all comes off, leaving you with the initial color from one layer. Complete waste of product. I will never do that again, but will continue to buy. Hope this helps."
3,"Jalapeno: Awsome Tase, can only eat 5 at a time...","There is 3,800 MG of sodium in this entire 10oz bag, that's alot of salt. It's very salty, its unnessary for the flavor, but hey, its awsome when you eat like 5 pieces, than another 5 an hour later. I reccomend these"
2,Order with caution,"These taste great and arrived well packaged. However, be prepared to eat these in a hurry - the expiration date was only 2 weeks away when they arrived. Eat quickly or throw away. Amazon really needs to improve this problem."
4,Great Taste - Goes fast,Everyone in the family (and my daughter's friends) like these. Even though you get 12 bags they don't last long. Need to refill every few months.
4,Brazil nut effect?,"These taste great and they are my snacking weakness! however, they get on my nerves because the non-uniformaly shaped pieces exhibit the brazil nut effect where granular particles of similar/equal density tend to be on top aka the larger pretzel pieces tend to be in the first handful but as you eat more the smaller ones are always on the bottom of the bag no matter what you do. frustrating but unavoidable. just be aware.snyder should get a better pretzel chipper machine or whatever they use and keep the size consistent! if it works for potato chips why can't it work for pretzel???"
1,"Salty,Salty,Salty,Salty and more salty","Very flavorful, jalapeno is a fantastic concept for Pretzels. Random bags yield random results, the first pretzel in your mouth is an awesome experience, for the most part.But, for crying out loud, why do they have to add an YEAR'S WORTH OF SALT in one friggin bag?!! It's not consistent, sometimes you get lucky with the top portion of the bag when it's not all that salty, but by the end of one bag, you do get the feeling that you have consumed an ocean's salt content. Why this idiocy? When all one craves for is the taste of spicy jalapeno? The sucker that I am, I eat the first couple of pretzel pieces and then throw the whole bag away, it's serious sodium poisoning if you do consume the whole bag."
2,Not the best Snyder's of Hanover Pretzels,"Snyder's of Hanover makes good pretzels (Honey Mustard & Onion is my favorite), but these are just not appetizing at all. ""Hot Buffalo Wing"" gets its kick from dried cayenne pepper sauce. So if you are a fan of peppers you might like this pretzel. They are nowhere near as good as Honey Mustard in my opinion, though they aren't as bad as just cheddar cheese. Hot Buffalo seems to be enhanced by eating them with other food, in my case, chocolate M&M's. If you like a spicy zing, try these pretzels, they are not horrible. If you like sweetness just stick to Honey Mustard & Onion. Nutrition-wise, are not the best as they contain MSG and caramel color. Also, if you consumed an entire 10 oz. bag in one sitting, you would be consuming 1400 calories. I guess their good if you are trying to gain weight like I am trying to do. Otherwise stick to the healthier counterpart of the unflavored ones."
4,YUM!,"These are awesome tasting, like authentic Ranch dressing, but dont eat too many in one sitting as the flavour can overpower!"
5,Quality Presels,"Snyder's are the best quality pretzels, in my opinion. The fact that they have been around for 100 years speaks for itself.Also as a retail convenience store I get my supply from Amazon because the price is right. On Subscribe and Save I make over 40% at retail price as oppose to the 25% I use to with a local middle man distributor."
1,too spicy and hot,"i tried this taste after good experience with the other tastes, but this one is not tasty at all.I do not recommend it."
5,Food of the Gods,"I just love these pretzels. There was only one bag on the shelf at the store today and I nearly had a heart attack! Totally panicked thinking ""Oh no what if they have discontinued them"" I sure hope they never will!"
5,Glorious Material!,So much material and clear understanding is in this book. I recommend it to anyone who is hungry to know about 1 Corinthians 12-14 and what is really being said to whom and why.
2,The Mediocrity of American Brie,"This brie is as good or better than any brie that can be purchased in this country (The US), but it pales in comparison with a real Brie de Meaux made with un-pasteurized milk that one can buy in countries unaffected by raw-milk phobia. Probably a 4 on a scale of 1-10."
2,Rocket didn't work,"Standard action figure with a backpack air pump attached to rocket launcher on wrist that is supposed to launch a plastic projectile that you fill with water and pump with air. Water leaks out of the projectile, pumping air didn't seem to hold pressure, and rocket would not launch when pressing button. My son still plays with the figure so it's not a total waste but if you're looking for a spiderman figure for your child go with a different one."
1,"Hiroshige""s Fan Prints: R. Faulkner","I never received this book due to an error inavailability on the seller""s part."
3,IFFY Buy,"Sure these look great compared to the drab white or black controllers; however, the screwdriver included with the kit doesn't work very well and easily strips the screws...(be carefull). Have had mine in place for about 6 months and like them. Be warned also that the finish does wear of with usage... heavy gamer myself and the chrome finishes started to wear off to a white spot in about 2 months."
4,Good safety glasses,"I like these kind of (sun)glasses as they are metal framed and can be adjusted to fit your face. I happen to have a large face and most of the metal frames on the market are made for normal sized faces (not to be confused that these can't be worn by everyone, it's just that these are adjustable). The nose piece is one whole piece and it's soft and pliable so that's a positive too. I'd say the only down side is that the lenses scratch too easily. But don't they all."
1,IMPORTANT REVIEW - SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT TO SAVE MONEY ON BATTERIES. HOWEVER THE AC ADAPTER AND THE CAR POWER ADAPTER DID NOT WORK. BOUGHT FOR MY SON'S BIRTHDAY. VERY UNHAPPY CHILD, VERY UNHAPPY PARENT. READ BEFORE YOU LEAP. THANK YOU FOR READING THIS REVIEW."
3,A great summer read.,"So what exactly drives the requirements of a summer novel? Not too deep? Gone from memory once the book is closed?Well, both apply here. The author is indeed a good storyteller, but the formula of the gay summer novel has been done ad nauseum, and this book doesn't add anything fresh to the mix.There will always be celebrity names, there will always be hot guys, there will always be a scandal, and the main character will always triumph with minor struggle/wind damage endured.The author is well aware of the formula, and writes one of the better stories I've seen while using it, but little separates it from the work of Doug Guinan et al.Best advice: buy it used, then recycle accordingly."
5,"Delightful, SEXY and shameless! Try to stop reading it!","I heard about this book from a review in UNZIPPED Magazine that said, ""****! At last, a gay Jackie Collins novel! If Aaron Spelling is reading this review, he should buy it for a series. NOW!"" This is a terrific book in many ways: (1) it's impossible to put down; (2) the barrage of erotic scenes don't cheat on the heat, you may need asbestos gloves when handling these pages; (3) the Hollywood guessing game of thinly-veiled celebrities in fictional form is as entertaining at those weekly blind items on the gay gossip column ...; (4) it has a nasty, biting, bitchy sense of humor; (5) it has an honestly engrossing STORY of backstabbing ruthlessness that reminded me of ALL ABOUT EVE and SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS; and (6) when it IS made into a Showtime series (like QUEER AS FOLK, which it resembles) you can say, ""Oh, I read that LAST SUMMER and the book was better!"" Its the ONE book I'm recommending to ALL my friends this season."
1,Did I read a different book?,"Since I'm sure the author worked very hard on this novel, I hesitate to dump on it. However, I feel potential buyers deserve at least some warning about this novel's awfulness. To be fair, it actually starts out somewhat promising if rather conventional. I enjoyed Rod's character as Hispanic characters are few and far between in gay fiction. But the novel quickly disintegrates into unbelievably silly scenes, cloying dialogue (what passes for 'love' between Bart and Rusty will make you diabetic if you aren't already) and a plot that becomes plain stupid. And the novel's few 'twists' are either told outright before they happened or so foreshadowed as to be ridiculous. Do yourself a favor and read Michael Nava, Michael Cunningham, or Stephen McCauley, but do not read this."
1,The Real Trick is getting through this book!,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. This was my first exposure to Ben Tyler, and it will be my last. Poorly written and poorly edited.Save your time."
2,A story that tried,"I think the idea of this story was worth telling, but that was the problem. It was told, not shown. I kept waiting for some action. All I read was narrative. It was as if some person was sitting there telling you about it, but you never watched it on the screen.The ending seemed improbable. I wanted some kind of revenge but the 'epilogue' left me angry. Wasn't that the point of the book? I wish this one could be rewritten with more of the action shown. It wouldn't have been a bad read then. It won't stop me from picking up another one of his books."
2,Painless but thin and surprisingly sloppy,"I have nothing in particular against mindless fluff -- heck, I certainly didn't buy a book with a cover like this one's looking for an intellectual exercise --and by most standards this novel is pretty harmless. But in a book that purports to be narrated by a Hollywood insider, would it be asking too much that the names of mainstream celebrities at least be spelled correctly? Jane ""Krakowsky""? ""Courteney"" Love? Milla ""Jovovic""? Oh, and my personal favorite two-for-one blooper, ""Toby McGuire""? Those were merely the ones I noticed in two adjacent paragraphs on the same page. Elsewhere there's a reference to the painter Marc ""Chagal"" and another to actor ""Darin"" McGavin. Never mind the other typos and errors such as the sentence in which two characters got into a limo and ""road [sic] down the hill."" Did I mention all the above are within the first 80 pages? I'm by no means a professional copy reader. Neither is the editor of this book, by all appearances."
1,TRRRASH!!,"You don't expect a book with a cover like this to be genuinely good or well written; you're only look for some cheap thrills with a page turner you won't be embarassed to be seen with on the beach. Even on this low level, ""Tricks"" fails. The depiction of the inner workings of show biz seems to be cribbed from ET outtakes, lots of ""bitchy"" remarks (many of them wince inducing), not an iota of insight. And the gay material is either smutty or saccharine. The ""twists"" are so obvious you can see them coming a mile away. A gay Jackie Collins is needed, but Ben Tyler is not a contender. I couldn't even finish this thing. How did it get published?"
4,"Great card, easy configuration","I just grabbed this product from FRYs and love it.Easy installation and works very well.I am using it with wireless router (Netgear)and in the Internet cafe everyday.However, the plastic part is very fragile.I have been using this for a 10 month and there is a crack in black part."
2,Thin Socks,I bought these as a gift for my son he who said they come up to his knees and are very thin
4,Totally 'jacked!,"I usually expect erotic novels to be plotless stories about pizza delivery men/pool boys/mechanics who just have sex with a different person each chapter. But ""Mindjacker"" actually has a plot! It even has subplots! And it still has all the sex (and more) that you'd want from this type book (including a scene with a delivery man and two with mechanics--but no pool boy). A lot of fun to read."
4,Wise Choice for Learning Infectious Diseases,"This text book is outstanding in terms of clear pictures and detailed descriptions. It exhibits numerous color photos which help remember the clinical signs and appearances of common infectious diseases. On the other hand, the text excellently outlines and explains the underlying theory and treatments. This book takes a modern approach to teach Microbiology by introducing the contents in a system based mannar. This is very different from the traditional way of teaching the subject in which the materials are delivered species by species. I think this way is more clinically relevant and thus, suits the needs of health care students."
2,"Should be called ""Producing Digital Video""","I waited and waited to purchase this book because I had recently bought a Canon XL2 and wanted to know how to get that ""film look"" by shooting in 24p. After several months of delays, the book was finally released and I bought it. When I read through it I realized that this book was not what the title said it was. 95% of this book talks about the basics of film making; use of wide angle and telephoto lenes, continuity, lighting, etc. While helpful in its own right, this is not why I bought the book. There are maybe two chapters that talk about getting the film look for digital video. I probably could have gotten more detailed instruction off of message boards and newsgroups.If you're looking for a ""how to"" when it comes to 24p, pass on this book. Save the money and do some investigating on the web. I'm sure you'll find a number of sources that will be able to walk you through the process and you may even get individual instruction."
4,Brought new life into my TT,"I bought this stylus for the value and price point in order to get a vintage TT up and runningand it has performed so well Ive decided to keep it on my my primary system. You just cant get a betterstylus for the money, my LPs sound better than ever with Dynamic mids and highs.Paired up with one of the Grado cartridges of wich many will interchange you cant go wrong."
4,freaked antiques,"I liked this comp much better than the first ""inspirations"" because of it's obscurity of tracks.. not the same ""classic"" dance tracks that we're almost sick of and want to put back into hibernation... this one's recommended. Also, this is excellent party material, if they like Old School, they'll love this!"
3,This book contains good reference on available tools,"I liked and dis-liked this book. It provided a comprehensive description of availble monitoring and measurement tools for Windows NT. On the other hand, the many case studys were often too simple and left me feeling something was missing."
4,Performance Monitor or Performance Monitoring?,"The book was well focused on Microsoft Performance Monitor (ie, how to configure PerfMon) and provided some good insight on how to read and determine problems with specific counters. Some trouble-shooting techniques were provided, however very weak in substance. The majority of this book was really focused on PerfMon and reading and understanding the counters, bottom line. The spelling was unusually high in errors, and a spelling checker would have done this book good. I am surprised it actually got published like this! At any rate, I still feel I got my money's worth and I feel more confident using PerfMon and understanding counter values and what sort of error you may be experiencing if you exceed the threshold of some of these values."
2,Disappointing,"After reading so many glowing reviews, this book was a real disappointment. It is very long on self-congratulatory anecdotes on how well this ""method"" works and how great it is to have an unspoiled child, and very short on concrete examples of what to do. It also contains lots of references to how scary it is and how miserable you'll be if you don't get your child under control by age 2, which is not helpful when the book fails to give many examples of what to do to avoid such dire circumstances."
2,don't buy unless you have an infant,"I bought this book to help me deal with my two year old who was acting up, but the premise of this book is that if you are having problems with you're two year old, you probably screwed them up in the first year and it's too late to really do anything about it. Basically, you're screwed and it's because you spoiled them. Needless to say, this didn't help me. I completely agree with other reviews which said that the author divides children into angels and brats with no in betweens. Not helpful. I wish I would have taken more heed to the bad reviews, because apart from a few decent recomendations, this book was a complete waste of time."
2,Boring,This book is wordy and dry. He makes the same point over and over and yet offers no practical solution or techinques a parent would be reading this book for in the first place.
2,"Disappointed, for the most part.","I didn't agree with most of what Burton L. White has to say. I found the book far too theoretical. Very little practical advice. All in all, I found the book rather boring and dry. To me, this book is very overrated. Most parenting books that I have read, I have found extremely useful - ""The Difficult Child,"" ""Parenthood by Proxy,"" all the books by the Eyres, etc. This was not at all useful to me."
3,"too many words, not enough practical advice","I found this book very hard to get through...lots of antecdotes and black text but hard to sometimes glean the ""how to"" info from all the verbiage."
5,"Excellent Advice, Make Time to Read It!","I think any parent will benefit from the advice in this book. Dr. White's early childhood development techniques are practical and proven effective. If his claims are correct and the young children on his program are still, years later, better adjusted than their counterparts who weren't, this book should be mandatory reading for parents."
3,Not that helpful for parents of gifted children?,"I found the advice in this book appealing (it's much the way I like to do things anyway). I was excited by the research. But I was frustrated because the description of the child's social development does not match my kids at all. My daughter was a delight from 14-24 months - the time frame when she was ""supposed"" to be testing me. She took direction, minimum tantrums, played well on her own, etc. Around 24 months the testing hit, and we are still in the thick of it (though outsiders tend to call her a ""delight"" - as mom, I see the testing going on). According to this book, a testing 2 year old is the mark of an overindulged child. But this simply isn't the case with ours. The book ""Loosing Our Minds"" has alot of interesting and useful information for parents of gifted children. Often gifted children do not develop according to neat little timelines that scientist and baby trainers prefer."
2,no actual advice,"I picked this book in my local libraby while browsing the shelves, so I had no expectations whatsoever and had not read any reviews. The author describes in great detail the normal behaviour of a baby from newborn to 3 years of age, and specifically what is undesirable. However, I didn't find almost any suggestions on how to deal with it! The other thing I really disliked is that he strongly urges the stay at home moms to find someone (teenager) to take care of the baby for couple of hours on regular basis."
3,"Not Bad, I Guess",I got this for my I-pod mistakenly thinking it might help me while running. The arm band is pretty useless because of the weight of the I-pod and takes forever to get adjusted and strapped on. The hip clip and swivel are actually awesome and the neoprene wrapper itself fits good and has convenient openings.
2,Boring,"I have read most of C. S. Lewis's works. I have read some Kreeft before and I enjoyed his writings. However, these essays are boring. I could not get through them. The essays have very little to do with what Lewis thought and a lot to do with what Kreeft thinks about. What's more after the first essay, I could care less what Kreeft thinks about. I would suggest that you reread ""Abolition of Man"" again and save your money."
2,Not what it's cracked up to be,"I normally enjoy Kreeft, and there are some merits to this book. His essay about whether the moral code can be abolished at all is very interesting.That said, I got a book full of ""Brave New World is upon us!"" I don't disagree with that point, but I was hoping for more on ""The Abolition of Man"". If you're really looking for someone to tell you that the Brave New World is here, read this book, otherwise, get something else."
4,loved them,I got exactly what i ordered. But it was a pin putting them together. But at least it was exactly what I ordered. Cause I experianced wrong items before and misleading info on others items I ordered from amazon.
1,Beware!!,"The model included with the text is VERY difficult to build. I am an engineer and it took me about 5 hours to build. I was planning to use it for my middle school Robotics class. But not now. Construction requires ALOT of very fine tieing, threading, and crimping. The wires are difficult to see and difficult to manipulate. Also, the textbook is very advanced -not meant for novices or even college students with little electronics background."
3,"stiquito, a very quick review","I think that the idea of stiquito is wonderfull. This book goes into a fair amount of detail about the concepts involved, and gives a good starting point to build the kit from. However I do not think that the book gives the best step by step instructions for building the basic stiquito robot."
5,"A fascinating ""hands-on"" robotics book!","What other robotics book comes with its own robot? That is what makes this book so cool. It takes some skill to assemble, but it walks once you're done. The book gives you the building instructions for the robot and features articles written by those inspired by Stiquito to create more sophisticated units based on its design. The chapters on the SCORPIO robot illustrate how much a group of students can be inspired to achieve! Definitely a must-have book for those interested in robotics."
2,Misfires,"Two people on my trim crew purchased this gun after seeing how well the 23ga works, but both have had to buy something else after 6 months. The driver seems to slip off of the nail head on both of these, and leaves a much larger hole than necessary. If you back off the driver, it doesn't sink the nail. I love the Grex 23ga guns, but can't recommend the 18ga."
3,Same Penn Plex of years ago....,"This is the exact same Penn Plax plates I used about 20 years ago. Very little changes have been made over the years... :) They STILL have the same issue with holding the plates together, at least long enough to get them into the bottom of the aquarium. Penn Plex COULD do a little more design work on the molds to fix this problem.....this of course will NEVER HAPPEN."
5,mackie cfx20,"I love this board. The mic preamps have better range when compared to behringer and peavey. The sound doesn't fade or distorted when the volume increases. It also comes with 16 Mic preamps when most boards in this class has 8-12. The subgroups could be directed to the main, aux AND 4 individual sub outs. I'm a sound tech that provided sound for 100's of concerts and I must say that singers and other sound techs are surprised when I show them the features on this board and tell them the price. I love this board and recommend it to everyone. You will not be disappointed."
5,Good mixer for a small church,Has been using for over a month. Clean sound. Has to route all channels through subgroups. Has the potential for use in larger setup/ live shows/ venues. Good build quality. Nice design and layout .
1,Damaged item...,"Bought a mixing board listed as ""good shape"" no problems listed either. Later to find the main console ribbon is bad. Mediawerks dishonestly listed the mixer. It was to be used in church after renovation was completed. Board was never used until it was installed. It had been unpacked and checked for physical damage, but unfortunately we did not check the electrical components. Mediawerks was contacted, all they would say is not obligated due to being outside return policy. Then they state they have videos of the board working (not listed to see before purchase). After videos were requested, they send them in a way you have to make purchase of software via the net to view. Great job mediawerks would not expect anything less. Got taken for over $500.00 bucks. Only one star because they do not offer -'s or zeros. Rip-off's"
2,Meh...,"You can find a lot better and more up to date info on the web. Not particularly useful or informative, though there's a few nice pics. Check out The Complete Ball Python by Kevin McCurley for a real ball python book."
3,Just athought,I can't see trusting the comments of a book that Says ball Pythons when its cover has a picture of an Albino Bermese Python. These are diferent snakes and many difference in the care of em just a thought my 2 cents worth. havent bought it but review is forcing me to rate it i will go middle ground for fairness
3,The Bare Minimum,"It has been argued that there is free and more fresh information on the web.Well, that's exactly true. But the point of this book is to provide the amateur with a handy, basic, simplified guide to homing this pet. The basics of these herps hasn't changed. This to-the-point reference with good color photos only costs a couple bucks-well worth it."
2,Ok beginners guide,The book is a very basic beginners guide. Most of the information that was in this book was found online so I wasnt impressed at all with the content.
2,Definatly NOT a beginners manual or any manual at all,this book is useless if yu buy your snake from the pet storeie captive bredits more for breeders and pple who got their snake imported from africa. it has practically five sentences on shedding with no help at all with shedding problems or how to set up a habitat. this is not a good begginners book just a general info book if you are intersted in different types of ball pythons not how to take care of one. it does have nice pictures though of the different kinds.overally its a nice book to give someone who wants to see if they are intersted in the snake not on how to take care of a captive bred one
5,Very informational,Great read for anyone who is thinking about owning a ball python or someone who already owns one who would like to expand there knowledge
3,Ok book for starters,"this is an ok book for a starter or someone who just wants a ball/royal for a pet, but it is not as good as most the books I have read."
3,"Geared towards ""wild caught""","This a good manual for 1st timers, which is what I am. If you are looking for a GREAT manual, this isn't it. It seems to refer to ""wild caught"", which in my opinion isn't the best way to obtain a ball python. If you are looking at how to care for your ball python, there are better books out there, but this is a fairly good start. You are better off getting your info from the net or [[ASIN:0976733404 Complete Ball Python, A Comprehensive Guide to Care, Breeding, and Genetic Mutations] Although this book is more expensive, it's more informative and you will get more out of it."
3,Good basic information,"There's nothing new for advanced keepers here, but for those starting out, it's a cheap way to get basic care information. And it's an albino BALL python on the cover, not a Burmese as stated by another reviewer."
5,ESSENTIAL FOR ALL FAMILY BARRISTERS,"Roger Bird is a district judge who has countless years of experience in dealing with First Appointments, FDR's and Final Hearings. He is well respected as an excellent and practical family Judge.Every serious money family lawyer needs this book.Most sensible barristers in my chambers (who do family) have it, and regularly refer to it.It is perhaps too comprehensive at times - and I found myself getting a little caught up in the detail. But it covers it all.One criticism: the company valuation stuff is a bit thin - but hey the author is a District Judge and not a forensic accountant what do we expect?There are books which are more comprehensive but they are usually loose leaf publications and dont fit into a briefcase.All junior tenants need it"
5,"""...the finest pilot memoir of WW II.""","""It is, I think, the finest pilot memoir of WW II. I have made it mandatory reading for all my historians."" Quote attributed to: Dick Hallion, Historian of the U.S. Air Force, in ""Mustangs and Legends,"" July 1999 AOPA Pilot Magazine, page 91."
3,glasswerk review,"Dancehall Places is the follow up to last year's acclaimed debut On the Ropes, and is an eclectic mix of joyous blues and handbag beats. The opening 'Blue Song' bubbles along like a summer treat, and ska legend Prince Buster's claim in 'Sexiest Man in Jamaica' is indicative of the mood of the whole album. 'Anything' and 'Floor Basics' are straight-to the-dancefloor barnstormers, and the title track collaboration with Jez Williams of Doves fame is an absorption of guitar-based splendour and wonderment. 'Miles and Miles' wouldn't be out of place in a Moby record, and 'Princess' is of a similar ilk. De La Soul's Pos' breezy contribution to new single 'Show Me' is both relaxing and stimulating at the same time, and '54' revs the engine of this album up a notch. 'I Don't Know' is a similar feet-tapper, and 'Always Welcome' is simply heart-warming. Can't decide what to listen to after a hard night out clubbing? Mint Royale have got the perfect solution to your problem.Ricky"
2,It looks great but did not last.,"I loved the table as soon as I saw it, it was the perfect size and color for my 3-yr-old son. I got it and it is sturdy enough, but about 2 weeks into use ( son barely uses it) and the chairs already had rips. The table has a small hole on top. It just seems that the plastic covers just tears appart.I am not happy with the materials."
5,Excellent Value,I am so very pleased with the purchase of the Cars Table and Chairs. Adding the option to purchase an additional set of folding chairs was perfect. As a grandmother I do not need the table and chairs out all the time but love having it when my grandchildren come over. The children loved it and each has claimed his/her seat. The safety feature of the chairs and table locking in place to avoid accidentally folding up on them is wonderful. Love it!
1,I'd make it zero stars if I could,"I'm sorry, but I have to disagree with everyone else. This table/chair set is just another example of Chinese made junk.The seats have screws that are supposed to hold the cushions to the frame, but the wood on the seat bottom is so weak that the screws don't even thread into it, they just rip the wood apart making it so the cushions won't stay on the frame so they set on the frame unattached (so safe for my kid - riggtttt)The table I'm actually okay with - but the absolute GARBAGE build of the seats make this a DO NOT BUY recommendation.Back to the store it goes - labelled as complete JUNK!"
5,The Perfect Table,"I bought this table for my 2 year old son for christmas amongst other things. he woke up christmas morning, pushed everything out of the way to sit at his new CARS table. It is very well made and has a great design on the top."
5,"27' Sailboat, Parents, 2 kids, Mother-in-Law? Bring it ON!","That's right, Wayne packed his wife, two teen-aged daughters and his Mother-in-Law into a Nor'Sea 27. Then, they sailed from San Diego to New Brunswick. Even though Wayne and his family are experienced cruisers, he approaches the book in terms of reality - even mentioning that Point Conception still scares the bajeezus out of him. This book is very encouraging for those with a family and limited budget for that 60 foot 'family' cruiser. There are many boats in the 30' range that would work and Wayne proves it in this book.I was inspired to find this book after reading an article about it in Cruising World. I was bummed when I found it was no longer in print (I see there are 4 used copies available here...buy one!) As a demonstration of the generosity of cruisers, I mentioned this book on a BBS and one of the chaps there said he'd be glad to send it to me. Now I have it and would gladly share with anyone interested."
2,Be wary of caffeine levels,"Product works except caffeine levels are very high. Anyone sensitive to caffeine should not purchase this product. Try to read the list of ingredients before purchasing. Otherwise, product seems effective"
3,pillow,"Good product, however...turned out to be not the right thing for me, but because I pulled the tags off I couldn't return this item...still always satisfied with amazon."
4,Good Bed Wedge,"This is a very good bed wedge with fast delivery. However, it says it's coming with a white pillow cover and it came with a blue one."
2,Poor durability,"I purchased this product to help with lower back pain. The wedge did smell a bit on the chemical side at first, although I was able to tolerate the odor until it dissipated (something like a week). Most importantly, it helped tremendously with my back. Unfortunately, this lasted only a couple of months, and now the wedge seems to offer little support (the 7"" vertical height in the back is now naturally compressed to something like 2""). I'm a bit ambivalent about the purchase. Yes, the sleep is worth the money, but I would imagine you could make a more durable pillow."
1,Do not buy this wedge pillow!,"This pillow is like sleeping on a sack of cement! Get memory foam instead. Oh, and when I called Vitality Medical the day after receiving this to say it was completely unacceptable, I learned that I had to pay the $15.00 to ship it back to them. Awful product, horrendous customer service and I'm out $15.00. Be warned!"
3,It's okay,"I bought this cushion to alleviate some acid reflux and found it quite firm, despite the placement of pillows. It works well on conforming surfaces like a sofa. In addition, I keep sliding down- but this may just be a side effect of sleeping against a decline angle. My boyfriend and I will give it another try. It's not bad, just takes getting used to."
3,Horrible chemical smell,"This product is not returnable after you open the plastic, but you can't tell that the thing smells like a horrible chemical spill until you open the plastic. I was able to improve the smell some what by leaving it sit out for a couple weeks and covering the thing in fabreeze. Still not sure if i will be able to actually ever use this or not."
2,Unhappy,"Pillow was too hard. Did not give when head on pillow.Bed Wedge - Foam Wedge Bed Pillow 7.5""x 26"" x 25"". Comes w/ white pillow cover"
3,"Sometimes helps, sometimes hurts","I get acid reflux at night, and my partner snores/has apnea-type symptoms, so I thought we would try this pillow. We have both found our symptoms improve when we use the wedge pillow, but after a night or two, it is so uncomfortable that we just can't sleep on it anymore. I can't get through a whole night on it before my back is killing me and I have to get up and remove the pillow. He can sleep through the night, but is sore all the next day. We have tried a bunch of different arrangements to try to get used to sleeping on the pillow, but so far haven't solved this problem. We keep it now for nights when we really need it -- it works really well for when one of us has a sinus cold -- but have given up on using it nightly. I am on the lookout for a different wedge that might give us the best of both worlds."
3,"it's ok, but.......","this was a gift. the person let me know that the incline was too high and she could not stay on the pillow. The consept is good, but maybe reduce the height."
2,Too stiff for comfort,"The angle is correct for preventing night time acid reflux, but what good is that if you can't sleep? This foam has no give and is very uncomfortable. The angle is too acute to soften with pillows. The more expensive, better quality foam wedges are a better alternative, price not withstanding."
4,satified,I am very satisfied with my wedge pillow. I have acid refux and it allows me to sleep at night with no problem. I toss and turn a lot and it doesn't matter how you sleep its comfortable.
5,Love this!,"I know some have complained that this item is too hard, but I think it is perfect. It is firm enough that I'm not sinking into it, but still comfortable. I'm glad I got the 7 inch height. I sleep with this pillow under my back/head and I think that 10 or 12 inch models would have felt like I was sitting in bed all night long. I am able to sleep on my sides, as well as my back (yep, can sleep on my side with the pillow still under me - the slope is gradual enough that sleeping in my side is still comfortable). I didn't notice any odor when I opened the bag the pillow is in. My only concern (and it doesn't effect me specifically) is that the pillow seems like it may be too short for very tall people. I'm 5'1"" and if the base of the pillow is at my waist, my head is very close to the top of the pillow. I wonder if someone who is very tall may find that their head hangs off the back of the pillow."
1,Horrible Dissapointment,"It was very poor quality, had a nasty fishy smell, and made me itchy on contact. The ""white pillow cover"" was cheap cheesecloth and fell apart when I tried to remove it. Please do not sell this to anyone else!"
2,Starts out great - ends flat,"I purchased this wedge a year ago and it started out working just fine. However after nearly a year of use the bottom portion is essentially flat which means I slide down it more in my sleep which defeats the purpose. I'm now shopping for a more durable product. If you only need it for a limited time then this will work well, but I cannot recommend it for extended use."
4,It works as suggested.,Easy to sleep on and firm enough but not too much. High enough as well. I would recommend this to someone else.
2,not solid enough,"The wedge is an ok size but the material that its made of will compress down to like an inch or so when it has the weight of 110lb body on it, save the $ the name brand wedge"
3,Gets soft fast,"The cover is a cover but not like a pillow case, it more like a dust cover, it should come with a pillow case or have one as an option. It's pretty and not super comfortable. I feel like it has broken down very quickly. I no longer use it."
4,Good product!,"This is a little stiffer than the one I already had, but does an excellent job. We are very pleased with this pillow and the price was great."
2,bed wedge,It's sets up to high up for you to sleep on comfortabley. I do use it for my acid reflux. If I ever have to get another one I won't get one that big
4,Good for sleeping but not great for watching TV,"Like the title says, it is not good for watching TV. Like anything else, every one has their own preference and opinion. I wish that it would have been just a tad more upright. Not so much more pillow as much as the incline angle. This pillow works really well if you are going to sleep and you want it at an angle and your pillow just does not give your neck the support it needs."
2,Hypocritical!,"I was very disappointed in this book. I had always been a big fan of the Dalai Lama...BUT this book was so vague and full of generalities and hypocrisy! I almost could not believe that although the Dalai Lama professes vegetarianism to be the only way to lead a compassionate life .... he feels that he ""has"" to eat meat to stay healthy. What??? Eating meat is against every basic principle of Buddism! And that is not where the hypocrisy ends...I shared this book with others who also found much fault in the Dalai Lama's latest book. He is steering away from true Buddism ... and becoming as ""middle of the road"" as the rest of societies apathetic leaders. Shame."
1,different from the description,"It was supposed to be:# cotton# 92% Cotton, 8% Lycra Spandex;But I have got:%55 Cotton, %35 Polyester, %10 Spandex.So I have returned it."
3,"Melodic country rock, great harmonies!","The Canadian band Blue Rodeo has done it again. Songwriters Jim Cuddy and Greg Keillor have crafted another fine collection of exquisite country rock tunes. The duo has a knack for capturing the essence of relationships, the ups AND the downs, in their lyrics. The disc at times rocks hard, at other times slowing down to an almost brooding type of a crawl. The musicianship is first rate, and rest assured, if you like twangy guitars, this band delivers!"
2,Don't buy these!!!!!,Its a shame that the subwoofer on these is total garbage. Nothing but distortion even at low volumes. The satellite speakers sound pretty decent. There are much better choices out there in the same price range. I really regret purchasing these speakers. Waste of money.
4,Really good sound on games and movies!,"I originally bought for my MP3 player, but started using it for my notebook. Really crisp sound, sounds wonderful on dramatic games and movies, but not on heavy bass. The sub is very ""thump sensitive"" meaning it WILL thump of of any thing. It pumps out lots of air. P.S. dont listin to those people that are saying nothin but bad stuff, personally I think they are from other companies trying to prevent people from buying the product! So thats what i have to say."
2,Not good enough,"They might sound bad to me because I am used to Audiophile headphones. But they don't sound terrible. Nice clean highs, but the bass is a little muddy. Maybe it will clear up in time as they burn in, but for the price... I especially like the volume control and headphone input. It works excellent and matches my system. But these speakers are great for the price. If I spent 100 on them I would be mad with the sound quality, but for less than 30, they are excellent. I just picked up a new pair of speakers which sound way better than these and they were cheaper too. Check out my other reviews on which speakers I got. These will be sitting in my closet for a backup pair, not worth sending them back."
1,"Awful, Awful, just absolutely Awful. Did I mention Awful?","Oh my GOD! These are just the worst speakers with the worst sound I have ever heard. But, when you pay 27.00, you get 27.00 worth of sound I guess........."
4,A good and cheap choice for pleasant audio,"The sound is excellent for this price range. The subwoofer is not really a subwoofer, but it is more of a low frequency speaker. The satellite speakers lacks low frequency output, and I assumed that Cyber Acoustic has designed it that way to save money and to allow the subwoofer to act as a third speaker to balance the audio. The subwoofer has a knob to adjust the level of bass, and there is a volume control device that you can place on your desk. At this price range, the speakers are very good. If you buy this without super high expectations, then you will be pleased and pleasantly surprised with the audio."
5,"sleek, stylish speakers","Works well, love the subtle blue light on the control module. im not really a sound secialist but these speakers deliver great sound by me. recommended"
3,"Great at first, then the volume knob starting having issues.","I have had these speakers for just about a year. They have great audio. I use them in a noisy workplace and they overpower the noise and still sound good! However, after adjusting the volume occasionally throughout the year of ownership, they started to make popping/crackling sounds from the main 2 speakers. Occasionally 1 speaker would quit working, but you just tap on the volume adjuster and it would come back. Now however I get absolutely no sound from one speaker. So it is a 1.1 system now! Overall great speaker set, but I will look for something with a better volume adjuster."
2,Failed.,These speakers worked okay for me for a while until the volume knob failed and I was unable to use them any longer.
3,Not too bad,"Sound is okay, but, not high quality. Standard sound for a standard price. I do like the all-in-one volume knob feature."
5,The best speakers for the price,"I bought these speakers about 2 years ago at a store. They were about $30.I have used them almost everyday for my computer, ipod, phone, etc.No complaints whatsoever.The sound is surprisingly loud and the bass is very deep and sounds very rich.You can get the sound pretty high so that your whole house resonates with music. These speakers are freaking awesome.I recommend you look into Cyber Acoustics as these speakers are just absolutely amazing."
3,Average maybe lower,"This sound system for a desk top computer is just fine for the price. Delivers decent sound, although don't expect it to be crystal clear cranked up, starts crackling. The Bass box is small and delivers an average sound. It is just fine for my PC (I don't crank the thing at max anyway)- I do like the separate volume control since my speakers are hidden. It's an OK sound system for 30 bucks, but you do get what you pay for =o)"
1,sub-woofer does not work,I opened the box and set it all up only to find that the sub-woofer does not function. The two peripheral speakers are quiet and barely louder than my built-in laptop speakers. This is an awful product.
4,Paid $18 with free shipping ...,"They are $25 now. But with the Super Saver shipping these are not bad. Put these on granddaughter's Xmas computer. Only 9V small wall wart for power, so no real output power here. Don't expect loud volumes or high fidelity, but for general usage and game playing these are hard to beat for the price, 'cause you get a nice bass boost over the cheap 2.0 speakers around."
4,awesome base,I just received my speakers and am extremely satisfied with the sound quality. The set up is basic and simple I did it without reading the manual. Very satisfied i can blast my music while doing my household chores. I am using this speaker set with my labtop and the sound quality is great.
4,Good for the price,"If you're on a budget, these are the best choice. they have alot of bass, get pretty loud, good size for a dorm room. these arent the best speakers ive heard, but for 25$, you cant go wrong with them. perfect for use with my laptop"
1,not impressed,"I read lots of positive reviews on these speakers and thought the price was great, so I ordered myself a pair. The sound quality is awful. I have to crank the speaker and PC volume all the way up in order to get a decent level of volume and there is a definite buzzing sound, almost like there is a piece of paper vibrating within the speaker. I would definitely recommend spending your money elsewhere... as with this product, you get what you pay for."
3,this one is just so so,ok...i bought the same speakers like half year ago..at first i think it sounds ok...but when i listen to some hip hop or rap songs...the bass doesn't come out really clear when i turn the music up...and now..i'm trying to find another brand of speakers..since i want the bass to come out clean and smooth...but anyways..this speaker is good at price..
4,Good,"This little system puts out some sound , I have it in a small office and I have it hooked up to my computer and it sounds great"
4,Good Speakers for the money.,Good speakers! I read someone's review that said good bass but not in your face bass. Very True! It's all good.
3,ok for the money,These will work for my modest needs. They seem a little better for my gaming(GRAW2/2Worlds2 Pirates/Flatout2) than my music(classic rock) but that difference could be the recordings/players/sites or who knows. I've only had them about four hours now so no comment on durability. At under $30 I don't expect the world from them.
4,Nice room speakers,These are very good laptop speakers. For a regular room the audio is wonderful. Worth for money. I suggest them.
3,Good sound,"All is well with these speakers, except the fact that they are not durable at all. One speaker is having problems, as its volume is a LOT quieter than the other. No matter what I do, i can't fix this, now i'm stuck with messed up speakers."
4,Best Multi-Condom Pack on the Market!,"I've got to tell you, I've looked around on the internet for a good multi-condom pack for a while now. It's easy enough to buy a 5 or 10-pack and have it delivered without my parents asking what it is, but I end up having to order a pack a week (or more, if it's a good week!! ;^) ) But when I found this package, I knew I'd hit a major home run. It was delivered two weeks ago. My mom asked what it was, and I told her it was a couple shirts from Urban Outfitters. She never said another word, and I went and hid these babies in the closet.The best part of the deal?? The LUBE, baby, the LUBE! The girls go nuts for that stuff. My only suggestion would be that they add a Blueberry or Strawberry lube to the package.Overall, this is a great product. Check it out!!"
1,No Ink no Print,"Ink runs out before you finish all the sheets of paper. Sad, because you can't buy the ink by itself. Kodak is ripping people off. Hopefully a competitor will come up with something fast."
1,worse company i have ever dealt with!,My ink cartridges arrived broken completely shattered. I contact the company asked for a replacement or a refund they refused. I will never deal with this company again. Not only did they refused but it took them a week to respond. I will be notifying amazon about this company!!! I wouldn't recommend this company to ANYONE
5,love this product,"I have had so much fun with Kodak Easy Share Printer. The Kodak paper and cartridge is great, always come out with same amount of cartridge to paper. Great picture quality. I have 2 new grandbabies and have used 2 boxes of this in a little over a month."
4,Great Product for the Money,"I would have given this 5 stars if the info on the Amazon/Kodak website had been a little clearer about the batteries. This camera dock will not charge ""rechargeable"" batteries. You will have to buy a recharger. The website says the dock can be used for recharging your camera but nowhere in the documentation that came with the camera does it say anything about recharging on the dock. I think this is mis-information, but we love the camera anyway and it takes great pictures. The printer prints excellent prints also."
4,Kodak Film Cartridges,"This film cartridges from Kodak are great. However, I have had a couple of them that I have not gotten 40 pictures from. Either the film jams or there are some other problems. I do like this product though."
3,Great Quality but at a high price. 50+ cents per photo.,"I bought this printer and 80 picture kit for my daughter, and she was very excited.The easyshare printer is very easy to use, and the quality of the pictures is excellent. However, the price per picture is very high. My daughter did the math and told me she was getting her pictures developed at a local store from the smart card for 19c each. Using this 80 picture kit costs 50c a picture. The quality is better, but in our opinion..not that much better. Hopefully the price of these kits will drop so that it can compete better and make it worth while to use. Or maybe some other vendors will start marketing ink cartridge/paper refills for it at a cheaper price. If I had known my daughter was getting her pictures printed for 19c, I would not have bought this."
3,Does not work with all easy share printers,"I ordered this cartridge for my mother in law for Christmas to go with the C743 7MP Digital Camera and G600 Printer Dock someone else was buying for her. It does not work with this printer. If you are buying this printer, make sure to order the Gxxx series cartridge."
4,"Great quality, but make less prints than indicated.","The picture quality is great, it's prints the best color directly from the camera. If you're printing from your PC or Mac, then your color will suffer. The number of prints usually falls short. It's abount 2-3 prints short than indicated on the box.Mike"
4,Great Quality....but doesn't go very far for the money,"The picture quality is superior but unfortunately, you won't print the number of pictures advertised. The cartridge will run out long before, especially if you choose the Enhance feature when you print each picture."
5,Excellent,Received PH160 in excellent condition and promptly. Thanks for the great service and the great price......
5,LOVE the easyshare,I purchase the refill kit all the time. Great value compared to purchasing it in the store.
1,Not evenly matched,"I was disappointed to find that my cartridges only lasted for little more than half the paper! I still have 80 sheets left. The problem is that if it ever gets jammed - even if it isn't actually jammed - that uses up the cartridge life! I contacted Kodak directly to see if I could buy just cartridges - and they said NO!!! I am looking for a new printer which is a little more economical...29cents a photo is really not a good deal in the first place, and paying double that even worse!"
2,Ink Cartridge Ripoff,"This is a wonderful machine, and it prints great photos. Unfortunately, my first ink cartridge lasted through only TEN (10) photos before warning me that I am almost out of ink. I have priced the replacement cartridge, which costs about $35.00. That is $3.50 per photo and I would not recommend that horrible price to anyone. I will certainly not buy a replacement at that price for only 10 photos !! Forget this photo printer, and go to an online photofinisher. The online prints are about 15 cents per copy."
1,Watch what you buy,"I ordered the printer and am happy with it, but the paper Amazon suggested does not fit the printer. They should have known better.Kodak EasyShare G600 Printer Dock"
4,Very good product,"A very good price on a great product. And fast shipping too. Only con I see is that the package was quite beat up by the time it got to me. Of course I realize that Amazon is not responsible for the trip, but it needs a little extra cushioning. Will be ordering again though."
5,the learning company,"I am an elementary school teacher and have four of my own kids. I have used many of the learning company's titles in my home and in my classroom and they are excellent. Reader Rabbit 1St Grade is very well done, teaching beginning reading skills, phonics, and sentence structures. A very good investment for your child."
2,Reader Rabbit 1st grade,I enjoyed the graphics but it just didn't capture the kids' attention. Reading a regular book was more effective and enjoyable for all.
2,Not very challenging...,"My daughter graduated from Kindergarten yesterday and today is the first day of summer vacation..so we got out this game and were prepared for a summer full of learning from this game.My kid figured it out in less than 2 hours.If it said this was for beginning Kindergarteners, I would love it...but it's way too far below someone going into 1st grade."
3,Started good but Didn't stay there...,"My son and daughter enjoyed the game for a little while, but it did not hold their interest for more than a few days."
3,hydro blast,This is a cheap alternative to a power washer. More of a gimmick than anything else. Decent enough for light work around the house where you don't want to set up or rent a power washer.
5,Needed some socks and I'm glad I bought these,Fit well and are holding up after a few washings without any shrinkage. Comfortable as I am on my feet most of the day at work. Happy with my purchase.
1,Poor Poor Poor,"We were taught Pro E 2000i2 with this book, and I am sure it was not meant to for that purpose. It is hard to follow and it needs more in-depth explanations of commands. We taught ourselves more from trial and error than this book could hope to deliver. (The reason I am searching for a better book now) The author is very biased, Pro E is not user friendly, and I have a few more headaches. (not entirely the books/authors fault) I'm really glad the company wasted their money on it and not me. I am certain there are better books for 2000i2 out there. A complete novice will more than likely get some usefull info from it, but not 60 bucks worth. :-("
1,Poor Poor Poor,"We were taught Pro E 2000i2 with this book. I learned more from trial and error than I did with this book.

2,should have been better,"As a beginner, this is what i expect in a book: different types of detailed examples covering the numerous commands the are frequently encountered in Part, Assembly, and Drawing modes - simple enough, right?. I've had difficulty just patterning a feature around a circular part, and this book didn't help much. Well, I cant be all that negative because I am a novice at this but, so far so average...or maybe my bias comes out of the fact that pro-e isn't as user friendly which is no fault of the author..."
2,Text corrupted by modernization,"It's fine, to a point, to modernize spellings of certain words, provided it doesn't alter the pronunciation (changing ""Sion"" to ""Zion"" is a no-no). However, the editors of this volume have also chosen to modernize punctuation to the point that it screws up the rhythm. For example, the contraction ""th'Aonian mount"" that appears in the opening of Paradise Lost becomese ""the Aonian"", as if modern readers wouldn't be able to figure it out on their own. This kind of meddling adds extra syllables to lines, screwing up Milton's metre and also insulting the intelligence of readers. If you want a really fine edition, shell out some extra cash for the Hughes volume."
5,"The greatness of Milton ""They also serve who only stand and wait""","Milton's greatness is evident not only in his greatest work 'Paradise Lost' but also in 'Samson Agonistes' and the finest elegy in the language , "" Lycidas"".It is present in his sonnets and shorter pieces also , and "" On His Blindness"" is one of the great poems of world - literature.Milton is a poet of the ear, and there is a powerful music in his verse. His tremendous learning may complicate his poetry for the modern reader, but there are depths in his lines for those who truly probe them."
2,Warriors Challenge IFC,The fighters don't get to show their skills as efficient as they were expected to. Don't waste your money.
3,Easy plot led to boredom.,"The plot was too easy here. The author generally writes well, but her style could be improved. I was entertained, but not to the point where I would consider the author a good crime novelist. I would not recommend this book, because there are too many other fiction-crime novels that are more enjoyable reads."
2,Extremely predictable.,"It was a quick read, but didn't stimulate much thought. The mystery man and the murderer were very easy to pick out early on. While descriptions of work in the DA's office are interesting, character and plot development need work. Over-romanticized the island, too. Good first start for a non-writer, though."
2,Boring,"This is the first book that I have read by Ms. Fairstein. I found myself extremely bored with this book. It was very descriptive but for me too much so and when I say descriptive I am talking about the setting. I don't need to know that the handrail was brown, the building was red brick or how many steps Alex walked up ( Yes - I am exaggerating! ). I skimmed through at least one third of the book because for me it read, ""blah, blah, blah..."" I did like the ending but wish it would've ended much sooner."
2,I had it figured out on p. 72.,"While the idea behind this book is a good one, I think the author needs more practice in characterization. The main character is a strong woman in every aspect; she then falls apart when someone she doesn't even like is murdered. She is also way too dependent on her boyfriend. Her personality conflicts all over the place. It doesn't help that the criminal and motive are easily spotted on page 72.With a little more experience in writing complex plots and and characters, I think the author will develop into someone to look for"
3,A Good First Novel,"The author did a great job of making you think about who the killer might be. She varied the storyline back and forth between suspects and made it appear as though any one of them could have done it. As Alex tries to help find out who killed her friend, famous actress Isabelle Lascar, her own life is put in jeopardy as the killer targets Alex next."
1,Poorly written,"Am I the only one that has a problem with the way the 2 main characters speak to each other? They apparently have known each other for numerous years and are supposedly close friends. Why then, when they are the only 2 people in a room and are speaking only to each other, does the author write the conversations using the character's names in just about every sentence? I don't know about most folks, but when I am speaking to a friend I don't need to say their name at the beginning of each sentence. It just got on my nerves - and I never finished the book. I ordered this for my Kindle - and learned a valuable lesson.....always take advantage of the free samples!"
2,"Fair story, poor prose","I would have found this story of mystery and murder more engrossing if Fairstein's prose had been less murky, and the dialog less stilted. Conversations read like narrative, and it was often difficult to figure out who was speaking. The overall tone, even given the hard-boiled prosecutor and seen-it-all detectives, was flat and expressionless. With all the tightly written, literate crime novels out there, I wouldn't be inclined to try Ms. Fairstein's works again."
2,OK first effort,"I bought and read this book under the premise that an expert in the field of legal crime was taking a step to bring her accumen to the world of fiction. I was somewhat disappointed. The main plot itself is mundane and cliched. The sidetrips into other cases are interesting to a point but not eye-opening like a Patricia Cornwell. The supporting cast needs fleshing out. Beyond Chapman, the cop sidekick, you never really get a feel for the other folks; to the point that you need to review occasionally to differentiate between a friend and a secretary. I'm interested enough to take a look at her two other novels, but I can't heartily endorse her work based on this first effort."
1,i had to push myself to finish this book!,"The book kept getting side tracked on other things. The main storyline wasn't bad but we don't need to know who ate what and when on every page and other detours. It gets annoying and made this book not be as enjoyable as it could be. If this was her first book I had read I wouldn't read any more of hers. Thankfully, I read entombed first which is 10 times better."
4,enjoyable and easy read,"This book was my first introduction to Linda Fairstein. I'm more of a Patricia Cornwell fan. Overall, the book reminded me of tv shows Law & Order SVU and CSI. I had a hard time getting into the book at first, but quickly eased into Linda's writing style. The story flowed pretty quickly and smoothly, although the main character came across a little ""dim-witted"" between the middle and end of the book. The only odd thing I've noticed about Linda's books is that they aren't listed in order from book to book. I had to go to her web site to make sure I followed the proper order."
2,Gag!,"Flat dialog, melodramatic scene descriptions, and horribly read (I listened to the audio tape--a 10 cent purchase from our downtown library). Started the audio book while on a short road trip (yeah, thanks to the recession, we're still driving old cars with built-in cassette decks) and I was thankful for the concrete median, since there were times in the story I would have preferred slamming into the grill of an oncoming semi. To be fair, I finished the story while making a number of short trips while in town, so when I say that the story at times meandered it may be my own disjointed listening sessions. This book was pretty lame and has not inspired me to seek out other books by the author or dip deeper into the series of which this book is one."
5,Love the Alex Cooper Crime Novel Series,"Alex, Mike, and Mercer are such engaging characters. Real life issues that are dealt with day to day on a professional level. I'm working my way through the entire series."
5,better than I exptected,"I picked this up in the hospital and read it because there were no other options in the book shelves there. However, I am glad I did. I actually enjoyed the book. I can usually figure out the twists before they come, but not this time. The ending was perfect!"
3,Thin story with gobs of uninteresting extras,"The plot was interesting, but apparently because there wasn't very much of it there was a lot of extra details about anything and everything tangentially associated with the story line thrown in to meet the page requirements. This extraneous info might have been interesting if it were interestinly presented, but it was not."
5,Slim was awesome,"Amazing compilation of early 50's sides featuring Matt Murphy on guitar. These recordings were relatively unavailable for years, and are a must for every blues/R&B-lover;'s collection.It's interesting to compare these with his later ""Folk Festival"" persona -- these sides rock!"
4,a tour de force on the subjective/objective dichotomy,"One of the core issues of philosophy for Nagel is understanding the relationship between subjective and objective points of view. This book is a penetrating exposition of his thoughts on this subject. Following the trail of this theme through the mind-body problem, metaphysics, philosophy of science, and ethics, Nagel shows us the tremendous rewards of striving for the objective, while recognizing that the subjective always remains with us and cannot be rationalized away. It is a provocative read for someone who is already concerned with this problem, but not for newcomers to philosophy."
3,ONE MORE MISSION: Oliver North Returns to Vietnam,"I agree with all of the other reviews on this page; Oliver North certainly was not in Vietnam very long, but his co-author David Roth certainly represents well the time he did spend as a Marine platoon leader. The accounts are vivid and help to portray Marine combat infantrymen experiences in I-Corps. The book did help me to format my story of flying UH-1D helicopters in the Mekong Delta; I liked the set-up of the chapters and untilized this aspect. I wasn't too interested in the Christianity thing North gets into on his return trip; it certainly is true that this is what has anchored his life--but this is not much of a Vietnam vet story. It still is on my bookshelf, however, for the reasons expressed below by the other reviewers."
2,Practically no bass,"... no matter what you pay, these are cheap-sounding speakers. No bass sound whatsoever, even after tweaking my sound card settings. They sound basically like what comes in a cheap radio.My coworker's PC has a pair of JBL Pro speakers on her PC; maybe I got spoiled listening to her speakers, but it's amazing how thin the Cyber Acoustics speakers sound compared to the JBL. I'm going to return these. Since I'm not going to be happy with ""cheap"" speakers I decided to pay a little more and get a different brand of speakers that are slightly higher priced (and better reviewed).One good thing I can say, is there doesn't seem to be much distortion with the Cyber Acoustics. Also the headphone jack on the front is convenient. And as other reviews of C.A. speakers have pointed out, the blue light on the front IS cool!"
1,Not even better than no speakers at all.,"I'm building a system from scratch, and I'm on a budget. I got these speakers because I just need something simple for sound. I tried them out on a system that I have already. With these plugged in and the computer on, even if the computer is not in use, they randomly make a loud static sound (sounds just like someone is messing with the speaker plug where it goes into the computer). I checked all connections, disconnected and reconnected several times, to no avail. I also noticed that they sometimes caused distortion on my computer monitor - the monitor worked flawlessly both before having these speakers, and after getting rid of them. I would recommend not having ANY speakers before I recommend buying these."
2,A decent cheap solution - if you can bare some of the nuances,"Several years back, I was using these daily for music, movies, and all purpose use for my PC.I'm really surprised how cheaply made these are, considering there are available at big retailers like office depot. In any case, sound is decent, with a lack of bass. Unfortunately, when other signals like cell phone calls interupt, there is a loud buzzing noise. You get used to it, but it's a nuance that can get very annoying.As for the power button and volume, it's cheaply made because they have jammed and gotten stuck several occasions.This is product is extremely cheap and a bearable step up from laptop or monitor speakers, but only slightly better. But for just a few bucks more, there are several good models like theLogitech S220 2.1 Speaker System with Subwoofer.Good luck and cheers."
1,Tinny sound,"Basically, no bass. Music (even cuts which had no bass component) sounded just plain wrong. If you don't care about sound quality at all, then, yeah -- they work. Otherwise: avoid."
3,Garland Wilson- One of the Great Forgotten Piano Players!,"Garland Wilson was an amazing piano player. He very well should be remembered. But there was so many great piano players at the time, He had to play in the shadows of them, and got more acclaim in Europe. I brought this originally because of Nina Mae McKinney's singing. Her singing and his piano player blends beautifully. I wish they would of recorded some more together. But as I listened to some of his other songs he plays piano on, its great. He plays good fast or slow, he can ballads, blues, romantically. I recommend ""Get Up, Bessie"" and Nina Mae's singing along with Garland Wilson playing ""Minnie The Moocher's Wedding Day"" and ""Rhapsody In Love""."
4,HELPPP anyone???,"I am impressed with most of the songs on the CD but there is this song that plays in the movie where madison(the blonde girl) is making out with Ben's friend, the other swimmer, Josh. The song is a slow one, performed by a female solist. It's not included in the soundtrack I guess. Anyone knows the name of the song?"
1,slow down artist,"the artist for the song slow down in Wayne, i went crazy looking for it too but finally....hopefully this helped"
3,For those of you still wondering...,The song playing in the car while Josh and psycho girl are making out is called Falling from Grace by The Gentle Waves.
3,Decent repair manual but not comprehensive,"This book does a decent job of getting you started in bicycle repair. However, I find that it still leaves me a bit confused on certain procedures. I think a good repair manual should have plenty of pictures, which I think this one does not. Many of the pictures in this book are of older, outdated equipment. While this may have been acceptable in 1994, equipment and technology changes require that a repair manual keep up with those changes. I should be able to make most repairs using this manual, but I would pass this one over if you want a truly up-to-date manual that makes bicycle repairs easy to understand."
4,Worked Wonders With Vocals,"I was really impressed with the mixing,even though the cd starts kind of sharp with no intro. Even though Im not a big vocal fan, the selection of tracks were beautiful and at the same time provided a resonating hard beat.From an aspiring DJ toMany...Good Job, I own itand love it. DJ Chris D"
3,The Success Journey,"I respected the author's views on success and appreciated his proven track record.The book contains several quotes that served to drive home the author's key points.I would have liked more specific instructions and techniques to achieving success; monetarily, emotionally, and spiritually.Overall, definitely worth the purchase price and time to read.May I recommend my book?:Prosperity for Life: Masters of Prosperity Give You the Keys to the Life of Your Dreams"
5,Very convient to use,"Having seen a cranberry jelly recipe I wanted to try, I used the liquid as the recipe called for. It was much easier to pour out of the packet, than to mix the powder."
4,Little speakers,Doesnt have much base but for the size and what I paid for the product you cant beat the quality.
1,Very bad interference,Pro- powered by USBCons- speakers interfere very badly with my 5.8GHz home phone. The phone gets so much static that it is unusable.- the sound in one of the speaker gets very distorted sometimes
3,not what i expected,"the USB cable provides the power only. the sound still comes through a separate ""headphone jack"" cable. i was trying to get around a defective sound card with these. so i have to return them."
2,You Get what you Pay for,"I purchased these speakers because after switching out monitors, I found that the speakers I was using were integrated into the monitor and the monitor was also its power source. Faced with the prospect of adding one more plug to an already dubious electrical setup, I looked for some USB speakers that didn't require their own power source.Having to choose between an expensive pair or these...thrift won out.The speakers have an ok sound, don't expect to be blown away by any means. But the easy to use power button and volume controls are a plus, as well as a small footprint, helpful with a cluttered desk.Unfortunately, if my cell phone is within about 6 feet of the speakers, they go crazy with static. This is annoying enough to drive me to stay away from Cyber Acoustics products in the future.BOTTOM LINE: Cheap, small speakers good for those who need a plug-free option. However, interference from other electronics is a near deal-breaker."
1,bad sound at low volume,"The speakers are relatively nice, but when you turn down the volume, they give out a very annoying ""buzz"" and intermittent high-pitched beeps. Theses sounds are not that loud, but were sufficiently noticable that I could not work with the speakers on my desk.I imagine this is an artifact of a cheap amplifier circuit. The sound artifacts come through the headphone jack as well."
1,Complete Crap... stay away,"These are horrible speakers, nothing but static no matter where they are placed. I needed speaker for a week or two until I moved, and these are useless. I will be throwing them away and going without.Jeff"
2,You get what you pay for,"There is a reason these speakers cost so little. The sound quality is horrible. The amount of static that comes out of these speakers is inexcusable. The issue is not an isolated one either. The company I work with ordered these in bulk and the static is the rule...lack of static is the exception. Buyer beware, the low price of the speakers should give you an idea of their quality. The Blue LED power light is indeed nice looking as others have stated."
1,"Static, interference, totally not worth it","The design of these speakers is nice -- they're fairly small and simple, and were really exactly what I was looking for. The main problem is, when they're on, whether or not they are supposed to be projecting sound, they make static/interference type noises, which is incredibly annoying. Before returning them, I just kept them off most of the time. Also annoying is the bright blue, distracting light that automatically comes on when the power is on. Don't waste the money on these."
3,Speakers,These speakers are not bad for the price just be aware that the wires often short out with devices made like this
3,Does the job,"I bought these speakers for my folks in India so that I wouldn't have to deal with 110v/220v conversion headaches. I assume anyone traveling abroad would like to buy these as well instead of a powered speaker. For someone who was looking for a barebones speaker, this does the job well. The sound quality is acceptable, though you can forget getting any bass out of the speakers. Otherwise music played through sharp and clear."
1,Not USB Speakers,If you think these things are USB speakers - think again. They only get power from the USB port. You still have to plug them into the headphone jack on the computer.
5,well worth the money!,i purchased 2 sets -- one for work & one for home. it was a great buy for the money. i searched locally and major retail stores charged me over $20 on these speakers. this is well worth the money i paid for.
4,Nice inexpensive speakers,I have two pairs of these speakers. One for at home and one for at work. With the power coming from the USB it is one less clunky plug I have to find room for on the power strip. The sound is fair. I have no problems with humming or picking up static. While it is very minor I also like the blue power light.Update November 7th 2008After 4 years these speakers are still working great.
1,Barely usable in a modern office,"I purchased 3 pairs for an office to be shared by 3 people (myself and 2 others). The only criteria was cheap, headphone jack and decent looking, and these fit the bill, except...Like others here, the USB power method seemed like a good idea to save plug usage. It may be a good ""idea"", but as some others have noted, the implementation of the idea is fatally flawed.There's a HUGE amount of noise using headphones and a 5.8GHz cordless phone on the same desk causes an irritating tone when in use that only stops by turning the speakers off.Very disappointed so hopefully they can be returned despite 2 with no packaging."
2,"Nice speakers, but not shielded","Sound quality is good and installation is easy, but 2.4Ghz cordless phone caused interfearance."
1,You get what you pay for,"I'm not the type of person who is picky about sound quality, so I figured it wouldn't matter if I got cheap speakers. Boy, was I wrong. These buzz and aren't even worth listening to. Their best feature is the blue LED power light. You'd be better off plugging a pair of cheap dollar headphones into the back of your computer. You've been warned. I wish someone had told me."
1,Do yourself a favor don't buy these speakers,Do yourself a favor spend another 10 dollars and buy another pair of speakers. These are awful! It is my opinion they should not even be sold. I can honestly say that the old transistor radio has better sound than these so called stereo speakers. Amazon did the right thing and refunded the order but the company that makes these should really be ashamed to have their name associated with these so called speakers.
4,Nice sound but low peak volume,"These speakers just plugged in and worked but the sound level is not sufficient for a very large area. If you need personal sound and are going to be very near to the speakers, these will do nicely."
3,"Not too bad, but not too good","Pros:- Don't take up too much space.- Pretty good bass.- Portable.Cons:- Bad treble.Overall, these speakers will work just fine for the computer, but if for using special things with them, you may want to consider because of the unclearness of treble due to the minimum buzz in the speakers. Well, you get what you pay for."
2,Cheap comes at a price,"I concur with the other reviews. These speakers are just ok. I would never have purchased them if they were going on my desk at home. However that being said, they are perfect for work. They are cheap and they at least work well enough to listen to music.The feedback/buzzing can be annoying at times, but on the plus side, I know when my cell phone is about to ring.If you are considering these for any other reason, spend more money on them and get a better pair."
2,Did not work as well as I thought they would!!,The speakers did not work very well at all!! It makes a buzzing sound as soon as I plug it in!!
3,so-so,It doesn't really get loud but for the price its ok. I do hear a static sound though when I put headphones.
3,Replalcement Speakers,"Not exactly what I thought it was. I wanted to get rid of the wall wart, but I was also thinking I was getting rid of the audio cable."
2,Europop-Ragga Cover-Versions,"Last year they had a good summer hit in Germanywith a new version of ""Never gonna break my stride"". A weaker version of ""Do you really want to hurt me"" ruined that success. Currently they are trying it again with ""Heartbreaker"". Basically it is a Europop-ragga project that only exists on cover versions. They were probably surprised by their own success."
5,My grandson and Billy,"My grandson liked Billy. He wanted a real baby goat, so this little served the purpose. He sleeps with it."
5,Chokmah,"I think its a wonderfull album.I love the lyrics! Even my two kids (10 +12) like to sing her songs loud in our New Jersey home. For us it is a piece of Germany in the States. For me she is like an old friend that I love to meet ever once in a while and see how she develops.Maybe its because she is a perfect example of our Generation of German Women and I agree with every little line of her songs.Particularly after the events of the 11.Sept 2001 her song""Dafuer ist das Leben zu kurz"" means a lot to me!Take care!"
1,Painting the Black..... Another great read!,"Since I loved ""On the Devils Court"" so much as an adolescent, I thought it fitting to read one of Deukers other novels now that I am a bit older. I was not dissapointed. Baseball, and all sports have always been an important part of my life so this book really appeals to me. Ryan Ward is the kind of kid that I can relate too. For personal, and health reasons Ryan quit baseball when he was young, but after he meets his new neighbor during his senior year in school he decides to go out for the team. Although his friendship with his new neighbor is downright unstable at times, He brings about a spark in Ryan that he hasnt had otherwise. I think this is a good book for a young person to read especially someone who thinks that they cant do something for whatever reason. The book has other issues besides baseball that will keep you interested, I read it in one day! Deuker does it again!"
4,A hero's fall from grace,"F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote, ""show me a hero and I'llwrite you a tragedy"".Josh is certainly a local hero, as heleads his high school to great things on the athletic fields, but his personality and character are on the edge, and sometimes over the edge.I grew up with the idea that leaders, whether they be in the classroom or on the ballfield had to have a clean slate when it comes to your character, perhaps this book is making a societal statement that things have changed. We read about college and even high school athletes who have had run-ins with the law and they are freed to continue to play and to cause more ills.What a shame...despite the horrible feeling I got as I read about Josh the book is a quick fast read, that will lure you in and keep you turning pages faster than a Randy Johnson fastball.Enjoy...also try _Heart of a Champion_ by Deuker, and _ Bull Catcher_ by Alden Carter."
4,This is a sport related book filled with drama.,"PAINTING THE BLACK-Carl Deaker Houghton Mifflin Company 1997 PP. 248Life has been rough for Ryan Ward all his life. Every time he gets good at something, everything falls apart. Then Josh moves in. Josh is the kind of guy who will be your best friend one day and ignore you the next, but during his friendship with Ryan he teaches him to love baseball, and because of his friendship with Josh, Ryan gets really good at it. This book is based around baseball, but there is more to it than sports. It covers many important issues. Carl Deaker really seems to bring his characters to life.Drama Reviewed by Laura Wedell"
2,Too big and heavy,"I thought they had sent me a Mans Watch. Although it feels and looks good, very classy its simply too big. After rechecking the product description I think this is more of a unisex watch than a womans. The description should state such.The outer diameter of 31mm is 10mm larger than my timex indiglo and 12mm larger than my mid-range seiko. Its actually larger and heavier than my husbands everyday timex watch."
4,A good read,"I had previouly read another book about Clara Harris. The other book was a lot longer with more details"" Out of control"".I recieved this book today and finished it already. I enjoyed it even though I didn't learn much of anything I wasn't already aware of."
5,Ruth Ives artwork is magical...,"I agree with Rebecca - I, too, read this version of Cinderella when I was young and have always thought Ives' artwork was the very best! Sometimes I feel rather ""Disney'd-out"" and sad that it is nearly the only artwork several generations have known for some of the old fairy tales. I hope many others will find this version and be able to love and appreciate it."
5,replacment rocker switch,I was verry pleased with the switch I recieved it conected to the existing wires with out any problems it works easier than the original and has a rubber cover wich will keep out the mud and water wich I believe was the cause of the failier of the original . It also came with extra hardware and such that would alow you to use it in different aplications . I thought the price was a little high but the switch was exactly what I needed and I feel that the improvements they have made to it will make it outlast the original by a long shot .
2,Don't buy this cheese on line,"I once bought this cheese from a high-end cheese store in the San Francisco area and it was the best cheese I had ever eaten -- crumbly, fragrant of earth and (for some reason) oranges, a deep complex flavor that just kept on giving. I hunted for it in Los Angeles, couldn't find it, finally tracked it down on line at igourmet. What I got was like so-so parmesan: hard and a little oily with no particular flavor. To igourmet's credit, they apologized and gave me a full refund, so I don't blame then. I've since read that the cheese is fragile and very hard to find in its best state, even in Italy. If you love good cheese, put in the effort to find a cheese store that carries this cheese at its best. Unforgettable. But don't try to buy it on line."
3,Very similiar to a vegetarian cookbook...,"This book has a lot of good recipes. Unfortunately, I am not convinced the recipes were designed for vegetarians. Many of the recipes have ingredient lists like ""Fish sauce (or light soy sauce)"".Apart from that, book has lots of pretty pictures, is well organized and has most of the Thai food that vegetarians would order in a restaurant (curries, pad thai, pineapple fried rice). No Drunken Noodle though!"
4,"Pungent, , Exotic, and EASY","Interesting combinations, easy to understand, easy to find ingredients (well, in Toronto's Chinatown it is). Try the Spiced Corn Cakes with Cucumber Dipping Sauces and the Hot and Sour Thai Soup,and the Golden Spring Rolls."
4,Great Veggie Thai!,"I just wanted to say to anyone who thinks this was not meant for veggies, should have read the intro. The Author explains how to substitute, say fish sauce, with light soy or other kinds of combinations to achieve the same flavors. The Pad thai is wonderful as well as the stir-fry's and soups. I recommend you at least try it on for size"
3,A little complicated...,"This book offers some tasty recipes and sauces, but a lot of the recipes are a little complicated. They have too many ingredients and are time consuming. I only use the recipes for the sauces (the sweet chili sauce is especially tasty and great for dipping veggies or spring rolls)."
2,good starting point,"I watched this special when it premiered on the History Channel. It was good as a piece which can begin a dialogue or provoke thoughts, but is scant on actual determinations or even set theories. This is not something which gives you a good handle on what is believed around the world regarding these theories, and is much too vague. You also get the sense that Dan Brown did not do enough proper research in writing this book, as evidenced by his numerous historical mistakes."
3,Wishy-washy -- Louis J Sheehan,"There is no proof of the links in ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail,"" and there is no proof that there aren't links. Pass on this one. Louis J Sheehan"
1,Not worth the plastic it's stored on,"To be honest, I've never been that impressed by the kind of programmes the History Channel puts out - too much emphasis on entertainment and not enpough on decent research, historical accuracy, etc. So it was no big surprise to find this programme seriously ""skewed"", as a previous reviewer put it.This is a thoroughly lacklustre product which suffers from the same shortcomings that I already mentioned.So rather than waste my time and yours reviewing something that isn't worth watching in the first place I just want to direct your attention to ""The Real Da Vinci Code"" released in May this year (2006).It still isn't the definitive investigation - you'd need more than a couple of hours to cover all the relevant topics, but it has this offering seriously outclassed in every department- even as straight forward entertainment!"
1,Bad,"This film repeats the basic premise over and over and over..it was so bad that I really couldn't believe it.The narrator talks about the holy grail being not a cup but Mary Magdeleine being the grail that carried not the blood of Jesus but the unborn child.It says she went to Egypt where she raised her child.Then is states that Davinci painted clues into his 'Last Super' which pints to the true relationship between Mary and Jesus. It speaks about the 325 AD council of Nicea and about the Sang Graal , dadocument which supossedly explains the true history of the christian faith.IThis poor documentary reapest the same footage almost all the way through this film..we hear the same quotes over and over.."
3,For a short...its not bad.,"You gotta give the creators of this movie some credit. They gave you the run down of the story within the two characters... Tweedle Dum and Marisa Tomei wannabe. Its not bad for a short, I wouldn't buy it, and I wouldn't see it ever again, but I would recommend for watching once in your lifetime, to get an idea for starters in the Independent Movie filmaking process. Its good for a beginner, its bad if you think you;re gonna be a star. The best part is when the two siblings start shooting down like a mafia movie in a western. Angela got smooth karate chop kicks and her Sally got two glocks underneath his armpits. Sally knows how to hold them, but he sure can't shoot straight, hehe."
2,"Great Sound, but Awkward","The speakers on this product are great, but the light/magnifier component is awkward to use, distorting, and not very sturdy."
5,Awesone NO FAN switch !,"I had the Netgear GS116 Gigabit switch and after 1-2 years some ports started acting strangely. After I looked high and low for a switch I almost gave up and wanted to order the same GS116 when I found this.The most important thing for me was 16+ ports with no fan because this is in the room I sleep. Besides this model and the GS116 I belive all switches have fans.The switch is awesome. It works well, stays cool enough and provides 24 Gigagbit ports. The only downside is the price but if it lasts me at least 5 years I am OK with that."
1,Worked for a few months before multiple failures,"Well, things started off pretty good with a decent picture day and night, but after 3-4 months, the night vision failed to work. After another month, the day vision only worked in black and white. After another month (it was mid-winter by now) the day vision only worked if the temperature was above about 35 degrees outside. In Kentucky 35 is a ""warm"" day in the winter. I'm giving up on this thing and trying the more expensive Q-See camera."
4,"Good Camera, but...","I was surprised at the picture you get off this thing. I figured for ~$75 how good could it be?Well, I'd say pretty darn good. I can honestly say I could not expect better picture quality fora sub-$100 camera. However the night vision part is where it falls short... It's not 45 feetmore like 25, But thats still pretty good. Within that 25 feet, people light up like the 4th of Julyyou can't miss em.The picture in night vision mode is kinda grainy, but almost all night vision I have ever seen isto some degree or another.If you're looking for a low-cost camera that has 'ok' night vision capabilities, then this will definetlyfit the bill."
1,Fire Hazard,"When I opened the box and started to put the camera components together I smelled the tell-tale odor of an electrical short circuit. As the power cord exits the transformer to power the camera, the insulation was torn allowing the cooper to be exposed. This allowed the two wires to cross and short circuit. I contacted the manufacturer and they sent me a new transformer. This one also had the cooper exposed as it exited the strain relief. I contact them again, they sent another transformer that had the same manufacturing flaw. They seemed to have drawn the line at replacing the faulty transformer only twice. This is the response I got from Daniel P at customer support:""I have been informed that all the adapters for this product will have some copper coil that is visible through slots in the actual adapter.""Evidently they don't understand that the cooper that's exposed is outside the protection of the transformer case making this a fire hazard."
4,Surprisingly effective,"Has a very good range. Had it covering a large room as a nanny cam. The only problem is the IR LEDs make it obvious that there's a camera there because they turn red in the dark. Maybe that would be good for someone setting a security system as a deterent, but I wanted something a little more inconspicuous."
2,Camera is OK,"Camera has ok picture quality, but you will not be reading a license plate more than 40' away. My only complaint is that it does not seem to work when the temp gets below about 27F.Well, the camera just started crapping out at night. I think I'll drop it a star."
2,Hi-Res SVAT CV31,"Good Resolution in day and full color, it have low quality in the night, not see detail of faces of citizens at 15m. Easy install, only maybe need software for edit or capture video, for the price."
4,Great,needed to buy a adapter to get it to work with my security system and it was only $4 at radioshack A+ camera but note it doesn't have audio so its ideal for out door use
2,Returned Camera,"I am new to the scurity camera game. I bought several cameras and a Q-see DVR to see how I would like to setup my system. The only other camera I had seen was a Lorex 600TVL system. I bought the SVAT CV31 because of the reviews and the price. When I recieved the camera I noted how cheap it felt. Another reviewer commented it felt hallow that is a great description. The real issue is that the image quality. Everything is fuzzy. There is no way that I could make out any facial features. Cars that pass could be seen, but not easily identified. I know you pay for what you get, but this camera at 420tvl is just not worth installing. I am returning today. Spend a little more money and get a better camera. I guess if you just want a picture this camera would work thats why i'm not giving it 1 star."
5,100% Satisfied,i purchased these before and i loved them they work great day and night. i came across these they are cheaper than the ones i purchased before. i bought two and im going to buy another one. A++++
3,Better than my expensive ones but only last one year.,"Excellent, honestly. Night vision, without lighting,is very good. It's a large camera, but that fine with me. I can see farther away with a wider angle than with my $115 each installed cameras or the CV65 which is practically useless at night. If I had purchased this camera before the others, I would have bought six of these. If you don't mind the size, it is highly recommended by me--I don't recommend many products. Aug 8, 2010, After one year rolling lines and cloudy view. Does not compare to the more expensive ones--They are still vivid. Get an extended warranty if you desire it."
4,"Good, practical camera","I have had two of these in operation for a year. They are able to handle huge temperature extremes without a hitch. They work best when mounted up high. This illuminates the area w/ the IR. You can also use a dedicated IR illuminator to improve night vision range. I recommend this camera, especially since the price has come down $25."
3,Up and running,"Installed camera today or should say replacement camera. First one worked about 3 seconds before failing perhaps to a defective power supply. But Amazon stood by their sale and replaced unti within a week.I have purchased a SVAT wireless cam previously which as functioned well for about a year now. But I wanted something with a bit more clarity and durability. Resolution for this price point is adequate with excellent color reproduction and a very good lens coverage. Haven't tested IR but if it's comparable to the other SVAT product line, it should also be adequate for my needs."
3,security camera,"Camera provides a clear, sharp picture, good field of view, but does not appear to be in color, as it is advertized. Night vision is fair. Extra night illumination would help. Also note, there is no audio. All in all, not bad for the price, but i should have paid extra for a camera with audio."
5,Gift,This product was purchased as a gift for my brother in law after a car vandal briefly terrorized their neighborhood. He was very excited. I can tell you very little about the item other than it seemed to be fairly easy to install and he seems to be very pleased with it. He seems particularly pleased with the night vision.
4,Good picture for the price,"I bought a cv65 lower price only 320 lines, and the cv31 side by side.What a difference. The cv31 is bright sharp, nice wide lens. I gave it a 4 because of the mount. As others have said, I found out. Hard to lock into place, not really a nut to tighten. Maybe there is a cap on the nut, I will play with it some more. It needs a better mount. The picture shows the correct mount that came with my camera.I have not tried it at night yet, but I wanted to write a review. I always read the reviews, and go by them. You guys were right again.Great camera for price. Also comes with cable, power supply.I will buy another one of these cv31 cameras.Frank"
2,Sherlock Holmes Books on Disc,"Edward Hardwicke is the perfect narrator for the Holmes series--excellent performances 5 stars. However, Amazon has a great deal of duplication of content in CD Sherlock Holmes different titles for the packages. I found it maost annoying that have now purchased several duplicate stories in order to get a the ones I want--Zero stars."
4,A Refreshing Change,"It made me yearn for a new BTS album, but it's a terrific holdover. It starts strong, and ends even better, with a few forgetables in the middle. A solid solo offering."
5,Heir apparent to Neil Young,"Taking a break from BTS (please ignore those who think that just because a band member does a solo album, the band is over), Doug produces a masterful, far reaching album. The comparisons with Niel Young's work could go on and on (including Neil's alternating work with and without Crazy Horse). . . but I'll finish by saying that Doug, with this effort, has charted a course that appears will be as illustrious and Neil's."
5,blah blah blah.....just get it already!!!,"Listen! If you like BTS then just get this. It's certainly NOT BTS but I really love this cd. It's a gem unto itself. I'm actually very happy Doug decided to go off and do this solo. It just shows a different side to Doug, who is essentially BTS."
3,not up to Built To Spill's par,Songs one through four are excelent. They truly display Doug Martsch's intracate slide guitar playing with Doug's layered vocals adding that Built To Spill feel. Unfortunately good songs are not consistant throughout this record. I bought this record anticipating Built To Spill's usual consistancy of good songs mixed properly throughout the record to provide a listening experiance with flow. Too often I find myself skipping through this record to hear the songs I want hear.
4,not blind willy martsch,"It took a couple years to get this released for some reason, but although the songs were etched in 1999-2000 and didn't see record store bins until 2002, it's nice and fresh and springy sounding.Martsch has modified some blues techniques to fit his playing style, but has not really released an acoustic blues album as many reviews suggest -- this is more like Built to Spill sitting around a campfire. Occasionally, it even sounds reminiscent of Modest Mouse at a barn dance. And that's not a negative thing -- this is a fresher take on acoustic music and slide guitar than the ""genre tribute"" reviews seem to suggest.It goes from intricate to bracing, very much what we've come to expect from this guitar innovator. Recommended."
1,Daryll-Ann is Hollands pride!,"Happy Traum is D-A's first cd to come out in the US, but it their third in The Netherlands. A nice cd with beautifull poppy songs in the tradition of The Byrds, Beatles and CSN&Y. I love it!"
3,Good for the money,"Nice compact unit with a focus I like (turning the whole body). I use a neck strap Cosmos neck strap 36"" and it will change focus while hanging on my neck.pretty fuzzy edges and not super sharp, but for a quick look at ball games in a nice compact package. Won't fit in jeans pocket but fit in cargo pants or light coat pocket.Decent value for the money."
4,Shipped fast in perfect condition. Thank you.,Was a gift for my mother for Christmas for my mother. She enjoys it almost daily watching birds and cars coming up the road a mile away.
4,Vangaurd Dm-6250 Monocular,"I bought this for my husband because we were going on a cruise. Because he is blind in one eye he's not able to get the benefit of a binocular. He found it very good, the magnification was excellent, liked the compact size of it because its easy to pack away and because of its small size, found it very easy to carry around.He gave it 4 stars not 5 because of the silly wrist strap, much too flimsy! and had to buy a better one for around his neck"
2,Clips not strong enough for heavy items,"Style of hanger is very good and space saving. Good if using to hold lightweight items only (slips, shorts, etc.) If item is weightier, need a stronger clip."
1,"Looks Good, but feel Cheap !","Pair of cheap speakers for a high price. Speakers sound tinny with no way to adjust them. Also they are light as a feather, just isn't any ""meat"" to these guys."
2,Ya Get what Ya Pay For,Ok sound as long as you don't bump the speaker. If you bump wires then speakers can go in and out and you have to adjust wires. OK sound ~ Not great ~ Pay more money and get a better one.
4,Very Good Speakers,"The speakers are great for the price. Good range, small foot print, nice looking.Only problem I have is with the vendor. The product image used on Amazon IS NOT the product I received. The image is for the newer model of speakers, which is what I wanted, but the old style speakers were shipped. No biggie. The speakers are great for the price."
2,"Harsh, booming sound over 60% volume - afwful iPod sound when hooked.","I bought them today, hook them up and tried them out with my Realtek HD Audio Manager. Even with numerous adjustments it's below my expectations, specially for $37 (Staples). When I hooked iPod - it's jack on front you have no idea how terrible sound is and how low in Volume. This set is good for news/casual listening but If you look for quality - I'll stick with Creative Labs ( I used 2 sets - one for my husband's computer and one for my laptop and sound is amazing)."
3,CA PC Speaker Review,"These Speakers Are Very Average Sounding... not the Best, Not the Worst. The Volume Knob is Slick and Very Difficult to Turn. They are However, Very Easy to Hook Up."
2,lost sound in one speaker,the speakers sound very good. but after one day i lost sound from the speaker on the blue light side.kind of a bummer but it still sounds good with just the one speaker.
2,Nice sound. Huge piercing noise.,"These have a nice range. Sound is crisp & clear except for this annoying high pitched sound that eminates from them. I tried a ferrite bead and adjusting my software and bios, none of which helped me. I also had a little trouble with the wire -- had lost sound in one speaker 'til I wiggled it again. When headphones are plugged into the jack on the speakers, I can only hear sound out of one earpiece. Am trying to get Amazon to exchange them. Hopefully, it's just a problem with this pair."
4,Great for the price,"I got a nice black record player for Christmas. I adapted the RCA audio jacks to fit my computer speakers which were an old beige color. I recently ordered these so they'd match better and they really are nice looking speakers. They match my record player really well, it looks like they were made for each other. They sound good enough and they were the right price range. They don't get quite as loud as my older speakers, but at that point in volume, my older speakers would start to sound staticy and fuzzy. I'd say these go as loud as they can handle for speakers their size. Any louder and the audio get would ugly.I would recommend these to anybody who wants great looking functional speakers at reasonable price. Nothing super fancy but nothing low quality either. I would definitely buy them again if I ever needed another basic set of speakers."
3,Lacking midrange. OK for $20,"These are OK for light computer use, but music or gaming not so good.One note bass, and little mid range fidelity.I wanted to use these for listening to Rhapsody stream, but ended up getting more expensive ones.No great bargain here, just $20 sound.Just wish they still made those big, cheap speakers that used to be found at computer shows.They sounded like $100 for only 25 bucks.Oh well."
3,Decent for its price,"When I first received these speakers, I was really excited by the chic look to them. It's easy enough to get them hooked up, and it even came with an aux. cord and little stand for my Ipod. Great! The music quality is a decent, balanced sound (which was exactly what I was looking for), but falters when you try to hold conversations (via Skype etc). Occasionally the sound becomes warbled or...muffled, I suppose. I've only had the product for a day, so it's not from wear and tear. This may be simply because it's a cheap set of speakers. Not sure. At any rate, don't expect miracles from this, but they seem to be pretty decent. I'm not sure if the set is worth the price, but I'm also not sure about the average cost of speakers. So, if you're not looking for lots of bass, it's an alright product."
4,A Good Buy,These speakers have good sound and do not distort the sound at high volume levels. Much better sound than I expedted for the money. Well worth the price.
4,Some Interference,"I think these are good sounding speakers overall. They're not expensive and don't take up too much space. I tried out by listening to you-tube videos and did get some static interference. I found it annoying enough that I'm returning. I'm also not into the bright blue light that stays on. Seems people like bright lights on their computers, monitors, speakers, electric toothbrushes, and everything else. I perfer not to have it but thats just me.If your looking for a decent set of speakers for a low price and don't mind some interference these will make the cut."
1,Cant get any worse !!!,Cyber Acoustics CA-2022R 2.0 Computer Speakers- BlackThey are terrible ...1. The bass and speakers starting cracking at 60% volume.2. NO clarity in sound3. The Product Box was not even sealed when I got it4. U CANT BUY ANYTHING WORSE THAN THIS for the priceI would really recommend that if you like music even a wee bit ... please do not buy them.
4,Cyber Acoustics Computer Speakers,"I really like the look of the speakers - just what I was looking for - sleek/modern. They go nice with my system. The only thing I wasn't too happy about was that was that they looked different in the picture. They appear to be more flat on the picture, which is what I was hoping for, but they aren't. Even though they're turned to the side in the pic, you can't see that they do extend farther back. But I'm not sure if they even make them that slim, so I'm keeping them anyway. Oh, and the sound is good too."
3,Fairly Decent Speakers,"I use these at my job, so I don't have the opportunity to really blast them. But they work well and help me enjoy my golden oldies as I work on my computer. I probably could have gotten a cheaper pair, but had a gift certificate and splurged. I'm not a sound snob, so I may not be the best person to judge, but they seem to have a nice sound and the blue light is fun."
3,Alright for the right price.,"These are only a little better than listening to the internal speakers on my iMac. Yes, they can get loud, but the sound quality isn't what I'm used to. It's a good thing I got them fairly cheap."
3,Cyber Accoustics CA-2022,"The speakers are nice, but the sound quality is a little to tinnie sounding. To turn it on the speaker tends to slide , and you end up holding down the speaker so that you can adjust the sound level."
5,Computer Speakers,"These speakers are just fine. Very simple to connect with brief, clear instructions. I needed speakers for an inexpensive 19"" TV that had terrible, almost inaudible, sound even with the volume set to maximum. With the speakers the quality and volume of the sound is very good. The price was reasonable and delivery was great. They arrived a couple days earlier than the estimated delivery date given. These speakers were among the 10 best computer speakers rated by an audio pro on the net. I would buy these again for other equipment and recommend them to others."
3,"Great Speakers, Bad For Headphones","These speakers have very good bass response and clarity. I had hoped to use my headphones with them, too, but there is a very loud electric humming sound through the headphone jack. A coworker bought these same speakers and I found the same thing happening with his, too. Just to be sure, I tested my headphones by plugging them directly into the computer. Indeed, they were working fine on their own. It is just a flaw in the headphone jack circuitry. But again, the speakers themselves sound great!"
1,garbage,"Garbage. Turned up half way things get distorted and poppy. the sound gets loud but, its not clear at all. when ever bass hits, it takes away for the high and mid, it gets lowered. they sound horrible. if this product was $5, i would say u get what you pay for and i would be happy. to pay $20 for this product is absurd. save your money. this product's sound quality is by far the worst i have ever heard on a set of cpu speakers that i bought."
2,"There have to be better cheap computer speakers than these, right?","Needed some computer speakers for the office and didn't want to spend upwards of $150 for small powered monitors so I tried these. Overall, the sound is pretty disappointing and isn't remotely balanced. The highs are over-accentuated. Upper-mids are scooped. Mids sound boxy. Upper-lows are relatively clear but the very low end is pretty much non-existant; to be expected with such small speaker cones. On the upside, these get plenty loud enough for my needs. I didn't expect miracles for $20 but these aren't a whole lot better than the stock speakers on my laptop computer. The search will continue."
2,Speaker catastrophe,"So,I bought these from fry's a few months ago for a good price.I never had a single problem with these speakers, until moments ago, when my speakers suddenly stopped playing music/videos. I've unplugged, and tried continuously, but no such luck.What's killing me is I know they're not blown, because I can hear feedback when I touch the output tip.And I've even tested other headphones, so it's not the computer input.Don't buy this garbage. Save your money."
2,Great price,I love buying at Amazon I always find the best price on the merchandise I want. The sound on the speakers are not so great but I like them anyway.
5,retro art classes at home,great price on a huge collection. DVd's were in great shape packaging was perfect. Shipped in no time with tracking.
3,Bob Ross Joy of Painted Seascape Collection,I bought this item because I thought I might go back to painting but can't remember exactly how I did it before. This item would be better if it included a paper supply list so I don't have to keep rewinding the VCR. BJLee
5,Bob Ross Painting Collection,"My son has watched Bob Ross on tv since he was a small child. At age 39, he has painted his first picture using Bob's techniques. The series are wonderful and I am looking forward to see more of my son's talent coming out on canvas. This was a great buy and quick delivery."
4,"A nice collection of ""pearls of wisdom"" to improve your life",I've read several of Maxwell's books and this is yet another solid effort and a fantastic guide to helping you become a better leader (and parent). I couldn't help but see the parallel between the two while Maxwell states the traits and attributes for great leadership. They are the same traits any wonderful parent should have too. That was the real pearl of wisdom that I got from this book and instead of just wondering how to become a better leader/manager I will use this book to help me become a better parent too.
2,Not the best book on leadership around,"I did not like this book - I found it too generalized and not practical enough. Some of the stories were okay, and it was an easy read, but not actually that helpful. I think it would be been helpful, too, if he had defined his term ""leader""."
5,Audiobook review,This product arrived in a timely manner and in good quality. It is a great addition to a personal development library.
5,Outstanding!,"John C. Maxwell has done it again! Every aspiring leader should own this book. It is relevant for non-profit leaders, for profit leaders, and community/family leaders."
2,Pep Talk,"Definitely easy to read with many stories and acronyms. There were a few golden nuggets in here, but it was mainly inspirational fluff. There were plenty of overgeneralized how-to's, but little was practical for me. I also have a number of questions about his definition of leadership. There are much better books out there."
3,Good but not Great,"I have to admit that I didn't care for this as much as most of John Maxwell's other books. The information is great and there are a lot of points that can be pulled from this, but it just felt like the book was a bunch of lists within lists. It was actually difficult to digest.This is one of those books that you can really only read a few pages at a time instead of trying to take in a bunch in one sitting. But even doing this, you'll find that each list is often accompanied by sub-lists and even sub-lists of sub-lists. Again, all the information is great, but you get lost a bit on what list you're reading.With that said, Developing is still a must-read for any business leader, manager or supervisor. Maxwell provides the framework for not only finding but creating great leaders within your organization. He takes you through the process step by step (and step within step) of why and how to turn your employees into a strong leadership team."
5,Great book,I love doing this class with our students every year. It help us with the leadership skills and helps us get ready for the real world when they leave our program.
5,Here it is! The comprehensive history of particle physics you've been looking for!,"While not for the feint of heart, this exceptionally well-researched tome (clocking-in at over 400 pages) is a must-have for anyone interested in the history of particle physics in the 20th century. Although a bit out-of-date, with virtually no coverage of String theory or competing proposals to merge relativity and quantum mechanics, it is nonetheless a comprehensive narrative up through the ""completion"" of the Standard Model.Perhaps the book's greatest achievement is its ability to move back-and-forth between historical developments within the scientific community and the development of the science itself. With countless interviews and original source materials, Crease & Mann capture the excitement of scientific discovery while giving an excellent layman's overview of those discoveries.This is a compelling read, and highly recommended to anyone interested in this fascinating field."
2,pretty cheap,I knew these were cheap price but they are really cheap quality. the sound is very tinny and over all quality is poor. I would not recommend
4,Good speakers,I spent twice the money at Target for speakers that are equivalent to the Cyber Acoustics. I wish I would have thought about Amazon first as these are as good and the size is much better being smaller. I have recommended Amazon to my friends regarding the speakers.
5,Speakers,Received the speakers as they were described and in a timely manner. I am very pleased with this vendor.
1,Worthless,"Cheap and trash. Be aware that these speakers are USB powered, so you cannot just stick them to any old sound source. Besides, connecting it up to my Airport Express caused it to blicker and buzz in a most alarming way. This was much diminished when I hooked it to my PS2, but persisted nevertheless. And sticking headphones on was a complete disaster - the headphones buzzed like there were angry hornets somewhere..."
2,You get what you pay for...,"I needed cheap speakers for an old, rarely used system - that's what I got. They serve their purpose, but only because they aren't used that often. If you use these everyday the constant buzz will make you crazy."
3,grindfest,The gameplay is like all Tales game. No different.Story lame. Quests are lame as well. You have to grind for parts to craft items.Overall I did not like the game at all. Too much grinding for my liking. Gameplay can get very redundant.Dont recommend unless you are a diehard Tales fan and like to grind alot.
3,Tales games dont disappoint,"If you have played a Tales game then you know what to expect, if you haven't then I would recommend starting elsewhere for your first."
5,Great for teaching reading,My students enjoy this game and are learning to make words at the same time. They are now convinced that you can't make a word without a vowel - a concept that was difficult for them to remember when they were writing.
1,ALMOST WORTHLESS WARRANTY,"Unit is slow to respond to channel changes. When it stopped responding, I was introduced to the ALMOST WORTHLESS WARRANTY. No service centers around the country. No exchange program, even while under warranty and with a credit card. Must be shipped to New Jersey, at customer expense. Customer risks improper packaging being blamed for additional damage. Samsung reps show no concern for customer at all - they seem to think their warranty service policy is OK. After faxing copy of invoice 6 days ago, still no address for return. WILL NEVER, NEVER BUY ANOTHER SAMSUNG PRODUCT."
2,Could be lots better,"A consequence of Samsung's policy of speeding products to market. This box has a mind of its own in deciding and remembering which channels are NTSC and which are DTV -- an opaque process that is hard for the consumer to override or reset. The worst problem is that there is a programming bug in the ASTC mode that Fox used *last year* for ""Widescreen."" (Fortunately, Fox uses real HDTV this year.) The top and bottom of the image were cut off so you lost things like the score on football games. (This is in a mode where, showing a 16:9 image on a 4:3 monitor, there are intentional black bars at the top and bottom of the screen to make the image fit.) The worst part was, after repeated contacts with Samsung North America, it developed that not only was there no firmware update (even though there is a connector on the back for firmware updates), they had no way of even reporting the problem to the engineers in Korea to request a firmware update. Lame. Really, really lame."
2,Look elsewhere,"I've had this unit for about two years, well really I've put up with it for two years. At the time it was released, it was the hottest thing on the market, but it's still junk in my opinion. Slow to change channels, locks up every time I switch to my local CBS station, takes forever to reboot, doesn't lock onto signals as well as my integrated sony set, etc. LG has supposedly got some nice units out these days..."
1,worthless crap,"While this worked, it was difficult to use. only lasted for 6 months then it died. total waste of time and money."
1,Be Wary If It Says Samsung,"I purchased this Samsung Terrestial Receiver several years ago.It performed well until last fall when it stopped working.You could no longer turn it on.When your pressed the power button either by remote control or by pressing the button on the unit it just started ""clicking""!It joined my Samsung DVD Home Theater in the great electronics grave yard.The home theater lasted about the same length of time (maybe 4 years).The only good that came out of these experiences is that I learned not to buy Samsung products in the future.Get me once, shame on me, get me twice shame on you!"
1,Don't waste your time,"The promise of this device is never quite met. When it does work, it switches channels slowly, and the machine easily freezes while compiling the electronic programming guide (they mention this ""feature"" in the manual). But the real deal breaker is the fact the the machine freezes any time it gets a signal it can't handle. My first unit simply halted with the annoying ""HELLO"" message on the front panel. It did not respond to any remote or front panel buttons. Power cycling did no good. The second unit, when it encounted a bad signal would go into a reboot cycle, taking 10-15 seconds to recover. I guess that was suppose to be an improvement. When it finally locked up, I was able to coax it out by flipping the resolution on the back of the box. This definitely would not make for an enjoyable evening of channel surfing in my house! I sent back the second unit as well and am shopping for something better."
1,Piece of Hi-Tech Junk,Straight out of the box this unit kept on crashing and hanging up. Very poor design. Gives false reception information. It is hard to imagine that a company would actually sell a hi-tech component that is so defective at such a high price. Don't waste your money and time on this.
5,The Best!,"I usuall order from another website and am happy to see it available here. I grew up in Rome, Italy and this is the closest to the zampone I ate living there! I buy a few every year to cook for New Years! Delicious over lentils. Traditional New Years fare!"
3,Cooked vs Fresh Cotechino,"Living in Vermont, we can only purchase fresh Cotechino in late November through a local Italian Market that orders from New York city. Of the many different brands that I have purchased from on line sites, I find that this Berretta cooked is as close in taste to the fresh that I can find."
1,So Salty!,I was misled by the name and thought that the cotechino was imported from Italy. Wrong! It was made in the US but was so salty that it was inedible. You learn from your mistakes.
2,Disappointing,"I'm really not certain who would be particularly satisfied with this film. Some of the ""fright"" moments might have played well in the theater but they're not particularly scary. While the film is set up as a horror-mystery (with an intriguing premise) it doesn't deliver. There are huge logic gaps in the story once it unfolds which makes the sometimes slow pace of the film have no payoff in the end.There are some good performances here but the material is weak. There are some good ideas but they aren't well executed."
3,Beware what lurks in the shadows!!,"This movie is about a group of people who wake up in some sort of mental facility where they have no recollection of who they are, or how they got there. After a power outage, the chick realizes her padded rooms door is now unlocked and roams the place free finding other people in this place who also can not remember who they are or why they are there.Eventually the group left that find each other decide to try to escape but it's not as easy as they think as they start to discover that there is something in the shadows stalking them.Overall I thought this was a pretty cool movie, worthy of the rental and copy I burned of it.If you liked such movies like the remake of ""House On Haunted Hill"", ""Boo"" or ""Madhouse"" then this one should be enjoyable to you.I won't give away what the shadow is, but I will tell you it is not a ghost, nor a demon, so that may spark some interest for you to find out what it is."
4,not a fan of horror but,Really enjoyed this movie. Am a fan of the primary actors and was pleasantly surprised at just how good the movie was for a direct to DVD movie.
1,Just a mess,"I only ordered this because James Marsters was in it. The entire movie is a mess. Poor writing, lame special effects, etc.Even if you're a fan of James, I would pass on it. Instead watch some old Buffy reruns--it's much more satisfying."
3,Shadows Do Kill!,"This movie starts out pretty well is has suspense,mystery and a pretty well written script. Are cast find themselves waking up in a asylum where they have no memory of who they are and why they are there. Only to be pick off by a creature who has no shape or form. It is nothing more than a shadow that stalks them. Having no memory they have to find a way out and why they are there before it is to late. They soon discover there are eight of them trap in this place but one of them is not who they say they are. This begins mystery to discover who they are and what it is that is hunting them. The movie is pretty good it has very good acting a good plot and some suspense. It also has some mild violence with some good turns it. Don't expect a movie that will knock you off your feet but one that is above average that does keep your attention from begging to end. I say check it out I bought the DVD and have no real complaints its a good solid movie so check this one out."
2,Shadow Puppets,"I looked forward to this movie coming out for so long, but was disappointed. The story fell flat for me."
5,loving the Simmons,"I totally love this show, didn't catch all the episodes on mtv, so nice to see them all at once.Can't wait until all the other seasons are available."
5,I Luv Run's House,This a great spiritual family. Although at times the kids are a little bratty! Great Show!!!!!!!!
3,not if you want a fast charge,If you are looking for a battery charger that quickly charges your battery this one is not for you. but if it is only to maintain it then it is a good product.
1,Steve A. Sordello,I opened the box after Christmas. The second I plugged in this unit it went up in a Flash and a lot of Smoke. I am having a hard time getting through to Amazon for help in the exchange.Battery Tender 022-0165-DL-WH 12-Volt 2-Bank Battery Management System
5,Quality,A must have if you have multiple batteries to maintain during the winter. This unit is easy to use and even easier to set up
5,Excellent,Use this to charge the 2 batteries on my fishing boat. Does the job and it's nice to always have a full charge on the trolling motor.
5,Battery power to count on,"Had problems with my new ATV's starting and keeping a charge.None of them have a battery charging system. Got the Battery /tender on recomedation of the local Kaw and Suzuki dealer. Battery power to spare and no worries about weak batteries any more. Lawn mower, ATV, all thelittle batteries you have around the house. Great tool everyone needs. Easy to use apply and disconnect before jumping on and out to play."
5,battery charger,"This is the exact product I was hopeing for when I purchased it. Was purchsed to recharge my RV batteries in between camping trips, because we do alot of dry camping (meaning no hook-ups) and they do get drained. They are deep cycle batteries so the chargeing that happens while driving just is not enough to keep them at 100%. Some complaints about the short cables but not an issue for me as I just take the batteries from the trailer when we store it in between trips and hook them up back at the house, back up to 100% in 24hrs. Just hook up and leave it till the next trip,could not be easier to use."
5,A Perfect Fit,The Battery Tender management system is absolutely great. It is compact and well made. Setting it up was very easy and the unit does exactly what it's supposed to do. Give it serious consideration
5,Works for me,"I have to maintain about five marine batteries plus two cars and two atv's.This tender works very well,not a speed charger but about 24hrs to recharge.Over all very happy with it,and we have purchased two 2-bank chargers."
3,It does the job,This charger charges my two Harleys. That's about all I can say. I wish it was little better made. They made the shell out of cheap plastic. If it was made with a metal or heavy plastic case it would have made me feel better about spending the cash.
5,Dual Battery tender,Great product. It seems to work as designed. It was in stock and arrived quickly. What more can I say?
5,Battery Tender,Does a great job for the type of winter weather we have in North Alabama. It doesn't get below 30 often but when it does it's nice to have.
5,Excellent Battery tender,It works great and does a quick charge to the batteries. Wish the cables were longer so that you don't have motorcycles all grouped so close.
4,GREAT!!! device,"This was the best gift I received this Christmas. For years i've had troubles with batteries for my 2 bikes. It was soooo frustrating going out and hoping that they would start...............Not any more. I have both batteries connected in the garage and whenever I get the urge to ride.......VROOOOMMMM!!!!! bike will start up with no problem. I wish I had gotten this 3 years ago. If you have motorcycles, riding mowers etc. this is a must purchase."
5,Great product,"I now have a single and a double 1.25 amp Battery Tenders. They service my two Corvettes as well as a Buick that I don't use very much. Performance is as advertised, ie, they keep all the batterys 100% charged and ready to go. I am pleased."
1,Should have bought 2 separate Tenders,"I decided since I have more than one motorcycle to maintain the battery on in the winter I would purchase the 2 bank Battery Tender. It worked pretty good for about a year and a half before the left bank quit working. I contacted Deltran who told me to ship the unit back to them on my nickel and they would look at it and repair what went wrong then ship it back to me for $15. I kick myself in the back side for even wasting my money on this unit, I should have bought 2 separate units and would have been money ahead. Let the buyer beware!"
5,The Best,"Nobody Has A Better Product. The use of this product has saved me an unbelievable amount of money. One battery is the original from a 2003, Never have I had a bike battery last this long."
4,"Works well, but not to spec","It worked well for recharging the gel cell in one of my motorcycles. but the sealed lead acid Harley battery in my other motorcycle was down to 4+ volts and it wouldn't charge it until I brought it up to 5 volts with another charger. The manual says the charger won't charge batteries that are below 3 volts, so I was a little disappointed, but it did in fact restore the battery to 12volts after pre-charging it with a trickle charger."
2,Lasted about 16 months pop fuzz it done,This is the only manufacture that I could fine for just two outputs. Dam thing is after loosing this I still bought two more. Now if it goes out again in 16 months I'm going to raise hell with manufacture.
4,Battery Tender,Works great so far. Keeps the batteries on my boat charged and ready to go fishing. It was easy to set up and the quick disconects are very handy.
5,Astro Boy [Blu-ray],"Ordered for our grandsons at Christmas, but to them, they were too busy to watch it this time. Maybe next time. My wife and I loved it when we previewed it on cable televsion."
3,Nicolas Cage sorta ruins it,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* I have been wanting to see this movie, but not in theaters. So I bought it a few days ago, and watched it today, to my disappointment. The lines were pretty bad, and the president had to repeat around 10 times he wanted to be reelected. The movie seems to be going well until Nicolas Cage appears. I do not know if he was really trying, but he practically ruins the moment. I watched the film with my roomies. They had no idea what the movie was about, but did not feel anything when poor tobi kicked the bucket. Or when his father abandoned him, both very crucial parts that include Nicolas Cage's voice over. Tobi's death is ambiguous also. The action scenes were pretty good. Some minor adjustments in the script could of made this a classic. Some bad voices and script make this an average movie. Its fun to watch but dont expect anything out of it."
3,Be aware if taking little kids...this is not a G movie,"Although kids are likely only to remember the 90% good parts of the movie, do be aware there are two scenes that are likely to be frightening and question-provoking. #1 The scientist's child dies in the first few moments - killed by the peackeeper robot. #2 After creating the AstroBoy (to replace the dead child), the same scientist rejects Astroboy and says he doesn't want him around anymore and sends him away."
2,ASTRO BOY BOMBS AWAY?!....YEP!..... IT SURE DOES!,"Before I'm blasted for this review, let me start off by saying that I loved the original TV series when I was a kid and I still like to revisit it. This film just doesn't capture the feel of that show and even though the animation isn't bad, it also isn't all that great. I don't mind remakes when handled with care, but this one seems uninspired and almost pointless. Sure I want to see Astro Boy with all the advances made to animation, but lets do it with an inspired story and people who give a hoot. It's actually a boring movie, which should never be the case when you're talking about an animated film....or any film for that matter! Astro Boy bombs away? Yep!.. It sure does!"
1,A complete destruction of the original story,"I cannot fathom why would someone want to make a movie called Astro Boy if you are going to completely and uterly disregard the story created by Osamu Tezuka. This is just a futuristic pinochio with some excuse for actions scenes and a villain that does not know what he is supposed to do.This is just a sad attempt to earn some money from people on brand recognition, given that this is one of the most iconic characters in the history of comic books. What's original about this movie? The ""i-am-a-real-boy"" plot has been beaten to exaustion, and has been performed more interestingly, for example in AI. Another example of a robot story that's fun and created a new story, is Robots from 2005. It is by far nothing exceptional, but at least they don't steal the character names from somewhere else.If you want to see some real Astro boy stories, please go to the comics, also sold here or the TV series."
1,A subliminal brainwashing,"Aside from the movie itself, I would like to draw your attention to the subliminal brainwashing in this movie. For years, unless you have no perception, the limousine Communists in Hollywood have made movies advocating Communist totalitarianism (e.g., The Motorcycle Diaries, Che, Reds, The Front, etc.). In their attempt at brainwashing, they have also gone for the kids. In this particular movie, you have a couple of lovable robots who are adorable Marxists. Now, you can imagine what the liberals' reaction would have been if the couple of lovable robots would have been adorable Nazis. (And then liberals wonder why nobody can stand them)"
5,Awesome!,I had seen this movie on satellite tv and my son really liked it. When we switched tv programming we could not find the movie so I searched and could not find it in any retail store. When I found the movie at Amazon I ordered it immediately and we have enjoyed watching the movie ever since. The animation is great and the story line is one to be cherished.
3,MY GRADE: B minus,"Based on a long-running Japanese series of the same name. Astro Boy is created by his grieving father to replace his deceased son but turns into an unexpected superboy who is pitted against machines and people throughout this tale as he tries to do the right thing and shows human emotions and choices even though many consider him just a machine. Voices include Kristen Bell, Nicolas Cage and Donald Sutherland. It's mostly suited for children but all ages should enjoy this to a certain level. The budget for this was $65M but only yielded a bit over $48M at the Box Office, according to Wiki. STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; SPECIAL EFFECTS/ACTION SCENES: B; OVERALL GRADE: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: 2 days ago."
4,Buena versión de Astro Boy,Es una buena versión de Astro Boy computarizada. No viene doblada ni tiene subtítulos en español. Se puede ver en familia.
5,Good show,I was a little disappointed that there wasn't a segment of the origenal (Which I watched every day back in the 60's) but all in all it was a good movie and the picture was great as well as the sound.
5,Great Movie!,This is a movie for every one. Clear CG on Blu-Ray and good story line for any one to understand.
3,Sad,"Watched movie with my husband and nine year old daughter, both thought it was good, and so did I. I just didn't like the way the story went, very sad and left me feeling angry."
2,IT IS BORING1,"I love cartoons, I love Animation. After seeing this movie all the way through, I was dissapointed and I wanted my time back. The problem with this movie was, if you had seen all the trailers, you had seen almost all the interesting parts. The plot was OK, the execution sucked. With a little bit more of intelligent thought and creativity and good execution to the plat. The movie could have been a winner. It was choppy, scenes did not smoothly flow from one to another. It was scene A, stop our time is up, start scene B, never mind there was no continuation or bridge between scenes. I am planning to sell, trade ,or give away my BD, because I will NEVER see it again."
3,Use your own balls,"I've had these for about 4 months now, and the one thing I noticed is that the thread on the balls does not last. They will just fall off, even if they are screwed on all the way. Other than that, the Bioplast is very comfortable and has helped healing, so great. I've replaced the balls with ones that I had from metal horseshoes, and now they are ok."
4,Great Resource for Couples,Chapman does a great job of having couples set their focus on Jesus through His Word which draws them closer. You'll get as much out of this as you're willing to put into it.
2,"where, oh where???","...does a body find a good, well-written, and meaningful book for couples potentially in crisis, or seeking to avoid it, that isnt all churchy? *sigh*"
2,the seller did well,"The seller did well and delivered what was promised...great condition. I had just researched the product, and expected something different."
1,horrable,"This book sucks. the whole book was or had every thing refering it to god and jesus. can't i get a book that will help out with our hearing about what god will think? not a good book, i didn't even finish the book it made me so mad. total wasst of money."
4,Scott Foresman Handbook for Writers,I purchased this book because I teach a journalism class and thought it would help. The book is in excellent condition. It is nice to know that one can purchase an excellent quality book on line. Thank you!
2,Not what I ordered,This was a sample copy of the text for a teacher to review...could not sell it back. I was not happy.
1,Horrible. Really horrible.,"I tried two menus. Of the three recipes comprising these menus, one was inedible (I threw it away after one bite), one was barely okay (I ate it but threw away the leftovers), and one was just okay (I ate it, but I won't make it again). Also, the recipes are badly written--sometimes ingredients in the ingredient list are left out of the instructions. This is the worst cookbook I've ever used."
1,Too Much History,"This book did nothing to help me set up DNS on an NT network. The book went into great detail on how Bind files and resource records work, but had less than one paragraph detailing how these files work on a NT DNS system that does not use the Registry. I found the NT Resource kit to be much more valuable resource for NT DNS."
3,Needs sample configurations,"I had ordered this book expecting it to help in configuring Windows NT DNS in an internet environment. It only summarized and provided a few screen shots without matching explanations. I wish it had usefull (real-life like) examples.Overall, it is a satisfactory book covering NT's DNS utility."
1,Too vague to get any good from it,"I feel this book was too vague, no coverage of any basic knowledge for setting up a Windows Nt DNS server I would recommend skipping over this book if you need real information for setting up a DNS server"
1,total junk,total waste of time. I devoted 3 minutes to it and lots of fast forward. from the first moment i could tell it's junk by the music.
1,TOTAL CRAP!!,"I am writing this review solely as a act of benevolence for those of you who have not yet seen this completely moronic pile. I wasted two hours of my life watching this DVD last night and I wish that I could get it back. So, for your sake, I advise you to stay away from this one. It has a promising premise, I know. But it is so poorly written that you feel taken advantage of because it undermines your intelligence. They thought that by putting in every dark subject matter they could think of, it might pass as artsy reality fare, but it fails miserably. You can see through their effort, just as you can see through the many plot holes abound. Not even entertaining - do something else with your time, while you still can. Peace."
1,The most pathetic film ever!,"Okay everyone, get ready for a really crapily written reveiw that does a bad job of convinsing you how terrible this movie is. That said, let me begin... I just watched this movie and it is the dumestest dumest dum movie I have seen in a very long time. The movie is especially terrible because it trys to pawn itself off as a good film. Do not be fooled by this cra*- actually, I take that back. If you are fooled by it, you just aren't a good enough person to deserve to recognize its obvious patheticness. The movie is full of flaws- and the terrible thing is that I can appreciate a film with flaws, even many! But these flaws are at the heart of this picture. This movie review doesn't diserve a spell check. Peace, C"
1,somewhere in the world David Lynch is vomiting,"I have to dig my way through this muddle of a movie. What is there to say about it? It's terrible, it tries to force chronological inconsitencies on us so that we can marvel at the sheer brilliance of the writers and the director, the writing is lazy, it tries to hard so hard to be cerebral that whatever plot there was is lost in an ocean of weak plot twists and bad acting. The concept is quite good, but the execution is disgustingly bad. I'm a fan of That 70's Show and I have nothing against Ashton Kutcher. It's just a BAD movie."
1,1 Star Too Many,"Perhaps the stinkiest piece of crap in the history of crap. Makes Dude, Where's My Car? look like Citizen Kane. I'd like my two hours back, please."
1,Don't believe the hype.,A plot that is complete nonsense. A sad script. A stupid lead actor. Don't waste your time with this one.
3,Kutcher is good,"Plot holes sprout up all over the place in ""The Butterfly Effect"", but the film holds up quite well when watching it purely for entertainment value. Ashton Kutcher is the showcase here, delivering a strong performance as a college psych student who suffers from a troubling past. The film is surprisingly graphic and disturbing, but offers some nice twists and turns that keep it interesting and offbeat."
4,Very Intense!,"Wow! I really liked this movie much more than I thought I would. I was really impressed with Ashton Kutcher's performance.It's a story about Evan (Kutcher) who has blackouts as a young child. He keeps journals and writes down everything he can remember so he can try and jog his memory. Later in life he is able to read these journals and use his memories to go back in time and change what happened then, and by doing that, he also changes the future. A very interesting movie!"
5,"Despite bad Reviews, I loved it","I thought this was an excellent movie, at least way better than what the critics said. I would go as far to say that it is oscar-worthy, but an all-around good film."
5,Lost for words........,"There aren't too many movies that when I leave the cinema, I am lost for words and that anxious feeling in my stomach. This is a very unique movie. I reckon I recommended this to just about everyone I know. It just seems to leave that funny feeling with you. The way it ended was great aswell. Good to watch something different every now and again.Hats off to Kutcher for a great performance aswell, as I didn't expect him to pull this one off. A must buy.Cheers."
5,The Butterfly Effect,"This is definitely one of the most thought provoking movies I've ever seen.It has a very complicated plot where you need to pay attention to the entire movie but once you get it, it's all worth it.I think the previews for this movie really made it seem as if it was scary in a way but it's just a really really intense drama.To me,anyway.Some people might find this movie hard to watch because of some of the intense scenes having to do with death/suicide,violent children,and child pornography;but I believe all that just made the movie more real.The ending of this movie is also great.It's not exactly happy, but it's not completely depressing.I couldn't think of a better way the movie should have ended.I will definitely buy this movie as soon as it is released on DVD.I think it is probably my favorite movie."
4,A mental treat,"Because of the mixed reviews I had read, I didn't know what to expect before watching the movie. I was impressed from beginning to end. Though disturbing in several areas, the film kept my attention and engaged my mind. Ashton Kutcher gave an excellent performance, as did the other actors. The plot was unique, so this wasn't a run-of-the-mill psychological thriller. Character development was superb, making the storyline that much more engaging and important. I'm glad I ignored the bad reviews and checked it out for myself. It was worth the watch."
4,I agree with everyone here,"Except the people who give this movie 3 stars or less. This movie was definitely deserving of 4 stars in simply its originality. You can't deny that you've ever thought of what it would be like to change something in time. To go back and change something to better your life or someone else's. This movie completely hits that at all angles showing the downside of what it would be like to change time while showing the plus side as well. I won't like, I simply do not like Ashton Kutcher but this movie at least made me respect him as an actor, because I now know he can do that. Amy Smart is great in it as well but I was really blown away by Kutcher's performance. Great movie, maybe not a ""must-have"" but definitely at least rent it."
4,Re-Release Fixed Subtitle Problem?,"The previous release, ""Despite saying that it has English and Spanish subtitles, in fact doesn't have either.Although the subtitle tracks appear when you press the 'subtitle' option on your remote, you get no subtitles. The only subtitle track that works is the infifilms 'fact track' subtitles that displays info periodically throughout the course of the movie.""(...)So, this New release for june 7th, 2005 will have this problem fix?I hope! if some1 buys it , please be kind and inform of thisthank you"
4,I couldn't believed I liked this movie.,"But I did. Because it had Ashton K. in it, and because it got bad reviews I passed on it. However, watched it this weekend and it was a great movie. Don't let the Ashton name fool you or the bed reviews it is a really good movie."
3,why do they insist on changing the movie?,"First off I loved the movie, mind benders I've always liked but Its one thing to have a directors cut and whatnot and 99% of time its better then the theatrical release. The dvd version is the real ending. I hated the ended in the blu ray, what they needed to do with the blu ray if they were going to do thing a;t ending is have it randomly go to either ending and blu ray is capable of that. An infant strangling itself is not believable on any level and just ruined the entire movie. The original ending of breaking off any relation with Kailey at age 7 and showing some unknown connection to each other as they passed on the streets decades later was actually believable and the story made some kind of sense even with the dozen or so holes in the concept."
3,Why did they have to cast Ashton? Why?,"I loved this movie except for Ashton. He was too goofy and laid back during serious scenes. It reminded me of Donnie Darko a lot, but there was much better acting in that film. And, the story was better. Just watch Donnie Darko."
1,"Doubt ""Infinifilm Edition""","I agree to C.Spengler who posted above.Unfortunately, I ordered this DVD before that review was posted, so I face the same problem. I am foreign and my English hearing ability is not good enough.This DVD case is printed ""English subtitles"", ""Spanish subtitles"", and ""Closed Caption"" at bottom, but none of them is encoded.Is this DVD a defective product or something, especially ""Closed Caption"" is not implemented?"
2,Not all that good,"Character development was not very good. I found myself not especially liking or having a reason to like any of the characters in the movie. They seemed all so shallow and self-centered. The movie jumps back and forth so much it seems like the people who made the movie may have been on drugs of some kind. Creative idea for a movie, but what does the magic in the movie have to do with Chaos Theory? This should be more thoroughly explained, right??Kutcher is a great ""bad boy"" actor..that is about the only talent in the film."
2,"EXTREMELY VIOLENT ""THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT"" DVD",I am disappointed. The film has violent and bloody scenes every couple of minutes!I won't view this a second time!
2,"Good Movie, Terrible DVD","I've been holding out for Bluray, but wanted a friend to see it so I picked up this inexpensive DVD version as a stopgap.I fell in love with the Directors' Cut of this movie, on an older issue two-sided DVD.This is NOT that DVD. They have compressed both versions to the extent that they fit on a single side.I'm sure this saves Newline some bucks. But it essentially ruins the video. Just AWFUL. Many scenes show heavy macroblock tiling. Additionally, I ran into some playback problems with the MacOS DVD Player application as well as VLC.Bottom line: very good movie, skip this edition."
3,Its ok,"(...)However it is entertaining, and no it is not in the same class as Donnie Darko as one reviewer said. Its like a Twilight Zone episode, based on changing the past to effect the present. Kutcher is surprisingly good as the lead and it is entertaining all the way through. I could have done without the Dawsons Creek/Teen Movie mentality coming in a couple of times - you know the cheesy music/couple shots etc.But it is good, I'd recommend it."
1,bad buy,"no case, was sent to me in a small cd envelope with only one side of the disc working. the directors cut. but not the other side. not at all what i expected"
1,DOESNT WORK IN US,"If I could have rated a ZERO star I would have. This doesn't work in the us, wrong zone. Why can you sell it here!?!"
3,Annoying,"I like Ashton, and his attempt to spread out is admirable. This movie, initially intriguing, collapses with the preppie angle. It's interesting to see ""Earl's"" brother at an earlier time."
2,"""Kutcher is sooo Dreamy...."" Another Twilight Zone ripoff..","Why do people in Hollywood try to take a 30 minute episode of the Twilight Zone and stretch it out to almost 2 hours??This movie is way too long. Kutcher is brought in to draw the teen demographic but he is not the real problem; the story is too slow and does'nt cover any new ground.Rod Serling is'nt rolling in his grave, he is probably laughing at the ineptness of the whole film."
5,"AWESOME, PURELY AWESOME",I just bought the DVD and saw the movie for the first time...and i thought it was freakin AWESOME. Seeing as how Ashton Kutcher is totally opposite as his alter ego Michael Kelso...it made the movie even more interesting! Good Job Ashton!
1,Very Disappointed,Disc appeared to be foreign made. Had no menu and had an alternate ending that was different from the original theatrical release. The original theatrical release was not on the disc. Very Disappointed!
3,Pretty good,I watched this movie not thinking much of Kutcher's acting ability. I was pleasantly surprised.
4,VERY GOOD MOVIE,"this movie is great. the polt, story its all good. maybe the actings a little...but besides that its very good. Its that kinda movie that leaves you thinking after you leave the theater. see, you also gotta pay attention to whats goin on. you can't take bathroom breaks! lol because if you leave the theater for even 5 or then minutes you'll lose track of whats goin on. There are sum parts that are a little confusingm so you have to pay attention. im about to go see it again"
5,Good Flick,This is a good movie. Lots of plot twists. The ending will leave you feeling weird and a little depressed.Definately worth watching.
2,piss poor of a movie,"didn't even finish watching this movie.Ashton might be appropriate in some films but with this one, the plot of the movie is not very good to start and Ashton makes it even worse."
4,The effect of butterflies,"I think this was a really good time travel, alternate reality type movie. It has a cool story but some parts are really dark... maybe darker then they had to be, but overall its a good movie and worth checking out."
4,Butterfly Effect,Excellent movie. Really psychological. It was deep and I had to have it in my collection. My personal opinion is that it was a Sixth Sense type of movie. I highly recommend it!
4,A Suprise,"I actually just viewed this movie a couple of nights ago and was suprised that I actually enjoyed it. Dark and demented, this movie actaully plays on a scientific and psychological mind that is very unique. I have to say, I was not familiar with the ""Butterfly Effect"" Theory and background, but I decided to research the material and had fun doing it! So I learned something new and I watched a curious and great movie as well."
2,Not impressed,"I have no idea why this movie gets such a good rating on amazon. The acting is terrible, the plot turns are predictable (and at time ludicrous) and the final message of the story that everything would have been better if the main character was never born is absolutely uninspiring. I was optimistic coming in but after watching this I now think the airhead who recommended this to me when I said I like time travel stories is an idiot and probably only liked this movie because it was stupid simple (while pretending to be clever) and because she probably thought Ashton Kutcher was cute or something. This movie was total rubbish and a waste of my time."
2,At least Kutcher tried something new,"This movie had a lot of potential, but somewhere along the way, fell way short of expectations. Everyone was interested in seeing Kutcher in a more serious role and he did very well, along with the rest of the cast. The problem stemmed more from plot holes and a lack of connection to reality. The idea is cool, the guy can basically warp his brain and memories from when he was younger to alter the present, but in the end it seemed very rushed and went in to many different directions before ending at a heaping mess of an ending.I wanted to like this movie, and parts were kind of neat, but in the end, more time should have been spent reconstructing the script so that it could have been a much more intelligent movie and a real winner at the box office."
3,PISSED ME OFF,ALL THIS MOVIE DOES IS MAKE YOU THINK AND THAT IS ABOUT IT. LIKE REALLY I SPENT MORE TIME LOOKING INTO SPACE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON INSTEAD OF WATCHING THE MOVIE LIKE SO MANY SCENES MADE ME HELLA AGRY AND THE WORST PART ABOUT IT IS THE ENDING I MEAN THE DUDE GETS NOTHIN NOT THE GIRL NOT THE FRIENDS HE GETS NOTHING. AND THE VERY WORST PART OF THIS ALL IS THAT THE WORLD IS BETTER OFF WITHOUT HIM. HOW MESSED UP IS THAT. IM HECKA PISSED. BUT STILL IF YOU WANT TO WAKE YOUR MIND UP AND TAKE IT FOR A THRILL RIDE WATCH THIS MOVIE PLEASE. --- SEAN
2,Story of Violence,"The movie is bad. Really. Doesn't follow the rules that establishes at the beggining, the acting is wooden, and overall seems rushed. If you look at the ""behind the scenes"" featurette, you can understand that the two young directors have energy, but don't seem very, how to say it, intellectual in their approach to cinema.This movie is about sadism and violence in general. How people act against each other, and the results of their actions. In this sense, ""The Butterfly Effect"" work as an indictment of the cowboy syndrome. But being this a latent interpretation, is not enough. Anyway, the show of violence makes all of us voyeurs of many disturbing things. As in any Hollywood war movie, to show violence and to insinuate or say that is bad is to be hypocrital. For those who gave this movie many stars, please watch more (and better) cinema and then re-watch and have a say (again)."
5,Its like the Time Machine but a crazy version,This is a good movie that is alot like the time machine but different but good. I recently bought the dvd and i thoght it was not going to be good but i bought it anyway and liked it. SO i think all people should see it there are some really violent parts but its all part of the story.
2,"This had an effect, but not a good one.","I heard nothing but good words before I saw this. I didn't hear or read any criticism, so I went into the movie with an open mind and lots of hope that this would be a movie that I would enjoy. I was very wrong. I was disturbed by parts (and I've seen some very disturbing movies, but this was just too much for me) and I was also bored halfway through the film. I saw about half and didn't watch the other half. I also couldn't stand all the switching screens all the time, I was losing my train of thought as to what was actually happening. I love 'psychological thrillers' as I would call this movie, but this..this was just not what I expected. At all. It almost makes me wonder if everyone was watching the same movie as I was. But I guess they were. Maybe you'll have to see it for yourself, but for me, I'll pass."
2,"Save your money, and Stay far away from this movie","If you are a sane Christian or Jew, and sick an tired ofweird sicko movies --stay far away from this movie. There is noexcitement; just sorrow for the Director and Play nwriters.The lead actor's childhood sweetheart has blue eyes. As a teenager she has brown eyes, and in her late teens, blue again. She dies and then doesn't die. This is the least of the problems with this film. Their is a big fat guy named thumper who masterbates in his bed clothes, a poor dog set on fire, and many more disgusting things. This is a movie that no sane individual should pay to see."
1,I wish I could go back in time to stop myself from watching,"From the editorial review...""subplots involving child pornography, animal cruelty, and profanely violent children, it's a stretch to call it entertainment"". This pretty much says it all. That and like the characters in this film, we're all better off without Ashton Kutcher. Stay away from this bad seed unless you want to be depressed for a while. Or unless ""subplots involving child pornography, animal cruelty, and profanely violent children"" or burly men assaulting Ashton Kutcher in prison are your thing."
3,Hmmm,"Well if you ignore the fact that this movies makes no sense, then it's pretty good. I've scientifically analyzed every second of this movie, and the plot is more inconsistent than the Yankees (I won't go into detail about the inconsistencies, but they're definitely there). This movie is also full of annoying characters, especially Tommy. I estimated that kid to be approximately 4'2"" and 67 lbs. Yet he thinks he's a badass, and he beats the crap outta kids twice his size, including a 17 year old at the movie theater. That kid could have done several things to avoid the beatdown he got from little 9 year old Tommy (stepped on him, flicked him in the forehead, picked him up and tossed him into the corner, etc). And not to be nitpicky, but if you notice the outside of the theater, two of the movies playing are Se7en and Dumb and Dumber. Those movies were released a year apart and were in theaters nowhere near the same time, just in case anyone forgot."
3,Worth a watch,"I'll be frank, I skipped this show because of Ashton Kutcher. The thought being if he starred in it, it must be fluff. But the reviews for the show were positive enough to draw me in and rent the dvd.SPOLIERSPremise: Imagine a person who was not meant to be born was born. As a result he has the ability to travel to back to any point in his life and make changes to it. The downside is that each time he does that, his actions can cause life altering situations. Hence the Butteryfly effect (The wind from a butterfly's wing could cause a tornado somewhere else).I had problems with Ashton's character, being very rash and just a little stupid, but then again he was experiencing brain damage as a result of his actions. I won't give the ending away but... this is not a exactly a feel good show.I have to admit I liked the show. Its a good rental but probably not a keeper. Acting was passable and plot was good. Despite an ending that many will balk at it was realistic and brave."
1,misleading info-NO subtitles,"I loved this movie, but missed a lot of the dialogue as I have hearing disabilities. the information above and on the back cover clearly state they include english subtitles, but there were none. I later found out Infinifilm omitted subtitles on many of their releases of movies. I can only watch this by having someone tell me what folks just said. VERY disappointed. they need to update the data above to remove the inclusion of subtitles..."
3,Strangely Interesting,"I think Ashton Kutcher did a good job on this film. I recall that Kutcher has never made a film like this, and his first thriller was somewhat peculiar. Not just any old thriller, this one would keep you on the edge of your seat from the start to the finish. A weird title however, but the tag line explains all. Change one thing, change everything. I think this automatically gets you thinking, and as the film proceeds, it gets harder.As you may all already be aware, there are two versions of the film (well the Ending) and they both have completely different appeal, for me the directors ending is superior, it is more unexpected and far more shocking, but it does end the film on a slight downer, which is why the original release was happier (even though it didn't really fit the film)."
4,the butterfly effect,"I had the opportunity to see ""The Butterfly Effect"", and this could well be the movie that will take Kutcher to a new level in acting. The plot was complicated, spanning a lifetime. It is based on the theory that the flutter of a butterfly's wings can result in a tsunami on the other side of the world and someones's birth can have the same ripple effect. Thru' time travel Kutcher replays his life over and over again until he rights the negative effects of his birth. I would be interested to know what ending they used for the movie, as I viewed the director's cut. I was told that the movie slated for release has a different ending. I HOPE NOT!! The ending I saw tied the whole plot together and made for a very good story. Didn't get up to pee once!!"
1,You people are crazy! This movie was lame!,"When i rented this film i foreshadowed disapointment. I thought ashton kutcher would ruin the film but he actually made a good performance. This movie was creative and interesting until the end. it was so idiotic. nothing was explained at all. how did he get these powers, why, what was the point. The story was so flawed. This seems like a lame attempt to copy donnie darko!"
4,Identity win,"Although this DVD is really a big hit,my comment is very simple...Identity win.I find that this kind of pyscho movies are really intresting in term of schoking moments that you get right before the titles and that was my main reason when i saw this movie.Actually it did not disappointed me at all but still there is a question mark about it....Butterfly effect is one of the film that you will really enjoy seeing it, but does not leave that deep impressons deep down your soul.U will tend to forget it after a while and maybe do not talk about it or recommended to a freind...and that's remain my question..why does this happen ??? athough it is a great movie..."
5,awesome,"This movie kept me on the edge of my seat,But I have a question, was his father ableTo do the same thing as his son, but withPictures, thats the only part that to meReally was not explained.But, that didnt ruin it for me, the actorsblew me away, to see ashton go from kelso toEvan, I'm a huge fan.must see!!!"
3,"Family in the flick, no credit given.","I must say this movie was strange and the only reason I went to see it was that my younger Brother was cast as an extra. (prison scene, yes they are real imates from Monroe washinton in this film) I wanted to see if his scenes were in the film. They were, in fact he got to throw a wad of paper at Ashton Kutcher charater and yell 'hey you maggot...' or other words. He was only in the lunchroom sence, the one drinking the milk (table behind Ashton left shoulder), and in the main yard there is a group of imates (real ones) staring at the 'new guy'.Overall if you have kids, the scene with the children is quite distrubing. Not that they show anything, the suggest that young kids (<12) had a sexual encounter.If you can stand flash backs, and F!bombs go see this movie..- NTS"
3,Didn't effect me,"Ashton Kutcher did ok, his best film yet, he's not being a goof for once which was different for him ,but he put it off and did a decent job, hope he keeps it up.Amy Smart is also in the film and does well .The plot was a little off the hook mind twisting to see what was real or was anything real at all.Evan Treborn (Kutcher)trys to make life the best he can for himself ,as a kid he had black outs and was told to write down everything he could in a journal, after years gone by he read the journal and starts to put pices together, from the black outs he had as a kid, and really goes back in time in his own mind to sees if his life could of have been different by differnt incidence's being changed, some which can be disturbing to some.Sound a little confusing it can be but not a bad movie so get ready for the effect it has on you and Enjoy!!!"
3,Good film. Very creepy.,"This reminded me of DONNIE DARKO. It wasn't as good as Donnie, but it was very interesing, and kept you involved in the story. Ashton Kutcher wasn't bad in his first dramatic role. Needless to say, I was very surprised. Even though it was very predictable at times, there was always a twist or two that you didn't see coming. Very weird.Recommended!"
4,"Reasonable movie, great concept, good suspense","This was a better than average, pleasent surprise when I saw it in theaters, and was descent when I saw it again. Aston Kutcher plays a kid who has had several bumps in the road over the years, but discovers a special ""gift"" while studying late at night. He findsa that he is able to travel back to times of high emotions in his life where he can have a chance to alter the course that his life takes. Soon he discovers there is more behind this gift that what he could ever imagine.This is a reasonable film that was just fun to watch, and the dvd has a lot of extras, including an alternate ending that I am very glad the hollywood producers did not make the original ending. Check this out, chances are you will be surprised too."
5,Butterfly Effect,"This is one movie I had to see over and over again as I brought family and friends to experience it. Ashton and the rest of the cast were phenominal! The story line kept the viewer intrigued. It evoked so many different emotions to watch the ""effects"" of trying to change one's past. Awesome movie. Needs to win a Golden Globe at least!!!"
5,I Definitely Disagree With the Critics. Great Film,"I have never seen Ashton Kutcher in any of his films or on his television show, so I had no opinion of his acting skills, which are great. The pacing of the show kept me spellbound and this was the only movie I talked about for an entire weekend. From opening night I have waited for the DVD, just so I can revisit it and catch all the clues I missed. Don't miss it."
4,Wow! Really Quite Good!,"I saw this movie yesterday, thinking I could just slot it in with the rest of the slightly dumb teen movies out there. (Can i help it if I enjoy some of those movies?)But the butterfly effect suprised me by being smart, quirky, and overall pretty 'effective'.It was a lot of fun watching Kutcher's character mess around with time, and seeing how one action can change the lives of so many people.There were some nonsensical loopholes in the film, which i'll refrain from going into- I don't want to spoil anything, but overall it was pretty tight and a lot of fun to watch.*BONUS* if you're an Ashton Kutcher fan, he's a pretty big cutie in this movie!!!I recommend it!"
3,Poor mans version of Donnie Darko,"(see above for a full film synopsis)In short, this film is about a man who finds out he can travel back into his past to change events, which inevitably leads to tragedy. His main reason was to save his girlfriend from tragedy, but then by doing so, other tragic events happen as a result (the chaos theory comes into effect), and he has to keep going back to alter them.This is an incredibly depressing film! Literally nothing happy happens and its one tragedy after another, dealing with murder, prostitution, vandalism, even paedophilia.Its not a bad film, its quite well executed, well acted, but for me the actual way he can go back in time (by reading his journals??? - its a simple as that) is just lazy writing. Its never explained how this 'phenomenon' works.This is a poor mans Donnie Darko in my mind, but I'd rent the dvd and not buy it."
4,It is the first interesting thing Ashton Kuttcher has,"done if you don't count dating Demi Moore. He does an excellent job here. The title comes from the arcane chaos theory which is explained on the dvd. It is a horror/sci-fi movie that kept me engrosed & is the best of that genre this year. His childhood was miserable & disfunctional. As a college student he discovers a way to go back to his childhood to set things right. One little change however, alters the lives of his three friends & himself in horrifing, unimaginable ways. When you think things can't get worse, they do. The finale is brillant. I saw the directors cut which is a totally different though sadder ending that the theatrical version. But if you like horror or science fiction , you should enjoy this."
3,"Great story, good direction and not suitable for children","Let me start by saying that I viewed this movie in the theatre and was, as I am with many movies today, appalled to find that people are bringing children to R-rated flicks. This is a wonderfully directed blend of eerie mystery, dark comedy and offers a refreshing view on relationships and sacrifice. The direction was beatiful and the content mature. As a major critic of Ashton Kutcher's acting ability I must say that this role bodes well with his often aloof expressions, and I did recommend it to my friends. Definitely worth owning.Hope this helps."
4,Awesome suspensful movie!!,"Even though the concept is kinda corny, you gotta love the suspense and storyline. I always liked this movie, especially the shower scene ;) and we needed to see Amy Smart naked, that would definitely up the rating another star. But this is a movie you gotta pay attention too, put the pieces together, I wouldn't reccomend it for slow people, cause then you are just wasting your money.Gotta check this movie out if you like suspense, with a little bit of good comedy. 2 thumbs up!!!!!!!!!!"
3,AWESOME MOVIE!,"If I am refering to this as ans AWESOME MOVIE, you may ask yourself why did I only give the DVD 3 stars. Well, I'll tell you why. Because the alternate ending was absolutely the DUMBEST scenerio that they could have dreamt up. It's the type of thing that a writer should have been fired for even suggesting when they were coming up with potential endings. Otherwise, this is a great flick, despite the fact that it may have been better with a more dramatic young actor than Kutcher, perhaps Chris Klein or the guy from The Ring. No matter how powerful the story may be, all I see is Kelso going back in time."
3,Not so great,"I was so excited to see this movie, and it was good and mysterious until you figured out what was happening. It then got a little tedious. Kutcher can't act, which doesnt help the movie. Many better movies to tweak the brain."
2,"after a promising start, this lost me completely","While I tried hard to like this, I found the acting so mediocre and the plot twists so outlandish, that I simply could not forget that this was a made-up thing and believe it for a time. The actors all seem like amateurs - there is little chemistry between would-be lovers and friends, just lousy acting.ALso, it is not very good sci-fi: I mean, like his dad this guy just has some kind of power to go back in time and change things by looking in his diary or at old photos (but not otherwise!). Then, once he's back in the present, he can remember how things were, unlike anyone else who's affected. While the ways that things change with his meddling is intriguing, it was too lacking in subtlty to seduce my imagination. So I just couldn't believe any of it.Not recommended."
3,Donnie Darko for Dummies,"I like what this movie tries to do. Basically, they took the complexity of Donnie Darko and dumbed it down for a wider audience. It's a good movie, but only if you can handle cheesy plot twists. I didn't take this movie seriously when I watched it and was therefore able to enjoy it. It's time machine meets Donnie Darko."
4,not a hardback,"This is not a hardback but one of a trilogy of books by Chris Moser at the Riverside Metropolitan Museum, CA - all of the books are still available at the museum shop. Good catalog of the Museum's collection with small black and white photos of each basket, plus some great color photos of a select few."
4,Tommy Dorsey - Big Band Swing,"This is the band Tommy first recorded with after the Dorsey Bros. Orchestra, which he had co-run with his brother Jimmy since 1928, broke up acrimoniously earlier in 1935.Tommy's band was now a standard big band of the swing era, consisting of five brass, four reeds and a four-man rhythm section, and at its best it is, as heard here, a first-class outfit. Tommy occasionally plays what later became his trademark melody-singing trombone, but there are some hot solo breaks too. Some half-dozen of the tracks here were recorded by a smaller unit from the band, the Clambake Seven, and while they are good in their way they sound rather like old-fashioned collective improvisation. I have found it useful to programme only the big-band tracks for my usual listening, and these are immensely satisfying. Strongly recommended."
4,Extra's included & the disc up-scales nicely,"Standered digital DVD with a great picture, the disc it up-scales nicely in Blu-ray player, also DVD includes audio commentary with Wes Craven, & Heather Langenkamp, John Saxon, & the director of photography. also you can watch the movie in two viewing format's widescreen or full screen formatOther interesting little feature notes: you can play it in your computers DVD-ROM & read the screen play while you watch the film & there is a trivia game too, I think this disc is a great value for the price if you enjoy the original Nightmare On Elm Street film as I do."
5,Excellent Book About an Exciting Opening,"The Semi-Slav is one of the most popular and interesting defenses around today. It's pretty much up to White whether it will lead to a quiet positional game or a firefight, but from that point just about anything can happen. Author Sadler may be on his way to being not only England's best player, but one of its best writers as well. The lines and games are almost all recent and topical. As far as I can tell, this book is the best Semi-Slav book around and a worthy, even superior, companion volume to the author's book on the Slav proper."
5,Accurate translation,"For those readers who do not have knowlege of either Hebrew or Greek, this is generally considered the most accurate of translations available. But be prepared for uncommon style. The NASB is more readable than the KJV, but similar to the NKJV, although it draws on more eclectic manuscript evidence. The Lockman Foundation is the proprietor of this translation and has retained the faithfulness of the 1977 version, while updating the archaic remnants of the NAS (1901). The Smyth-sewn binding is a rare commodity in bookbinding these days, providing a long-lasting, quality book. Black letter version is increasingly harder to find, and this is a plus as well."
1,This book STINKS,"With each page being a chapter, and some chapters being 1 sentence long (truly!) and with there being NO cohesive rhyme or reason as to how the book is laid out and with the book being only 60 pages long, this is truly one of the most horrible books I've ever read!!I wanted to learn about Rasta and instead got a few glimmers of confusion, a bit about Jamaican life, a bunch of negativity about people who are NOT Rastas.If you want to learn about Rasta, do NOT buy this book!"
1,More Information Needed,"I like to learn about beliefs of other cultures and people, and I was curious to learn about Rastafarianism. I was not satisfied with the information I obtained from this book. It touched on tidbits of Rastafarianism, and often swayed from the main topic. The point of view seems to be more opinionated rather than alot of hard solid facts. There would be mention of various topics apart from actual Rastafarianism and those other topics would be tied in with Rastafarianism by a quote or something. I really thought it would have been more in depth on Rastafarianism as a whole."
1,Really?,I have simply this to say about this book: Go elsewhere. The mere fact that the title includes 'rastafarianism' should be a large red flag. There are no 'ism's in Rastafari. Go back type 'rastafari' in the search bar and buy the first book by Barry Chevannes.Wesley
3,Amanda's Nutri-Help,"I really haven't used the product long enough to post a relevant review. So far, I am pleased with the product. I learned quickly that it must be mixed with milk. When mixed with water, it is not pleasant-tasting. My granddaughter still doesn't drink enough milk, but seems to like the Total Health mix."
1,CHANGED FORMULA!! YUCK!!,"THEY HAVE CHANGED THE INGREDIENTS!!! IT IS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTING!!!! CHEAPER FOR THEM, LESS TASTE AND NUTRITION FOR TODDLERS. MY DAUGHTER LITERALLY BEGGED FOR THIS DRINK IN THE PAST AND NOW WON'T EVEN FINISH IT. PLUS IT NO LONGER DISSOLVES COMPLETELY. I WAS SO HAPPY TO FIND A RICE BASED PRODUCT WITH HIGH QUALITY INGREDIENTS. NOW I AM ON THE SEARCH AGAIN. I AM RETURNING ALL THAT I BOUGHT AND WON'T BE GOING BACK!"
3,Super Reader,"This is set in an earlier time than the last book, and the main character is Cletus Grahame, an ancestor of Donal. The title is the title of a work of what he sees as revolutionary strategy he is currently working on, being crippled and not so useful running around a battlefield.He gradually uses his theories to become a very important man, and later on has increasing mental powers which allow him to heal his injured leg. His theories revolve around making the other guy screw up."
3,"dated, best for teens","I bought this based on the other Amazon reviews and was sorely disappointed. The book was written a long time ago and shows it in its treatment of women, it's assumption of Vietnam-style conflicts, it's cardboard ubermensch heroes, etc."
5,execllent prequele to Dorsai,I have read and reread this story countless times. The structure of this book is very similar to dorsai right down to embarrassing moments on a spaceship. The perspective is very different though. Cletus is a gimpy war veteran with an desk job in the western alliance and some strange theories about warfare. What is he doing goading one of the leaders of the eastern alliance into a personal battle of wits?.
2,"Good book, not so good presentation","My low rating is for presentation, not content. This story has always been a favorite--big ideas acted out between interesting individuals. I consider it one of Gordon Dickson's best and was happy to see it in Kindle format. I'm highly disappointed by the poor manuscript editing in the Kindle edition. (""Airear"" for ""aircar""? Really?) I'm loathe to spend more money on Kindle editions if the quality of this book is an indication of things to come."
3,"good actors, but overall very weak movie","I rented this because I was drawn to the unique storyline and because I love kate and demian.however, the plot was pretty weak, which caused the actors to be less than incredible and instead give pretty forgettable performances. my guess is that the directing was not as good as it could have been, which compromised the overall impact of the movie.I recommend it to watch but not to buy."
1,Muy horrible,"No me gusta. Es una mala representación de Bolivia. No tiene sentido.I did not like this movie at all. It has a bad image for Bolivia. It was not written well, had no real theme or point. It is full of stereotypes."
5,An exemplary treatise on modern Christian discernment!,"In the Olivet Discourse, when Jesus' disciples asked Him what would be the signs of the end of the world and of His return, His first response was, ""See to it that no man deceives you!"" Many books over recent years have chronicled the rise of natural disasters, one-world government preparation, and the coming ""Mark of the Beast"", but few if any have addressed the very first sign that Jesus said would mark the nearness of his return: unprecedented spiritual deception!Hunt and McMahon expose ancient witchcraft and sorcery as they are repackaged in modern, pseudo-scientific terminology and passed off to undiscerning Christians as the latest in ""self-help"" or ""personal development"" techniques.The authors place all the modern spiritual deception in the context of Bible prophecy and how it will play into the hands of the coming Antichrist, the one-world government, and the apostasy of the Christian church."
2,Discernment needed,"The first time I read this book I was reading as an Arminian Dispensationalist. Almost a year and a half later I'm Calvinistic and Post-millennial. Hunt's book is good in one way and bad in another. It's good because he encourages discerning New Age techniques that are infiltrating the Christian Church. It's bad because he poses it within the context of an erroneous soteriology (doctrine of salvation) and eschatology (doctrine of ""last things""). Hunt's prescription for the problem: throw up the white flag in surrender in this inevitable apostasy and wait for Jesus to save us in the Rapture. A better prescription is found in the book ""The Reduction of Christianity: A Biblical Response to Dave Hunt"" by Gary Demar."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK!,"I am glad I read past the first review. It is interesting that the scope of the book focuses on the ""falling away"", or the apostasy, of the Church in the end times due to mass deceptions. I think it's safe to say that whether or not one is already a victim of this deception determines how you will feel about this book.It's unflinching in its honesty, it's straigtforward, and for any reader who is interested in just how subtle (keep in mind that the Bible says that Satan is the most 'subtil') this apostasy is. It's already here, and you will be surprised at some of the facts.BUY IT AND BE FOREWARNED.Excellent book."
1,This Kind of Illogical Attack Has to Stop!!!,Mr. Hunt in this and in his sequel has managed to bring the Church to yet another low. These books are not well thought through. The scholarship is questionable. The quotes are generally out of context or twisted. The theology is laughable. There is nothing to commend this book with.
1,worst sort of book,"i rated this book as one star because i could not go lower.it is the worst sort of negativity i could find on religion, Jesus or anything of the sort connected with God.jesus would be appalled.this author speaks of the seduction of christianity, and yet he is the negativity that he warns of.don't waste your money. you will be sorely disappointed if you love the bible, love jesus and thought he was a rebel, a scholar, a god loving person and a perfected soul.this book is seriously derranged."
1,I am no longer a fan of Dave Hunt or T.A. McMahon.,"John F. MacArthur's book ""Charistmatic Chaos"" has helped me revaluate the dake-bonoist doctrine expressed by this work. My previous endorsements must be considered null and void. I cannot promote the errors within. I don't care the authors are ""spiritual stepbrothers."""
4,Super great stroller!!!!,"I love this stoller. I only have one baby that is 16 months and it is very helpful to me. I love that if he is sleep and I need to run to the store I do not have to worry about a shopping cart because of the extendable basket. The stroller allows him to recline and for me to do my shopping with no problems. The ride is very smooth and the control is great. I love the way it has so much storage.The only problem is if you do need to use it for a newborn and an older child, the older child can not sit down. The child can only stand. You have to recline the front seat to get the car seat onto the stroller. Which sort of sucks if you have a yound toddler that needs to be belted into that back seat. It is also a little heavy to lift in and out of your car."
4,Great Stroller,"I disagree with the first review of this stroller. Yes, it is slightly heavy BUT a toddler does have space to stand when the infant seat is in place. My daughter is five and has plenty of room to stand and can even sit on the edge of the seat when her sister is in the front seat in her infant carrier. I get compliments every time I have the stroller out. My only complaints are that either the front seat is reclined or sitting straight up-----there is no in between-----and the sun shade is not detachable. Other than that I love this stroller."
2,Not for the vertically challenged!!!,The first thing about this stroller is the weight....it is very heavy compared to other strollers.The second is the height of the handle.I'm 5'2 and the handle hits me right in the chest.It's hard to push a stroller with your arms up at chest level.The third is that it is misleading that you can use it with an infant seat because you can't!!!You have to recline the seat all the way back to fit the car seat on it then there is no room on the back for your toddler to sit or stand.The only good thing about it is the size of the storage basket.There has to be better products out there!!!
2,hard to maneuver,"We bought this for our three year old and newborn. When the baby is in his carseat, my daughter can't sit on the back seat, she can only stand. I tried pushing my daughter while seated in the front, without the baby in it and was unable to get it to go anywhere. My husband had trouble with it too. We ended up returning it. Maybe it might have worked once my son was able to sit up, but I didn't want to have to wait six months to use the stroller."
2,too complicated,"I was so excited when we first got this stroller. It is very easy to close, it rolls without any effort, and it turns without any problems. The problem is with the hood, It is flimsy and flops every which way. If you try to adjust it, it flops forward and covers the entire front. It will fall backwards to if all the snaps are not in place. When the snaps are in place though, it does not fully cover the child in the front. Also the tray opens in the middle and does not stay shut unless there is an infant seat attached to it. There are soooo many straps, snaps, and hooks, it is quite difficult to figure out. Also the front seat is adjusted with a dial and it does not stay up all the time. It will fall back when you least expect it."
1,Ridiculous Price,"Yes, this is a good stroller, but the price being asked for it is ridiculous. I have one and have been happy with it, but there is no way that it is worth $300, especially in this economy. It retailed for around $125 (I paid $115) and I see them occasionally on e-bay for under $100. Do yourself a favor and if you really want one of these do not pay the +$300 they are asking and just shop around. There are also plenty of really good tandem strollers from other manufacturers for sale here on Amazon that are much more reasonable in price."
5,It Works!,I've recently decided to start using homeopathic methods and medicines as much as possible. I knew my cat had a UTI and rather than go through all the trauma and expense of taking her to the vet I thought I'd give this a try. This along with prayer worked! I used the suggestion of another reviewer and disolved the pellets in a bit of water and used a childs medicine syringe to give it to her. She rebounded within a few days.
1,Do Not Recommend,The positive reviews on Amazon and on this product's website did not reflect my experience. I purchased this for my neutered male cat because he experienced a UTI and I wanted to prevent future issues. My cat is now in the veterinary hospital due to a blockage which was five days after I started him on the UTI-Free.
1,not worth it,Didn't work for my cats UTI - Had to take her to vet and ending up spending $200 on top of the $40 I paid for this.
2,"Caution! It's tiny pellets, not liquid drops!","The product description really should specify the FORM of the medicine. I was surprised to open my package, find no correspondence, a sticky label slapped over the directions (that I had to peel off so I could read directions) & then... It was NOT a liquid... It was tiny pellets!Trying to get ""a large pinch"" of these pellets into my cat's mouth-- & getting her to swallow it? Ha! Fail! So, I don't know yet if the stuff works, or not!Another user review suggested dissolving the pellets in a 1/2 teaspoon it 1 teaspoon of water & draw that up into a syringe (w/o needle, of course) & squirting that into the car's mouth. Thank you to that reviewer for the suggestion.I'm frustrated that the vendor didn't include a note thanking me for my order or giving better instruction or anything. And VERY frustrated that it wasn't a liquid. Really-- come up with a more thorough description of your product!!"
1,hard to give and did not work :(,I was desperate. Nothing seemed to work. My poor cat. I ordered this. Gave it 2 weeks....and nothing. Dont waste your money. Im going to order uromaxx now. Wish me luck.
2,Not sure if it's helping or not,"I bought this product when my 14-year old female cat started displaying symptoms of a urinary tract infection. I didn't want to put her through the stress of a veterinarian visit and antibiotics, so I researched online trying to find a homeopathic product that might help. I read great reviews about this PetAlive product so I purchased it. The product arrived quickly and I immediately started administering it to my cat.I very much like the idea of a homeopathic pet medicine, but more granules landed in her fur (and all around her!) than in her mouth. It's difficult to administer, even with a pet who doesn't fight you. So in that way, you end up wasting a lot of the product. As far as the effectiveness goes, at first it seemed like it helped. But here we are a month later and her symptoms of infection are stronger than ever. I'm still giving her the granules, but am also researching vets because I think we're going to have to end up going that route anyway."
5,Very Happy with my Purchase,"The provider has a fast service, and the product was wonderful. My dog was notably good after the third dose. Thanks."
1,NOT Vet approved!!!!,"I have a very well respected Vet that I have gone to for several years and has always taken amazing care of my animals. I brought in this item for her to look at and make sure it was safe for my dog (since she has been plagued with several UTI's). She glanced over them quickly and stated that she would need some time for further investigate the ingredients because nothing was standing out as a familiar ingredient used for UTI relief or treatment. After researching the product and its ingredients, she called me to let me know that there was NOTHING in the product that would be beneficial for my dogs UTI's. So, I threw it away. She did note that the Cranberry Relief powder that I bought was an excellent choice to help her because of its ingredients. Just a warning to not buy this product because the ingredients are lacking in the beneficial department."
2,Jolson Book,"This book has a nice cover, but the photos are the worst possible quality! They are mostly black smudges. I paid a lot for this book and was very disappointed."
4,Great songwriting,"Christine's new album, not unlike her solo album from the 80's has great songwriting...particularly the first five songs on the disk. Musically it is not very challenging...but if you like her voice and think that she is a GREAT songwriter, as I do, you NEED to get this album."
3,3 Stars just for showing her face!,"OK, I consider myself one of the consumate fans since the 70's and could get really critical here but I will show alittle respect and not be too harsh.Yes, she sounds great.....no this is not her best songwriting ( ala ""booze"" ) and yes the comparisons to FM are unmistakable on a few tracks but unfortunately there are too many throw away tracks.Friend, You Are, Northern Star & Giving It Back should have been on FM's 2003, SAY YOU WILL and we wouldn't be here leaving disapointing reviews.Chris, come back to us"
3,Hmmm....,"Overall this is a good collection of songs but overall the CD is rather weak. It's good for some easy listening but it does wear thin after a while. Christine just needs Stevie and Lindsey, it's as simple as that. By herself she's similar to a watered down drink, still good but not as could as it used to be."
3,Not Bad; Not Good. Just there...,"This is not a bad CD. Truth is, I've got nothing really negative to say about it. It's kind of pleasant, in fact. But that's about all the further I can go. Technically, it's as pro as it gets. But in the end, it lacks something, a spark perhaps. Odds are that a year from now you'll find this in your collection and not remember a single thing about it. Like I said, it's not bad; not good. It's just there. And I'm kinda disappointed."
4,Nice return to form with something else...,"I also picked this up overseas when it first came out and havehad it in the mix since mid July. Nice change of pace. Chris has a wayof looking at life through her songwriting, hell, shes now in her early 60's, she sounds great and give us songs from ""this"" time in her lifeand it rocks and soothes and has many touches of her contributions to that band she once was such a big part of. Hernephew helps out and give these songs some great sounds.I don't look for her to be put out to pasture anytime soon, shestill has much to offer and is a classic performer. This one grows on you if you just take the time to listen to it morethan once. Great vocalist."
2,BORING midstream adult contemporary,"Initially, I was afraid that Christine McVie would be sorely missed on Fleetwood Mac's Last effort, 2003's ""Say You Will"". After hearing this, I'm glad she wasn't involved in the Mac project at all. The voice is still there but unlike Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham, the song writing has become sub-standard. The songs are pretty, but COMPLETELY forgettable. If you haven't already done so, I suggest purchasing the last fleetwood Mac disc or Stevie's SPECTACULAR 2001 effort ""Trouble in Shangri-la""...now there's something to sink your teeth into."
2,Okay,Cute idea and looks nice sitting on the kitchen sink. The problem is the lid rusts and isn't tight enough at the top which makes it leak all the time.
3,"Too much reminiscing, and what was the point?","Any reader can tell that Jeff Crook loves the Dragonlance Chronicles. Lord Gunthar is by now a senile old coot who is constantly reminiscing about events in Dragons of Winter Night, and the gully dwarf joke about ""not more than two"" gets just a LITTLE overused. For a novel so thin on content, Jeff Crook wastes too much time on allusions to past events, especially when they have little bearing on the present.I thought the book would be about the Knights of Solamnia and Takhisis banding together. Of course, treachery amongst the knights is to be expected in the plot. But by the ending, nothing is resolved, and that really brought down a book that was going OK.The novel is a good first effort, but with so little content and such a thin and disappointing conclusion (Jeff Crook or his editor's fault, we'll never know), the Rose and the Skull is an unsatisfying read."
2,"It's okay, and worth a look.","I love to read Dragonlance Books, and I either buy everyone that comes out or borrow them from friends. This one was a borrow. The writing wasn't too bad--especially since I believe this was the author's first book. That means his next ones should be better. The plot started slow, but it picked up by the end of the first quarter of the book. I would have liked to see a little more development with some of the secondary characters. Anyway, it's worth a look!"
3,It was missing something,"Don't get me wrong, this book was worth reading but there were a few things that bugged me in it. First of all the Gully Dwarves were in a full half of this book and after awhile the jokes about the number two got old and annoying. And then there were the fight scenes; they really weren't there. When I picked up this book I expected to have some really big battles play out in front of me, but that's not how it worked out. Crook used past tense on the battles so you really didn't get to read about any huge action scenes, just a small fight here or there.There are pluses to this book however. The Dark Elf Knight of Takhisis Valian Escu was an interesting character and I personally would like to see a Dragonlance book that focuses only on him and his life after the Rose and the Skull. And also it was nice to see some of Pyrothraxus the Great Red Dragon of Mt. Nevermind."
2,"Well written and engaging, yet an insult to fans of the Solamnic Knighthood","This is essencially a warning to anyone who is a fan of Dragonlance and of the Solamnic Knighthood- If you got emotional when Sturm Brightblade fell at the High Clerist Tower, do not read this book.While, as I stated, it is well written by a talented author and is fairly engaging and a good read overall, there are plot points and events in this book that are downright absurd when in the context of the Solamnic Knighthood.I don't want to give anything away with spoilers, so I'll simply say that events nearly lead the Knighthood to doing two things that is simply implausible and downright blasphemus."
3,Good game!,"There should be more games like this, what would be great is if they improved the graphics and made it for GBA. I actually got this when I got my GBA. It is really fun, and not too hard to figure out. This is especially recommended to any Tomb Raider fans. Plus, I got this for a pretty good price.Pros:1) Pretty good price (used anyway)2) Lots of puzzles, not to easy nor to hard to figure out3) People with GBC still can play it4) Fairly good graphicsCons:1) Some controls are difficult2) Only one slot for one saved game3) Some people may get bored early in the game"
5,stays on the dog,"This is a great product, and becoming hard to find. I like these pajamas because of the long sleeves. It stays on the dog. We do have to roll up the back legs to keep them on, but even when the dog gets out of the back legs, the pajamas stay on the front legs and cover and keep the dog warm. The pajamas shrink in the wash, so our x-small lavendar pajamas are a tight fit now, but the small blue pajamas work well for our 5# and 6# chihuahuas."
4,Dog pajamas,"My dog looks adorable in these! They are lightweight and comfortable, and all around great."
4,Janet Jackson grown up(sorta),I enjoyed the concerts very much. The parts I did not enjoy were the childish segments designed for 5 year olds. Other than that good product for the money.
3,Not as fun as I thought.,"Pros -+ Smash Court Tennis in your palm+ nice menus+ char creation and levelling up is fun and rewardingCons -- Tennis feels silly. Chars move like they're 90year olds. Stumbling slowly- Animations are off. Sometimes it clearly doesn't hit the racket but it still goes to other side- same animation of fist pump after every point, making it very annoying- can't get depth in shots or precision at all. not like VT3 at all- VT3 is a far superior offering than SCT3 on PSP ( although SCT2 on PS2 was awesome )- mini games are fun for 20mins.overall, I'm at bit disappointed with SCT3. I was expecting a lot more.gameplay - 6/10sound - 5/10 -- ball hit doesn't convey force rendered. sound isn't rich. commentator at the start is annoying. ( ridge racer'esque )graphics - 7/10 -- decent for PSP. not very impressive, but not shabby eithervalue - 6.5/10 -- if you love tennis, you'll be happy with it, else nottilt - 7/10 -- simply because I love and support tennis games."
3,Best Tennis Game around,"I play this game all the time, mostly because Rafael Nadal is feautured. There are 8 male & 8 female players, recognizable to most fans. Although the skills they attribute to some players are not accurate. Roger Federer doesn't have much power in his ground strokes or moves that well, Andy Roddick is not nearly that fast and Feliciano Lopez isn't as accurate as they made him out to be. There are other small errors, but still fun to play. I played the tournament and after a few weeks, became #1. I just play the exhibitions now and alternate locations (playing as either Rafa or Roger). It would be better if they had more tour players in the tournament, it gets boring playing the same players. And the draw never makes sense, you could be playing several top ten players in a row and also be a top ten player. That never happens in a grand slam. Also, it's tough to play back to back, doubles or mixed and singles without running out of juice."
3,Puppy in my pocket,The ring is great but the hair clips are hard to get to stay in because the pups pull them down. My daughter loves her ring and changing the puppies that she wears
1,Dangerous Shampoo for pets!,"This is a very dangerous shampoo to use for your pets. This product contains Pyrethrum, which is deadly to animals; especially cats. There are many all natural alternatives available. Here are some great natural flea remedies, [...]"
3,Okay..not great,"We hosted a second new year's eve party using another murder mystery party game. The first one was awesome (Pasta, Pistols, Passion) and for this one we had high expectations. Though we totally transformed our home into a studio 54 complete with strobe lights, disco ball, sleazy lounge-esque disco, bar, etc..the script was not nearly as entertaining nor did the plot flow as smoothly as I though it could. Everyone showed up in fantastic costumes but I think this one fell short of great! I recommend the Pasta, Pistols and Passion one before this one. I am not sure we could have done anything differently to make this one work better. We had the same people from the previous year and really put a lot into the set. We did use their recommendations on music and food to make the scene more befitting of 1979 (all of us remember that year!)....My advice is to try another one of these games before you buy this one."
4,Get Down Tonight!,"Break out the polyester and platform shoes! My husband and I have thrown several murder mystery parties and this is by far our favorite! I would warn those out there this game is more PG 13. We bought a disco ball and threw on some groovy music to dance to. All of the costumes were great! Some reviews seem to not like the extra characters (Sunny and Share) because they don't have as much of a part as the main characters. I would encourage you to give these parts to guests who will get the crowd involved such as reenacting the crime scene, strip searches, and maybe Andy's streaking episode? The only negative thing about this game is the murderer was just blurted out at the end of the CD. I would recommend having everyone read their final statements and take a guess at who the killer is before you play the last CD part. Still, so much fun!"
3,Great for a crowd,"A group of secretaries did this for a Bosses' Day party. We gave the characters to the Bosses, but all dressed up in a Disco style. We ""helped"" our Bosses review the clues and come to a conclusion. There were 15 of us and we all had a great time."
3,Similar to Autozone pads,"I expected perceiveable increases in braking performance compared to the Autozone, Duralast Gold pads ($40), but I was dissappointed. The pads work fine, but I don't think they are worth $100. If you want/need better performance I'd try their next level up perfomance pad. I probably won't get these pads again."
5,EXCELLENT.,"Instalados en un Corvette C4 en Medellin Colombia, excelente producto silencioso, sin polvillo y muy buen agarre.lo Recomiendo totalmente."
4,A Four Star General Discussion of Dog Breeds,"The ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DOG BREEDS is full of interesting facts and pictures. It is a nice collection for a coffee table. Now it can be obtained at little expense.There are disappointments though. Sometimes the pictures are not labeled. There are articles discussing many breeds at once. The reader is left to guess which breed is featured in the picture.Since poodles are very popular, they should be discussed as a separate category. Instead, they are mentioned incidentally. Poodles are fine dogs and their popularity does not lessen their value.There seems to be an emphasis on the less comon breeds of dogs. While it does add to our education about dogs, it is not representative of the kinds of dogs people have and want to read about.Anyway, it is a fun book to pick up and read."
4,"""Theatre of Remembrance""","Feinberg's work is an excellent collection of biographical data and Tabori's antecdotes. Her writing is captivating, although at times her analysis is not quite clear or simply not complete. However, she does offer a huge sampling of themes prevalent in Tabori's work. The book is a good source for Taboriisms and feeling Tabori's spirit."
2,Disappointing,"I have used Lonely Planet guides for several years, and have found them to be uniformly excellent -- except for this one. The time estimates given for various hikes with which I am familiar are way off. I am suspicious of the book's accuracy, and wonder whether the persons who authored the book actually did the described hikes. There are also gratuitously sniffy descriptions sprinkled throughout the text, such as ""the poor food and urban sprawl characteristic of the Rocky Mountain region"" -- remember, however, that the book's authors are British. Consider other books written by local writers/hikers who actually know the trails."
2,Kurosawa Wept,"Technically, the film is ""kinetic"" (what any film should be), psychologically it is cartoon, intellectually it is deplorable. It is as if Kurosawa had recovered from a terrible head injury and began making films from his spleen. Flashy and uncompelling, Kitano's work is more sophisticated than Woo's, which should get him a lucrative Hollywood contract. What it gets me is a headache. To any of the people who praised this film to the skies, I ask ""Are you acquainted with the name Ozu? Mizoguchi? Naruse? Teshigahara? Kobayashi, even?"" If the answer is ""yes,"" then you cannot condone the continued irritation of someone like Kitano. And one more question, the one perennially asked of so-called modern art: can the term 'beauty' be redefined by its opposite?"
1,THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!,"Dull, boring , and pointless. These are the three words which describe ""Fireworks"". This film had no plot, it dragged on for over an hour and I would recommend it toany one suffering from insomnia."
5,amazingly beautiful,"Hana-bi is a good example of an image-based movie, you can understand what is going on in the story by just watching the images, I think more than 75 percent of the film is silent (no dialogue). This is the first cop movie that actually made me feel so lonely and alienated(maybe hana-bi should not be classified as a cop movie), at the same time, learn to appreciate small moments in life a lot more."
2,"Great Film, Disgusting Transfer","Why am i writing this review? I guess the only reasons are to state what a great masterpiece not only of Kitano's work, but of cinema this movie is, and to state my disgust at the insulting DVD quality of this. Its not DVD quality, and it certainly does not live up to the beautiful 35mm picture. The cheap third rate transfer renders everyhting under-exposed, de-saturated and ""viedeo-y"". When the camer pans, for instance, it looks like you're watching a DV recording of Hana-bi on a tv set. you see the digital lines, for Christ sake! Sadly, the options are slim. One can get the VHS which is pan and scanned, or deal with this ONLY friggin' region 1 DVD. HIGHLY RECOMENDED FILM, however, beware of an aweful and unacceptable transfer. I lost much, if not all respect for New Yoker Films. its a mockery to all lovers of movies."
1,Masterpiece ruined by atrocious transfer,"It is imperative that you avoid this disastrous release. Takeshi Kitano's masterpiece is completely ruined by an appaling transfer. The sound and extras are good but the transfer wrecks what would otherwise be a fine DVD release. Again, I urge you to avoid this disgusting release."
5,You want to mess with Kitano?,"This is a beautiful and tender movie. Kitano is that sometimes gangster, sometimes policeman that we all love because he is so tough and sexy despite the fact that he is neither at first glance and because he is doomed to face life at its most basic and extreme. This is Japanese cinema at its most direct, and here we have an intimate glance at Kitano's beautiful paintings, that he made during a convalescence from a terrible motorcycle accident. This is a great movie to begin a love affair with Japanese cinema and culture, and with the awesome Kitano."
2,Write errors.,"Nikon D2x, many write errors. Lexar said to reformat the card, which I did. I still get an occasional write error."
4,"Lexar, please keep the software off the product","I have owned 1GB Lexar CF cards previously and they have always performed fine. So when I stepped up to the higher capacity card I was pleased to purchase Lexar once again. I should point out that unlike nearly all other useres of these cards, I do not use them for digital photography, but instead use them for high-quality audio recording. So my comments come from there. Lexar decided to stick some PC-based digital photography software on these cards which caused my recorder some problems. Fortunately, I was able to remove the card wipe my recroder hard drive clean and then take the card to my computer and wipe out by way of a clean format, the CF card before ujsing it in my recorder once more. Needless to say this was all a pain in the butt! Lexar... please don't stick software on your cards!!! Because of this issue, I have decided to purchase SanDisk cards next time around."
1,Not Write Acceleration,"The Compact Flash Card does not have the "" Wa"" Write Acceleration feature, this is deceptive. Look else where if you want the Wa feature."
2,Go with SanDisk,"Lexar compact flash cards are adequate and that's about as much as I can say for them. I have found that they fail within a year or two. They are slower than SanDisk cards. (This is verified by third party tests. Do a google search for something like ""compact flash card review"" or ""test"".)The killer for me was when I found dropouts in a sequence of photos. The card had selectively stored some images and not others. Most of my images were lost. I tested the Lexar card versus my SanDisk cards. The Lexar card was the problem."
1,Totally deceptive,"The Compact Flash Card DOES NOT have the "" Wa"" Write Acceleration feature, this is deceptive. Looking right at the picture it is feature on the picture. The NON Wa are a totally different look."
1,not WA like a lot of others,"Bought the 8 GB at 17th street - but they did not send the WA card. I called them up and they said that all Lexar cards are now WA but it is not noted on the card anymore. Unfortunately I can't verify it. Kept card instead of going through the hassle of returning. But I could have gotten the ""non WA"" card cheaper elsewhere!"
5,Sci-Fi classic,"As a child I always heard about the story and radio broadcast, and I had the 2 CD musical version created in the 70s. I never read the book, and I was always curious about the story and broadcast. This book is exactly what I wanted - the H.G. Wells original story, the radio adaptation text and extras like the press conference the day after, and a CD with the broadcast. Fabulous compilation!"
5,Invasion Never Felt So Good!,"After finding this book in a local library and checking it out, I soon realized that I had to have my very own copy. So, I jumped onto Amazon and thankfully found one! For those who love classic War of the Worlds, this book is a huge slice of wonderful. I was thrilled with the CD that came with the book, too. This is a great resource and it would make a fine product for a Sci-Fi literature and / or media class.Martians everywhere! The Invasion comes to you in the book and in the sounds. Worth the price!"
4,A throwback to the comics of the 1910s,"Imagine a comic strip created at the very end of the 20th century that greatly resembles the zany style of the classic funnies from the turn of the century. Must've made a very bittersweet nostalgic trip for the old-timers who were quite terrified of the looming Y2K as well as a new curiosity for the younger generations. Drawn in very simple shapes and written with simple gags, ""Mutts"" features a happy-go-lucky alley cat and his innocent-looking canine buddy who go out on the night to raid trash cans, break into a local butcher shoppe, perform long serenades to the full moon, and occasionally get whisked off into colorful fantasy adventures complete with a Buster-Brownesque punchline. A bit pretentious kind of ""homage"" to ""the good ole days"", but still a pretty amusing pastime nevertheless."
3,"DirectTV, not Tivo","This is actually a DirectTV replacement controller, not a Tivo OEM controller. A little lighter and significantly more slippery than the original Series 2 controller from Tivo - probably due to component count reduction and a change in plastic formulation. But it's 100% compatible with my Tivo."
5,Good replacment.,My old TiVo remote bit the dust and this was the exact replacement I needed. Got used to the layout and did not want to try to fuss with one of those universal remotes.
3,This isn't really a TiVO remote but it does the job...,"It's a Direct TV TiVO remote so the controls are not identical to our series 2 TiVo remote that came with the system or others that we've purchased before. It does the job, but programming it to work with our TV wasn't quite what we were used to. Since we're limping along an ancient Series 2 TiVo and the kids keep losing or damaging remotes, beggars can't be too choosy!"
1,It doesn't work,"I ordered this ""replacement remote"" for my Tivo....but it doesn't work. You can't read the numbers on it and even though it listed it to be in good condition, it most definately wasn't. Guess I learned a valuable lesson...ask for better pictures!"
5,Essential Tab Book,"First, I can vouch for the accuracy of the tablature as stated by the reviewer below. Second, I'm a young guitarist in my twenties who plays in a 60's sounding garage rock band that's influenced by early Kinks, Sonics, Stones, and The Beach Boys music. Chuck Berry's music is an indispensable gateway to opening up the fret board and will really help you understand the dynamics of Rock & Roll music. There's songs in here that would greatly benefit a beginner, and songs that will either challenge or give satisfaction to more advanced guitarists. If given propper study you shouldn't have any problem playing the 12 bar blues structure, and hopefully figuring out your own soloing methods for rock and roll music. Buy this book, it's cheaper than guitar lessons and could help your playing move up to the next level."
5,Good if you mean,"Order did arrived great.The book is good, as an introduction that teaches all the tricks in the musics and so it is very easy to know the play, yeat as you'll see, chuck berry did had good hands - that is the hard part of all musics in the books."
3,Works for the 1st 6 months,"I purchased this watch and was very happy with it during the first 6 months. It provided consistent and accurate readings and was compatible with the Gyms treadmills. After 6 months I started noticing that the monitor took several minutes to display a heart rate on the watch. I replaced the battery thinking that was the culprit. The watch still takes anywhere from 5-15 minutes before displaying a reading. When it eventually does display one it has huge swings. It's at 155 one minute, then at 260, then back to 135....it has come to the point where it is completely unreliable and I'm now researching for another monitor. I would have thought it was somehting with the way it was fitting on my chest, if it wasn't for the fact that I've worn it the same way since I've got it and it worked great for 6 months. It's too bad because I enjoyed it while it lasted."
1,Don't buy,"I bought a Nike Triax C5 heart rate monitor watch a year ago. The strap is already falling apart near the bezel. The watch has a 2 yr warranty but do not cover the strap or the crystal, even if the problem is poor workmanship."
4,Perfect and functional,I have been using the triax C5 for about a year and a half and had no problems whatsoever. Using it at least 4 times a week for Tae-Bo and mountain biking. excellent price/quality.
3,Nike Triax C5 Heart Rate Monitor,"I am some what pleased with the watch, at times the watch has trouble staying with my heart rate and when that happens it shows a really low heart rate."
4,Needs More,"From what i have read of this book it is very good, networking topics are very clear and in depth. Only problems i see with this book is that it talks about 10Mbps networks, but the standard is more and more going to 100Mbps, and soon to be 1000Mbps. And the second problem is that it doesn't cover Windows NT 4.0 Workstation, which like NT Server it is not exactly the same, OS. But all in all this a very good book very informative. I recommended it to anyone trying to get into networking, and even if you know networking, like my self this book is very good, but if you do not know NT Server this is the book to start with. Very Good Book in the end"
1,Hole in the 8-BAll,"Normally, the purchased products from Amazon are the best not this time. There was a small hole in the 8-Ball which meant the fluid and the triangle were missing from the bottom of it. I understand used but this was ridiculous. Again, I rave about my purchases but unfortunately not this time around. Dissatifised completely."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,Don't Waste your money on a stand when you can buy a game such as Top Gun or Gran Turismo 3!
4,"Odd Choices, Great Music","Some of the artist choices on this are odd - why no Bob Dylan or Nirvana? That said, I was very impressed with the performances. This is an album of great music."
2,One good track,Ok - maybe two good tracks.Stevie Ray Vaughan opens the album with a powerful voice and a 12 string accoustic. We miss you Stevie.But for me the album is worth it for the blues version of Are You Gonna Go My Way by Lennie Kravitz.Why not just download those tracks from iTunes.
3,business owner,"The lights are great for our use, but as has been the problem for the last month or so, there is only ONE mounting bracket in the box with the lights. Two are needed.I had to contact the manufacturer to get the other brackets. This is a recurring problem since it seems like there had been a breakdown in qaulity control.Pilot is aware of the natinwide problem."
1,Total Misrepresentation,"This ""book"" was totally misrepresented. It is nothing more than a pamphlet and contains a grand total of 15 recipies for the sum of $38.00. I used to own the original cookbook that Vincent Price wrote and thought it would have at least 25% of it's recipies when advertised as ""Favorites from A Treasury of Great Recipies"". A better description of the book should be required. Buyer Beware on this one."
4,Excellent-wonderful resource,This was an excellent book & I found it a valuable resource tool. She has detailed her banner & dance ministry....there are several full color pages of banners & dance outfits. She also has some wonderful suggestions for keeping your ministry on the right track. I loved this book & would reccomend it highly to those who have a dance ministry or are looking to start one.
4,2 qt. cast iron sauce pot,"This is just what I wanted. It had to have additional seasoning but other than that it is great. I'm enjoying the fresh vegetables cooked in it fresh from the garden. Oh yes, A little bacon drippings help also. A VERY GOOD product at a good price. E. J."
1,Already been sent to re-cycling,"First issue, thought this was made in Louisiana but actually made in China. Second issue, I did not want to waste it so i scrubbed very clean and seasoned. It responded to the seasoning process (same as used on quality cookware by Lodge) by turning very sticky and flaky. I really wish Lodge made more products in this size, will have to go with stainless (US) or enamel lined cast iron (French).Sorry, but can't recommend this."
3,"Cast Iron Sauce Pot is made in China, and rough inside","I purchased two cast iron pots from this company, this one and a 1 quart dutch oven. Both of them are rough inside, and the seasoning is questionable as they rusted above the water line when water was boiled in them. The size is perfect for my purposes, but I'm not sure how likely I would be to cook food in them. They're great for warming a baby bottle in water, or heating a can in water, but I wouldn't advocate anything else until I knew more about the metal content."
1,Unrelenting,Unrelentingly slow. Unhappy. Persistently grim. Much shot in long-shot which facilitates the viewer's deep disconnection with plot and enhances alienation from characters and theme.Conspicuously humorless.
2,Long day's journey into trite,"There are so many wonderful slow-paced movies out there, why waste your time on this one. An old man has no friends other than his dead wife. On what he thinks is his last day on the planet, he mopes about, reminiscing. Even the injection of a troubled boy takes too long to have much effect on Mr. Morosity.I know the Greek history, and cinematography. The long takes are indeed interesting, and the only interesting thing about this movie other than Ganz's fine acting. The transfer, BTW, is execrable.The extra film of the academic explaining the symbolic and literary antecedents was amusing and annoying: the former for its silly professorialisms; the latter for forcing ill-fitting and ultimately unnecessary parallels with Homer's Odyssey on the story.One other element of merit, however: glimpses of the desperate refugee underclass and undercurrent of human trafficking.If you like slow, predictable downers and deserted, half-constructed buildings, this film is for you!"
2,The Ottoman Empire & Greece,"Hey, how come I'm the only one to review this film so far? The subtitles failed at the end. It didn't matter because I think the director had no idea how to end the film. It was a big muddle with lots of wonderful scenery. The pace was often excruciatingly slow with slow long pans to nothing special. It was kind of like film students made this film. The poet with the stovepipe hat who came back from Italy to fight the ottoman empire was too too boring. But Greece was just lovely. Is there really a fence around Albania? Why were those people hanging on the fence? Was the point of the story that the guy spent too much time on the job? The daughter sure turned out to be a stinker."
1,Worst movie I have seen in 10 years.,"I kept waiting for something to happen that I could care about. But after 60 minutes of drivel, I had to bail."
5,Amazing!,"I saw this film as part of my new european cinema class at school and I was simply taken away by the images in the film. The other thing that suck with me was the beautiful music in the film, the sound is simple and at the same time adds so much meaning. If you haven't seen Eternity and a Day go see it, and enjoy the music long after the film."
2,Horrible edition - mistakes galore!!!,"This book would have been a pleasure to read - the content is interesting and well written, but the edition is unbelievably bad...a paragraph from somewhere else in the book is printed halfway down the page, totally unrelated to anything else, then the copy picks up from somewhere other than where it left off; a poem stops at the bottom of the page only to start up 3 pages later with material in between that begins out of nowhere. Pages are left out causing a huge gap in the sequence of events. These errors happen over and over again throughout the book, making reading an entirely frustrating experience."
2,i didn't really like this book,"I thought that this book was very harsh and critical of some groups of people. I thought that it was quite insulting to men and whites. I thought it was well writtten, and i loved the first couple sections about Walker's ideas of activism rooted in love, but i found that as the book progressed it seemed to become more of a praise of certain kinds of people rather than praising all people and loving all people like it was claimed earlier in the book. Overall, Walker had good ideas, I just found that sometime they were expressed in a manner of insult."
3,Well I bought 2,"I purchased two at one million dollars each. It looks as if my investment has not paid off.Will sell for 100,000 US dollars."
3,doesn't work with my Playstation,"I've been searching for a regular keyboard for a long time to use with my PS2. This one claims to work, but Auto Modelestia does not work with it. I wanted something to chat with while I was driving with my online friends. The keyboard itself is very nice though. I really like the L-Type Enter Key, because I have arthritus. Sometimes it makes too much noise and my cat can't sleep. Other than that, I'd give it an 8 out of 10."
3,Pepper Mill looks better than it operates,"I thought by paying more, I'd get a good product. However, you're mostly paying for the looks. This mill doesn't grind the pepper well enough and is infact no better than cheaper models out there. Much of the seed is just cracked in two instead of being ground finer.I wouldn't recommend this product, unless you just want something nice sitting on your dining room table."
5,"A fresh sound, unpretentious like clean,tough, early country","A year from now a lot of other artists will have caught on to this sound and it will be one of the next big things. It's a steamy sort of country sound, but not like the syrupy over-produced stuff we're used to out of Nashville. It's more like what Hank Williams' band might have sounded like in a bar somewhere in the early 50s with Loretta Lynn sitting in and no mikes or cameras. Check it out."
1,George Forman barbcue,"I'll never buy from Forman again. It worked great for a year but when part of it burnt out, we got ""No parts available"" from them."
1,An excellent example of Politically Correct gibberish.,"This book is an excellent example of Politically Correct elitist nonsense. From the PC arrogance such as not just displaying the Enola Gay because the ""public did not have an adequate understanding with which to view it"" to the ludicrous ""connection"" of American ""homophobia"" due the word ""Gay"" in Enola Gay (!!) to the tie-in with ""Rambo"" movies and our Vietnam experinces, this book trots out every morally bankrupt Leftist cliche that ever existed, and then some. However, it is an EXCELLENT book as typical of the arrogant PC/leftist mind set and ability to ignore reality."
3,Not enough information,I felt this book lacked the necessary information a person would be looking for in a book of this type. Although this book had somewhat detailed information on repairing and replacing the subfloor it had little instruction on installing hardwood and laminate flooring. Don't waste your money on it.
1,Lack of understanding of global scope makes this a poor read,"The lack of global scope in a book about a global network makesthis an incomplete book on this subject. The author does a decent jobof summarizing some of the issues, but fails to acknowlegde that US laws do not apply to servers located in countries outside of the US. This leaves the unknowing reader with the belief that US laws would help the situation. Although this may be what the author wants the reader to believe, it is not an accurate reflection of the situation."
3,A calm assessment of the perils and the glory of the Web.,"If I were a member of the Christian right(I'm not),this is the book I'd want to represent me. As it is, I appreciate the respect afforded my beliefs and I certainly appreciate some of the advice applicable to my grandkids."
5,Even I can understand this book!,"For those of us who are not too computer savy, but want our kids to experience the best, not the worst of what the internet has to offer, Rice's book is the perfect guide. Easy to understand terminology and practical solutions to potential problems, make her book a tool I can use!"
1,"Too preachy, no substance....","This book doesn't teach parents anything they don't already know...The author makes statements designed to frighten parents, without any solutions other than becoming a computer expert. It has too much of a religious bent to it as well...there are far better books out there."
4,Great small group jazz,"Some people may not care much for Dandridge's vocals. When he breaks into scat during ""Nagasaki"", on the 1935-36 collection, his bizarre display of scat singing style may make you squirm. But the backup groups for the two Dandridge collections available from Classics are very tasty indeed, and more than compensate. As the liner notes say, these sessions were assembled on the fly, and they are not rehearsed and polished gems. But they bear testimony to the fact that you can't hold genius down. ""1936"", which is my favorite, includes the incomparable Henry Red Allen( 12 tracks), Teddy Wilson (8 tracks) and Cozy Cole (16 tracks). The first volume, ""1935-36"", has Allen on only 4 tracks, but the always exhilerating Roy Eldridge on 3 tracks. If you can bear with the vocals --heck, maybe you'll even LIKE them, who knows? --these sessions are rewarding mid-thirties small group jazz."
3,Taking it back,"Product is attractive and has plenty of features except the one feature that every home theater system needs: surround sound input. It only has a single pair of stereo RCA inputs. Weak. Apparently the 1050 has optical inputs, but all I need or want is SPDIF input (which the 1050 apparently also lacks). Too bad."
4,Price,"This is a great system, but its cheaper at a number of other stores than it is here. especially if you go to those stores, then you dont have to pay the higher price or the shipping costs. Shop arround, save seventy bucks."
2,Glorified 5 disc CD player,"Has only one HDMI input & NO other digital inputs.All audio features such as speaker balance, speaker level, etc. needs to be done from CD/DVD source. (ie) can't do it while watching Sat. TV. or HD TV.DVD functions such as pan or zoom has to be done via a clumsy on screen menu. I have cheap Phillips system that allows one to do this via remote buttons.The only positive that I have for this system is that the wireless speakers do work fine with no popping or interference.I wish I had not bought this unit!"
4,Beware of WiFi interactions,"Pros:Setup is easy.Sounds fine for the money.Support excellentCons:Only 2 input ports(other than devoted iPod).My Aux input did not work with my TV as per instruction manual, but support (that answered immediately) told me to connect directly to my satellite box--that fixed it.Nonetheless, the wireless rear speakers bombed my WiFi network and made my phone sound like popcorn cooking.I moved my WiFi to channel 11 and bought a new phone (Panasonic Direct 6.0) on a different frequency. Now all functions quite well. But be prepared to do this kind of diddling and don't expect the Disney Land house of the Future where device is self-aware, smart, and simple. (OK, actually not too hard. I'm one of the ""ancient ones"" who did not grow up with the internet, but I did it.)"
2,No External Surround Sound,"Pro's: The unit has fine sound and excellent video when playing standards DVD's. Price is good.Con's: No external surround sound.I expect a Home Theater In a Box (HTIB) to have surround available for more than just the internal functions like playing DVD's. Only Left/Right audio inputs are supplied via the Aux input for connection to a Satellite or Cable box. Digital Optical Audio is reserved for the PT1050, which costs $100 more.If you plan on using this system for TV viewing, save your money and buy something with better capabilities."
2,Not for me,"I've been a big James fan for a lot of years and liked Booth's Bad Angels collaberation. This CD however was a pretty big dissappointment. I threw it in the trash after a couple listens. Who knows, maybe someone else likes it."
5,The Black Hand Gang mystery book,"I read this about 25 years ago and re-ordered it online recently...as a blast from the past. It is a great little book, which I am sure inspired me when young to get into reading more and to look at my surroundings a bit more closely, and see a bit more mystery, fun and adventure in life. The book is now doing the rounds of my brothers and sisters and only once they are finished solving the clues will it pass to my neices and nephews. This is a definate item for my family heirloom box. Like other reviewers I would strongly recommend illustrators / writers / publishers to try to revive this form of children's clue-finding picture mystery story. Try to get a second hand copy and see for yourself why I am raving over a kid's book."
4,'Where's Waldo?' pales in comparison,"When I saw my first Where's Waldo book, I was screaming 'foul!' in immitation of this classic. I can't make new memories past three hours following my accident so I can read this book for days with the same enthusiasm as the first reading (so I'm told). Do the same to grandma and grandpa!!"
5,Why is this Out of Print?!,"I was recommended this delightful book by my cousin who had read it years ago with his now grown up children. It is a series of mysteries solved by the Black Hand Gang who make use of their keen powers of observation. There are illustrations with clues hidden in them, and you solve these mini mysteries to move ahead with the story. This combination of ""Where's Waldo"" and your standard whodunnit is tons of fun with children (age range 5-9)."
3,"Capable instuction, but expensive for what it offers","The dialogues in Ultimate Chinese are natural-sounding and current (unlike many outdated textbooks for Mandarin Chinese) but the high price of this book/CD set makes it a considerable investment in 2008, when an abundance of audio and video resources for learning Mandarin Chinese are already available online at little to no cost. Also, serious students of the language - people taking a college-level course, for example - will find the lack of emphasis on reading and writing frustrating.Nathan Dummittauthor ofChinese Through Tone & Color"
3,Okay as a supplement.,"This course would work great as a supplement to a Chinese Mandarine class, but I would not use it as a stand alone curriculum. I got it as a stand alone, and have found it to be a bit confusing. The organization is not the greatest, and the audio is all in Mandarine. It is not at all interactive, rather just to hear Mandarine. If you are looking at this as a substitute to courses like Rosetta Stone, know that what it makes up fore in price is somewhat lost in quality."
2,Not for the beginner,"For me, this package isn't well constructed.Lets take lesson 1 for instance, the very first dialogue we are given is:Wang xiaojie, hao jiu bu jian! Ni hao!It then gives the whole conversation before giving the translation in English:Miss Wang, I haven't seen you in a long time. Hello!Ok, so how are we supposed to know what word means what when you consider that Mandarin word order is mostly not the same as English?It then gives 32 words showing how different tones have different meanings. In the first lesson! Are we supposed to remember this?The audio is very fast and confusing to use - you need to be pretty good with the FFWD and REW"
2,"Distinguish book alone version, sold without audio or cds","People should understand this book is sold in a version without any audio/cds. You then have to buy separately one of two companion audio/cd programs, which the book references. Without audio of any kind, the book alone is useless unless you aren't a beginner. As long as you understand that, great. I mail ordered this sight unseen based on the Amazon reviews (but from a different vendor). When it came as a stand alone book I returned it because the cd version was cheaper than buying the book and the program counterpart separately."
5,ONE OF THE BETTER ONES,I am very happy with this item after going through 2 other smoothie machines this one seems to be built better i have threekids that use it constantly and its great for partys i love the dual machine make things a breeze
2,"Great concept, but poor execution","I bought this for my wife who likes to entertain on our patio during the summer. She often mixes up margaritas (and similar) so I thought this would be a nice produce for her parties. Unfortunately, I was wrong. It decent job of chopping and mixing, even ice, but it had significant problems elsewhere. The front drip tray was warped and would not stay in place. The motor had a strong ozone smell, like burning electrical wire. Even worse, one of my spouts leaked constantly, making a mess just sitting there. We returned this item as defective and didn't want a new one. Instead, we purchased a Margarator (which we love) and use it with our standard blender. Again, a great concept, but the product quality was not up to par."
3,It was o.k...,"I liked the fact that you could blend more than one flavor at a time. What I didn't like is it took forever to get the ice smooth enough to pour from the dispenser. I had to leave the spout open and blend at the same time to get it to work. With holding the button down, eventually you started smelling something burning."
2,"Worked well, but...","This thing does work pretty well. Blends fine and the dispenser works as advertised. But the description doesn't tell you the pitchers are made of PLASTIC. Well, that doesn't mean it's that bad, right? First time in the dishwasher on a regular cycle and it warps just enough so that the lids can't fit anymore. Oh well, time to figure out how to return this thing."
2,Wanted to Love It,I wanted to love this product but have had defective ones shipped to me. First one the button on one side arrived broken. Replacement one had a broken piece which rendered the stopper (where it pours out) worthless. I am very bummed because it would really have filled a need for us.
3,good,"The only gripe i have with this product is the container is not glass,but outherwise works as stated."
2,Not for heavy use.,Not a good product for heavy use. It is delicate and breaks easily. Too much ice causes a problem in blending. Would not buy again.
5,Great bar accessory as well as smoothies,"Makes terrificly textured smoothies and frozen cocktails. Handy to have the spigots instead of lifting the container to pour. Great to be able to have two varieties of cocktails, or to have both conventional and 'virgin' drinks for mixed age groups. High quality and professional looking, unlike some of the other 'drink' makers on the market."
4,Great little drink maker,I searched long and hard to find this type of blender that would make my wife both her diet drinks and her adult drinks. I must have read close to 50 reviews on various products. Most of the problems with this one seemed to be either out of the box or human error. When it arrived I looked for all the reported out of the box problems and did not find them. We have avoided the human error problems (don't let it sit overnight with a sticky sugar coating) and it has performed well for the past 3 months. I would buy one again.
4,reveiw of double smoothie maker,I havent used it yet but product is as pictured on amazon. The only thing I was dissappointed in was that the blenders are plastic. I am not sure if that was stated. I might have overlooked it. I just assumed they were glass because single smoothie makers that I have purchased in the past have been glass. The product is worth the price though!
2,back order,I was not told the item was no back order until after the purchase. Seller was very polite when I canceled my order. Very prompt in refund process.
5,"Goofy, groovy early swing music","Clarence Williams""The Chronological Classics: 1930-1931""(French Classics, 1995)----------------------------------------------------A fun collection of early-1930s work by bandleader Clarence Williams, one of the most intriguing and underrated figures in the early jazz scene. This album opens with several vocal tracks, easygoing riffs on bluesy standards such as ""Michigan Water Blues"" and ""You Rascal You,"" followed by a dozen or so instrumental tracks. In this case, the instrumental recordings are actually more compelling -- Williams sounded like he was mostly goofing around on the vocal tunes, but the groovy instrumental tunes form a perfect bridge between his kinetic trad-jazz origins and the more rounded, swank sound of classic big band swing. Also included are a few songs featuring Williams' wife, singer Eva Taylor, who I always find delightful. Great stuff - highly recommended! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Music Guide)"
3,*Sigh*,"I was really impressed with the first Bloody Roar. It was fast, had lots of moves, and the characters were original. Then the second one came out, better graphics, slow as hell. So now Bloody Roar 3 came out, how exciting!!! Some new characters, barely any moves, to be honest graphics weren't that great (for PS2) and finally when I put a game on the easiest skill level I expect the game to cut me some slack, but when...if you get to the last boss, Uranus, dont be to dissapointed when you have to play the whole game again because you couldn't touch or block her. Great idea big dissapointment."
5,ROOOAR!!!!,"I have fond memories of countless hours of playing this game. playing against my brothers and having tournaments with my friends. if you love fighting games, this is a must have for you game library. thanx for the nostalgia, Red Label Games!!!"
3,Bloody Roar 3 coulda been better.....although it was good.,"Bloody Roar, out of all the 3D fighters out there, was a favorite of mine(like Street Fighter EX). I'll admit, the series has always been a favorite of mine. Don't get me wrong, Bloody Roar 3 is a good game. Definitely. But, I had higher hopes for the series debut on the PS2. The graphics are lush, detailed. Gameplay is topnotch. But, it just seemed something was lacking from the game to me.Would I recommend it for PS fans? Definitely.For full price? Eh, I dunno. I suppose.Just because I had higher hopes for it doesn't mean it is poor. It is a good game just not quite what I expected it to be on the PS2. One I recommend to all fighting game fans, for sure."
2,A shame,"I wanted to love this game like I did tekken and virtua butit just didnt make my day. Like say that anoying song that never stops. When your fighting it depends on luck not skill. The story is so lame and all the caracters look stupid except for my favorite Gado. Gado has always had that kick that you can beat anyone with. Anyway If your looking for a good fighting game I would recomend bloody roar 1,2, Tekken 3,4, and vitua fighter 4."
5,"TEN DOGS, TEN PAJAMAS","i HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS ,IT STAYS YOUR DOG WARM AND IT LOOKS SOOOO CUTE.I HAVE TEN DOGS YORKIES,SHIH TZU CHIHUAHUA AND POODLE AND EACH ONE OF THEM HAS A PAJAMA THEY LOOK SOOO CUTE.!!!THIS PAJAMA HELPED MY CHIHUAHUA WHO HAS BREATHING PROBLEMS LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Doggie Pajamas,"These doggie pajamas are very cute but run small. I have an 11-pound Chihuahua mix. Small size ""doggie""'clothing usually fits him well but these pj's are a little tight."
2,Okay,"This isn't ""great"". If you can print out a picture of a constellation, and figure out where North is, on your own, then you have done just about all that this little thing can do."
